<p class="fst"><strong>1. CCP official spokesman,Chin Po-ku</strong>, Chungking, Novembers 1938:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;China needs Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek&#8217;s leadership more urgently than ever today when the national crisis has reached a life and death stage. His remaining in office and his valuable services to the Chinese nation are essential and imperative in the struggle leading to final victory. The Chinese Communist Party has placed unquestioning confidence in Chiang Kai-shek&#8217;s fixed policy of conducting a war of resistance. No-one else can lead this war except Generalissimo Chiang&#8217; (to the People&#8217;s Political Council).</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>2. Wang Ming</strong> (CCP delegate to the Communist International, in <strong>Comintern</strong> 14/10 October 1937:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;We Chinese Communists openly declare that we support the Kuomintang and the Nanking government (of Chiang Kai-shek), and will fight shoulder to shoulder with them against Japanese imperialism&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>3. Report, 6th Plenum of the 6th Central Committee</strong>, CCP, October 1938 (omitted from <strong>Selected Works</strong> of Mao Tse-tung):</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;In the course of its glorious history, the Kuomintang has been responsible for the overthrow of the Ch&#8217;ing, the establishment of the Republic, opposition to Yuan Shi-k&#8217;ai, establishment of the Three Principles of uniting with Russia, with the Communist Party, and with the workers and peasants in the great revolution of 1926-7. Today, it is once more leading the great anti-Japanese war ... it has had two great leaders in succession-Mr Sun Yat-sen and Mr Chiang Kai-shek ... One can foresee a brilliant future for the Kuomintang.&#8217;</p>
