<p class="fst">In Asia today, the case for state capitalism depends upon China
putting up an economic performance that is dramatically superior to
that of other countries. Very often it seems that the gap is so
great, the case is hardly worth arguing. Anything that questions
China&rsquo;s excellent economic record must be CIA propaganda.</P>
<P>Economic growth does not, of course, necessarily mean economic
development. Output can grow at the same time as most people remain
unaffected &ndash; remain, for example, employed in agriculture.
Again, output can grow while conditions for the majority even get
worse.</P>
<P>For anyone familiar with Calcutta who visits Canton or Shanghai,
the contrast is very sharp &ndash; on the one hand, the appalling
conditions of a very large proportion of people and the ostentatious
luxury of a minority; on the other, austerity but apparently an
adequate diet and considerable equality.</P>
<P>For many people that is enough. For many liberals sympathetic to
China, it is enough that China appears a fairer society than India
(although they would not accept that, on similar criteria, British
capitalism is &lsquo;fairer&rsquo; than either). But for a poor man
in India this consideration is &ndash; in the absence of any other
alternative &ndash; decisive.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, it is not enough. We need to know how secure is
China&rsquo;s achievement &ndash; can it continue to raise the
condition of its people, industrialise and defend its borders?</P>
<P>In the 1960s, the backward countries increased defence spending by
114 per cent; Asia by 84 per cent; China by 161 per cent. The
appalling burden of defence on an economy as poor as China&rsquo;s is
the requirement of survival in an imperialist dominated world. If
defence is crippling the industrialisation of other backward
countries, why will it not do so in China? It is not enough just to
stand still.</P>
<P>The original claim of Stalinist state capitalism was not merely to
a fairer distribution system, but to world power &ndash; the
&lsquo;proletarian base&rsquo; would grow to engulf capitalism
itself, not just create a more decent regime at home.</P>
<P>This means that, among other things, the gap between China and the
industrialised countries must be closing to the point where the
People&rsquo;s Republic can unequivocally show that its system is the
only way forward for the peoples of the world.</P>
<P>If we leave aside all other aspects of present-day China, however,
what has been the record in terms of economic growth? How does it
measure against the performance of the only country that comes
anywhere near it in size, India? Unfortunately, the statistics are
far from reliable. India&rsquo;s economy is known in some detail and
with some accuracy. China&rsquo;s cannot be.</P>
<P>No continuous series of statistics on the national economy or
particular sectors have been published by Peking since 1959. The
population figures date from the census of 1953 (since when there
have been two complete censuses in India, 1961 and 1971), which was
itself not very reliable. This means that nobody really knows the
size of China&rsquo;s population (the possible range is enormous),
and therefore, how far &ndash; say &ndash; grain output is capable of
feeding it.</P>
<P>The Chinese government itself uses different estimates &ndash; the
Ministry of Commerce seems to use the figure of 830 million people;
the Ministry of Food 800 million; the planning department &lsquo;less
than 750 million&rsquo; &ndash; a range of 80 million! In 1972 Chou
En-lai spoke vaguely of the present rate of growth of population as
&lsquo;around two per cent&rsquo;, which could represent a change
from 1953 to under two per cent or something virtually the same as
India&rsquo;s 2.47 per cent (1971 census).</P>
<P>The position is not everywhere as bad however. The figures
published up to 1959, plus some of the recent issued statistics, plus
what is known about the rough proportions of the Chinese economy,
some hints, isolated facts and so on, provide a rough guide.</P>
<P>Some of the sources for particular years are American, for US
imperialism has the most powerful interest in identifying what is
happening in China. We are not dealing here with the wild prejudices
of the popular press, but with careful estimates, some of them
exceedingly favourable to China (since there are many pro-China
American sinologists). They are no more lies than Chinese government
claims are lies.</P>
<P>The Peking government refuses to publish its own account, we have
to rely on what sources there are &ndash; while always checking the
Chinese basis for those sources.</P>
<P>India and China began from very different base points. China is
much larger &ndash; its population may be 40 to 50 per cent above
that of India &ndash; and its agriculture has always been much
richer. Agriculture is overwhelmingly the most important activity in
both countries, and within agriculture, the production of food
grains.</P>
<P>Given the higher Chinese productivity &ndash; some say it has been
consistently higher since the tenth century <A HREF="#n1" NAME="f1">[1]</A>
&ndash; the overall output per head in the Chinese economy as a whole
would be significantly higher. <A HREF="#n2" NAME="f2">[2]</A> On the
other hand, the military needs of British imperialism in India
resulted in a much more extensive network of roads and railways,
covering a much smaller land area, and that factor is important in
the speed of growth.</P>
<P>Taking the main areas of the economy, what is the picture?<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>1. Agriculture</h4>

<p class="fst">Food grains production dominates agriculture in both countries. So
the annual grain harvest is the most significant single index of the
performance of the economy. The graph shows the respective output of
China and India. The Indian figures are official. The Chinese
contain, for particular periods, different estimates.</P>
<P>The figures are difficult to compare. Normally Chinese grain
statistics are for <I>unhusked</I> rice and include for example &ndash;
unlike the Indian &ndash; potatoes. Nevertheless the direction of the
graphs is not affected by this factor (the Chinese figures are
adjusted to allow for dehusking).</P>
<P>If we compare the first and last years for both countries, we get
a rate of increase per year of 1.8 per cent for India and 2.6 for
China, but this is distorted by the peculiarity of the two years &ndash;
had we taken, for example, 1970-71 for India and 1971 for China, the
annual rate of growth would be 3.9 per cent for India and 3.3 for
China. To flatten out the accidents of particular years, we can
compare the first five and the last five years:</P>

<p class="fst">We can alter the assumptions and estimates, and get slight
variations in these figures <A HREF="#n3" NAME="f3">[3]</A>, but the
overall conclusion remains &ndash; the rate of growth of food grains
output of both countries has been much the same averaging, over a
quarter of a century&rsquo;s sustained development effort, something
around two per cent per year &ndash; perhaps just about keeping level
with the rate of growth of population. The gap between Indian and
Chinese total output remains roughly constant &ndash; with perhaps a
very small tendency for it to decrease.</P>

<p class="fst">Of course, from the graph we can see that the performance in
detail has striking contrasts. The fluctuations in Chinese output are
much greater than in India. When Chinese grain output expands, it
does so much more rapidly, but it also falls much more drastically.
Indeed, paradoxically, the economic fluctuations of &lsquo;socialism&rsquo;
are much greater than those of capitalism on this evidence.</P>
<P>In non-food grain items of agricultural output, India&rsquo;s
performance seems to have been better (presumably, the price
incentive of private capitalism for commercial crops has affected
this). Since 1957, it seems, India&rsquo;s total agricultural output
has grown by about three per cent per year and China&rsquo;s by just
over two per cent. <A HREF="#n4" NAME="f4">[4]</A></P>
<P>Again, it has to be stressed that the importance of these figures
is not that they can be relied upon (or rather the Chinese figures
cannot be relied upon) but that the evidence does not suggest China&rsquo;s
performance is much better than India&rsquo;s. This is particularly
odd given what is known about China&rsquo;s massive efforts to
develop agriculture.</P>
<P>For example, the output of China&rsquo;s chemical fertiliser
industry is said to have been 17 million metric tons in 1971; in
India, consumption of chemical fertiliser barely reached 5&frac12;
million tons (the figures are not strictly comparable, since the
Chinese figures include eight million tons from the &lsquo;traditional
sector&rsquo;, whereas the Indian figures cover only the &lsquo;modern
sector&rsquo;).</P>
<P>The number of tractors in use in China was said to have reached
135,000 in 1956, but only 31,000 in India by 1961. The failure of the
land reform of India, the continuation of small fragmented holdings,
must have impeded the expansion of output and further exaggerated
India&rsquo;s relative disadvantage.</P>
<P>Chinese land has always been more intensively cultivated, the
irrigated area proportionately larger, and the per hectare yield
consistently higher. The explanation for China&rsquo;s relatively
poor performance lies in the interruptions suffered by production
rather than its potential for growth. Indeed, given the
interruptions, the sheer superiority of Chinese agriculture is shown
in its ability to achieve nevertheless the same performance as India.
If expansion had been sustained, China surely would have drawn much
further ahead of India.</P>
<P>Agriculture usually provides the main source of surplus for
capital accumulation in an industrialising backward country. The
possibility of industrial growth is closely related to agriculture&rsquo;s
growth and fluctuations in the fortunes of agriculture can have a
powerful effect on the industrial sector.</P>
<P>Both the Indian and Chinese governments have in practice been
forced to subordinate their respective economies to the short-run
performance of agriculture, to the power of dominant rural groups.
<A HREF="#n5" NAME="f5">[5]</A></P>
<P>This was made necessary by the relative stagnation of agriculture,
the very low level of livelihood of the rural population (a higher
rate of exploitation would have led to mass refusal to work or to
starvation), and the lack of any alternative source of capital.
Defence is also a major drain on what surplus there is. The
industrial sector has to be seen against this backcloth.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>2. Industry</h4>

<p class="fst">China&rsquo;s industrial growth has an even more extreme pattern
of fluctuation than its agriculture. The official index of industrial
production (including handicrafts) rose from 100 in 1956 to a claimed
258 in 1959 (and, from one official source, 332 in 1960) only to fall
back to 184 in 1963 and 212 in 1964. <A HREF="#n6" NAME="f6">[6]</A>
A revision of this index <A HREF="#n7" NAME="f7">[7]</A> moderates
the size of changes so that 1959 becomes 189 and 1962 110
(1963:&nbsp;121). In the machine building sector, Cheng has
constructed an index (1957:&nbsp;100) which registered a dizzy 305 in
1960 and 122 in 1962.</P>
<P>By contrast, India&rsquo;s progress has been much slower but has
suffered less drastic drops. The 1956:100 index fell only once prior
to 1970 (in 1966, by 0.7 per cent) although output has been extremely
sluggish in some years. India&rsquo;s overall rate of growth, 1957 to
1970, is put at some six per cent per year (6.6 per cent for the
modern sector; 4 per cent if the small-scale sector is included). The
real growth phase &ndash; through the second and third plans &ndash;
disintegrated in the later sixties and has still not recovered.</P>
<P>China also experienced its highest rates of growth in the fifties
&ndash; some 19 per cent per year during the first five year plan.
This very high figure was partly the result of much unused capacity
available after the war &ndash; whereas India&rsquo;s industrial
capacity had been over-utilised without proper replacement &ndash;
the boom that came with the Korean war and the attempt to meet
China&rsquo;s needs from its home resources rather than imports.
Since then China&rsquo;s growth rate has declined to something around
six per cent. <A HREF="#n8" NAME="f8">[8]</A></P>
<P>This is no &lsquo;new model&rsquo;, but merely an accommodation to
a particularly forbidding material reality. The propaganda of the
Chinese regime suggests that, once imperialism is expelled, internal
organisation and morale are the keys to development.</P>
<P>No amount of morale, however, can make up for the gross shortage
of resources. Decentralisation is the result of a relatively poor
long-term economic performance (relative, that is, to what is
required to shift the structure of employment), a response to
stagnant employment, rather than the reason for what growth takes
place.</P>
<P>In fact, decentralisation positively restricts the full potential
of the economy by dispersing scarce resources &ndash; although it may
make for a quieter political life at the local level. [And] it also
makes it almost impossible to have a serious national plan, and state
planning has been one of the casualties of economic stagnation in
both India and China.</P>
<P>The immediate prospects for each economy are different. Industrial
output in India is only very sluggishly climbing out of a long drawn
out recession, and agriculture in Western India is in severe crisis
(although because the area is in any case poor, this will not have
such great effects on the overall figures).</P>
<P>China&rsquo;s industrial output is expanding rapidly, but
agriculture has been checked quite sharply in some areas (China&rsquo;s
purchase of grain abroad is one factor in pushing the world price
up). If the agricultural performance remains poor in both countries,
sooner or later it will lead to a cutback in industry.</P>
<P>But the picture could be changed very quickly. Both countries try
to use the world market as a means of compensating for difficulties
at home &ndash; China has now expanded its foreign trade to the same
sort of size as India&rsquo;s (China&rsquo;s foreign trade is valued
at about 4,200 million US dollars; India&rsquo;s &ndash; on the
latest figures (1970&ndash;71) &ndash; at 4,164 million US dollars).</P>
<P>Of course, India&rsquo;s past external borrowing has reached the
stage where it is a crippling burden on its foreign trade now,
whereas China does not bear such a burden. Almost certainly, however,
the Chinese government will move towards trying to use the resources
of foreign capitalism for China&rsquo;s development &ndash; by
accepting credits and loans to make up for domestic shortages with
foreign imports.</P>
<P>Imperialism dominates the world market. Its forces compel the
defence expenditure which is a major burden upon China&rsquo;s
economy and to a lesser extent upon India&rsquo;s. Backwardness and
the price of development today reduce the massive efforts made in
both countries to little more than standing still in development
terms.</P>
<P>Everyone knows that Indian capitalism is rotten to the core and
has no serious perspective of development. The lack of any
perspective, however, also afflicts China. Stalin&rsquo;s aim of
&lsquo;socialism in one country&rsquo; became in the 1950s
&lsquo;development in one country&rsquo;; but even that is now
impossible.</P>
<P>Development can only take place on a world scale &ndash; unlocking
the accumulated resources of world imperialism for the development of
the whole world. The reformist-nationalist alternative &ndash;
gradual economic development in one country &ndash; has become
Utopian. It can no longer be a substitute for world revolution.</P>
<P>Both countries have made important advances. Both have programmes,
for example, in the fields of aerospace and nuclear energy, in
electronics and computers. In both, the engineering and petrochemical
industries have had strikingly high rates of growth.</P>
<P>China still depends on imports for much of its needs in heavy
vehicles, special steels, ocean shipping, modern aircraft, chemical,
metallurgical and oil refining equipment (although it meets 80 per
cent of its needs for machinery at home, in comparison to 15 per cent
in the fifties).</P>
<P>India&rsquo;s dependence on imports of complete units is less than
China&rsquo;s, but is much greater on imported components for a much
wider field of manufacturing. Technically, India&rsquo;s productive
capacity is almost certainly more advanced than China&rsquo;s, and
the modern units on a much larger scale; as a result, the diversity
of output is greater and more sophisticated.</P>
<P>But in absolute terms, China&rsquo;s output is, in many fields,
much larger than India&rsquo;s. In steel the contrast is most
dramatic &ndash; China&rsquo;s output in the modern sector is some 14
million tons, with another seven from the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo;
sector; India&rsquo;s total output is about seven million tons.</P>
<P>This says nothing about the quality or diversity of steels
produced, nor about the base point: China&rsquo;s peak steel output
during the Second World War was 13 million tons, whereas India&rsquo;s
probably never went much over one million. <A HREF="#n9" NAME="f9">[9]</A></P>
<P>At its most optimistic, China&rsquo;s performance is considerably
better than India&rsquo;s, and on the less optimistic, slightly
better. But in both cases, there is nothing which distinguishes
China&rsquo;s growth today over some 25 years as the Soviet Union was
distinguished between 1928 and 1953.</P>
<P>China started from a far lower base point than did Russia (China&rsquo;s
grain output per head in 1952 was less than half that in the Soviet
Union in 1928 <A HREF="#n10" NAME="f10">[10]</A>, and the price of
development is now incomparably higher. The Russian rulers pillaged
agriculture and robbed the industrial workers to maintain a breakneck
pace of industrialization. In neither China nor India is this
possible.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>3. Development</h4>

<p class="fst">In any case, the growth of output today does not show changes in
employment (and that is what constitutes development). It is here
that the ruling classes of India and China have grounds for real
pessimism. Neither economy has shown any sustained ability to employ
its available labour force.</P>
<P>Peking&rsquo;s emphasis on labour productivity in Chinese
factories &ndash; despite other efforts to increase employment in the
countryside &ndash; have the same effect as in India. The Chinese
leadership has been much more ruthless than the Indian in using the
rural areas as places of exile for surplus urban labour &ndash; in
order to minimise urban labour costs and preserve low prices of
industrial output. The maintenance of strictest police controls round
China&rsquo;s cities to prevent people getting in to them shows how
far the mass of the rural population willingly accept this state of
affairs. <A HREF="#n11" NAME="f11">[11]</A></P>
<P>There are no useful estimates of unemployment in either country
since &lsquo;unemployment&rsquo; only makes sense where everyone goes
through labour exchanges for jobs and a job means something clear and
measurable.</P>
<P>Yet the growth of the population entails a certain growth in the
<I>labour force</I>; and the growth in industrial and agricultural
output entails a certain increase in the <I>number of jobs</I>. And
on any evidence, the first is wildly larger than the second.</P>
<P>Both countries are large enough to mobilise resources on a scale
sufficient to change the overall output of their respective
economies. But not by any new methods. China&rsquo;s leadership is
committed to building heavy industry &ndash; as its leaders readily
admit <A HREF="#n12" NAME="f12">[12]</A> &ndash; but cannot do so
except by first trying slowly to improve agriculture. <A HREF="#n13" NAME="f13">[13]</A></P>
