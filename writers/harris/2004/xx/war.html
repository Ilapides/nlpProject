<p class="fst">I am most grateful to the editor of this journal for allowing me
to comment on Phil Marfleet&#8217;s <a href="../../../marfleet/2003/xx/harris.html" target="new">review</a> of my recent book in <strong>International Socialism 101</strong> (Winter 2003). It is bad taste to comment
on a review of one of one&#8217;s works, but since Phil is &#8211; like a few
other SWP members &#8211; an old friend, it would be discourteous not to
note his hard work and his stout defence of the faith. It is also an
unexpected pleasure, as a former editor of this journal&#8217;s immediate
ancestor, to contribute to your discussions. Phil has misconstrued
some things, but has got much of my case right. I list some points:<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The context: a little history</h4>

<p class="fst">In the spring of 1960, when Tony Cliff and Michael Kidron with a
small group of us started the first series of <strong>International
Socialism</strong>, it had a subtitle, <em>Journal of Socialist Theory</em>.
By implication, what passed for socialist theory &#8211; after the
ravages of Stalinism and the successive dilutions of social democracy
&#8211; was quite inadequate for an understanding of the modern world,
let alone for undertaking action that connected aims and strategy.
Without constant reconnection between aims and a rapidly changing
world, theory easily became a set of quasi-religious mantras,
esoteric marks of group identity rather than guides to action &#8211; and
the history of Trotskyist sects is sadly replete with too many examples.</p>

<p>Tony Cliff began this reconstruction of theory in his application
of the concept of state capitalism to Russia, Eastern Europe and
China, and his rejection of Trotsky&#8217;s absurd idea of a &#8216;degenerated
workers&#8217; state&#8217;. Mike Kidron set out to understand why world
capitalism, characterised before the Second World War as apparently
in permanent stagnation (in Trotsky&#8217;s 1938 <strong>Transitional
Programme</strong>, the epoch was one of war and mass unemployment) was in
the 1950s expanding with unprecedented speed (and far from mass
unemployment, was sucking workers in from the rest of the world). His
answer turned upon unprecedented levels of peacetime arms spending,
lowering the organic composition of capital and thus offsetting the
tendency of the rate of profit to fall, a thesis later absorbed into
his idea of permanent waste in the system.</p>

<p>However, more important in my view was his analysis of foreign
investment in India and the transition from the old order of
capitalism, imperialism (identified in his last unpublished
manuscript as &#8216;middle capitalism&#8217;, between the primitive
accumulation phase and the present order), with a built-in
competitive drive to the expropriation and incorporation of
territory. By 1960 that drive had largely gone into reverse and
decolonisation was all the rage. In his work on India he identified &#8211;
in my view, with remarkable prescience &#8211; the transition to a
post-imperial order, &#8216;world capitalism&#8217;. He showed that much of
what we identified as essentially capitalist &#8211; for example, the
size of firm and its relationship to the state &#8211; was in fact only a
feature of the old order. In the new order that was emerging, he
found what we were to describe a decade or more later as
&#8216;multinational corporations&#8217; which did not depend on any one
state but related to many states.</p>

<p>In the second half of the 1960s, with a radical transformation of
the political scene, IS turned to building a party, to intervene in
events rather than analyse them. Mike Kidron, already identifying the
green movement as the most appropriate spearhead of radical social
change in the current phase of the system (a commitment most fully
worked out in his final manuscript in the 1990s), reacted to the
proposal to transform IS into a revolutionary party as characteristic
of the old order of capitalism, imperialism and the centralised
fusion of state and capital. He left IS to service the new radical
movement through publishing. However, he continued some work and
seems to have remained fascinated as late as 1977 by the dominant
role of the state in modern capitalism, the onward march of state
capitalism <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>, a view in my opinion justly reproved by Chris Harman
for omitting the phenomenon of globalisation. By contrast, I had gone
in the opposite direction, believing that globalisation would wash
away the foundations of state capitalism and privatise the state, a
thesis explored in my current book. But in the end Mike completed his
project, in the 1990s, in his unpublished manuscript. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p>However, the purpose of this little excursus is not to indulge an
old man&#8217;s sentimental reminiscing, but to indicate that the
founders of this journal saw the bold critical rethinking of theory,
with the overall objective of the self-liberation of the working
class and of humanity, as crucial for action. Much of Phil&#8217;s
self-righteous indignation seems to be directed at any such
enterprise. Like those Muslims who believe that the whole of useful
human knowledge is already incorporated in the <strong>Koran</strong>, Phil
seems to imply that everything we need to know is already known.</p>

<p>I started my work from the accelerating globalisation of the 1980s
and 1990s, propelled initially by trade, then by capital movements,
and now by services and the migration of labour. The work Phil
reviews is the fifth book <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> trying to understand the implications
of globalisation for our theoretical inheritance. In many of these
earlier works I dodged what was apparently the inadequacy of the
traditional Marxist view of the relationship between private capital,
business and the state, merged in the single concept, capitalism.</p>

<p>Globalisation, however, glaringly exposes this inadequacy, and
reveals just how narrowly national the analysis of Marx and the
Marxists has been &#8211; with the &#8216;international&#8217; (relationships
between states) grafted on as an afterthought. Of course, we could
not have seen this in the heyday of a system then dominated by states
and national capitals, nor perhaps could we have seen that,
historically, those who wield the forces of physical coercion,
states, always dominate all other social forces, including capital
(not the other way round).<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>So what is &#8216;globalisation&#8217;?</h4>

<p class="fst">It is, in my book, the tendency for the emergence of a single
world economy out of the national components of the old system.
Economic networks, political boundaries and citizenry come apart. It
is a blind process, driven by markets, not the intentions of the
participants. Governments, out of short term interests, sometimes
facilitate the process or are forced to do so; sometimes they fight
it, but even when they facilitate it, they do so with great
reluctance since they recognise that it undermines the forms of their
old domination over a clearly defined territory, a share of the
world&#8217;s population and of the world&#8217;s capital stock. Above all,
globalisation allows capital to escape the state, to go offshore &#8211;
the old national economy becomes a fragment of a global whole which
is ultimately outside the control of the state. There are a host of
ramifications which are the substance of my book.</p>

<p>If my formulation is correct, it transforms what we suppose is the
historic relationship between capital and the state. I was obliged to
re-examine the historical record. That was the point of my historical
introduction. I was not concerned with history in general, only a
narrow slice related to my theme. Phil does spend a lot of time on
the history and obviously feels more comfortable here, away from the
two thirds of the book which concerns the modern period. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> He is
full of suggestions as to what I have left out, but it is all
irrelevant to my theme. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> What Phil does not say is what, if
anything, globalisation means; perhaps he thinks it is a fashionable
falsehood got up by the chattering classes, and the real world is as
it was in 1960 or 1930 or whenever &#8211; capitalism is, as in some
religious doctrine, always the same and ever will be. He says, as my
book does, the relationship between capital and the state is
complicated, changing at different times, but on what it is now,
where history doesn&#8217;t help, he dodges the issue. But he gets cross
when I suggest that business has in general no more power over
governments than populations (though electorates can be pretty
decisive); that is the point of the Nazi example &#8211; German business
had nearly as little influence over the Nazis as the mass of ordinary
Germans but, again, he dodges the point.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Moralising</h4>

<p class="fst">Phil says I allege that the state is &#8216;an incubus, an alien
force&#8217; (I do not &#8211; this is his invention), and in Phil&#8217;s
Manichean world, &#8216;a struggle between good and evil&#8217; (p.&nbsp;135),
business is &#8216;innocent&#8217;. And then again (p.&nbsp;137), I am
supposed to say that &#8216;commercial capital has an unblemished record&#8217;
(I don&#8217;t). In the middle of a Parmalat crisis, and just after
Enron, what can he be talking about? It seems that &#8211; like President
Bush &#8211; unable to argue, he must resort to moralising. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> It allows
him, like an old lady faced with a flasher, to whip himself into a
lather of shock, horror and dismay. Yet we all know the business
class is full of crooks, thieves and rip-off artists, none of them
with an interest in globalisation or free trade if they can get their
noses in the trough of state contracts and monopolies or can rig the market.</p>

<p>What business does not generally do is direct the forces of
physical coercion, the terrifying remorseless brutality and
destruction that is normally the exclusive monopoly of the state.
These are Lenin&#8217;s &#8216;bodies of armed men&#8217;. Perhaps Phil thinks
otherwise and really it is Israeli businessmen who are killing
Palestinians, Yukos which is bombing Chechnya, Esso which is strafing
Afghans and Iraqis? By confusing the undoubted horrors of some forms
of exploitation with those of sheer physical slaughter and
destruction he is hiding the enemy &#8211; without saying why.</p>

<p>Later he lapses into invention again &#8211; I am supposed to believe
that if &#8216;only governments would understand&#8217; (p.&nbsp;141), they
would embrace globalisation. This is a staggering distortion &#8211; the
book is all about states fighting globalisation because it undermines
their power. He has completely missed the point. But I suppose if you
see the world in moral categories, a more complex case is difficult
to follow (witness George Bush again).<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Reform and revolution</h4>

<p class="fst">I am surprised Phil did not attack my argument that reformism
works. The millions of NGOs which, in every tiny detail of the
system, police, campaign, attack, sue, have had remarkable successes
even against the mightiest corporations. Phil is just grumpy &#8211; and
ungrateful &#8211; about this amazing affirmation of popular power, the
most spectacular political transformation of a globalising world.</p>

<p>More important, however, is the fact that capitalism has worked
and for the foreseeable future will continue to work, far more
spectacularly than anything expected in 1938 or lauded in <strong>The
Communist Manifesto</strong>. There is no space to lay out the evidence here
(and Phil dislikes facts). Suffice it to say that in 1870 the average
British person had an expectation of life of 41 (and the average
hours worked, 2,984 per year); in 2001, 78 (and 1,653 hours). In
developing countries, the change was very much more dramatic &#8211;
average expectation of life in India, 32 (1870 and 1950), now 66. And
the quality of life behind these figures, despite all the failures,
has improved at breathtaking speed over the past two decades.
Furthermore, poverty has decreased &#8211; the population said to be
living on less than $1 per day has fallen from 37 percent in 1970 to
29 percent in 1980 and 22 percent now. True, not enough, full of
hideous distortions and failures, but still fairly impressive. If you
can&#8217;t see a victory when it appears, how will you know when you&#8217;ve
been defeated? Did Phil not notice or is he wedded to the ancient
religious proposition that the end of the world is always nigh? In
the 1950s Tony Cliff had much fun mocking those Trotskyists who said,
because of what Trotsky said in 1938, that there was, contrary to all
appearances, mass unemployment and the Second World War had not ended.</p>

<p>However, there is also a conceptual argument as to why revolution
has become outdated. If globalisation has allowed capital to escape
the national state, then revolution in any one national component
will no longer capture the material foundations of that society. And
indeed, any post-revolutionary order will be bent to fit the
prevailing world material foundations. The whole revolutionary
project was national and has now fallen apart. More &#8211; and I am
surprised at Phil&#8217;s lack of rage at this account &#8211; classes were
not fashioned, I argue, in the relations of production, but in the
class struggle to conquer the central focus of national power, the
state. Thus, at the world level, there can be no class &#8216;for itself&#8217;
because there is no world state. Of course, there is a world ruling
class in itself, fractured between different states, corporations,
international agencies, but it cannot be a class for itself without a
state. Globalisation does not mean just scaling up to a world level.</p>
<p>Of course, many countries can only make progress if the local
state can be overthrown, and it will resist by force, making
revolution the only option. But this is no general case, and I prefer
to accept Marx&#8217;s 1872 observation that workers could gain their
ends in the advanced world without revolution. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> If there&#8217;s
anyone left who remembers the origins of IS, Henry Collins was right. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<h4>The state</h4>

<p class="fst">Phil has again got it so wrong, the reverse of what I said. He
writes: &#8216;Harris believes that the state has always been
dysfunctional&#8217; (p.&nbsp;134). No, I don&#8217;t. The core argument of
the historical introduction, following Marx, is that the state played
an absolutely decisive role in forcing the accelerated accumulation
of capital. By implication, without the state, this process would
either not have occurred or have been immensely delayed. How could
Phil have missed this? It must be my opaque style. However, by the
20th century, in a different age, the competition of states
threatened, in two world wars, the very dissolution of the system and
of all capital.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Third World</h4>

<p class="fst">Phil thinks I believe that &#8216;if only such growth [of the 1950s
and 1960s] could be resumed, all would be well&#8217;. No, I don&#8217;t, and
there is no such suggestion in my book since it would be absurd. What
happened in this little corner of the Atlantic economy in those two
decades was tiny in comparison to the gigantic boom &#8211; far, far
bigger in terms of the numbers of people involved &#8211; that occurred
in the 1980s and 1990s. Was Phil asleep and missed it? Did he not
notice the spectacular growth of what we used to call the four little
tigers (Korea, Taiwan, etc.), the no less spectacular growth in South
East Asia (now resumed after the blip of 1997), followed by the quite
stupendous growth of China, making it now the third largest trading
power in the world. And now it seems, at long last, that India has
begun to grow. And yet just like Africa &#8211; well described by Phil &#8211;
these were all colonised (and China was wrecked). How do we explain
the extraordinary difference in recent history? But more important,
how could Phil have missed it? Or perhaps he thinks all those vast
square miles of factories in Guangdong or the Yangtze delta are a
bubble that will be pricked, that the mirage will disappear leaving
his archaic assumptions comfortably intact: in the beginning was the
faith and reality must never penetrate it.</p>

<p>And how does this change square with Phil&#8217;s amazingly archaic
picture of the Third World as the Congo writ large: &#8216;the
multinationals have made merry while hundreds of millions have been
pushed to the margins of survival&#8217;. It&#8217;s a fine picture, dated I
guess about 1966 in the heyday of dependency theory &#8211; the Third
World as a prostrate victim, savaged by predatory multinationals &#8211;
but a fantasy. Famine, savage perpetual civil war, crippling
corruption are all there &#8211; the only absentees are the
multinationals, off in Asia making profits (there are precious few of
those in Africa). Furthermore, as Mike Kidron argued so well in the
1960s, &#8216;Third Worldism&#8217; &#8211; blaming everything on the foreigner,
imperialism, etc. &#8211; has the result of exonerating the local rulers.
If I may be allowed to emulate Phil&#8217;s style, he is quite shameless
in his defence of the Idi Amins, the Charles Taylors, the Kabilas,
the Mugabes who have so catastrophically wrecked Africa, with barely
any help from outside (apart from the provision of banking facilities
for the loot).<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The future</h4>

<p class="fst">The Asian example suggests that the economic stagnation of the
Third World was more exclusion than exploitation, being locked out
during the interwar economic crisis (and in the 1950s, making a
virtue of this exclusion with import substitution programmes). For
short term tactical advantages the leading powers opened the door a
little (while all the time trying to cheat), leading to this quite
unanticipated but momentous change, perhaps the most momentous since
the industrial revolution. It is set to continue and grow stronger
due to the conjuncture of a unique set of circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>some 90 percent of the addition to the world&#8217;s labour
force will occur in developing countries over the next 20 to 30
years, at the same time as they will already have, for demographic
reasons, a great bunching of the population in the working age
groups;<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>in the developed world, the labour force, particularly the
younger workforce, again for demographic reasons, is set for radical
reduction, and the response will, in the medium term, mean major
worker migration flows;<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>the continuing massive investments in education in
developing countries will mean that the overwhelming bulk of the
world&#8217;s literate workers will be concentrated in developing
countries; <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>technology will continue to facilitate the unbundling of
manufacturing and services, locating interdependent activities
worldwide wherever profits can be maximised;<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>with the almost complete mobility of capital, this would
suggest the relocation of most of the world economy to the
developing countries over the next half century &#8211; already we can
see what has happened in manufacturing in China, and now, in
outsourcing services to India (and these two alone account for
nearly a third of the world&#8217;s population).</li>
</ul>

<p class="fst">But this transformation is only possible if the dominant powers do
not try to block the process. Poverty in the Third World is sustained
not by the multinationals, but by things like the EU Common
Agricultural Policy (which simultaneously robs European consumers,
especially the poor, and Third World exporters) or US subsidies to
its handful of cotton farmers, screwing two of the poorest &#8211; but
cotton-exporting &#8211; countries in the world, Mali and Mauritania.</p>
<p>In this enormous transition, between, say, 1970 and 2050, it is
markets which are reorganising the world&#8217;s economic geography, not
governments, much less those tiny international organisations which
arouse such ire (and so let governments off the hook). The WTO is an
arena for states to bargain dominated by the biggest states, not a
force in its own right, and even then there&#8217;s a strong argument
that it has had little effect on trade. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> The IMF, for short term
external crises, has a greater role for some countries, but in
serious crises (Mexico, 1994; Argentina, 2001) only the US Treasury
has the muscle to intervene; again, the IMF is very small in the sum
of things, and there is evidence that it is fairly ineffective &#8211;
governments flout its conditions with impunity. In the end it is
governments which decide what to inflict on their citizens, but they
love to dodge responsibility by blaming the IMF (as Callaghan did in
Britain in the 1960s). As to the World Bank <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a>, the funds it
mobilises are tiny &#8211; $12 billion to $15 billion net per year, or
roughly equal to the cumulative debt of Parmalat (and compared to,
say, the $400 billion defence budget of the US or $200 billion daily
foreign exchange dealings in London); it is institutionally if not
financially corrupt (it is bent to suit the politics of the dominant
powers who run it, and to the interests of the borrowers). It is an
official body, i.e. non profit making public sector, and essentially
social democratic in stance, focusing its low interest loans
officially on reducing poverty and cutting defence spending (in
favour of health and education). Above all, it is ineffective, a
secret it tries to conceal at all costs. It is &#8211; compared to Chase
Manhattan, Citibank, Barclays and the rest &#8211; a pretty implausible
symbol of modern capitalism. Unlike them, the World Bank is
surrounded by an excellent army of NGO piranha fish, waiting to
pounce on its vitals with every error. Many people have argued,
because of its ineffectiveness, it should be abolished, and maybe it
will be &#8211; without anyone noticing.</p>

<p>If I am right about globalisation, it means the anti-globalisation
movement has its guns pointing in the wrong direction (although with
the second Gulf War the real enemies became clearer). The real
obstacles to progress are in the governments of the developed
countries who are not at all averse to turning people&#8217;s rage onto
the three international agencies, hiding their own decisive role
(with Clinton identifying with the Seattle anti-WTO demonstration,
Chirac with the anti-OECD demos). In this context Phil makes a very
important criticism of my book &#8211; that I failed to incorporate the
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In fact, the manuscript was in the
press during these events, but a more general point is absolutely
correct. The dominant states may not continue to allow, as they have
so far, the peaceful redistribution of the world economy (with the
dismantling of their old national economies). In a system dependent
on popular voting, stimulating increased popular nationalism &#8211; with
a real anti-globalisation movement, focused on hitting immigrants and
asylum-seekers &#8211; may be the dominant states&#8217; response to
declining economic leverage. Then politicians may seek by all means,
real and invented, to instil perpetual fear and insecurity in their
citizens, and a hatred of foreigners, spliced with periodic war
panics to rouse and cement support. In particular, the US, with its
unprecedented lead in military power, its terrified population and
new doctrines of unilateralism, has the capacity to seek to
substitute military and financial muscle for its declining economic
hold. If the newly emergent powers, China and India, do not concede,
then the next half century may see, not the development of the world,
but a determined stand to protect the old war-making state &#8211; with,
to rephrase Marx, &#8216;the common ruin of the contending states&#8217;.</p>

<p>The greatest impudence of the modern state was to insert in each
citizen&#8217;s mind a national identity that anchors loyalty to the
state in the psyche. Hitherto Marxists and others have barely had
significant success in weakening this, even though it is now
increasingly dysfunctional. The loyalty of Americans to Washington
could, in the coming period, spell disaster for us all.</p>
<p>At the end, I have my gravest doubts about Phil&#8217;s politics,
which seem to combine archaic theory, a kind of populist Marxism now
turned into faith, an absence of any connection with the current
system, and a bundle of moral postures (as a substitute for theory
and a way of indicating action), a position normally associated with
reformists. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a> Not that I expect to persuade readers of this
journal of my central theses and, after Phil&#8217;s comprehensive
rubbishing, no one is going to lash out on buying the book. But I am
grateful to him for giving me this opportunity to make some of my
points less opaque.</p>

on Mao&#8217;s China. Of what possible relevance would it be?</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f7" name="n7">7.</a> Which is appropriate when theory becomes mere faith. Phil
reproaches me for chiding Marx &#8211; when, I suppose, we should
restrict ourselves to genuflection and hosannas-without realising
that my entire book is an argument with Marx. And then, plaintively,
he laments, &#8216;Nowhere does he suggest an alternative to Marxism&#8217;
(p.&nbsp;136). Now, as a lifelong freethinker, I don&#8217;t feel at all
confident to advise on matters of faith &#8211; I could say Buddhism or
Catholicism or whatever, but it would be unreasonably frivolous. But
why does Phil not copy Marx, escape faith and start thinking?</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f10" name="n10">10.</a> I am reminded of an offhand remark by Michael Kidron in the
1960s that we could never move on to socialism until all the world&#8217;s
peasants had become workers. At the time, it seemed absurd, but half
a century later, it seems almost within our grasp.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f11" name="n11">11.</a> See A. Rose, <em>Do We Really Know That the WTO Increases
Trade?</em>, <strong>CEPR Discussion Paper</strong>.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f12" name="n12">12.</a> I am hurt that Phil doesn&#8217;t think I&#8217;m up to being
corrupted under my own steam, only through association with &#8211; to
use his language &#8211; an evil organisation like the bank. I&#8217;ve also
worked for the British government, which, unlike the bank, strafes
Iraqi women and children, which in my view is far more morally
objectionable. On a more humorous note, with my first temporary
consultancy with the bank in the 1970s, I mentioned it to Tony Cliff
who replied as I expected, with a grin, that he didn&#8217;t care a hoot
who I worked for &#8211; &#8216;After all, Engels was a capitalist and we
didn&#8217;t expel him&#8217;. Of course, Tony would never play the childish
politics of moral posturing, but perhaps Phil expects different moral
standards of non SWP members.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f13" name="n13">13.</a> If I&#8217;m right, it adds another twist to Tony Cliff&#8217;s
paradox, &#8216;The only good reformists are revolutionaries&#8217; &#8211; but
they also become reformists.</p>
