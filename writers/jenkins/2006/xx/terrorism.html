<p class="fst">&#8216;Terrorism&#8217; is the new global threat against which global war
must now be fought, according to ruling class politicians and the
media. Bin Laden and Al Qaida constitute for them an ubiquitous
presence against which the democratic values of civilisation are
ranged &#8211; a demon to be exorcised at all costs, even at the cost of
civil liberties.</p>

<p>This attitude affects sections of the left. Those who showed
sympathy to organisations (such as the Provisional IRA) using
&#8216;terrorist&#8217; methods in the 1970s now all too often take a
completely opposite view of today&#8217;s &#8216;terrorism&#8217;. The old
&#8216;terrorist&#8217; organisation, it seems, could be viewed positively
since their actions could be justified in the name of a secular,
progressive ideology, such as national liberation, anti-imperialism
or socialism. Today&#8217;s, by contrast, is seen as &#8216;Islamofascist&#8217;
or &#8216;reactionary anti-capitalist&#8217;, and therefore to be condemned
as no different from (and possibly worse than) the system it is
attacking.</p>

<p>But whatever the specific differences between terrorism currently
and that of the past &#8211; and these are less than appearances suggest
&#8211; the question of how to respond is one that socialists have
frequently had to confront.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The marxist tradition</h4>

<p class="fst">Both Marx and Engels, on different occasions, had to respond to
the kind of strategy that emphasised not mass action but actions
carried out by individuals (such as blowing up buildings or
assassinating hated individuals) &#8211; what came to be known as
&#8216;terrorism&#8217; in the latter half of the 19th century. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p>The first occasion was with the Fenians, or Irish Republican
Brotherhood, a revolutionary secret society dedicated to the
emancipation of Ireland. In September 1867 local Fenians in
Manchester blew open the locked door of a Black Maria in which the
two arrested leaders of the organisation were being taken to court. A
police sergeant died in the explosion. Four of the rescuers were
arrested, together with a totally innocent fifth man picked up in a
raid in Manchester&#8217;s Irish district, and were charged with murder
and sentenced to death. Three were hanged on 23 November, despite the
fact that none of the accused had fired a fatal shot and the death
had been accidental. The savagery of the British government&#8217;s
reaction to the incident led to huge demonstrations of support for
the cause of Irish independence &#8211; from English workers as well as
Irish people. However, within a couple of weeks another attempt by
Fenians to rescue a leader went badly awry. The explosives used to
release a Fenian organiser from Clerkenwell prison in London caused a
neighbouring row of houses to collapse, killing seven of the
inhabitants and seriously injuring another 120.</p>

<p>What was the reaction of Marx and Engels? Marx had thrown his
energies into getting the International to support the demand for
Irish independence, convinced that unless the power of the English
landlords was weakened working class revolution in England would not
be possible. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> So it was in the interests of English workers to
support the resistance of the Irish. Marx wrote to Engels on 2
November, &#8216;I have sought in every way to provoke this manifestation
of the English workers in support of Fenianism&#8217;. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> In a letter to
Engels on 7 November he said, &#8216;This business stirs the feelings of
the intelligent part of the working class here&#8217;. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> Engels echoed
this sentiment in a letter to Kugelmann in Germany: &#8216;The London
proletarians declare every day more openly for the Fenians and hence
&#8211; an unheard-of and splendid thing here &#8211; for, first, a violent
and, secondly, an anti-English movement&#8217;. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p>Not all progressive opinion was prepared to back the Fenians. The
Reform League, an organisation set up in 1865 to agitate for
universal suffrage, and on which leading trade union members of the
International sat, passed a resolution condemning Fenianism. This put
pressure on the International itself, and it took all Marx&#8217;s
efforts to ensure that the International maintained a hard position.
The Clerkenwell explosion clearly did not help matters. Marx wrote
furiously to Engels the day after:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The last exploit of the Fenians in Clerkenwell was a very
stupid thing. The London masses, who have shown great sympathy for
Ireland, will be made wild by it and be driven into the arms of the
of the government party. One cannot expect the London proletarians to
allow themselves to be blown up in honour of the Fenian emissaries.
There is always a kind of fatality about such a secret, melodramatic
sort of conspiracy. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A few days later Engels replied, saying, &#8216;The stupid affair in
Clerkenwell was obviously the work of a few specialised fanatics; it
is the misfortune of all conspiracies that they lead to such
stupidities, because &#8220;after all something must happen, after all
something must be done&#8221;.&#8217; <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p>Even before the Clerkenwell outrage, Engels had agreed with Marx
that &#8216;the beastliness of the English must not make us forget that
the leaders of this sect are mostly asses and partly exploiters, and
we cannot in any way make ourselves responsible for the stupidities
which occur in every conspiracy. And they are certain to happen&#8217;.
<a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> But none of this lessened their public championing of the cause
for which the Fenians fought.</p>

<p>So support for Fenianism, as an expression of national struggle,
was tempered with clarity about the nature of the movement&#8217;s
leadership (its class composition) and the weakness of its tactics
(the reliance on conspiratorial means). What we see here, in
embryonic form, are two aspects of the Marxist tradition. One is an
understanding that socialists do not put conditions on their support
for movements of national resistance to imperialist oppression. The
second is an understanding of the limitations of such movements &#8211;
the idea that a select few can produce change through conspiratorial
methods inevitably isolates them from the mass of the population and
dooms them ultimately to failure. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> The question is not whether
socialists stand aside because they perceive these limitations. It is
rather that they build support on class terms &#8211; as Marx, through
the First International, was able to do, even as Fenianism declined.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Individual terrorism in Russia</h4>

<p class="fst">The deaths at Clerkenwell were accidental &#8211; the Fenians had not
intended to kill people, though such accidents are the likely
consequence of conspiratorial methods. The deliberate targeting of
individuals, &#8216;terrorism&#8217; in the modern sense of the term, did
become the method used by some anarchists and by a section of Russian
revolutionaries (the Narodniks and their successors) in the period
from the late 1870s through to the early 20th century. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>In Russia <em>Narodnaya Volya</em> (the People&#8217;s Will
organisation) carried out a series of actions targeting highly placed
government officials, culminating in the assassination of Tsar
Alexander II in 1881. The Narodniks&#8217; turn to terrorism was a
response to the failure of the earlier attempt to &#8216;go to the
people&#8217; and stir the peasantry into overthrowing Tsarism &#8211; an
attempt that had led to savage repression by the autocracy. Only
terror, they now believed, would undermine the people&#8217;s confiden in
the government and therefore increase their receptivity to its
overthrow. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> When Vera Zasulich was tried for the attempted
assassination of the brutal governor of Moscow in 1878, such was the
hatred for the victim and sympathy for the perpetrator that the jury
acquitted her. Only a complete reactionary would have criticised her
for the &#8216;immorality&#8217; of trying to kill a hated member of the
ruling class. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> Marx himself refused to condemn this kind of
violence. After the assassination of Alexander II he wrote to his
daughter Jenny that terror was &#8216;a historically inevitable means of
action of which it was as useless to discuss as that of the
earthquake at Chios&#8217;, and he admired the Russian terrorists as
&#8216;excellent people through and through ... simple, straightforward,
heroic&#8217;. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p>His admiration was not some contradictory admiration for what he
had condemned in Fenian conspiratorial politics. Russia, unlike
England, had arrived at such a point of disintegration that it was
&#8216;undoubtedly on the eve of a revolution&#8217;. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> In this context
the emergence of a revolutionary current dedicated to helping the
tottering state collapse, whatever the means, could not impede the
process. In England, on the other hand, the choice of means made a
difference. Fenian conspiracies might damage the goal of an
independent Ireland by hindering the process of developing the
consciousness of English workers.</p>

<p>At the same time the question of what social force in Russian
society could shape the future was thrown into relief by the
Narodniks&#8217; activities. The rationale behind the tactics of first
&#8216;going to the people&#8217; and then turning to terrorism was their
belief that the archaic peasant form of common ownership (the
obshchina) could become the basis of a higher form of society, thus
enabling Russia to bypass capitalism altogether. But with the failure
of both tactics, some Narodniks began to question this belief &#8211; and
the centrality of the peasantry. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p>One of those people was Vera Zasulich herself. She, among others,
came to look to the social force that capitalism created in the late
1880s and 1890s, the new working class. And in particular Lenin, who
did most to apply Marxist ideas to Russian conditions, developed an
analysis that not only rejected Narodnik views of social development
but their terrorist methods. This did not involve a rejection of
revolution (Lenin&#8217;s critique was not based on waiting for
capitalism to mature). It was, rather, a criticism of the
effectiveness of terrorism as a revolutionary method now that
capitalism in Russia was developing a working class capable of
self-organisation in its own defence. Tight revolutionary
organisation was as important for Lenin as it had been for the
Narodniks. But where, for Lenin, revolutionary organisation was
central to the self-organisation of the working class, for the
Narodniks it was a substitute for popular self-activity. This was a
consequence of their politics &#8211; the failure to &#8216;inspire&#8217; the
peasants by propaganda had led the Narodniks to the conclusion that
terror, committed by themselves in the name of a class that did not
act for itself, could serve as a short cut to revolution. Their
desperate impatience was a tragic mistake, as isolation only made it
easier for the authorities to harass and infiltrate the Narodniks &#8211;
even to carry out terroristic acts themselves. Terror became a
self-defeating strategy. For Lenin, on the contrary, the
interventionist element of revolutionary politics was to be rooted in
the self-activity of the working class.</p>

<p>Lenin combined a high degree of respect for the revolutionary
traditions of Narodism with a sharp critique of its method and
programme. Thus, writing in 1899, he maintained that Russian
revolutionary Marxism &#8216;carries on the cause and the traditions of
the whole preceding revolutionary movement in Russia&#8217; and &#8216;marches
towards the goal that was already indicated by the glorious
representatives of the old <em>Narodnaya Volya</em>&#8217;. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> He
immediately qualified this by adding that the difference between the
two was that the heroism of the Narodniks rested on too narrow a
social base and an inadequate theoretical understanding of social
developments. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a> But what might have been a forgivable error, in
view of the repressive political conditions and undeveloped social
forces of the period of the late 1870s and early 1880s (the period of
<em>Narodnaya Volya</em>), was no longer so at the turn of the century,
when the working class movement had made enormous strides forward.</p>

<p>The argument became particularly important with a new wave of
&#8216;terrorist&#8217; actions carried out by the Social Revolutionaries
(the political descendants of <em>Narodnya Volya</em>). It started with
an assassination of a government minister in 1902 and reached its
peak with some 82 assassinations in 1907, before rapidly tailing off.
The most notorious assassination was of Plehve, the minister of the
interior, in 1904. One of the perpetrators, Azef, was exposed as a
police agent in 1909.</p>

<p>Lenin, writing in 1902, was altogether harder than he had been
with the Narodniks. These were, he claimed, &#8216;stormy times&#8217; after
a long period of tranquillity, and had stirred up sections of the
intelligentsia, &#8216;caught up in the maelstrom of events and who have
neither theoretical principles nor social roots&#8217;. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a> On the face
of it, the Social Revolutionaries&#8217; advocacy of &#8216;terrorism, not in
place of work among the masses, but precisely for and simultaneously
with that work&#8217; <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> seemed to acknowledge the primacy of the
working class. But this acknowledgement masked a move away from class
politics, just as much as the swing to reformism by sections of the
left. For Lenin terrorism reflected &#8216;an utter failure to understand
the mass movement and a lack of faith in it&#8217;. It revealed &#8216;the
inefficacy of terrorism, for without the working class all bombs are
powerless, patently powerless&#8217;. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a> Even more stupid, according to
Lenin, was the justification for terrorism. The Social
Revolutionaries claimed that neither the &#8216;crowd&#8217; (ie the masses)
nor revolutionary organisations were safe from the repressive might
of the state. Only &#8216;individuals or small groups that are
ceaselessly, and even in ignorance of one another, preparing for
attack, and are attacking&#8217; have the &#8216;elusiveness&#8217; <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a> that
makes them immune. This, for Lenin, was a complete inversion of the
obvious truth that &#8216;the only &#8220;hope&#8221; of the revolution is the
&#8220;crowd&#8221;&#8217; and its revolutionary leadership. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a> Lenin was
equally scathing about the claims made by Social Revolutionaries that
heroic single combat excites a spirit of struggle in us all. On the
contrary, he argued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Only new forms of the mass movement or the awakening of
new sections of the masses to independent struggle really rouses a
spirit of struggle and courage in all. Single combat, however,
inasmuch as it remains single combat, has the immediate effect of
simply creating a shortlived sensation, while indirectly it even
leads to apathy and passive waiting for the next bout. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin made one other point about this type of terrorism &#8211; which
was to argue that the &#8216;present day terrorists are really
&#8220;economists&#8221; [i.e. those who restricted the movement to reform
using trade union methods] turned inside out&#8217;. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> In putting
terrorists and reformists in the same basket, he did not mean, of
course, that their methods were the same. He meant, rather, that both
tendencies evaded the central role of how workers themselves would
change society and how political organisation related to that. One
tendency substituted terror for mass work, the other reform for
revolution. One looked to the intelligentsia as the agent of
political change, the other to the liberal bourgeoisie to lead the
struggle against Tsarism. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a> The relevance of this point today is
that parliamentary reform is not the alternative to terrorism when it
comes to changing society &#8211; neither looks to working class
self-activity as the lever for revolutionary change. In that sense, a
reformist and a terrorist approach, for all their differences, share
the same limitations.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&#8216;Propaganda of the deed&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">The use of &#8216;terrorist&#8217; methods was not confined to Russia. An
anarchist concept of &#8216;propaganda of the deed&#8217; inspired a wave of
assassinations (and attempted assassinations) of high-ranking
government figures, mostly in Western Europe. The high point was a
series of spectacular terrorist attacks in France, which culminated
in the assassination of President Sadi-Carnot in 1894.</p>

<p>Capitalist development had produced not just a working class. Its
victims in the great cities included a mass of d&#233;class&#233;
individuals, whose hatred of capitalism expressed itself in forms of
individual revolt. In France the defeat of the Paris Commune of 1871
cast a long, demoralising shadow over working class politics. The
Third Republic itself was the corrupt plaything of politicians
jockeying for office, which even the socialists were seeking
representation in. &#8216;Propaganda of the deed&#8217; offered a solution,
alongside which socialist arguments about the working masses seemed
unexciting. Settling scores with hated ruling class figures seemed
better than talking about collective answers to the system. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a> But
this impatient desire to force the pace of history was elitist in its
effects. It opened the way to a terrorism much more indiscriminate in
its targets than the older Narodnik terrorism.</p>

<p>Some, but by no means all, terrorism was directed at ruling class
institutions or representatives. Thus in 1886 Charles Gallo hurled
sulphuric acid into the Paris stock exchange and then fired three
random revolver shots. No one was hurt and Gallo used his trial, at
which he was sentenced to 20 years hard labour, to give an hour and a
half lecture on anarchism. He had intended, he stated, to carry out
&#8216;an act of propaganda by the deed for anarchist doctrine&#8217;. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a>
Even more spectacularly in 1893, Auguste Vaillant threw a bomb into
the French parliament, which produced a lot of damage but no loss of
life. The perpetrator this time was executed, his last words being,
&#8216;<em>Vive l&#8217;anarchie!</em> My death will be avenged&#8217; &#8211; which it
was six months later with the assassination of the French president. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p>But other terrorist attacks were less discriminating in their
targets. A week after Vaillant&#8217;s execution, Emile Henry, the 18-year-old son of a Communard, threw a bomb into the crowded station cafe at the Gare St Lazare in Paris. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a> Many were wounded and one died later of his wounds. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a> At his trial, Henry was asked why he
had attacked innocent people. His reply, which became notorious, was
that &#8216;there are no innocents&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I was convinced that the existing organisation was bad. I
wanted to struggle against it so to hasten its disappearance. I
brought to the struggle a profound hatred, intensified every day by
the revolting spectacle of a society where all is base, all is
cowardly, where everything is a barrier to the development of human
passions, to the generous tendencies of the heart, to the free flight
of thought. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a></p>

<p class="fst">His justification for not sparing innocents, he went on to say,
was that anarchists:</p>

<p class="quoteb">... do not spare bourgeois women and children, because
the wives and the children of those they [the anarchists] love are
not spared either. Are not those children innocent victims who, in
the slums, die slowly of anaemia because bread is scarce at home? Or
those women who grow pale in your workshops and wear themselves out
to earn 40 sous a day? <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Henry&#8217;s one regret was that there had not been more victims <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a>
&#8211; which followed from the false proposition that the failure to
rouse the masses was the consequence of not having produced a big
enough shock.</p>

<p>Henry&#8217;s action caused revulsion. However, that was not true of
anarchist attacks whose targets were the rich and powerful or the
institutions of bourgeois society, for which there was much greater
sympathy. Terrorism became &#8216;popular&#8217; <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a> &#8211; not least because
the French ruling class reacted so viciously (even executing those
who had not caused loss of life), and because it seemed that someone
was taking revenge on bourgeois society for its crimes. One
terrorist, Ravachol, who bombed two apartment blocks in 1892 in
retaliation for sentences meted out to May Day demonstrators, was
compared by one artist to Christ, gave his name to a new verb
(<em>ravacholiser</em> &#8211; to blow up), and had a song praising
dynamite composed in his honour. The reason for such &#8216;popularity&#8217;
is not difficult to discover. Terrorists may have an elitist disdain
for mass action and attempt to substitute themselves for the masses.
But the masses themselves, in the absence of self-confidence and
self-organisation, may secretly or openly admire those who appear to
be able to do what they themselves can only dream of &#8211; take revenge
for their humiliation.</p>

<p>The wave of &#8216;terrorist&#8217; attacks was a test for the relatively
young and inexperienced French socialist movement of the day. It had
made a breakthrough in electoral terms by the early 1890s, and a
coalition of socialists now had a significant parliamentary presence.
But how would they react to the way in which the French government
used the bombing of parliament and the assassination of President
Sadi-Carnot to rush through laws that clamped down on freedom of
expression and civil liberties &#8211; and served as a useful diversion
from the festering financial crisis around the Panama Canal? Engels
wrote to Marx&#8217;s son-in-law Paul Lafargue that these &#8216;infamous
laws&#8217; would be used more against the socialists than the anarchists
<a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a>, but that &#8216;you will defeat it and you will emerge from the
struggles infinitely stronger than you went into it&#8217;. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p>Jules Guesde, a leader of the supposedly most revolutionary of the
socialist currents, denounced anarchist violence and declared that
&#8216;socialism will succeed only by the peacefully expressed will of
the people&#8217;. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a> The socialists&#8217; best parliamentary orator, Jean
Jaur&#232;s, responded in a way that made fewer concessions to prevailing
ideas, despite his recent origins in non-socialist radicalism. He
sympathised with what had motivated terrorists like Ravachol and
Vaillant. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a> He went onto the offensive in parliament by focusing
on the government&#8217;s multiple &#8216;searches and arrests among the
poor&#8217;, its moves to control political activity in the working class
movement, its use of <em>agents provocateurs</em>, its prohibition of
the discussion of &#8216;anarchist ideas&#8217;, and its introduction of
special and secret &#8216;correctional tribunals&#8217; to replace jury
trials. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a> Jaur&#232;s also tried to introduce legislation to reform
taxation as a way of pinpointing where the real problem lay &#8211; with
&#8216;the tyranny of capitalism&#8217;. The socialist parliamentary bloc was
only a minority, and stood no chance of defeating the &#8216;infamous
laws&#8217;. But their forthright opposition shifted the spotlight away
from anarchist outrages, exposed the corrupt and undemocratic reality
of the system, and shook the government to its core. At the climax of
the debate, Jaur&#232;s denounced &#8216;all men in public life who have sold
their votes or been involved in financial scandal&#8217;. They, he said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">... will be judged as the real cause of anarchist
propaganda ... When the same barque carries the corrupt politician
and the murdering anarchist into hell, they will find much to talk
about, for they will be the complementary products of the same social
order. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus Jaur&#232;s was able to stand against anarchist terrorism but not
concede an inch to the system against which it fought.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Trotsky&#8217;s polemic against individual terrorism</h4>

<p class="fst">Leon Trotsky&#8217;s wrote two critiques of individual terrorism &#8211;
the first written in 1909, in response to the unmasking of the
assassin of Plehve as a police agent, and the second in 1911, in
response to terrorist moods in the Austrian working class. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a> They
sum up the accumulated wisdom of the Marxist tradition on the
question but need some contextualising.</p>

<p>In the first article Trotsky starts by explaining that the
systematic terror used by the Russian Narodniks stemmed from the way
in which the Tsarist state, built up by using European capital and
technology rather than native resources, appeared to stand above
society. It appeared to be &#8216;a purely external organ of coercion,
having no roots in the social organisation itself ... elevating
itself above all classes of society&#8217; <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a>, including even the
privileged classes who were denied the opportunity to develop the
state along &#8216;normal&#8217; (bourgeois democratic) lines. This also
affected the Europeanised representatives of Russian intellectual
life, the intelligentsia. The state&#8217;s social isolation and lack of
roots gave rise to the illusion (rapidly shattered) that no real
social forces were needed to destroy Tsarism. Explosives in the hands
of a dedicated few would be sufficient to wipe out this external
organ of coercion. But what had been a heroic illusion in a period of
undeveloped social forces had now been overtaken by the development
of real social forces &#8211; the working class and its political
self-organisation. However much the Social Revolutionaries might try
to hang on to terrorist methods by talking about them as alongside,
instead of in place of, mass struggle, they are incompatible methods:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Engendered by the absence of a revolutionary class,
regenerated later by a lack of confidence in the revolutionary
masses, terrorism can maintain itself only by exploiting the weakness
and disorganisation of the masses, minimising their conquests and
exaggerating their defeats. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p class="fst">And precisely because it substitutes secretive, conspiratorial
organisation for the kind of organisation that looks to mass action,
it is open to police infiltration.</p>

<p>In the later article, Trotsky develops this argument to take in
non-Russian conditions. He starts by dealing with the accusation
directed at revolutionary socialists that they use violence
(terrorism) to achieve their ends. Trotsky&#8217;s defence is not to deny
the role of violence, but to point out that for the capitalist class
to condemn strikers for being &#8216;violent&#8217; over picketing or dealing
with scabs is sheer hypocrisy, compared with the violence of the
capitalist state machine (the law, the police and the armed forces).
Indeed, if they want to say that &#8216;inspiring fear or doing harm&#8217;
to the class enemy is terrorism, than &#8216;the entire class struggle is
nothing but terrorism&#8217;. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p>This is followed by a sharp condemnation of terrorism in the much
narrower sense of the term, of which assassination of government
ministers (the classic form of individual terrorism) or of employers
is only one example. Trotsky includes machine breaking and factory
arson as examples of terrorism &#8211; which may appear surprising, since
neither is specifically directed at individuals. His point, however,
is the class motivation for such targets &#8211; whether persons or
property &#8211; has nothing specifically proletarian about it, and
therefore will not strengthen the collective confidence or
organisation of the working class, as strike action can. Trotsky&#8217;s
repeated emphasis on the importance of the role of strike action
needs further comment. He does not confine it to the question of
&#8216;economics&#8217; &#8211; he relates it to politics, including
parliamentary politics. Given its position at the heart of capitalist
production, the working class can only advance its interests
collectively. Methods that rely on individual &#8216;terror&#8217; cannot,
and indeed may produce confusion &#8211; if the ruling class can be
defeated by shooting its representative, what is the point of the
class struggle? Hence Trotsky&#8217;s conclusion:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In our eyes, individual terror is inadmissible precisely
because it <em>belittles the role of the masses</em> in their own
consciousness, reconciles them to their powerlessness, and turns
their eyes and hopes toward a great avenger and liberator who some
day will come and accomplish his mission. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Therefore &#8216;propaganda of the deed&#8217; has the opposite effect to
that claimed for it by the anarchists. It does not arouse the masses.
Instead, it focuses attention away from self-organisation onto the
&#8216;terrorists&#8217;. A new minister replaces the old one, the daily
grind of exploitation resumes. The only change is increased police
oppression. This is as true of life after 9/11 and 7/7 as it was in
Trotsky&#8217;s day.</p>

<p>But we have to be careful how we use Trotsky&#8217;s argument.
Sometimes the condemnation of terrorism implies that but for the
terrorists the conditions for progress would be favourable &#8211; the
state would have no excuse to attack us. This is to make the
terrorists as big a problem as the system they hope to weaken. It is
as if capitalism were not always seeking to restrict our sphere of
action, and as if the working class movement did not have the
strength to recover from any temporary setback. As Trotsky put it,
&#8216;Capitalist society needs an active, mobile, and intelligent
proletariat &#8211; it cannot, therefore, bind the proletariat hand and
foot for very long&#8217;. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a> A one-sided use of Trotsky&#8217;s polemic
can reproduce the very pessimism that Trotsky denounced in individual terrorism.<br/>

<h4>Socialists in Britain and the IRA</h4>

<p class="fst">In the early 1970s repression by British forces in the North of
Ireland led to a bombing campaign by Republicans. The IRA had wide,
if passive, support in the Catholic community, because it was seen as
their defender from both the British army and the Orange Order. There
could be no question of joining in the chorus of hatred from the
British media and politicians. But what, then, should the attitude of
socialists be? Some, notably the Militant Tendency (forerunners of
the Socialist Party), argued that only class politics could solve the
national question that still existed as a result of partition. While
abstractly true, this evaded the question of whether socialists
should support the national struggle. Others in effect argued that
one had to take sides in a civil war &#8211; planting bombs in pubs,
shops, factories and the like were legitimate tactics in the military
fight against the occupying British forces.</p>

<p>The International Socialists (forerunners of the SWP) recognised
that there were elements of a civil war in the North of Ireland, but
concluded that the limitations of Republicanism required socialists
to raise criticism within the context of overall support for the
national struggle. <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> argued in an editorial on
12 February 1972:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Unconditional but critical support for all those,
including both IRAs, fighting imperialism. By unconditional we mean
support regardless of our criticism of the leadership and tactics. By
critical we mean opposing the sowing of illusions that the struggle
can finally be won except by the victory of the working class
fighting on a programme of social as well as national liberation. <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In particular, Nationalist politics (and tactics based purely on
defence of the minority Catholic community) would not appeal to
Protestant workers or break the hold that Tory Orangeism had on them.
That could only happen if there was a sizeable working class
organisation that demonstrated as great a hostility to the Green
Tories in the South as it did to the Orange Tories in the North. In
practice, the nationalist politics of the IRA meant that it could not
do this. Therefore, despite unconditional support for the Republican
movement because its defence of the Catholic minority challenged the
power of the British state, there had to be criticism. To subordinate
class to nation was to fail to see that Green bosses (both North and
South) were as much the enemy as the Orange bosses, and to fail to
see Protestant workers as part of the solution. Indeed, unless
anti-imperialism moved beyond a politics based purely on nationalism,
unless it found a way to class politics, it could not even solve the
national struggle. Duncan Hallas and Jim Higgins, two leading
members, defended the <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> editorial in an
internal bulletin, writing:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The line of our organisation &#8211; which is the application
of the theory of permanent revolution in Ireland &#8211; is that the
overthrow of imperialism in Ireland (North or South) is impossible
except on the basis of a mass movement with a revolutionary socialist
leadership ... The defence of the Catholic community against
governmental terrorism helps this development by challenging the
power of the state and thus raising the possibility of its
destruction ... The bombing campaign hinders the development by
strengthening the ties of the Orange workers to Stormont. And it
deflects the Catholic working class militants by giving them a false
perspective and activity. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This argument rested on an analysis that saw that British
imperialism could not be defeated simply on the basis of a struggle
waged by the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland (one third of one
quarter of the population of the island as a whole). It had to gain
active support from elsewhere &#8211; from the working class of the Irish
Republic and from at least a section of Protestant workers in
Northern Ireland &#8211; and some degree of sympathy from workers in
Britain. The bombing campaign made this more difficult. The bombs
inevitably had the unintended effect of killing innocent bystanders,
enabling the ruling class to isolate the Republicans in the South and
to frighten people of Irish descent in Britain away from active
support for the struggle &#8211; so that the very big demonstrations
London saw in the late 1960s and early 1970s were not replicated in
the 1980s and 1990s. The correctness of our arguments is to be seen
today, with the abandonment of the armed struggle by the IRA and the
willingness of the Republican leadership to participate in the
institutions of the still-partitioned North.</p>

<p>Against this background, <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> year after year
carried a double argument. Its main component was that the &#8216;Troubles&#8217;
in Northern Ireland &#8211; and their by-product, the bombings in Britain
&#8211; were a consequence of the British presence, the latest stage in
the centuries-old imperialist domination of Ireland. For this reason,
resistance to the British troops was quite legitimate. But it was
also necessary to make it clear that the bombings were not a way to
defeat imperialism and had therefore to be criticised.</p>
<p>An important example was provided after a bomb planted in a pub in
Birmingham in November 1974 killed 19 workers and injured some 200
other people. Hysteria swept though the city, whipped up by the
media, creating a climate in which any Irish immigrant was subject to
at least verbal abuse, and in which six totally innocent workers were
sentenced to life imprisonment &#8211; serving 16 years before being
freed. <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>&#8217;s response to bombing was a
three-tiered headline: &#8216;Stop the Bombings. Fight Repression in
Britain and in Ireland. Troops Out of Ireland.&#8217;</p>

<p>The front page spelt it out:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The root cause of the bombings is the repression in
Northern Ireland. Internment without trial, sectarian murders by
unchallenged Protestant gangs, bullying searches and killings by the
British army have driven the minority to despair. Senseless planting
of bombs seems to some of them the only way out. Repression does not
cancel out the terrorism bred by repression. Both increase together.</p>

<p class="quote">Workers&#8217; anger in Birmingham in the past week has shown
that there are not enough socialists organised in the factories to
fight back powerfully enough against anti-Irish opinion, to argue
that the militancy of the British working class should be used to
strike at the root of the Irish troubles ... The British government
and its army ... bear the responsibility for 400 years of Irish
misery.</p>

<p class="fst">An article on the second page of the paper went through the
history of British rule in Ireland, and the way a peaceful movement
for civil rights in 1968&#8211;69 had been attacked by the full might of
the state: &#8216;The way the people of Birmingham felt last Friday is
how the Northern Ireland Catholic community have been feeling every
day for the last five years.&#8217; The editorial concluded:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We have always made it clear that socialists in Britain
have to defend the right of Irish people to struggle to throw the
British troops out of Ireland. That includes the right of Republicans
to organise to fight against these troops ... The planting of bombs
in places frequented by ordinary workers cannot contribute to the
defence of the Catholic areas or the driving out of British troops
... that is why we condemn the bombings ... But we have to continue
to insist that the precondition for a solution to Ireland&#8217;s
problems is the withdrawal of British troops. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Today&#8217;s Islamist terrorists</h4>

<p class="fst">The media and much of the left would have us believe that today&#8217;s
Islamist terrorists are qualitatively worse than any in the past.
Even the Irish Republicans &#8211; whose very voices were banned from the
airwaves just a dozen years ago &#8211; are now presented as rational
compared to them. What dominates is the image of the suicide bomber
as a crazed Islamic fanatic.</p>

<p>But there is nothing specifically Islamist about the methods of
the suicide bomb. The leading practitioners of suicide attacks as a
weapon do not come from the Middle East, nor are they Muslims. They
are the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, whose ideology is not religious
but &#8216;Marxist-Leninist&#8217; <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a> (though their cultural background is
Hindu), and whose aim is the secular goal of national liberation.
Robert Pape, who has closely analysed suicide attacks between 1980
and 2003, reckons they are responsible for the biggest single group
of attacks &#8211; some 76 out of a total of 315. This is more than the
number committed by the Palestinian group Hamas. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a> And not all
suicide bombers from &#8216;Islamic&#8217; groups are Muslims. Hezbollah,
which emerged in Lebanon in the 1980s, was the first modern movement
to use the method (they forced US troops to withdraw after 241
Marines were killed in a single attack). Of the 41 suicide terrorists
involved in attacks between 1982 and 1986, only three were Islamic
fundamentalists. The rest were overwhelmingly Communists or
socialists &#8211; and three were Christians! <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a></p>

<p>Suicide bombing campaigns may be couched in Islamic terms. That
does not mean that religious fundamentalism explains their goals.
Pape concludes from the data of his survey:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There is not the close connection between suicide
terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism that many people think. Rather,
what all suicide terrorist campaigns have in common is a specific
secular and strategic goal &#8211; to compel democracies to withdraw
forces from the terrorists&#8217; national homeland. Religion is rarely
the root cause, although it is often used as a tool by terrorist
organisations in recruiting and in other efforts in service of the
broader strategic objective. <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This assessment is backed by an analysis of Al Qaida from another
source. The organisation is usually taken as the epitome of Islamic
fundamentalism &#8211; the group most bent on declaring a religious war
on the West, against modernity and secularism. But the question that
Stephen Holmes rightly raises is whether religious belief causes an
action (such as the bombing of the twin towers) or whether the action
may be motivated by another cause but be expressed in religious form:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Does Osama Bin Laden want to eject the United States from
Saudi Arabia because its troops were desecrating sacred soil, or is
he aggrieved, like any anti-colonialist or nationalist insurgent,
that the United States is plundering his country&#8217;s national
resources? Does Ayman al-Zawahiri, the physician who founded Egyptian
Islamic Jihad and who is usually considered Bin Laden&#8217;s closest
associate, want to overthrow Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak because
the latter is an apostate or because he is a tyrant? <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Difficult though it may be to disentangle the religious from the
non-religious, Holmes&#8217;s conclusion about the nature of Al Qaida&#8217;s
&#8216;war&#8217; on the US is substantially the same at Pape&#8217;s:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The vast majority of Bin Laden&#8217;s public statements
provide secular, not religious, rationales for 9/11. The principal
purpose of the attack was to punish the &#8216;unjust and tyrannical
America&#8217;. The casus belli he invokes over and over again is
injustice not impiety. True, he occasionally remarks that the United
States has declared war on god, but such statements would carry
little conviction if not seconded by claims that the United States is
tyrannising and exploiting Muslim people ... Bin Laden almost never
justifies terrorism against the West as a means for subordinating
Western unbelievers to the true faith. Instead, he almost always
justifies terrorism against the West as a form of legitimate
self-defence. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In other words, the goal of Al Qaida is no different from other
national liberation movements &#8211; to achieve independence by forcing
the imperialist power to retreat. It may express itself in religious
terms, but in essence it pursues the same aim as previous
secular-nationalist movements in the Middle East &#8211; the defeat of US
imperialism and its allies in the region. <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>

<p>It is a mistake to think of the strategy of suicide bombing as
betraying an irrationalism that derives from Islamic fundamentalism.
There is a rationale for the adoption of this strategy that stems
from the problem of defeating an enemy in conditions of extreme
inequality of resources. The oppressor possesses a military might
unimaginably greater than anything the oppressed have at their
disposal. The oppressed cannot hope to inflict on the enemy the kind
of material damage that will force the oppressor to back off. All
they can hope to do is inflict psychological damage that comes from
showing that the oppressed will stop at nothing &#8211; not even
self-sacrifice &#8211; to terrorise the oppressor country. As Pape puts
it, &#8216;Suicide terrorism attempts to inflict pain on the opposing
society ... and so induce the government to concede, or the
population to revolt against the government&#8217;. <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a></p>

<p>This is a &#8216;strategy for weak actors&#8217; who lack the &#8216;normal&#8217;
military means for fighting. Suicide bombing may be a dirty, inhumane
way of fighting (because it targets civilians). However, it derives
from not being able to compete with the violence that the oppressor
can dish out supposedly &#8216;cleanly&#8217; (through high-tech operations)
but which is much more extensive and devastating than anything a
suicide bomber can inflict. The hope, too, is that the preparedness
to use one&#8217;s body as a self-sacrificial killing machine will
inspire the oppressed to give their support to the struggle.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to think that suicide bombers are psychologically
driven by Islamic fanaticism. Rather, what motivates them to action
is rage at material conditions of oppression and exploitation &#8211;
which is then expressed by commitment to a religious outlook and way
of behaving. Bombers are not some alien &#8216;other&#8217; &#8211; they are just
like us, or rather just like anyone else who is moved to anger by
inequality, poverty and injustice. This is what we know of the
background of one of the 9/11 hijackers, Mohammed Atta:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The grievances he loudly and frequently articulated
against the United States and the Muslim autocracies that the United
States supports were almost entirely secular. Most of those who knew
him before 1996 stress not Atta&#8217;s religious piety ... but his
implacable fury at the plight of the poor and the indifference of the
rich ... He was bitterly angry at the visible juxtaposition, in
Cairo, of extravagant and frivolous luxury with mass squalor and
hopelessness. Egypt&#8217;s elite, in particular, was hypocritical, he
believed. They showed a &#8216;democratic face&#8217; to the West, while
displaying complete indifference to the misery of ordinary people at
home. They had sold their country to the West for trinkets. <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Just as Henry, the French bomber of the caf&#233; at the Gare St
Lazare more than a century ago, saw bourgeois women and children as
&#8216;guilty&#8217; by association, so there are people suffering from
imperialism across the world (and not just Muslims) who see the
ordinary inhabitants of the oppressor nation as equally &#8216;guilty&#8217;
by association with what &#8216;their&#8217; nation is doing. This is a
terrible inversion of the argument that says that because Bush and
Blair were elected their actions in unleashing war are legitimate.
The terrorist logic is that the population cannot be &#8216;innocent&#8217;
because they voted for Bush and Blair.</p>

<p>This is the politics of despair. It is also the consequence of
seeing the fight against injustice in non-class terms. It is the same
logic that led sections of Irish Nationalists to see ordinary British
people as part of the problem. David O&#8217;Connell, one of the
militaristic leaders of the Republicans in the mid-1970s (before they
were displaced by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuiness), argued after the
Birmingham bombings:</p>

<p class="quoteb">For five years, the British government has been waging a
campaign of terror ... against the people of Ireland. What have we
got from the British public? Total indifference. The British
government and the British public must realise that they will suffer
the consequences. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Apart from the lack of religious language, it is exactly the same
argument that those who back Al Qaida resort to today. <strong>Socialist
Worker</strong>&#8217;s comment at the time still applies:</p>

<p class="quoteb">This conclusion must be opposed by every socialist. It
equates the rulers ... with the people. Our whole argument rests upon
the fact that society is divided into classes with opposed interests. <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Just as applicable is this analysis of the politics of an
organisation that embraces such a logic:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It is not, as the press and right wing politicians
pretend, made up of bloodthirsty maniacs &#8211; after all, it is the
right wing press and politicians who have always supported the
bombing by British armed forces of innocent civilians anywhere in the
world ... The real point ... is that its leaders see the real
division in the world as that between nations, not between classes
... like middle class politicians everywhere. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is just such a logic that thinks only a tiny group of dedicated
fighters can avenge the wrongs in society, that the mass of people is
either corrupt or incapable of stirring into action &#8211; unless
&#8216;exemplary&#8217; action is taken by these dedicated fighters. And
because this is the politics of despair, the greater the impotence of
those caught in this spiral, the bigger the dream of destruction &#8211;
the better to make an impact.</p>

<p>Suicide bombings are not some barbaric throwback to pre-modernity.
They are a horribly distorted response to the very real horrors of
imperialism and capitalism. The scale and reach of some present-day
attacks is greater than any terrorist organisation has been able to
carry out in the past. But the devastation and death toll are is
still on a massively smaller scale than that routinely inflicted by
the armed forces of &#8216;civilised&#8217; states.</p>

<p>Never has a point made by Trotsky been more relevant. In
criticising terrorist acts, he wrote, it was important not to side
with &#8216;those bought and paid for moralists&#8217; (Tony Blair and Jack
Straw spring to mind) who &#8216;make solemn declarations about the
&#8220;absolute value&#8221; of human life&#8217;. <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a></p>

<p>The Marxist tradition has never approved of terrorism as a method
of social change, and sees it as a counterproductive strategy. But we
cannot join in the condemnations that pour from the lips of
politicians and from the media &#8211; despite enormous pressure to do
so. We cannot begin to shape our critique of terrorism meaningfully
unless we start with the horrors of imperialist violence and the
Islamophobic racism directed at Muslims. We shall not be able to
intervene in the movement to explain why young Muslims resort to such
terrible tactics. Nor will be able to offer an alternative that can
offer hope to those whose despair pushes them into the dead end of
terrorism.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f23" name="n23">23.</a> As above, p.&nbsp;191. Worth noting is Lenin&#8217;s implied
distinction between single and collective combat. As his comments on
the need for an armed uprising in 1905 indicate, &#8216;intelligentsia
terrorism&#8217;, separate from the mass movement, was something that had
to be opposed, but not the kind of strength exemplified in &#8216;the
terrorism of the great French Revolution&#8217;, which is &#8216;the strength
of the revolutionary movement of the people&#8217; (V.I. Lenin, <strong>Collected
Works</strong>, vol.&nbsp;8 (Moscow 1962), pp.&nbsp;160&#8211;161. Equally,
Lenin considered it wrong to condemn guerrilla operations as
&#8216;terrorist&#8217; since they were neither acts of individual vengeance
nor did they spring from lack of faith in working class insurrection
(though, of course, mistakes were possible) (V.I. Lenin, <strong>Collected
Works</strong>, vol.&nbsp;10 (Moscow 1962), pp.&nbsp;117&#8211;118). The
point, here, is that Lenin&#8217;s condemnation of individual terrorism
was never a condemnation of revolutionary violence.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f24" name="n24">24.</a> As above, p.&nbsp;190.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f25" name="n25">25.</a> The essence of Lenin&#8217;s critique of &#8216;economism&#8217; in Russian Social Democracy was that in constraining socialist activity
to &#8216;economic&#8217; questions, on the one hand, and &#8216;political&#8217;
support for liberal-bourgeois demands, on the other, &#8216;economism&#8217;
was a variant, in the peculiar conditions of Russian society where
democratic institutions barely existed, of the revisionist/reformist
adaptation to parliamentarianism that had become a strong feature of
socialist parties in Western Europe. See <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1899/dec/trend.htm" target="new"><em>A Retrograde Step in Russian Social-Democracy</em></a>, in V.I. Lenin, <strong>Collected Works</strong>,
vol.&nbsp;4 (Moscow 1961), in particular pp.&nbsp;278&#8211;279; and the
section <em>What Is There in Common Between Economism and Terrorism?</em>,
in <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/index.htm" target="new"><strong>What Is To Be Done?</strong></a> in V.I. Lenin, <strong>Collected Works</strong>, vol.&nbsp;5 (Moscow 1961), pp.&nbsp;417&#8211;421.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f26" name="n26">26.</a> Victor Serge left a vivid but critical impression of this kind
of milieu (which he knew intimately as a result of his involvement
with the notorious anarchist Bonnot gang on the eve of the First
World War). What he encountered was &#8216;exacting idealism, in the
breasts of uncomplicated men whose energy could find no outlet in
achieving a higher dignity or sensibility, because any such outlet
was physically denied to them. Conscious of their frustration, they
battled like madmen and were beaten down. In those times the world
was an integrated structure, so stable in appearance that no
possibility of substantial change was visible within it. As it
progressed up and up, and on and on, masses of people who lay in its
path were all the while being crushed. The harsh condition of the
workers improved only very slowly, and for the vast majority of the
proletariat there was no way out. The declassed elements on the
proletarian fringe found all roads barred to them except those which
led to squalor and degradation. Above the heads of these masses,
wealth accumulated, insolent and proud. The consequences of this
situation arose inexorably: crime, class struggles and their trail of
bloody strikes, and frenzied battles of One against All. These
struggles also testified to the failure of an ideology&#8217; (V. Serge,
<strong>Memoirs of a Revolutionary</strong> (Oxford 1967), p.&nbsp;42).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f28" name="n28">28.</a> As above, pp.&nbsp;113&#8211;114.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f29" name="n29">29.</a> Joll says the crowd consisted of &#8216;modest Parisian
shopkeepers, clerks and even workers&#8217; (p.&nbsp;118). The question
of the social composition of the crowd may seem irrelevant, but it is
possible that, just as in a terrorist attack on a music hall in Lyons
in 1882, Henry saw the cafe as an institution representative of
&#8216;false, bourgeois values&#8217; (Joll, as above, p.&nbsp;112) &#8211; which
may explain the motivation he provided at the trial (see the
quotation below).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f30" name="n30">30.</a> Both Kedward, as above, pp.&nbsp;41&#8211;42, and Joll, as above, pp.&nbsp;117&#8211;119, provide detailed accounts. According to Kedward,
p.&nbsp;42, at his trial Henry was clinical and detached. He welcomed
the sentence of death and refused to apply for a reprieve. This calm
readiness for death anticipates the acceptance of self-extinction
that characterises today&#8217;s suicide bombers. [<strong>Note by ETOL:</strong>
There is no earlier reference to a book by Kedward, but we assume
that the following is the book referred to: H.R. Kedward, <strong>The
Anarchists: The Men Who Shocked an Era</strong> (London 1971).]/p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f32" name="n32">32.</a> Quoted in Joll, as above, p.&nbsp;119.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f33" name="n33">33.</a> Woodcock, as above.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f34" name="n34">34.</a> Particularly in bohemian milieux. One anarchist writer,
himself a victim of a bomb explosion in a restaurant, said, &#8216;What
does humanity matter, provided the act is beautiful? (<em>&#8216;Qu&#8217;importe
les vagues humanit&#233;s, pourvu que le geste soit beau?&#8217;</em>), quoted
in Joll, as above, p.&nbsp;152. The poet St&#233;phane Mallarm&#233;, famed
for his rarefied aestheticism, would not discuss &#8216;the acts of these
saints&#8217; when pressed for his reactions to terrorism (Joll, as
above, p.&nbsp;150). The Anglo-Polish writer Joseph Conrad drew a
much less sympathetic portrait of anarchists and terrorism in his
1907 novel <a href="https://archive.org/details/Joseph_Conrad__The_Secret_Agent" target="new"><strong>The Secret Agent</strong></a>, which was based on an attempt to blow up Greenwich Observatory.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f35" name="n35">35.</a> He was right. The first victim of these laws was a Breton socialist.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f37" name="n37">37.</a> Quoted in H. Goldberg, <strong>The Life of Jean Jaur&#232;s</strong>
(Madison 1962), p.&nbsp;120.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f38" name="n38">38.</a> He wrote in <strong>La petite R&#233;publique</strong> in early 1894 that
Vaillant was not inherently evil &#8211; he was victim of society, moved
by hatred of life to die for something meaningful. Along with other
socialists he signed an appeal for clemency, which Sadi Carnot
refused to grant. See Goldberg, as above, p.&nbsp;121.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f39" name="n39">39.</a> The equivalent then of today&#8217;s move to criminalise &#8216;the glorification of terrorism&#8217; and to abolish habeas corpus for
&#8216;terrorist offences&#8217;.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f40" name="n40">40.</a> H Goldberg, as above, pp.&nbsp;126-127. So shaken was the
ministry that it survived a vote of censure by only one vote.</p>

the more convincing. His rejection of the myths surrounding &#8216;Islamic
terrorism&#8217; is because he sees them, and their use in Bush&#8217;s war
on terror and occupation of Iraq, as counterproductive to the
interests of &#8216;democracy&#8217; &#8211; i.e. US imperialism (which he supports).</p>
