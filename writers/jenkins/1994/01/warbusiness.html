<p class="fst"><strong>Mother Courage and her Children</strong><br/>
by Bertolt Brecht</p>

<p class="fst">The two world wars this century have sometimes been seen as one
continuous war, a struggle over conflicting imperialist aims which
the 1919 Treaty of Versailles failed to resolve. The outbreak of
fighting in 1939 (the year in which Brecht wrote <em>Mother Courage</em>)
was merely the resumption of unfinished business after a 20 year truce.</p>

<p>There is a parallel with the Thirty Years War in Germany in the
early 17th century, which Brecht used for his play. A series of
struggles between marauding Protestant and Catholic armies, which
drew in all the major European powers, plunged the heart of the
continent into an era of unprecedented savagery.</p>

<p>Brecht created <em>Mother Courage</em> as an &#8216;ordinary&#8217;
character trying to make ends meet. With her canteen wagon she
wanders across the ruined continent selling drink, food and other
vital supplies to the rival armies so that she can support herself
and her three children.</p>

<p>As such she invites our compassion. But Brecht doesn&#8217;t want us
to ignore her other side. She survives as a business woman who makes
a living out of the war. In her small way she does what the marauding
armies do: survive at the expense of others.</p>

<p>The terrible irony of her situation is that what starts as a way
of protecting those she loves ends by killing them.</p>

<p>Mother Courage loses her elder son, Eilif, to the army while she
is haggling over a belt. She loses her second son, Swiss Cheese, who
is killed because she cannot resist haggling over the price of his
ransom. There is a further twist to the agony. Courage has to deny
that the body of her son is hers in order to avoid further
retribution. Finally, she loses her daughter, who is shot, because
she is off trading in the city.</p>

<p>So the action of the play is designed to bring judgement to our
sympathy. People may be victims of larger historical processes that
crush them but what they do, or don&#8217;t do, contributes to that process.</p>

<p>Commonsense slogans, which pepper the play, are precisely what tie
ordinary people to perpetuating the misery that the great and the
powerful let loose on the world. We need to respond to the horror of
what we see, not by wallowing in facile emotions of pity but by using
our minds to think beyond commonsense slogans. We should be distanced
from the events on the stage so that we leave the play better able to
change the world.</p>

<p>This new version by Hanif Kureishi is lively and racy, the acting
is good, and Ellie Haddington as Mother Courage is excellent. So too
is the staging. But it&#8217;s not sharp enough. Mother Courage is a
touch too loveable; not enough of the battlefield vulture comes across.</p>

<p>Perhaps this connects with one feature of the funding that would
have amused Brecht. A programme slip proudly announces that the
production is sponsored by British Petroleum and could not have been
mounted without their funding. For a play that looks at the theme of
exploitation I can&#8217;t help wondering whether Brecht or BP is the winner.</p>
