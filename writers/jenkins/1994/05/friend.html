<p class="fst"><strong>Daens</strong><br/>
Dir: Stijn Coninx</p>

<p class="fst">One image dominates the opening of the film. We are in a textile
factory in the Flemish town of Aalst. As the mechanical loom is
pushed forward, small children advance on their knees, picking up
bits of cotton. They have to be alert, for the loom is pulled back
and any child caught unawares risks being crushed.</p>

<p>This is late 19th century Belgian capitalism, red in tooth and
claw. Recession grips the country. The French speaking bourgeoisie
argue among themselves about whether they can cut wages any further.
They also attempt to keep socialist agitation to a minimum &#8211;
through control of the non-socialist press, religion and by
recruiting thugs to keep order. The workers themselves are cowed into
sullen anger.</p>

<p>Into this grim world comes a priest, Father Daens. Appalled by the
poverty he encounters, he denounces the bourgeoisie from the pulpit.
Fighting every obstacle they put in his way, he eventually gets
elected to parliament to give the textile workers a voice. This rebel
against the Catholic hierarchy takes seriously what Pope Leo XIII
says in his encyclical, that the workers have rights which must be
respected. He soon discovers that the Church does not.</p>

<p>This film is not just about what happens to religious rebels who
sympathise with the appalling suffering of the working class from the
outside. It focuses on how workers themselves, through their own
experience, begin to abandon religious illusions.</p>

<p>At the centre of the film is a young woman textile worker from a
Catholic family. Her elder brother is a member of the bosses&#8217; band
of thugs. She resents but puts up with the attentions of the foreman.
But she is no socialist. She mocks the young socialist attempting to
sell his socialist papers.</p>

<p>Daens, on the other hand, does command her respect. She begins to
have hope when Daens forces the government to send a commission of
inquiry to inspect the horrible conditions of the factory she works
in. It is a naive hope that the great and the good will listen once
the truth is known. Though warned by the foreman not to step out of
line, she attempts to speak directly to one of the commissioners &#8211;
only to find that he speaks no Flemish and she no French.</p>

<p>When one of the children picking up cotton is killed she leads a
march of fellow workers to the commission. This time she hopes that
the mangled child in her arms will be tangible proof that transcends
the divisions of language. The march has religious overtones. It is
like a procession with the dead child as a Christ figure. Her
illusions are shattered when the mounted gendarmerie cut down the procession.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to be reminded of the procession led by
Father Gapon in the 1905 Russian Revolution. Workers whose
consciousness was totally shaped by religion also had illusions that
the Tsar, their little father, would understand their plight.</p>

<p>The Flemish society depicted in the film is not as steeped in
religion as Russia was. Nevertheless it is a society in which
religion plays a major role in dividing the working class. Under
pressure of class conflict the religion of the poor becomes a weapon
against the ruling class. In the process both dissident priest and
radicalised religious workers move beyond religion, even if they
retain its forms.</p>

<p>Indeed, the film is about the shedding of other illusions besides
religion. When Father Daens eventually gets into parliament, he soon
discovers that his splendid denunciation of the factory owners is
insufficient. Parliament is not the friend of the workers any more
than the Pope is.</p>

<p>The film ends on a sober note. Daens has been expelled from the
church. The young woman has been raped by the foreman. The workers
appear no further forward than they were at the beginning, despite
the demonstrations and the fights to get Daens elected. But something
crucial has been learnt. As Daens himself puts it, the workers have
no friends above them and only themselves to rely on. It is a hard
lesson &#8211; but not a pessimistic one.</p>

<p>It is impossible to leave the cinema without being deeply moved
but at the same time utterly optimistic about the future for the
workers&#8217; struggles. This is a brilliant film which no socialist
should miss.</p>
