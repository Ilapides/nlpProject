<p class="c"><strong>&#8216;For much of the novel George Eliot seems to
be in two minds about her attitude towards change ...&#8217;</strong></p>

<p class="fst">Transferring the classics to the small screen can sometimes be an
exercise in nostalgia for a cultural back to basics. Whether
<em>Middlemarch</em> succumbs remains to be seen. But if the adaptation
wins new readers for the novel then all well and good.</p>

<p>George Eliot (born Mary Ann Evans) wrote the novel in 1871&#8211;72.
It looked back to the period just before the Reform Bill of 1832, the
period when the British bourgeoisie &#8211; the factory owning class &#8211;
forced its way into parliament. The captains of industry weren&#8217;t
exactly waging war on the old aristocracy. But there were high hopes
that something more than simply expanding the franchise might come of
parliamentary reform.</p>

<p>In reality those hopes quickly faded. Social advance proved less
than glorious and frustration and disappointment are central to the
novel. The two characters who dominate the book, Dorothea Brooke and
Tertius Lydgate, start their adult lives with a burning conviction
that conditions can be improved for the mass of the population.
Dorothea wants to devote her wealth not to the frivolous pursuits of
the landed gentry she has been born to but to noble causes: building
model houses and repairing the homes of her uncle&#8217;s tenants.</p>

<p>She also wants a nobler life for herself. As a woman she is denied
access to real education. She is expected to be interested in the
feminine pastimes of her class: jewellery, visits and gossip &#8211; a
life her sister is perfectly prepared to settle down to. So Dorothea
hopes she can gain access to education through marrying knowledge.
Her clergyman husband is engaged in strenuous mental labour,
synthesising all past cultures, which she wants to help him with and
thereby help diffuse it to a larger audience.</p>

<p>Lydgate is the man of science. He too has turned his back on his
class to study medicine, not for a comfortable provincial practice,
but to extend the boundaries of medical understanding and improve the
health of the people.</p>

<p>But these wide horizons are rapidly narrowed by the characters&#8217;
own shortcomings and what George Eliot calls &#8216;the meanness of
opportunity&#8217;. The epic life is not available to an upper class 19th
century woman who cannot see what is plain to everyone else: that her
husband, the Reverend Edward Casaubon, is a dried up pedant whose
knowledge is useless and old fashioned.</p>

<p>Marriage seals her in a living tomb. Marriage also seals the fate
of Lydgate. He falls for the lovely Rosamund Vincy, who has been
turned out by the best local finishing school her father, the mayor,
can buy. Lydgate&#8217;s &#8216;spot of commonness&#8217; is to see in her the
woman who can adorn his life while he gets on with his scientific
research. And she sees in him the realisation of her dreams of moving
up the social scale.</p>

<p>Before long their mutual infatuation turns to mutual contempt, the
marriage descending into a deadly tussle of wills, with victory going
to the placid but determined Rosamund.</p>

<p>Some of the best passages of the novel are those which trace the
way in which the reality of the wedded state dawns on the characters.
George Eliot refuses to simplify the characters into goodies and
baddies. Casaubon&#8217;s coldness and emotional cruelty towards Dorothea
follows from his realisation of his own inadequacy. Rosamund&#8217;s
childish obstinacy stems from the way she has been &#8216;infantalised&#8217;
to become the perfect wife.</p>

<p>The characters produce their own misery but they are also products
of their social environment. The novel is set in middle England with
its provincial limitations and habits. But events are also in mid
march towards a newer England. An older, more enclosed world is dying
out to be replaced by speedier communications and more cosmopolitan ideas.</p>

<p>There are gains and losses. Dorothea glimpses that new world in
the art and culture of Rome, which she encounters on her honeymoon
and which so shocks her provincial, Protestant soul. She also
encounters it in her deepening relationship with Will Ladislaw, the
cosmopolitan (Polish, Jewish, English) cousin of Casaubon. But
Ladislaw is rootless, drifting from one enthusiasm to another, in
both art and politics, even though his sympathies are wider than Casaubon&#8217;s.</p>

<p>For much of the novel George Eliot seems to be in two minds about
her attitude towards change. There is irony both at the expense of
dull, plodding Middlemarch society and at that of bright new ideas
for reforming the world. She sympathises with the passion for change
but also warns against wanting to progress too fast.</p>
<p>In many ways she was the classic Victorian liberal, against both
conservatism and radicalism, looking for a middle way, evolution
rather than revolution. The novel concludes with the observation that
&#8216;the growing good of the world is partly dependent on the
unhistoric acts.&#8217;</p>

<p>The message is: trust the slow path of progress and avoid heroics.
This explains some of the weaker sides of the novel, such as the
relationship between Ladislaw and the banker Bulstrode. For it turns
out that Bulstrode has a shady past and a set of unconvincing
coincidences lead both to his exposure and to the removal of
obstacles to Ladislaw marrying Dorothea after the death of Casaubon.</p>

<p>There has to be, at one level, a happy ending because there has to
be a reward for wanting to improve the human condition. But because
George Eliot cannot put her trust in change from below (ordinary
people are too ignorant, heroic individuals too likely to be naive
idealists, or worse) she has to put her trust in the conviction that
events will come out right. Hence the creakiness of the plot at
points in the novel.</p>

<p>But the novel is not dominated by the author&#8217;s ideological
commitment to gradualism. Lydgate may go down to defeat, becoming a
society doctor whose claim to fame is his treatise on the rich man&#8217;s
disease of gout rather than his research to improve the health of the
poor. And Dorothea may not rise above being the wife of &#8216;an ardent
public man, working well in those times when reforms were begun with
a young hopefulness of immediate good which has been much checked in
our days&#8217;.</p>

<p>But what remains, and what makes the novel so brilliant at its
best, is the enduring conviction that struggle is needed to bring
about a new world &#8211; even if that world is a mediocre one that
wastes and abuses the passion which brought it to birth.</p>
