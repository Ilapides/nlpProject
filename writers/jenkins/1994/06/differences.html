<p class="fst"><strong>The Serge-Trotsky Papers: Correspondence and Other Writings between Victor Serge and Trotsky</strong><br/>
Ed: David Cotterill<br/>
<em>Pluto &#163;14.95</em></p>

<p class="fst">Victor Serge was one of the very few revolutionaries to survive
Stalinist persecution in Russia. He survived because his fiction and
above all his account of the Bolshevik triumph in 1917, <strong>Year One
of the Russian Revolution</strong>, had caused a stir in France. A
vigorous campaign forced the Stalinist bureaucracy to release Serge
from internal exile and in early 1936 to expel him from the Soviet
Union. It was not a moment too soon. Had he remained he would
undoubtedly have perished, like thousands of others, in the great
purges which started later that year.</p>

<p>However, Serge&#8217;s problems were not over. In Belgium, where he
first settled, and then in France, he was treated with suspicion by
the authorities and the Stalinists continued to hound him in their
press. His wife&#8217;s mental illness made their lives a misery.
Politically, there were few outlets. The majority of left leaning
intellectuals rallied to Stalin as the defender of the Popular Front
against fascism. Criticism of the Soviet Union from a revolutionary
point of view was taboo.</p>

<p>There remained only Leon Trotsky as a figure of any stature, a
survivor, like Serge, from the heroic days of the revolution and like
him an opponent of Stalinism. But Serge and Trotsky did not join in
agreement and common work, despite the fact that Serge had rallied to
the Left Opposition as early as 1923 and refused to capitulate when
many others did go. They fell out over what line to take towards the
Spanish revolutionary party, the POUM; over the significance of the
Kronstadt revolt of 1921; and over the creation of the Fourth
International, a new revolutionary international organisation to
replace the Stalinist one.</p>

<p>This book tells the story of their disagreements and reproduces
the relevant documents &#8211; letters and extracts from articles, some
of which are published for the first time.</p>

<p>Who was right? David Cotterill and his fellow writers tend to
accept Serge&#8217;s point of view and on the face of it Serge&#8217;s case
was strong. The tiny groups adhering to Trotsky and the Fourth
International were marginal to the working class and seemed to spend
more time feuding with one another than directing their energies
outwards. Serge felt that their sectarianism made genuine
revolutionary work impossible. Better to operate with other left
parties with some roots in the working class. In Spain this meant
working with the POUM, a Marxist party with real influence amongst workers.</p>

<p>Serge came to feel that the persecution suffered by the Left
Opposition was contaminating it. Intolerance to other tendencies on
the left was replacing fraternal debate. Stalinist dogmatism was
breeding a similar dogmatism among their Trotskyist victims. An
unquestioning defence of everything that happened in revolutionary
Russia while Lenin and Trotsky were at the helm was becoming a new
orthodoxy to rival the Stalinist orthodoxy. Not even Trotsky, for
whom Serge continued to profess the greatest admiration, was, he
felt, exempt from this tendency.</p>

<p>Serge appears open-minded and Trotsky impervious to debate in this
reading of their differences. It is easy to find evidence to back
this up. There is, for instance, Trotsky&#8217;s furious personal attack
over the misleading summary inserted in front of Serge&#8217;s
translation of Trotsky&#8217;s <strong>Their Morals and Ours</strong>.</p>

<p>But Serge&#8217;s case is overall a weak one. It is clear that Serge
concentrates on matters such as Trotsky&#8217;s style of argument and
failure to acknowledge errors of fact, to avoid facing up to
Trotsky&#8217;s searching political questions. Trotsky argued that the
POUM&#8217;s policy of entering the Spanish Popular Front was disastrous
and that its failure would ruin the Spanish Revolution&#8217;s chances of victory.</p>

<p>And so it proved. Serge preferred being &#8216;unsectarian&#8217; but
politically evasive towards the leaders of the POUM instead of
reinforcing Trotsky&#8217;s unsparing analysis. The result could only be,
for someone so closely connected with Trotsky and the Russian Left
Opposition, to sow confusion.</p>

<p>The same is true of Kronstadt. Either the suppression of the
mutiny was necessary to avoid counter-revolution or it was not. Again
Serge was evasive: to read his comments is to see him trying to have
the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>No wonder Trotsky was so exasperated. Even Serge&#8217;s assessment of
the Fourth International was unsatisfactory. He could have used his
immense talents and his experience to work to overcome its
sectarianism. Instead he frittered them on keeping in with centrist
forces, which, though larger and more working class, stood the test
of struggle less well than the Fourth International.</p>

<p>The book&#8217;s value is that it gives us more of Serge&#8217;s writings.
Yet its implicit claim, that Serge&#8217;s criticism of Trotsky has real
weight, is unsustainable.</p>
