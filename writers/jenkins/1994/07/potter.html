<p class="fst">Those who watched Dennis Potter&#8217;s last interview, given when he
was racing against death to complete his last two plays, will have
been moved by his personal courage and that he was still committed to
fighting back against what he once called &#8216;the occupying power&#8217;.</p>

<p>His weapon was writing &#8211; not for himself but for the millions
who have access to television and who are perpetually threatened by
the deadening effects of commercialisation.</p>

<p>The price Potter paid for writing serious but accessible
television drama was a vicious campaign waged by Mary Whitehouse and
the rest of the morality brigade. He was attacked for bringing bad
language and sex to the small screen.</p>

<p>This campaign frightened the BBC into banning one of his best
plays, <em>Brimstone and Treacle</em>, for over a decade. Nevertheless
Potter kept up a breathtaking output, with his phenomenally
successful plays, <em>Pennies from Heaven</em> (1978) and <em>The
Singing Detective</em> (1986), proving that a mass audience could be
created for complex and challenging culture.</p>

<p>Potter was a political writer. He was clearly on the left, but
suspicious of pat phrases and easy solutions. Perhaps this reflected
his own personal development and the political period that formed him.</p>

<p>He was born in 1935. His father was a coalminer in the Forest of
Dean, an area of industrial villages between Gloucester and Wales. He
gained a scholarship to Oxford University and then started work in
the BBC in the late 1950s. He also worked as a journalist and thought
about becoming a Labour MP before embarking on his career as a
television playwright.</p>

<p>This left him with a tangled sense of where he belonged. As a
working class grammar school boy he did not fit into the privileged
world of Oxford. He saw and criticised the society it represented
from the outside. At the same time he was for ever cut off from his background.</p>

<p>There was no possibility of returning to the &#8216;land of lost
content&#8217; &#8211; a line he used in <em>Blue Remembered Hills</em> (1979),
which explored childhood with all the children played by adults. He
did not wallow in nostalgia. If he hated the narrow ruling class
interests masquerading under the high culture to which he was
educated, he did not forget that the close knit community from which
he came could be cruel and repressive. At the same time he felt
guilty at denying his family and community as the price paid for
widening his intellectual horizons. He was both victim and traitor.</p>

<p>This complex double role was a theme he constantly returned to in
his plays, particularly when he explored its roots in childhood
trauma. <em>The Singing Detective</em>, Philip Marlowe, is haunted by
it as he delves into his past and begins to realise the
responsibility he bears for his fate.</p>

<p>We see virtually the same images of childhood in the play Potter
wrote 20 years earlier, <em>Stand Up, Nigel Barton</em>. This and its
companion piece, <em>Vote, Vote Vote for Nigel Barton</em>, show
Nigel&#8217;s use and betrayal of his working class roots.</p>

<p>Potter never settled for easy explanations of complex personal and
social problems. He always went for uncomfortable topics. The most
memorable of these was the banned <em>Brimstone and Treacle</em>. This
featured what was becoming a central feature in Potter&#8217;s work &#8211;
the use of fantasy to explore the dreams of &#8216;ordinary&#8217; people and
show what lurked beneath the appearance of respectability.</p>

<p><em>Brimstone and Treacle</em> features a suburban couple whose
lives have been wrecked because their daughter, Pattie, has been
reduced to a drooling, slobbering wreck as the result of a car
accident. Into their lives walks Martin, who claims to have known her
before her accident and whose wholesome niceness offers relief from
the everyday burden of caring for her. But his miraculous presence
proves (literally) diabolical. He rapes the girl and she is restored
to a &#8216;normality&#8217; which reflects badly on her father&#8217;s sexual morality.</p>

<p>The devil who walks into this couple&#8217;s life is not an outsider.
He brings out what is diabolical in the situation of suburban
respectability: the mother&#8217;s vulnerability to religious
manipulation and the father&#8217;s membership of the National Front.</p>

<p>Potter&#8217;s most ambitious work came after the excruciating skin
disease which paralysed him and nearly ended his writing career. In
<em>Pennies From Heaven</em>, <em>The Singing Detective</em> and <em>Lipstick
on Your Collar</em> he looked at the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s
respectively and perfected the technique of using popular songs as
expressions of people&#8217;s dreams.</p>

<p>He was neither sentimental nor dismissive about images of popular
culture. In a cheap and nasty world, the heaven people search for
cannot avoid being cheap and nasty. But their aspirations are still
compelling for all that.</p>

<p>Potter also wanted to show individual aspiration in a collective
context. In <em>Pennies from Heaven</em> this was the little man
dreaming of independence in a world where no such independence is
possible. Arthur&#8217;s ambitions to make something of his life, have
his own business and profit from the new, expanding world of song
recordings perpetually runs up against his own limitations.</p>

<p>In <em>The Singing Detective</em> there was the same attempt to mix
fantasy and reality, the personal and the social. The &#8216;hero&#8217;, the
aptly named Philip Marlowe, has a mixture of self loathing and
paranoid contempt for his fellow human beings. In <em>Lipstick on Your
Collar</em> the focus is on the Suez crisis, an episode which marked
the eclipse of British imperial power and the triumph of the US as a
world power.</p>

<p>His hatred of &#8216;the occupying power&#8217; went with a proud love of
the country under occupation, which smuggled in a kind of nationalism
by the back door which had been kicked out the front.</p>

<p>It was similar to his fascination for religion&#8217;s role in
people&#8217;s lives, which came close to a kind of surreptitious
endorsement.</p>

<p>But these are minor difficulties. All the indications are that his
last works, <em>Karaoke</em> and <em>Cold Lazarus</em>, will confirm his
achievement as the greatest television dramatist.</p>
