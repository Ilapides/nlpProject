<p class="c">Corruption at Westminster is widely claimed to be an aberration
by a few rotten apples. <em>Gareth Jenkins</em> explains
its systematic and historical basis</p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;This country has an international reputation for the integrity
and honour of its public institutions,&#8217; said John Major last month.
This was despite the resignation of two ministers accused of taking
cash in return for asking questions, and the publicity around hotel
bills at the Paris Ritz.</p>

<p>Parliamentary representatives should serve the interests of those
who elect them. They should neither line their pockets by abusing
their position nor act on behalf of private interests. No MP should
be in effect the MP for Harrods or for Blue Circle. And who would
disagree? Accountability is the lifeblood of any democratic process
and MPs should be as accountable as possible. The more restrictions
on MPs being able to &#8216;supplement&#8217; their income by being part time
dentists or by becoming &#8216;advisers&#8217; to lobbying companies the better.</p>

<p>However, parliament is not the democratic centre of our society as
Tory and Labour politicians constantly tell us. The Tories have an
obvious interest in the parliamentary myth as a way of diverting our
attention from the reality. They represent not us but the people in
the unelected part of the state machine (judges, top cops, army
chiefs) and in company boardrooms (accountable only to shareholders),
who take all the crucial decisions affecting our lives.</p>

<p>Labour on the other hand is in a different position. The judges,
top cops, army chiefs and company bosses profoundly distrust the
Labour Party because of the class gulf between themselves and the
vast mass of people who vote for Labour. Labour can court
representatives of the ruling class on the prawn cocktail circuit as
much as it likes &#8211; it never has the class identity with them that
the Tories enjoy. But because Labour sees no other avenue for change
except operating through parliament, Labour too has to invite us to
trust in its basic soundness.</p>

<p>This blunts its attack on corruption. Just as it makes concessions
to the market in order to make it acceptable to the economic
priorities of the boss class, so too it makes concessions to the
deception that parliament has real control over the bosses or that it
can ever be the servant of the mass of the working population.</p>

<p>Yet corruption has always played a part in the &#8216;Mother of
Parliaments&#8217;. Parliament emerged historically as the instrument of
the capitalist class. That may have enabled it to play a heroic part
in the struggle against aristocratic and feudal reaction, culminating
in the English Revolution of the mid-17th century. But with the
emerging capitalists more or less firmly in the saddle thereafter, it
has never departed from its role as the servant of that class.</p>

<p>The long history of corruption from that day to this is not an
aberration but an expression of this role as different sections of
the ruling class have jockeyed for influence with MPs and governments
to advance their interests.</p>

<p>Sometimes this involved the most naked forms of corruption. In the
18th century MPs were little more than paid lackeys of the
landowners, now thoroughly imbued with the new commercial ethic.
Contracts, titles and favours went with the job. Robert Walpole, the
Whig prime minister in the first half of the century, regularly used
Treasury coffers to pay for support for his government.</p>

<p>Politics was literally the business of a few who could buy votes
as they chose. What the vast majority wanted could be safely ignored
as there was little sense that parliament represented anything except
the interests of the men of property.</p>

<p>That began to change with the growth of radicalism, especially in
the first half of the 19th century. Democracy became a force that
could not be ignored when it became tied to the mass working class
movement of Chartism. The ruling class was forced to concede inroads
into what had hitherto been its exclusive debating forum &#8211;
parliament. Our rulers didn&#8217;t like the fact that they were more
open to public scrutiny. But there was a certain advantage for them.
If they could persuade the mass of the population to see parliament
as the one and only place for &#8216;politics&#8217;, then the fact that
politics happened elsewhere &#8211; in the private debates among judges,
generals, chief constables and the captains of industry &#8211; could be
glossed over.</p>

<p>But to make parliament credibly appear to reflect the interests of
society as a whole, the obvious corruption would have to be swept out
of view. No more could the election of MPs be secured by bribery or
coercion, a relatively frequent occurrence as the novels of Dickens
and Trollope show. In the 1870s and 1880s, with the newly
enfranchised masses needing to have their respect for parliament
confirmed, the Liberal statesman William Gladstone brought in the
secret ballot and limited electoral spending.</p>

<p>The myth of MPs&#8217; public accountability dates from this period of
reform. When Labour entered the scene a little later the myth was
confirmed rather than challenged. Yet in reality the corruption
continued. Even Gladstone, the reform minded prime minister, sold
honours in exchange for cash to fill party coffers, a habit taken up
vigorously by his successors, Liberal and Tory alike.</p>

<p>Initially the whole process was fairly discreet. But by 1922 the
scandal became open. For the previous six years Lloyd George, the
Liberal prime minister, had been promising peerages to his cronies &#8211;
without even bothering to get royal clearance. One baronetcy went to
a convicted wartime food racketeer and another was offered to a South
African diamond merchant found guilty of serious fraud. The war had
been fought for profit and parliament was full of hard faced men who
had done well out of it. The scandal could not be toughed out,
however, because this was also the period of heightened class
antagonism. There had to be an attempt to rehabilitate parliament in
the eyes of the masses. A debate in parliament led to the downfall of
the government and the setting up of a Royal Commission.</p>

<p>This made not a jot of difference. The network of contacts
masterminded by Maundy Gregory, who had been whisked away to France
by his Tory backers just as the scandal broke, continued to operate.
Several Indian princes were persuaded to part with &#163;3 million in
today&#8217;s money.</p>

<p>Faced with a choice between letting the corruption continue and
discrediting parliament in the eyes of the voter, no politician was
prepared to tolerate the latter. In 1934 Ramsay MacDonald, former
Labour politician, reluctantly colluded in the corruption and gave
one of Gregory&#8217;s protectors a knighthood. As Stanley Baldwin, the
Tory leader, put it, the alternative was to let Gregory &#8216;stir up
such a filthy sewer as would poison public life&#8217;. This would have
exposed the Royal Commission as a sham.</p>

<p>After the war, in the context of the long economic boom and
absence of political crisis, corruption was a tamer affair. But it
did not disappear. It flourished strongly in local government.
Financial sleaze connected local government officials and companies
anxious to make lucrative contracts out of the massive rebuilding
programmes in the inner city areas. The architect John Poulson, whose
construction company paid T. Dan Smith, Labour leader of Newcastle, a
&#8216;fee&#8217; of &#163;155,000, was the most well known symbol of much wider
corruption. Both went to jail. Poulson&#8217;s associate, Tory minister
Reggie Maudling, resigned in 1972 after being exposed by Paul Foot in
<strong>Private Eye</strong>.</p>

<p>But this is small beer compared with the corruption which has
swollen over the last 15 years. The Tories have been so long in power
that some MPs think they are untouchable, greedy as a result of their
government&#8217;s deregulation and privatisation measures and careless
about openly abusing their positions of privilege. The economic
crisis has also meant that access to government decision making has
become more keenly contested.</p>

<p>This is particularly true of sections of industry like defence and
construction eager at any cost to secure lucrative overseas
contracts. The stickiest web of corruption involves arms sales to the
Middle East and massive projects like the Pergau dam project in
Malaysia. The revelations and allegations about Mark Thatcher,
Jonathan Aitken, Saudi businessmen and former ministers are only the
tip of an exceedingly murky iceberg.</p>

<p>Corruption dogs the institution of parliament, whether in its
early days, when it was unreformed and in the possession of a tiny
minority, or whether in its maturity, when it was reformed and
supposedly the expression of the interests of the majority. For in
effect, whether the number of voters is a handful or whether every
adult over the age of 18 has a vote, it has never and can never
belong to the majority. In a class society, where the economy is
owned and controlled by a minority, so too is every political
institution, however democratic the appearance.</p>

<p>The levels of corruption may vary, depending on the health of the
economy and the degree of political crisis, but corruption and
parliament are inseparable. Essentially, parliament is unreformable.
But we should not be indifferent to these scandals. They are an
expression of the contempt our rulers have for the democracy they
pretend to stand for and of their personal abuse of public services
while claiming there is no money for things we need, like health and education.</p>

<p>There should be no illusion in parliament&#8217;s ability to solve
these problems. Labour&#8217;s failure to take full advantage of the
Tories&#8217; discomfiture is strange at first sight, given that the
Tories are such an easy target.</p>

<p>The reason for not taking full advantage is that Labour panders to
parliamentary illusions. So it goes along with the idea that the only
way to overcome deviations from the parliamentary ideal is by
trusting to parliamentary procedure. Hence its only quarrel with the
Tories over the Nolan inquiry is the extent of the inquiry&#8217;s brief.</p>

<p>Hence, too, the quandary it finds itself in over the Committee of
Privileges, whose deliberations the government decided would remain
secret. Outraged by this attempt to sweep the dirt under the carpet,
the Labour MPs quite rightly walked out. But since Labour accepts the
idea that you have to work within the committee system and the rules
laid down by parliament, it sees no option but to go back in. Tony
Benn, again quite rightly, decided to make public the committee&#8217;s
secret deliberations. Labour&#8217;s front bench has not backed him
because he is breaking the rules they endorse.</p>

<p>The most glaring example of Labour&#8217;s failure has been its
reaction to the <strong>Guardian</strong>&#8217;s fax to the Ritz. The Tories
jumped on this as an abuse of parliament and a gross deception. Major
appeared at the dispatch box and claimed sanctimoniously that this
was an insult to the highest standards of journalism. &#8216;The end
never justified the means&#8217;, he droned. Labour failed to make the
obvious reply: what&#8217;s a little deception which hurts nobody
compared with the massive deception which enables MPs to have their
hotel bills paid by crooks in exchange for favours over arms deals
that will strengthen the killing powers of despots?</p>

<p>Instead Labour MPs echoed the Tories&#8217; completely bogus anger and
agreed that it was an unpardonable breach of parliamentary rules.
Labour allowed the Tories to go on the offensive as defenders of parliament.</p>

<p>There is no way parliament will reform itself. We shall rid public
life of corruption only by reform from below, from mass activity that
does not look to parliament. In the process we shall discover that
the alternative to parliamentary corruption is not some &#8216;genuine&#8217;
parliament but the democracy of workers&#8217; self organisation.</p>
