<p class="fst"><strong>Socialism from below</strong><br/>
Hal Draper<br/>
<em>Humanities Press &#163;39.95</em></p>

<p class="fst">Nothing has done the cause of socialism more harm than the notion
that socialism equals state control.</p>

<p>The heyday of this idea was the period after the Second World War
and it created a problem for the left. If socialism equalled the
state on the Soviet model, then socialism lacked all democracy. And
if the West was no longer prone to crisis because the state could
regulate the economy, then socialism amounted to management of reforms.</p>

<p>Defence of socialism as not being identical with state control was therefore a burning necessity. It found powerful expression in the work of the American revolutionary socialist Hal Draper, whose marvellous essay <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/1966/twosouls/index.htm" target="new"><em>The Two Souls of Socialism</em></a>, originally written in 1966, is republished in this collection of essays.</p>

<p>The key distinction Draper makes in this article is between
socialism from above and socialism from below.</p>

<p>The idea of emancipation from above, Draper points out, is an old
one, born of centuries of class society and oppression. People look
to a saviour from on high and the rulers preserve their power by
promises of protection. Only with the arrival of the modern working
class could this cycle be broken: liberation from below became for
the first time a real historical possibility.</p>

<p>But old patterns of thought &#8211; of socialism being handed down
from above &#8211; persisted in social democratic reformism and in
Stalinism, not so much opposites as twins. Draper&#8217;s point is that
this emancipation from above is not some easier and safer route to
socialism. It is not socialism at all.</p>

<p>The essays collected here reflect the problems of this period.
There are some articles of variable quality, in which Draper is more
sure-footed when defending what Marx had to say but less so when
applying the tradition (such as the article in which he appears to be
defending free speech for fascists).</p>

<p>Draper&#8217;s politics had one central flaw: he was clear about what
the Soviet regime was not but he could not explain what it was.</p>

<p>Draper believed that the Stalinist regime was bureaucratic
collectivist, a view he shared with other revolutionary socialists
who had split from the Trotskyist movement in the early 1940s.</p>

<p>The analysis left a key question unanswered. Did this bureaucratic
collectivism represent a new world historical trend in exploitation?
Some of those who split from Trotskyism drew the conclusion that
managerialism was the future (and a good thing too); others, that old
style capitalism was more progressive than the new style exploitation.</p>

<p>Either way most believers in the theory of bureaucratic
collectivism (Draper was an honourable exception) retreated rapidly
from socialism. The weakness of this theory, which he clung to, is
evident in one essay reprinted here on how far collectivism had gone
in influencing social democracy.</p>

<p>Draper was better at understanding what Marx stood for than
analysing where the world had got to. Nonetheless, at a time when
workers&#8217; self emancipation as the core of socialism was in danger
of being lost, he was a champion of that idea.</p>
