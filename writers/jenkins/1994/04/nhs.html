<p class="fst">Anyone who uses the National Health Service knows the reality of
long waiting lists, ward closures and an increasingly decrepit service.</p>

<p>Yet the Tories in general, and Virginia Bottomley in particular,
continue to stress that more money than ever is going into the
National Health Service.</p>

<p>So what <em>is</em> happening? Are the Tories pumping money into the
NHS? And what is the effect of their reforms? Labour has pledged to
&#8216;set aside the chaos and waste of the internal market and to take
up the challenge of a health service for the new millennium.&#8217; But
will it?</p>

<p>First, the funding question. The Tories are right when they say
that expenditure on the NHS has been rising. Since the early 1980s
gross NHS expenditure has risen from &#163;16.3 billion (1983&#8211;84) to
&#163;33 billion (1991&#8211;92) and is projected to rise to &#163;40.6 billion
by 1995&#8211;96. Even if we express that as a percentage of gross
domestic product, the amount spent on the NHS has still risen &#8211;
from 5.3 percent in 1983&#8211;84 to 5.7 percent in 1991&#8211;92 (the
projection for 1995&#8211;96 remains at 5.7 percent).</p>

<p>The doctors&#8217; British Medical Association (BMA) has been forced
to admit that in the context of the government&#8217;s attempt to control
public expenditure, health has done relatively well. &#8216;Health
expenditure as a percentage of general government expenditure
(excluding privatisation proceeds) has increased steadily so that
between 1978&#8211;79 and 1991&#8211;92 it has improved its share from 10.4
percent to 12.9 percent.&#8217;</p>

<p>There is no particular mystery as to why this has happened. The
Tories are acutely aware of the perils of an all out assault on the
NHS &#8211; and not just for electoral reasons. They only have to look
across the Atlantic to see the dangers of letting private medicine
run rip. Far from decreasing health costs, the opposite occurs. The
US spends 12.2 percent of its gross domestic product on health. The
rising cost of this policy is beginning to make recession hit
industry squeal with pain. Even so, the figures the Tories brag about
are highly misleading. They do not spell out whether the increase is
enough nor whether it is being spent on the right things.</p>

<p>One obvious test is to compare Britain with other advanced
countries. Britain is clearly low down the international league of
advanced countries. It spends less proportionately than any of its
European Union partners. It devotes 6.2 percent of its gross domestic
product on total health care expenditure. That is 1.7 percent below
the average for the OECD countries (7.9 percent).</p>

<p>There are fewer doctors per head of the population. Britain has
only 1.4 specialist doctors for every thousand of the population.
France, on the other hand, has 2.6, Belgium 3.3 and Germany 2.9. And
for every &#163;5 spent by these countries on health care Britain spends
&#163;2 less.</p>

<p>Using this benchmark of international comparison the BMA reckoned
last October that Britain &#8216;could and should be spending around
another &#163;4.5 billion on the NHS&#8217;. This calculation, it should be
remembered, is no starry eyed socialist estimate &#8211; it simply
compares this country with other capitalist nations of the advanced world.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of what the extra money has been spent
on. Between 1990&#8211;91 and 1991&#8211;92 the total gross expenditure on
the NHS went up by over &#163;3 billion. After deducting the increases in
prices and pay, a record &#163;l. l billion of development money
remained. It could have been spent on patient care. In fact, much of
it wasn&#8217;t. The exercise to review how the NHS expenditure was spent
alone absorbed nearly &#163;400 million. The trust hospitals and GP
fundholders also kept some money back (though how much has not been disclosed).</p>

<p>Far from eliminating waste by introducing the cut and thrust of
the market the whole new system of management has itself spawned a
far more wasteful and greedy bureaucracy than ever existed before.</p>
<p>That is evident not just in the scandalous rise in top management
salaries which hit the headlines earlier this year. The Labour Party
has calculated that the increased costs of management and accounting
that followed the introduction of market style competition have
doubled since they were last in office:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Nearly 11 percent of the NHS budget is now spent on
administration, compared with 6 percent before the Conservatives came
to power. Even since 1979, annual bureaucratic costs have increased
by 110 percent from &#163;1.44 billion to just over &#163;3 billion.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">And most staggering of all: &#8216;NHS senior management costs have
risen 1,800 percent since 1987, from &#163;25.7 million to &#163;494 million
in 1992.&#8217;</p>

<p>That might be bearable if there had been a comparable rise in
money going to patient care. Instead the opposite is the case.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Since the Conservatives came to power in 1979, one in
five hospitals have closed and one in three beds have been lost. In
addition, the number of nurses in training has been cut by almost 20
percent in the present financial year [1993&#8211;94].&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">But if nurses have lost out, administrators have not:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Since the imposition of the government&#8217;s changes the
number of nurses employed in Britain has been cut by 27,000, while
those designated to senior management, administrative and accountancy
posts has increased by 36,000. The spending on cars for senior
management has risen by 30 percent to &#163;70 million in the last year alone.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Little wonder that people&#8217;s experiences differ so markedly from
the rosy picture drawn by Virginia Bottomley and that opinion polls
give the government a 13 percent confidence rating and the secretary
of state the lowest sincerity rating out of all the Tory ministers.</p>

<p>Little wonder too that the government has resorted to the most
elaborate smokescreens to disguise this reality. Where once success
might be reckoned in terms of numbers of patients entering and
leaving hospital, now we have it reckoned in numbers of &#8216;episodes
of care&#8217; &#8211; which can amount to no more than a patient moving to a
different ward (or even a different bed in the same ward!) after an operation.</p>

<p>Waiting lists are also being deliberately distorted. The
government has invented the notion of getting onto a waiting list to
see a consultant for the first time as a way of claiming real
improvements. There is now an all time record of over one million on
the waiting list &#8211; an increase of more than 100,000 since the last
general election.</p>

<p>The reality of what the Tories have done to the NHS became
painfully clear to thousands of people when routine surgery in
hospitals up and down the country had to be cancelled last autumn
because the contracts had run out and there was no money for the rest
of the financial year. All Virginia Bottomley could say was that
hospitals hadn&#8217;t paced themselves properly.</p>

<p>Even the flagship of the new trust system of hospital, designed to
pull the NHS out of stagnation, has been sunk. Guy&#8217;s Hospital in
south London is to be shut, its specialist services transferred
elsewhere, leaving behind a brand new state of the art building worth
&#163;140 million.</p>

<p>The introduction of fundholding for GPs, which was also trumpeted
as improving patient care, is resulting in a two tier service.
Fundholding is an idea imported from the US, where a tendency to shy
away from taking patients who are going to demand a lot of health
care in exchange for little money and to concentrate on patients who
will leave a surplus at the end of the day is common.</p>

<p>The Bristol model is producing its own version of this problem. As
resources are squeezed, the fundholding GP takes precedence over the
non-fundholding, traditional GP. The Tories deny this happens but a
BMA and Labour Party survey in December last year showed that &#8216;two
out of every five hospitals across the country were offering
preferential access to treatment for GP fundholders&#8217;. Even the
president of the Association of Fundholding Practices has warned that
unless extra funding is provided he would not accept patients with
learning disabilities.</p>

<p>Health is a class issue. The gap between rich and poor has grown
since the Tories came to power in 1979. The incomes of the poorest 10
percent of families have fallen by 14 percent. The incomes of the top
10 percent have risen by half again. Infant mortality for the richest
in Britain is five per 1,000 live births, for the poorest it is 11
per 1,000. Ill health affects just under 30 percent of the richest
but nearly 50 percent of the poorest.</p>

<p>The imposition of VAT on fuel will lead to an estimated extra
2,500 deaths in winter. The Department of Health&#8217;s own statistics
show that every 1 percent increase in unemployment shows an increase
of between 0.2 and 0.5 percent in prescriptions.</p>

<p>As Labour&#8217;s document on health proves, unless the causes of ill
health themselves are tackled there can never be an adequate health service.</p>

<p>In the mid-1940s, in the wake of the <em>Beveridge Report</em>, the
demand for a national health service was not just about providing
free medical care. It was about proper protection from cradle to the
grave; about prevention as much as cure; about tackling unemployment,
housing and welfare. The idea of free health care had at its centre
the need to abolish the distorting effect of profit on the quality of
people&#8217;s lives. In short it was about the need for socialism.</p>

<p>Then British capitalism was prepared to go some way in allowing a
strong element of socialisation to enter private medicine &#8211; if only
to make sure that a relatively healthy workforce, having won the war,
could now rebuild the economy. Today British capitalism neither wants
nor is able to make the kinds of concessions it made in the late
1940s. So Labour faces a more acute choice at a time when defending
and improving the NHS is more urgent than ever.</p>

<p>Yet about the only concrete thing Labour promises to do is to
abolish fundholding and abolish tax relief on private insurance. Much
of what else it has to say is concerned with generalities. It says it
will abolish waste and improve democracy. But on the vital issue of
extra cash its voice is muffled. Whether it will commit itself even
to the type of money the BMA thinks necessary, let alone the money
required to meet needs, is unclear.</p>

<p>That is not just because Labour buckles under the Tory taunts of
where is the money going to come from. It is because increasingly
Labour has accepted the priorities of the system, including the idea
that the market can be persuaded to provide. This is a retreat even
on 1945, when at least Labour was prepared to use the state to
reorder priorities.</p>

<p>Everything Labour points to as inseparable from tackling the
causes of ill health also points to the need for socialism. In its
own distorted way that was recognised in the 1940s. The fact that
nothing comparable is raised today shows how little Labour will in
effect be able to halt the offensive against the NHS.</p>

<p>It will be down to those who work in and use the service to fight.
That fight is part of the struggle for something much larger: the
creation of a genuinely free society in which no one will be
prevented from developing their potential because of lack of health care.</p>
