<strong>Victor Serge, Collected Writings on Literature and Revolution</strong><br/>

<p class="fst">[Marxism], we are told, dismisses culture, together with other
superstructural activities, like law and religion, as marginal to the
interests of the oppressed and the exploited. This crudely
deterministic account has bolstered the opposing view that culture
has no class determination, that it should be viewed as something
free-floating, with its own value system and subject only to its
internal laws of development.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, important to recover a quite different tradition
within Marxism, one that neither succumbs to a reductionist,
deterministic understanding of culture nor abandons culture to the
enemy. Foremost in that tradition is, of course, Trotsky, whose
<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/lit_revo/index.htm" target="new"><strong>Literature and Revolution</strong></a> of 1924 analysed not only cultural and literary developments of the post-revolutionary period but
provided a magnificent vision of an emancipated humanity developing a
truly human culture. The recent publication in English of Alexander
Voronsky&#8217;s writings (<strong>Art as the Cognition of Life</strong>) has
revealed how other Russian Marxists of the period developed that tradition.</p>

<p>Now we have an important collection of Victor Serge&#8217;s writings,
translated from French for the first time. Serge, who was active as
an anarchist in France and Spain before joining the Bolsheviks in
Russia and working for the Communist International in its early
years, intended these writings for a French audience. They cover much
the same ground as Trotsky but in the context of &#8216;advanced&#8217;
Western capitalism.</p>

<p>Serge&#8217;s starting point is the fate of intellectuals and culture
in the modern world. For Serge, the First World War killed off the
idea that intellectuals, including literary intellectuals, remained
the guardians of a human heritage that transcended national
boundaries. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> Most gave cover to their own side &#8211; by justifying
the use of poison gas, by justifying censorship, and by stereotyping
the enemy and its culture. Socialist intellectuals were not exempt
from this corruption: they led the Second International in its
betrayal of the working class movement and many were quick to
denounce the Russian Revolution.</p>

<p>Serge sees this history of intellectual abdication as proof that
there can be no such thing as &#8216;disembodied thought&#8217;. The
cultivation of ideas does not transcend the division between those
who labour and those who live off labour. Culture, in this broad
sense, &#8216;is only accessible to those who have the leisure, the
requisite education and the knowledge that can be acquired at
monetary expense, by those who, in one way or another, benefit from
the exploitation of crowds condemned to ignorance and
thoughtlessness&#8217; (p.&nbsp;35).</p>

<p>Serge is not ignoring intellectuals who revolted in the name of
pacifism, or freedom of opinion. He is, rather, saying that even the
bravest of &#8216;oppositional ideologies produced by the culture of the
controlling classes&#8217; cannot avoid the reality that &#8216;all thinking
&#8211; apart from that of the proletariat &#8211; serves, whatever its
twists, to justify and perpetuate the domination of capital over
labour&#8217; (p.&nbsp;36).</p>

<p>Intellectuals have to recognise, therefore, that it is not their
words, but the working class through the forcefulness of its action,
which will end the threat of war and change the world. This
recognition, Serge sees, is enormously difficult for them,
temperamentally attached as they are to the &#8216;very forms of their
thought&#8217;, &#8216;their love for a culture of which they are the
privileged captives&#8217; and &#8216;their material and moral position
within the capitalist system&#8217; (p.&nbsp;36).</p>

<p>How is proletarian thinking developed? Serge was deeply
sympathetic to the infant Soviet republic&#8217;s attempt to raise the
cultural level of the working class. If the working class was to
defend itself against both its external and internal enemies it not
only needed the physical means of survival &#8211; it needed to cleanse
itself of the muck of ages. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> Workers had therefore to have access
to culture. But what kind of culture? Clearly, culture (as Serge
showed) was always a class culture. So could a new proletarian
culture be created?</p>

<p>Proletarian culture, as theorised and practised in the USSR in the
early 1920s, is something Serge rejects. Quoting Trotsky more than
once, he argues that there can be no such thing because of the
fundamental difference between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in
realising their class aims. The bourgeoisie has had centuries to
create its culture. Long before the bourgeoisie seized power it had
the opportunity to encourage intellectual and creative activity that
reflected its needs. No such opportunity exists for the working class
because of the way it is exploited under capitalism. The working
class lacks property (including cultural property) &#8211; unlike the
bourgeoisie. Its only weapon is self-organisation. Its historic
mission is the dissolution of all property relations &#8211; unlike the
bourgeoisie, whose mission is to secure capitalist property
relations. The role of the working class is not to constitute itself
as a new ruling class (in the traditional sense) but to prepare for
the abolition of all classes &#8211; including itself. Its role is
transitional in that it leads to the creation not of a proletarian
society but of a truly human society, the creation not of proletarian
culture but of a truly human culture.</p>

<p>Serge&#8217;s objection to the theory of proletarian culture was its
ultra-radical dismissal of all past culture as non-proletarian. It
failed to recognise that workers could, and would have to, master
previous cultures to realise their historic mission. What
&#8216;proletkultists&#8217; were demanding was the creation of an artificial
culture, with themselves as its self-appointed guardians and their
monopoly over cultural production sanctioned by the party. Far from
this being an attempt to develop genuine self-expression among
workers it was a move towards foisting an artificial and sectarian
culture on them. &#8216;Consequently, as Serge pointed out, a
&#8220;proletarian literature&#8221; produced to order, with its stress on a
&#8220;correct&#8221; political line and characters drawn according to
abstract types, was a lifeless and schematic affair.&#8217;</p>

<p>Serge does appear to contradict himself on the question of
proletarian culture in a 1928 interview in which he states:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;A working class that has become conscious of itself
... does have its own ways of feeling, of understanding life, of
suffering, of laughing and of fighting; it has its way of thinking
about society, the state, the laws, work and the family; it has, in a
word, its world view and its historic mission. But until now all this
has only been expressed to a limited extent for political ends in the
class struggle. One could easily imagine a literature that expresses
this proletarian feeling about life ... A proletarian literature is
possible&#8217; (p.&nbsp;53).</p>

<p class="fst">And he qualifies his support for Trotsky&#8217;s view with the
following reservation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Like the armies of old, they will have their bards,
their storytellers, their musicians and their philosophers ... In
this historically limited sense there will be, and there already is,
a culture of the militant proletariat&#8217; (p.&nbsp;47). <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Serge may have thought that Trotsky&#8217;s polemic against
proletarian culture was too negative. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> He was also familiar with a
very different tradition in France about proletarian culture, whose
concern was with how the working class develops its own intellectual
resources to resist the culture of the ruling class and which had
nothing to do with Proletkult. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> There is a sense in which Serge
wanted to rescue this broader vision from the danger of its being
identified solely with the target of Trotsky&#8217;s polemic. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> The
ferocity of Trotsky&#8217;s attack can be explained by the specifics of
the Russian situation, where the idea that the working class should
turn its back on &#8216;alien&#8217; culture renounced the goal of a truly
human culture. Serge, with his focus on western Europe, was probably
anxious not to lose sight of how writers could be won to developing a
culture in the service of the working class (proletarian culture in
the broad sense).</p>

<p>Serge&#8217;s analysis of the challenges facing the modern writer
takes in an extremely wide and diverse range of novelists and poets &#8211;
from Walt Whitman to the surrealists. But the bulk of his writing is
devoted to examining the Russian writers (&#8216;fellow travellers&#8217;, to
adopt Trotsky&#8217;s term) who came over to the revolution and whose
works sparked a renaissance of Russian literature in the 1920s
(before Stalinism snuffed it out).</p>

<p>Like Trotsky and Voronsky, Serge asserts that literature cannot be
valued in didactic or propagandistic terms. Speaking of the novel,
Serge says that its &#8216;unique value&#8217; &#8216;comes from the fact that it
presents to man something other than political slogans or demands;
ways of feeling, coming alive in our deepest feelings, understanding
the other person and understanding ourselves, loving and becoming
passionate about it&#8217;. Moreover:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;A complete attempt to subordinate creative activity,
where a number of conscious and unconscious factors come into play,
to a rigorously conscious direction would result in an awkward
impoverishment of the work and personality. Would the book gain in
clarity of ideas what it has lost in spontaneity, human complexity,
deep sincerity, and rich contradictions?&#8217; (p.&nbsp;88).</p>

<p class="fst">However, Serge&#8217;s openness to imaginative literature does not
imply a laissez-faire attitude. He is aware that class and ideology
are always at work within literature, even if &#8216;in an indirect and
distant way, apparently loose and invisible to all but the analyst&#8217;
(p.&nbsp;88) and is also aware that formal techniques that
characterise a writer&#8217;s approach to his subject are linked to the
way class and ideology work on a writer&#8217;s subject matter.</p>

<p>Serge shows how form and class interrelate in the Russian writers
of the 1920s. They are, he points out, too young to have any roots in
the literary world of the pre-revolutionary period, while the
hardship they experienced means that they have not learnt &#8216;about
&#8220;life&#8217;s epic venture&#8221; out of old books&#8217; (p.&nbsp;173).
Consequently &#8216;present day literature shows a renewal of the
language, enriched by returning to its roots in the speech of the
masses&#8217; (p.&nbsp;174).</p>

<p>Discussing Boris Pilnyak, the best of these fellow travellers,
Serge says that it is impossible for him to use the style of a Balzac
or an Anatole France (both writers in the great realist tradition
that started in the 19th century):</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;The revolution that broke all the old social habits
also broke the all too conventional ones of literature. There is no
story line to be followed in this Russian writer. There is no &#8220;plot&#8221;
(a poor thing, a poor word!). There are no distinctive, central
personalities. There are crowds in movement &#8211; in which each is a
world, an end in itself &#8211; events which overturn, cross over, mix
up, overlap with each other, multiple lives that appear and
disappear, all rare, unique and central, since they are human, all of
them insignificant in &#8220;Russia, the snow storm, the revolution&#8221;,
for the one thing that remains and matters is the country, the
masses, the storm ...&#8217; (p.&nbsp;202).</p>

<p class="fst">To characterise Pilnyak&#8217;s fiction thus is to recognise him as in
some sense a &#8216;modernist&#8217;. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> But much as he admires Pilnyak&#8217;s
ability to capture the reality of the revolution without
sentimentality, Serge pinpoints a weakness in the very &#8216;idea of the
revolution-storm so dear to Boris Pilnyak&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Looked at from the outside by a foreign observer, the
revolution might appear to be a prodigious unleashing of elemental
forces. But if that is all it had been, it would have been limited to
a primitive jacquerie [feudal peasant rebellion] which the possessing
classes, sufficiently well organised, would in the end have been able
to get under control. It is really a matter of peasant revolution
which was well and truly created in Russia, assisted, led and
supported by the proletarian movement&#8217; (p.&nbsp;217).</p>

<p class="fst">This identification with the revolution only through its peasant
aspect (and so omitting its central working class component) is one
Serge sees as shared by many Russian writers of the 1920s &#8211; an
identification which gives their writing its strength but also poses
a challenge to how they might develop as writers.</p>

<p>Mayakovsky is a very different kind of writer. As a poet of the
city, he identifies with the urban masses, not the peasantry. But
Serge&#8217;s &#8216;literary&#8217; analysis of his vivid use of language and
his tendency to rhetorical extravagance is linked to the strengths
and weaknesses of Mayakovsky&#8217;s ideological outlook. His critique is
that his weaknesses as a poet are rooted in his &#8216;pastism&#8217;: in the
&#8216;mad individualism&#8217; that characterises the capitalist society of
the past, not the communist society of the future, where a true human
individuality will flourish. So Mayakovsky&#8217;s fondness for
hyperbole, most evident in his poem <em>One Hundred and Fifty Million</em>,
where the colossal Russian Ivan confronts the fat colossus, Woodrow
Wilson, is the antithesis of proletarian thinking and revolutionary
realism (pp.&nbsp;266&#8211;270). <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p>Serge was quite clear that literature should not toe the party
line. At the same time, however, literature was not treated as
exempt, by virtue of its artistic status, from political
intervention. Precisely because Serge took literature (and culture)
seriously as part of the struggle for the working class to advance
the interests of humanity, his literary and cultural criticism is an
attempt to lead writers towards an understanding of how they need to
absorb a new outlook on the world, that of the working class, to give
new depths to their work. His analysis, sympathetic but politically
firm, is designed to encourage them to a deeper understanding and
commitment to proletarian revolution &#8211; an understanding which will
enrich their creativity.</p>

<p>Serge&#8217;s vision is broader than the limits set by Soviet Russia
of the 1920s. He sees the same need for commitment and renewal in the
West. Serge&#8217;s argument, sketchy though it is, is not dissimilar
from Georg Luk&#225;cs&#8217;s thesis in <strong>The Historical Novel</strong> about
the decline in bourgeois thought and culture as the rise of the
working class reduces it to apologetics. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> But unlike Luk&#225;cs,
whose model of literature is too inflexibly rooted in the past, Serge
is open, but not uncritically open, to modern literature. It is
implicit in his approach that the task of literature is to explore,
in complex and rounded ways, the nature of the world. In other words,
writers should be judged for their realism &#8211; they cannot retreat
into producing self-contained, self-referential work, as certain
versions of formalist modernism would have it.</p>

<p>Serge&#8217;s call is for a literature that asked the great questions
of modern life, that was interested in the future of the world, that
understood work and the workers, that in other words had discovered
the hitherto unknown nine tenths of society &#8211; which did not limit
itself to describing the world, but now and again might think about
changing it, in a word, was active and no longer passive, would
appeal to human potentialities, and would respond to every spiritual
need instead of confining itself to amusing the rich; even
independently of the intentions of its creators, a literature of this
sort would be tremendously revolutionary. Its development from then
on would be contrary to the interests of the possessing classes (p.&nbsp;84).</p>

<p>This collection shows how revolutionaries can combine, without
crudeness, formal and political analysis in a way that both respects
literature as literature and sees it engaged with the struggle to
change the world.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h3>Notes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> Serge is, nevertheless, positive about this heritage when he
looks at the role played by Enlightenment intellectuals in
pre-revolutionary France.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f2" name="n2">2.</a> In his articles from the early 1920s, on such diverse matters
as drink, swearing, correct forms of speech and how workers should
write for newspapers, published in <strong>Problems of Everyday Life</strong>
(New York 1973), Trotsky shows just how seriously the Bolsheviks
undertook this cultural task.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f3" name="n3">3.</a> Serge wrote this for the French journal <strong>Clart&#233;</strong> in 1925,
in the heat of the debate about proletarian literature in Russia. He
quotes these, his own words, in his later <strong>Literature and
Revolution</strong> (1932).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f4" name="n4">4.</a> Serge hints as much when he writes of Trotsky&#8217;s <strong>Literature
after October</strong> that &#8216;so cruel are some words that they cut as
sharp as a lancet, and so summary are some judgements that they are
like a bludgeon&#8217; (p.&nbsp;164).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f5" name="n5">5.</a> See, for example, M. Martinet, <strong>Culture Prol&#233;tarienne</strong>
(Paris 1935).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f6" name="n6">6.</a> It is evident from early Soviet pronouncements that
&#8216;proletarian culture&#8217; was used confusingly to cover two different
definitions. It was Lenin who seems first to have demanded
clarification. See, for example, his demand in 1920 that the Central
Committee should draw up a draft resolution which promotes
proletarian culture as an educational project but rejects any idea
that this should be an attempt &#8216;to invent one&#8217;s own particular
brand of culture&#8217; &#8211; V.I. Lenin, <strong>Collected Works</strong> (Moscow
1966), p.&nbsp;317. Note, however, that Lenin continues to use the
term positively in the first sense.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f7" name="n7">7.</a> Serge is unlikely to have known the term. But Serge&#8217;s mention
of other aspects of Pilnyak&#8217;s style &#8211; for example, his
&#8216;simultaneism&#8217; and his love for &#8216;a phrase or catchphrase picked
up in the street and reproduced without explanation&#8217; (p.&nbsp;203)
&#8211; suggests that he was well aware of new developments in fiction in
the period. (Serge&#8217;s admiration for the modernist American writer
John Dos Passos is well known: see his <strong>Memoirs</strong> [Oxford 1967]
p.&nbsp;263, which interestingly links Dos Passos to Pilnyak as well as to
Serge&#8217;s own fiction.)</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f8" name="n8">8.</a> Serge&#8217;s analysis is very close to Trotsky&#8217;s (see his
<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/lit_revo/index.htm" target="new"><strong>Literature and Revolution</strong></a> [London 1991], pp.&nbsp;177&#8211;188), but both praised Mayakovsky&#8217;s tremendous talent.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f9" name="n9">9.</a> It is clear from his <strong>Memoirs</strong> that Serge was personally
acquainted with Luk&#225;cs, whom he held in &#8216;greatest esteem; indeed,
I owe him a great deal&#8217; (p.&nbsp;187), and who was &#8216;fairly well
disposed towards me&#8217; (p.&nbsp;188). This thumbnail sketch, which
also includes sharp criticism of Luk&#225;cs&#8217;s complicity with
Stalinism, is maddeningly vague about what his debt to Luk&#225;cs was:
could it have included insights into literature?</p>
