<p class="fst"><strong>Doctor Faustus</strong><br/>
by Christopher Marlowe</p>

<p class="fst">The story is a legend from the middle ages: a man sells his soul
to the devil in exchange for magical powers. In its original form the
contract is a straightforward struggle between good and evil.</p>

<p>But the story&#8217;s appeal changed with the growth of modern
society. Faust became a symbol of the aspiration to overstep the
limits laid down by traditional authority, to understand the secrets
of nature and to gain mastery over the world. Faustus is turned into
a rebel, but a rebel whose contract with dangerous powers destroys
him in the process.</p>

<p>Marlowe, writing his play in the 1580s and 1590s, was the first
modern writer to develop this side of the Faust legend. In part he is
still stuck with the medieval framework &#8211; there are good and bad
angels, real devils, magic and sorcery. But more importantly he
presents us with a character who rejects all the old authorities in
philosophy, medicine, law and theology as inadequate to what human
beings are capable of thinking and doing.</p>

<p>His pact with Mephistopheles is a chance to explore the limits of
knowledge and of the physical world. This was the age of the rebirth
of learning, of the conquest of the New World and of shattering
advances in science. Faust reflects all three. He wants to relive the
glories of the pagan world, gather together the riches of the world
and delve into the causes of things. He is a kind of glorified
Elizabethan adventurer.</p>

<p>But he is doomed &#8211; not just in the medieval sense of being
damned for all eternity with the pains of hell. He also begins to
realise that his appetite is larger than the means to satisfy it and
that the powers he summons up are not his to control. He &#8216;is like
the sorcerer, who is no longer able control the powers of the nether
world whom he has called up by his spells&#8217;, as Marx was much later
to describe the capitalist class.</p>

<p>It is this tension between aspiration and fulfilment that gives
irony to the dialogue between Faustus and Mephistopheles which
dominates the play. The devil never ceases to tell Faustus where his
ambitions will take him &#8211; and Faustus never ceases to disbelieve in
the devil until too late.</p>

<p>Staging the play always presents difficulties because it is an
uneasy mix of medieval and modern and because the text is corrupt,
some of it by a collaborator interested in injecting an element of
farce. This production cuts most of the tedious bits and settles for
a modern setting, with Faustus as a student living in a dilapidated
one bedroom flat. This ignoring of the historical dimension creates
some problems, particularly with the chorus, Faustus&#8217;s conjuring up
of the devil and the slapstick scene when Faust taunts the pope and
the cardinal (it would have appealed to the Protestant audiences of the day).</p>

<p>But the production works much better with the relationship between
Faustus and Mephistopheles, who is played magnificently as a cool and
calculating cynic. And the stage effects are superb, particularly the
parade of the Seven Deadly Sins. That alone is worth going for.</p>
<p>It is the energy and sweep of the poetry which drives the play
forward. The famous lines addressed to Helen of Troy: &#8216;Was this the
face that launched a thousand ships/And burnt the topless towers of
Ilium?/Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss,&#8217; are only one
example of Marlowe&#8217;s mighty verse to enjoy.</p>

<p>Modern society from Marlowe&#8217;s time to our own has been haunted
by the Faustian dilemma of whether the limitless growth of human
power does not involve a devil&#8217;s pact with self destruction. This
production gets something of that across. See it while you can.</p>

<p class="fst"><em><strong>Doctor Faustus</strong> is at Greenwich Theatre, London, till 11 December.</em></p>
