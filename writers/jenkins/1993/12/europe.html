<p class="fst">France hadn&#8217;t seen anything like it for years. Thousands of
angry workers at Air France burnt tyres, fought the police and shut
down the company for over a week. In the end the bitter strike in
late October both forced the government to abandon a planned layoff
of 4,000 workers at the state owned airline, and also led to the
departure of its chairman Bernard Attali.</p>

<p>As the American bosses&#8217; magazine <strong>Business Week</strong> said in November, &#8216;The Air France strike may
have done more than that... It could mark a troubling and costly
turning point for Europe. All over the Continent, workers who have
merely grumbled about snowballing layoffs and wage cuts ... suddenly
are waxing militant.&#8217;</p>

<p>Behind this strike and the other examples of a new militancy
stirring across Europe lies the worst recession since the Second
World War. With no end to the crisis in sight and no clear strategy,
weak and often divided governments are being forced into hesitant
measures to try and reduce workers&#8217; living standards and attack
wages. Workers have responded wherever governments have attacked.</p>

<p>After the Air France strike, French unions called a massive Paris
march on 18 November bringing out employees from many state owned
companies targeted for privatisation like Groupe Bull, SNECMA and
Aerospatiale. In Italy strikes are commonplace with, in the last
months, cab drivers protesting against new taxes, Turin rail workers
barricading their station and disrupting services across the breadth
of northern Italy and a four hour general strike on 28 October
involving 14 million workers.</p>

<p>In Germany too there were wildcat walkouts in mid-October in the
Ruhr steel industry, with steel workers blocking motorways to protest
at planned attacks on wages and conditions. The metal workers&#8217;
union, IG Metall, with 3.3 million members, has vowed to fight German
bosses&#8217; plans to end wage contracts without negotiation.</p>

<p>Faced with a situation where governments all over Europe are
attempting at least to push through cuts in public spending and hold
down wages, and at most attempting full blown austerity programmes,
the role of the union leaders is very important. In Spain, where
Felipe Gonzalez won a fourth general election in a row, his Socialist
Party (PSOE) has been intent on incorporating union leaders from the
main Socialist UGT union &#8211; traditional Gonzalez allies &#8211; and the
Workers&#8217; Commissions (CCOO) who were formerly Communist Party
influenced, into negotiations for a social contract.</p>

<p>Last year in Italy leaders of the biggest trade union
confederation, the CGIL, agreed to an austerity package enforcing a
wage freeze and numerous attacks on union organisation. In Britain
the TUC has consistently been key to holding back workers&#8217;
struggle. Their diffusion of the anger that exploded last October
over plans to close down the coal industry is an example.</p>

<p>But over the last few months the situation has begun to change
with increasing examples of independent rank and file activity
winning victories and forcing the union leaderships to take a more
radical stance. This is true where union organisation is strong, as
events in Britain around the Timex dispute and the UCH occupation
have demonstrated. But it is also true where union organisation is
relatively weak. A recent <strong>Financial Times</strong> report pointed out
that:</p>

<blockquote>&#8216;Weak unions are no guarantee of industrial harmony.
France ... has the lowest rate of unionisation in the OECD, but
Michel Giraud, labour minister ... says he would like to be able to
consult with stronger unions, because they would be more receptive to compromise.&#8217;</blockquote>

<p class="sm1">The general strike of 28 October was fuelled by massive anger
over cuts in pensions, education spending and funding for
transport in the wake of mass privatisation plans.</p>

<p class="sm">Unemployment is rising. The big Fiat car company is planning to
shed 20,000 jobs, the steel industry at least 12,000 and the
chemical industry is closing many plants.</p>

<p class="sm">The four hour general strike reflected both this anger and
disillusionment with the official trade union leaders.</p>

<p class="sm">They called the strike to defend the agreement they had struck
with the government last year which froze wages, attacked public
sector workers&#8217; conditions, approved tax increases and decreased
democracy inside the unions.</p>

<p class="sm">Although this was hated by most workers, many took the
opportunity to express their anger against the government.</p>

<p class="sm">Sections of the left were divided over support for the strike
and in some areas &#8211; including Milan, Turin and Genoa &#8211; Cobas,
sections of the umbrella organisation for various rank and file
movements, and the social centre movements held separate
demonstrations. In other areas they called an alternative strike
day to coincide with protests by teachers and students.</p>

<p class="sm">The left wing organisation <em>Rifondazione Comunista</em> was
also divided. Although the leadership is with the rest of the
trade union leaders, the rank and file often differ.</p>

<p class="sm">Many, especially the student membership, are drawn towards
alternative trade unions, through impatience with the conservatism
of the old leaders.</p>

<p class="sm">There is a danger with this lack of unifying leadership on the
left of the right making ground.</p>

<p class="sm">The fascist CISNAL union has been on the streets with
megaphones and leaflets talking about the government&#8217;s attacks
on pensions and calling for the return of the <em>Scala Mobile</em>,
a sliding scale wage agreement torn up by the government recently.</p>

<p class="sm">The first round of the mayoral elections showed a victory for
the left PDS, but also a dramatic rise in the fascist MSI vote.</p>

<p class="sm">The most encouraging and exciting aspect of this increasingly
volatile and unstable picture is the continued, angry and often
quite spontaneous workers&#8217; activity.</p>

<p class="sm">During the last few weeks pensioners, school students,
teachers, public sector workers and agricultural workers have all
taken to the streets.</p>

<p>As the article continues, and our eye witness reports
demonstrate, &#8216;At local level, the vacuum left by weak unions is
being filled by <em>ad hoc</em>, and often aggressive, &#8220;coordinations&#8221;
&#8211; growing fast in Italy and France.&#8217;</p>

<p>The employers need the official leaderships to help them push
through job cuts and austerity packages. The weakness and divisions
in the unions in countries such as France and Italy make it harder
for their leaders to contain the anger and bitterness that has welled up.</p>

<p>What worries the bosses deeply is that governments may be forced
to try and push through the sort of large scale austerity programmes
they hope will end the recession without the cooperation, or
influence, of the official trade unions. In both Spain and Belgium
leaders of the trade unions, under threat of protest from below, have
consistently balked at agreeing far reaching austerity packages. As
economic and political problems worsened throughout this year the
government in Italy reneged on the austerity package it agreed with
the unions in 1992, precipitating the general strike of 28 October.
Attempting large scale attacks on workers without the cooperation of
union leaders could be very risky for Europe&#8217;s ruling classes.</p>

<p>In Britain, in contrast, there has not yet been the level of
confrontation seen in Europe. One reason why is because British
Tories have not yet dared to try the all round offensive that the
French and Spanish governments have initiated in response to the
crisis. And the weight of the TUC inside the working class movement
has meant that it has so far been able to prevent the action needed
to stop attacks on workers. Apart from the one day civil service
strike involving around 200,000 civil servants all over Britain, the
struggle beginning to hit Europe has not so far been evident here.
But the TUC cannot keep the lid on indefinitely.</p>

<p>Socialists cannot be complacent about the alienation from union
leaders and official unions many workers in Europe feel. In the
absence of a strong left alternative and faced with general attacks
on their standards of living, workers can also look to the right.
Many politicians are aware of this and have courted right wing
parties and espoused right wing arguments. Chancellor Kohl&#8217;s
proposal to appoint Steffan Heitmann as President of the Republic
with his track record of racism and sexism was a conscious effort on
the German leader&#8217;s part to keep the right wing vote as he
approaches 19 federal, state and local elections in 1994.</p>

<p>This can open the way for the extreme right to grow as we have
seen most obviously in France, where Le Pen&#8217;s fascist National
Front is now well placed in local government. In Italy too, the far
right has made gains. The Northern League is a real presence in the
north, and the Norebe elections in Naples and Rome gave the open
fascists over a third of the vote.</p>

<p>But the far right has little to offer once workers begin to take
the sort of action they are taking. During the Air France strike, for
example, Le Pen, the strongest of the Eurofascists, was completely
marginalised. The workers&#8217; struggle now beginning to erupt across
the continent is the clearest sign yet that workers are not willing
to pay the cost of the recession. The confidence gained from the
victory at Air France can spread like wildfire across Europe igniting
the anger that lies waiting in workplaces and in working class
communities all over, and drive back the employers&#8217; offensives.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Fear has changed sides</h3>

<p class="fst">Talk of another May 1968 in France is more than just wishful
thinking. The strike at Air France follows a number of strikes and
demonstrations since the summer in response to the five year plan put
forward by Edouard Balladur, leader of the right wing RPR-UDF
government. The main features of this plan are that the bosses are to
have their tax burdens cut, some 21 industries are to be privatised
and there is to be a shake out of civil servants&#8217; jobs. At the same
time, workers are going to have to pay more contributions to sickness
and unemployment benefit and to pensions.</p>

<p class="sm1">The Belgian government, a coalition of Christian Democrats and
Socialists, is pursuing similar objectives to the French. The
Dehaene plan is to cut wage costs in order to improve
competitiveness. In particular it aims to worsen the rights of
young workers to holiday pay and job protection, to increase part
time work and temporary contracts, to lower wages, to make the
working year more flexible and to cut benefits.</p>

<p class="sm">The scale of this attack has forced the trade union
bureaucracies to react. The FTGB (based in the French speaking
south and linked to the Socialist Party) walked out of
negotiations and called a weekday demonstration of some 70,000
people in Brussels. The more conservative CSC (based in Flanders
and with links to the Christian Democrats) has been continuing
negotiations but, under pressure from militant sections who have
been urging the union to break away from the Christian Democrats,
is now beginning to move into action.</p>

<p class="sm">The two federations have called for joint action and a campaign
of strikes. A warning strike in November is to be followed by
rolling strikes on three successive Fridays across the ten
provinces. The climax will be a general strike across the whole
country on 10 December, when the European council meets.</p>

<p class="sm">The &#8216;warning&#8217; strike was hugely successful, particularly in
the French speaking south of the country. This has increased
tension between the coalition partners in the government, with the
markets nervous about the stability of the franc if the plan does
not go through.</p>

<p class="sm">Belgium has the highest level of unionisation in Europe. That
gives the unions enormous power. At the same time the leaders can
use these demonstrations and strikes simply to try to improve
their bargaining position. Conflict between the trade union
machines can also waste the potential.</p>

<p class="sm">But one should not conclude the trade union bureaucracies will
ensure struggle goes down to defeat. There are other struggles
hotting up in the steel and paper making industries. Mass trade
union action has shaken the ruling class to its foundations
before, as happened in the insurrectionary general strike of 1961
and the wave of strikes in 1982.</p>

<p class="sm">With the crisis in the 1990s that much deeper it does not
require much bureaucratic mass action to tip society into a crisis
in which ordinary workers can begin to take the initiative.</p>

<p class="sm1">Top German economists are in no doubt about what Germany needs
to get out of its recession. As one of the country&#8217;s so called
&#8216;five wise men&#8217;, Professor Herbert Hax, put it, &#8216;Work is
[only] in short supply at current wage rates ... We must make sure
we do not price ourselves out of the world markets.&#8217;</p>

<p class="sm">Sections of the German ruling class are calling for a more
determined government led general offensive against workers&#8217;
wages and living standards. With forecasts of no recovery before
1997 and unemployment predicted to rise to over four million by
the end of the year, bosses are increasingly worried both about
economic stagnation and social unrest as a recent report on Europe
wide unemployment made clear. Some, most notably the opposition
Social Democratic Party, are calling for the sort of social
contract in cooperation with union leaders that other countries,
such as Spain, are attempting. But this will prove very difficult
given the prospect over the next months of state, federal and
local elections, when political daggers will be drawn. In this
atmosphere consensus will be difficult to achieve.</p>

<p class="sm">More importantly, German workers have already shown themselves
willing to defend their wages and conditions with militant action,
the recent strike by steel workers being the clearest example of
this. Chancellor Kohl&#8217;s calls for belt tightening fall on deaf
ears and are more likely to stoke up resistance than convince.</p>

<p>The government is out to attack working hours, making them
more flexible. Instead of being calculated on a 39 hour week, length
of work will be calculated in relation wholly or partly to the year.
So that will allow Renault to enforce a 45 hour week in the winter
without having to pay overtime and 36 hours in the summer on short
time. The bosses can also demand weekend work and get rid of two
consecutive rest days.</p>

<p>This shake up also allows the bosses to turn full time into part
time work, enforce Sunday working for certain kinds of service jobs
and restrict trade union rights of representation. The whole package,
together with increased postal costs, fare and petrol rises, is a
massive attack on workers&#8217; income and conditions.</p>

<p>The government&#8217;s five year plan and its budget demanded
&#8216;sacrifices from all&#8217;, but the effect has been to spread the
anger to all. Ever since the end of the holidays there have been
dozens of strikes and demonstrations against the bosses and the
government, including workers in factories under threat of closure,
bank workers and underground workers in Paris and post office workers
in Toulouse who were out for four months.</p>

<p>This has forced the trade union leaderships into action, in
particular the Communist led CGT and more surprisingly the right wing
&#8216;moderate&#8217; union, FO. In late September the CGT mobilised 45,000
workers for demonstrations across France, while 35,000 railway
workers demonstrated in Paris early in October. Six days later the
combined forces of the CGT and FO called out 100,000. Sections of the
Socialist trade union, the CFDT, joined in and the CFDT itself was
compelled to call out 20,000 workers, with 30,000 teachers
demonstrating in Paris two days later.</p>

<p>Students too have been affected. In late November over 20,000
students marched through Paris protesting against the appalling
facilities in French universities. Importantly, this was the first
time since 1971 that the pro-Communist and pro-Socialist wings of the
UNEF students&#8217; union have joined forces.</p>

<p>White collar workers not normally associated with militant trade
unionism (such as bank employees and shop workers), have routinely
been involved which explains the role of the right wing union FO.</p>

<p>The strike at Air France came after 5,000 jobs had already gone
without any resistance over the last two years at the state owned
airline. The new restructuring plan of Air France boss, Bernard
Attali, anticipated a further 4,000.</p>

<p>His plans have been destroyed. What made the strike victorious was
the militant tactics and the spread of solidarity. The strike started
with the freight workers and later spread to maintenance workers.
Four thousand invaded the runways &#8211; something that had never
happened before, even in 1968. The management thought that sending in
the dreaded riot police would isolate and demoralise the strikers.
The effect was the exact opposite. The strike spread like wild fire
to other sections who might ordinarily be expected not to join in:
white collar workers, pilots and air hostesses.</p>

<p>The strikers themselves made the point that the management had
spent years dividing the workforce but that it only took a few days
of struggle to recreate solidarity in one of the most hierarchical
enterprises in Europe.</p>

<p>This kind of solidarity and militancy not only frightened the
management and government into submission. With Attali ousted the
role played by mass meetings (between 800 and 1,000 attended)
produced a rank and file confidence and independence which scared the
trade union leaders. The refusal to bow to the bureaucrats&#8217; demand
for a return to work after the government&#8217;s surrender was because
the strikers wanted the restructuring plan to be not simply suspended
but withdrawn altogether.</p>

<p>The Air France victory has upped the level of struggle generally.
Further action at the domestic subsidiary of Air France, Air Inter,
included runway invasions, sit-ins and blocking the departure lounge.
And the long running disputes at the computer manufacturer Bull and
the aluminium giant Pechiney are increasing in intensity. Elsewhere
in Europe there have been &#8216;copycat&#8217; strikes of airport workers.</p>
<p>Fear, as one Air France striker said, has changed sides. It is now
the bosses who are terrified at what their austerity plans will do. A
winter of discontent is setting in and it won&#8217;t just be France that
is affected.</p>

<p class="sm1">Following his record breaking fourth general election victory
in a row, Felipe Gonzalez has immediately moved onto the offensive.</p>

<p class="sm">Gonzalez began a purge of the remnants of the left within his
own party at the same time as he ruled out any collaboration with
the United Left. Instead, he has sought alliances with the right
wing Basque and Catalan nationalist parties in order to keep his
minority government in office. Indeed, the PSOE has moved so far
to the right that it has just recruited the former deputy leader
of the Spanish Tory party.</p>

<p class="sm">A series of economic proposals introduced include a three year
pay freeze for all public employees; encouragement to the private
sector to keep wages below 1.5 percent; new laws to make it easier
for employers to get rid of workers &#8211; including the relaxation
of the rules for redundancy pay for those with permanent
contracts; new, even tougher anti-trade union laws to weaken union
activity; and the reduction of existing pensions and new
regulations designed to make entitlement to a state pension more difficult.</p>

<p class="sm">Yet another round of privatisation is proposed, including what
is left of the state run petrochemical industry and the telephone
company. This will lead to heavy job losses.</p>

<p class="sm">However, the government cannot put through these proposals
without the cooperation of the unions and it is for this reason
that Gonzalez has resurrected the idea of a social contract
between government, unions and the Spanish CBI.</p>

<p class="sm">So strong has been union opposition to the proposals that the
government has been forced to back down on a number of the worst
elements of the &#8216;contract&#8217;, including proposals to reduce
pension rights and to cut back on unemployment benefit, which had
met with the approval of the employers. Union leaders had promised
an autumn of strife unless the proposals were dropped and, while
this is a major victory on one front, it still leaves other areas
of conflict to be resolved. Whatever the deals made by union
leaders, they will still have to sell them to their members &#8211; by
no means an easy feat, given the pressure from below and
inter-regional rivalries between union leaders themselves.</p>

<p class="sm">This pressure has been manifested most vividly in the
occupation of the SEAT factory in Barcelona which owners
Volkswagen want to close. Nationwide demonstrations and protests
over a range of issues also continue to harass the government.</p>

<p class="sm">Whether this sort of action turns into the PSOE&#8217;s &#8216;winter
of discontent&#8217;, or into a successful campaign of resistance to
government proposals, will depend very much on the levels of rank
and file pressure.</p>
