<p class="fst"><strong>The Cement Garden</strong><br/>
Dir: Andrew Birkin</p>

<p class="fst">Once upon a time, before permissiveness, there was the family. Dad
sat at the head of the table and did the outside chores. Mum sat
beside him and did the cooking. The children were well behaved. Sex
did not exist. When did this happen? If at all, the family last
occurred in the 1950s.</p>

<p>This fantasy has had a bit of an airing recently. As their world
collapses round them, the lower middle classes seek refuge in a never
never world of family values. <em>The Cement Garden</em>, closely based
on Ian McEwan&#8217;s novel, shows what monstrous perversions lurk
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>The 1950s are suggested in the film through the style of clothes
and furniture. But the house is dilapidated, a square box surrounded
by a square garden, marooned in a concrete wasteland distantly ringed
by high rise flats. Family values are already threadbare &#8211; but the
threat is not from without. It is from within. Family values
themselves are the source of all perversions.</p>

<p>Children are taught to play their proper roles, with father and
mother as models. But when Dad dies of a heart attack, while
cementing over the garden, and Mum gradually fades away, the role
playing can become a bit too literal.</p>

<p>Abnormality flourishes in this thoroughly internalised world. The
younger brother, Tom, is dressed up as a girl as part of a game of
mummies and daddies. Jack and Julie, the eldest, adolescent children,
play the parts of father and mother &#8211; but not necessarily in the
&#8216;correct&#8217; order. Jack, with his long hair, moods and narcissism,
is much closer to being a &#8216;woman&#8217; than his sister, who takes on
the responsibility of running things and so of being a &#8216;man&#8217;.</p>

<p>Above all, keeping things within the family makes the consolation
of sex a source of guilt and confusion. Jack slopes off to the toilet
for a wank instead of helping his Dad cement the garden and so is
&#8216;responsible&#8217; for his Dad&#8217;s death. Mum tells him that doing
&#8216;that&#8217; is the equivalent of losing two pints of blood. When she
dies peacefully in her bed, having long abandoned any attempt to get
out of the house, he preserves her at home &#8211; in concrete in the cellar.</p>

<p>This then becomes the family secret, protecting the home against
outside intruders, including Julie&#8217;s flashy, mature, businessman
boyfriend. And in inheriting the roles of father and mother looking
after the household, Jack and Julie also inherit their sexual roles.
Incest is the ultimate in keeping the family together.</p>

<p><em>The Cement Garden</em> is not exactly a jolly little film, but
it is compelling viewing. In its cool, detached way, it is a splendid
satire on family values.</p>

<p>Far from being the squeaky clean world of morality and purity, the
family is portrayed as a putrefying mass of perversion, which no
amount of cement can keep from cracking open.</p>

<p>As they consummate their incestuous relationship, Jack and Julie
recognise that it is a fantasy to suppose they can exist in some
changeless world outside time. That recognition is a kind of death in
itself. They lie completely still in their parents&#8217; bed,
illuminated by the flashing blue light of a police car.</p>

<p>Gripping though the film is in its claustrophobic intensity, it
leaves you with a problem. It too is caught up in seeing society as
nothing more than the family and outsiders. The only alternatives to
the hotbed of family perversion are a pre-Thatcherite businessman and
the state he calls in. Of course, the nature of the film prevents
these two from being anything more than ciphers. But it is difficult
not to worry whether these rather nastier horrors are let off too lightly.</p>

<p>As a satire against Tory fantasies about family values the film is
devastating. But it is a satire on a road to nowhere.</p>
