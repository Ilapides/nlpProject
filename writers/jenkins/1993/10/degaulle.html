<p class="fst"><strong>The Republic of de Gaulle</strong><br/>
Serge Berstein<br/>
<em>Cambridge University Press &#163;30</em></p>

<p class="fst">General de Gaulle came to power in June 1958 because the French
Fourth Republic could not solve the Algerian question.</p>

<p>His authority rested on his past reputation and the fact that he
was an outsider to the discredited political establishment.</p>

<p>Now he was being recalled to his destiny, as the Gaullist myth had
it. De Gaulle exploited his mystique to impose a new constitution
which downgraded parliament and turned the hitherto largely
ceremonial office of president into a position of real power.</p>

<p>De Gaulle masked his authoritarianism by manipulating universal
suffrage. He got away with this because he imposed solutions which
French capitalism as a whole needed but which no fraction of the
ruling class had the confidence or support to bring about.</p>

<p>The first and most pressing problem was Algeria. De Gaulle played
to both ends of the spectrum. To the far right he let it be known he
championed an Algeria which would remain French. To the centre and
left he let it be known that the present colonial arrangements would
have to go.</p>

<p>De Gaulle tamed the army apart from a few extreme right wing
diehards he then smashed. He realised that whatever his personal
sympathies Algeria would have to be given its independence.</p>

<p>With the Algerian question out of the way by July 1962, de Gaulle
was well on the way to solving the problems of France&#8217;s place in
the international economy. Traditionally France had been a mainly
agricultural country, dominated by the small producer and reliant on
protectionist tariffs. The key was rapid modernisation of the economy
via the state.</p>

<p>The postwar Fourth Republic had begun this process of
modernisation. But its political structure acted as a brake.</p>

<p>The concentration of power in de Gaulle removed these constraints.
Economic planning was streamlined to create semi-monopolies (both
private and public) in key sectors like steel, aviation, chemicals
and cars. The currency system was reformed. Protective tariffs were abolished.</p>

<p>Though the working class bore the brunt of the costs of
modernisation, it took some time to become a real threat to the regime.</p>

<p>Partly this was because the composition of the working class
changed. But it was also because the left itself was in trouble. The
Communist Party was on the defensive from the fallout over the 1956
Russian invasion of Hungary. Its opposition to de Gaulle was blunted.</p>

<p>The reformists were still demoralised by the role they had played
in the Fourth Republic and like their counterparts elsewhere
mesmerised by the apparent ability of modern capitalism to overcome crisis.</p>

<p>The author of this book tends to accept the idea that France was
so transformed under de Gaulle that the working class became marginal.</p>

<p>So for him May 1968, with its ten million strong movement of
strikes and factory occupations, was not a reminder that the working
class was alive and kicking. Rather it is to be explained by the
inability of society to cope with the new aspirations it had
fostered. It could not be a &#8216;working class revolt&#8217; in the Marxist
sense because it bypassed the CP and the trade unions.</p>

<p>De Gaulle survived the revolt but departed the next year. The
ruling class had discovered that the advantages of the Fifth Republic
now outweighed the advantages of de Gaulle himself.</p>
