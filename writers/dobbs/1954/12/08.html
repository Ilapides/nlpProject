<p class="fst">Dear Burns [Healy],</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="cap">W</span>e have just concluded a most
fruitful convention which gave an inspiring demonstration of high
morale in the ranks despite the witch-hunt pressures and from which the
party emerged with a class-struggle line realistically applied to the
present conditions.</p>


<p>A redraft of the political resolution, prepared after the recent
national elections, will be sent to you under separate cover. The
convention adopted the general line of the redraft as definitive in
determining the line of the press and the policy in branch activities.
However, the redraft will now be submitted, with some editing to
further discussion in the party, after which the Plenum of the NC will
adopt a final definitive draft by authorization of the convention.</p>


<p>The convention formally expelled the splitters and unanimously
approved the Open Letter published by the Nov. 1953 Plenum as well as
the subsequent general course of the leadership in the struggle against
Pabloism. In a discussion among the leading comrades right after the
convention, we took up the current problems in that struggle and
decided to send this letter to you personally setting forth our general
views.</p>


<p>Looking back upon recent events we now feel we made a mistake in
orienting toward establishment of a parity commission with the
Pabloites no matter on how limited a basis. Illusions can be created
that become an obstacle to the realization of our fundamental
objectives.</p>


<p>Beginning with the <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/ibt/ibt01.htm" target="_blank" >Open
Letter</a>, the forces rallied around the International Committee have
denounced Pabloism as a revisionist-liquidationist tendency guilty of:
junking the Transitional Program; renouncing the inevitability of
political revolution against the Stalinist bureaucracy and visualizing
its self-reform; covering up Stalinist betrayals; adopting a
conciliatory attitude toward alien political tendencies generally;
liquidating the movement through &#8220;deep&#8221; entry tactics; organizing a
secret personal faction; suppressing democratic discussion inside the
movement; gagging leading comrades in the executive bodies and in the
sections; carrying through minority-provoked splits and bureaucratic
expulsions&#8212;all as part of a conspiracy to achieve these
revisionist-liquidationist aims through a minority coup d&#8217;etat at a
rump congress.</p>


<p>The Open Letter and then the International Committee itself added to
this general denunciation the demand that the Pabloite usurpers be
removed from the central apparatus in order to restore internal
democracy in the world movement. Full democratic discussion was called
for on all issues in dispute before the necessary decisions are made at
a democratically organized congress.</p>


<p>It is on this line that the major sections have been rallied around
the International Committee with the consistent demand that Pablo and
Pabloism must go. The split with Pabloism is therefore already
definitive and what remains is a mopping-up operation to save whatever
confused elements we can, accepting unity only with those elements who
are prepared to break definitively with everything Pabloism stands for.
Thus, in the most basic sense the problem is not one of unification.
Our task is to consolidate the forces that have broken with Pablo and
carry the split deeper into the Pabloite ranks.</p>



<p>Organization of a common congress with the Pabloites is not in any
sense a task of the parity commission. We agreed to the commission in
the first place only to help the Ceylonese comrades find a tactical
bridge toward full support of the Trotskyist forces. We had no idea of
a congress of any kind until the groundwork has been fully laid for its
complete rejection of Pabloism and the projection of a Trotskyist
perspective. Consequently there can be no basis for discussion with the
Pabloites of any organizational matters or any questions of formal
authority.</p>


<p>At most the parity commission could merely organize a discussion and
it isn&#8217;t actually needed even for that. Our task is precisely the one
defined at the latest meeting of the IC&#8212;to pass immediately to the
preparation of our own documents for the Fourth Congress. In doing so
we will naturally run our own discussion and the documents the IC
finally elaborates through its own discussion will definitely be the
authentic documents of the Fourth Congress.</p>


<p>The notion of a parity commission serves at most as simply a device
for marking time before the definitive split with Pabloism is made
openly in the fullest formal sense. Time is on our side in the task of
clarifying the confused and hesitant elements who remain identified to
some degree with the Pabloite formal structure. The gratifying
developments you report in Germany and Italy underline this fact. But
we must be careful not to feed any illusions among the Ceylonese,
Germans, Italians or others that there can be any long cohabitation
with the Pabloites. These comrades must not get the idea that they can
avoid a clean break with Pabloism with the expectation that we will be
coming back into the old setup on the basis of a modus vivendi with
Pablo.</p>


<p>If our approach to the parity commission question gives any wrong
impressions on this score it would impede the full mobilization of the
real Trotskyist forces. Judging from the eagerness with which the
Pabloites are pushing for a quick session of the commission, they sense
this very fact and are anxious to use the parity commission device to
sow new confusion and promote new illusions. We therefore think it
necessary to slow down a great deal on the commission action and stall
off even a preliminary meeting indefinitely while we take plenty of
time to work out our own perspectives and fully develop our own
strategic and tactical course. Since the parity commission must in any
case be strictly limited to the exchange of discussion material and
nothing more, there is no need for haste in arranging a meeting and
plenty of good reasons that can be advanced for delaying it.</p>


<p>Our platform permits no common executive body with the Pabloites. It
requires just the opposite since our stress is on the consolidation of
the Trotskyist forces and a definitive separation from Pabloism. Hence
nothing of an executive character gives any urgency to a parity
commis-sion meeting. Our documents will not be designed for &#8220;common&#8221;
discussion with the Pabloites but for clarification of the Trotskyists
and the elaboration of the Trotskyist platform. We have nothing to
negotiate with the Pabloites concerning the character and scope of
discussion material. In fact we take a dubious view even of the
proposed IC demand to have our own spokesmen in Pablo-dominated
sections. That stipulation would work both ways and we don&#8217;t really
need it, certainly not nearly as much as the Pabloites do. Thus all the
parity commission can really do is exchange documents and there would
be no point to a hasty meeting merely to agree that this would be done
later on. And the IC will not be in a position to submit any documents
to a parity commission until they have been thoroughly discussed among
the IC supporters and approved by them.</p>


<p>We fully agree with the decision of the International Committee to
concentrate now on the preparation of the basic discussion material
intended to fully clarify our own forces and rally the confused
elements to our side. We will undertake the drafting of a document on
&#8220;World Perspectives&#8221; as the IC has requested but it will not be
possible for us to promise it by Dec. 30 as suggested. While we have no
intention of delaying the project, we do think it important that we be
allowed whatever time will be found necessary to do a workman-like job
on the draft. If you agree with us that there is no need for a forced
pace in preparing the IC documents, we assume you will also agree to
our undertaking the assignment on a necessarily elastic time schedule.</p>


<p>In addition to the discussion material already projected by the IC
we believe a thorough analysis of the structure and functioning of the
world movement along realistic democratic-centralist lines will be
needed. In the so-called &#8220;unity&#8221; resolution of the rump congress, Pablo
still harps on his pet theme of a &#8220;centralized world party.&#8221; We must
spell out not only our rejection of Pablo&#8217;s false organizational line
but also what we want the organizational norms to be as required by the
realities of the movement. Considerable discussion will first be
required among ourselves on this general subject and we plan to write
further about it later on.</p>


<p>We shall look forward to further direct consultation with you on the
points we have raised in this letter and on the manner in which these
views should be introduced among our co-thinkers.</p>
