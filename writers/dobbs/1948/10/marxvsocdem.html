<p class="fst"><em>A notable feature of the debate between Farrell
Dobbs and Norman Thomas was that it brought out strikingly to what
extent the thinking of the Social Democracy, in the person of Norman
Thomas, had drifted to the right, becoming virtually indistinguishable
from middle-class liberalism. In their past debates with revolutionary
Marxists, Social Democrats have customarily placed the main stress on
their &#8220;agreement&#8221; as to the</em>  goal 
<em>of socialism but their disagreement as to the</em> means <em>of
attaining this goal, putting forth gradualism or the patching up of
bankrupt capitalism as the most effective and &#8220;economical&#8221; way of
gaining socialism. Norman Thomas dropped all this. He was frankly
pessimistic about the working class, not only discarding all talk about
attaining socialism but openly flaunting the Marxist doctrine.
Especially noteworthy was Thomas&#8217; open acknowledgment of his betrayal
of his pledge to oppose World War II. He also avowed his determination
to stay in the camp of the war-mongers and support not only the next
war when it breaks out but the actual preparations for it, especially
those already undertaken under the cover of the Marshall &#8220;Aid&#8221; Program.
In this connection Farrell Dobbs succeeded in exposing and smoking out
Thomas completely. &#8212; Ed.</em></p>


<p class="c">* * *</p>


<p class="fst">Comrade Chairman, Comrades and Friends, The question we
are debating today &#8212; &#8220;Which Program Will Lead to a Socialist America?&#8221;
&#8212; is not a new one. We are actually dealing here with a century-old
struggle waged by the adherents of scientific socialism against all
pretenders who have advocated, under a socialist label, programs and
theories that have nothing in common with socialism. This struggle has
been in progress since the. day the <strong>Communist Manifesto</strong>
of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels was first published in 1848.</p>



<p>Seen in this light, the only correct one, it is easy to understand
that the issues in this debate go far beyond mere rivalries in an
election campaign, whose immediate outcome will settle nothing
fundamental. Let me pose these basic questions:</p>


<p>Why has the bankrupt system of capitalism survived? Why has the
Russian Revolution degenerated? Why has the scourge of fascism
lacerated mankind? Why have the devastations of one world war been
followed by another, with a third and more terrible war in open
preparation?</p>


<p>There is only one answer to these questions, and it has been given
by history: Bankrupt capitalism has survived beyond its time, and
inflicted untold evil on the world, primarily because of the betrayal
of the program and principles of socialism by those who pretended to
speak in its name.</p>


<p>The imperialists were able to dragoon the socialist working class of
Europe into the First World War in 1914 thanks only to the betrayal of
the Social-Democratic leaders. For years they had spoken in the name of
socialism, but when the decisive test of war came they acted as agents
of capitalism. For years before the outbreak of war they had preached
international working-class solidarity and threatened revolutionary
action in case of war. But when the war broke out they forgot their
promises and supported the war of the imperialists. They set the
pattern in World War I which Norman Thomas followed in World War II.
The great Russian Revolution of 1917 was led by real socialists, honest
disciples of Marx, who had fought capitalism in war as in peace. Lenin
and Trotsky hoped to extend the revolution to Germany and then to the
other European countries, and establish the Socialist United States of
Europe.</p>


<p>That would have sounded the death knell of capitalism, and it was
entirely possible. The war-tortured masses of Europe had been raised to
their feet by the Russian Revolution and were ready for the great
transformation.</p>


<p>But here again the pseudo-socialists, who controlled the great
Social-Democratic parties and trade unions, intervened to play their
tragic role of deception, sabotage and betrayal. They continued to
preach socialism in words, but in practice they placed themselves at
the service of the capitalist class and its regime. The
Social-Democratic leaders saved tottering capitalism, and took over the
responsibility of government when the capitalists were no longer able
to rule in their own name.</p>


<p>When Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg worked to pave the way for
the socialist solution in Germany in 1918 and early 1919, they were
murdered at the instigation of the self-proclaimed socialists
Scheidemann and Noske, who were in power at that time in Germany under
the &#8220;socialist&#8221; President Ebert.</p>


<p>By their policies, by their actions, the Social Democrats helped to
drag mankind to the edge of the abyss. It was this ruthless crushing of
the German socialist revolution that opened the road to Hitler and
enabled Stalinism to rise in Russia.</p>


<p>Stalinism is not an aggressive crusading force for international
workers revolution, as the American imperialists falsely and cunningly
represent it, and as some victims of their propaganda mistakenly
understand it. On the contrary, Stalinism is a a timid, cowardly,
national reformist movement which began with the repudiation of
revolutionary internationalism and thereby broke fundamentally with the
doctrines and the tradition of Bolshevism. That is the real reason for
the purges. The Stalinists had to massacre a whole generation of
revolutionary internationalists to achieve their aims.</p>



<p>Stalinism is a new variety of reformism which has nothing in common
with the revolutionary internationalism of the Bolsheviks. But at
bottom, Stalinism has very much in common with the reformist Social
Democrats.</p>


<p>It is not an accident or a misunderstanding that the Stalinists have
consistently and unceasingly fought the Marxist internationalists, the
Trotskyists, with every weapon from frame-up and slander to mass murder
and individual assassination, while they have frequently collaborated
in the most intimate manner with the reformist socialists of the
Social-Democratic camp in all countries of the world, including the
United States.</p>


<p>Of course, Stalinism and Social Democracy are not identical. There
is a fierce rivalry between them for control of the labor movement. But
it is the rivalry of bureaucratic cliques and not the rivalry of
irreconcilable ideological opponents. They are both reformists to the
marrow of their bones. They both fear and hate the proletarian
revolution above everything else, and never hesitate to unite against
it as they did in Spain and France in 1936 and the subsequent years.
And they never cease to hound and slander the Trotskyists, precisely
because the Trotskyists are the consistent and uncompromising advocates
of the workers revolution.</p>


<p>The prolonged survival of capitalism, with all its frightful
consequences, is due primarily to the influence and the treacherous
work of these two reformist currents in the labor movement, one falsely
calling itself &#8220;socialist,&#8221; and the other &#8220;communist.&#8221; All the might of
American imperialism could not save international capitalism, nor save
itself, without their aid.</p>


<p>Consider the situation throughout the world for the last 34 years.</p>


<p>We have witnessed the complete bankruptcy of capitalism as a social
system, above all in Europe. The working people of Europe showed
themselves eager to find the socialist solution. Despite deceit and
treachery, the European proletariat fought over and over, again, in one
country after another, to put an end to decaying capitalism and to
establish a socialist order.</p>


<p>But in every crisis, whenever the capitalists were no longer able to
rule in their own name, they turned to the so-called socialists and to
the reformist labor parties &#8212; alone, or in combination with the
Stalinists &#8212; to save their rule.</p>


<p>A similar situation is again unfolding in Europe today. The British
Labor Party is working with might and main to prop up senile British
imperialism, thereby only paving the way for a return of reaction. The
decrepit French empire was saved after World War II by a coalition of
Stalinists and reformist Socialists, thereby paving the way for the
coming of General de Gaulle to power. And that can mean nothing else
than the establishment of a military-police state which will attempt to
crush all workers organizations with the economic and military help of
American imperialism. It was likewise a coalition of Stalinists and
Socialists that salvaged Italian capitalism, only to be booted cut of
office when their services were no longer needed.</p>


<p>These are the bitter fruits of opportunism and class collaboration
policies, practiced with equal vileness by Social Democrats and
Stalinists.</p>



<p>We of the Socialist Workers Party have nothing to do with these
brands of so-called &#8220;socialism&#8221; or &#8220;communism.&#8221; We are orthodox
Marxists, because we know that Marxism is the only <em>revolutionary</em>
socialism of the working class, and that is the only <em>genuine</em>
socialism. History has demonstrated the spuriousness of every other
brand.</p>


<p>Marxism is a theory of social evolution which affirms that
capitalism is obsolete and bankrupt, and that it must be, and
inevitably will be, replaced by a higher form of social organization
which Marx and Engels called socialism, or communism.</p>


<p>Marxism teaches that socialism will not fall from the skies. Neither
will it be gained by any appeals to the good will and compassion of the
capitalist exploiters, as the Utopians, who preceded Marx, used to
think, and as some people still seem to think.</p>


<p>Socialism can be realized only as the outcome of the class struggle
of the workers.</p>


<p>The <strong>Communist Manifesto</strong> of Marx and Engels, in
which the principles of scientific socialism were first proclaimed to
the world 100 years ago, begins with the words: &#8220;The history of all
hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.&#8221;</p>



<p>The class struggle is the motive force of history. Politics has no
serious meaning except as the expression of conflicting class
interests. Marx and Engels asserted, and we repeat after them, that
there is an irreconcilable conflict of class interests between the
workers and their capitalist exploiters. The political program of a
working-class party must be determined accordingly.</p>


<p>All the political actions and judgments of a workers party must
always be directed against the capitalist class, and never be taken in
collaboration with them. The class struggle is the central and
governing principle of socialist politics. It is by carrying the class
struggle to its necessary conclusion &#8212; that is, to the victory of the
working class and the abolition of capitalism &#8212; that the socialist
society will be realized. This is the teaching of Marxism. There is no
other way.</p>


<p>And every attempt to find another way, by supporting the
capitalists, by conciliating them, by collaborating with them, in peace
or in war, has led not toward the socialist goal but to defeat and
disaster for the workers.</p>


<p>&#8220;Whenever revolutionary socialists discuss the socialist road for
their own country, they talk in terms of a worldwide struggle. This is
especially necessary today when we discuss &#8220;Which Program Will Lead to
a Socialist America?&#8221; Involved is not only America but the entire
world. For everybody knows that American monopoly capitalism is the
main bulwark, one might even say the only bulwark, of tottering
capitalism the world over.</p>


<p>The tyrannical Greek monarchy, the moth-eaten British empire, the
paralytic French regime, the Vatican government in Italy, the puppet
regime of the Japanese Mikado, the corrupt and bloody dictatorship of
Chiang Kai-shek in China &#8212; all of them would have crumbled into dust
long ago, were it not for American support.</p>


<p>Let me add, that the monstrous Stalinist regime of police
oppression, forced labor and bloody purges could never survive the
American socialist revolution.</p>


<p>This role of American imperialism as the main powerhouse of world
reaction places tremendous responsibilities on American socialists.
Among these is the responsibility to learn from the lessons of the
terrible defeats of the European working class, and to teach these
lessons to the American workers. This is what we Trotskyists are trying
to do.<br>
&nbsp;</p>


<h4>Bourgeois Liberation Versus Marxism</h4>

<p class="fst">The American working class, so powerful in its trade
union organizations, is on the verge of a great political awakening.
All the more incumbent is it upon socialists, or those who want to be
socialists, to educate this working class in the true program of
socialism. And that is the program of Marx and Engels, of Lenin and
Trotsky.</p>


<p>There can be no greater crime than to miseducate or deceive this
working class upon whom so much depends for the salvation of mankind.
It is a crime to offer them a program of middle-class liberalism under
the label of socialism. That is essentially what the program, and even
more the practice, of Norman Thomas and the Socialist Party sums up to.</p>


<p>Some 12 years ago there was a glimmer of promise that the Socialist
Party would once again become a potent factor in the class struggle of
the workers for socialism. Those were the days when the Old Guard gang
of conservative and contented bureaucrats broke with the Socialist
Party and founded the Social Democratic Federation. Those were the days
of revolutionary-sounding resolutions against war and capitalism, when
revolutionists were invited to come into the party. That promise didn&#8217;t
last very long.</p>


<p>The approach of war made it clear that the brave words of the party
resolutions would soon be put to the test, and Thomas and the group
around him shrank from the test.</p>


<p>The split with the Old Guard had taken place precisely over the
anti-war resolution. But Thomas and the others, who reject the
socialism of Marxism, the socialism of the class struggle in war as in
peace, turned against the revolutionists who remained true to the
struggle against imperialist war and again sought unity with the Old
Guard war-mongers.</p>


<p>The Socialist Party, as represented by the heroic, fearless
revolutionary socialist, Eugene V. Debs, has changed its character
beyond recognition under the leadership of Norman Thomas. The
middle-class liberalism of war-supporting Norman Thomas has no more in
common with the militant socialism of the anti-war fighter Debs than
Stalinism has in common with the Bolshevik Party of Lenin. The
Socialist Party today represents not a continuation of Debs&#8217; tradition
but a complete break with this tradition.</p>


<p>Trotsky once said that Norman Thomas calls himself a socialist as a
result of a misunderstanding on his part. Trotsky did not mean this
remark as a personal insult, but simply as a reference to the fact that
by rejecting Marxism and the class struggle as the guiding line of
politics, he could not carry on a consistent struggle against the
capitalist rulers and their government.</p>


<p>This remark was made in 1940, a year before America entered the war.
The evolution of Socialist Party policy since that time under the
guidance of Thomas has amply demonstrated the correctness of Trotsky&#8217;s
appraisal.</p>


<p>Ever since America entered the war, for profit and plunder, in
December 1941, Thomas has found himself in fundamental agreement with
the United States State Department on all the fundamental questions of
foreign policy while critical on secondary points.</p>



<p>Henry Wallace, whom we oppose just as Thomas does but for opposite
reasons &#8212; Thomas criticizes Wallace because he is friendly with the
Stalinists; we say the Stalinists have once again betrayed the workers
by supporting the capitalist politician Wallace &#8212; Wallace didn&#8217;t miss
the mark very far the other day when he characterized Thomas as a.
fellow-traveler of the bipartisan foreign policy of the
Republican-Democratic coalition.</p>


<p>To make that characterization more precise and accurate, I would add
that he is a critical fellow-traveler of this imperialist foreign
policy, but a fellow-traveler just the same. He supports all their
major decisions and invariably limits his criticisms to methods of
executing them and similar secondary matters.</p>


<p>He supported the war of the American imperialists but insisted that
they conduct it as humanely as possible. Consider his comment on the
dropping of the atomic bomb on defenseless Hiroshima, the most terrible
atrocity in the history of the human race.</p>


<p>When this Japanese city and its doomed population were blasted into
atomic dust, Norman Thomas wrote in the <strong>Socialist Call</strong>,
August 20, 1945: &#8220;Certainly that bomb should not have been dropped on a
crowded city without warning.&#8221;</p>


<p>Not without warning! Such humanitarianism is on the same plane as
criticizing an assassin because he has failed to inquire about his
victim&#8217;s health before plunging a dagger into his heart.</p>


<p>The so-called socialism of Norman Thomas and the Socialist Party
turns out in practice to be nothing but critical support of American
imperialism. The capitalist rulers understand that very well. That&#8217;s
why they have such a benevolent attitude toward him and give him so
much free and friendly publicity in their press.</p>


<p>The Socialist Workers Party is an irreconcilable opponent of
American imperialism. They understand that too. That&#8217;s why they
persecute and prosecute us. And even deprive a legless veteran, James
Kutcher of Newark, New Jersey, of the right to make a living as a
clerical worker for the simple reason that he is a member of the
Socialist Workers Party.</p>


<p>It is true that the Stalinists derive their policy directly from the
Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union and sell out the interests of
the American working class every time, in response to every twist and
turn of Stalinist diplomacy. That&#8217;s why we are the irreconcilable
opponents of the Stalinists and their so-called &#8220;communism.&#8221;</p>



<p>But it is equally true that Norman Thomas derives his basic policies
from the American State Department, as shown by his support of the
imperialist war from 1941 to 1945 and his present support of the
Marshall Plan which is nothing but the program of preparation for
another world war. That&#8217;s why we are irreconcilable opponents of Norman
Thomas and his so-called &#8220;socialism.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;</p>


<h4>Our Program</h4>
<p class="fst">In contrast to the Socialist Party and the Stalinists,
the Socialist Workers Party pursues on all questions, especially the
war question, a policy independent of both the Kremlin and Washington.
Our policy is designed to serve the interests of the working people and
not of their masters or bureaucratic betrayers.</p>


<p>Our Election Platform demands the taking of the war-making powers
out of the hands of Congress. We are opposed to all secret diplomacy.
We stand for the withdrawal of all troops from foreign soil. We demand
the complete independence of the colonial peoples. We place no
confidence whatever in the United Nations, or in the Marshall Plan, or
the Baruch Plan, or any other plan, scheme or subterfuge designed to
cover and promote the predatory aims of American imperialism.</p>


<p>Our program, for war as for peace, is summed up in two fundamental
propositions which proceed from the principle of the class struggle as
the guiding line of working-class politics.</p>


<ol>
<li>No support whatever to the government of the capitalists in war
or in peace.</li>
<li>In place of the capitalist government which rules America and
seeks to rule the whole world and seeks to dominate the peoples of the
entire world &#8212; in the interests of a small minority &#8212; we advocate a
government of workers and farmers which would rule in the name and the
interests of the immense majority at home and offer peace and
friendship to all the peoples of the world.<br>
&nbsp;</li>

</ol>
<h4>The War Question</h4>
<p class="fst">The question of war, in which all questions of socialism
are concentrated, now has a burning urgency for all the people
everywhere who live in dread of the terrible things in preparation, in
these twilight days of the long-outlived and utterly reactionary
capitalist system.</p>


<p>What hope can we ever have of socialism, or even of the preservation
of the remnants of democracy, or even of the salvation of the human
race, if we don&#8217;t resolutely oppose the endless wars which capitalism
inflicts upon mankind?</p>


<p>I wish to put this burning question before you now as the central
and decisive issue of our discussion, as it is the center of all
discussions taking place throughout the world. I will begin by asking
Norman Thomas not <em>what</em> he is doing, but why?</p>


<p>I ask him point-blank to explain to this audience why he betrayed
his promise to oppose the Second World War.</p>


<p>I ask him to explain why he supports the present bipartisan foreign
policy of the United States government, which is nothing but a sinister
preparation for a Third World War, that threatens the life of the whole
human race on this planet.</p>


<p>I want to ask him to explain to this audience why he is doing that,
and how he reconciles it with the principles and traditions of
socialism.</p>



<p>It is not necessary for me to ask Norman Thomas what position he is
going to take in the impending war. You and I already know. His whole
course shows that he is going to support the same American imperialist
gang that he supported in the last war. This time for the domination
and enslavement of the world by the most bloodthirsty enemies of the
human race, whose twin headquarters are Wall Street and Washington.</p>


<p>And it is not necessary to ask <em>us</em> where the Socialist
Workers Party will stand. We proved in the last war, not without risks
and sacrifices, that we are opposed to this imperialist gang in war as
well as in peace, as every genuine socialist must be.</p>


<p>The war which the cold-blooded financiers and militarists are
preparing will be a war of aggression by American imperialism for the
domination and enslavement of the whole world. Irreconcilable
opposition to this projected war will be a defense of the human race.
We take our position in this defense for the life and freedom and
independence of mankind. And no one worthy of the name of socialist can
do otherwise.</p>


<p>One of the aims of this war for the conquest of the world, by
reducing a few hundred cities and a few hundred million people to
atomic ashes, will be the conquest of the Soviet  Union, the
overthrow of its system of nationalized economy and planned production,
its dismemberment and reduction to colonial status, the reestablishment
of the rule of capitalists and landlords under a fascist regime serving
as the agents of the American imperialist overlords and sharing their
blood-drenched profits with them.</p>


<p>An essential part of the war program of American imperialism will be
the cementing of alliances with the most reactionary elements in all
countries against their own people.</p>


<p>In the period of preparation of this third war for so-called
&#8220;democracy&#8221; we already see in the first line the reactionary,
authoritarian Vatican and its army of priestly enemies of human freedom
throughout the world; the ecclesiastical vultures who blessed the
dictator-murderer, Mussolini, and sprinkled holy water over the head of
the butcher Franco.</p>



<p>Reaching its foreign tentacles into this country, our &#8220;democratic&#8221;
ally, the Vatican, has only recently given us a demonstration of its
love for free speech and democracy by instigating the exclusion of the
liberal <strong>Nation</strong> from the public schools of Newark and
New York; by working night and day to undermine and destroy the
American public school system; and by uniting and organizing all
reactionary forces in the trade unions &#8212; through the instrument of the
priest-controlled &#8220;Association of Catholic Trade Unionists&#8221; &#8212; to drive
out all militant unionists.</p>


<p>Those who wish to enter this so-called &#8220;democratic&#8221; coalition for
the Third World War must begin by kneeling to the Pope, for he is the
first and most powerful ally of the American State Department.</p>


<p>Those who support the coming war for so-called &#8220;democracy&#8221; under
American leadership must shake hands in friendship and smoke the pipe
of peace with all the dethroned monarchs who have found ready asylum in
America and England in flight from the wrath of their own people; and
the King of Greece who is supported on his bloody throne by American
money, arms and generals.</p>


<p>They must shake the blood-stained hand of the dictator Chiang
Kai-shek; unite with the reactionary feudal gang in Turkey, and with de
Gaulle, the American candidate for military dictator of France.</p>


<p>And finally, gagging and protesting, but going along just the same,
they must accept the partnership of Franco, who will soon be rebaptized
as a &#8220;democrat&#8221; and furnished with American arms and money for his part
in the holy war for &#8220;democracy&#8221; and &#8220;freedom&#8221; and the &#8220;rights of man,&#8221;
and the sacred profits of American financiers.</p>


<p>The Socialist Workers Party will not go along with this alliance. It
is madness! It is a conspiracy against humanity! And it will not
succeed! The threatened peoples of the world will never consent to
become the colonial slaves of Wall Street.</p>


<p>And the American working class &#8212; the greatest social power in the
world &#8212; will soon discover that they are marked as the first victims of
this imperialist war against humanity, and they will rise up against it.</p>



<p>The alliance of the American imperialists with all the reactionary,
privilege-seeking elements throughout the world is a great and fearsome
power. But the alliance of the great American working class with the
oppressed and freedom-seeking peoples of the world is a still mightier
power. And in the end it will prevail.</p>


<p>The victory of this alliance will bring peace and socialism to the
world.</p>


<p>The Socialist Workers Party will fight in this alliance and for this
victory at all costs and with all its strength.</p>
