<h4>Att. Gen. Arnold Shows His Hand</h4>

<p class="fst">Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold, who has been prosecuting the so-called &ldquo;anti-trust&rdquo; cases against the trade unions, arguing before the United States Supreme Court, stated that, &ldquo;labor ... should not be permitted to destroy itself by factional war.&rdquo; This statement was made in connection with Arnold&rsquo;s attempt to prosecute the officials of the AFL-Carpenters Union as the result of a jurisdictional strike against the AFL-Machinists in the Anheuser-Busch brewery at St. Louis.</p>

<p>When asked by Justice Frankfurter whether his argument would apply to a similar dispute between the AFL and the CIO. <I>Arnold replied that it would.</I> If the UAW-CIO were to strike Ford and the Ford company-union claimed that the CIO was striking against its &ldquo;jurisdiction,&rdquo; which it probably would, then, according to Arnold&rsquo;s &ldquo;logic,&rdquo; this too would be a jurisdictional strike in which he, the great crusader, would step in to save labor from &ldquo;destroying itself by factional war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The power to suppress competition,&rdquo; says Arnold, &ldquo;is far more dangerous than the power to fix prices.&rdquo; Arnold refers here not to the competition between business establishments, but to the competition among the workers for jobs. When he attacks the &ldquo;power to suppress competition&rdquo; in this case, what lie is referring to is the right of the legitimate trade unions to act as the exclusive bargaining agency for the workers.</p>

<p>Having camouflaged his real aim during the early stages of his anti-labor campaign by confining himself mainly to the jurisdictional disputes in the AFL, Arnold is now preparing his second and more brazen line of attack &ndash; &ldquo;anti-trust&rdquo; prosecution in disputes between the AFL and CIO. The final stage will be a direct assault upon the established principles of union recognition.</p>

<p>Arnold is fighting to maintain the anti-union &ldquo;open shop&rdquo; in industry. It is well to remind the workers and the &ldquo;labor statesmen&rdquo; that he is a subordinate of a member of Roosevelt&rsquo;s cabinet.<br />

<h4>Anti-Labor Bills Secretly Prepared</h4>

<p class="fst">A Washington correspondent of the <B>New York Post</B> reports that bills giving state and local authorities unprecedented powers in anti-labor activity have been secretly prepared in Washington. They are designed for submission next month to nearly all state legislatures.</p>

<p>One bill provides a ten-year jail sentence and $10,000 fine for anyone who &ldquo;intentionally ... interferes&rdquo; with property to &ldquo;hinder, delay or interfere with national defense.&rdquo; Another section provides a similar punishment for anyone who &ldquo;intentionally&rsquo;&rsquo; is responsible for any defect in an article which is &ldquo;intended to be used in connection with national defense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Virtually everything from common pins to cannon can be construed as &ldquo;used in national defense.&rdquo; Therefore, this bill could and would in almost every instance be applied against the trade Unions. The word &ldquo;intentionally&rdquo; would be used as a convenient pretext in preparing frame-ups against the workers.</p>

<p>A second bill would provide each state with what amounts to an official vigilante organization, the members of which would be free from arrest for almost anything except &ldquo;treason or felony.&rdquo; In the business of strike-breaking it is considered neither treason nor a felony to club down the striking workers on a picket line. This becomes a matter of &ldquo;civic duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These bills will be introduced in the state legislatures behind a smoke-screen of hysterical agitation against &ldquo;subversive activities,&rdquo; &ldquo;sabotage,&rdquo; and &ldquo;espionage.&rdquo;</p>
