<hr>
<p class="fst"><span class="cap">D</span>ear Comrade,</p>


<p class="fst">Sorry we failed to acknowledge receipt of your letters
of December 23 and 28, 1954, and the enclosed documents. We did,
however, promptly comply with all your requests contained in the
letters.</p>



<p>There has never been any doubt in our minds that Pablo was involved
in one way or another in the emergence of a pro Stalinist faction in
the LSSP, even though this faction was later repudiated by Pablo. He
was compelled to repudiate also Clarke, Lawrence, and Mestre, after he
first directed them onto the liquidationist road. William Silva&#8217;s
remarks only corroborate what we had suspected for some time.<br>
</p>


<p>Your letter to the IC dealing with the question of unity is a well
reasoned document representing undoubtedly the views of all the
organizations adhering to the IC, at least in its fundamental
assessment of the problem. To our knowledge, no one of the adherents of
the IC has any illusions about the possibility of establishing unity
with the Pabloites. No one has any sympathy for the conciliationist
position of the LSSP.</p>


<p>Some tactical differences have manifested themselves on the best way
to deal with the Ceylonese and other conciliators. We believe, however,
that those differences are largely episodic and are mostly due to
misunderstanding.</p>


<p>How shall we treat this problem of the conciliators? Their only
concern is to avoid taking a clear stand and they think they can do it
by working out a formula for a <em>modus vivendi</em> between the
Trotskyists and the Pabloites. But there is no such <em>modus vivendi</em>
possible. The organizations affiliated with the IC have categorically
rejected Pabloite political and organization methods. They had first
hand experience in bitter, irreconcilable struggle and splits with
Pablo&#8217;s agents in their own ranks.</p>


<p>They are fully aware of the great harm Pabloism has done to the
world movement and are in no mood to soften up on this question.</p>



<p>The truth is that if we had thought out the parity committee
question to the end when the proposal was first made, it would have
been rejected at that time. There are many reasons for rejecting this
proposal, but not the least of them is that it should have been
rejected for the good of the Ceylonese. The best way to deal with the
Ceylonese is to make them realize beyond a doubt that there is no room
for maneuvers between the Trotskyists and the Pabloites. From this
point of view, the parity committee is not an aid but a hindrance in
winning the Ceylonese to unqualified support of the IC.</p>


<p>The misunderstanding within the IC grew out of the acceptance of the
parity committee proposal, while no one really wanted it or expected to
accomplish anything through it. It was accepted under the false concept
which you even repeat in your last letter, that to reject the proposal
would place on the IC the onus of responsibility for the split.</p>


<p>However the question of the onus of responsibility for split is not
at all so simple. In the first place, we are not dealing here with a
mass movement in which one must be concerned that the masses who are
generally yearning for unity do not consider us an anti unity force. We
are dealing with comparatively small vanguard groups of more or less
politically alert people. They know who was responsible for the split
in France, England, and elsewhere. If they don&#8217;t know it, then we had
better get busy explaining it. The split was due to the attempt to
impose an alien line and alien organizational methods on the Trotskyist
world movement. If this is not known the task then is to continue to
explain this.</p>


<p>The split was brought about by Pablo. It was brought about by
underhanded methods of deceit and subterfuge or outright brutality, as
in France. It makes no sense to talk at this stage of the onus of
responsibility for the split. We must work instead to complete the task
of ridding the movement of Pabloism and to unite the Trotskyist forces
within the framework of the IC. We should demand of the Ceylonese to
join us in this task.</p>


<p>The IC however has been caught on the hook of a maneuver to
establish &#8220;responsibility for the split.&#8221; You proposed to get off the
hook by combining the acceptance of the parity committee proposal with
a number of political demands which would be unacceptable to the
Pabloites and would in turn hook the Ceylonese. This proposal was too
obvious a maneuver. To accept the parity committee proposal for a
discussion leading to unity, and at the same time pose a series of
demands which add up to a rejection of Pabloism and agreement in
advance with the IC position, would be interpreted by everyone and
especially the Ceylonese as a maneuver which smacks of ultimatism.</p>


<p>We are convinced that the majority of the IC rejected this proposal
not out of conciliationist considerations but because the proposal
offered a poor solution. However, by accepting without qualifications
the parity committee proposal the IC gave the impression it believes
reunification is on the order of the day.</p>


<p>The correct course as we see it now would have been to reject
outright the parity committee proposal as a cheap maneuver by Pablo to
gain new advantage for his assault on Trotskyism and prevent his being
thrust into oblivion. If Pablo seriously entertained the idea of unity,
he would never have gone through with the rump 4th congress. That act
itself represented a consummation of the world split. The struggle to
reconstitute a Trotskyist world movement requires at this stage a blunt
political and organizational confrontation, not maneuvers. This would
be a line that would express our convictions. It would be simple to
explain and would confront vacillators with an unmistakable choice
between Pablo and the IC.</p>


<p>But this line was not the one that was taken. We were as much in
error on this as anybody. We propose now that this become the line at
the next meeting of the IC. We believe you should adopt a resolution
along these lines for the benefit of the Trotskyists in the first
instance.</p>


<p>What we do then with the parity committee proposal after that
becomes secondary. There are two possible courses open.</p>



<p>One is to declare openly that upon further consideration of the
parity committee proposal we have decided to reject it because the
world movement would gain nothing from such maneuvers, and explain why
this is so.</p>


<p>The second course is to leave the parity committee on ice and
proceed with our own course. We would continue with the struggle of
winning people away from Pabloism, prepare our own documents, carry
through our own discussion, and prepare a congress.</p>


<p>If the Pabloites wish to summon a meeting of the parity committee,
we can tell them we have nothing to take up we are not ready, we are
busy with our own discussion.</p>


<p>These, in brief, are our views on this question. We will appreciate
your comments on the general line of this letter and, if you agree with
that line, we would like your thoughts on the alternate tactical
courses outlined with regard to terminating the parity committee.</p>

<p>
P.S.: The Latin American comrades complain that their correspondence
remains unanswered by the IC. Can you clarify this?</p>
