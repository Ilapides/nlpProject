<p class="fst"><strong>Tell the West</strong><br/>
by Jerzy Gliksman<br/>
<em>New York, Gresham Prell 1948, $3.00</em></p>

<p class="fst">Jerzy Gliksman was, until 1939, a leading member of the Jewish
Socialist Bund of Poland. He was a brother of Viktor Alter, the
famous Polish socialist who was subsequently to be murdered together
with Heinrich Ehrlich, another leading Polish socialist, by the
Stalinist regime.</p>

<p>When the war broke out in 1939, Gliksman remained in Warsaw until
the Nazi armies were virtually at its gates, participating in the
attempt to organize labor resistance to the Nazis after the Polish
government had collapsed. He fled eastward when resistance seemed
quite hopeless. Like many other socialists, he rather naively
expected to receive, if not an enthusiastic, then at least a decent
welcome from the Russians.</p>

<p>The welcome he did receive was arrest by the Stalinist secret
police, incarceration for months without charges presented against
him, and finally a five-year sentence to a Siberian labor camp as a
socially suspect individual. The warden of the prison in which he was
held slapped Gliksman on the back and told him he&#8217;d be reconstructed
into a good Soviet citizen in Siberia.</p>

<p>Gliksman&#8217;s book (a strangely impassive and therefore in some ways
particularly impressive work) records his experiences in jail, on a
cattle car riding across Russia to Siberia, and during a year in a
Siberian lager. It would be useless here to repeat the incredibly
bestial details of the suffering he underwent and of the life of
slave laborers in Siberia. Suffice it to say that anyone interested
in this question will wish to read the book: it is an absolutely
honest, painfully restrained, completely apolitical record of human
suffering, distorted neither by passion nor bias. Gliksman is not a
skillful writer, but under the circumstances his very lack of skill
is something of an advantage. For the mere dreary recital of the
facts &#8211;  of the inhuman labor conditions, the constant hunger, the
degradation of prisoners in the camps &#8211; is eloquent enough.</p>

<p>By and large Gliksman&#8217;s book supports the theoretical conclusions
about forced labor in Russia that were discussed in this magazine
several months back in connection with David Dallin&#8217;s study of that
subject. The object of Stalinism was, unlike Hitler&#8217;s, not primarily
to terrorize oppositionists, its object was primarily to find large
supplies of cheap and expendable labor. In practice, the horror of
one was duplicated by the other.</p>

<p>Add Gliksman&#8217;s book to the gruesome list of books that describe
the life of men under modern totalitarianism.</p>
