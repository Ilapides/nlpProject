<p class="fst"><strong>Literature and Art</strong><br/>
Selections from the Writings of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels<br/>
<em>International Publishers. $2.25. 154 pp.</em></p>

<p class="fst">This book should be read by three groups of readers: those
interested in Marxism; those interested in literature and art; and
finally those interested in Marxism and literature and art.</p>

<p>Most of the selections are available elsewhere in English
translation, but it is very useful to have this compilation,
especially since there is no Stalinist introduction to besmirch it.
It contains selected passages from books, unpublished fragments and
letters which reflect the cultural attitudes of Marx and Engels. It
is divided into four sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The Origin and Development of Art</em>, which contains
the most familiar material: the famous discussions of the
relationship of art to society, the &#8220;superstructure&#8221; of ideology
to the social &#8220;base.&#8221; There are selections from The German
Ideology, a few fragments and the famous letters of Engels to
Schmidt and Starkenberg in which he repudiates mechanistic
interpretations of historical materialism.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>Art in Capitalist Society</em>, which contains selections
on the specific effects of capitalist society on the practice of
art. There is an obscure polemical section from Marx&#8217;s <strong>Theorien
&#252;ber den Mehrwert</strong> and an extraordinarily brilliant fragment by
Marx on the dehumanizing effects of money.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>Realism in Art</em>, mostly drawn from letters by Engels
discussing his conceptions of realism in art. To this reviewer, this
section is the shakiest in the book; many of Engels&#8217; observations
are very keen but others show a spirit not too sensitive to the
purposes and nature of art (as for instance, his definition of
realism as &#8220;the truthful reproduction of typical characters under
typical circumstances.&#8221;)<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>Literary History</em>, which analyzes cultural periods
and individual writers, among them Goethe, Heine, Shelley and Byron,
Thomas Hood, Carlyle, Chateaubriand and Balzac. This section
contains the most material previously unpublished in English and is
by far the liveliest and most controversial.</li>
</ul>

<p class="fst">I do not wish in this brief notice to start juggling the old
chestnuts about Marxism and art, propaganda and art, etc., which have
contributed so much to the dreariness of recent years. I wish only to
note a few reactions to the book which will, I hope, stimulate others
to read it.</p>

<p>Marx and Engels did not write a comprehensive work of esthetics;
they dealt with the subject only in passing. Marx did have in mind a
book on Balzac, whom he greatly admired for his depiction of 19th
century French social types; but even if that book had been written,
it would probably have been an unpretentious study of certain social
implications of Balzac&#8217;s novel, and not a &#8220;Marxist analysis&#8221; of
Balzac as a writer. Marx and Engels developed a method of historical
analysis, but there is no indication that they considered it also a
method of literary criticism or a substitute for literary criticism.
They were tempted occasionally to apply their method to literary
history, but they nowhere indicate in these writings that they
believed literature to be only an aspect of history.</p>

<p>These selections from Marx and Engels contain statements which if
made by latter-day Marxists would, at least until a few years ago,
have been considered downright heretical, as for instance one by Marx:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is well known that certain periods of highest
development of art stand in no direct connection with the general
development of society, nor with the material basis and skeleton
structure of its organization. Witness the example of the Greeks ...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Now it is true that if anyone so desired he could go through this
volume and find some pretty crude statements in which the authors,
especially Engels, judge literary works by political standards. But
this would be a misleading procedure for at least three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>During the early years of Marx&#8217;s and Engels&#8217;
intellectual development, their historical method was itself often
crude and still fuzzy with Hegelian verbiage; many of the selections
are taken from this period and it is only natural that its crudity
should overflow into literary judgment.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>While in their published writings Marx and Engels confine
themselves usually to discussions of cultural history and origin,
they reserve most of their literary judgments for private letters
and usually hastily written &#8220;off the cuff.&#8221; Thus there are some
harsh statements by Marx in a letter on Heine; yet it is common
knowledge that he considered Heine the greatest German poet of his
time. Marx was able to distinguish between categories of discourse.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Some of the crudities are merely personal lapses of taste,
usually those of Engels. By comparison with Marx, Engels&#8217; literary
writings seem almost pedestrian. (Yet in fairness to Engels it
should be noted that he writes that &#8220;The writer is not obliged to
intrude on the reader the future historical solutions of the social
conflicts pictured.&#8221;) Marx indulges more frequently in strictly
literary judgments; he had a much finer esthetic sensibility than
Engels and his remarks show a strong interest in and love for
literature as sheer literature, that is, what James T. Farrell calls
&#8220;the refreshment value&#8221; of a work of art. (<strong>A Note on Literary
Criticism</strong>)</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">Yet, though there were lapses, one can only marvel that men who
spent their lives in political conflict still had such fine and
certain taste. They did not allow their newly developed and
explosively powerful method of historical analysis to obliterate
their feeling for the cultural tradition of the past. In Aeschylus,
Shakespeare and Goethe, his favorite authors, Marx did not seek
&#8220;solutions&#8221;; nor did he analyze them in terms of their &#8220;social
context.&#8221; That was left for others.</p>

<p>It is clear from these writings that the Marxist historical method
contributes a great deal to an understanding of the origins and
development of a cultural tradition or a work of art &#8211; the more so,
Engels tells us, &#8220;the longer the period considered and the wider
the field dealt with.&#8221; That is, it helps in the intellectual
placement of literary material antecedent to its literary judgment in
somewhat the same way that Freudianism does. But I think all the
internal evidence of this book substantiates Edmund Wilson when he
writes in his essay, Marxism and Literature, that &#8220;Marxism by
itself can tell us nothing whatever about the goodness or badness of
a work of art ... A man may be an excellent Marxist but if he lacks
imagination and taste he will be unable to make the choice between a
good and an inferior book ...&#8221;</p>

<p>But to return to the book. There are some things in it that are
quite extraordinary. I have mentioned already the selection called by
the editor <em>The All-Revolutionizing Power of Money</em>. Though
draped in Hegelian linguistic paradoxes, this fragment, based on
selections from Goethe and Shakespeare, is a remarkable <em>tour de
force</em> on the dehumanizing role of money in modern life.</p>

<p>There are some things with which the modern reader is bound to
disagree &#8211; as for instance, I think, Marx&#8217;s judgment that the
reason we are attracted to Greek culture is that Greece represents
the childhood of humanity and the &#8220;Greeks were normal children.&#8221;
That seems to this reviewer a gross over-simplification.</p>

<p>But the essential virtue of Marx&#8217;s and almost always Engels&#8217;
writings on literature is that they are aware of the existence of
culture as an activity of human beings which is its own sanction &#8211;
and which, though subject to and part of historical development,
still possesses value not reducible to that relationship. For though
their historical method necessarily involves reduction of complex
phenomena of conceptually ordered sequences &#8211; as must any
historical method &#8211; they are equally aware that this very same
method may be fatal for an analysis of art. They did not establish an
esthetics, they didn&#8217;t claim to, and they didn&#8217;t relieve their
followers of the obligation of knowledge and taste. They did,
however, change man&#8217;s vision of this world &#8211; which was enough.</p>
