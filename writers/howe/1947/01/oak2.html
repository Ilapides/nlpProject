<p class="fst">Mr. Liston Oak<br />
Managing Editor, <B>New Leader</B><br />
7 East
15th Street<br />
New York City</p>

<p class="fst">Dear Mr. Oak:</p>

<p class="fst">You have by now received, I am sure, a copy of the January 13
issue of <B>Labor Action</B> in which I commented on your use of a
picture of your comrade, Leon Blum, leader of the French Social
Democracy, under which there was printed, in your column <I>Trends, </I>a
caption stating that Blum &ldquo;reaffirms Indo-Chinese
independence.&rdquo; You will recall, too, that I suggested that the
use of this caption, in light of the recent behavior of the Blum
cabinet, was to commit a falsehood. And, further, that the official
silence of the <B>The New Leader</B>, as well as the caption under
Blum&rsquo;s picture in your column and William Henry Chamberlain&rsquo;s
shame-faced defense of French imperialism, cast a certain doubt on
the &ldquo;democratic values&rdquo; on which you pride yourself and
which you so sharply contrasted to &ldquo;Bolshevik amorality&rdquo;
in your debate with Max Shachtman.</p>

<p><I>Perhaps I have been wrong. I therefore want to tell you about a
project which we of the Workers Party and <B>Labor Action</B> are
planning. On Saturday, January 25, between 12 and 1&nbsp;p.m., we are
going to run a picket line around the French consulate protesting
French oppression of the Indo-Chinese national independence movement.
We are going to urge the French to withdraw their troops from
Indo-China and grant that country immediate and unconditional
independence. Surely you, as a defender of democratic values, must
agree with that!</I></p>

<p>I am therefore proposing that you, as a defender of democratic
values, join with us on the picket line protesting the sending of
General LeClerc by the Blum cabinet to Indo-China, as well as the
statements of Minister Moutet in which he insisted on a &ldquo;military
decision&rdquo; as a preliminary to negotiations with Viet Nam.</p>

<p><I>Since you might feel a little uncomfortable marching on a
picket line under the banner of &ldquo;amoral Bolsheviks&rdquo; who
believe that Socialists should not send royalist generals to shoot
colonial peoples, I am prepared to persuade the Workers Party to let
you march in the picket line <B>under your own banner and with your
own slogans</B>. You will not think it impertinent if I suggest a few
slogans for your contingent:</I></p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Dear Comrade Blum: Stop shooting Indo-Chinese
fighters for national independence.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;Dear Comrade Blum: It is unsocialist to send a
known reactionary and imperialist like LeClerc to suppress the
Indo-Chinese.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;Dear Comrade Moutet: As a member of the French
Social-Democracy, you shouldn&rsquo;t talk and act like Winston
Churchill or Charles de Gaulle.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Will we see you around next Saturday?</p>
