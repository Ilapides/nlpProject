<p class="fst">The splendid dispatches which our special overseas correspondent,
A. Rudzienski, has furnished this paper and <B>The New International</B>
on the Polish situation have given an unrivalled picture of one of
the most chaotic and terrible political situations in Europe today.
His article in last week&rsquo;s issue details the manner in which
the Stalinists, an unpopular minority in the nation, have wormed
their way into the apparatus of other parties in order to render
ineffective any opposition to their Moscow-buttressed rule.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the opposition continues, grows, develops. Dispatches
from Warsaw by Sydney Gruson, <B>New York Times</B> correspondent,
pile detail upon detail, unnecessary to repeat here, of how the
elections scheduled for January 19 are being rigged in the most
outrageous fashion. Candidates of the opposition Peasant Party have
been kidnapped, murdered and imprisoned. A dissident Socialist group
which, unlike the official Socialist Party, has refused to accept
Stalinist domination, has been completely barred from the ballot.</p>

<p>And now the Stalinists have worked out a new device: they are
&ldquo;persuading&rdquo; workers to go <I>en masse</I> to the polls
to register an &ldquo;open&rdquo; vote &ndash; why be ashamed of how
you vote, say the totalitarian rascals of Stalinism. Since refusal to
participate in this &ldquo;open&rdquo; casting of votes is tantamount
to a declaration of opposition to Stalinism &ndash; a dangerous step
involving possible loss of work and bread &ndash; this latest
Stalinist trick insures them of an electoral victory. (The hungry and
weary Polish workers remember that the city of Cracow was punished
for its mass opposition to the Stalinist &ldquo;constitution&rdquo;
in the referendum held last fall by having thousands of its citizens
deported from their homes.)</p>

<p>The political situation in Poland is admittedly complex: a
Stalinist government supported by Russian bayonets, without
sufficient mass support to enable it to rule independently; mass
terror as political method; a heterogeneous opposition, both
semi-legal and illegal, whose political composition ranges from
extreme antiStalinist left to the extreme fascistic and anti-Semitic
right.</p>

<p>The outside world is unable to discover the exact internal
political differentiation within this opposition, the strength of the
various tendencies and their relation to each other; though there is
no reason to accept as valid the Stalinist smear of the opposition as
fascist. For we do know that during the Nazi occupation there
appeared in Poland underground newspapers which were both socialist
and anti-Stalinist in character; since the Stalinist state does not
permit their legal existence today, such tendencies must function
underground.</p>

<p><I>The choice for revolutionary socialists seems difficult (with
the result that some people in the socialist movement, secure in the
warm comfort of their <B>Finished Program</B>, keep a
discreet silence on the matter.) Should revolutionary socialists,
both in Poland and elsewhere, take their stand beside the Stalinist
government, which has nationalized much of Poland&rsquo;s industry
and expropriated that remnant of its capitalist class which remained
after the war? But that means to support the Stalinist terror. That
means to support the Stalinist attempt to consolidate their
totalitarian apparatus and destroy the opposition to it. <B>It
means for the revolutionary movement to sign its death warrant.</B></I>
<I>For a Stalinist consolidation in Poland would result in drying up
of the normal channels of political expression, the imposition of the
grey blanket of terror and enforced unanimity. Poland, like Russia,
would become the &ldquo;Land of the Single Opinion.&rdquo;</I></p>

<p>But can revolutionary socialists conceive of working with the
Mickolajczyk-led opposition? Is he not in favor of the restoration of
private property in those industries where it has been abolished? Is
he not an agent of Anglo-American imperialism? Yes, of course he is.
And it is undoubtedly true that there are anti-Semitic and fascistic
groups in the underground which, whether he encourages them or not,
look to him for leadership. But let us admit that this is a <I>new</I>
situation, which cannot be completely viewed in old ways. There is no
doubt that the masses of Poland oppose the government. (Rudzienski&rsquo;s
articles have demonstrated that beyond a doubt; I shall not repeat
his data, but merely refer the skeptical reader to past issues of
<B>Labor Action</B>.) Even if a socialist opposition to the Stalinist
government were to declare itself equally against both the Stalinists
and Mickolajczyk, it would be forced in practice to cooperate with
the opposition in defense against Stalinist terror.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Against the GPU Regime</h4>

<p class="fst">The masses of peasants and most of the workers are sympathetic to
the opposition. To support the Stalinist government against
Mickolajczyk means therefore not merely to aid in the
totalitarianization of Poland; it means to isolate oneself from the
Polish masses and take one&rsquo;s side besides the bureaucratic and
privileged strata bribed into serving as Stalin&rsquo;s Polish
agents. We therefore say that the task of Polish revolutionary
socialists is to give <I>critical</I> support to the opposition camp.</p>

<p><I>By this formula we mean: the revolutionary socialists would do
their best to maintain their organizational independence, and would
not tolerate submergence within the opposition. It would continually
distinguish its revolutionary socialist program from the capitalist
program of Mickolajczyk and would attempt to take over the leadership
of the opposition to ensure a politically fruitful struggle against
Stalinism. But it would work within and cooperate with the opposition
wherever the opposition fought against GPU regime.</I></p>

<p>Those who disagree with this course must answer the question: When
the GPU men come to arrest a Peasant Party leader, do you aid them in
the arrest or try to prevent it?</p>

<p>For one cannot stand aside when an incipient civil war is raging,
nor can one keep silent merely because it is an unprecedented
situation. Those, of course, like the Socialist Workers Party in this
country, who make a mockery of socialist ideas by proclaiming
Stalin&rsquo;s Russian prison camp a &ldquo;workers&rsquo; state,&rdquo;
have no <I>logical</I> alternative but to support the totalitarian
Polish government against the opposition; for according to their
position, is not Poland, with its nationalized industries, a
&ldquo;workers&rsquo; state&rdquo; (since, for them, nationalized
economy equals &ldquo;workers&rsquo; state&rdquo;) and is not
Mickolajczyk the representative of capitalist restoration? But since
this position is more than a little embarrassing, they prefer the
course of silence.</p>

<p>We for our part acknowledge that the position outlined here is
fraught with danger, that it requires a most skillful leadership to
apply it successfully. But it does point a way out of the dilemma.
For the major need in Poland today is to drive out the Russian
oppressors, once again to give the Polish masses a chance to
determine their own destinies. Given such a chance, we are sure they
would choose neither the satraps of Stalinism nor the remnants of the
old anti-Semitic arid fascist &ldquo;colonels&rdquo; clique which
ruled Poland before Hitler&rsquo;s invasion. To open the gates to the
possibility of mass political participation and expression, rather
than to help drive in the GPU clamps on those gates, is the purpose
of our position.</p>
