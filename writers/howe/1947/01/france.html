<p class="fst">A considerable fuss has been raised about the short-lived Blum
cabinet in France. It has been hailed in the American press as a
brilliant administration which has gone far to revive the French
Social Democracy and the position of France as a power. There is no
doubt that, <I>within certain limits</I>, the Blum cabinet has acted
with energy and dispatch. It enforced a reduction of five per cent in
France&rsquo;s price structure and it initiated negotiations with
England for a mutual assistance pact. If an election were held in
France today it is quite likely that the Social Democracy would get a
larger vote than it did in the recent election where it fell to the
position of a second rate party.</p>

<p>At this point we should return to the words <i>&ldquo;within
certain limits&rdquo;</I> which appeared in the sentence above
describing the energy of the Blum cabinet. For the Social Democracy
of France has been neither desirous nor able to lift itself from its
basic historical role as agent of its native capitalism. The
reduction in prices, though of some aid to the French workers, is
conceived of mainly as a device to forestall their persistent wage
demands. And the proposed pact with Britain is merely a maneuver
entirely within the limits of capitalist diplomacy. The Social
Democrats did not try to effect any basic changes in the French
social structure; that is not their role.</p>

<p>But most revealing was their attitude toward the Indo-Chinese
revolt. Blum&rsquo;s behavior was in no essential respect different
from that which would have characterized de Gaulle or Bidault. Blum
sent a top military man and one of its most reactionary politicians,
General Leclerc, to suppress the Indo-Chinese; he reaffirmed the
appointment of Admiral d&rsquo;Argenlieu, Indo-Chinese governor,
whose callous imperialist behavior had so incensed the people of the
colony; and he further supported his Minister, Moutet, who after a
trip to Indo-China issued statements refusing even to negotiate with
the nationalist rebels.</p>

<p>That is the record of Social Democracy. Whatever quirks of energy
or verbal boldness it may indulge in, its historical role remains the
same as before: it is indissolubly wedded to the maintenance of
capitalism.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The French Stalinists And Indo-China</h4>

<p class="fst">The <B>Daily Worker</B> in this country has maintained a strange
silence on the Indo-Chinese events and especially on the statements
of the French Stalinists in support of French imperialism (reported
in <B>Labor Action</B> a few weeks back). It has, however, printed
reports, which appeared simultaneously in the capitalist press, that
the French Stalinists have come out in favor of negotiations with
Viet Nam, the Indo-Chinese nationalist movement.</p>

<p><I>We should clearly understand the significance of this stand by
the French Stalinists. They have not adopted a revolutionary position
on this matter, or anything even resembling a revolutionary position.
As a party of &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; (that is, of complicity In
the French parliamentary swindles) the French CP has NOT raised the
slogan of independence for Indo-China. It has merely urged that
negotiations be resumed with Viet Nam, a demand which the more
intelligent variety of imperialists can and do support.</I></p>

<p>The sharpest contrast can be made between the Stalinists in France
and the Parti Communiste Internationaliste, French section of the
Fourth International. The PCI has a very simple position on
Indo-China. It demands that French imperialism get out, lock, stock
and barrel; it demands that every French soldier be withdrawn. It
does not, as does the French CP, offer advice to French imperialism
on how to resume relations with and therefore domination of
Indo-China. It says: Get out, get out; let the Indo-Chinese people
determine their own faith. That is a revolutionary socialist
position; it is the ONLY democratic position on this matter.
Everything else, anything else, the slightest equivocation, the
slightest hesitation &ndash; means support of imperialism. And here
too is a testing ground for political positions.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The American Liberals and Indo-China</h4>

<p class="fst">One cannot read the so-called liberal and even radical press on
the events in Indo-China without feeling a strong sense of nausea.
Look through the <B>New Republic</B>, <B>The Nation</B>, <B>PM</B>,
the <B>New York Post</B>, the <B>Wisconsin Progressive</B>, and that
most wretched of sheets, <B>The New Leader</B> &ndash; and you will
not find a word in behalf of Indo-Chinese independence. There were
times when the American liberals, whatever their ultimate
shortcomings, were at least able to rally behind comparatively simple
issues like colonial independence where the democratic (if not
Marxist) position is so indicated as to make impossible any
double-talk. But even that day is past.</p>

<p><B>The Nation</B> and <B>The New Republic</B> (Henry Wallace,
Editor) hem and haw, and question if the French are conducting
themselves quite properly. <B>The New Leader</B>, a sheet for the
decayed minds of ex-radicals, prints tripe by Henry William
Chamberlain, as witness:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;If Moutet is now convinced, as is reported in
dispatches from Indo-China, that a military decision must be sought,
I am inclined to believe that the responsibility for the recent
flare-up of fighting is on the Viet Nam side. The Overseas Minister
is not the kind of man who would lend himself to any act of
imperialist aggression.&rdquo;</I></p>

<p class="fst"><I>This is tripe; this is a lie; this is support of French
imperialism; this is writing as an enemy of simple democracy, which
demands that the Indo-Chinese be allowed national independence.
Strong words? Yes, they are; perhaps not the nicest language or most
diplomatic characterizations. But there is a limit to everything. And
the sight of these pious liberals, these democratic worthies who are
so ready to read us lectures about &ldquo;Bolshevik amorality&rdquo;
&ndash; the sight, I say, of these liberals twisting themselves all
over creation in the attempt to condone the French suppressions, is
more than any socialist should be able to bear without anger.</I></p>
