About Blum

<p class="info">From <strong>Labor Action</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/laboraction-ny/1947/index.htm#la11_02" target="new">Vol. 11 No. 2</a>, 13 January 1947, p.&nbsp;3.<br />

<p class="fst">In the December 28, 1946, issue of <B>The New Leader</B>, there
appears in the regular column which Liston Oak writes, <I>Trends</I>,
a picture of Leon Blum, leader of the French Social Democracy with an
accompanying caption: <i>&ldquo;LEON BLUM &ndash; Reaffirmed
Independence for Viet Nam</I>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><B>The New Leader</B> is a Social Democratic paper and Liston Oak
is its managing editor, though he professes a certain organizational
independence from the Social Democrats. Oak has made a specialty of
writing preachments about &ldquo;democratic values&rdquo; and in a
recent debate with Max Shachtman, chairman of the Workers Party,
attacked Bolshevism for what he called its &ldquo;undemocratic&rdquo;
practices.</p>

<p><I>Now there appears in his column this really remarkable caption
under Leon Blum&rsquo;s picture. At a time when Blum&rsquo;s
government is sending General Jacques Leclerc and several thousand
troops from North Africa to aid in the suppression of the
Indo-Chinese independence movement: at a time when the party of Leon
Blum in conjunctlon with the MRP and the Stalinists has voted in the
Chamber of Deputies for motions of support for the troops attempting
to re-establish the control of French imperialism in Indo-China (see
last week&rsquo;s <B>Labor Action</B> for exact reports of this); at
this time Liston Oak, the defender of &ldquo;democratic values&rdquo;
carries in his column the outright falsehood that Blum reaffirms
independence for Viet Nam.</I></p>

<p>We wish to ask Oak, and we are certain the entire radical public
would be greatly interested in his reply:</p>

<p>Is not your &ldquo;comrade&rdquo; Leon Blum the Premier of the
Government which has sent Leclerc, notorious for his previous record
of antidemocratic suppression, to Indo-China to help smash the Viet
Nam?</p>

<p><I>Did not your &ldquo;comrade&rdquo; Blum retract his
pusillanimous statement in <B>Le Populaire</B> about freedom for
Indo-China in favor of a statement urging its &ldquo;freedom within
the framework of the French union&rdquo; &ndash; the favorite dodge
of all supporters of imperialism?</I></p>

<p>And what will you, Liston Oak, and your <B>New Leader</B> with all
its democratic pretentions now say about the imperialist record of
the French Social Democrats who are going their (and your) comrades
of the British Labor Party one better &ndash; though there have not
yet been reports of your &ldquo;comrade&rdquo; Blum&rsquo;s troops
legally whipping Indo-Chinese the way your &ldquo;comrade&rdquo;
Bevin&rsquo;s troops legally whip Palestinian Jews?</p>

<p>For the question is, Liston Oak, what price &ldquo;democratic
values?&rdquo;</p>
