<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%">
<p class="fst">In its summer 1946 issue, <strong>Partisan Review</strong> printed an
editorial attacking the Stalinist &#8220;Fifth Column&#8221; in American
intellectual life: the <strong>New Republic</strong>, <strong>The Nation</strong> and <strong>PM</strong>.
Marking a demonstrative return to contemporary political concerns by
a magazine which in recent years showed slight visible interest in
them, this editorial serves as a central point from which to discuss
the attitude of radical intellectuals to political problems.</p>

<p>Though intended primarily as an expos&#233; of the corrosion of the
liberal press by Stalinism, the editorial casually and by the
blandest references adopts a position toward the current political
scene which can only render impossible an effective struggle against
Stalinism &#8211; not to mention making hopeless any sort of positive
socialist aim. <strong>Partisan Review</strong> has succumbed to <em>Stalinophobia</em>,
a disease common among intellectuals who were once radicals; its
major symptom is that regular tired feeling. <em>Stalinophobia</em>
takes the form of bitter and quite justified denunciations of
Stalinism, without any corresponding effort to develop a sociological
understanding of it. Hatred for Stalinism becomes an emotional bloc
to its political analysis. (The pages of <strong>The New Leader</strong> &#8211;
from whose basic position the editors of <strong>PR</strong> cannot distinguish
themselves) even if they would wish to &#8211; are cluttered with such
vulgar articles which do not even attempt to understand Stalinism and
which always lead to support of one or another reactionary
imperialism solely because of its conjunctural opposition to Russia.)
The victims of <em>Stalinophobia</em> &#8211; which disease the editors of
<strong>PR</strong>, in their November&#8211;December 1946 issue, coyly try to
equate with mere concern at the expanded power of Stalinism &#8211;
succumb to the same inadequate and often hysterical method of
thinking which characterized most American liberals at the time of
Hitler&#8217;s power. As witness:</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>PR</strong> declares that &#8220;<em>as long as American policy is weak
and halting</em>, the peoples of Europe ... will gravitate helplessly
... into the Russian orbit.&#8221; (My emphasis &#8211; <em>I.H.</em>) The
italicized phrase is central. By its use, <strong>PR</strong> rejects the
method of analysis which characterizes the basic aspects of American
foreign policy in class terms and substitutes instead the typical
liberal (as opposed to socialist) approach of &#8220;test your strength.&#8221;
<strong>PR</strong> wants a strong foreign policy in relation to Russia and
objects to the present (&#8220;<em>weak</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>Caspar
Milquetoast</em>&#8221; policy of the State Department. It accepts the
State Department&#8217;s own declarations at face value without
understanding that the &#8220;soft&#8221; policy is a necessary stage in
consolidating public support at home and abroad as a prelude to a
&#8220;get tough&#8221; policy at the proper time. These complaints of <strong>PR</strong>
about U.S. foreign policy <em>vis-&#224;-vis</em> Stalin are in no
essential way different from the complaints which filled the pages of
<strong>The Nation</strong>, <strong>The New Republic</strong> and <strong>PM</strong> (the &#8220;fifth
column&#8221; press ...) about U.S. foreign policy <em>vis-&#224;-vis</em> Hitler.</p>

<p>The phrase quoted is not an isolated expression but typical of a
political approach. <strong>PR</strong> urges, similarly, a policy of &#8220;<em>trying
to needle this timidly conservative (State) Department into a more
aggressive (foreign) policy</em> ...&#8221; Here again the same idea &#8211;
even the same stale clich&#233; &#8211; of <strong>PM</strong>, <strong>The New Republic</strong>
and <strong>The Nation</strong> during the period when they supported the
Stalinist collective security policy as a means of defeating
Hitlerism ... or, to be more accurate, of hastening the already
inevitable imperialist war between the Allied bloc and Germany. That
the editorial writer of <strong>PR</strong> recognizes, if only in some
uncharted area of his subconscious, this identity of spirit and
approach with the very Stalinoid magazines he is now castigating, is
evident from his statement that &#8220;<em>Hitler might have been
permanently checked had he been firmly opposed at his very first
steps toward aggression.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>The logic of this position, incidentally. has always been rather
difficult to follow. It asserts that if the Anglo-American bloc had
been &#8220;needled&#8221; into threatening war with Hitler, war would have
been avoided. Unless its proponents wish to suggest the preposterous
idea that Hitler could have been &#8220;peaceably contained,&#8221; their
proposal merely meant a war ... to prevent war; from which conclusion
the Stalinists did not shy away.</p>

<p>One word of commendation, however, is due the editors of <strong>PR</strong>:
though only in a passing phrase, they did not hesitate to face the
consequences of their position &#8211; <em>at least in the Summer &#8217;46 editorial.</em></p>

<p>They write: &#8220;<em>But granted (which we do not believe) that ...
any consistent criticism of Russia will necessarily lead to war; will
appeasement, then, do any better? If war is inevitable, does it not
become a man&#8217;s duty to cry stinking fish and face up to the
inevitable?&#8221;</em> Of course, of course. And by &#8220;stinking fish&#8221;
it is clear that support of U.S. imperialism is meant. An apt image.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4><em>PR</em>&#8217;s Critics</h4>

<p class="fst">Apparently stung by the numerous criticisms which their editorial
evoked, the editors of <strong>PR</strong> return to the same subject in their
November&#8211;December 1946 issue. They print several letters, the main
one by Heinz Eulau of <strong>The New Republic</strong>, and then launch sharp
polemical arrows against 1) the Trotskyists; 2) Dwight Macdonald, and
3) the liberals. <strong>PR</strong>&#8217;s sole, though considerable, advantage
over the <strong>Nation</strong>-<strong>New Republic</strong> liberals is its
anti-Stalinism; though, as we have tried to point out in this
article, its present political methodology is in no essential respect
different from that of the liberals. Macdonald <a href="#na" name="fa">[1]</a>
defends himself in the November 1946 issue of his <strong>Politics</strong>. So
we shall content ourselves with a few words here on the attack on
Trotskyism, as well as the further elaboration of its own position,
contained in the <strong>PR</strong> editorial. The attack on the Trotskyist
position on war is made in three major points:</p>

<p class="fst">1) By a &#8220;<em>verbal sleight of hand&#8221;</em> the Trotskyists
&#8220;<em>surreptitiously place democratic capitalism and Stalinist
totalitarianism on the same plane, as if the evils of the two systems
were really comparable</em> ...&#8221; and then they denounce those who
support U.S. imperialism in the Second or Third World Wars as
adherents to the theory of &#8220;<em>the lesser evil.</em>&#8221; Now there is
here a bit of &#8220;verbal sleight of hand&#8221; but not by the
Trotskyists. Just what does <strong>PR</strong> mean by its accusation that we
place democratic capitalism and Stalinism &#8220;<em>on the same plane</em>&#8221;!
One is surprised to find such a vague spatial image in a magazine
which, in non-political matters, is so concerned with verbal
precision. For several meanings are possible: a) democratic
capitalism and Stalinism are the same kind of social system, which we
of the Workers Party deny; b) democratic capitalism and Stalinism are
both manifestations of an international social disintegration which
if continued will lead humanity to barbarism of one kind or another,
which we affirm; and c) there is no difference between the kind of
<em>political</em> rule (civil liberties, etc.) existing in the U.S.
and Russia, which neither we nor anyone else with faintly perceptive
eyes affirms.</p>

<p>If is c) which <strong>PR</strong> means, as seems it likely, then its point
is a total and obvious <em>non sequitur</em>. For one can clearly admit
the differences in political rule between the U. S. and Russia,
without necessarily supporting the former in a war against the
latter. The mere fact that one country is a capitalist democracy and
the other a bureaucratic dictatorship is no necessary reason in and
of itself, as <strong>PR</strong> assumes, to support the former in a war; for
there may be, and in fact are, other and more fundamental
considerations, and the differences in political superstructures may
not be, and in fact are not, the issues at stake in such a war.</p>

<p>We reject, however, <strong>PR</strong>&#8217;s contention that no comparison is
possible between democratic capitalism and Stalinism and that there
is between them &#8220;<em>the incommensurability of life and death</em>&#8221;
(demonstrated perhaps during the recent war?). Though they are
different social systems, they are both <em>reactionary</em> social
systems and a choice between reactionary systems would be necessary
<em>only if one abandoned the socialist perspective</em>.</p>

<p>We affirm rather that support of either democratic capitalism or
Stalinism in a war means support to the social forces leading
humanity to the abyss of barbarism. Or does <strong>PR</strong> wish to contend
that only Stalinism, and no longer capitalism, is the vehicle of
international social decay?</p>

<p class="fst">2) <strong>PR</strong> no longer believes that &#8220;<em>the masses are at
present capable of overthrowing both capitalism and Stalinism</em>,&#8221;
which leads it therefore, logically enough, to support U.S.
imperialism in its &#8220;<em>resistance to Stalinism</em>.&#8221; (You must
admit that &#8220;resistance to Stalinism&#8221; is a delicate way of putting
it.) Here again we discover lamentable verbal imprecision on the part
of <strong>PR</strong>. If by the above-quoted statement, it merely means that
the masses have not yet overthrown democratic capitalism and
Stalinism or are not doing so at this moment, they have scored an
irrefutable but not very useful point. For what is at stake is this
question: is there a possibility, sufficiently reasonable to warrant
socialists acting on it, of stimulating the masses to such
revolutions? The reasons which lead us to answer this question
affirmatively we shall not detail here; they have been discussed in
this magazine many times, as well as in my article against Dwight
Macdonald in the October issue of <strong>Politics</strong>, who also no longer
believes in the possibility of proletarian socialist revolution. But
we have come a long way from the question of attitude to war; we have
come to the central question of socialism itself. That this statement
is no exaggeration can be seen when considering the next point.</p>

<p class="fst">3) <strong>PR</strong> writes: &#8220;<em>And even if ... the old order could not
be completely destroyed, there still remains one of the basic
questions of our period: what reason is there to believe that the new
society will not repeat the pattern of Stalinism by creating a new
ruling elite and a new form of oppression? Not only have the
Trotskyists failed to present a single scrap of evidence &#8211; or
theory &#8211; to show that the masses are able to accomplish their own
revolution and retain control of it, but they do not seem to be
interested in the question.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>The last clause quoted is simply incredible: the pages of this
magazine have contained dozens of articles which in one way or
another, ably or poorly have discussed this question. <strong>PR</strong> may
not find our answers satisfactory, but to suggest that we are not
interested in the matter is to show very bad taste in conducting a polemic.</p>

<p>However, a much more fundamental question is here raised: what
does <strong>PR</strong> itself believe? For our part, we continue to maintain
&#8220;that the masses are able to accomplish their own revolution and
retain control of it&#8221; &#8211; but perhaps that is merely Marxist
obtuseness? Very well then. If <strong>PR</strong> believes that such a
possibility does not exist, then it has the responsibility to
demonstrate that contention to the socialist movement in general,
which has labored along now under that belief for a good many years.
And what then happens to <strong>PR</strong>&#8217;s socialist protestations? For
if the masses cannot make &#8220;their own revolution and retain control
of it&#8221; then socialism is <em>prima facie</em> impossible.</p>

<p><strong>PR</strong> owes its readers a blunt statement on this matter.
Either it believes that &#8220;the masses are able to accomplish their
own revolution and retain control of it&#8221; &#8211; in which case their
polemic against the Trotskyists is, to be charitable, irrelevant; or
it does not so believe &#8211; in which case it must cease to speak, as
it attempts to do in its editorials, as part of the socialist
tradition. Anything less is intellectual irresponsibility.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">I wish to conclude this discussion with a few notes on <strong>PR</strong>&#8217;s
November&#8211;December 1946 statement, where it attempts to wriggle out
of some of the more embarrassing formulations of its first statement.</p>

<p>In response to the question &#8220;<em>whether we will support America
in a war with Russia</em>,&#8221; <strong>PR</strong> writes, &#8220;<em>we can only say
now that will depend on the existing situation when and if war
comes</em>.&#8221; Such squeamishness seems strange in people who only two
months before were ready to &#8220;<em>cry stinking fish and face up to
the inevitable</em>.&#8221; That this half-hearted attempt to squirm out
of open commitment to U.S. imperialism comes from embarrassment
rather than conviction is shown in the very next sentence where <strong>PR</strong>
urges &#8220;<em>that we propose to support the American policy of
resistance to Stalinism so long as this policy meets the test of
genuinely liberal and democratic standards</em> ...&#8221;</p>

<p>Though we <em>know</em> that Philip Rahv and William Phillips edit
<strong>PR</strong>, we solicit letters from readers explaining how Freda
Kirchway, Max Lerner and Bruce Bliven &#8211; 1938 versions, to the very
phrase &#8211; happen to write their editorials.</p>

<p>Everyone has the right to maintain whatever political position he
wishes, provided he thinks through to the end its logical
consequences. We suspect <strong>PR</strong> on this score because we fail to
note one little phrase in its editorials &#8211; <em>atom bomb</em>. But
since <strong>PR</strong> is preparing to support the U.S. in a war with
Russia, it must also be aware that that would be an atomic war. What
then are the possibilities of the retention after such a war of the
democratic human and cultural values in the name of which <strong>PR</strong>
prepares to &#8220;<em>cry stinking fish and face up to the inevitable?&#8221;</em></p>

<p><strong>PR</strong> must consider the consequences of its course. What
attitude does it have toward current American military preparations?
Are they not essential if &#8220;we&#8221; are to have a firm foreign policy
toward Russia? For whatever Stalin&#8217;s attitude toward editorials, it
is known that he respects armored divisions.</p>

<p>What is <strong>PR</strong>&#8217;s attitude, again, toward the proposals for
conscription? And toward proposals to cease manufacture of the atom
bomb? And what about strikes which weaken U.S. imperialism <em>vis-&#224;-vis</em>
Russia? If <strong>PR</strong> comes to the conclusion that Stalin, like
Hitler, will not be impressed by powerful editorials and ferocious
speeches, is it prepared to urge American imperialism to drop a few
atom bombs on Russia, before Stalin gets the bomb too?</p>
<p>These questions are neither wiseacreish nor tricky. They point to
the inescapable consequences of <strong>PR</strong>&#8217;s political position and
it is incumbent upon its editors, who are so insistent upon
intellectual responsibility in other fields, to speak frankly and
openly on this, a central question of our times.</p>

<h3>Footnote</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#fa" name="na">1.</a> The exchange between <strong>PR</strong> and
Macdonald, though incidental to our purpose, has a few precious
aspects. Relations are bad between these political <em>Heldenk&#228;mpfer</em>
but they do have a few good words to say for each other. <strong>PR</strong>
finds that Macdonald &#8220;as against the Trotskyists, has at least two
points of contact with reality in holding: 1) that the masses are not
revolutionary in the sense that they can be counted upon at present
to rise up of themselves (<em>sic!</em>) and overthrow both capitalist
and totalitarian oppressors; and 2) that Stalinist Russia is a new
class society with a peculiar dynamism of its own which makes it an
expanding threat to the whole world.&#8221; As for the first of these
&#8220;points of contact with reality&#8221; we cheerfully grant <strong>PR</strong>
and Macdonald their common position and readily acknowledge our faith
in the possibility of proletarian socialist revolution, though not of
course by a rising &#8220;of themselves,&#8221; whatever that may mean. On
the second point. the editors of <strong>PR</strong> are either ignorant or
most forgetful, for they must know that at least one section of the
Trotskyist movement &#8211; that associated with this magazine &#8211; not
only believes but was instrumental in expounding in this country the
idea that &#8220;Stalinist Russia is a new class society with a peculiar
dynamism of its own.&#8221;</p>

<p class="note">Macdonald, for his part, finds <strong>PR</strong>&#8217;s polemic against the
Trotskyists &#8220;<em>masterly, as far as it went, since it repeated what
I myself have said often</em> ...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">To this mutual accolade comment would be supererogatory.</p>
