<h1>Intellectuals&#8217; Flight From Politics</h1>

<h4>A Discussion of Contemporary Trend</h4>

<p class="info">From <strong>The New International</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/issue3.htm#ni47_10" target="new">Vol.&nbsp;XIII No.&nbsp;8</a>, October 1947, pp.&nbsp;241&#8211;246.<br />

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%">
<p class="fst">The intellectuals are the most delicate sensorium of the
life of society. In their remarkable ideological fluctuations of the
past 30 years, one can read the history of contemporary society in
oblique, distorted yet revealing terms. Bolshevism and Stalinism;
pacifism and Vansittartism; pragmatism and existentialism; militant
atheism and neo-mysticism; revolutionary activism and secluded quietism
&#8211; the list can be extended indefinitely. A discussion of these shifts
which merely denounces the intellectuals&#8217; &#8220;irresponsibility&#8221; is largely
a waste of time, even if morally or emotionally satisfying. For the
intellectuals&#8217; instability (which at least indicates reaction and
awareness) is largely a reflection of the failure of the major social
classes to resolve the crisis in which we are jutted. Any other view
grants the intellectuals a degree of social independence they do not in
reality enjoy.</p>
<p>The political development of the American &#8220;left&#8221; intellectuals since
the great depression may be charted in four major trends: their
attraction to radical politics in the early thirties; their subsequent
break from Stalinism and turn to Trotskyism; their retreat from Marxism
in the late thirties; and finally their flight from politics in
general. <a id="f1" href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> In this article I
wish to discuss only the last of these trends, the flight from politics.</p>

<p>Though not a class in the Marxian sense, the intellectuals wield an
influence far greater than their direct socio-economic strength.
Because of their characteristic concern with ideas, they are able to
wrench a certain limited freedom from their social milieu; they are not
merely linked to the present, they can &#8220;live&#8221; ideologically in either
the past or the future. To analyze their present situation, we must
therefore not only place them in their general position <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em>
the major classes of society, but go further by examining some of their
ideas.</p>

<p>In few instances have the intellectuals formulated their flight from
politics into an explicit system or rationale, and that only by the
scholastics or academicians. Such a codification is impossible for the
left intellectual whose background is at least partially political. For
it is such a patently absurd idea to suggest that modern men can live
without politics or solve any of his fundamental problems without
politics, that few have had the courage to justify their behavior by a
theoretical elevation. Instead a variety of half-conscious subterfuges
are adopted. One sneers at politics as &#8220;dirty&#8221; &#8211; which is in a sense
true but which skirts the central problem of whether men must sometimes
engage in activities which are &#8220;dirty.&#8221; Another turns to &#8220;ultimate&#8221;

problems of life &#8211; man&#8217;s basic nature, cosmic anxiety, death, &#8220;fear and
trembling&#8221; &#8211; which, whatever their other areas of relevance, are
certainly not a logical substitute, even if an emotional one, for the
problems with which politics is concerned. And still a third says that
politics is &#8220;dull&#8221; by comparison with other intellectual activities &#8211;
which, again, may or may not be true but which is irrelevant if only
because politics recommends itself not for esthetic reasons but by its
claim to be unavoidably <em>necessary</em>. Obviously none of these
subjectively formulated motivations expresses the basic cause for the
flight from politics. For though the intellectuals may develop a
considerable ingenuity in the means by which they negotiate this
flight, its causes are largely rooted in the immediate crisis of
society.</p>

<p>To the intellectuals politics seems to offer no way out; it seems
able only to embroil us further in the current catastrophe. This
feeling is the direct consequence of the failure of the revolutionary
upsurges of the twenties and thirties, the most shattering experience
of our time: shattering to people, to movements and to ideas. An entire
generation of intellectuals was politically destroyed just as virtually
an entire generation of revolutionists was politically destroyed. <a
id="f2" href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>The intellectuals feel themselves trapped in a dead end: the
bifurcation between knowledge and action. They feel that <em>nothing
matters any more</em>; that <em>no matter what one does</em>, one
cannot challenge the political power of omnipotent bureaucracies.
(Kafka&#8217;s novel, <strong>The Trial</strong>, gave anticipatory
expression to this sense of powerlessness in its view of man as a <em>victim</em>.)
In an article by C. Wright Mills, a radical sociologist, the feeling is
vividly described:</p>
<p class="quoteb">We continue to know more and more about modern
society, but we find the centers of political initiative less and less
accessible. This generates a personal malady which is particularly
acute in the intellectual who has labored under <em>the illusion that
his thinking makes a difference</em>. In the world of today the more
his knowledge of affairs grows, the less effective the impact of his
thinking seems to become ... He feels helpless in the fundamental sense
that he cannot control what he is able to foresee. (<em>The Powerless
People</em>, by C. Wright Mills, <strong>Politics</strong>, April,
1944 &#8211; My emphasis &#8211; <em>I.H.</em>)</p>

<p class="fst">Now, honesty requires that we acknowledge that this
feeling is not confined to the intellectuals, the &#8220;powerless people&#8221;;
it is a feeling which must also seize the revolutionist who correctly
analyzes each revolutionary situation only to find in its defeat still
another tragic confirmation of the validity of his analysis. (There is,
by the way, an easy way to avoid this feeling and even to enjoy the
most delicious optimism: simply live in another world ... and chalk up
each defeat of the socialist movement in <em>this</em> world as a
victory in your private world.) But the crucial difference between most
intellectuals and the revolutionists is that the revolutionists
continue to resist reaction; that they have maintained their conviction
of the necessity of political activity; and that they have not elevated
moods of the present into philosophies of presumed universal relevance.
Shortly before the Russian Revolution, Lenin, in a moment of deep
pessimism, told a Swiss audience that he doubted if the Russian
Revolution would come in his lifetime &#8211; which didn&#8217;t prevent him from
trying to nullify his prediction.</p>

<p>There is the greatest weakness of the intellectual: if he responds
most readily to the times, he also succumbs most easily to its
pressures. A glance at the present intellectual situation in America
indicates the extent to which this is true. One need but list a few
indices: the disintegration and atomization of American intellectual
life; the pathetic <em>quest for novelty</em>, often at the expense of
basic relevance and validity; the belittling of science and the
elevation of the irrational; the reappearance of musty theories of
social utopias; the growth of academicism in literary life; the
popularity of the doctrine of man&#8217;s essential and unavoidable isolation.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more alarming than the reappearance of reactionary
ideas is the intellectuals&#8217; loss of <em>rebelliousness</em>. By and
large they have become, at least in a physical-economic sense,
comfortable citizens of the community. Most of them have settled down
during recent years to the security of the good life, even if that good
life is occasionally conscience-torn. Gone is the sensitivity to the
world&#8217;s sufferings which was such an admirable trait of the
intellectuals of 15 years ago. So immersed are they now in <em>man&#8217;s</em>

cosmic suffering that they maintain their silence about the
here-and-now sufferings of <em>men</em>; so fascinated are they by
their private problems that they are indifferent to the social
catastrophe which tortures all humanity. <a id="f3" href="#n3"
name="f3">[3]</a> Or if not indifferent, then helpless and hopeless.
Marx&#8217;s statement that the task of philosophers is no longer to
philosophize about the world but to change it has been amended to read:
&#8220;<em>but to mourn for it</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The directions which this flight takes are many, but in this article
I wish only to note briefly four of them: the turns to religion,
absolute moralism, psychoanalysis and existentialist philosophy as <em>substitutes</em>
for politics. It goes without saying that where literary material is
cited, I intend neither literary analysis nor evaluation.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Turn to Religion</h4>

<p class="fst">That, a substantial group of intellectuals should accept
religious notions as relevant to modern man&#8217;s situation is perhaps the
most striking tendency of contemporary intellectual life. Though the
causes of any individual&#8217;s conversion are often complex and perplexing,
the turn to religion in general is not difficult to explain. Each age
of defeat and dissolution sees similar developments. Where men fail,
miracles are needed; where chaos reigns, men yearn for order. And who
can offer miracles as acceptable or an order as comforting as the
church? Hence the resurgence of religio-emotional primitivism among
sophisticated intellectuals.</p>

<p>The consequences of this turn are enormous. For those who revert to
religion must necessarily break with the entire tradition of modern
thought as it stemmed from the Enlightenment and twisted through the
20th century. The assumptions of rational inquiry and scientific
method; the reliance on intelligence as a means of social
investigation; the conception that man need seek no sanction for his
quest for dignity and meaning outside of himself and that a tragic view
of life is derivable from an acceptance of a naturalistically-ordered
universe which is not a <em>function</em> of some external cosmic
power &#8211; all of these traditional postulates of western thought, which
Marxism accepted the better to drive them to total realization, are now
discarded by the religious converts who can urge only intuition,
mysticism and faith. They abandon not merely Marx and Freud and Dewey
and Einstein and Darwin and all the other names which have become the
symbols of modern thought; they abandon as well the intellectual
progenitors of the bourgeois revolution. They move back beyond the
Encyclopediasts to pre-bourgeois ideology.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the strained attempts of a few &#8220;left&#8221; Catholics and
Protestant socialists to wed religion to some mildly leftist politics,
the large-scale adoption of religion can lead only to passivity and
indifference. How could it be otherwise among men who find this world
so painful that they seek another? <a id="f4" href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>
And though religion does serve as emotional nourishment and a source of
mythic symbolism for individual artists (e.g., the talented young
American poet, Robert Lowell), its general domination of the cultural
scene could lead only to obscurantism, stultification and in some
instances regimentation. For today religion is a hard crust on the
social organism shutting off the breath of freedom, generosity, and experimentation.</p>

<p>The central and most representative figure in the turn to religion
is T.S. Eliot, who helped initiate the trend. Unlike many other
converts, Eliot was never a radical in politics and unlike many others
he has taken his conversion most seriously. He has accepted the
ceremonies and dogmas of Anglo-Catholicism with apparently literal
belief; he has not hesitated before some of its least credible or
savory implications. And he has transmuted church values into his literary
criticism and his politics. When as distinguished and sophisticated an
intellectual as Eliot could write in a manner worthy of a parish priest
announcing an <em>index prohibitorium</em> that</p>

<p class="quoteb">In ages like our own it is necessary for Christian
readers to scrutinize their reading, <em>especially of works of the
imagination</em>, with explicit and theological standards. (<strong>After
Strange Gods</strong>, <em>by</em> T.S. Eliot &#8211; my emphasis, <em>I.H.</em>)</p>

<p class="fst">then the implications of the religious revival for
political and cultural freedom become clearer.</p>
<p>Eliot has even attempted a political application of his religious
doctrine. In his book, <strong>The Idea of a Christian Society</strong>,
he constructed a Christian Utopia which, having been established as a
platonic <em>idea</em>, he held to be more significant than the
worldly reality of church political behavior. He argued that the
practice of church politics is a merely transient <em>aspect</em> of
Christianity while the <em>idea</em> of a Christian society is its
indestructible <em>essence</em>. Just as it is helpless before the
self-contained structure of solipsism, so reason is disarmed by this
bland dismissal of actuality in the name of a formal ideal. In this
instance one can only put aside the <em>idea</em> and insist on an
examination of the reality; one can only place Eliot&#8217;s argument for
what it is: a traditionally-formulated apology for church reaction.</p>

<p>Yet if Eliot represents the most rigidified personification of the
intellectual reaction to which religion must eventually lead,
he still remains a major voice in contemporary poetry. Which should
warn us against too easy correlations between religiosity and cultural
sterility. For despite the occasional intrusion of his dogma, Eliot&#8217;s
poetry still draws, as it usually has, on the emotional tensions of
contemporary life for its major substance.</p>

<p>Few of the other converts to religion have been able to adopt the
faith as rigorously as has Eliot, even when their difficulties led them
to mystical extremes. Such writers as Aldous Huxley and Evelyn Waugh &#8211;
paralleling the philosophical vagaries of Jeans and Eddington &#8211; have
desperately run to the shelters of faith; but even after they entered
God&#8217;s castle they still could not find peace. For none of them has
genuine religious faith. They have a will to faith, a yearning for
faith, a faith in faith, but faith itself they do not have. And though
the skeptical intelligence of such minds as Huxley, Waugh and Isherwood
may even be driven to a conviction of the <em>need</em> for faith, the
quality of faith itself eludes them. Much of the undeliberate pathos of
the later novels of Waugh and Huxley derives from this insistence on a
faith they have not really captured. Their faith is largely <em>verbal</em>:
a chimera which they feel could give them solace if only they could
grasp it.</p>

<p>Huxley&#8217;s conversion indicates still another basis for the escape to
mysticism. Running like a thread of reproach through his novels is a
pervasive fear of life and especially of the modern organization of
life (<strong>Brave New World</strong>, though purporting to satirize a
future Utopia actually described modern society). His fear of life
manifests itself in his equivocal attitude toward sex: in his <strong>Ends
and Means</strong> he urges sexual sublimation for &#8220;the enlargement of
culture.&#8221; Is it any wonder that this writer&#8217;s conversion resulted not
merely in a deterioration of his talent but also a rupture from all the
vital sources of modern life and feeling?</p>

<p>But the most pitiful and in a way terrifying, result of the turn to
religion appears in the poetry of W.H. Auden. Not only does Auden
prostrate himself before his God; he exults in the prostration, in the
utter renunciation of man&#8217;s powers of reason and in the promiscuous
proclamation of man&#8217;s guilt. The brash rebelliousness of his youth is
now twisted into a masochistic abasement before his Lord. In his
talented poem, <em>For the Time Being, a Christmas Oratorio</em>, he brings to ultimate
reduction the surrender and self-denial of the intellectual-in-quandary.</p>

<p class="quoteb">By Him is dispelled the darkness wherein the fallen
will cannot distinguish between the temptation and sin, for in Him we
become fully conscious of Necessity as our freedom to be tempted and of
Freedom as our necessity to have faith. And by Him is illuminated the
time in which our freedom is realized or prevented, for the Course of
History is predictable in the degree to which all men love themselves,
and spontaneous in the degree to which each man loves God and through
Him his neighbor.</p>

<p class="fst">It is Auden as well who urges on modern man the
Calvinistic dogma that:</p>

<table align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="fst">&#8220;... even in<br>
The germ-cell&#8217;s primary division<br>
Innocence is lost and Sin,<br>
Already given as a fact<br>
Once more issues as an Act.&#8221;</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">The religious conversions of the intellectuals have
their low-brow equivalents: Dorothy Sayers and C.S. Lewis, who proclaim
Christianity as a Rotarian dogma equally good for ailing souls and
worldly troubles and who trot out all the theological paraphernalia
(original sin, salvation through redemption) in hearty Salvation Army
style; and finally Lloyd Douglas, who concocts profitable fictional
miracles in the apparent belief that the Bible didn&#8217;t provide enough
with which to write best sellers.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Quest for Morality</h4>

<p class="fst">Yearning for a steady anchor in a terrifyingly
uncontrolled world, a group of intellectuals have turned to absolute
morality as a secular equivalent of the turn to religion. Though each
participant in this quest for the moral grail establishes his own
emphasis, there is one supposition common to all of them: the rejection
of the social matrix of morality and the insistence upon a supra or
extra-historical set of moral values.</p>

<p>Ultimately any sharp dichotomy between &#8220;social&#8221; and &#8220;individual&#8221;
morality must result in confusion, for it tends to polarize &#8220;society&#8221;
and &#8220;the individual&#8221; as unimpinging abstractions. Both extremes fail to
see the individual inextricably <em>in</em> society and society
necessarily composed of individuals; they are hence unable to develop a
dynamic and active view of morality and its context in existence, or as
the current jargon would have it, its existential context. Either
extreme must necessarily lead to a static and passive view of morality.</p>

<p>In practice few people can cling to these extremes. Once, however,
one admits to an interaction of individual and social or rather once
one admits an indivisible coexistence in which both terms are really
short-hand descriptive abstractions of linked aspects of human
existence &#8211; then there is still the main problem: what is the
relationship between these two necessary abstractions and what, if any,
is their causal sequence? Here, I think, Marxism provides a valid and
operationally useful answer: it sees man in context, within limits; <em>it
defines thereby the area of his freedom</em>. (Since it must be based
on complete indeterminacy, &#8220;absolute freedom&#8221; is no longer actual
freedom; there is nothing in relation to which to be &#8220;free.&#8221;)</p>

<p>When Marx said that &#8220;man makes his own history, but not out of the
whole cloth,&#8221; he was, I think, saying something along <em>these</em>
same lines; he was suggesting that the scope of moral action and the
limits within which moral choice is possible are largely conditioned by
the situation in which man finds himself, that is the society in which
man lives. This does not mean that all moral problems are thereby
automatically solved; on the contrary. It does, however, help us to
define them and to test their relevance. Nor does it mean that all
moral problems are <em>reduced</em> to social problems; on the
contrary. It does, however, insist upon that connecting link, with
context without which the moral problem becomes reified and thereby
divorced from human situations.</p>

<p>Now the most interesting thing about the turn to absolute morality
is that, when viewed in historical perspective, it is itself so clearly
conditioned by the very temporal and contingent social conditions from
which it tries to free itself. The attempt to discover again absolute
morality is in the present historical situation clearly a result of the
sense of impotence the intellectuals feel before the social problems of
the world. Were the intellectuals engaged in activity which they felt
would make a difference, they would not try to climb the cliffs of
absolute morality. So there is more than a touch of irony in the fact
that the turn to absolute morality can be explained only by an approach
which is its antithesis.</p>

<p>The source of this tendency in the feeling of social impotence is
vividly described by a socialist writer.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Justice and Truth are capitalized and it is felt that
it might thereby be possible to regain for them a lustre which was
lost, in the daily grind of earthly contact. This reminds one of the
word magic practiced in certain primitive cultures: if a tribesman does
a forbidden thing he constantly cries aloud that he is doing the Good
and Rightful, thus hoping to fool the Gods. The current cry for Justice
and Truth seems to be a related phenomenon; here also word magic
replaces coping with the real world. (<em>Digging at the Roots or
Striking at the Branches?</em> by Louis Clair, <strong>Politics</strong>,
October, 1946.)</p>


<p class="fst">Once, however, the categories of absolute morality have
been established and capitalized, where then? <em>What are the
consequences?</em> To live according to the precepts of this morality?
But that is impossible, literally impossible. The moralist&#8217; must live
in <em>this</em> world, in capitalist society; he must still, like it
or not, behave as a unit of a commodity-producing society. He may
publish a magazine advocating absolute morality, but all the conditions
of his act of publication &#8211; from the cost of printing to his ability to pay his
contributors &#8211; are determined by factors which violate his absolute
morality. He has only three choices: to <em>split himself;</em> to
isolate himself; or to try to change the social conditions in which his
dilemma is rooted. If he chooses the last, then he must become a
politician; and no politician of <em>any</em> sort ever has, ever can
or ever will be able to function according to absolute morality.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that this tendency leads to an impasse for
social activity, it leads to something perhaps as unattractive:
unlimited banality. Thus Dwight Macdonald, the man who went from Karl
Marx to Paul Bunyan, discovers &#8211; hold your breath! &#8211; that people in big
cities are unfeeling and calloused, that in fact cities are too big and
that men should <em>never</em> hurt each other. If Macdonald urges men
to turn the other cheek to society, his co-thinker, Paul Goodman, urges
men simply to ignore society. Goodman tells people to stop working for
wages, to quit their jobs when they find their work uninteresting. He
neglects to mention how people are to eat and feed their children if
they follow his advice, but then no thinker can be expected to make his
system <em>completely</em> foolproof.</p>

<p>The whole matter was once summed up to perfection by Dwight
Macdonald before he departed from this world:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The essence of reactionary politics is to try to get
people to behave in a class society as though it were a classless
society, i.e., <em>to stop &#8220;playing politics.&#8221;</em> (My emphasis &#8211; <em>I.H.</em>)<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Psychology as a Substitute</h4>

<p class="fst">While the turn to religion is an atavistic reaction, the
recent absorption in psychoanalysis by American intellectuals is a more
complex phenomenon. Without question Freudianism is one of the major
achievements of modern culture. We may accept as significant
contributions to our understanding of human life Freud&#8217;s broad insight
into human behavior while rejecting his sociological by-products. (His
specific clinical procedures and methods of therapy should be evaluated
<em>only</em> by specialists.)</p>

<p>The recent glazed fascination with which American intellectuals have
turned to psychoanalysis is, however, not merely an alert reaction to a
powerful theory; it is that, but it is also something else. For if the
turn to religion involves an atavistic reaction, then the recent
fascination with psychoanalysis involves a <em>distention</em> of
materials. In the attempt to make psychoanalysis serve where politics
presumably failed, a number of its less cautious converts have <em>distended
the discipline beyond its proper limits</em>.</p>

<p>This distention takes two forms. First, the exorbitant claims made
for a theory which is essentially a hypothesis for <em>individual</em>
therapy and neither a <em>Weltanschauung</em> nor a method of social
analysis (e.g., the uncritical analogical theory of &#8220;mass neurosis&#8221; of
the German people). Secondly, though less tangibly, the evident element
of morbidity with which the theory is espoused, its use not as a
challenging tool for self-understanding but as a haven from
responsibility and action. The human being becomes a passive and
prostrate victim unable to act or react.</p>

<p>The most extreme distention of psychoanalysis is at present
practiced by the political followers of the analyst, Wilhelm Reich.
Proceeding from the most admirably motives, Reich&#8217;s writing is immersed
in a thoroughly revolutionary spirit which rejects the capitalist
status quo. In his book on fascism, Reich displays a historical sense
not often found among orthodox Freudians: he attempts a correlation
between political authoritarianism and sexual suppression which is
suggestive if not conclusive. Yet the basic political effect of his
writings, whatever their value for therapeutic practice, is to provide
a plausible rationale for the flight from politics.</p>

<p>Reich develops a theory of sexual fabianism: he sees the
authoritarian structures of capitalist society leading to a destruction
of orgastic potency among its citizens. From this theory he concludes
that before people can become genuine revolutionists they must first
restore their orgastic potency; otherwise any revolution would merely
perpetuate in new guise the authoritarian structure of the past and
inhibit the development of free sexuality and the creative
potentialities of mankind.</p>

<p>Even if we accept the hypothesis of an intimate correlation between
political authoritarianism and sexual suppression, there does not at
all necessarily follow its converse: that the achievement of sexual
freedom will make people into, or is an indispensable prerequisite for
people becoming, revolutionists. As has been remarked by critics of
Reich, the tyro of the bedroom is not necessarily the hero of the
barricades ... and vice versa.</p>

<p>In the meantime people attracted to Reich&#8217;s views, especially their
popularization by his enthusiastic followers, find a rationale for
political abstention: they must achieve orgastic potency <em>first</em>,
and one doesn&#8217;t do that overnight, you understand. ... To justify this
abstentionism, they raise the hoary question: how can a party of
neurotics (substitute believers in violence, immoral people, etc.,
etc.) make a really liberating revolution unless its membership is
first sexually liberated?</p>

<p>How, in the light of this question, past revolutions were
accomplished &#8211; revolutions which certainly fulfilled the social tasks
necessary and possible for them (the great French, the Cromwellian, the
American, the Russian) &#8211; the Reichians do not explain. They are forced
into the dilemma either of denying historical validity to all previous
revolutions or of asserting that the parties leading these revolutions
were composed of unneurotic, orgastically potent individuals.</p>

<p>Reich has explicitly repudiated socialist political movements, which
he sees as perpetuating the present authoritarian structures. He <em>calls
upon</em> the proletariat to liberate itself sexually. Whether this
liberation is possible under capitalism and <em>why capitalism is so
bad if it is possible</em> &#8211; these problems confront the Reichians. Is
it not evident then that, whatever its value for
therapy, this theory is a sexual variant of that school of absolute
morality which insists that the individual must save himself before he
can try to change society? Whether the call be to attain the True and
the Good; or to find the Only God; or to achieve sexual freedom, the
result is the same: the substitution of individual redemption for
social revolution. Men are told what to <em>be</em>, not what to <em>do</em>.
And how palatable is this substitution for those in flight from politics!<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Vogue of Existentialism</h4>

<p class="fst">The breathless adoption of existentialism by a number of
American intellectuals is a striking instance of their desperate <em>quest
for novelty</em>. They are not really interested, with honorable
exceptions here and there, in its philosophical aspects, for the appeal
of existentialism is as a mood rather than a doctrine. One must
therefore differentiate between the philosophical school which has
behind it a considerable history and the current Paris-New York vogue.
Whatever the philosophical implications of existentialism &#8211; on which I
am not in a position to comment &#8211; it seems that they are hardly such as
to warrant all the excitement that it has provoked in American
intellectual circles. Nor does one discern in existentialism proposals
for human behavior or social action sufficiently radical or new to
warrant so much excitement.</p>

<p>I have neither the desire nor the training to offer here any sort of
exposition or criticism of existentialism. <a id="f5" href="#n5"
name="f5">[5]</a> But while refraining from such presumption, I think
it is not too risky to say a few words about the existentialist <em>tendency</em>
in so far as it is related to the contemporary intellectual flight from politics.</p>

<p>The reason for the current existentialist vogue is not a sudden
interest in its attempt to upset traditional philosophical edifices;
not, that is, in existentialism&#8217;s views on the traditional
epistemological and ontological systems. Existentialist philosophers
have attempted to deny the relevance of ontological problems as
traditionally formulated &#8211; something which should be familiar enough to
American intellectuals not to cause too much excitement.</p>

<p>The immediate importance of existentialism seems rather social and
psychological: it accurately and <em>dramatically</em> portrays the
moods of an entire generation and it extrapolates these moods from
their social matrix by constructing them into a set of attitudes with
which to counter the conditions from which they arose. In the hands of
the French writers who are currently the most prominent exponents of
existentialism, the theory is largely a matter of developing <em>attitudes
to life</em> (what the man in the street often believes philosophy to
be) rather than dealing with the usual philosophical problems.</p>

<p>In the view of its proponents, the human being is different from all
other beings in that he possesses self-consciousness, he is able to
feel concern about his own being and he must therefore always be aware
of his unavoidable and possibly imminent death. For this reason his
most fundamental attitude to life is &#8220;anxiety.&#8221; As a keen critic of
existentialism, Paul Kesckemeti writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In &#8216;anxiety&#8217; existence comes nearest to a complete
and adequate understanding of itself, because anxiety contains in
itself the most fundamental piece of knowledge that is given to man,
namely, the knowledge that his existence is finite. It is bounded by death.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This sense of the nullity of life as stemming from its
finiteness is expressed by Sartre when he writes that &#8220;every existent
is born without reason, perpetuates itself out of inertia, and dies
fortuitously.&#8221; To this acceptance of life as a journey from void to
void, existentialism, at least in its French version, adds several
other attitudes: man&#8217;s true nature, his &#8220;authenticity,&#8221; is most
thoroughly developed when he squarely and fully confronts his
&#8220;anxiety,&#8221; which is life&#8217;s fundamental <em>heightening</em> condition;
the free individual is thrust into a &#8220;situation&#8221; not of his own making
but he is always able to make a <em>choice</em> in his attitudes and
actions and thereby possesses the freedom to &#8220;engage&#8221; himself. Camus, a
writer associated with the existentialists though not strictly speaking
of them, adds the concept of rebellion as the basis of man&#8217;s dignity
for which the dramatic image is his myth of Sisyphus. He writes of
Sisyphus, the symbol of man, that he</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... is the absurd hero. His scorn of the gods, his
hatred of death, and his passion for life earned him the unspeakable
punishment of his whole being being employed to achieve nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The connection between these attitudes and the dilemma
of the leftist intellectuals within the French resistance during the
occupation &#8211; a dilemma of having to reconcile political resistance with
a fundamental desperation and sense of desolate helplessness &#8211; is well
known and obvious enough. But what I find most striking in these
attitudes of existentialism is that, if taken more in terms of
imaginative projections than as factual descriptions of human
existence, they express as vivid <em>dramatic abstractions</em>
precisely the dilemmas of the intellectuals who feel themselves to be
the &#8220;powerless people.&#8221; That the proponents of existentialism claim
their generalized descriptions of <em>their own historically caused
and limited</em> situation as a description of all human existence is
merely an ironic footnote.</p>

<p>But I think it should be apparent that the obsessive concern with
&#8220;anxiety&#8221; is the result of the historically provoked and <em>multiple</em>
anxieties of contemporary life. Or that the preoccupation with death <em>per
se</em> is the outgrowth of the terrifying domination of recent life by
the <em>death-politics</em> of totalitarian society. One need not go
too far back in history to show that men (as distinct from &#8220;man&#8221;) have
not always felt death to be the dominating fact of their lives; that at
various times men have accepted their death as an event of not too
great moment and certainly as an event which did not make their entire
lives &#8220;absurd&#8221; &#8211; and this <em>after</em> the loss of belief in an
after-life. One need only point to as recent a period as that after the
First World War, when there was a great wave of revolutionary
enthusiasm. It is impossible to imagine the attitudes of existentialism
being as readily accepted then as they are today. (The one country,
Germany, in which existentialism arose and gained some influence during
the twenties was, significantly enough, the most deeply wracked by the
capitalist crisis in Europe.)</p>

<p>If we remain skeptical of existentialism&#8217;s dramatic abstractions as
valid descriptions of life &#8220;in general&#8221; (because we are skeptical of <em>any</em>
descriptions of life &#8220;in general&#8221;), we must still recognize that
existentialism mirrors in conceptual terms the &#8220;alienation&#8221; of the
modern intellectual. Existentialism seems to me essentially a
reflection of a period of social defeat and decay. (Sartre&#8217;s doctrine
of &#8220;engagement,&#8221; while it stresses the need of making choices does not
yet prove the need for taking action.) It too tells man what to be, not
what to do; it is a symptom of our times, related, though indirectly,
to the flight from politics.</p>

<hr class="section" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p class="fst">I have tried to chart briefly a few of the directions of
the flight of the contemporary intellectuals from politics. Once these
tendencies are understood, there is little more to say except this: We
are living in the midst of a terrible cataclysm, the disintegration of
a putrescent society. And the tendencies which have been described here
are the result of this disintegration: the collapse and surrender of
the human intelligence before the terrors of our times.</p>

<p>But if the intellectuals flee from politics, politics pursues them
relentlessly. Ultimately they cannot escape it. Yet it seems reasonably
certain that with one or two exceptions and surprises none of the older
intellectuals (those who reached their maturity in the thirties) can be
expected to resume any sort of active or close relationship with the
socialist movement. If the road away is a smooth and gentle decline,
the road back is uphill and rocky.</p>

<p>What then will happen when the depression bursts in a few years?
Some of the intellectuals will succeed in providing themselves with
relatively comfortable cushions to soften the fall; others will lose
their marginal jobs and seek out the equivalent of WPA if there is one.
But the younger intellectuals of tomorrow, those who are still in
college or beginning their work &#8211; what about them? Here we can expect a
genuine revolutionary ferment, a political rebelliousness which may
result in a new leftward trend.</p>

<p>It is to this group that we look forward with some hope for a new
flowering of revolutionary intellectuals. We cannot expect that so
accomplished or brilliant a group as gravitated to Marxism in the
thirties will appear in the near future. But we can work with small
beginnings: we can try to build the kind of movement which is
sympathetic to the needs and problems of young intellectuals and which
by its democratic nature and its lively and undogmatic attitude to
ideas will be able to attract them. It is in such elements &#8211; one can
already discern the first dim signs of their appearance &#8211; that we can
find a counter-influence to the current flight from politics, a flight
which is perhaps the last chapter in the history of a generation of
American intellectuals.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p class="note"><a id="n1" href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> The reader may
have noticed a shift in focus from &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; to &#8220;left
intellectuals.&#8221; It is really with the latter that I am here concerned,
though to understand their development we shall have to discuss general
intellectual tendencies. It goes without saying that many, perhaps
most, American intellectuals did not participate in the four trends I
have mentioned.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n2" href="#f2" name="n2">2.</a> The most
pathetic evidence of the destruction of an entire revolutionary
generation is the fate of the Loveatone group. This once proud Marxist
tendency committed suicide <em>en masse</em> at the outbreak of the
war, an act which has few precedents in the socialist movement. Of its
three main figures, one, Lovestone, has become a &#8220;think man&#8221; for a
trade union bureaucracy; another, Wolfe, is now a Menshevik who defends
Chiang Kai-shek&#8217;s regime (see <strong>American Mercury</strong>,
August 1947); and the third, Herberg. has been converted to orthodox
Judaism. <em>Tempus fugit</em>, indeed!</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n3" href="#f3" name="n3">3.</a> A revealing
instance is the indifference and silence of the bulk of American
intellectuals about the recent colonial repressions by French and Dutch
imperialism in Indo-China and Indonesia. Fifteen years ago such events
would have evoked an immediate and powerful reaction from at least a
section of the American intellectuals.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n4" href="#f4" name="n4">4.</a> Theoretically
religious converts could attempt to bring God&#8217;s order to earth, as a
few iconoclasts have seen their task; but most of the recent converts
have sought a haven in religion rather than a creed of public action.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n5" href="#f5" name="n5">5.</a> The best brief
account of existentialism of which I am aware is in an article by Paul
Kesckemeti in the March 1947 issue of <strong>Modern Review</strong>.
Other references are: William Barrett&#8217;s pamphlet, published by <strong>Partisan
Review</strong>, which discusses mainly Heidegger, an existentialist
codifier: Hannah Arendt&#8217;s scholarly but difficult article in the
Winter 1946 Issue of <strong>Partisan Review</strong>; and Jean Paul
Sartre&#8217;s fragmentary <strong>Existentialism</strong>, published by
Philosophical Library.</p>
