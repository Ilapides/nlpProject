<p class="fst"><strong>The Other Kingdom</strong><br/>
by David Rousset<br/>
<em>Reynal and Hitchcock. $2.75</em></p>

<p class="fst">Before the war David Rousset was a French intellectual who adhered
to the Trotskyist movement. He weighed 209 pounds. These two
statements may involve a rather odd juxtaposition, but in a moment
you will see the connection.</p>

<p>When the Nazis overran France, Rousset worked in the underground.
He edited bulletins giving news reports to the underground workers
who had no other source of reliable information. He engaged in the
most dangerous and from the Nazi point of view the most unforgiveable
activity of all: he helped the revolutionary socialists who were
making contact with anti-Nazi groups in the German army. When the
Gestapo caught him, Rousset was sent to Buchenwald where he remained
for 16 months until the end of the war.</p>

<p>When Rousset was released he weighed 114 pounds &#8211; and he had
gone through the modern Inferno, that ultimate terror which modern
society has ended in, that terror which is its consummate expression.
<em>Concentration camp</em> &#8211; the Nazis named it well; for it is the
concentration of all the barbaric and retrogressive tendencies of
modern society.</p>

<p><strong>The Other Kingdom</strong> is a brief, fragmentary record of
Rousset&#8217;s experiences and also a beginning toward a sociological
comprehension of the concentration camp. It is an utterly terrifying
and horrible book, even though it does not recount nearly as many
horrors as other reminiscences of former camp inmates. It is rather
uniquely terrifying and horrible because it <em>explains</em>, because
it does not merely see the camps as irrational outbursts of evil
nature. When the Nazi atrocities are seen as part of a calculated
policy of German imperialism, they become the ultimate in terror. For
then we see them as part of <em>this</em> world, as a logical and
necessary development from the disintegration of capitalist society.</p>

<p>Without hesitation I want to say that Rousset&#8217;s book is by all
odds the very best that has been written on the subject; it not
merely shocks, it informs. Without equivocation Rousset places the
concentration camps within the framework of capitalist society. He writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The existence of the camps is a warning. German
society, both because of the strength of its structure and the
violence of the crisis that demolished it, underwent a decomposition
that is exceptional even in the present state of world affairs. But
it would be easy to show that the most characteristic traits of both
the SS mentality and the social conditions which gave rise to the
Third Reich are to be found in many other sectors of world society &#8211;
less pronounced, it is true, and not developed on any such scale as
in the Reich ... It would be blindness &#8211; and criminal blindness, at
that &#8211; to believe that, by reason of any difference of national
temperament, it would be impossible for any other country to try a
similar experiment. Germany interpreted, with an originality in
keeping with her history, the crisis that led her to the
concentrationary universe. But the existence and the mechanism of
that crisis were inherent in the economic and social foundations of
capitalism and imperialism. Under a new guise, similar effects may
reappear tomorrow. There remains therefore a very specific war to be
waged ... And the German anti-Fascists, interned for more than ten
years, should be our valuable comrades in arms in such a fight.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Concentration Camp Bureaucrats</h4>

<p class="fst">The most revealing fact adduced by Rousset is that it was not the
SS alone which inflicted the brutality on the prisoners. It was the
SS which of course represented the actual police power in the prison.
But the acts of brutality &#8211; the beatings, the torture, the <em>routine</em>
misery &#8211; were often left by the SS to their agents among the
prisoners. Within the concentrationees&#8217; ranks there was established
a bureaucracy which, though totally subservient to the SS on top,
still had a great deal of power over the prisoners below. These
bureaucrats gained special privileges: they had more food, they did
not have to work and they had the delicious privilege of beating the
wretches who were their fellow prisoners. Even among the damned there
arose distinctions of rank and privilege!</p>

<p>The SS knew what it was doing. It understood that where hunger and
misery were prevalent, it could secure for itself the loyalty of a
section of those subjected to this hunger and misery by slightly
alleviating its plight. The SS was following the age-old policy of
ruling classes: divide and rule; but it was following it in a
particularly terrible and inhuman situation.</p>

<p>The prisoners themselves were prevented from establishing genuine
solidarity. How could men who worked like beasts from dawn to dusk,
who were perpetually concerned above all else with dreaming of more
bread and avoiding the lash and the fist &#8211; how could men reduced to
this condition effectively develop a sense of solidarity?</p>

<p>Distinctions of nationality, of camp rank, of politics were all
exploited by the SS to get groups of prisoners off against each other
like raging beasts.</p>

<p>But the main distinction within the ranks of the prisoners was
between the greens and the reds: The greens were the vast majority of
prisoners, the criminal and flotsam and jetsam the Nazis had picked
up, while the reds were of course the politicals. (By the time
Rousset arrived in Buchenwald most of the German anti-Nazi prisoners
had been killed off.) Between the greens and the reds a deadly
struggle broke out for control of the camp administration. The Nazis
tended to favor the greens because they were more &#8220;trustworthy&#8221;
and less scrupulous, but the reds had one decisive advantage: they
were better organized and more efficient. And in many camps there
were labor projects to be organized and work quotas to be reached; as
a result the politicals gained control of some camp administrations
toward the end of the war.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Intercamp Morality</h4>

<p class="fst">It should not be imagined that the politicals in any way resisted
the Nazis when they came to &#8220;power&#8221; in the camp administration.
Had they indicated the slightest attempt in that direction, they
would have been immediately murdered off. Such a move would have
simply been a gesture of suicide. For the politicals to take over
camp administration meant to follow the basic orders of the Nazis &#8211;
work quotas, overall discipline, etc. &#8211; but allowed them to
circumvent the Nazis on other matters. They could treat their fellow
prisoners somewhat more humanely than did the brutal greens; they
could try to save an occasional prisoner whom the Nazis had picked
out for destruction. It was a bitter choice with which the to in
politicals were confronted: cooperate, a sense, with the Nazis in
order to ease the lot of the prisoners and save some of their skins
or to adopt the gestures of absolute morality and commit suicide <em>en masse</em>.</p>

<p>In an excerpt from a forthcoming book by Rousset which continues
his fascinating discussion of the concentration camps in greater
detail (printed in the latest issue of <strong>Politics</strong>) he discusses
this problem. At one point a camp administration of politicals faced
the problem of trying to save a group of 37 men whom the Nazis had
brought to the camp with the evident intention of murdering them. The
politicals decided that at most they could save three of the 37: a
bitter choice but under the circumstances unavoidable! To talk of
morality or moral choice under such conditions seems nonsense; there
was a certain very narrow choice but it lacked the basis in freedom
without which morality becomes meaningless. The truth is that the
conditions of life in the camp <em>forced</em> the prisoners to choose
between wretched and miserable evils; the only way to avoid this was
death. And if one believed, as did the politicals, that they
represented an important cadre for the post-Hitler period, then death
was a <em>luxury</em> &#8211; I mean that literally &#8211; which they could
not afford.</p>

<p>This is one of the questions which Rousset discusses in his book.
There are others, equally fascinating: why didn&#8217;t the Nazis kill
the concentrationees off immediately? Why did they kill them off
gradually and slowly? But I shall stop here. I think enough has been
said in this review to indicate to readers, the absolute
indispensability of this little book to anyone who is in any way
concerned with the problems of our time.</p>

<h4>*</h4>

<p class="fst">For Rousset&#8217;s book I have only the greatest admiration. For his
talents as a writer, for the portrait of himself as a human being
which emerges from the book I also have admiration. It might
therefore seem best to end this review by expressing the humility
which we in America must feel toward those European comrades who have
suffered as has Rousset.</p>

<p>Yet I should be avoiding a very important responsibility if I were
to do that. The unfortunate and sad truth is &#8211; how terribly painful
it is to say this! &#8211; that Rousset&#8217;s book leaves one wondering
about one essential question: Stalinism. Were it merely mere
difference of opinion on some tactical question, it would be best in
reviewing <em>this</em> book to remain silent. But on Stalinism one cannot.</p>

<p>Rousset praises the heroism of the German Stalinist prisoners.
That is understandable; no doubt they were heroic. But there is
nowhere in his book, which discusses the Stalinists if only in
passing, the slightest suggestion of a fundamental and critical
opposition to the Stalinist movement. He writes of them as if they
were &#8220;the Communists&#8221; rather than as a movement in the service of
a totalitarian state as vile as that of the Nazis and one which
maintains to this day concentration camps as terrible as those of the
Nazis. What makes this silence even more disturbing is the reports
which have come from France about theories developed by the group of
intellectuals to which Rousset adheres &#8211; theories about Stalinism
representing the revolution, even if the &#8220;bureaucratically&#8221;
consummated revolution. Such theories, we say categorically, can only
result in the death of whatever hope there is for the reconstitution
of a genuine socialist movement.</p>

<p>I do not wish to make any accusations. I do not know. But the
conjunction of this strange ambiguity in Rousset&#8217;s book and the
reports about his group make for a highly disturbing situation. For a
man like Rousset, with his background, his talents and his sense of
humanity, to express <em>in the slightest degree</em> any deviation
from his previous anti-Stalinism would be nothing short of tragic.</p>

<p>I hope my uneasiness on this matter is unwarranted. But I think
this uneasiness cannot be dissipated until Rousset speaks out plainly
and frankly.</p>
