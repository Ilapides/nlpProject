<p class="fst">Readers familiar with the American radical movement, will remember
Will Herberg. During its short-lived existence, the Lovestone group
(them&ldquo;right&rdquo; Communists) found in Herberg one of its<SUP>
</SUP>theoreticians. As such he was noted for a certain intellectual,
nimbleness, if not profundity.</p>

<p>When the Lovestone group committed suicide at the beginning of the
war by a mass dissolution, virtually all of its people retired from
socialism entirely. Many of them discovered that life as an appointe
official of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union could be
quite comfortable; and since the Social Democratic leadership of that
union has a liking for ex-revolutionists cynical enough to work in
its hire, it found jobs for the Lovestonites. For an
EX-revolutionist, it can always find a job.</p>

<p>Herberg maintained his quiet existence as a minor bureaucrat until
recently, when he resumed literary activity. He gravitated, naturally
enough, to Dwight Macdonald&rsquo;s <B>Politics</B>, where he
participated in that magazine&rsquo;s massed flight from
revolutionary socialism with an essay urging the substitution of
religious values for science. And now he has come out with a
full-fledged statement, <I>From Marxism to Judaism</I>. (<B>Commentary</B>,
January 1947)</p>

<p>The title tells the story perfectly, and it is such a truly
pitiful &ndash; I mean that literally: truly pitiful &ndash;
performance that it might be charitable to pass the article by in
silence. Yet if only by its embarrassing extremity, it should provide
a sobering check for those intellectuals toying, in one way or
another, with religious conceptions. For Herberg&rsquo;s article
reads as if deliberately written to provide an illustration for John
Dewey&rsquo;s attack on the modern flight from science and reason,
and as a contemporary instance of a perennial phenomenon in periods
of political reaction. Who, familiar with the history of the
socialist movement, can read this frank call for supernatural values
without remembering the &ldquo;God Seekers,&rdquo; who, after the
defeat of the 1905 Russian Revolution, abandoned socialist politics
and went off in search of absolute Godliness?</p>

<p>How else is one to explain such atavistic nonsense as Herberg&rsquo;s
declaration that &ldquo;the affirmation of freedom of the individual
person can be grounded in nothing less ultimate than the belief that
he. is created in the image of God&rdquo;? This is the final
wretched, pitiful instance of the intellectuals retreat; and if we
note the moral, believe us that it is not to crow, but rather to
point to this caricature of the trend in order to make clearer its
meaning.</p>
