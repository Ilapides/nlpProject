<h4>A Rejoinder to Erber&#8217;s Criticism</h4>

<p class="fst"><a href="../../../erber/1947/01/howe.html" target="new">Ernest Erber&#8217;s polemic</a> in the January 1947 issue of <strong>The New International</strong> against my <a href="../../1946/09/newcourse.html" target="new"><em>Reviewing the <strong>New Course</strong></em></a> (<strong>Op. Cit.</strong>, September &#8217;46) unquestionably represents the opinion of the majority of our movement. But in largely ignoring the
specific questions my article raised and concentrating his salvoes on
my &#8220;idealist&#8221; historical method, he has shifted the discussion
from the specific issue &#8211; what he calls &#8220;those aspects of the
methods and policies of the Revolution which facilitated its
strangulation at the hands of the bureaucracy&#8221; &#8211; and has forced
me, in this brief rejoinder, to plunge in after him into the depths
of historiography.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>1) In and Out of Context &#8211; How to Approach the Past</h4>

<p class="fst">Erber takes me to task for writing that one can examine an
historical work by attempting a &#8220;placement of oneself in the
context in which it was written&#8221;; and that one can also examine the
past with a full consciousness that the examination is colored by
subsequently acquired experiences and knowledge. He finds it
&#8220;<em>amazing</em>&#8221; that I should call the effort to &#8220;move
backwards in time and imagine ourselves in a situation of the past&#8221;
both &#8220;never successful&#8221; and &#8220;self-contradictory.&#8221; He is
unwilling to admit to legitimacy any method which does not squarely
place itself &#8220;in the context&#8221; of the period under study and he
has himself a bit of fun with queries as to when one approaches a
period of history &#8220;in&#8221; or &#8220;out&#8221; of context; whether there is
any value from my point of view to a method admittedly
self-contradictory, etc.</p>

<p>I think Erber&#8217;s complaint misaddressed; he should rail against
the practise of history in general rather than my attempt at it. For
the two methods of which I spoke are merely variants of emphasis &#8211;
degrees of recognition of distance &#8211; in any historical examination
conducted some time later than the period under study. One may and
should attempt to &#8220;place oneself&#8221; in the context of the period
understudy, to imagine one&#8217;s attitudes if in So-and-So&#8217;s shoes;
but that attempt can never be quite successful, for it is impossible
to eradicate ideas and experiences absorbed from events that took
place after the period under study. But suppose such an attempt were
possible, suppose one <em>could</em> step into the attitudes, opinions
and limitations of a figure of the past. How could one learn anything
that way? All one would know would be what that person knew then. To
draw lessons from his experience, the use of subsequently acquired
data is essential. For it is not only the past which helps illuminate
the present; <em>it is also the present which illuminates the past</em>.
Erber&#8217;s apparent failure to take the latter half of this reciprocal
relationship into consideration is the major cause of most of his
objections to my methodology.</p>

<p>In <em>any</em> historical study one admits the unavoidable fact of
hindsight, second-guessing and subsequently accrued knowledge and
opinions. This recognition is legitimate so long as it doesn&#8217;t
result in moralistic judgments where the belief in present superior
conceptions is based on knowledge that was unavailable to those judged.</p>

<p>When Erber therefore asks: &#8220;If it (the attempt to view in
context) cannot be done successfully and if the effort is
self-contradictory, of what value is it?&#8221;, he is really questioning
not my statement of the limitations of the &#8220;in context&#8221; approach.
but rather the efficacy of historical criticism in general. For it is
obvious that I couldn&#8217;t have and didn&#8217;t question the need of
<em>trying</em> to &#8220;imagine ourselves in a situation of the past.&#8221;
Were that attempt not made, historical criticism would <em>literally</em>
be impossible. I was rather suggesting the <em>limits</em> of that
attempt and therefore the need frankly to take those limits into
account as part of the data of one&#8217;s historical examination, as
well as to acknowledge that sometimes such recognition of limits is a
positive advantage. (This recognition is common to all scientific
methodology, especially in the social sciences, and is sometimes
called the inclusion of the experimenter in the experiment.) As for
the problem of which emphasis to underscore at a given time, that
depends on the <em>purpose</em> of the investigation: a study of the
possible alternatives facing Trotsky in his struggle must attempt to
confine itself to the then available data, but a study of the lessons
that struggle has for us today can range beyond the context of the
then experiences and take into account subsequently developed
knowledge and ideas. That somewhat variant results would necessarily
follow from either emphasis is as obvious in the field of
historiography as is the fact that the <em>position</em> &#8211; both
spatial and ideological &#8211; of an astronomer has a bearing on the
data and results of his experiment.</p>

<p>That Erber should find these quite obvious notations on historical
method &#8220;amazing&#8221; is itself ... amazing.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>2) The Strange Appearance of Thomas Carlyle</h4>

<p class="fst">The main purpose of my article was to try to note &#8211; through an
examination of his <strong>The New Course</strong> where they appear in
incipient but clear form &#8211; what seem certain errors in Trotsky&#8217;s
approach to the struggle of the Left Opposition against Stalinism.
These errors which manifested themselves in an underestimation of the
need to propagate the idea of <em>soviet democracy</em>, later formed
the basis of his untenable views in favor of defending Stalinist
totalitarianism in its imperialist war and labeling it a &#8220;workers&#8217;
state.&#8221; These boiled down to his insistence that Russia faced only
two alternatives: either return to a genuine working class
revolutionary regime or to be led <em>by the Stalinist bureaucracy</em>
to the return of capitalism, that is, private property. But neither
alternative was realized; something else, a third variant, took
place: Stalin didn&#8217;t restore private property but rather maintained
and protected nationalized property while simultaneously instituting
a privileged bureaucratic totalitarianism. The main tack of my
article was to determine the consequences of Trotsky&#8217;s failure to
see the <em>possibility</em> (<em>not</em> the inevitability) of such a
variant. Such a determination of consequences involves no
retrospective judgment; if accurate, it is merely a statement of fact.</p>

<p>However, and secondarily, I also wrote that &#8220;it does not seem
absurd to ask why Trotsky didn&#8217;t see what took ordinary mortals
twenty additional years to see.&#8221; For saying this, Erber finds me
guilty of a &#8220;Carlylian theory of the man of genius.&#8221; I think he
is wrong for at least two reasons:</p>

<p class="fst">a) It was physically and historically <em>possible</em> for Trotsky
to have foreseen the possibility of an indigenous bureaucratic
totalitarianism maintaining nationalized property. That is why his
charge that I was urging the use of &#8220;tanks at Waterloo&#8221; is
invalid. It was literally impossible under the then social and
scientific conditions to use tanks at Waterloo; but it was not
analogously impossible for Trotsky to have had a more valid
conception in the period from the opening of the struggle until
Stalin&#8217;s consolidation of power.</p>

<p class="fst">b) The question of whether Trotsky &#8220;<em>should</em> have foreseen
the possibility of bureaucratic collectivism&#8221; was not raised by me
with an eye to passing a moralistic judgment. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
I tried to establish the possibility of such foresight by Trotsky in
order to examine the consequences of his not foreseeing. This is not
a &#8220;should&#8221; statement.</p>

<p>In any case Erber&#8217;s venture in historiography in describing my
views as Carlylian is inaccurate. My views may be wrong but they are
not Carlylian. For Carlyle would have declared that Trotsky, if a
&#8220;great&#8221; enough man, would have pushed through to triumph. Carlyle
virtually denied social limitations on individuals and insisted on
the history-making powers of great men. I considered, rather,
Trotsky&#8217;s understanding of the situation, but never said that no
matter how perfect his understanding, he could have surmounted the
historical limitations of his situation in Russia.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>3) Democracy and Revolution &#8211; The Central Question</h4>

<p class="fst">Wherever Erber drops his adumbrations on historical method, he
says a few words about the problems I raised, but in a manner that
can only be described as skittish. From the context of his article
one suspects that he too feels that these problems require
consideration and that some of the comparatively simple answers with
which we contented ourselves in the past no longer suffice; and so he
fulfills his task as defender of orthodoxy with more relish when he
can wander in the mazes of historiography than when he turns to the
Russian experience itself. However, a few of his remarks on the
latter are of interest:</p>

<p class="fst">a) Erber charges that I didn&#8217;t sufficiently consider that not
only bureaucratic degeneration, but also capitalist restoration, was
a danger.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Howe&#8217;s method,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;leads to an
<em>indiscriminate</em> rejection of everything that proved of value to
Stalin in his fight for power. Implicit in this is the danger that
the indiscriminate attempt to avoid the risk of bureaucratic
degeneration can lead to disarming the revolution in the face of the bourgeoisie.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Exactly what &#8220;an <em>indiscriminate</em> rejection of EVERYTHING
that proved of value to Stalin&#8221; means I do not know; nor, I
suspect, does anyone else; it is, however, an &#8220;<em>impressive&#8221;
statement</em>. Disciplined organization, for example, proved of value
to Stalin; by what process of ratiocination can Erber prove that my
remarks led to a rejection of disciplined organization. Such
emotively charged but difficult-to-prove charges do not add light to
the polemic.</p>

<p>But, more important, I wish to challenge Erber&#8217;s implication &#8211;
his <em>central</em> implication &#8211; that the emphasis on a democratic
struggle to prevent bureaucratic degeneration would have led to
&#8220;disarming the revolution in the face of the bourgeoisie.&#8221; For it
seems to me that every democratic measure calculated to oppose
bureaucratic degeneration would have simultaneously strengthened the
resistance of the most advanced and conscious revolutionary elements
to the danger of capitalist restoration.</p>

<p class="fst">b) Erber is willing to grant that mistakes were made by Trotsky,
but he insists that, if an examination of them is to have any value,
they must be &#8220;traced back to flaws in Trotsky&#8217;s theoretical
conceptions.&#8221; So he suggests that we decide Trotsky underestimated
the danger of prohibiting factions in 1920 and that this error flowed
from &#8220;his conception of the relationship of democracy to
centralism,&#8221; then &#8220;we must proceed to rectify our conception of
this problem ...&#8221; <em>By all means ... but not enough.</em> For
errors flow <em>not only</em> from theoretical conceptions; such an
opinion betrays a far too formalized and rationalistic conception of
history. Errors flow concretely from the emergence of current
contingencies to which theoretical conceptions may be inappropriately
applied or may no longer be relevant and often from the fact that new
theoretical conceptions cannot be evolved in sufficient time. Which
is why I, for one, would be far less interested in any revision of
the formal conception of the relation of democracy to centralism
(&#8220;the rules&#8221;) than in the open, frank admission of past mistakes
and the <em>real</em> emphasis and orientation of our present thinking.</p>

<p class="fst">c) Erber questions my suggestion of a possible bloc between the
Trotskyists and the Bukharin Right Opposition after the latter became
the target of Stalinist suppression. He offers three arguments:</p>

<p class="arg">Such a bloc would have been legitimate only if &#8220;bureaucratic
collectivism was inevitable&#8221; and &#8220;capitalist restoration could
never be realized.&#8221; Ergo, my argument means that bureaucratic
collectivism was inevitable. But nothing of the kind is true. The
possibility of such a bloc &#8211; leaving aside tactical considerations
irrelevant to this discussion &#8211; was justified not because
bureaucratic collectivism was &#8220;inevitable&#8221; but because by 1930 it
was much <em>more</em> of a danger than capitalist restoration, which
became, after a while, a Stalinist-inflated bogeyman to inhibit all
oppositions.</p>

<p class="arg">Such a bloc Erber sees as &#8220;fantastic&#8221; because the Rights were
lithe most rabid anti-Trotskyists in the party.&#8221; But so were
Zinoviev and Kamenev rabid anti-Trotskyists and Trotsky didn&#8217;t
hesitate to consummate a bloc with them <em>after</em> their break with
Stalin. A bloc is not an ideological agreement; it is an agreement
for certain specific objectives, in this case first and foremost the
joint defense against Stalinist repression.</p>

<p class="arg">Finally, Erber trots out what seems to me by now the old chestnut
about the Right Opposition being &#8220;capitalist restorationist.&#8221;
What does that characterization mean? If seriously and literally
applied, it means that a victory for the Right Opposition would have
led to a capitalist restoration. Is that view now tenable? If so,
Erber would have been logically required to support Stalin&#8217;s
expulsion of Bukharin from the Russian Communist Party, even if
disapproving Stalin&#8217;s methods. And Erber should have himself an
interesting time explaining what Trotsky meant when he wrote in 1938
that &#8220;the Right group of the old Bolshevik Party, seen from the
viewpoint of the bureaucracy&#8217;s interests and tendencies,
represented a <em>Left</em> danger.&#8221; But if Erber means merely that a
Right Opposition victory might have increased the danger of
capitalist restoration, he has still to explain why a bloc for the
joint defense against the encroaching Stalinist terror and for at
least a return to internal party democracy, would have favored the
Right as against the Trotskyists.</p>

<p class="fst">d) One of my central points was that the problem of democracy can
now be seen to have been the pivotal question of the Russian
experience. Erber then asks the me: why were not the &#8220;anarchists,
Left Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks correct on this question
as against Trotsky? ... Even if we assume that their program would
not have led to Stalinism, was it preferable to risk a bourgeois
counter-revolution? Would a Russian Gallifet (a Russian Himmler was
more likely) have been preferable to a Yagoda?&#8221;</p>

<p>No, neither a Gallifet nor a Himmler was preferable to a Yagoda;
but <em>neither was a Yagoda preferable to a Gallifet or a Himmler</em>.
Why does Erber insist on this choice? Why does he assume that when
one believes soviet democracy to have been the &#8220;burning question&#8221;
and Trotsky, even though its great historical defender, to have made
certain mistakes, that such an opinion has anything in common with
the belief that the anarchists, SR&#8217;s and Mensheviks were right &#8220;as
against Trotsky&#8221; ... especially when my article specifically
indicated that I believed them wrong. For these groups went beyond
the bounds of soviet democracy; they took up arms against the soviet
state-that has always been the traditional Bolshevik answer to the
criticism against their suppression, with which my article registered
agreement. Why does a belief that Trotsky made certain errors mean
support of the Mensheviks?</p>

<p>It is true that, as Erber says, one cannot draw up in advance
statutes of limitations. But the recognition of the errors of the
past, even while defending the general historical legitimacy of
Trotskyism, does serve to orient us for the future, even if it gives
us no &#8220;statutes.&#8221; It rein forms us that democracy is an
inalienable aspect of a workers&#8217; state, that the preservation of
democracy is a central task of the revolutionary vanguard in such a
state, that no parties basically loyal to a workers&#8217; state should
be suppressed no matter how harsh their criticism, and that for
proper workers&#8217; democracy all workers&#8217; parties must be
subordinate and responsible to the soviet or council which is the
supreme organ of workers&#8217; rule. To say this is not yet to say what
is going to happen; but it is to make a statement of what we <em>want</em>
to do.</p>

<h4>*</h4>

<p class="fst">I do not believe that my article was a definitive statement on the
problem or that it was even a sufficient beginning. It was rather an
expression of concern with some of the things in Trotsky&#8217;s book,
<strong>The New Course</strong>, as reflections of his historical role. Since
my piece was in the nature of a &#8220;flyer,&#8221; it was necessarily
speculative. Erber, who has assumed the mantle of the more
traditional point of view, agrees however that, even if I am guilty
of all the &#8220;errors&#8221; he has enumerated, a serious consideration of
the problem is necessary. Very well, then. At least he <em>sees</em>
the problem. I hope. that he will therefore not content himself
merely with exposing my methodological &#8220;errors&#8221; &#8211; a task
comparable to Sisyphus&#8217; burden &#8211; but will himself directly
approach the problem.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />

<h3>Footnote</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> Which is why
Erber&#8217;s insistence that my approach must lead to a denigration of
Trotsky&#8217;s genius &#8211; since, you see, Trotsky didn&#8217;t foresee what
happened &#8211; is at best irrelevant, unless he is trying to suggest,
or imply that I suggested, that geniuses never make mistakes. Can&#8217;t
Erber&#8217;s strictures against me on this point just as well be used
against him for criticizing Trotsky for maintaining the &#8220;workers&#8217;
state&#8221; theory, and have not the Cannonites done so?</p>

<p class="note">Be it noted that Erber assigns the word &#8220;should&#8221; to me: it is
not so used in my article.</p>
