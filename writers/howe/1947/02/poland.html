<p class="fst">Enough time has passed since the elections in Poland to form an
estimate of what happened in that Stalinist-dominated land. Since we
have, in past columns, tried to offer an analysis of the Polish
situation, and <B>Labor Action</B> has printed the highly informative
dispatches of A. Rudzienski, we shall here restrict ourselves to a
few points:</p>

<p>The extent of the totalitarian farce, the open and cynical
disregard for the most simple democratic procedures, becomes clearer
after a perusal of the dispatches from Warsaw. The
Stalinist-dominated government published &ldquo;election results&rdquo;
which allowed the opposition a little more than 10 per cent of the
total vote cast. Yet it was a generally accepted estimate that the
opposition had the support of the overwhelming majority of the
population. Proof of this is best seen in the dispatches of even
those correspondents most sympathetic to the Stalinist government. As
starry-eyed a fellow-traveler as Stephen Laird of the <B>New Republic</B>
wrote in that magazine that <i>&ldquo;... a number of observers,
including some high neutral officials, say that though the Peasant
Party might have won 85 per cent of the votes three months ago in a
free election, today it would have won no more than 70 per cent.&rdquo;</I>
Let us grant that: but let us also notice that between the 70 per
cent it would have won in a free election and the 10 per cent it was
allowed by the government there is a rather considerable difference
...</p>

<p>If further proof of the totalitarian nature of the election is
desired, we can turn to the pages of the British <B>New Statesman and
Nation</B>, a Stalinoid magazine similar to the <B>New Republic</B>
in this country. Its Warsaw correspondent, Doreen Warriner, who falls
over herself with clumsy enthusiasm for the Stalinists, is still
forced to write that:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;Mikolajczyk, though far less popular than he
was a year ago, still has a large following; and, if all governmental
pressures were removed, would probably get a majority.&rdquo;</I></p>

<p class="fst">(The Laird dispatch, incidentally, contains an interesting
interview with Mikolajczyk, Peasant Party leader. When Laird asked
him if he agreed that as many government followers were beaten up by
his supporters as were his people beaten by government agents,
Mikolajczyk replied: <i>&ldquo;This is possible, but the difference
is that our people are beaten up in jail.&rdquo;</I>)</p>

<p>By allowing the opposition a mere 10 per cent of the vote, the
Stalinist government was openly flaunting its determination not to
take democratic procedures seriously; it was as if it were saying
that it intended to maintain its rule regardless of what the Polish
masses desired.</p>

<p>What was the actual vote cast in the elections? It is impossible
to say, for thousands were forced to cast &ldquo;open ballots.&rdquo;
Workers in factories were marched <I>en masse</I> to the polls and
there government ballots were distributed to them. Since in such
situations the government is very often his direct employer, it
requires more than a little courage for a worker to vote against it.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that wherever the opposition was
permitted watchers at the counting &ndash; only a small minority of
election booths &ndash; the results were favorable to it. Sydney
Gruson reports in the <B>New York Times</B> of January 24, 1947,
that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;... <I>in thirty-five booths where watchers
witnessed the entire day&rsquo;s voting and counting, Mikolajczyk&rsquo;s
party gathered</I> <I>33,669 against 20,809. The coincidence of a
majority for the PSL (opposition Peasant Party) in almost every booth
where they had watchers seems too strong to dismiss lightly.&rdquo;</I></p>

<p class="fst">Under the circumstances the statement of Zygmunt Zulawski, veteran
Socialist leader who has remained in opposition to the Stalinist
regime, that the government bloc&rsquo;s election methods were
comparable with <i>&ldquo;those used by &lsquo;the fascist regime&rsquo;.&rdquo;</I>
(<B>N.Y. Times</B>, Feb. 9, 1947) is a masterpiece of understatement.</p>

<p>But it is unnecessary to belabor the obvious. As must be the case
with any election held by a Stalinist totalitarian government, the
elections were a complete fake. Now that this parody has been
finished, the Stalinist leaders in Poland have made it plain that
they intend to tighten the governmental reigns and crack down even
harder on any opposition that threatens their rule. They are
continuing to label all oppositionists as fascist though, as A.
Rudzienski&rsquo;s article in last week&rsquo;s <B>Labor Action</B>
demonstrates, that is by no means the case. A statement by the
Stalinist leader, Hilary Mine, threatening severe measures against
any continuation of opposition, clearly indicates an increasing
totalitarianization.</p>

<p>Yet it seems unlikely that the Stalinists will quickly or easily
succeed. The Polish food situation remains very bad. The magazine
<B>World Report</B> estimates that:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;Food shortages may become serious in Poland
this spring after UNRRA ends its work. The autumn harvest of 1946 was
expected to make Poland generally self-sufficient in food, but recent
reports from agricultural areas have been less optimistic. Crop
estimates are being scaled down.&rdquo;</I></p>
