<p class="fst"><strong>The Moon Is Down</strong><br />
by John Steinbeck<br />
<em>Viking Press, New York. $2.00</em></p>

<p class="fst">Cheapness and bad taste are repulsive regardless of their literary application. But when they are characteristic of a book which deals with a theme so close to the sensitivities and passions of contemporary life &#8211; the struggle in underground Europe against the Nazi conquerors &#8211; there is no language too harsh with which to criticize the writer.</p>

<p>Nobody expects anything better from Hollywood. When &#8220;Joan of Paris&#8221; or &#8220;Mr. X&#8221; or John Garfield defeat the Gestapo single-handed, there is at least that opiatic compensation which is the major reason for the great popularity of the motion pictures. But when Steinbeck writes a novel about the underground in exactly the same preciously stylized grotesquerie as when writing of Georgie and the rabbits, anyone with a modicum of literary taste and a flicker of sensitivity must be instantly repelled.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no better way to describe this novel than by comparing it with a certain type of motion picture in which the hero &#8211; say, some aggressively masculine type like Tyrone Power &#8211; beats up seven or eight villains in a violent rough-and-tumble &#8211; and then proceeds to kiss the heroine with his profile about three inches from the camera, his hair immaculately spiffed, not a scratch on his Lux Toilet Soap skin and not a tear in his English worsted suit.</p>

<p>This novel has a theatrical cheapness that is positively appalling. Imagine, if you will, a small town Norwegian mayor (we are not sure that it is Norway; Steinbeck is incapable of making anything concrete or real) who goes to his death at the hands of the Nazis ... reciting Socrates&#8217; final speech!</p>

<p>(What an effective third act curtain!)</p>

<p>Steinbeck is unable to etch one real, living character. They are all abstractions, types, puppets: the slow, but heroic mayor who is the &#8220;personification of freedom&#8221;; the small town philosopher of whose wisdom we are, fortunately, not given any samples; the cracked-up Nazi lieutenants (has anyone ever written a war book in which the lieutenants didn&#8217;t crack up?); the fanatical Norwegian woman whose husband has been shot by the Nazis ...</p>

<p>When three of these presumably Norwegian youths make their way secretly to England, they are given an anti-appeasement speech by the mayor which might have been written by Mike Gold in one of his sober moments!</p>

<p>There is no hint in this book of the motivations which might impel resistance to the Nazi conquerors. What does this &#8220;freedom&#8221; mean to these Norwegian people? Why is the local grocer a Quisling?</p>

<p>It is all enacted in the realm of airy abstractions and wordy pomposities &#8211; about as lifelike and individual as a Stalinist manifesto calling for a second front in Europe. Edmund Wilson some time ago pointed out that Steinbeck has a fatal inability to create real characters, that all his figures are vegetarian abstractions. But when this crucial literary inability is topped off by a theatrical vulgarity ...</p>

<p>Somewhere or other Steinbeck has read that a &#8220;good style&#8221; consists of writing &#8220;lean, nervous sentences.&#8221; He therefore writes &#8220;lean, nervous sentences,&#8221; with the result that his style is as preciously self-conscious as that of a high school sophomore trying to imitate Hemingway.</p>

<p>Well, it is all a colossal literary fraud which will be (and already has been) hailed by every critic and woman&#8217;s club in the country and will probably make a small fortune for Steinbeck, which is probably as good a reason as any for writing this book.</p>
