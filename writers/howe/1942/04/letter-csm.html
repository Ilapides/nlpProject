<p class="c"><strong>The following letter has been sent to the editor of the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em>:</strong></p>

<h4>*</h4>

<p class="fst"><strong>Dear Editor:</strong></p>

<p class="fst">May I, as managing editor of <strong>Labor Action</strong>, one of the periodicals attacked in E.H. Markham&#8217;s article in your issue of March 26, 1942, say a few words in reply?</p>

<p>I do not wish to comment on Mr. Markham&#8217;s general thesis other than to say that it is a dangerous denial of the basic liberties guaranteed by the Bill of Rights &#8211; There is nothing incongruous about radicals fighting to preserve civil rights, such as freedom of speech, while simultaneously attacking the capitalist economic system; on the contrary, we believe that the capitalist system is a hindrance to and eventual destroyer of democratic liberties and that it is only in the struggle for socialism that such liberties may be fully realized.</p>

<p>I am here, however, concerned with matters of far graver importance. It seems to me both slanderous and an instance of questionable journalistic ethics (especially for so generally careful a newspaper as the <strong>Christian Science Monitor</strong>) to assert that <strong>Labor Action</strong> takes a &#8220;neutral attitude&#8221; toward fascism, Hitlerism or Japanese imperialism.</p>

<p><strong>Labor Action</strong> and its supporters were struggling against fascism when many others advised an ostrich policy. We were in the lead in the famous anti-Nazi demonstration at Madison Square Garden in February 1938. We were fighting against fascism when Winston Churchill was saying: &#8220;I have always said that if Britain were defeated in war, I hoped that we should find a Hitler to lead us back to our rightful place among nations.&#8221; (Speech of November 6, 1938) We were fighting against fascism when the American press was filled with praise for Mussolini because &#8220;the trains were running on time.&#8221; And we were opposed to Japanese imperialism when American business interests were shipping scrap iron to Japan (now landing in American bodies) and when that policy was well-nigh universally approved.</p>

<p>We have, it is true, a different analysis of the cause of fascism and a different proposal as to how to destroy it than does Mr. Markham but that hardly warrants his saying that we are &#8220;neutral.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nor is it true to say that <strong>Labor Action</strong> &#8220; is devoted to denouncing everything everywhere and always.&#8221; There are plenty of things we are FOR; your reporter could have discovered them very easily had he approached his assignment with a modicum of fairness.</p>

<p>He would have discovered that we have a positive program in defense of labor&#8217;s rights, a positive program on how to destroy fascism, a positive program on taxation, a positive program in respect to racial discrimination But to show that he would have had to do more than quote one sentence out of context.</p>

<p>But your reporter was more interested in wisecracks &#8211; and slanders.</p>

<p>He was more interested in making such utterly lying and vile statements &#8211; more fit for <strong>Der Deutsche Beobachter</strong> than for the <strong>Christian Science Monitor</strong> &#8211; as his statements about the <strong>Militant</strong> and the <strong>Socialist Call</strong>, whose anti-fascist integrity we defend despite our political disagreements with them. It is a slander to say that the <strong>Call</strong> tries to persuade anyone &#8220;that the better course for Americans now is to accept the teachings of pro-Nazi Americans and do nothing.&#8221; Or that one gets &#8220;exactly the same impression, from a file of the <strong>Call</strong> that he does from a file of any Nazi periodical published anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Joseph Goebbels were Mr. Markham&#8217;s employer, he would pat Mr. Markham&#8217;s cheek for this kind of slanderous amalgam, but what does the <strong>Christian Science Monitor</strong> have to say?</p>

<p>I request immediate publication of the above letter in order to reply to the utterly false assertions made in Mr. Markham&#8217;s article.</p>
