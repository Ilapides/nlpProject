<p class="fst">The 6th Annual Convention of the American Youth Congress ended this weekend with the question of its Stalinist control unchanged.</p>

<p>As in all previous Conventions of the AYC, the Young Communist League established decisive control by two methods: 1) electing large numbers of packed delegations from their paper &#8220;front&#8221; organizations who follow the &#8220;party line&#8221; on all crucial questions, and 2) by having their stooges in genuine youth organizations elected as delegates. In this manner, the Stalinists succeeded in giving the Congress a certain coloring of genuine youth representation, despite the numerous groups, such as Young Judea, which have withdrawn from the AYC.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Tunney Farce</h4>

<p>This pose as the genuine spokesmen of American youth was made considerably easier by red-baiting attacks of Gene Tunney and his youth stooge, Murray Plavner, which were eagerly seized upon by the press. Many of the non-Stalinist delegates at this Congress were brought under Stalinist influence because they correctly resented the red-baiting of Tunney&#8217;s boys. And the Stalinists cleverly utilized this fact by inviting Tunney to speak and then mocking his refusal.</p>

<p>They thus succeeded in partially obscuring the &#8216;fact&#8217; that they had steadily, since the organization of the AYC, acted in the most undemocratic manner towards delegates who opposed them from a progressive, anti-war point of view.</p>

<p>The decisive control established by the Stalinists can be clearly seen in the actions which the Congress took on the war question. The Convention held a year ago had taken the then Stalinist attitude on war: support of the capitalist democracies and endorsement of President Roosevelt&#8217;s &#8220;defense plans.&#8221; This, of course, was before the Hitler-Stalin pact. At this convention, the delegates swung sharply to the present Stalinist position: opposition to Roosevelt and the Allies, as a result of the Hitler-Stalin pact.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that whatever genuine anti-war spokesmen were at the convention were unable to gain the floor in order to expose the hypocrisy of the Stalinists, many non-Stalinist delegates voted for their resolutions because they believed them to be motivated by real anti-war sentiment.</p>

<p>Further evidence of Stalinist control was seen in the defeat of a resolution which directly labeled the Soviet Union a dictatorship.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>No Change in Line</h4>

<p>Considerable excitement was created when Mac Weiss, leader of the Young Communist League, made a speech urging, an American-Soviet alliance to defeat Hitlerism. This was interpreted as a possible &#8220;change in line&#8221; by the Stalinists on the part of many delegates. Actually however, it was merely a clever statement of the present line of the Stalinists. They have always been in favor of an American-Soviet alliance and they were now merely stating it in such a manner as to try to show that they were not really pro-Hitler as charged.</p>

<p>The fervid anti-Hitler sentiment of the American people which was mirrored at the convention forced Weiss to toss in a few attacks to try to whitewash the present essentially pro-Hitler position of the Stalinists. On the issue of conscription the Congress took a wishy-washy position. It voted against military conscription, but prefaced the resolution by declaring itself ready to fight &#8220;for the defense of American democracy.&#8221; In view of the fact that any war America may conduct will be described as a war for democracy, the resolution is open to numerous pro-war interpretations.</p>

<p>There was only a small pro-Allied and pro-Roosevelt bloc at the Congress. This was led by Joe Lash, former Secretary of the American Student Union and formerly a Stalinist stooge in the student movement. Lash has shifted to the role of unofficial spokesman for the war administration of Washington inside the youth movement.</p>

<p>Despite the reactionary use to which it was put by the Stalinists, there was considerable genuine anti-war sentiment among the unaffiliated delegates. The organization as a whole, however, remains firmly in the hands of the Young Communist League which will attempt to use it as a front for its reactionary position.</p>
