<p class="fst">To the Editor:</p>

<p class="fst">Two issues ago in <strong>Labor Action</strong> I had an <a href="../03/hook.html" target="new">article on Sidney Hook</a> and his statements about the Catholic Church. Were I to write about that matter again, I would refrain from two errors of interpretation and taste which I made. I did not make clear that what Hook was writing about was the problem of <em>political</em> relationships to the church, and thus might have given the impression that he proposed some sort of intellectual alliance with Catholicism. That is not true. Secondly, I wrote with unnecessary nastiness of tone, a manner of writing that is always to be deplored. Precisely because I think the political point of the article was essentially valid do I regret these two lapses.</p>
