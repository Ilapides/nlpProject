byKarl Kautsky<br/>
with an introduction by Sidney Hook<br/>
<em>The Rand School Press, 142 pages, $2.00</em></p>

<p class="fst">Here is the swan song of Social-Democracy, sung by its most
powerful voice, Karl Kautsky. Written in the 1930&#8217;s, these essays
comprise the last grandiose attempt to present Social-Democracy as a
political theory consistent with the Marxian system. And surely
Social-Democracy could have found no more competent spokesman!
Kautsky writes with the broad historical sweep and assurance which is
given only to the most competent of theoreticians and historians; his
logic is keen, his argument close. Yet, once tribute has been paid to
Kautsky&#8217;s competence, one must pass to the content of his work. And
how sad that is! Not all of Kautsky&#8217;s skill and authority can give
sheen to the tarnished goods that are found each week in <strong>The New
Leader</strong>: the same formal preachment of &#8220;democracy&#8221; to which no
content other than constant support of capitalist institutions is
ever given; the same hypocrisy with regard to political means:
Quaker-like indignation at the idea that the defense of socialism may
require extra-parliamentary means coupled with vicariously
bloodthirsty support of imperialist war;, the same uncanny ability to
embroider the most paltry political practices with the most stirring
humanitarian rhetoric. It would be absurd to attempt a review here of
the historic quarrel between Marxism and Kautsky&#8217;s revision of it;
a few points only, of special pertinence, should be made:</p>

<p class="fst">1) It is remarkable how an idea can gain currency, despite its
invalidity and inaccuracy, if it is repeated often enough. Kautsky
tries, with much erudition, to discover the roots of the Bolshevik
ideology in the theories of the extremist leader of the French
Revolution, Babeuf, and later the 19th century putschist, Blanqui.
The theories of Babeuf &#8211; he notes correctly enough &#8211; were
developed at a time when the working class was still incipient in
formation and when the extreme left in the chain of French
revolutions found itself in the tragic and anomalous position of
trying to anticipate history. Lenin, continues Kautsky, developed a
similar theory with regard to the also backward Russian proletariat;
he made the same error as Babeuf and Blanqui, he tried to substitute
the action of a small conspiratorial group for the movement of a
social class.</p>

<p>But it needs only to be pointed out, in refutation, that Lenin&#8217;s
theory was an internationalist one, based on an assessment of the
Russian working class in relation to the world proletariat. He took
the historical &#8220;gamble&#8221; &#8211; and who dares call himself a
revolutionist or a Marxist if unwilling to take such &#8220;gambles&#8221;? &#8211;
of seizing upon an extraordinarily favorable conjunction to lead the
Russian workers to power in the hope that the workers of the advanced
West would soon come to the rescue. That they did not is another
matter-a matter, incidentally, for which Kautsky carried a heavy
share of responsibility. The point is that even if, by some
historical freak the little groups of Babeuf or Blanqui had been able
to seize power in France, they could not have counted on the aid from
elsewhere for which Lenin was later to hope. For 19th century France
had the most advanced revolutionary masses of its time, not the most
backward population of Europe, as did 20th century Russia. Rather
than relying on small conspiratorial groups, Lenin was able to gain
the support of masses of workers, unlike Babeuf and Blanqui, who
neither desired to <em>nor were able to</em> appeal to masses.
Historical analogy is a powerful weapon, but it is two-edged.</p>

<p class="fst">2) Why did the Social-Democracy fail? Why, if it, unlike the
&#8220;Bolshevik conspirators,&#8221; represented the true union of socialism
and democracy, did it not succeed in wresting power from capitalism
and forestalling the contemporary nightmare? Here is Kautsky&#8217;s answer:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Everything of a truly progressive nature which the
Bolsheviks sought at that time to realize was also part of the
program of the other Socialist Parties and <em>would have been</em>
carried out by them, for the people had empowered them to do so.&#8221;
(My emphasis &#8211; <em>I.H.</em>)</p>

<p class="fst">Has there ever been a historical apology at once so tragic and
comic? Before the Bolsheviks took power, there was a Menshevik-SR
government in Russia, that is, one composed of Kautsky&#8217;s friends.
What prevented it from beginning to put into effect &#8220;everything of
a truly progressive nature which the Bolsheviks sought&#8221;? And what
prevented the German Social-Democrats? If &#8220;everything of a truly
progressive nature which the Bolsheviks sought&#8221; had <em>really</em>
been carried out by the Mensheviks, then Lenin would have been
politically disarmed; <em>if</em> ...<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sees State Capitalism in 1919</h4>

<p class="fst">3) Kautsky was one of the first in the labor movement to
characterize Russia as a society of state capitalism. Let it be
noted, however, before there is even a handclap of misplaced applause
for this seeming prescience, that Kautsky applied this label
indiscriminately to the varied and rich development of
post-revolutionary Russia, all the way from 1919 to the period of
Stalin&#8217;s consolidation of power in the middle thirties. Such a
lumping of infinitely different social phenomena under one generic
heading is only a means of escaping the historian&#8217;s responsibility
rather than facing it. One cannot take seriously any sociological
category which is supposed to encompass within its discreet fold both
Lenin&#8217;s revolutionary and Stalin&#8217;s counter-revolutionary Russia.
Kautsky&#8217;s use of the label, state capitalism, as a means of
describing the new, unique phenomenon of a totally statified economy
in which no workers control exists, is merely another instance of the
common fallacy of believing that an unfamiliar phenomenon is made
less so if it is given a familiar label. But if calling Stalinist
Russia state capitalism attenuates the shock of novelty in the heart
of the observer, it does not in the slightest penetrate into the
reality of this new social formation.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">It may be asked how a man of Kautsky&#8217;s stature, who in the early
part of the century was one of the two or three greatest Marxists,
could have degenerated to the point where, in the thirties, he pinned
his hope for the future of humanity on ... the League of Nations?
Answers to such questions, when confined to individual cases, must
skirt the unsteady grounds of personal psychology. In Kautsky&#8217;s
case, it has been suggested, that his life of comfort as a
theoretician of the powerful Social-Democracy &#8211; a life of secluded
scholarship (for which, let us wryly admit, almost every
revolutionary theoretician yearns) &#8211; gradually acclimated him to an
acceptance of the <em>status quo</em>. Revolutions may be hatched in
libraries; they are not led there. But whatever the explanation for
Kautsky&#8217;s personal development, it cannot be gainsaid that there is
an element of genuine tragedy in the decline of this once titanic Marxist.</p>

<p>Tragedy, however, is hardly the appropriate word for the author of
the introduction to this book, Sidney Hook, who was also once a
Marxist &#8211; and a talented one at that. Hook, who has come a long way
since he wrote <strong>Towards the Understanding of Karl Marx</strong>,
contributes an introduction of unrestrained praise for Kautsky to
which he merely appends a critical phrase in polite <em>sotto voce</em>.
Hook writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... although Kautsky is perfectly justified in
defending the Social-Democratic attempt to preserve the <em>democratic</em>
heritage of the Weimar Republic, he minimizes the consequences of its
attempt to preserve the <em>capitalistic</em> economic structure of the
the Republic as well.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Notice that deliciously delicate phrase: &#8220;minimizes the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>For Sidney Hook is hardly the person to become raucous about a
mere detail such as the preservation of the &#8220;capitalistic economic structure.&#8221;</p>
