<p class="fst"><b>The Fate of Writing in America</b><br/>
by James T. Farrell<br/>
<i>New Directions, New York 1946: 25 cents</i></p>

<p class="fst">In this pamphlet, the novelist James T. Farrell has examined the
tendencies towards concentration and centralization in the publishing
business, the counter-tendencies which make for a relatively small
scale and free industry, and the position of the serious writer in
relation to these developments.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The war boom,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;demonstrated positively
that mass production and distribution in books are both feasible and
highly profitable. These developments are irreversible. Their
structural consequences are revealed in the tendency towards
combinations and centralization. Inevitably every phase of book
business will become more concentrated than in the past. This
concentration will increase the difficulties of operation for small
and independent publishers, and it will probably have the effect of
requiring a higher initial investment from any newcomers into the field.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This economic tendency, reflecting the general tendency of
capitalist economy, is traced by Farrell in certain recent
developments in the publishing field: the growth of gigantic reprint
houses which produce books cheaply and on such a mass scale as to
require a high degree of standardization and certainty of huge sales;
the combination of a number of smaller houses in to large concerns;
the increasing dependence of publishing on Hollywood in a hoped-for
sales of books. for movie production.</p>

<p>But simultaneously Farrell indicates where, in his opinion, the
tendency towards centralization and standardization has not yet
reached and probably will soon not reach the extreme to which it has
gone in Hollywood. The book medium. has a tradition, a heritage of
greatness as the major cultural conveyer of our civilization that is
totally foreign to the movies and which gives the publishing business
a certain kinship to cultural values. Limited though it may be by
commercial considerations, such a kinship is still largely foreign to
Hollywood. The capital investment required to publish a book is far
less than that required to produce a movie and the publisher need not
therefore concern himself so greatly with standardized tastes,
pressure groups and &#8220;public opinion&#8221; as does the movie producer.
And finally, the individual writer in his dealings with the
publishers can, no matter what his personal discomfort, strive to
maintain his integrity, to avoid the temptations of fat contracts
which come from writing popular trash.</p>

<p>It is on this last note that Farrell ends his pamphlet: a call to
his fellow writers to maintain their independence from commercial
subservience. He is aware that in order to live writers must deal
with commercial considerations; they cannot loftily disdain the
social conditions in which they function. But they must nevertheless
say &#8220;with scorn in their voices, that they will not be hacks.&#8221;
The writer, says Farrell, is &#8220;an active and not a passive agent in
this situation&#8221;, and it is his responsibility firmly to refrain
from the tawdry temptations which a decadent society may occasionally
offer him-when it doesn&#8217;t disdain him altogether.</p>

<p>In this brief notice, the issues raised by this pamphlet cannot be
discussed. But it should be said that Farrell&#8217;s article will be
found both interesting and provocative to anyone who is concerned
with the problem of culture in capitalist America.</p>
