<p class="fst"><strong>The Withering Away of the State</strong><br/>
by Solomon Bloom<br/>
<em>A pamphlet, reprinted from the <strong>Journal of the History of Ideas</strong>, Winter, 1946</em></p>

<p class="fst">In this essay, Professor Bloom, who has acquired something of a
reputation as a critic of Marxism, attempts to demonstrate what he
considers the varying conceptions on the theory of the state held by
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. His thesis is that Engels made
greater concessions to the &#8220;anarchist conception of the state&#8221;
than did Marx; and that Marx, on the contrary, really was &#8220;closer
to the liberal tradition than to formal anarchism.&#8221; Bloom reaches
these conclusions by means of an examination of one of the crucial
conceptions in the Marxian system: the &#8220;withering away&#8221; of the
state during the epoch of communism and its replacement by a
classless &#8220;administration of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bloom begins by describing the traditional version of the Marxian
conception. He quotes Marx:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The abolition of the state has meaning only for
Communists, as the necessary result of the abolition of classes with
which the necessity of the organized force of one class for the
suppression of other classes falls away of itself.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">According to the commonly accepted Marxian schema, capitalism is
overthrown by the working class, which replaces it by a
revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat which, in turn, serves
as the transition to a classless communist society. Once this
classless society is approached, the state &#8211; <em>by definition</em>
having as its purpose class exploitation and hence by now without
function &#8211; commences to &#8220;wither away.&#8221;</p>

<p>This idea received its classical formulation in a letter which
Engels wrote to August Bebel:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;As soon as there is no longer a class of society to be
held in subjection; as soon as, along with class domination and the
struggle for individual existence based on the former anarchy of
production, the collisions and excesses arising from them have also
been removed, there is nothing more to repress which would make a
special repressive force, a state, necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">What this new &#8220;administration of things&#8221; is, as opposed to a
class state, writes Bloom, is &#8220;nowhere in Marx or in Engels ...
discussed directly and comprehensively. We may get some answers,
however, from Engels&#8217; accounts of the emergence of the state, for
he gave at least two accounts. One was that after society had become
split into classes their conflicts became so severe that they
endangered the existence of society itself. In order to save it by
allaying the conflict, a public power became necessary: this power
was the first state ...&#8221;</p>

<p>The other explanation was that the state existed <em>before</em> the
division of society into classes. As Engels wrote in <strong>Anti-D&#252;hring</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8221;The state, which primitive communities had at first
developed only for the purpose of safeguarding their <em>common
interests</em> ... and providing protection against external enemies.&#8221;
(My emphasis &#8211; <em>I.H.</em>)</p>

<p class="fst">Bloom then proceeds to examine the much more crucial question of
Marx&#8217;s conception of the <em>future</em> &#8220;withering away of the
state.&#8221; He quotes from Marx&#8217;s major work on this subject, <strong>The
Critique of the Gotha Program</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The question then arises: what changes will the state
organization undergo in a communist society? In other words, what
social functions still remain there which are analogous to the
present functions of the state?</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Between the capitalist and the communist society lies
the period of revolutionary transformation of the one into the other.
To this there corresponds also a political transition period, whose
state can be nothing else than the <em>revolutionary dictatorship
of the proletariat</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The (Gotha) Program deals neither with the latter nor
with the future state organization of the communist society.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">It is on this latter phrase (&#8220;the future state organization of
the communist society&#8221;) that Bloom bases most of his contention
that Marx believed that even under communism the state would continue
to exist. Accordingly, he continues, Marx used the term &#8220;state&#8221;
in two different ways: &#8220;In class society, the state is the tool of
the ruling class .... in the absence of classes, the state is
properly the responsible agent of society.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bloom&#8217;s conclusion js that &#8220;the weight of the evidence is
rather against an anarchist interpretation of the doctrine of Marx&#8221;
since Marx &#8220;insisted on the need of centralization and authority
and indeed implied the possibility of a state organization&#8221; under communism.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">To this reviewer, Bloom&#8217;s essay seems an ingenious but
unsuccessful attempt to construct, by the method of quotation, the
thesis that Marx&#8217;s theory of the state does not have the ultimate
libertarian perspective usually attributed to it.</p>

<p>The aid which such a construction would give to the current
anti-Marxian offensive is not difficult to see. A brief refutation
involves the following points:</p>

<p class="fst">1) The argument from Engels&#8217; statements about primitive society
seems irrelevant to the question of the <em>future</em> &#8220;withering
away of the state.&#8221; Its use involves an unwarranted identification
of &#8220;primitive communism&#8221; with the future communism based on a
high productive level. For if a state did exist in a classless
&#8220;primitive communism,&#8221; it had as its purpose the mere mutual
protection of the tribe against enemy groups and functioned on a
social level lower than that of even simple slavery. What relevance
such hypothetical &#8220;states&#8221; in the hypothetical society known as
&#8220;primitive&#8221; communism have to the problem of the existence or
non-existence of the state in a highly advanced communist society is
not clear to this reviewer.</p>

<p class="fst">2) The crux of the question, however, is the by-now famous
quotation from the <strong>Gotha Critique</strong>. Bloom is not the first to
have offered this quotation as being contradictory to everything else
that Marx and Engels wrote. In a footnote, Bloom writes that Lenin
too was perplexed for a time by this quotation and that he, Bloom,
finds Lenin&#8217;s analysis of this matter unconvincing. Bloom does not,
unfortunately, offer any reasons for finding Lenin&#8217;s analysis of
this matter unconvincing, but this reviewer believes that Lenin&#8217;s
remarks on the matter are, when considered within the framework of
the entire Marxian system, thoroughly satisfactory. Lenin attempts to
make clear what Marx meant when writing about the &#8220;future state
organization of communist society&#8221; by quoting from a further
section of <strong>The Critique</strong> in which Marx distinguished between
<em>two stages</em> of communist society (which Lenin was subsequently
to characterize as socialism and communism.) In the first stage,
writes Marx:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;What we have to deal with here is a communist society,
not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary,
as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus, in every
respect, economically, morally and intellectually, still stamped with
the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges ...
these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist
society.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And Marx continues:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In a higher phase of communist society ... the narrow
horizon of bourgeois right (can) be fully left behind and society
(can) inscribe on its banners: from each according to his abilities,
to each according to his needs.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Since, says Lenin in his fascinating notebook on <strong>The Critique</strong>,
&#8220;semi-bourgeois rights would still exist&#8221; in the first stage of
communism, so too &#8220;the semi-bourgeois state&#8221; has still not fully
disappeared. And in <strong>State and Revolution</strong>, Lenin repeats the
same idea in slightly different language: &#8220;Consequently, not only
bourgeois right but even the bourgeois state for a certain time
remains under communism, without the bourgeoisie.&#8221; In other words,
Marx&#8217;s reference to the &#8220;future state organization of the
communist society&#8221; upon which Bloom rests his entire, case is
merely a reference to the process of the &#8220;withering away&#8221; of the
state which begins, according to the Marxian conception,
approximately when the dictatorship of the proletariat slides into
the &#8220;first phase of communism.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">3) Now all this may seem rather casuistic and Talmudic. But it is
necessary to refute attempts, such as those of Bloom, to give Marx an
authoritarian emphasis which does not really apply. Once that is
done, we can proceed to the interesting question: just what would the
actual development of this &#8220;withering away of the state&#8221; entail?
Did Lenin foresee a situation in which the state had already withered
away by the time the dictatorship of the proletariat slides into
socialism (or, as he calls it, &#8220;the first phase of communism&#8221;) or
a situation in which the &#8220;withering away of the state&#8221; <em>begins</em>
with socialism? In the latter case, Marx&#8217;s phrase about &#8220;the
state organization&#8221; of communist society is perfectly
comprehensible.</p>

<p>The basic trouble with an approach such as that of Bloom is that
it views the whole matter most mechanically, as if it were a mere
question of constructing conceptualized categories which had Chinese
walls between them. I doubt very much if the future workers&#8217; state
will proclaim, say, on January 1, that &#8220;as of today&#8221; it is no
longer a workers&#8217; state but rather the &#8220;first phase of communist
society.&#8221; The categories of distinction set up by Marx and
developed by Lenin are categories whose purposes are largely useful
in terms of goals and processes of development toward which to
strive; and aids to future historians who will be able to check back
on the actual development of a free society to compare it with the
Marxian forecast.</p>

<p>Bloom&#8217;s attempt to blow up an entire theoretical structure by
pitting quotation against quotation may earn him a pat on the head in
the artery-hardened circles of American bourgeois sociology, but
cannot be taken very seriously by Marxists.</p>
