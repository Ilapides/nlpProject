<p class="fst">The analysis of the recent strike in the Goodyear Tire and Rubber
 plants in Akron centers about three points: the role and temper of
 the strikers themselves; the role of union officials and in
 particular John L. Lewis&rsquo;s Committee for Industrial
 Organization; and that of the working-class political parties and
 groups.</P>
<P>In tackling the Goodyear Company, the strikers were pitting their
 forces against the biggest of the tire and rubber companies, which
 had one of the oldest, and until the recent strike most &ldquo;successful&rdquo;
 company unions, and which had very important connections with big
 corporations in steel and other industries. Thus Tom Girdler of
 Republic Steel is on the Goodyear board of directors and offered his
 strike-breaking troops to Goodyear. On the other hand; the intensely
 competitive situation existing in the industry was favorable to the
 strikers in that Goodyear could not afford to lose business to other
 companies. From another standpoint it was this very competitive
 situation leading the companies to devise means to cut labor costs
 which brought the combination of wage-cuts, speed-up, increased hours
 and lay-offs by the Goodyear Company against which the workers
 revolted.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Vigilantes Crushed</H4>
<p class="fst">The militancy and solidarity of the Goodyear strikers marked the
 high point in the class struggle for 1936 and in some respects for
 the entire recent period in American labor history. Before the
 Goodyear men were assured of support even from their own local and
 international union, they closed down the Goodyear plant and
 militantly and successfully defied an injunction. Immediately
 thereafter the workers in the Firestone and Goodrich plants and in
 most of the other industries in Akron as well as the Project Workers
 Unions were mobilized. They were set to pour out of the plants <I>en
 masse</I> and institute a general strike at any attempt by any agency
 to break the Goodyear picket line by force. When in one of the last
 weeks of the strike, the company inspired the organization of a
 vigilante organization on a large scale and publicly appealed for
 violence against the strikers&rsquo; and their leaders, six thousand
 strikers gathered on the picket line openly armed with clubs and
 other weapons and challenged the vigilantes to do their worst. After
 all their loud talk, the so-called &ldquo;forces of law and order&rdquo;
 decided that their aim was simply to rally public opinion for an
 early settlement of the strike. The strikers maintained their ranks
 and their spirit to the very end. Whatever was gained, in the strike,
 and that was considerable, was gained because of this.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Role of C.I.O.</H4>
<p class="fst">The role of Lewis&rsquo;s Committee for Industrial Organization in
 the Akron strike, as in other situations in this period, was not a
 simple one and no simple and completely final estimate of it is
 possible. There is, on the one hand, no question that the C.I.O. made
 contributions to the strike. The moral influence of its support
 counted for a good deal. The trained organizers sent into Akron by
 the Committee had an important share in building up the excellent
 strike organization. The fact of C.I.O. endorsement doubtless helped
 in getting financial support from union bodies throughout the
 country, though that given by the C.I.O. and the unions affiliated
 with it was utterly insignificant.</P>
<P>There is, however, much to be said on the other side. The C.I.O.
 came out in support of the strike only after the workers had shut
 down the plant. It made no effort, although repeatedly urged to do so
 by militant strikers, to extend the strike to Goodyear plants in
 other cities, an elementary step. By speech and action C.I.O.
 representatives sought to tone down rather than capitalize to the
 utmost upon the militancy of the Akron workers. They agreed to permit
 tires to be moved out of the plant though the strikers were against
 it and there is every reason to believe that railroad men would not
 have moved any freight cars if a picket line had been maintained
 across the tracks.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>An Agency for Roosevelt</H4>
<p class="fst">That the C.I.O. is an agency for rallying Roosevelt support from
 among the unions and the workers generally has been openly
 demonstrated since the close of the Akron strike with the
 organization by Lewis, Hillman, Berry etc., of the Non-Partisan Labor
 Committee. The Akron strike furnished an illustration of the
 equivocal role to which this leads in strike situations, It is
 generally understood that the &ldquo;influence&rdquo; of Lewis and
 other trade unionists with Roosevelt had an important bearing on
 keeping the militia out of Akron &ndash; in an election year in a key
 state. But this means, for one thing, that in &ldquo;gratitude&rdquo;
 votes are to be corralled for Roosevelt and for another thing that
 the strikers must be restrained so that the politicians may plausibly
 contend that there is really no need for calling out the militia.
 Obviously, too, it is fantastic to suppose that labor leaders who
 base themselves upon Roosevelt can possibly push employers in the
 basic industries to a settlement that costs them anything. And this
 point is of crucial importance in considering the strike settlements
 which the C.I.O. will support or be &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to make in
 situations like Akron.</P>
<H4>The McGrady Arbitration</H4>
<p class="fst">Now the C.I.O. was prepared to accept the McGrady arbitration
 proposed at the beginning of the strike. The effect of accepting it
 would unquestionably have been a betrayal of the strike. The role of-
 the C.I.O. representatives in the March 14 &ldquo;settlement&rdquo;
 which was rejected is not wholly clear. That is not the case with
 regard to the March 21 terms, the acceptance of which brought the
 strike to an end.</P>
<P>Admittedly these terms were an improvement on those of the
 previous week. Admittedly also they did not offer the strikers even
 that minimum (of assurance, for example, that Goodyear would no
 longer finance the company union, nor recognize its representatives)
 which they had laid down in a compromise proposal, from which already
 certain important demands had been eliminated, the previous week. It
 is also a matter of public record that the C.I.O. representatives
 suddenly launched the most vigorous, even feverish, public activity
 in order to get the strikers to vote for the acceptance of these
 terms and so wind up the strike. If the C.I.O. opposed acceptance of
 the March 14 terms, it has to explain what induced it to make such
 frantic efforts to put over only slightly improved terms a week
 later. There is not the slightest indication of any important change
 during that interval either in the general objective situation or in
 the temper of the strikers. In the effort to put over the March 21
 terms the C.I.O. representatives who had themselves been the object
 of C. Nelson Sparks&rsquo;s &ldquo;red scare&rdquo; campaign during
 the week put on a &ldquo;red scare&rdquo; against the Workers Party,
 Communist Party, &ldquo;radicals&rdquo; generally and the present
 writer by name, stooping lower than A.F. of L. reactionaries have
 ever gone in similar situations in which I have been involved by
 saying to reporters that I must be acting for a strike-breaking
 agency which just wanted the strike prolonged so as to make money by
 cracking workers&rsquo; heads. It was in such an atmosphere of
 hysteria that the strikers voted to accept the March 21 terms and
 ended the strike, after the more militant elements among them had
 criticized the terms and indicated their preference for continuing
 the fight, but stated their readiness to accept loyally whatever
 decision might be taken by the majority.</P>
<P>Now in the first place any child can see that the terrific effort
 that was required, the barrage that had to be laid down in public and
 private, to put the settlement over disposes completely of the
 argument that either the general run of strikers or the more
 conscious, militant elements were tired or discouraged or for
 whatever reason wanted to get back to work on pretty much any
 terms.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>How the Agreement Carried</H4>
<p class="fst">Secondly, it disposes of the argument that the terms themselves
 were so clear and so desirable from the strikers&rsquo; point of view
 that any criticism or opposition could spring only from dense
 ignorance or actual treason to the union. The Rubber Workers
 officials and the C.I.O. were able to put them over only by taking a
 vote in an atmosphere of hysteria and without giving the strikers a
 minute for real study of the terms. Two large sheets of mimeographed
 material of a very complicated nature were handed them as they came
 to the meeting where the vote had to be taken, and this in spite of
 the fact that the strikers had been told two days before that they
 would be given several days to study the proposals.</P>
<P>One argument that has been presented by defenders of the C.I.O.
 role is that funds were low, money for feeding strikers was running
 out and the strikers were afraid to go on under these circumstances.
 One unwillingly admits the audacity of the cynicism that is implied
 here. It is generally agreed that the C.I.O. with some of the
 mightiest unions in the country attached to it gave a paltry few
 thousand dollars to the strike fund. Let us restrain any indignation
 which the situation might occasion, and simply observe that no group
 which thinks that the employers in the basic industries in this
 country can be licked on the basis of putting a few thousand dollars
 into a strike against Goodyear Tire and Rubber involving fifteen
 thousand workers can expect to be taken seriously.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Timidity of Local Leaders</H4>
<p class="fst">Still another argument used by the defenders of the C.I.O. role is
 that the local and national officials of the Rubber Workers Union
 were weak and timid, did not want a vigorous and large-scale
 struggle, would not ask for money which had virtually been put at
 their disposal. If they had only followed the wishes and the lead of
 the C.I.O. much more might have been won. It taxes our credulity to
 pretty near the breaking point to believe this. An organization with
 prestige and money offers a victory and a union to a group of new and
 ambitious union leaders on a silver platter, and the latter decline
 the gift!</P>
<P>But let us assume there is some basis for the argument, then what
 follows? That these weak-kneed leaders and their course must be
 backed up by the kind of red-baiting campaign Germer of the C.I.O.
 along with Burns of the Rubber Workers launched in the closing hours
 of the strike? That the &ldquo;heat&rdquo; must be turned on as was
 done, on the militants among the strikers to force them against their
 will to accept this situation? Obviously, if the job of organizing
 the basic industries is to be taken seriously, then in such a crisis
 a (supposedly) genuine and competent leadership must find means of
 rallying the masses as against a false and incompetent leadership. We
 may surmise that John L. Lewis who still maintains arbitrary
 provisional presidencies under his own direct control in most of the
 soft coal districts of the U.M.W. is not likely to see eye to eye
 with the rank and file or insurgents as against officials in such
 situations. But that is another reason for concluding that he cannot
 be relied upon to see the job of organization in the basic industries
 through.</P>
<P>There is but one logical conclusion. Whether in so many words or
 not, Lewis&rsquo;s real master, i.e., Roosevelt and the interests and
 forces which he represents made it clear: &ldquo;This thing has gone
 far enough. Goodyear is giving all it will give without a regular
 fight. That we will not stand for. We will not hold back the militia
 any longer. Wind it up at any cost.&rdquo; And when it was wound up
 the rubber companies, Goodyear included, had the 36- to 40-hour week
 although only a month before a U.S. Department of Labor Committee had
 stated flatly that there was no excuse for the abandonment of the
 30-hour week. Furthermore, the companies laid the basis for recouping
 any losses and fattening profits by an increase in the price of their
 product!<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Parties in the Strike</H4>
<p class="fst">Finally a word about the role of political parties and groups. The
 local S.P. in Akron is small and attempted no distinctive role. The
 S.P. leaders in Akron were attached to the C.I.O. and played no
 independent part.</P>
<P>The Stalinists had some influence on some of the militant rank and
 filers. When the &ldquo;red-baiting&rdquo; started in the closing
 hours of the strike, the Stalinist representatives took to crawling
 on their bellies before the union bureaucrats in the abject manner
 which has become so familiar by now and so easy for them. They
 declared uncritically for the settlement terms before seeing them and
 laid any opposition that was being voiced at the door of &ldquo;crazy
 Trotskyists.&rdquo; This, despite the fact that one who reads between
 the lines of the <B>Daily Worker</B> articles following the strike,
 gets even there a confirmation of every criticism we have made in
 this article. In exchange the C.P. received an &ldquo;apology&rdquo;
 from Vice President Burns of the Rubber Workers Union for having
 included them among the critics of his course. To date they seem not
 yet to have gotten a similar public vote of confidence from John L.
 Lewis or even from Adolph Germer but perhaps these will also be
 obtained eventually &ndash; for a price!</P>
<P>The Workers Party group in Akron has for two years been in close
 touch with the militants among the rubber workers. Through them they
 played a highly creditable part in the strike in line with the
 policies sketched in this article. The Akron strike, like all the
 recent strike struggles, demonstrated the key position of a group of
 progressives and militants including conscious revolutionary
 elements. The better organization of these elements is a crying need.</P>
<P>To summarize: Militants must make every use that can be made of
 the C.I.O. They rightly support any specific correct measure for
 which the C.I.O. may stand, for example industrial as against craft
 unionism. At no time can they simply uncritically identify themselves
 with the C.I.O. or foster the illusion that the C.I.O. as such can be
 trusted to carry through the terrific struggles which we are bound to
 see in the basic industries.</P>
<P>The solidarity and militancy displayed by the Goodyear strikers
 and their fellow-workers in Akron achieved substantial results. They
 tied up the great Goodyear plants. They smashed an injunction. They
 made a farce out of the vigilante movement. They forced Goodyear to
 negotiate with a union committee. They won some concessions in the
 settlement. They laid the foundation of a union, having proved to
 themselves that they could stick together and fight. They are
 carrying their struggle forward now in the plants &ndash; well aware
 that the fight has not ended but has just begun in real earnest.</P>
