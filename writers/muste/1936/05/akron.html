<p class="fst">Several &ldquo;sit-down&rdquo; strikes have occurred recently in
 the Akron rubber plants including the Goodyear where a great strike
 came to an end only two months ago. Last Saturday thirty-one
 militants of Plant Two of Goodyear were suddenly rounded up on
 charges of rioting in connection with one of these &ldquo;sit-downs&rdquo;.
 What is behind these turbulent developments?</P>
<P>As readers of the <B>New Militant</B> will recall, the
 &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; which marked the end of the Goodyear strike
 was by no means fully satisfactory to the workers. For one thing, the
 demand that the Goodyear company union be abolished, or at least that
 the company definitely agree no longer to finance it, was not
 achieved. Thus the workers went back partly as union men, a minority
 as company union men. Now no situation where a real union and a
 company union exists side by side can possibly be a static one. The
 employer immediately resorts to direct or indirect methods to
 undermine the union. The union men, unless they are prepared to lose
 the ground which they have won in their strike struggle, must work to
 win over or eliminate non-union or anti-union workers. The fight is
 invariably transferred from the picket line to the plant. In this
 case the conflict is peculiarly sharp, because the men have
 maintained at top pitch the militancy which they displayed during the
 strike at Goodyear, the other big companies, and the employers in the
 basic industries generally are well aware that if the rubber union
 actually establishes itself, the movement in steel and automobiles
 will receive a tremendous impetus.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Conditions Still Bad</H4>
<p class="fst">If there was a particle of ground left for the assertion that the
 &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; of March 21st effected even a partial
 adjustment of basic problems, that particle is now removed. Even the
 capitalist press admits this. The <B>Cleveland Press, </B>for
 example, stated the other day: &ldquo;Impartial observers say that in
 reality conditions in Akron are as bad as ever. They point to the
 frequent sit-down strikes in recent weeks as showing dissatisfaction
 in the ranks of the workers. Thus the use of company union
 pace-setters for speed-up purposes continues. In at least one
 department recently an attempt was made to increase hours without
 first taking a vote as provided in the strike settlement. Attempts to
 lay off union men continue though in each instance the militancy of
 the workers has thwarted them. The general fear of excessive lay-offs
 when the slack season comes, induced by the abolition of the
 thirty-hour week by the companies and the failure to get it restored
 by the strike, continues to dominate the thinking of the men.</P>
<P>Since production in rubber is still at a high level and in view of
 the automobile production level seems likely to continue for some
 weeks, the highly provocative acts of the company against union men
 present on the surface a puzzle. The most likely explanation is this.
 Though the company probably desires uninterrupted production at the
 moment, it cannot afford to appear supine and weak in face of the
 aggressiveness of the union men who in a recent sit-down practically
 took entire control of one of the Goodyear plants. Such a show of
 weakness would be certain to lead the men to begin the general strike
 against the large rubber firms to gain the genuine recognition and
 other demands which they failed to get in the strike settlement. Such
 a strike may also come if the company&rsquo;s attitude is hard
 boiled. In fact provocative measures carted beyond a certain point
 would certainly precipitate a strike. Thus the company will try to
 pursue a middle course until the main drive for production is over
 and an inventory is piled up when it may institute a lockout or
 answer a strike with a complete shut down for a considerable period.</P>
<P>A shut-down in the fall might be regarded as injurious to the
 Roosevelt election campaign and the big industrialists are trying to
 push Roosevelt still further to the right by such measures. It must
 be borne in mind also that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision on the
 Guffey Case threatening also the National Labor Relations Board,
 etc., is an open invitation to employers to take the offensive
 against the unions.</P>
<P>In the present Akron situation, charged with dynamite as it is,
 timorous and reactionary union officials will seek to curb and
 repress the magnificent militancy of the workers. Nothing could be
 worse. In a hit or miss, undirected use of the &ldquo;sit-down&rdquo;
 there is danger. The company might provoke such demonstrations to
 rouse the public prejudice against the workers, etc. But the
 militancy which will not tolerate employer injustice and insolence
 must be organized &ndash; not repressed. To company wails that the
 workers are interfering with production, the union can answer that
 corporations which refuse to recognize unions and to set up machinery
 for prompt adjustment of grievances are inviting trouble and ought to
 get it, since the alternative is submission and slavery for the
 workers.</P>
<P>The problem will not be solved, however, by the kind of agreement
 between the union and the employer which apparently &ldquo;recognizes&rdquo;
 the union but actually &ldquo;recognizes&rdquo; the union officialdom
 as agents for carrying on class collaboration with the employers. Not
 outward forms but the content and essence count in the matter of
 union agreements.</P>
<P>The basic fear of the Akron workers is layoffs, i.e. insecurity.
 The basic demand of the union is for no layoffs, the restoration of
 the normal thirty-hour week and reduction of hours to an even lower
 point in the slack season. That will mean job security. And that will
 lay the basis for confidence among the workers on which militancy can
 be permanently sustained.</P>
<P>The workers of Akron look to the leadership of the Rubber Workers
 Union and of the C.I.O. to advance toward that goal. What is their
 answer?</P>
