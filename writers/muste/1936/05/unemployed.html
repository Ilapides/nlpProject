<p class="fst">The recent unification of all the leading unemployed organizations
 into the Workers Alliance of America marks a definite period in the
 evolution of the movement. It is important that the militant workers
 in the field should understand the road that has been travelled, the
 trend which now prevails, and the policy which they must themselves
 adopt for the coming period.</P>
<P>To date the unemployed organizations have accomplished a number of
 important results. Their pressure has helped to keep relief standards
 from being scrapped completely. They have established and asserted
 the right of the unemployed to organize. They have corrected
 innumerable grievances of individuals and families. They have
 contributed some notable pages to the history of labor struggles in
 the United States. They have worked out the tactics, first applied on
 a large scale, in the Toledo Auto-Lite strike, of active
 participation in strikes of employed workers to an extent known in no
 other country. Through their work in connection with concrete needs
 of the unemployed and their educational activities, they have to a
 remarkable degree prevented Fascist or near-Fascist outfits from
 making inroads into the unemployed masses.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>From &ldquo;Self-Help&rdquo; to Class Struggle</H4>
<p class="fst">In the early months of the crisis when under the influence of
 various kinds of liberals and academicians many of the unemployed
 organizations were of the &ldquo;barter&rdquo; and &ldquo;sell-help&rdquo;
 type, no results were obtained. A system of exchange among those who
 had nothing, still left them with nothing in the end. Conditions
 became worse and worse. It was when the unemployed began to &ldquo;raise
 hell,&rdquo; built organizations on a basis (conscious or
 unconscious) of class struggle that some results were obtained. Not
 the least important result was that the unemployed learned the power
 of organization, realized their own strength, developed a fighting
 psychology. When the unemployed marched on Washington or other
 centers in 1932 to 1935 they were usually met by police on the
 outskirts of the city and prevented from entering or else so treated
 within the city limits that serious disturbances ensued. The some six
 hundred delegates at the recent unity convention of the unemployed in
 Washington in which the Workers Alliance of America absorbed the
 former National Unemployment Councils, National Unemployed League and
 a number of lesser organizations, convened in the spacious and
 imposing auditorium of the U.S. Department of Labor and their
 sessions were much more sedate than those of last fall&rsquo;s A.F.
 of L. convention! Much about the evolution and the present position
 of the unemployed movement is revealed in this contrast.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The Most Urgent Problem</H4>
<p class="fst">The fusing of many organizations of relief recipients and project
 workers into a relatively stable national body at this date &ndash;
 seven years after the beginning of the Great Depression, and three
 years after the advent of the New Deal administration &ndash;
 confirms Harry Hopkins&rsquo; recent utterance that &ldquo;unemployment
 is still the most urgent problem before the nation&rdquo; and
 suggests that the President&rsquo;s statement in his Baltimore speech
 to the effect that &ldquo;no man who is sensitive to human values
 dares to accept the continued existence of a vast permanent army of
 unemployed&rdquo; is the expression of a pious wish.</P>
 <P>Yet the unemployed and their organizations are not the immediate
 and dramatic &ldquo;menace&rdquo; which they constituted a couple of
 years ago. Objective factors in the general economic and political
 situation play a part here. The upturn in business, such as it is,
 has eased the tension. Relief payments and project wages are
 pitifully inadequate. Harassed by the inadequacies of appropriations,
 administrators are constantly resorting to schemes to cut down
 payments to the workers. The threat of removal from the rolls hangs
 over the beads of tens of thousands. There remain plenty of
 grievances on which to build and hold together the unemployed
 unions.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Changed Situation</H4>
<p class="fst">Nevertheless, the situation is less desperate than in those days
 when prosperity was supposed to be just around the corner,
 unemployment a passing phenomenon, and the only source of relief
 either the overburdened private charities or bankrupt city, county
 and state treasuries. Then too the temper of the masses was more
 inflammable in those months when for the first time the ground was
 slipping out from under their feet, &ldquo;upstanding Americans&rdquo;
 were forced to undergo the humiliation of applying for relief, were
 evicted from homes they had built, etc., than it is now when they
 have become in greater or lesser degree adjusted to a new status and
 a lowered standard of living. Another factor in producing a more
 stable situation is the fact that the Roosevelt-Hopkins policy of
 recognizing the &ldquo;right&rdquo; of the unemployed to organize but
 insisting that they behave in a &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; manner, as
 against the Tory attitude of flatly denying the right to organize, is
 percolating all the way down into the heads of at least a large
 percentage of the local administrators and foremen.</P>
<P>Such conditions tend to develop an organization devoted mainly to
 &ldquo;collective bargaining&rdquo; between workers and management
 (in this ease local, state and federal authorities) and lobbying for
 legislation in the interest of the group, rather than to agitation
 and &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; objectives. The establishment of the
 enlarged Workers&rsquo; Alliance of America definitely marked the
 ascendancy of this trend in the unemployed movement. The W.A.A. and
 its units will perform the function of &ldquo;trade unions for the
 unemployed.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The chief leaders of the W.A.A., Socialist and Stalinist,
 consciously encourage conservative trends rather than resist the
 tendency to conservatism in the movement. There were interesting
 illustrations of this during the convention. They displayed the
 greatest anxiety that delegations to Congressmen and the W.P.A.
 offices should behave like gentlemen, though they were actually going
 without meals and beds, and the authorities politically insisted
 nothing could be done about it. Foremost among the speakers who
 addressed the convention were liberal representatives and senators
 such as Lundeen, Marcantonio, Amlie and Frazier, some of whom are
 sponsoring social insurance and relief bills, and a personal
 representative of Harry Hopkins who calmly informed the delegates he
 could do nothing for their hungry stomachs and was politely applauded
 at the conclusion of his remarks. The Lasser-Benjamin leadership
 should hung its head in shame, if it is capable of that emotion, for
 permitting tills insulting and degrading performance. Until recently
 no convention of unemployed would have submitted to it. It should
 never be permitted to happen again.</P>
<P>Secretary Frank Morrison of the A.F. of L. represented President
 Green, but there was no speaker from John L. Lewis&rsquo; Committee
 for Industrial Organization! It is true that Norman Thomas and Mother
 Bloor also spoke but, doubtless in line with more or less direct
 hints from the officers, they refrained from putting forward the
 Socialist or the Communist parties respectively. All the recognized
 leaders spoke for a Farmer-Labor party to include also liberals and
 progressives, and the incoming National Executive Board is instructed
 to &ldquo;explore the possibilities&rdquo; of forming such a party on
 a national scale in 1936.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Power in United Body</H4>
<p class="fst">The lowering of the temper of the unemployed organizations in
 recent months has been accompanied, significantly enough, by a
 considerable slump in membership. The W.A.A. grew stronger because of
 the accession of previously existing units, rather than the formation
 of new ones, and thus gained relatively to the Councils and the
 Leagues, but its strongest state organization, for example, the
 Illinois Workers&rsquo; Alliance, experienced the same decline in
 membership and activity as was manifested in most other
 organizations.</P>
<P>Setting up of a single national organization of unemployed in
 which Socialists, Trotskyists, Stalinists, etc., participate is in an
 important respect a progressive achievement. It will give
 considerable impetus to the organizing movement in the immediate
 future, though conflict among diverse political tendencies will not
 by any means be entirely eliminated. Until some substantial change
 occurs in the general economic and political situation, possibly
 after the election, the policy of the W.A.A. is likely to reflect the
 general line and temper of the unity convention. This will he the aim
 of the Stalinists under their present undisguised and unrestricted
 opportunism and social-patriotism.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Only Struggle Effective</H4>
<p class="fst">What this line means for the unemployed is already plain to
 everybody. A terrific drive to cut down appropriations in order to
 &ldquo;balance the budget&rdquo; is under way. Thousands are being
 dropped from projects. Except where vigorous fighting organizations
 exist, all kinds of devices for worsening conditions are resorted to.
 No amount of flirting with the Green-Woll outfit in the A.F. of L. or
 with liberal congressmen, no amount of gentlemanliness in dealing
 with the clever politicians of the Roosevelt machine, no amount of
 polite lobbying by unemployed who have no money to bring into the
 lobbies, no amount of &ldquo;resoluting&rdquo; about fine-sounding
 but fake Stalinist farmer-labor or people&rsquo;s parties, will
 change this situation.</P>
<P>Whatever the unemployed got in the past, they got because they had
 strong organizations which went on the war-path. Building or reviving
 such organizations and carrying them into action is the job of
 revolutionists and militants today. A constant struggle with the
 state, with governmental agencies, is involved in the very nature of
 the unemployed situation and of any unemployed movement worthy of the
 name.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Link with Union Militants Needed</H4>
<p class="fst">It follows, also, that the unemployed organizations cannot gain by
 being drawn down to the low level of militancy in many of the unions.
 On the contrary, the working class movement as a whole can gain only
 if the unemployed help to heighten the militancy of the unions.
 Consequently, the tie-up which the unemployed must seek is with the
 industrial as against the craft-unionists in the A.F. of L. who have
 never evinced the slightest interest in the unemployed masses; and
 basically the tie-up must be not with bureaucrats at the top but with
 the militant-progressive forces in the unions &ndash; a tie forged
 and constantly made stronger in the daily struggles of employed and
 unemployed alike.</P>
<P>Since it is impossible in an unemployed organization to establish
 a very strict centralized control from the center, nothing prevents
 the fighting spirits in city, county, state organizations from
 getting busy at once with building along these lines; with invading
 such reactionary strongholds as Tampa, Florida; with support of
 militant strikes as the Project Workers Union in Akron stood ready to
 give the Goodyear workers recently; with large-scale local and state
 demonstrations. Thus will the W.A.A. be made into an important
 progressive force in the class-struggle in this country.</P>
