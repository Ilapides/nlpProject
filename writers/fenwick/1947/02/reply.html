<p class="fst">Dear Sir:</p>

<p class="fst">In the January 20 issue of <strong>Labor Action</strong>, James Fenwick, in his article, <em>Taking Off, Mr. Bolste?</em> refers to the wage cuts instituted by Omar Bradley in the on-the-job training program. I would like to know how the on-the-job training program caused wage cuts.</p>

<p class="fst">The article in question did not make the point that the on-the-job-training program caused wage cuts. It stated that General Bradley &ldquo;initiated the wage cuts in the on-the-job training program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Bradley who last year, utilizing the excuse that some employers were chiseling on the program by &ldquo;training&rdquo; executives for their posts at fancy figures like $700 a month, proposed that subsistence grants not be given beyond a total income of $175 per month for single men and $200 per month for married men. The proposal was incorporated in Senate Bill 2477 and passed by Congress. This meant a wage cut for a considerable, number of veterans who were earning more than these figures. This is what was referred to in the article.</p>

<p>The program itself, however, did induce unscrupulous employers to institute wage cuts, as the following story from <strong>Newsweek</strong> reveals:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;A veteran working as a garage mechanic in a small Southern town was getting $35 a week. When the garage offered to train him as a foreman, he accepted. They promptly cut his pay to $23 a week, explaining that his subsistence allowance would more than make up the difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">This action by Bradley was roundly condemned as late as a few weeks ago by the UAW Veterans&rsquo; Conference which met in Washington.</p>

<p>OK, L.J.?</p>
