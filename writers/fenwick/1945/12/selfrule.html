Many times it even stoops to telling the truth.</p><p><em>And the current truth is that while millions of soldiers and sailors in all the God-forsaken corners of the globe are sweating out redeployment, allegedly because of the lack of shipping space, scores of American-made ships are transporting the troops and materiel being used in the horrible massacre of the native populations of China, Indonesia and Indo-China.</em></p><p>The case is simple: The colonial peoples want the right to govern themselves. They want this right so that they can free themselves from the exploitation which condemns them to a life little better than that of the beasts of the fields.<br />&#160;</p><h4 class="western">U.S. Replaces Nazis</h4><p class="fst"><em>But imperialist France, Holland, Britain and the United States want control of these areas for economy, political and military reasons of their own. France and Holland, Which themselves know what it means to suffer under the yoke of a foreign oppressor, came out of the war so economically weak, however, that they can no longer even be simple and effective tyrants and murderers. The job had to be taken over by powerful United States imperialism.</em></p><p>That the United States foreign policy thereby becomes almost indistinguishable from the policy of Nazi Germany should come as a surprise only to those who believe that the war was fought for paper ideals like &#8220;democracy&#8221; rather than because of the capitalist greed for profits.</p><p>For the American soldier and sailor the present situation is a clear proof of the old socialist truth that the interests of workers all over the world are identical.</p><p class="c"><strong>Withdraw the troops, ships and arms being used against the colonial peoples in their struggle for independence!</strong></p><p class="c"><strong>Bring the American soldiers and sailors home!</strong></p><p class="link">&#160;<br /><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" width="100%" /><p class="linkback"><a href="../../index.html">Fenwick Archive</a>&#160;&#160; | &#160;&#160;<a href="../../../index.html">Trotskyist Writers Index</a>&#160;&#160; | &#160;&#160;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/index.htm">ETOL Main Page</a></p><p class="updat">Last updated: 26 January 2018</p></body>
