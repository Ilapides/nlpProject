<h4>France</h4>

<p class="fst">The International Communist Party, the French section of the Fourth International, recently opened a campaign for the establishment of a fund of one million francs (about $8,400 at the new rate of exchange).</p>

<p>The fund will have a twofold purpose: (1) to conduct a membership drive to extend the influence already revealed by the party in recent elections and in the acquisition of old-time members of the French Stalinist party who recently joined the French Trotskyist movement, and (2) to prepare for the election of several Trotskyists to the Constituent Assembly, the elections for which are scheduled to be held in five months.</p>

<p>The call for the campaign concludes with a demand for the utmost efforts from all so that &ldquo;after so many years the voice of communism will once more ring from the tribune of bourgeois parliament.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>India</h4>

<p class="fst">The <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, organ of the Revolutionary Communist Party, British section of the Fourth International, recently revealed that our Indian comrades, despite their having to work in illegality, and despite the imprisonment of leading comrades, continue their revolutionary work.</p>

<p><strong>Permanent Revolution</strong>, the theoretical organ of the Indian comrades continues to appear. Other publications include the following: A 200-page book by K. Tilak titled, <strong>From the First to the Fourth International</strong>, a brief history of the international working class movement; a hundred page pamphlet by C.R. Govindan, <strong>The First Round of the European Socialist Revolution</strong>, a study of recent developments in Europe; and an agitational pamphlet entitled, <strong>For an Anti-Imperialist Left Front</strong>.</p>

<p>In the last named pamphlet our Indian comrades call upon all anti-imperialist organizations for a united front on the following basis:</p>

<ul>
<li>Opposition to the Gandhi &ldquo;Constructive Program&rdquo; for revolutionary mass struggle.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Opposition to the attempt to bring trade unions and the Kisan Sabhas (organization of the small, land-owning peasants) under capitalist control or domination.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Release of all political prisoners.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Repeal of all repressive legislation.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>No compromise with imperialism.</li>
</ul>
