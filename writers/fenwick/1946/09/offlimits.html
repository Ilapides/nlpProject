<p class="info">From <strong>Labor Action</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/laboraction-ny/1946/index.htm#la10_35" target="new">Vol. 10 No. 35</a>, 2 September 1946, p.&nbsp;4.<br />

<p class="fst">A GI dad and his four-year-old son talk over the state of the nation:</p>

<p class="fst">SONNY: Daddy, who&rsquo;s General Omar N. Bradley?</p>

<p class="fst">DADDY: Why, he&rsquo;s head of the Veterans Administration, son.</p>

<p class="fst">SONNY: How did he happen to get that job?</p>

<p class="fst">DADDY: He was said to be the soldiers&rsquo; general &ndash; the friend of the veteran.</p>

<p class="fst">SONNY: Is that why he was opposed to increasing disabled veterans&rsquo; pensions by 20 per cent?</p>

<p class="fst">DADDY: I don&rsquo;t understand where you pick up such cynical remarks. Have you been reading that <strong>Labor Action</strong> again?</p>

<p class="fst">SONNY: But why was General Bradley opposed to increasing the pensions 20 per cent?</p>

<p class="fst">DADDY: He said it would be inflationary.</p>

<p class="fst">SONNY: Did General Bradley say that the entire $7,091,034,000 budget for the army next year was inflationary?</p>

<p class="fst">DADDY: If he did it wasn&rsquo;t above a whisper, son.</p>

<p class="fst">SONNY: Do officers ever whisper, daddy?</p>

<p class="fst">DADDY: No, the closest they ever come to it is when they lower their voices to a yell.</p>

<p class="fst">SONNY: Then why DIDN&rsquo;T he say it was inflationary?</p>

<p class="fst">DADDY: Because the army budget as a whole brings juicy profits to the capitalists. The pensions don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p class="fst">SONNY: But the capitalists didn&rsquo;t suffer in the war. It was the veterans who were killed and mutilated.</p>

<p class="fst">DADDY: That&rsquo;s right. But don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; the capitalists take care of their faithful servants. For instance, suppose I had lost a leg in the war. The government would pay me around $120 a month to live on.</p>

<p class="fst">SONNY: But you know you couldn&rsquo;t support yourself, and mother and me, on that,</p>

<p class="fst">DADDY: That&rsquo;s right. But not all veterans are that badly paid.</p>

<p class="fst">SONNY: How do you mean?</p>

<p class="fst">DADDY: Well, take General Bradley. A grateful government pays him $1,000 a month.</p>

<p class="fst">SONNY: But he HAS both legs!</p>

<p class="fst">DADDY: It&rsquo;s plain to see you&rsquo;re turning into a young troublemaker. Now get back to your volume 1 of <strong>Capital</strong>. Daddy wants to read about the Philadelphia policeman who is accused of robbing a dead man.</p>

<p class="fst">SONNY: What was the policeman&rsquo;s name &ndash; Andrew J. May?</p>

<p class="fst">DADDY: No, but I must admit it&rsquo;s a natural question for a person to ask. Now quiet, son &ndash; daddy&rsquo;s busy.</p>
