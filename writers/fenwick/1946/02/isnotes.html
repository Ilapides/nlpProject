<p class="fst">The Revolutionary Socialist Party, the Irish section of the Fourth
International, recently issued a statement advocating the immediate
fusion of the Workers Party and the Socialist Workers Party of the
United States.</p>

<p>A summary of their statement follows:</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Though the WP and the SWP differ in their analysis of Russia,
the two parties base themselves on the same programmatic
fundamentals. Yet even though the membership of the WP does not
believe that Russia is a degenerated workers&rsquo; state, they
&ldquo;objectively defend the nationalized property by virtue of the
fight they wage for the victory of the international socialist
revolution.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;The re-entry of experienced comrades and the addition of
the new cadres recruited by the WP would strengthen the SWP in its
fight to halt intervention&rdquo; by United States imperialism and
Stalinist Russia &ndash; the two most powerful counter-revolutionary
forces in the world today &ndash; in the unfolding of the
revolutionary situation in Europe.</p>

<p>The support of the concept of fusion is not decisively based upon
the recession in importance of the slogan of the defense of Russia
and its replacement by the slogan of the defense of the European
revolution from imperialism and the Stalinist state. Were this so, a
turn in international events which would menace Russia would raise
again the question of two separate parties.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Fundamental Agreement</h4>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Irrespective of the military situation of the
USSR, the basic revolutionary task of overthrowing imperialism still
confronts the workers of the world and it is because there is
agreement on this fundamental problem that we regard fusion as
imperative.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Will the danger be created, the statement continues, of internal
controversy paralyzing the work of the party? That is possible, but
it is part of the necessary overhead of a party based upon democratic
centralism.</p>

<p>Would the WP members split the party again? To help guard against
this it is proposed that &ldquo;the WP leaders publicly, before their
own supporters, admit their breach of Bolshevik discipline in 1940,&rdquo;
which would in some measure safeguard against this contingency.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;With regard to the dispute over the character
of the USSR, we believe an international discussion should be begun
on this question, published in the theoretical organs of the various
sections. Even though it may be contemplated that no new conclusions
of a fundamental character will be reached, it is still none the less
necessary to review and evaluate the evolution of the USSR since <B>In
Defense of Marxism</strong> was written.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">The statement is signed by Robert Armstrong, secretary of the
Revolutionary Socialist Party, Irish section of the Fourth
international.</p>

<h4>*</h4>

<p class="fst">The Workers Party can only commend the general point of view of
the Irish comrades. It is based upon a genuine concern for the
welfare of the revolutionary socialist movement in the United States.
As such it stands in healthy contrast to the majority leadership of
the SWP, which only toys with the question.</p>

<p>In proposing immediate fusion the Revolutionary Socialist Party
confirms what we have contended but what the bureaucratized majority
leadership of the SWP finds it hard to swallow, namely, that our
political differences are not such as to preclude our membership in
the same party.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Guarantee of Unity</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>The best guarantee for the preservation of a united party,
however, we find not in admitting to a non-existent &ldquo;breach of
Bolshevik discipline in 1940,&rdquo; but in haying the simple right
to publish our own internal bulletin within the single party.</em></p>

<p>On the proposal for a discussion within the International of the
Russian question, we are in hearty accord. And not only the Russian
question. There is a series of other problems, among them the
national question, which are of extreme importance. Events have
vindicated the position assumed by the Workers Party on these
questions with exemplary completeness. It is time to draw the balance
sheet and to begin the necessary theoretical rearming of the
International.</p>

<p>The concept of Cannon that we were outside the current of the
Fourth International existed only by virtue of bureaucratic fiat in
any event. Our revolutionary policies are making their way.</p>

<p>The statement of the Irish comrades is ample proof of that. It is
not the only one nor will it be the last one from within the ranks of
the Fourth International.</p>
