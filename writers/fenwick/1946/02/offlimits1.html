<p class="fst"><strong>THE REALITY IN 1946:</strong><br />
<br />
The United States has seized
and plans to hold through outright control or through
&ldquo;trusteeship&rdquo; numerous islands in the Pacific. The
United States and England occupy large parts of Germany. Russia
has seized Esthonia, Lithuania, Latvia, part of Poland and
extensive areas in the Orient. She occupies or basically controls
parts of Austria, Rumania, Bulgaria and Germany. She has raised
the demand for the control of Tripolitania. France demands Briga
and Tenda from Italy. She likewise occupies part of Germany. The
United States, England, France and Holland are busy reconquering
colonial countries wrested from them by the Japanese. An
additional, if less obvious, form of aggrandizement is the
economic domination of almost all the countries of the globe
except Russia by the United States dollar.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="fst"><strong>FIRST:</strong> Their countries seek no aggrandizement,
territorial or other.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="fst"><strong>SECOND:</strong> They desire to see no territorial changes that
do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the people
concerned.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="fst">One-half of Poland, over the violation of whose sovereignty by
the Nazis in 1939 Britain declared war on Germany, has been seized
by Russia without the consent of the people involved. Part of
Germany has been forcibly given to Poland. The rest of Germany and
Austria has been partitioned among the United States, Britain,
France and Russia &ndash; without consultation of the people
involved. Bulgaria and Rumania are ruled through &ldquo;the freely
expressed wishes of the NKVD and the Russian army. The colonial
peoples of India, Indochina, Indonesia and Palestine are
ruthlessly shot down by the imperialists who &ldquo;desire to see
no territorial changes.&rdquo; The Japanese Empire suffered
extensive territorial changes, over which its population had no
voice.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="fst"><strong>THIRD:</strong> They respect the right of all people to choose
the form of government under which they will live; and they wish
to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who
have been forcibly deprived of them.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="fst"><em>What resonant phrases! What a brutal reality! Britain
continues her bloody armed intervention in Greece against the
continuously expressed opposition of the overwhelming majority of
the people. For their crime of desiring to govern themselves,
Britain slaughters Indonesians behind a screen of British
censorship. Indians, who demonstrate because they wish &ldquo;to
see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who
have been forcibly deprived of them&rdquo; (by the British) are
casually shot down. France, completely equipped with American
arms, has been coldbloodedly destroying the Indo-Chinese
independence movement.</em></p>

<p>The United States occupies and politically dominates the
Philippines and part of Korea, despite the often expressed will of
the native populations. Chinese demonstrate for the withdrawal of
American troops. Russia militarily add politically dominates huge
areas in the Far East and in eastern Europe. Though the political
rule of Hitler has been overthrown, Germany is not permitted to
govern herself.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="fst"><strong>FOURTH:</strong> They will endeavor, with due respect for their
existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all states,
great or small, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the
raw materials of the world</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="fst">This means, on the one hand, the right of all imperialist
nations to exploit the great raw material producing countries of
the world such as India, Indochina, Indonesia, etc., who are now
opposing this &ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo; by armed force. On the other
hand, it means that a country like Germany, whose merchant fleet
has been destroyed, whose country is a catastrophic ruin, has the
right of &ldquo;access on equal terms to the trade and raw
materials! of the world.&rdquo; That is pure hypocrisy. The war
was fought for the subjugation of competing imperialisms such as
Germany and Japan, and the right of &ldquo;Allied&rdquo;
imperialisms to exploit the colonial areas of the world.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="fst"><strong>FIFTH:</strong> They desire to bring about the fullest
collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the
object of securing, for all, improved labor standards, economic
advancement and social security.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="fst">Translated into non-diplomatic language, this &ldquo;fullest
collaboration&rdquo; is the same type of collaboration that exists
between the hangman and the hanged. The &ldquo;economic
advancement&rdquo; of Germany is furthered by the pillage of
machinery, destruction of plants, limitation of production, and
appropriation of coal. &ldquo;Allied&rdquo; countries are
permitted to exist on even a low level thanks only to huge
American loans. Colonies of Great Britain are prohibited by law
from having independent trade relations with other countries.
Everywhere, tariff barriers impede free trade. Where countries
could theoretically engage in trade, the war has so weakened their
economy, destroyed their shipping and prevented the accumulation
of an excess, that trade stagnates.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="fst"><strong>SIXTH:</strong> After the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny,
they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all
nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own
boundaries, and which will afford assurance that all the men in
all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and
want.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="fst"><em>Peace! &ldquo;After the final destruction of Nazi tyranny&rdquo;
fighting rages in Indonesia, Indodhina, China, India and
Palestine. Even before World War II was over, the monarchs of
capitalism began their hopeful whispering of a World War III
against Russia. Freedom from fear! And the whole world quakes
before the atomic bomb, knowing that capitalism, completely
irresponsible, and caught up in its own contradictions, will
hardly hesitate to destroy the globe itself. Freedom from want!
The Nazi tyranny is dead, and in Europe and the Orient whole
populations, where they are not barely subsisting, are starving
and freezing. Life has coasted almost to a stop.</em></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="fst"><strong>SEVENTH:</strong> Such a peace should enable all men to traverse
the high seas and oceans without hindrance.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="fst">&ldquo;Such a peace&rdquo; is proving almost unendurable. Who
may &ldquo;traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance&rdquo;?
Only the United States, British, French and Dutch armies of
occupation being sent out to hold down all the colonial peoples of
the globe and the defeated populations of Germany and Japan. (The
freedom for these soldiers to return home is more limited!) Only
the vultures of the foreign offices of the world, busy weaving the
oppression of other peoples, only the inquisitors of world
capitalism, tightening the screws of economic <em>plunder
everywhere &ndash; only these are free to travel. But the Jews &ndash;
those who are still alive &ndash; and the other oppressed people
of Europe who wish to flee the agony of life on the continent &ndash;
where is their freedom &ldquo;to traverse the high seas&rdquo;?</em></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="fst"><strong>EIGHTH:</strong> They believe that all of the nations of the
world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons, must come to
the abandonment of the use of force ... They will likewise aid and
encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for
peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="fst">&ldquo;The abandonment of the use of force&rdquo; proceeds in
normal capitalist fashion &ndash; that is to say, by the
continuing application of it. Demobilization in the United States
and England moves slowly. In France it does not move at all.
Feverish scientific research in armaments continues. As steps &ldquo;to
lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burdens of
armaments,&rdquo; the War Department plans a 1,500,000 man army by
mid-year, and Truman advocates peacetime compulsory military
training. Every session of the United Nations Organization becomes
a tug of war over the atomic bomb, colonies, sources of raw
materials, and military bases. The complete destruction of
civilization is being prepared!</p>
