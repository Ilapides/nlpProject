<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">In comparing World War I and World War II, one of the most
arresting and obvious differences is that in 1918 the coming of peace
was accelerated by the revolutionary activity of German soldiers and
sailors, while in 1945 the German soldier fought until he was driven
from the last pile of rubble in Berlin.</p>

<p>Despite a two-to-one allied numerical superiority in troops,
complete allied domination of the air, a lack of materiel, the nearly
complete destruction of the homeland, a ghastly number of casualties,
and an unbroken chain of defeats beginning as far back as Stalingrad
and El Alamein, there were no significant signs among the German
soldiers of a revolt against their fearful conditions.</p>

<p>There are even many Marxists who, mechanically drawing
revolutionary conclusions from the deep-going economic and political
decay of capitalism, fail to understand, this characteristic of the
times. The Socialist Workers Party of the United States, for
instance, commits this error. Many French Trotskyists, who are not
ungifted political analysts, expected revolts to break out in the
German army at the time of the invasion of Normandy, and similar
revolts to take place on the German home front. Such actions, we are
compelled to record, did not occur. Why not?<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Why the Germans Kept Fighting</h4>

<p class="fst">There was scarcely an American soldier who did not say on more
than one occasion, &ldquo;Why did they keep on fighting? They know
they&rsquo;re licked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are several reasons. Among them was the tight control
exercised by the Gestapo and the SS troops. The exceptionally large
number of German troops shot for one form of insubordination or
another is a testimony to the hatred of the war that existed in the
common soldier. The effectiveness of the repressive measures is
likewise apparent.</p>

<p>The maintenance of discipline was facilitated, of course, by the
elimination of revolutionary socialist elements from the population
in the six years of Hitler&rsquo;s rule prior to the war. The number
of such persons &ndash; and they were the most courageous, the most
conscious members of the working class &ndash; runs into hundreds of
thousands.</p>

<p><em>The German was snared, also, by the Hitler demagogy, which
could not be answered effectively by capitalist counter-argument. For
example, take the Hitler demand for <strong>Lebensraum</strong> (living space)
and for colonies. How could England, for instance, ever plausibly
oppose this demand in the eyes of the German people while retaining
her own crown colonies?</em></p>

<p>Hitler&rsquo;s plea could be effectively countered only by
socialists, who demand freedom of ALL colonies. The socialist order,
as contrasted with the capitalist one, is the only one which makes
economic well-being possible without the enslavement of colonial
peoples. Hence, allied propaganda was doomed to remain ineffective.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Decisive Lack</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>In Russia in 1917 and in Germany in 1918. it was a socialist
agitation which brought, or aided in bringing, the bloody slaughter
to a close. That type of agitation, of course, is impossible for the
capitalists, for by its nature it involves a struggle against one&rsquo;s
own government as well as the government of the enemy country. The
soldier says, in effect, to the enemy soldier, &ldquo;Look &ndash;
what have we got against each other? Why don&rsquo;t you fight those
on your side who wish to continue this slaughter. I&rsquo;ll do the
same on my side, and we&rsquo;ll put an end to this business.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Instead, the capitalists up until the last days of the war
ceaselessly sowed the idea that all Germans were guilty. The Allies
were unable (and unwilling) to split the German enlisted man from his
officers and to offer the prospect of a better world. Only socialists
can do that. All that the Allies could promise was the
de-industrialization of a great capitalist country &ndash; that is to
say, to introduce capitalist barbarism in Germany.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that the German soldier, deadly tired of the war
as he was, fought hopelessly on to the bitter end.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What Might Have Been</h4>

<p class="fst">Within the ranks of the working class the socialists, and the
Stalinists in particular, who substituted national hatred for
socialist fraternization, bear the heaviest responsibility. The
workers of all countries paid for it in a needless prolongation of
the war.</p>

<p><em>What might have been achieved by a correct policy was revealed
in action by French Trotskyists. Fraternization was conducted with
German soldiers so successfully that they even aided the resistance
movement with arms, rubber stamps for forging identity papers, etc.</em></p>

<p>In Paris the French comrades would hold up German soldiers on the
street at night in order to secure their weapons. The following is a
typical episode:</p>

<p>One soldier who was held up, thinking that our comrades were
stick-up men, automatically handed over his brief case, which was
found to contain around twenty packages of cigarettes, which were
very valuable on the black market. Our comrades handed it back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not bandits. We&rsquo;re socialist
internationalists. We have nothing against you. You are a victim of
the war like ourselves. Our enemy is your enemy &ndash; the Gestapo
and the SS. We want your pistol to protect ourselves from them, and
to fight them and their counterparts in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll be disciplined for turning up without my
pistol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in danger, too. But only in the struggle for
socialism can we bring the war to a close.&rdquo; They continued the
discussion briefly.</p>

<p>In the end the soldier gave up his pistol voluntarily, shook hands
with our comrades, and wished them good luck.</p>

<p><em>That little incident multiplied a thousand-fold would have
brought the world slaughter to a crashing stop.</em></p>

<p><em>For the lack of it millions of men, women, and children lost
their lives, and the world has posed before it the threat of another
and more horrible world war.</em></p>

<p><em>Only the international socialist revolution can save humankind.</em></p>
