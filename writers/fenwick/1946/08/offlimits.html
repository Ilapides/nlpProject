<p class="info">From <strong>Labor Action</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/laboraction-ny/1946/index.htm#la10_31" target="new">Vol. 10 No. 31</a>, 5 August 1946, p. 4.<br />

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">The article in the paper was plain enough. It read:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;FRANKFORT, July 12 &ndash; (AP) &ndash; Ninety-six
American soldiers were arrested by U.S. Third Army military police
during the last six days for public petting with German frauleins, it
was announced today.</p>

<p class="quote">&rdquo;The arrests were made following General Joseph T.
McNarney&rsquo;s crackdown on displays of affection.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst"><I>What a madhouse this world of capitalism is! For participating
in the basic and humanizing relation existing between man and woman
anonymous G.I.&rsquo;s are arrested and fined, or &ldquo;turned over
to their commanding officers for disciplinary action.&rdquo; For
having helped organize the destruction of a continent and the death
and mutilation of millions of both Germans and Americans General
Eisenhower is enthroned as a national hero!</I></p>

<p>And thrice-mad seems a world in which the incident can pass
without even rippling the public conscience.</p>

<h4>*</h4>

<p class="fst">I cannot help thinking of Bavaria a year ago. The war had just
ended. The six-year agony was over. Out of that nightmare of air
raids, constant fear and despair, of husbands or lovers dead or
prisoners in Russia &ndash; and good as dead, hunger, destruction,
and a bleak future, German women began to piece together their lives.</p>

<p>It would have been in opposition to all laws of nature had these
women and lonely American soldiers not sought each other out. To see
couples laughing together in the bars, or strolling through the green
shade of the benches in the parks was to reassure oneself that
beneath the fierce nationalistic propaganda of both the nazis and the
American government the desire of the common people of the earth for
peace and friendship would reassert itself.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Army&rsquo;s Reply</h4>

<p class="fst">The response of American officers was typical. Normal human
relations with the population were prohibited or discouraged. As a
result, relations between the sexes sank to the level of intrigue or
shabby relations from which all love and companionship soon were
driven.</p>

<p><I>This policy, of course, was not a product of the arrogance,
petty meanness, and ignorance which characterize the officer caste.
It was part of the plan of United States capital for keeping Germany
in the status of a subject nation powerless to compete with the
United States on the world market.</I></p>

<p>But every noble political abstraction in Washington ends in most
human consequences in Germany. The result is the punishment of
enlisted men for the impudence of desiring a woman&rsquo;s warmth,
the commercializing of human relations, the suicides of German women
whose lovers have been redeployed to the United States, and the
driving out of Germany of men who wish to take German women as wives.</p>

<p>There is the world from which hate was to be abolished!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Working Class&rsquo; Answer</h4>

<p class="fst">In the midst of the national hatreds which seethe in Europe the
working class, however, is slowly, very slowly, re-establishing the
great principles of international solidarity.</p>

<p><I>In Belgium, German soldier slave labor is used to work the coal
mines; Despite despicable threats upon their lives these German
workers recently struck in solidarity with Belgian miners who were
protesting horrible working conditions which produced a disaster in
which many German and Belgian workers were killed. Belgian workers in
turn later demonstrated against burying the German victims separately
in paupers&rsquo; graves.</I></p>

<p>In that courageous action lies the answer to the capitalist
program of hatred in perpetuity in which they would like to drown
every human decency doggedly established by mankind in its long
ascent from primeval darkness.</p>
