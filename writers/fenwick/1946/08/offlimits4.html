<p class="info">From <strong>Labor Action</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/laboraction-ny/1946/index.htm#la10_34" target="new">Vol. 10 No. 34</a>, 26 August 1946, p.&nbsp;4.<br />

<p class="fst">We revolutionary socialists are often accused of being biased, of
being unable to see the capitalist&rsquo;s point of view. After all,
we are often informed, the capitalists have their troubles too. And,
really &ndash; they do.</p>

<p>If you are one of those soldiers or sailors who went through the
recent war and, having seen what nightmarish cascades of rubble so
much of Europe and the Far East were reduced to, break out in a sweat
at night when you think of the horrors of an atomic war &ndash; don&rsquo;t
worry. The capitalists are sweating too.</p>

<p><I>Of course they are not worrying about quite the same thing as
you are. They have accepted the war itself. What they are mulling
over is another problem which the underwater atom bomb test at Bikini
revealed.</I></p>

<p>What is worrying them is the deadly radioactivity which is induced
in the sea water, in the atomic cloud, and on the ships by the
explosion.<br />

<h4>The Burning Problem</h4>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;... A new and difficult kind of morale must be
built up to combat the invisible killer, radioactivity,&rdquo; says
Hanson W. Baldwin in the <B>New York Times</B>.</I></p>

<p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;Crews doomed to slow death from exposure to
lethal radioactivity are nevertheless able the first few days after
exposure to continue normal duties. The seamen of tomorrow must be
prepared to accept radioactivity as part of the hazards of their
living and be ready to work and fight and save their ship even though
they know they are doomed to slow death.&rdquo;</I></p>

<p class="fst">So you see it&rsquo;s not all skittles and beer for the
capitalists, either.</p>

<h4>*</h4>

<p class="fst">The interesting problem of the creation of &ldquo;a new and
difficult kind of morale&rdquo; we leave to the generals, the
admirals, and the Hanson W. Baldwins who have so cold-bloodedly
revealed the type of world they are building for us and our children.</p>

<p>Our job is just as cold-bloodedly to create a socialist morale
which will bring a final end to war and change radioactivity from an
atomic pestilence devastating whole peoples to the greatest
liberating force which mankind has yet been able to apply to nature.</p>
