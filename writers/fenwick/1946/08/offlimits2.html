<h1>Off Limits</h1>

<h3>(12 August 1946)</h3>

<hr class="infotop" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Labor Action</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/laboraction-ny/1946/index.htm#la10_32" target="new">Vol. 10 No. 32</a>, 12 August 1946, p.&nbsp;4.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>ETOL</strong>.</p>

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">General Omar N. Bradley, known far and wide by his public
relations office, his relatives and his Ralph Ingersoll, editor of
<strong>PM</strong>, as &ldquo;the soldier&rsquo;s general,&rdquo; last Memorial Day
chose to enlighten a world in which only a few, alas, can be generals
and so many of us, not smart like General Bradley, must be content to
remain the eternal enlisted man.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;By this time,&rdquo;</I> he said, <i>&ldquo;we
should have learned that no one is richer by war. All are poorer
including the victors.&rdquo;</I></p>

<p class="fst">Such a statement, half insolence and half idiocy, enlisted men
have long since learned to expect from army officers, and General
Bradley may even believe it himself. But no one else is thereby
obligated to believe it, especially since the breaking of the Garsson
case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All are poorer, including the victors.&rdquo; That is a
lie. Only the working class is poorer because of the war. For the
capitalist class the war years were golden ones. The career even of
Murray Garsson, who is, it should be remembered, actually a nobody
among the real rulers of this country &ndash; the capitalists &ndash;
proves it.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Up from Slavery</h4>

<p class="fst">Beginning only with a non-existent firm&rsquo;s letterhead and an
unshakable faith in the corruptibility of congressmen, Garsson
quickly ran this into a chain of firms which handled $78,000,000 in
war contracts. Garsson, a former associate of the gangster Dutch
Schultz, did not invest a cent of his own money. The government
financed everything.</p>

<p>Associated with Garsson in his patriotic enterprise were such
typical characters as Benjamin F. Fields, an ex-convict. With such
persons involved, it is not surprising that the business was
conducted on a moral level considerably lower than those noble ideals
for which the war was supposedly fought.</p>

<p>Andrew J. May, chairman, no less, of the House Military Affairs
Committee, accepted bribes from the Garsson firm for &ldquo;favors&rdquo;
he was able to extend it.</p>

<p>Albert W. Jacobson, a legal adviser in the Chemical Warfare
Service, who handled contract approving, was paid $20,000 a year by
the Garsson company.</p>

<p>Expensive Christmas gifts were given to assorted generals and
other officers in the Chemical Warfare Service who were in a position
to aid the profit-making activities of the Garssons.</p>

<p>May intervened personally with General Eisenhower when Garsson&rsquo;s
son, a captain in the Chemical Warfare Service, was
court-martialed.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Real Situation</h4>

<p class="fst">In short, the Garssons and their political and military friends,
like the capitalist class as a whole, of which they are a small part,
emerged from the war richer than ever before.</p>

<p>They should have, for World War II was their war. It was fought
primarily to contest the world trade market menaced by the expansion
of German and Japanese capitalism.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;All are poorer ...&rdquo;? No, only the working class of
all countries is poorer. For it was they who were killed and
mutilated in the war, it was they who worked long hours in the shops,
it is they who now are confronted with inflation, poverty,
destruction of their homeland, and the prospect of an atomic war.</I></p>

<p>The Garssons, their capitalist betters, and their soldiers like
you, General Bradley, emerged from the war quite satisfied.</p>

<p>You will pardon us if we don&rsquo;t believe you.</p>
