Chief, Chemical Warfare Service<br />
U.S.
Army</p>

<p class="fst">Dear General Waitt:</p>

<p class="fst">To tell the truth &ndash; and don&rsquo;t let that strange word
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; frighten you, dear general! &ndash; I never
expected to find myself writing to an officer in the U.S. Army.</p>

<p>After all, as a former pfc I have a certain self-respect to
maintain, especially since it turns out that you and other
untouchables who had the power of life and death over us in the
recent war, seem to have been pretty chummy with Murray Garsson, the
war profiteer, who numbered among his friends ex-convicts and more
amateur scoundrels like representative May, chairman of the House
Military Affairs Committee.</p>

<p>But you seem so dishonestly confused and ignorant on the career of
the 4.2 mortar which was supposed to be your specialty that I cannot
resist writing. Of course, to do you justice, you may be quite
<I>honestly</I> confused or ignorant. Those qualities, in fact, along
with several other nasty characteristics, seem to be an occupational
disease with army officers. But in either case a letter is in
order.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>To Refresh Your Memory</h4>

<p class="fst">One of the facts you seem especially vogue on is the number of men
killed by premature explosions of defective 4.2 shells. I was not
with a chemical mortar battalion during the war, I was with the
infantry. But out of my limited experience I want to give you a few
names, a date, and a place, in order to refresh that conveniently
poor memory of yours.</p>

<p><I>On September 15, 1944, the second battalion of the 16th
infantry was on the outskirts of Brand, Germany. Its attack was being
supported by the 81th chemical battalion. (Its field code name was
Camel White.) In the midst of the heavy firing a 4.2 shell exploded
prematurely, killing one enlisted man and wounding seven others.</I></p>

<p>I remember the incident as if it were yesterday, dear General
Waitt, because of a little act of bravery and self-sacrifice which
occurred and which must be so incomprehensible to a person like you.
One of the wounded men who was being loaded on a jeep-ambulance rose
up on his elbow on the stretcher and said, &ldquo;Take care of the
other group first. They&rsquo;re wounded worse than I am.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A Few Reflections</h4>

<p class="fst">I have often thought of those men who died or were wounded in that
pleasant field in Germany on a sunny September afternoon. Do you know
what conclusion I&rsquo;ve come to? Those men were killed or wounded
through their own negligence. They just weren&rsquo;t very smart.</p>

<p>Because if they had been smart they would have chosen rich parents
like Murray Garsson, who manufactured those same 4.2 mortars. Then,
like Captain Joseph Garsson, his son, they would have had friends
like Andrew May, chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee,
who would have seen that they were &ldquo;protected and taken care
of&rdquo; while they were in the army &ndash; especially from those
notoriously treacherous 4.2 mortars.</p>

<p>And if they had been court-martialed they would have had you to
intervene directly with General Eisenhower, as you did for Captain
Garsson, carrying a letter from representative May asking for a
special investigation because Captain Garsson&rsquo;s father &ldquo;is
one of my warm personal friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s why I always come back to the same conclusion:
those men who died or were wounded weren&rsquo;t smart. They chose
the wrong parents. They should have chosen parents like the Garssons,
with their hired fixers in Congress, their army lickspittles like
you, their gilded women, their buddies from the underworld, and their
Wall Street friends &ndash; all of whom &ldquo;took care&rdquo; of
themselves very well during the war.</p>

<p>Yes, they &ldquo;took care&rdquo; of themselves very well &ndash;
and far better than those men of the 87th chemical battalion lying
dead and wounded in a now forgotten field in Germany two years ago
were able to.</p>
