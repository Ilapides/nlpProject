<p class="fst">The decay of world capitalism is the condition that prepared the foundation for the Industrial Recovery Act.</p>

<p>The Industrial Recovery Act can be summed up as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is an attempt to prop up a tottering and decaying capitalist system.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It is an attempt to organize production; instead it will enlarge all of the basic contradictions.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It is an attempt to regulate competition; instead it will intensify competition.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It has the elements of state capitalism.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The defeat of the German working class by Fascism has caused a political regrouping in world politics and has accelerated the American imperialists&#8217; attempt to reorganize the internal economic forces in preparation for more effective international struggles and for war.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It reveals to a greater extent the true role of the state as an instrument of suppression for the dominating class. The partnership of government and industry is not new. Only the form of a relationship is changing, from a concealed to a more open form.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It will organize Cartels through government aid.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It will result in a government subsidy to the big capitalists and the &#8220;sick&#8221; industries and is part of the plan to raise the price level of commodities.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It is a method of eliminating the small producers.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The establishment of the codes and the minimum wage for each industry, suitable for the big capitalists with large constant capital, modern methods of production and a high degree of exploitation, will eliminate the small producers who cannot live up to the <em>new form</em> of competition.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The right to curtail production through the code agreements is a weapon in the hands of the big capitalists against the small producers.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It will result in a lower standard of living for the American workers.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>Speed up and rationalization will be intensified.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The real wages of the working class will be reduced regardless of what the money wage may be.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It will establish a low minimum wage which will become the average and then the maximum.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The reduction of hours as presented by the code is the stagger plan. The 30 hour week is a denial of and a caricature of the six hour day and five day week.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It will establish a class collaboration machinery to hold in check the working class. Arbitration will be established for every industry.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It is an attempt to head off the class upheavals in the near future.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It is an attempt to prevent strikes. It will outlaw strikes. Strikes will be against the bosses&#8217; government. The capitalists will hide behind the American flag to a far greater degree.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The code makes provisions for a money wage increase of from 5 percent to 10 percent to prevent strikes due to the rapid rise in commodity prices.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The workers&#8217; &#8220;rights&#8221; under the code only begin after the employees threaten to repudiate the employers&#8217; slave codes &#8211; then the capitalists and their government will resort to arbitration to prevent strikes.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It is an attempt to side-step the dole and social insurance, absorbing some of the unemployed through the stagger plan and by the inauguration of a public works program for the benefits of the contractors&#8217; and capitalists&#8217; profits, to employ some of the unemployed for the equivalent of relief.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It is an attempt to prevent the establishment of class struggle unions and instead to maintain the <em>status quo</em>, or to establish Company Unions &#8211; or safe conservative unions such as the A.F.L.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It is an attempt to reorganize the surplus labor power to the high productive forces of American industries.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The Industrial Recovery Act is an admission of the bankruptcy of the capitalist mode of production and is an unworkable substitute for the solution &#8211; the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system and the establishment of a Workers&#8217; Government.</li>
