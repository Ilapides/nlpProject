<p class="fst">The recognition of the Soviet Union by the United States, with long term credits and trade relations is a desirable step and would be a most favorable condition to offset the difficulties and contradictions confronting the Soviet Union, primarily due to the wrong policies of Stalinism. The possibilities of recognition by the United States have been increased due to the difficulties pressing down upon American imperialism. America is by no means intending to change her stripes. It has become profitable for American capitalism to recognize the Soviet Union and unless some new developments upset the present relationship, it probably will.</p>

<p>Diplomatic and trade relations with capitalist nations by a workers government are born of realistic necessity and constitute for it, a temporary concession. It should not be explained to the workers as a peaceful co-existing of two systems, as Litvinoff does.</p>

<p>Likewise, the treaty with Fascist Germany and the latest moves in regard to the Chinese Eastern Railroad can only be understood if one realizes that they are necessary steps due to the mistakes of Stalinism and are a sign of weakness and not a sign of strength or the &#8220;victory of socialism&#8221;.</p>

<p>With recognition, America will attempt to use her experts and agents inside of the Soviet Union to undermine the workers&#8217; government and to establish relations with the enemies and Thermidorian element. At the same time America will be forced to help Germany find a way out, in order to save the billions invested there. Germany is already moving in the direction of attack on the Soviet Union, as the path of least resistance</p>

<p>Imperialist recognition of the Soviet Union carries with it the danger of counter-revolutionary activity within the Soviet Union. Such action is to be expected. Our policy must be to overcome these contradictions carried with recognition by imperialism. It will be extremely difficult to overcome these difficulties with the policies of Stalinism. The Left Opposition must say this frankly. The Left Opposition, while understanding and approving the forced concessions such as the treaties with Fascist Germany, etc., must at the same time warn the world proletariat that the contradictions carried with these concessions cannot be overcome if the policy of Stalinism continues. The criminal policy of Stalinism in the Soviet Union and the C.I. must be replaced with a return to Marxism; the theory of socialism in one country and all that flows from it throughout the world Communist parties must be replaced with the Marxian theory of the Permanent Revolution.</p>
