<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1933/index.htm#tm33_05" target="new">Vol. VI No. 5</a>, 4 February 1933, p.&#160;1.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">The drive to SAVE THE <strong>MILITANT</strong> is the first order of business of the League and its sympathizers in the present period. We are confronted with the most serious financial condition possible and unless we obtain several hundred dollars, the very existence of the <strong>Militant</strong> is threatened. On top of this, the Post Office threatens to revoke our mailing rights if we skip another issue.</p>

<p>What are you doing about this? Have you called on your fellow-workers and ask for contributions? Help Save the <strong>Militant</strong>. Send in your contribution at once and then visit your friends and collect funds for the <strong>Militant</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Militant</strong> has performed an international revolutionary duty to the class and the party in keeping the Marxian theories and the Bolshevik-Leninist needs of the day before the English-speaking workers of the whole world. While the press of Stalinism sways between opportunism and adventurism the <strong>Militant</strong> has held high the international revolutionary principles of Marxism. The need of the organization is not a retreat to a semi-monthly but an Increase in propaganda in order to keep pace with the growing activity of the League and the sharpening world events. In all parts of the country the demand for our press and our literature is on the increase. The demand is one positive side of the problem. The other side is the organizational end. We must send out organizers, but all this will fail of accomplishment unless the <strong>Militant</strong> is kept before the workers each week.</p>

<p>You cannot allow the financial difficulties to drown the voice of the <strong>Militant</strong>. You must strain every resource to help SAVE THE <strong>MILITANT</strong>. Send in your contribution at once, solicit funds for the Militant. Rush all Funds to the <strong>Militant</strong>, 126 East 16th St., New York City.</p>
