<p class="fst">It has become a clich&#233; to say that the ideas of empire and
imperialism have enjoyed a renaissance in the early years of the 21st
century. The main reasons for this are, of course, the global primacy
of the United States and the arrogance with which the Bush
administration has flaunted this pre-eminence, above all in the
military field. Marxists should be particularly well equipped to
respond to this development, given the importance that their
tradition has given to the concept of imperialism. More particularly,
the Marxist theory of imperialism is distinctive in that it does not
treat empire simply as a transhistorical form of political domination
&#8211; as in, for example, Michael Doyle&#8217;s succinct definition of
imperialism as &#8216;effective control, whether formal or informal, of a
subordinated society by an imperial society&#8217; &#8211; but rather sets
modern imperialism in the context of the historical development of
the capitalist mode of production. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p>There are, of course, different versions of this intellectual
enterprise, which seeks systematically to relate geopolitical
relations to the process of capital accumulation. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> The variant on
which I intend to concentrate was developed during the First World
War, notably by Lenin in <strong>Imperialism</strong> (1916) and by Nikolai
Bukharin in <strong>Imperialism and World Economy</strong> (1917). Stated most
rigorously by Bukharin, what I henceforth call the classical Marxist
theory of imperialism affirms that capitalism in its imperialist
stage is defined by two potentially conflicting tendencies: (1) the
internationalisation of production, circulation and investment and
(2) the interpenetration of private capital and the nation-state. In
consequence, an increasingly integrated world economy becomes the
arena for competition among capitals that tends now to take the form
of geopolitical conflict among states. The First and Second World
Wars were from this perspective inter-imperialist conflicts
reflecting antagonisms at the heart of capitalism in its imperialist stage.</p>

<p>The classical theory of imperialism, particularly in Bukharin&#8217;s
hands, suffered from serious defects &#8211; notably, a tendency to view
the state as a mere instrument of capital, dependence on Rudolf
Hilferding&#8217;s theory of crises, which reduces them to the effects of
imbalances between different branches of production, and the
assumption that the trend towards state capitalism was a finished
result. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> Nevertheless, stripped of these features and integrated
into a rigorous theorisation of capitalism&#8217;s crisis tendencies, the
classical theory is, in my view, an indispensable instrument for
understanding the contemporary world.</p>
<p>From this perspective modern imperialism
 is what happens where two
previously distinct forms of competition merged, as they did in the
late 19th century: (1) economic competition between capitals; (2)
geopolitical competition between states.</p>

<p>A century or two earlier these two competitive logics had been
distinct, rooted in different modes of production: on the one hand
economic competition in the nascent capitalist world system; on the
other geopolitical competition in what Robert Brenner calls the
process of &#8216;political accumulation&#8217; &#8211; military expansion and
state-building &#8211; characteristic of feudalism that drove the
formation of the European state system. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> Imperialism represents
the moment at which these two logics become integrated. Geopolitical
competition can no longer be pursued without the economic resources
that could only be generated within the framework of capitalist
relations of production; but capitals involved in increasingly global
networks of trade and investment depend on different forms of
support, ranging from tariff and subsidy to the assertion of military
power, from their nation-state. Another way to put it is that the
competitive struggle among what Marx in the <strong>Grundrisse</strong> called
&#8216;many capitals&#8217; now assumes two forms, economic and geopolitical. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p>David Harvey expresses a very similar view when he calls
&#8216;capitalist imperialism&#8217; the &#8216;contradictory fusion&#8217; of two
logics of power, what he calls (following Giovanni Arrighi) the
capitalist and the territorial:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The relationship between these two logics should be seen
therefore as problematic and often contradictory (that is,
dialectical) rather than as functional or one-sided. This dialectical
relationship sets the stage for an analysis of capitalist imperialism
in terms of the intersection of these two distinct but intertwined
logics of power. The problem for concrete analyses of actual
situations is to keep the two sides of this dialectic simultaneously
in motion and not to lapse into either a solely political or a
predominantly economic mode of argumentation. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Other writers, notably Walden Bello, Peter Gowan, Chris Harman,
John Rees and Claude Serfati, have pursued a broadly similar
approach. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> Many contemporary radical theorists, however, argue
that the classical Marxist theory of imperialism is no longer
pertinent. Hardt and Negri famously assert that inter-imperialist
rivalries have been transcended in the transnational network power of
Empire. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But a much more carefully stated and empirically supported
critique of the classical Marxist theory has been developed in recent
years by Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> Since this is part of a
broader effort to transform our understanding of American imperialism
and reorient the radical left, it seems worth paying some attention
to it. Accordingly, this article is devoted to assessing this
critique and the alternative analysis it seeks to support.</p>

<p>The particular interest of this debate lies in the fact that,
whereas the assertion of US global power by the Bush administration
is widely seen as constituting the refutation of Hardt&#8217;s and
Negri&#8217;s theory (which announces the transcendence of national
antagonisms under Empire), Panitch and Gindin go to the opposite
extreme, arguing that the era of globalisation saw the entrenchment
of America&#8217;s &#8216;informal empire&#8217;. At the same time, they move
from different premises from those of Hardt and Negri to the same
conclusion, that geopolitical competition has largely been
transcended in contemporary capitalism.</p>

<p>According to Panitch and Gindin:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The classical theories of imperialism developed at the
time [of the First World War], from Hobson&#8217;s to Lenin&#8217;s, were
founded on a theorisation of capitalism&#8217;s economic stages and
crises. This was a fundamental mistake that has, ever since,
continued to plague proper understanding. The classical theories were
defective in their historical reading of imperialism, in their
treatment of the dynamics of capital accumulation, and in their
elevation of a conjunctural moment of inter-imperial rivalry to an
immutable law of globalisation (<strong>Global Capitalism and American
Empire</strong> (London 2004), hereafter <strong>GCAE</strong>, p.&nbsp;16).</p>

<p class="fst">Running through these errors is a failure to appreciate the
importance in conceptualising imperialism as a proper understanding
of:</p>

<p class="quoteb">states&#8217; relatively autonomous role in maintaining
social order and securing the conditions of capital accumulation ...
Capitalist imperialism, then, must be understood through an extension
of the capitalist theory of the state, rather than derived directly
from the theory of economic stages or crises. And such a theory needs
to comprise not only inter-imperial rivalry, and the conjunctural
predominance of one imperial state, but also the structural
penetration of former rivals by one imperial state (<strong>GCAE</strong>, pp.&nbsp;18&#8211;19).</p>

<p class="fst">The repeated phrase &#8216;one imperial state&#8217; gives the key to
Panitch and Gindin&#8217;s analysis of imperialism. Rather like J.R.R.
Tolkien&#8217;s &#8216;one ring to rule them all&#8217;, taking states seriously
means for them acknowledging the dominance of one state in
particular. More precisely their argument can be rendered down as
follows <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Following Poulantzas, Panitch and Gindin claim that the
post-war era was characterised by &#8216;the internationalisation of the
state, understood as a state&#8217;s acceptance of responsibility for
managing its own domestic capitalist order in way [sic] that
contributes to managing the international capitalist order&#8217; (GCAE,
p42). The US used the Cold War system of alliances and the Bretton
Woods international financial institutions to construct a global
capitalist order in which not simply were the economies of Western
Europe and Japan laid open to American capital, but the US state and
transnational corporations were able systematically to penetrate and
reorganise under its leadership the ruling classes of these zones of
advanced capitalism: &#8216;With American capital a social force within
each European country, domestic capital tended to be
&#8220;dis-articulated&#8221; and no longer represented by a coherent and
independent national bourgeoisie&#8217; (<strong>GCAE</strong>, p.&nbsp;47). <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>This order came under strain with the economic and monetary
crisis of the 1970s. Panitch and Gindin rely on a version of what
Robert Brenner has called &#8216;supply-side theories of crisis&#8217;: in
other words, they trace the recessions, inflation and monetary
instability of the 1970s back to the relative strength that
organised labour built up during the post-war boom and that it was
able to use to increase wages and thereby to bring down the rate of
profit. Thus they describe &#8216;working class resistance as both a
pivotal factor in causing the crisis and a target of its resolution
at the end of the 1970s and beginning of the 1980s&#8217;. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> &#8216;The
critical &#8220;turning point&#8221; in policy orientation came in 1979 with
the &#8220;Volcker shock&#8221; &#8211; the American state&#8217;s self-imposed
structural adjustment programme&#8217; (<strong>GCAE</strong>, p.&nbsp;50). The
sharp hike in interest rates and imposition of restrictions on the
monetary base announced by Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, in October 1979 was the US version of Margaret
Thatcher&#8217;s simultaneous monetarist offensive in Britain. It
sharply slowed down the American economy, and in doing so, Panitch
and Gindin argue, it accelerated the process of industrial
restructuring that broke the power of organised labour and attracted
capital back to the US. The ensuing profits recovery provided the
background against which the global order was &#8216;reconstituted&#8217; on
a neo-liberal basis that more tightly integrated the ruling classes
of advanced capitalism under American leadership through
institutions such as the G7 and the International Monetary Fund and
through the global economic hegemony of finance, a change that
reinforced the dominance of US capitalism.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The structure forged at the beginning of the 1980s holds
good today, Panitch and Gindin argue. If anything it is stronger now
than it was then. Not only has the Soviet Union gone, but, &#8216;while
the earlier period was characterised by the relative economic
strength of Europe and Japan, the current moment underlines their
relative weakness&#8217; (<strong>GCAE</strong>, p.&nbsp;55). It is, moreover,
quite misleading to characterise economic competition within the
advanced capitalist world as a case of &#8216;inter-imperialist
rivalries&#8217;. Not simply does this overstate the extent of the
competition, which unfolds within the context of a global
neo-liberal economic order dominated by the US, but the implication
that these economic tensions might be translated into geopolitical
confrontations, even military rivalries, is entirely false. The
European Union&#8217;s attempts to develop military capabilities are
feeble and dependent on NATO, while Japan remains heavily reliant on
America&#8217;s markets and security shield.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">The conclusion that Panitch and Gindin draw from this analysis is
not to invite us, in the face of the evidence, to conclude that all
is well with the contemporary imperial order:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There is indeed a systemic complexity in today&#8217;s global
capitalism that includes, even at its core, instabilities and even
crises. Yet this needs to be seen not so much in terms of the old
structural crisis tendencies and their outcomes, but as quotidian
dimensions of contemporary capitalism&#8217;s functioning and indeed, as
we argued above, even of its successes (<strong>GCAE</strong>, p.&nbsp;61).</p>

<p class="fst">Well, I think the problem is a bit more than &#8216;systemic
complexity&#8217;. Let me take three steps towards identifying what&#8217;s
wrong with Panitch and Gindin&#8217;s argument. First of all, their
adherence &#8211; identified as (2) above &#8211; to a supply-side theory of
crisis is a crucial move. What such a theory does is to render the
movements of the capitalist economy dependent on those of the class
struggle. Hence, once the balance of class forces had shifted back in
favour of capital &#8211; as it did, not just in the US but throughout
advanced capitalism between 1975 and 1985 &#8211; the ineluctable
consequence was a recovery in profitability and an end to crisis.
This differentiates Panitch and Gindin from those, such as Brenner
and Harvey, who argue (correctly, in my view) that global capitalism
continues to suffer from the crisis of profitability and
over-accumulation that first exploded in the mid-1970s.</p>

<p>Panitch and Gindin criticise &#8216;traditional Marxist theories of
structural crises&#8217; because &#8216;they sometimes tend to fetishise
crises in the sense of abstracting them from history&#8217;. They
elaborate their own alternative approach thus:</p>

<p class="quoteb">This does not mean that it is no longer useful to speak
of contradictions inherent in capitalism, but we must be careful not
to make too much of their consequences unless they take the form of
class contradictions that raise challenges to capital (in terms of
whether it can adapt or respond) and labour (in terms of whether it
can develop the political capacity to build on the openings
provided). We must dispense with a notion of &#8216;crisis&#8217; as
something that leads capitalism to unravel on its own; our theories
of crisis must be politicised to integrate the responses of both
states and class actors. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This passage is a strange mixture of truism, implied caricature,
and potential error. Truism: of course, capitalism won&#8217;t &#8216;unravel
on its own&#8217;. But &#8211; whatever might or might not have been true in
the past &#8211; name a serious contemporary Marxist political economist
who thinks otherwise (the implication that such exist is the
caricature). Potential error: yes, of course, we should &#8216;integrate
the responses of both states and class actors&#8217;. But for Panitch and
Gindin &#8216;states and class actors&#8217; don&#8217;t just react to booms and
crises, they make them. Supply-side theories of crises are
agent-centred, since they explain the business cycle in terms of the
relative capacities for self-organisation of collective class actors.
By contrast, both the theory of crisis that Marx developed in
<strong>Capital</strong>, volume III, and the modified theory recently put
forward by Brenner explain crises of over-accumulation by a
structural tendency towards a falling rate of profit that cannot be
altered by acts of collective will on the part of the contending
classes &#8211; though of course how classes respond to the effects of
this tendency is crucial in shaping the resolution of crises. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>In my view, Panitch and Gindin are mistaken both in holding to an
over-politicised theory of crisis and in asserting that global
capitalism in general, and the US in particular, have overcome the
crisis of profitability that developed in the 1970s. I don&#8217;t have
the time or space to argue this here: Brenner has done so elsewhere
in a response to a paper by one of Panitch and Gindin&#8217;s
co-thinkers. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> The work of Brenner, Harvey and other Marxist
political economists such as Gérard Duménil and Fred Moseley
provides plentiful evidence to refute Panitch and Gindin&#8217;s
assertions. If these arguments are correct, the implications are very
serious for Panitch and Gindin. Their narrative of post-war
capitalism gives primacy to a single actor &#8211; the American state &#8211;
that is able to shape and then reshape the world as its informal
empire relatively unconstrained &#8211; both because of its power
relative to other actors and because of the power of states and
capitalist classes collectively to determine the fate of the world
economy. But if tendencies to boom and crisis are the consequence of
structural realities &#8211; in particular, relatively decentralised and
anarchic competition among capitals &#8211; that are not easily amenable
to collective interventions even by the most powerful capitalist
states, then these states, the US included, are much more constrained
in their actions than Panitch and Gindin are prepared to concede.
Here it would be useful to compare their work with that of Harvey,
who in The New Imperialism seeks to integrate the geopolitical
strategy of the US under George W. Bush with the continuing effects
of what Brenner calls &#8216;the long downturn&#8217; (indeed, Harvey&#8217;s
major theorisation of Marxist political economy in <strong>The Limits to
Capital</strong> [1982] already concluded with a discussion of
contemporary inter-imperialist rivalries).</p>

<p>Secondly, Panich and Gindin insist on giving proper weight to the
state as a relatively autonomous actor. Thus they write, &#8216;Those who
interpreted Japan&#8217;s trade penetration of American markets and its
massive direct foreign investments in the US through the 1980s in
terms of inter-imperial rivalry betrayed a misleadingly economistic
perspective&#8217; (<strong>GCAE</strong>, p.&nbsp;59). Insofar as remarks of this
kind imply a rejection of instrumentalist conceptions of the state
that treat it as a mere tool in the hands of big business, the point
is well taken. But, once again, it is hardly news. Marxists have over
the past few decades sought to develop theorisations of the state
that give proper weight to its role as an independent actor. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a>
Moreover, this kind of understanding informs the main contemporary
versions of the classical Marxist theory of imperialism. Harvey, as
the passage cited at the start of this paper makes very clear,
conceives the relationship between the logics of territorial and
capitalist power as a dialectical one in which the two potentially
contradict one another. Similarly, I conceptualise imperialism as the
intersection of economic and geopolitical competition in part
precisely to avoid the suggestion that the latter is an epiphenomenon
of the former. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a> Panitch and Gindin might object that in setting
the development of capitalist imperialism in the context of the
structurally determined crisis-tendencies of the capitalist mode of
production Harvey and I are giving ultimate primacy to the economy,
but if economic primacy doesn&#8217;t figure somewhere in the argument
what is the point of calling oneself a Marxist?</p>

<p>Thirdly and finally, what about Panitch and Gindin&#8217;s substantive
interpretation of contemporary imperialism as the relatively stable
and expanded reproduction of the informal American empire? Here
again, there is an important element of truth to their argument. It
is undeniable that there is an asymmetrical relationship between the
US and even the most powerful of the other advanced capitalisms &#8211;
Japan, Germany, Britain, France, etc. Moreover, Panitch and Gindin&#8217;s
critique of the idea that interimperialist rivalries persist is a
useful corrective to the mistaken claim that, for example, I made in
earlier writings that the end of the Cold War would see a return to
the fluid and potentially disastrous economic and geopolitical
competition among the Great Powers that prevailed during the era of
classical imperialism between 1870 and 1945. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a> In retrospect, this
claim confused two levels of determination. It is inherent in the
nature of imperialism that it involves economic and geopolitical
competition among a plurality of major capitalist states. But it does
not follow that this competition must necessarily take the form of
conflict, ultimately military, among a relatively small number of
roughly equal Great Powers or coalitions of Great Powers &#8211; as it
did in the lead-up to both the First and Second World Wars. Moreover,
the idea of a return to the Great Power rivalries of 1870&#8211; 1945,
while (as I argue below) containing an important element of truth,
stated baldly implied a simple repetition of earlier historical
patterns without taking into account the effects of the concrete
forms taken by economic and geopolitical competition in the
intervening Cold War era.</p>

<p>Thus the historic achievement of the American state during the
1940s was the construction of a transnational economic and
geopolitical space that unified the entire advanced capitalist world
under US leadership: much of the material that Panitch and Gindin
cite documents this process. One consequence of this arrangement was
that capital and commodities flowed with growing freedom within this
space, to the benefit, again as Panitch and Gindin show, of US banks
and transnational corporations. Another was what I have called the
partial dissociation of economic and geopolitical competition: in
other words, as a result of the integration of advanced capitalism
into a single &#8216;Western&#8217; geopolitical and ideological bloc,
economic rivalries among capitals did not have the same potential to
become military confrontations as they had had in the earlier era of
classical imperialism, when Germany emerged as both an industrial and
naval challenger to British hegemony.</p>

<p>Panitch and Gindin are right to see this achievement as a result
of the pursuit of a conscious grand strategy by the American ruling
class, as numerous studies have confirmed. But they are
insufficiently sensitive to the strains to which it has been
increasingly subjected as a result of two overlapping processes. The
first is the impact of the long-term structural crisis of
profitability and over-accumulation, itself to a significant extent a
consequence of the emergence from the 1960s onwards of Japan and
Germany as major economic competitors to the US. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> The second is
the development of centrifugal tendencies within the Western
geopolitical bloc. While of long standing (and indeed partially
related to the first process), these tendencies were reinforced by
the collapse of the Cold War partition of the world in 1989&#8211;91,
which removed the most obvious rationale for the system of alliances
that had knitted together advanced capitalism under US hegemony. The
fact that, instead of disintegrating after the Cold War, the
transnational economic and geopolitical space constructed in the
1940s became genuinely global was in no sense inevitable. Its
extension was a result of the creative political intervention of the
American state, particularly under the Clinton administration, for
example, to take advantage of the Balkan Wars to force through NATO
and EU expansion on terms that preserved and indeed extended the role
of the US as the leading military and political power in Eurasia, and
to reinforce the role of the Bretton Woods institutions as enforcers
of the neo-liberal Washington Consensus on terms favourable to the
Anglo-American model of free-market capitalism. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>But the fact that the US-dominated space did not fragment does not
mean that serious tensions do not exist within it, or that
maintaining it intact does not require continuing and contested
effort on the part of the American state. The crisis over Iraq
brought all this into dramatic focus. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a> Panitch and Gindin&#8217;s
discussion of Iraq is one of the least convincing aspects of their
overall argument. According to them the war was a case of the more
general problem posed to the American empire by &#8216;rogue&#8217; and
&#8216;failed&#8217; states, and the divisions between the US and Britain, on
the one hand, and France and Germany, on the other, &#8216;pertain very
little to economic &#8220;rivalries&#8221;,&#8217; reflecting rather the latter
states&#8217; preference for multilateral forms of intervention (<strong>GCAE</strong>, p.&nbsp;73).</p>

<p>The difficulty with this line of argument is that it says nothing
at all about the strategic thinking behind the Iraq war. Yet if one
consults the key documents that reflect the outlook of the
neoconservatives apparently exerting a growing influence on US global
policy under Bush father and son &#8211; the draft <em>Defense Planning
Guidance</em> of March 1992, the material produced by the Project for
the New American Century under Clinton, and <em>The National Security
Strategy of the United States of America</em> of September 2002 &#8211;
running through of all these is precisely what should not exist,
according to Panitch and Gindin, namely a preoccupation with
preventing the emergence of &#8216;peer competitors&#8217; to the US. Let a
quotation from the last of these texts suffice: &#8216;Our forces will be
strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a
military build-up in the hopes of surpassing, or equalling, the power
of the United States&#8217;. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, it is important to understand that, whatever is
eccentric, aberrant, or disputed about the neocon worldview relative
to the broader US national security elite, it is not this concern
with addressing the problem of potential peer competitors. If one
takes the work of policy intellectuals other than the
neoconservatives and in some cases hostile to them or at least
critical of the Iraq adventure &#8211; for example, Henry Kissinger,
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Philip Bobbitt, Joseph Nye and John Mearsheimer,
one finds the same preoccupation with the future of US hegemony in
the face of a variety of powers that can be expected to challenge it
at least at the regional level. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p>Now, Marx famously said that if essence and appearance coincided
then science would be superfluous. All these weighty strategic
analyses could be so much epiphenomenal fluff, beneath which lies the
reality of a secure and invincible American empire. Personally I find
it more economical, however, to take this material at face value, and
to treat it as evidence of the very long-standing preoccupation of US
grand strategy to prevent the emergence of a hostile Great Power or
coalition on the Eurasian landmass. This then supports the
interpretation of the Iraq war offered by both Harvey and myself,
namely that seizing Iraq would not simply remove a regime long
obnoxious to the US, but would both serve as a warning to all states
of the costs of defying American military power and, by entrenching
this power in the Middle East, give Washington control of what Harvey
calls &#8216;the global oil spigot&#8217; on which potential challengers in
Europe and East Asia are particularly dependent. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p>Not simply was the conquest of Iraq thus a pre-emptive strike by
the US, less against Saddam Hussein than against the other leading
powers, but the unfolding of the crisis made the tensions within the
Western bloc dramatically visible. The first months of 2003 were
remarkable ones in the history of the transatlantic alliance, with
France, Germany and Belgium blocking the use of NATO assets for the
invasion of Iraq, and Washington mobilising the EU accession states
in East and Central Europe against &#8216;Old Europe&#8217;. Of course,
considerable efforts have been made since the fall of Baghdad, and
particularly since Bush&#8217;s re-election, to heal the wounds between
the US and the leading continental European states, but there are
definite limits. On the one hand, the administration has if anything
strengthened its rhetorical commitment to spreading democracy by the
sword. On the other, despite regular predictions to the contrary by
Washington, London and a significant section of the Marxist left,
France and Germany continue to resist American pressure to
participate in the occupation of Iraq. The trend is rather in the
opposite direction, as various &#8216;New European&#8217; states that sent
troops to Iraq fall over each other rushing for the exit.</p>

<p>Behind this lies, of course, the failure of the occupation itself.
Despite numerous announcements of a new dawn, most recently at the
elections in January 2005, the US is confronted with the opposition
of a large majority of the Iraqi people to its presence, and with the
armed resistance of a determined and well-rooted minority. The result
has been a signal lesson in the limits of even American military
might &#8211; overwhelming superiority in fire power doesn&#8217;t confer
control over a large, dispersed, and predominantly hostile
population. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a> Panitch and Gindin indeed see the Iraq crisis
highlighting &#8216;the danger posed to the broader legitimacy of the
other capitalist states now that they are located in a framework of
American imperialism that is so unconcealed&#8217; (<strong>GCAE</strong>, p.&nbsp;73).
Giovanni Arrighi goes much further, suggesting that, &#8216;while its
difficulties in Vietnam precipitated the &#8220;signal crisis&#8221; of US
hegemony, in retrospect US difficulties in Iraq will be seen as
having precipitated its &#8220;terminal crisis&#8221;,&#8217; marking the
transition to &#8216;dominance without hegemony&#8217;, where US global
pre-eminence comes to rest on military might alone, losing the
consent of other capitalist classes who had seen it as in their
interest as well. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p>Even if Arrighi is right to suggest that US hegemony is
&#8216;unravelling&#8217;, it is important to state the implications with
care. Let us return to the issue of inter-imperialist rivalries.
Claude Serfati has given a good account of why, in his view, &#8216;there
is no chance that the inter-capitalist economic rivalries among
countries of the transatlantic zone will break out into military
confrontations&#8217;. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> The reasons he gives are both positive and
negative. Negatively, the military gap between the US and all other
states singly and combined is so great as to create very strong
&#8216;threshhold effects&#8217; impeding any state (or, more realistically,
block of states, such as the EU) from developing military
capabilities comparable to the US. Positively, the extent of the
interdependence among the leading capitalist economies gives them
strong incentives to cooperate and means that US hegemony is the
source of &#8216;public goods&#8217; that benefit them all.</p>

<p>All of this is fair enough, and one can add other specific reasons
why economic competition within the Western bloc need not translate
into military conflict. Transatlantic tensions reached their height
when, in the early months of 2003, the Bush administration apparently
embraced a policy, not (as had traditionally been US strategy) of
encouraging further European integration, but of divide and rule.
This shift gave France and Germany a strong incentive to develop
greater autonomy from the US &#8211; but it also made this harder to
achieve, given the existence of a bloc of EU states more closely
aligned with Washington and led by Britain, whose cooperation would
be essential to any serious attempt to enhance European military
capabilities. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a> The defeat of the European Constitution in the
French and Dutch referendums of May 2005 has reignited the conflict
between &#8216;New&#8217; and &#8216;Old&#8217; Europe, this time over domestic
economic policy, as the former, under the leadership of a
reinvigorated Tony Blair, presses for more rapid neo-liberal
&#8216;reforms&#8217;. All the same, it would be foolish to ignore the
emergence of what Serfati himself describes as the
&#8216;alter-imperialism&#8217; of the EU and the increasing effort that, as
he shows, is being put into developing the European Security and
Defence Policy. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, it would be a mistake to underestimate the reality and
the destabilising potential of conflicts among the advanced
capitalist states. Economic rivalries among transnational
corporations whose investments and markets are concentrated in one of
the three points of the G7 triad &#8211; North America, Western Europe
and Japan &#8211; and that rely on state support in their competitive
struggles remain a structural feature of the contemporary global
political economy. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a> An obvious example is provided by the endemic
and serious tensions between the US and the EU over trade: the
current dispute over state subsidies to, respectively, Boeing and
Airbus seems especially bitter and hard to resolve. Moreover, in
Latin America the role that the US has played in promoting
neo-liberal policies that open up previously relatively protected
markets to foreign capital had, according to Paul Cammack, the ironic
effect of benefiting primarily European transnationals rather than
American capitalism, despite the latter&#8217;s putative dominance of the
region. This case illustrates how the activities of the US to provide
&#8216;public goods&#8217; to the benefit of the advanced capitalisms
generally may be to the disadvantage of American capitalism in
particular. Like all human phenomena, US imperialism is subject to
the law of unintended consequences. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a></p>

<p>But perhaps the most serious transatlantic row since the invasion
of Iraq has been over EU plans to end the arms embargo imposed on
China after the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989. American
politicians and commentators have tended to portray the affair as a
case of parochial, money-obsessed Europeans failing to see the bigger
geopolitical picture. This doesn&#8217;t seem right at all: no doubt
concern to get better access to what has become the powerhouse of the
world economy was an important reason behind the proposed policy
change. But the aim of the French president, Jacques Chirac, seems to
have been straightforwardly geopolitical &#8211; to find in the rising
power of China a counter-weight to American hegemony. A recent CIA
assessment went even further, predicting: &#8216;An EU-China alliance,
though still unlikely, is not unthinkable&#8217;. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>An even more striking feature of the row over lifting the arms
embargo (a decision has now been postponed under intense US pressure)
was that American critics of the policy openly objected on the
grounds that a war between the US and China, &#8216;though still
unlikely, is [also] not unthinkable&#8217;. Nor was this said simply by
members of the Taiwan lobby or bug-eyed Republican China-bashers.
Michael O&#8217;Hanlon of the eminently sane and middle of the road
Brookings Institution wrote recently, &#8216;There really is a chance of
a Sino-US war over Taiwan, which may ebb and flow month to month but
nonetheless remains quite real. And any European decision to lift the
embargo could make any war more likely and more costly in lives and
assets&#8217;. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a></p>

<p>Remarks of this nature rather put into perspective any predictions
that the future course of capitalist development will be pacific.
Panitch and Gindin do acknowledge the possibility that China may come
to constitute a counter-example to their general analysis:</p>

<p class="quoteb">China may perhaps emerge eventually as a pole of
inter-imperial power, but it will obviously remain very far from
reaching such a status for a good many decades. The fact that certain
elements in the American states are concerned to ensure that its
&#8216;unipolar&#8217; power today is used to prevent the possible emergence
of imperial rivals tomorrow can hardly be used as evidence that such
rivals already exist (<strong>GCAE</strong>, pp.&nbsp;59&#8211;60).</p>

<p class="fst">This polarisation of present and future seriously underestimates
the fluidity of contemporary geopolitics. The row over the lifting of
the European arms embargo hardly suggests that the military threat
from China is seen as being &#8216;a good many decades&#8217; away &#8211; a
series of senior US national security officials from Porter Goss, the
Director of Central Intelligence, down have in the past few months
been warning of the strategic threat represented by China and in
particular of Beijing&#8217;s rapid modernisation of its naval and air
forces. The <strong>Financial Times</strong> reports: &#8216;Policymakers in
Washington are questioning the assumption that a Chinese challenge to
US military domination of the Asia-Pacific region lies decades in the
future&#8217;. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a> The Pentagon&#8217;s annual report on the Chinese
military is a compromise document, on the one hand affirming that the
People&#8217;s Liberation Army&#8217;s current ability to &#8216;project
conventional military power beyond its periphery remains limited&#8217;,
on the other hand warning that, &#8216;over the longer term, if current
trends persist, PLA capabilities could pose a credible threat to
other modern militaries operating in the region&#8217;. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> Even if such
fears are overstated (the CIA is hardly the most credible of
intelligence sources after 9/11 and the non-existent Iraqi WMD),
there is always the danger that steps taken by the US to prevent
China from becoming a threat may simply give the latter&#8217;s rulers a
greater incentive to build up their military capabilities quickly.</p>

<p>Panitch and Gindin are also dismissive of the increasingly
important role played by the central banks of China and other East
Asian states in financing the US fiscal and trade deficits: &#8216;To
suggest, as Arrighi does, that because the holders of American
Treasury bills are now primarily in Asia we are therefore witnessing
a shift in the regional balance of power, is to confuse the
distribution of assets with the distribution of power&#8217;. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a> Here
distinctions need to be made with more care than they do. In the
first place, it is undoubtedly a sign of the economic and political
strength of American capitalism &#8211; and, in particular, of the
comparative advantage it gains from being able freely to issue,
without any backing in gold or whatever, the world&#8217;s main reserve
currency and thus to create new means of payment &#8211; that it has been
able to finance the deficit through a massive inflow of capital from
the rest of the world. But it doesn&#8217;t follow that we should
subscribe to the theory affirmed by Vice-President Dick Cheney when
he told the then US Treasury secretary, Paul O&#8217; Neill, &#8216;Reagan
proved that deficits don&#8217;t matter&#8217;. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p>The Cheney theory implies that the US could easily continue a
trade deficit that, on current trends, will rise from 6 percent to 10
percent of GDP by the start of the next decade. It would be easier to
believe that it could if the inflow of capital financing the deficit
were attracted by higher profits than are obtainable elsewhere: but,
in fact, to judge by the fact that American corporations receive
higher returns on their foreign direct investments than they do from
their assets within the US, the reverse is true. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a> No doubt the US
has other economic attractions than sheer profitability &#8211; the
security and mobility of capital, for example. But the role, already
noted, that Asian central banks now play in financing the deficit
highlights the role of more political or more political-economic
considerations in this policy &#8211; for example, avoiding the
dependence on foreign capital that had such a devastating impact
during the crisis of 1997&#8211;98 and keeping Asian currencies at a
competitive level against the dollar and thereby permitting the
maintenance of the high-export economic model on which East Asian
capitalism is based. In this context, there was an element of playing
with fire in the recent campaign in the US and the EU for renminbi
revaluation. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p>From a broader historical perspective, it seems simply perverse to
deny any broader economic and geopolitical significance to the role
played by China in particular and East Asian capitalism in general in
financing the US deficit. Arrighi&#8217;s analysis of the crisis of US
hegemony is set against the background of a much broader cyclical
theory of history in which capitalist powers win and lose hegemony
according to a definite and fixed pattern. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a> One doesn&#8217;t have to
sign up to this kind of theory to recognise that it was a significant
historical moment when Britain became financially indebted to the
United States during the First World War, even if it took another 30
years for this to be translated into the definitive displacement of
one by the other as the leading capitalist power. Even if one
discounts any such displacement of the US by China, the profound
tensions being concentrated in East Asia cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>The Chinese boom has played an important role in reorienting the
global political economy, as China has become a major supplier of
cheap manufactured goods to the US and the rest of the advanced
capitalist world, as well as a key purchaser of intermediate goods
from Japan, South Korea and the EU, and of raw materials from the
Middle East, Latin America and Africa. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a> Moreover, as we have
already seen, China and the other East Asian states now closely bound
up economically with it have become the underwriters of the continued
expansion of American capitalism. Simultaneously China has also
become a lightning-rod for geopolitical tensions, has supplanted
Japan as the main object of protectionist agitation in the US, and
has been identified by the Pentagon and the CIA as the Great Power
with which America is most likely to go to war. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a></p>

<p>The contradictions that are now concentrated in China are thus
symptomatic of the current state of the global political economy &#8211;
of, not the stable incorporation of world capitalism within the
American informal empire, but the fragility of the global
accumulation process and of geopolitics today. We must hope &#8211; and
act to ensure &#8211; that this fragility does not make itself felt in
too brutal and destructive a way.</p>

China&#8217;s decision in July 2005 to revalue the renminbi by 2.1
percent and allow it to fluctuate mildly against a basket of
currencies is unlikely to eliminate these pressures.</p>

Modern World System</strong> (Minneapolis 1999); and G. Arrighi, <em>Hegemony
Unravelling, II</em>, <strong>New Left Review (II)&nbsp;33</strong> (2005).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f41" name="n41">41.</a> Martin Hart-Landsberg and Paul Burkett give an excellent
analysis of China&#8217;s place in the world economy in <em>China and the
Dynamics of Transnational Capital Accumulation</em>, paper for the
conference on <em>Korean Economy: Marxist Perspectives</em>, as above.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f42" name="n42">42.</a> The case of Japan underlines the importance of not reducing
geopolitical to economic relations. Japan&#8217;s uneasy recovery from
the long slump of the 1990s has depended critically on feeding the
Chinese boom, but the Koizumi government&#8217;s aggressive nationalist
stance (symbolised by the conflicts over Japan&#8217;s war record) has
involved sending troops to Iraq and, more significantly, aligning
itself with Washington&#8217;s strategy of militarily containing China:
see, for example, G. McCormack, <em>Remilitarising Japan</em>, <strong>New
Left Review (II)&nbsp;29</strong> (2004). Japan&#8217;s close geopolitical
alignment with the US might seem to confirm Panitch&#8217;s and Gindin&#8217;s
analysis, but the long-term effect is likely to be to stoke up the
tensions that they underplay.</p>
