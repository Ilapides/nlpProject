<h3 class="western">John Holloway:</h3>

<p class="fst">I don&#8217;t know the answer. Perhaps we can change the world without
taking power. Perhaps we cannot. The starting point &#8211; for all of
us, I think &#8211; is uncertainty, not knowing, a common search for a
way forward. Because it becomes more and more clear that capitalism
is a catastrophe for humanity. A radical change in the organisation
of society, that is, revolution, is more urgent than ever. And this
revolution can only be world revolution if it is to be effective.</p>
<p>But it is unlikely that world revolution can be achieved in one
single blow. This means that the only way in which we can conceive of
revolution is as interstitial revolution, as a revolution that takes
place in the interstices of capitalism, a revolution that occupies
spaces in the world while capitalism still exists. The question is
how we conceive of these interstices, whether we think of them as
states or in other ways.</p>

<p>In thinking about this, we have to start from where we are, from
the many rebellions and insubordinations that have brought us to
Porto Alegre. The world is full of such rebellions, of people saying
NO to capitalism: NO, we shall not live our lives according to the
dictates of capitalism, we shall do what we consider necessary or
desirable and not what capital tells us to do. Sometimes we just see
capitalism as an all-encompassing system of domination and forget
that such rebellions exist everywhere. At times they are so small
that even those involved do not perceive them as refusals, but often
they are collective projects searching for an alternative way forward
and sometimes they are as big as the Lacandon Jungle or the
Argentinazo of three years ago or the revolt in Bolivia just over a
year ago. All of these insubordinations are characterised by a drive
towards self-determination, an impulse that says, &#8216;No, you will not
tell us what to do, we shall decide for ourselves what we must do.&#8217;</p>

<p>These refusals can be seen as fissures, as cracks in the system of
capitalist domination. Capitalism is not (in the first place) an
economic system, but a system of command. Capitalists, through money,
command us, telling us what to do. To refuse to obey is to break the
command of capital. The question for us, then, is how do we multiply
and expand these refusals, these cracks in the texture of domination?</p>

<p>There are two ways of thinking about this.</p>

<p>The first says that these movements, these many insubordinations,
lack maturity and effectiveness unless they are focused, unless they
are channelled towards a goal. For them to be effective, they must be
channelled towards the conquest of state power &#8211; either through
elections or through the overthrowing of the existing state and the
establishment of a new, revolutionary state. The organisational form
for channelling all these insubordinations towards that aim is the party.</p>

<p>The question of taking state power is not so much a question of
future intentions as of present organisation. How should we organise
ourselves in the present? Should we join a party, an organisational
form that focuses our discontent on the winning of state power? Or
should we organise in some other way?</p>

<p>The second way of thinking about the expansion and multiplication
of insubordinations is to say, &#8216;No, they should not be all
harnessed together in the form of a party, they should flourish
freely, go whatever way the struggle takes them.&#8217; This does not
mean that there should be no coordination, but it should be a much
looser coordination. Above all, the principal point of reference is
not the state but the society that we want to create.</p>

<p>The principal argument against the first conception is that it
leads us in the wrong direction. The state is not a thing, it is not
a neutral object: it is a form of social relations, a form of
organisation, a way of doing things which has been developed over
several centuries for the purpose of maintaining or developing the
rule of capital. If we focus our struggles on the state, or if we
take the state as our principal point of reference, we have to
understand that the state pulls us in a certain direction. Above all,
it seeks to impose upon us a separation of our struggles from
society, to convert our struggle into a struggle on behalf of, in the
name of. It separates leaders from the masses, the representatives
from the represented; it draws us into a different way of talking, a
different way of thinking. It pulls us into a process of
reconciliation with reality, and that reality is the reality of
capitalism, a form of social organisation that is based on
exploitation and injustice, on killing and destruction. It also draws
us into a spatial definition of how we do things, a spatial
definition which makes a clear distinction between the state&#8217;s
territory and the world outside, and a clear distinction between
citizens and foreigners. It draws us into a spatial definition of
struggle that has no hope of matching the global movement of capital.</p>

<p>There is one key concept in the history of the state-centred left,
and that concept is betrayal. Time and time again the leaders have
betrayed the movement, and not necessarily because they are bad
people, but just because the state as a form of organisation
separates the leaders from the movement and draws them into a process
of reconciliation with capital. Betrayal is already given in the
state as an organisational form.</p>

<p>Can we resist this? Yes, of course we can, and it is something
that happens all the time. We can refuse to let the state identify
leaders or permanent representatives of the movement, we can refuse
to let delegates negotiate in secret with the representatives of the
state. But this means understanding that our forms of organisation
are very different from those of the state, that there is no symmetry
between them. The state is an organisation on behalf of, what we want
is the organisation of self-determination, a form of organisation
that allows us to articulate what we want, what we decide, what we
consider necessary or desirable. What we want, in other words, is a
form of organisation that does not have the state as its principal
point of reference.</p>

<p>The argument against taking the state as the principal point of
reference is clear, but what of the other concept? The state-oriented
argument can be seen as a pivoted conception of the development of
struggle. Struggle is conceived as having a central pivot, the taking
of state power. First we concentrate all our efforts on winning the
state, we organise for that, then, once we have achieved that, we can
think of other forms of organisation, we can think of revolutionising
society. First we move in one direction, in order to be able to move
in another: the problem is that the dynamic acquired during the first
phase is difficult or impossible to dismantle in the second phase.</p>

<p>The other concept focuses directly on the sort of society we want
to create, without passing through the state. There is no pivot:
organisation is directly prefigurative, directly linked to the social
relations we want to create. Where the first concept sees the radical
transformation of society as taking place after the seizure of power,
the second insists that it must begin now. Revolution not when the
time is right but revolution here and now.</p>

<p>This prefiguration, this revolution here-and-now is above all the
drive to self-determination. Self-determination cannot exist in a
capitalist society. What can and does exist is the drive towards
social self-determination: the moving against alien determination,
determination by others. Such a moving against determination by
others is necessarily experimental, but three things are clear:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>The drive towards self-determination is necessarily a drive
against allowing others to decide on our behalf. It is therefore a
movement against representative democracy and for the creation of
some form of direct democracy.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The drive towards self-determination is incompatible with
the state, which is a form of organisation which decides on our
behalf and thereby excludes us.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The drive towards self-determination makes no sense unless
it includes as its central point the self-determination of our work,
our activity. It is necessarily directed against the capitalist
organisation of work. We are talking, therefore, not just of
democracy but of communism, not just of rebellion but of revolution.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">For me, it is this second conception of revolution that we have to
concentrate on. The fact that we reject the state-centred conception
doesn&#8217;t obviously mean that the non-state-centred conception does
not have its problems. I see three principal problems, none of which
is an argument for reverting to the idea of taking state power:</p>
<p>The first issue is how to deal with state repression. I do not
think the answer is to arm ourselves so that we can defeat the state
in open confrontation: we would be unlikely to win, and anyway it
would involve reproducing precisely the authoritarian social
relations we are fighting against. Nor do I think that the answer is
to take control of the state so that we can control the army and the
police forces: the use of the army and police on behalf of the people
obviously comes into conflict with the struggles of those who do not
want anyone to act on their behalf. This leaves us with trying to
find other ways of dissuading the state from exercising violence
against us: this may have to involve some degree of armed resistance
(as in the case of the Zapatistas), but must surely rely above all on
the strength of the integration of the rebellion into the community.</p>

<p>The second issue is whether we can develop alternative doings
(alternative productive activity) within capitalism, and to what
extent we can create an alternative social nexus between activities,
other than value. There are many experiments that point in the
direction of some sort of solution (the <i>f&#225;bricas recuperadas</i>,
factories reopened by the workers, in Argentina, for example) and the
possibilities will obviously depend on the scale of the movement
itself, but this remains a major problem. How do we think of a social
determination of production and distribution that moves from the
bottom up (from the interstitial revolts) rather than from a central
planning body?</p>

<p>The third issue is the organisation of social self-determination.
How do we organise a system of direct democracy on a scale that goes
beyond the local level in a complex society? The classic answer is
the idea of councils linked by a council of councils to which the
councils send instantly recallable delegates. This seems basically
correct, but it is clear that even in small groups the operation of
democracy is always problematic, so that the only way in which direct
democracy can be conceived is as a constant process of
experimentation and self-education.</p>

<p>Can we change the world without taking power? The only way to find
out is to do it.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h3 class="western">Alex Callinicos:</h3>

<p class="fst">Whatever our differences, John and I stand for changing the world
through a process of self-emancipation, where there aren&#8217;t leaders
who tell people what to do but rather people who collectively
liberate themselves. I admire the honesty, clarity and consistency of
John&#8217;s work, which is evident in his presentation today. But I also
have to be honest and say that I find the ideal of changing the world
without taking power ultimately self-refuting.</p>

<p>I agree with John about uncertainty. There are lots of things we
cannot know. But one thing I am certain about. That is that it is
impossible to change the world without addressing and solving the
question of political power.</p>

<p>I absolutely sympathise with one of the impulses behind the slogan
&#8216;Change the world without taking power&#8217;. Among a lot of the
traditions on the left worldwide there has been what has been called
&#8216;socialism from above&#8217;. Whether it is a Communist party with
Stalinist traditions or a social democratic party like the Workers
Party in Brazil today, it involves the idea that the party changes
things for you and everyone else remains passive.</p>

<p>The political tradition I stand in is a very different one. It is
that of socialism from below summed up in Marx&#8217;s definition of
socialism as the self-emancipation of the working class. Socialism is
about the oppressed and exploited of the world effectively liberating themselves.</p>

<p>My fundamental difference with John is that I believe this process
of self-emancipation requires us to confront and overthrow the
existing state and replacing it with a radically different form of
state power.</p>

<p>John invites us essentially to turn our backs on the state. He
says that we should carry out what he calls an &#8216;interstitial&#8217;
revolution. It&#8217;s been summed up by other thinkers sharing the same
ideas as John as life despite capitalism. We should all try and
cultivate our autonomous gardens despite the horrors of capitalism.</p>

<p>The trouble is that the state won&#8217;t leave us alone and that is
because capitalism itself, the system that different states sustain,
won&#8217;t leave us alone. Capitalism today is invading the gardens of
the world to carve them up and turn them into branches of
agribusiness or suburban speculation and won&#8217;t leave us alone.</p>

<p>We cannot ignore the state, because the state is the most
concentrated single form of capitalist power. This means
strategically we have to be against the state, to pursue the
revolution against the state.</p>

<p>Does this mean we ignore the existing state and do not ever put
demands on the capitalist state? No. The existing capitalist states
try to legitimise themselves to win the consent of those they oppress
and exploit. This means that if we organise effectively, we can force
reforms out of capitalism. Also, if we ignore the state, that means
we will be indifferent to struggles over privatisation. For example,
at the minute George Bush wants to privatise the pensions system in
the US. Do we say we don&#8217;t care about that because the social
security system in the US is organised by the state? I think, no.</p>

<p>Finally, many workers these days are employed by the state. Part
of the process of privatisation means those employees of private
companies replace these workers. Often that means the service to the
public is worse and the conditions and wages of those employed by
those companies get worse.</p>

<p>But if we are not indifferent to the state, that does not mean we
can rely on it. In the long run capitalism and the state which seeks
to sustain it will seek to take back any reforms it concedes
temporarily. That is what they are seeking to do at the present time.</p>

<p>Moreover, as John has highlighted, the state is a hierarchical
organisation which organises violence to keep the mass of society subordinated.</p>

<p>This means we cannot simply try to seize the existing state. If we
seize the existing state, in the end, at the worst we will get
Stalin, at best we will get someone like Lula or Mbeki in South
Africa who comes out of a mass movement which seeks to change the
world but ends up administering things for capitalism.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the alternative then? It is to build up a movement that
is powerful and focused enough to break the existing forms of state
power and institute radically different and radically democratic
forms of state power. In other words, there has to be a revolution
which is not a party taking state power by seizing the existing
state, but the oppressed and exploited &#8211; above all workers &#8211; who
break the existing state and in the process of doing so create
radically new and democratic forms of power in order to manage
society for themselves.</p>

<p>This alternative is not just a fantasy that I&#8217;ve spun out of my
head. If we look at the history of the working class movement over
the last 150 years, again and again workers have created new ways of
organising in order to wage mass struggles effectively. These have
been much more democratic, much more subject to the control of the
workers themselves. In order to wage their struggles, they have
created delegate structures that break down the hierarchy that John
talks about. And in doing so they have created new forms of political
power, even if they don&#8217;t know it.</p>

<p>There are many examples: the soviets in the Russian revolutions of
1905 and 1917 are the most famous examples; there were the workers&#8217;
and soldiers&#8217; councils that were formed in the German Revolution of
1918&#8211;20; right up to the <i>cordones</i> that were formed in Chile
in 1972&#8211;73 at the height of the struggles under the Popular Unity
government of Allende. There are many other examples of mass popular
organisation that represent a new sort of political power.</p>

<p>The important thing about these forms of organisation, whatever
the intentions that led to their formation, is that they have the
capacity to challenge and break the existing state and institute new
forms of power.</p>

<p>We are not saying, as John was suggesting, &#8216;Wait for the
revolution.&#8217; But any struggles that begin to build towards
self-organisation are pointing the way towards the way a future
non-capitalist, socialist, society can be organised. The problem is
that for any movement towards self-organisation to succeed in
breaking the power of capital, there has to be a moment of
concentration and centralisation. You can&#8217;t deal with the
concentrated power of capital &#8211; the state and the multinational
corporations &#8211; without the movements themselves becoming focused to
confront the power of those corporations directly.</p>

<p>John will say, &#8216;When you talk about centralisation and
concentration, you are returning to the old ways of organising, you
are beginning to organise in a way that reproduces the centralised
and hierarchical structures of the existing state.&#8217;</p>

<p>I agree it isn&#8217;t easy. John was very honest and talked about the
difficulties with his strategic conception, and I agree there are
difficulties with the approach I am defending. Combining
centralisation with self-organisation is not easy. But without a
degree of centralisation we will be defeated.</p>

<p>If we simply have fragmented and decentralised and localised
activity, all cultivating our autonomous gardens, capital can isolate
us and destroy or incorporate us piece by piece. And we cannot
address problems like climate change unless we have the capacity to
coordinate and, to a degree, to centralise for global change. We
cannot reduce CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions to the necessary level without global
coordination. We will not achieve the world we want to see if we
simply rely on the fragment and the local.</p>

<p>This is related to the question of parties. John is critical of
the party as a form of organisation. He says it reproduces the
hierarchical structures of the existing state. But if we look at our
movement, there are parties within the movement &#8211; that is, there
are ideologically organised currents which have in their different
ways a total strategic view of the transformation of society. In that
sense of party, John and the people who think like him are as much a
party within the different movements as are the Workers Party and the
PSOL in Brazil <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>, or the Socialist Workers Party in Britain.</p>

<p>My ideal in this respect is the one articulated by the great
Italian revolutionary Antonio Gramsci. He talked about the
dialectical interaction between the moment of centralisation
represented by the parties and the self-organised impulse from the
movement which is the fundamental driving force of revolution.</p>
<p>To sum up: First of all we cannot avoid the question of the state
and political power. It is a delusion to believe we can avoid it. The
critical question is who takes power and how. If it is simply a
question of a party taking control of the existing state by whatever
means, then it is absolutely true that will be a change that simply
reproduces the existing relations of domination. But the conception
of a self-organised working class seizing power to institute new
forms of political organisation and state organisation along with all
the other oppressed and exploited groups changes the question.</p>

<p>Revolution then becomes a process of self-emancipation which
starts here and now, in the way we organise resistance to capitalism,
and culminates when we create a self-organised society, and
capitalism and all the oppression associated with it becomes simply a
bad memory.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h3 class="western">Discussion</h3>

<p class="fst"><b>First contributor from the floor:</b></p>

<p class="fst">I agree mainly with John&#8217;s idea. This discussion is not new. The
same discussion happened in the 19th century. The people who believed
we should focus on taking power in the state won the debate, and they
created movements in that direction. Stalin was one result, Lula
another. Once the state becomes the focus of the fight we cannot
avoid the change becoming just a mirror of the state. The revolution
was not really a revolution for the people.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Second contributor:</b></p>

<p class="fst">We haven&#8217;t looked so far at Venezuela in this debate. There both
sides of the question are being developed. They are looking at the
state while making the internal transformation from below, beginning
with the new constitution which embodies decentralisation and
participation. Economically they are undertaking development, with
agrarian reform, ending landlordism and redistributing land to the
peasantry. Educationally they are ending illiteracy for 3 million
people. By participatory democracy and social inclusion they are
trying to bring about the self-emancipation talked about here.
Venezuela represents a new and quite different way of resolving the
questions we are discussing here. It is achieving levels of
self-organisation that mean it is no longer dependent on the world
system. It is five years since the IMF and World Bank determined what
happened there.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Third contributor:</b></p>

<p class="fst">All over the world we have people creating progressive parties
based on a mishmash of neo-Keynesian policies, reform, reinstituting
regulation and so on. If we advocate revolution here and now,
simultaneously with an attempt to replace the state by the
anti-state, we have to think about what the alternative is going to
be. Capitalism is the indefinite accumulation of capital until the
point where you have the obscenity of money in the hands of so few
that it really amounts to mass destruction. We should add to the
Ch&#225;vez revolution the ideas put out by <b>Z magazine</b> that look back to
Marx&#8217;s idea of a federation of producers and turn it into a
federation of producers and consumers.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Fourth contributor:</b></p>

<p class="fst">I want to ask two questions. One, what is the significance of the
concept of fissure or crack which John uses? The second is whether
there is not some concept of power other than that of state power.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Fifth contributor (Chris Nineham, SWP):</b></p>

<p class="fst">There is a sense in which this debate has been false. John made a
very good critique of the tradition which says a small number of
people should take power for everyone else. It is a critique of
social democracy, of a whole tradition of trying to operate from
above through getting a few individuals into the state. That is a
failed strategy. Those people always get drawn into the system. They
get bullied, bought off or simply compromise with capitalism.</p>

<p>But that is not an argument against the Marxist tradition of
revolutionary politics which says that the capitalist society is our
enemy. We have to get rid of the capitalist state and create a
society that is based on a completely different, radically grassroots structure.</p>

<p>John&#8217;s solution is effectively to say that we just ignore the
state. The question of how we challenge state power has to be central
to everything we discuss, since state power is so visibly shaping the
world around us today.</p>

<p>One reason we cannot avoid confronting the state is that the state
tries to divide us, it tries to separate off each struggle from every
other, women from men, gays from straights, whites from blacks, and
make us think of ourselves in the smallest possible way. We have to
have an argument in the movement that unity is strength &#8211; and that
argument has to be organised. Learning to act together and discussing
it consciously is essential if we are to develop a strategy to take
on the power of the state.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Sixth contributor:</b></p>

<p class="fst">I would really like to know how John&#8217;s theory of changing the
world would apply to Iraq or Palestine, where people are being
attacked daily and their lives turned into misery by the state. They
cannot ignore the state. They have to fight it directly, head on.</p>

<p>My relatives live in Iran. I live in Britain. If the British state
attacks Iran, do I simply ignore it?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Seventh contributor (from South Korea):</b></p>

<p class="fst">We can change the world by taking power or by not taking power.
The difference is one of time. Taking power will be quicker. We
should not be afraid to take power, because we are the ones who will
change the world.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h3 class="western">John Holloway:</h3>

<p class="fst">A lot of people did not want to talk about revolution a few years
ago. But today lots of people want to. Alex and myself are in
agreement on this.</p>

<p>Secondly, someone said this is a false debate. But Alex and I were
not saying the same thing. We have different perspectives. We have
different conceptions of the state. For me it is a specific,
capitalist form of social relations which excludes us, Alex talks
about a workers&#8217; state and the possibility of a radical
democratisation of the state. According to my conception that is
absolutely absurd, since the state has a form of organisation that
excludes us.</p>

<p>To talk about a radical movement, a soviet movement for instance,
culminating in the creation of a new state, is nonsense because a
really democratic organisation, a council organisation goes in one
direction while the state is a form of organisation that goes in the
opposite direction. To talk about a working class state introduces
confusion that conceals the most horrific process of repression and
violence that we have seen several times in the 20th century.</p>

<p>The questioner who spoke of us turning our backs on the state &#8211;
I am not saying we should ignore the state. It would be lovely if we
could. In a way that is what the Zapatistas are doing now. They are
turning their backs on the state. But that is not something that most
of us can do. I am an employee of the state. It is not about
pretending the state does not exist. It is about understanding the
state as a specific form of social relations which pushes us in
certain directions, and trying to think about how we can struggle
against those forms of social relations and push in a different
direction, so that our relation is in and beyond and against the
state. It would be lovely if we could pretend that the state does not
exist. Unfortunately we can&#8217;t. But we certainly don&#8217;t have to
fall into the state as a central reference point in terms of logic or
of power or space.</p>

<p>The question of Venezuela is very important for all the Latin
Americans here. I liked the way the question was presented. It was
not as it is sometimes put in terms of &#8216;Venezuela shows we must
take power.&#8217; It was in terms of Venezuela shows there has to be a
combination of the two approaches &#8211; the state-oriented approach and
the non-state-oriented approach. This is what characterises the World
Social Forum, this combination, a cooperation, between these two
different approaches. But in that we have to see there is always a
tension, a contradiction, between on the one hand saying, &#8216;We
ourselves shall decide how society will develop&#8217; and on the other
hand saying, &#8216;The state will decide for you or show you how to
decide for yourselves.&#8217; It will be very important to see how that
tension plays itself out in Venezuela.</p>

<p>On the question of fissures. We often feel helpless because
capitalism weighs so heavily on us. But when we say No we start off
with an appreciation of our own strength. When we rebel we are in
fact tearing a little hole in capitalism. It is very contradictory.
By rebelling we are already saying no to the command of capital. We
are creating temporary spaces. Within that crack, that fissure, it is
important that we fight for other social relations that don&#8217;t point
towards the state, but that they point towards the sort of society we
want to create. At the core of these fissures is the drive to
self-determination. And then it is a question of working out what
does this mean, and how to be organised for self-determination. It
means being against and beyond the society that exists. Of expanding
the fissures, how to push these fissures forward structurally.</p>

<p>The people who say we should take control of the state are also
talking about cracks. There is no choice but to start with
interstices. The question is how we think of them, because the state
is not the whole world. There are 200 states. If you seize control of
one, it is still only a crack in capitalism. It is a question of how
we think about those cracks, those fissures. And if we start off from
ourselves, why on earth should we adopt capitalist, bourgeois forms
for developing our struggle? Why should we accept the template of the
concept of the state?</p>

<p>It is impossible to focus on the state without having a special
definition of struggle. It means struggling within the space of the
state, whereas at the World Social Forum we are in rebellion against
that space. The space defines a concept of space and time.</p>

<h3 class="western">Alex Callinicos:</h3>

<p class="fst">John said we have a transhistorical conception of the state which
separates the state off from capitalist relations of production. So
let me say clearly that the state under which we live is an
irredeemably capitalist state. I don&#8217;t want to be part of a
movement whose aim is to take control of the existing capitalist state.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this is not the only state that has existed in
history. There have been many different forms of state in the history
of class society. What they have all had in common is organised and
institutionalised class violence, the violence of an exploiting
minority over an exploited majority.</p>

<p>The question we are addressing now is, &#8216;Can the working class as
it organises itself collectively and socially to resist exploitation
by capital turn this situation round?&#8217; In other words, can the
working class create its own form of organised class violence,
distinctively working class in the way it is organised but which
makes the struggle against exploitation by capital more effective and
also helps the working class build a new society? As John knows, the
answer to that question in the classic tradition of Marxism, in the
writing of Marx and Lenin, is yes. There is the idea of a workers&#8217;
state, of workers&#8217; power, which is a temporary transitional form
through which the working class organises itself to get rid of
capitalism and as part of the same process democratically organises
itself to create a new form of society.</p>

<p>I used the L word, I mentioned Lenin, and of course John will say
this question was tried and proved to be definitely wrong during the
Russian Revolution of 1917 and particularly with the Stalinist aftermath.</p>

<p>One of the contributions referred to the great debate between Marx
and Bakunin at the time of the First International in he late 19th
century. He said that the experience of Stalinism proved that
Bakunin&#8217;s anti-state position had been proved to be right. But how
did that happen? If the idea is that state thinking was deep in Marx
or Lenin&#8217;s head and that led to stalinism, it is simply wrong. Marx
said we need a revolution against the state in his critique of
Bakunin. It was an idea Lenin enthusiastically took up during the
1917 revolution.</p>

<p>So how did it happen? John talked about fissures. The Russian
Revolution of 1917 was a fissure. It tore a great hole in the
capitalist system, the biggest fissure so far in world history. But
just to break a hole in capitalism, even a hole as big as Russia, was
not enough. There was a simple reason. The power of capital is global
and it can concentrate its forces massively to destroy any fissure
that threatens it. That is what they have been trying to do with
Ch&#225;vez in Venezuela. Whatever the problem is with his politics and
so on, the US and its allies have been trying to break the experiment
taking place in Venezuela because it threatens to open up a fissure.</p>

<p>The power of capital is so great that usually they can close the
fissures. Usually they do so by overthrowing the revolutionary
process and destroying its leaders and activists. There are many
examples of that. In the Russian case there was a particularly
horrible way in which capital won, by creating such pressures as to
cause the revolutionary regime to transform itself into a barbarous
replica of the global system. The reason that happened was not that
Marx liked the state, but that there was not a powerful enough global
movement to break the power of capital globally. That doesn&#8217;t have
to be our fate. We are already in the process collectively of
creating the greatest global movement against capitalism in world
history. But we won&#8217;t do that if we think that simply creating
holes, fissures, in the existing system is enough to destroy it.</p>

<h3 class="western">Further discussion</h3>

<p class="fst"><b>Eighth contributor (South Korean woman):</b></p>

<p class="fst">If you say we can change the world without taking power, you are
saying that the capitalist power that exists right now is acceptable.
Holloway says that the state excludes us. But the state oppresses us
at every level. Even our sexuality is oppressed by the state. I come
from South Korea where we have a history of military dictatorship and
they have crushed a beautiful resistance. It is not that the state
excludes us but that at every level it oppresses us.</p>

<p>Alex is not saying we have to go into the state and use the power
of the capitalist state. He is saying we have to create new forms of
power where the working class will form an organisation capable of
overthrowing the capitalist state.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Ninth contributor:</b></p>

<p class="fst">Karl Marx said the state was the executive committee of the
bourgeoisie, and that is exactly what it is. Its laws and its
procedures protect profit at the expense of ordinary people and its
won&#8217;t give up those things lightly. That is why we have to deal
with the question of state power.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Tenth contributor (Chris Harman, SWP):</b></p>

<p class="fst">John Holloway said that the position which revolutionary
socialists put forward means that we focus activity on the state.
This is not true. Most of our activity consists in being involved in
struggles of one sort or another &#8211; struggles against repression,
struggles for women&#8217;s liberation, struggles against racism,
struggles over wages, above all at the moment the struggle against
the horrific war waged against Iraq. But what we know from the
experience of our movements is that every time those struggles reach
a certain stage you come up against bodies of armed men &#8211; and these
days mainly armed men and some armed women. And this is the core of
the state. John, you use the word state in a wider sense &#8211;
sometimes we all use it in a wider sense &#8211; but the key sector we
are concerned with is these bodies of armed men.</p>

<p>You can then have two approaches. You can pretend that you can
control them or ignore them. There is the approach of the social
democrats. John says we have the same approach as Lula. We don&#8217;t.
Lula believes he controls the Brazilian state. In reality the
Brazilian state and Brazilian capitalism control Lula. The
hierarchies of armed forces officers, the generals, are the same as
were there under the military dictatorship. All that is different is
a different president and a different parliament.</p>

<p>The other approach is to say that you can ignore the state, leave
it to later. That is all right until it starts breaking up your
picket line or waging war. Every struggle reaches a moment where the
question of force becomes decisive.</p>

<p>Gramsci made the point in his distinction between a war of
position, a slow struggle to unify people, to fight back, to get some
resistance. That is what we are involved in most of the time. But at
some point you have to wage a war of manoeuvre. You have to move
forward to challenge the state. And if you don&#8217;t do that, Latin
America is full of histories of what happens. In 1964 the military
coup in Brazil, in 1973 the coup in Uruguay, in 1973 in Chile, in
1976 in Argentina. On each occasion people said, &#8216;We don&#8217;t need
to challenge the state, just build the movements from below with the
parliamentarians and we will win.&#8217; On each occasion the state hit back.</p>

<p>And I say to the comrades who talk about Venezuela, unfortunately,
the state in Venezuela is still essentially the same state as before.
The country has transformed itself massively in the last six years.
It is much more hopeful than six years ago. But the state remains the
same. Many of the old officers are still there, the civil service
works in the same way, the same hierarchies remain. And so at some
point in Venezuela the point will come where either people will begin
to form workers&#8217; and soldiers&#8217; councils to challenge that state
or the state will crush them.</p>

<p>John Holloway&#8217;s real misunderstanding of Marxism is not to
understand that the central point of Marxism is that from below we
can create new structures, structures that have to be democratic,
have to be based on mass self-emancipation, self-activity, but have
to be centralised and have at some decisive point to disarm the
ruling class before they kill us.<br/>

<p class="fst"><b>Eleventh contributor:</b></p>

<p class="fst">I want to use the experience of Argentina since the Argentinazo of
2001 to underline the points made by Alex. We had the biggest
movement of the unemployed anywhere in the world in recent years.
Factories were occupied and taken over by workers. They demonstrated
that you did not need a capitalist class to keep production going. In
the districts of the capital popular assemblies were extremely
radical. In hundreds of places people got together and discussed and
determined how they would act and what political direction they would
take. And in the first few weeks after the Argentinazo several
governments were overthrown. There was a brutal process in which many
comrades died. It was an example of how we can develop our movements.</p>

<p>But what Argentina showed, brutally, was how the state still
existed. We have all these examples of important and very radical
organisations. But not only did the state exclude and marginalise us,
it turned on us, it repressed us, it drove down our wages and
repressed our movement. Today there are 30 political prisoners in
Argentina and thousands more who are due for trial at some point
soon, and we have in power a government under Kirchner which is not
particularly different to Lula.</p>

<p>The state showed how real its existence was. On the other hand we
had a huge popular mobilisation, created radical movements involving
very large numbers of people which nevertheless had this weakness,
which is they did not address the question of state power. So today
we still have a capitalist government despite the movement&#8217;s
existence and its combativity, It&#8217;s not enough for workers to
develop a social movement, although its existence is indispensable.
We also need a perspective of taking on the question of political
power. Otherwise the state will show its existence with attacks on us.</p>
