<p class="fst"><strong>Frontiers: The Epic of South Africa&#8217;s Creation and the Tragedy of the Xhosa People</strong><br/>
Noel Mostert<br/>
<em>Pimlico &#163;15</em></p>

<p class="fst">One of the many luxuries Europe&#8217;s rulers have given themselves
is that of reflecting &#8211; in retrospect, of course, not at the time &#8211;
on the pathos and tragedy of the various peoples they have conquered.
In southern Africa the destruction by Britain of the great Zulu
kingdom has attracted the most attention.</p>

<p>Arguably, the story of the Xhosa people, the confederacy of
chiefdoms in South Africa&#8217;s eastern Cape, is an even greater
tragedy. They formed the first organised African political unit of
any strength which the Dutch settlers encountered as they expanded
beyond the original white colony at the Cape during the 18th century.</p>

<p>It took almost 100 years of war, from 1781 to 1878, for the Cape
Colony finally to defeat the Xhosa people and to incorporate them and
their land. No less than nine wars &#8211; white historians used to call
them the &#8216;Kaffir Wars&#8217; but they tend now to be known, more
euphemistically, as the Frontier Wars &#8211; were required to break
Xhosa power.</p>

<p>They began as minor border skirmishes over land and cattle between
Xhosa chiefdoms and <em>trekboers</em>, settlers straying outside the
control of the Dutch East India Company at Cape Town and developing a
way of life based on cattle herding and hunting quite similar in some
respects to those of the Xhosa and other African peoples. As the
Marxist historian Martin Legassick pointed out in a pathbreaking
essay, relations on the frontier in the early days were not ones of
naked racism, but involved cooperation as well as conflict, and
sometimes intermarriage among Afrikaners, Africans and Khoikoi (the
ancestors of the modern &#8216;Coloureds&#8217;).</p>

<p>It was the incorporation of the Cape Colony into the British
Empire, temporarily in the 1790s, definitively in 1806, which changed
this pattern. Although the British colonial authorities introduced
legal equality between the races and abolished slavery, they also
planted a large settlement of British colonists in the eastern Cape
in 1820. English speaking sheep farmers in the eastern Cape,
producing wool for the booming British market, began to assert their
need, in even more strident terms, for Xhosa land and labour.</p>

<p>It was indeed British military power, directed by a succession of
Peninsular War veterans such as Benjamin D&#8217;Urban, Charles Napier,
and Harry Smith, which gradually broke the Xhosa. Xhosa leaders such
as Magoma waged brilliant guerrilla campaigns against the lumbering
redcoats, but British firepower, and the use of methods to become
familiar in 20th century counterinsurgency warfare &#8211; the
destruction of crops and the seizure of cattle to starve the Xhosa
into surrender &#8211; wore them down. Each war left the Xhosa worse off
than the last. They and their cattle were bottled up on less land,
with magistrates and missionaries interfering ever more intrusively
into their traditional way of life.</p>

<p>The most tragic episode of all came in 1856&#8211;8. A young woman
called Nongqawuse claimed to have had visions which announced that if
the Xhosa killed all their cattle and emptied their cornbins, the
dead would be resurrected, the slain cattle would be replaced with
interest, and the whites would be swept away. It is a sign of the
deep despair into which the Xhosa had fallen &#8211; cattle played an
absolutely indispensable economic and cultural role in pre-colonial
African societies &#8211; that many believed the prophecy and slaughtered
their cattle.</p>

<p>In the last desperate hope it represented a leap back into the
past. The cattle killing resembled the Ghost Dance movement among the
American Plains Indians at the end of the 1880s. It had even more
disastrous consequences. Perhaps 40,000 people died in the ensuing
famine. The British governor, Sir George Grey, unscrupulously used
the Xhosa&#8217;s appalling plight to incorporate many of them as wage
labourers within the colony. Although one final war was to follow,
the Xhosa were finished as an independent people. Their chiefs were
imprisoned on Robben island, where Nelson Mandela &#8211; himself a
prince of the Xhosa speaking Thembe &#8211; was to spend so many years.</p>

<p>The conquest of the Xhosa is an epic story, and Noel Mostert does
his best to give it an appropriate treatment. Himself a Cape
Afrikaner, he writes of the Xhosa and their suffering with great
sympathy. His book has, however, been overpraised. The <strong>Wall Street
Journal</strong> compares it to Gibbon and Macaulay. But Gibbon and
Macaulay were superb prose stylists, writing vigorous and elegant
English. Mostert&#8217;s sentences, by contrast, tend to cut themselves
loose from the rules of logic and grammar, and meander on until they
make very little sense. He is overgiven to fine writing, repeats
himself, and includes much irrelevant material. The result is a book
which, at more than 1,300 pages, cries out for a good, tough editor.</p>

<p>Self indulgent writing tends to reflect sloppy thinking. Gibbon
and Macaulay had behind them the self confident rationalism of the
Enlightenment. Though Mostert makes quite good use of the latest
historical research, his head is full of the intellectual bric-a-brac
of the 20th century. Behind his babble about Jung and the African
&#8216;sense of wholeness&#8217; looms the shadow of Prince Charles&#8217;s
asinine South African mentor, Sir Laurens van der Post. The Xhosa
deserve better than this.</p>
