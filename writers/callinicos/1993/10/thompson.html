at his later writings</strong></p>

<p class="fst">Edward Thompson was probably the greatest of the extraordinary
group of Marxist historians who emerged in the Communist Party of
Great Britain after the Second World War. Like many of them, he left
the party as a result of the crisis of 1956 which, it is clear from
Thompson&#8217;s later writings, formed henceforth the main political
reference point of his life. He sought to make the break with
Stalinism he had then made into the basis of a rethinking of Marxist theory.</p>

<p>This projected reconstruction of Marxism did not take the form
chiefly of philosophical treatises, but rather informs his historical
writings. The fact that traces of the Stalinist past can still be
detected in Thompson&#8217;s thought and in his approach to politics
should not take away from the scale of his achievement.</p>
<p>Thompson sought on various occasions formally to defend his
version of Marxism, most notably in <strong>The Poverty of Theory</strong>, his
great polemic against Louis Althusser&#8217;s attempt to give an
&#8216;anti-humanist&#8217; reading of Marx. Marxism is not, Thompson
insisted, about the unfolding of objective economic laws, the
impersonal development of the productive forces. Rather at the heart
of Marxism is &#8216;human agency ... men and women as subjects of their
own history&#8217;.</p>

<p>Nowhere was this view of Marxism more movingly stated than in the
famous <em>Preface</em> to <strong>The Making of the English Working Class</strong>:
&#8216;I am seeking to rescue the poor stockinger, the Luddite cropper,
the &#8220;obsolete&#8221; hand-loom weaver, the &#8220;utopian&#8221; artisan, and
even the deluded follower of Joanna Southcott, from the enormous
condescension of posterity.&#8217;</p>

<p>This statement is sometimes misinterpreted as mere sentimentality
or antiquarianism. Rather it reflected Thompson&#8217;s political and
theoretical insistence that the English working class was not merely
the passive product of impersonal economic mechanisms but took shape
in &#8216;an active process, which owes as much to agency as to
conditioning. The working class did not rise like the sun at an
appointed time. It was present at its own making.&#8217;</p>

<p>People over-impressed by various Parisian philosophers would from
time to time tax Thompson with empiricism, with a slavish obsession
with facts. (I&#8217;m afraid that, in my thoughtless youth, I was
counted among their number.) He was, however, no mindless fact
grubber. He had the gift of the really great historian of being able
to elicit from obscure concrete details complex and wide ranging
interpretations of entire societies. Nowhere was this put to better
use than in <strong>Whigs and Hunters</strong>, where Thompson built up, from a
study of the Black Act, a particularly vicious piece of 18th century
penal legislation, a stunning portrait of Hanoverian England and its
internal strains. He pursued this study in his recent <strong>Customs in
Common</strong> whose long introductory essay is as sparkling and exciting
a piece of historical interpretation as anything Thompson ever wrote.</p>

<p>The quality of Thompson&#8217;s work as a historian is beyond dispute.
But did he succeed in rethinking Marxism? A number of left wing
academics have argued that to a large extent he did. They are,
however, mistaken. Most obviously, as numerous critics have pointed
out, in seeking to correct the dire intellectual effects of
Stalinism, Thompson ended up so stressing (theoretically at any rate,
his historical writings are generally more careful) the role of
subjectivity &#8211; of consciousness, culture and agency &#8211; that the
objective context of human action virtually disappeared. He went as
far as to try to drum out of historical materialism Marx&#8217;s great
economic works, the <strong>Grundrisse</strong> and even to some extent
<strong>Capital</strong>, because they were concerned, of necessity, with
analysing the objective structures of capitalist exploitation and accumulation.</p>

<p>As so often happens, what Thompson kicked out of the front door
climbed back through the window. In the early 1980s he suspended his
historical studies in order to become active in the peace movement,
which had been revived by a new hotting up of the Cold War. This
action was greatly to his credit. Nevertheless it was theoretically
justified &#8211; for example, in <strong>Notes on Exterminism</strong> &#8211; by the
claim that the arms race between the superpowers had developed into a
distinct social system, operating according to its own logic largely
independently of the class structure of American and Russian
societies. It followed that &#8216;exterminism&#8217; (as Thompson named this
new system) could not be combated, as Lenin and Trotsky had argued
imperialist wars should be fought, through class struggle, but
through building broad alliances which transcended class.</p>

<p>The historian of human agency built up a picture of exterminism as
so powerful and autonomous an objective structure (one is almost
tempted to apply to it Althusser&#8217;s formula of &#8216;a process without
a subject&#8217;) that only the rallying together of (more or less) the
whole of humanity could defeat it. By setting the peace movement&#8217;s
sights so high Thompson may have caused as many people to despair as
he inspired to act. Certainly, when the Cold War did come to an end
it was caused by a straightforward social and political collapse in
the Stalinist bloc.</p>

<p>It is striking, however, how far Thompson&#8217;s call for &#8216;an
alliance that takes in churches, Eurocommunists, Labourists, East
European dissidents (and not only dissidents), Soviet citizens
unmediated by Party structures, trade unionists, ecologists resembles
the kind of popular fronts pursued by the Communist Parties during
the 1930s and 1940s, usually to disastrous effect.</p>

<p>Thompson joined the CP during the Second World War at the height
of left wing enthusiasm for nationalist resistance to Hitler, and,
for better or for worse, never completely overcame its influence.
Even his writings on the 18th century tend to uncover coalitions of
dissident gentry and disaffected artisans and peasants struggling
against the Whig ascendancy that was grinding down the old &#8216;moral
economy&#8217; by promoting the spread of capitalist social
relationships. Thompson&#8217;s analyses of these struggles are
extraordinarily subtle and illuminating, but one does sometimes
wonder if he half consciously projects them forward as the ancestors
of the 20th century popular fronts.</p>

<p>The CP shaped Thompson for better as well as for worse. In a
television interview a few weeks before his death, he described how
still, after almost 50 years, he missed being in a party which united
workers and middle class intellectuals in discussion and activity.
For all his faults, Thompson was a socialist fighter and remained so
till the end. <strong>Customs in Common</strong> contains some splendid pages
of polemic against Michael Ignatieff and other intellectual
apologists for the market. Edward Thompson is dead, but we still have
his wonderful books to read and learn from.</p>
