<p class="fst">The international movement against capitalist globalisation has
been globally visible for nearly a decade now. It started with the
Chiapas rising of January 1994 and the French public sector strikes
of November&#8211;December 1995, and exploded onto the global stage at
the Seattle protests in November 1999. It then enjoyed a period of
dynamic expansion through the launch of the World Social Forum (WSF)
in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in January 2001, the massive confrontation
at the G8 summit in Genoa in July 2001, and the first European Social
Forum in Florence in November 2002. The culmination was the enormous
demonstrations against the war in Iraq between February and April
2003. Subsequently, however, there has not been the same forward
impetus. Indeed, increasingly centrifugal pressures and even a degree
of disarray have become evident. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p>The seventh World Social Forum, held in Nairobi, Kenya, in January
2007, may have marked a turning point. The forum was far from being a
disaster, despite the questionable decision to hold it in a country
with weak social movements. Some 46,000 people participated, the
majority from Kenya itself and around a quarter from the rest of
Africa &#8211; no mean achievement, given the poverty and vast distances
of the continent. The coming together of activists involved movements
from across Africa and the rest of the Global South, as well as from
the North, generated some of the energy on display at the earlier
world and European forums. And the opening and closing marches, from
the slum settlements of Kibera and Kariobongi respectively, did offer
a vivid sense of the convergence of global struggles, even if they
were relatively small.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the forum was also crippled by internal controversy.
Many local and foreign activists expressed the view, summarised by
one of the organisers, Onyango Oloo, national coordinator of the
Kenya Social Forum, that &#8220;the event gave rise to disturbing and
negative tendencies such as commercialisation, militarisation and
authoritarian and undemocratic decision-making&#8221;. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>
Particular anger was caused by the sponsorship of the forum by a
mobile phone company, the high entrance fees charged to Kenyan
participants, the dominance of catering by elite local hospitality
firms such as the Windsor and Norfolk, and the pervasive presence of
the police and military. The tensions climaxed when a coalition of
Kenyan slum-dwellers and foreign activists led by Trevor Ngwane of
the South African Anti-Privatisation Forum stormed the Windsor
restaurant, owned by John Michuki, minister of internal security (and
known by Kenyans as Kimendeero, the crusher, because of his role for
the British colonial regime during the 1950s Mau Mau rebellion), and
redistributed its contents. Oloo paints a damning insider&#8217;s
portrait of the undemocratic way in which the forum was run. He tells
of &#8220;a political evaluation of the WSF&#8221; by &#8220;perhaps the most
high profile member of the organising committee&#8221; which refers to
&#8220;glue-sucking urchins from Korogocho&#8221; (a slum in northern
Nairobi), while dismissing most of the critics of the process as
&#8220;condescending Trotskyites from the North&#8221;. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>
The Filipino intellectual and activist Walden Bello, one of the
movement&#8217;s most consistent strategic thinkers, writes, &#8220;There was
a strong sense of going backward rather than forward in Nairobi.&#8221;
<a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Italian trade unionist Bruno Ciccaglione criticises what he calls
&#8220;the tendencies ... to transform the WSF into a
folklorist/commercial event&#8221;, but argues that these are only
symptoms. &#8220;The real problem&#8221; is the divergence in what is
happening to the different movements that were the driving force in
the WSF process:</p>

<p class="quoteb">On the one side the European movements, able to produce
large mobilisations and concrete victories in past years, are today
in a deep crisis and do not look capable to have unitary and common
mobilisations at a continental level, and, sometimes, like Italy,
even at a national level. On the other side the Latin American
movements, very strong at the moment, are living an interesting and
successful period ... but they are a lot more concentrated on their
own continent rather than on a worldwide perspective. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This loss of impetus can be traced in the trajectory of the most
powerful anti-capitalist organisation in Europe, Attac France.
Founded in 1998 to campaign for the regulation of financial
speculation, it initially grew explosively, attaining a membership of
30,000 by 2001, and spawning affiliates in many other countries.
However, Attac&#8217;s membership stagnated in 2002&#8211;4 and then started
to decline, falling to 21,000 in 2006. This reflected an increasingly
bitter internal crisis that drove Attac to the verge of a split by
the end of last year. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p>There are in fact a number of issues that we need to analyse to
begin to understand this sense of crisis in the European movement.
There are inherent difficulties with common mobilisations, there are
weaknesses in the methods and practices of the social forum movement,
and there are political problems that have emerged in the process of
developing the wider movements. This article aims to help develop
this understanding. Its focus is largely on Europe because this is
the region that we know best and it is here that the crisis in the
anti-capitalist movement is most visible.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The dialectic of national and global</h4>

<p class="fst">Global capitalism is subject to what Leon Trotsky called the law
of uneven and combined development. So too are the movements that
resist it. The anti-capitalist movement developed certain key
national bases during its initial phase of dynamic expansion. The Al
Qaida attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001
crippled the North American coalition of activists that had been
responsible for the Seattle protests and had expanded rapidly
thereafter. Fortunately, an axis had already developed through the
first WSF in Porto Alegre between Attac in France and a coalition of
Brazilian NGOs and social movements (notably the MST landless
labourers&#8217; movement and the CUT trade union federation), which gave
the movement a stable global framework. A powerful third partner came
from the explosive development of the social forum movement in Italy,
under the inspiration of the WSF and hugely accelerated by the
confrontation at the Genoa G8 summit in July 2001. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>
Others played an important role &#8211; for instance the Indian
organisers of the most successful WSF to date, in Mumbai in January
2004 &#8211; but the most politically important relationships were
between these three partners.</p>

<p>Relations within the Franco-Italian-Brazilian trinity were never
exactly harmonious. Neither Attac nor its partners in the Brazilian
based WSF organising committee were happy about the high profile
involvement of the <em>Partito della Rifondazione Comunista</em> (the
Refounded Communist Party) in the Italian movement. Bernard Cassen,
first president of Attac, was openly critical of the emphasis on the
war at the first European Social Forum in Florence in November 2002.
<a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> That emphasis also drew the Italians
closer in 2001&#8211;3 to the emerging anti-war movement in Britain &#8211;
the object of much mistrust from both Attac and various autonomists
because of the role of the radical left in its leadership.
Nevertheless, these tensions were relatively easy to manage till
after Florence and the anti-war protests of early 2003.</p>

<p>Greater internal polarisation became visible in 2003&#8211;4, reaching
a crescendo at the third European Social Forum in London in October
2004. In part it involved a natural process of political
differentiation. As the movement developed, it confronted
increasingly demanding questions about how to pursue the struggle
both against neoliberalism and against the imperialist offensive
mounted by the United States and its allies. The diverging responses
led to the crystallisation of distinct political tendencies within
the movement &#8211; a reformist right wing, focused on Attac and its
international network, seeking a return to a more regulated
capitalism; autonomists who claimed to be transcending traditional
debates on the left and building localised alternatives to capitalism
in the here and now; and a radical left seeking to get rid of
capitalism altogether. Such a clash of different political
perspectives was inevitable, though debate was often obfuscated by
the tendency of the right wing to use autonomist language and even
(as at the London European Social Forum) to ally with the autonomists
against the left. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p>But the subsequent evolution of the movement has shown it has
other problems. A key characteristic of the anti-capitalist movement
has been its transnational character (hence it was always a misnomer
to call it the &#8220;anti-globalisation movement&#8221;, since it has from
its inception been the most international of movements: for those
reluctant to apply the label &#8220;anti-capitalist&#8221;, &#8220;the movement
for another globalisation&#8221; and &#8220;<em>altermondialiste</em> movement&#8221;
are much better alternatives). But this poses the problem of how it
pursues a genuinely transnational struggle. International
mobilisations against G8 summits and World Trade Organisation
meetings are one answer, but these are intermittent and artificial
events, and are too vulnerable to the contingencies of location
(which tend, precisely because of the protests, to be ever more
remote) to be the basis for a sustained movement.</p>

<p>Opposition to the war in Iraq offered a genuinely universal
unifying issue. No wonder, then, that 15 February 2003 represents a
historic peak of global mass protest. But the bulk of the movement
did not persist with anti-war mobilisation once Baghdad had fallen on
9 April 2003. There were a variety of reasons for this. As we have
seen, one very influential actor, Attac, regarded the war as a
diversion from the real priority of opposing neoliberal
globalisation. Moreover, in much of continental Europe the peace
movements also gave up serious anti-war campaigning. This reflected
their origins as pacifist groupings campaigning against nuclear
weapons during the Cold War. Ideologically and temperamentally they
were ill-equipped to respond to a conflict pitting American
imperialism against enemies it portrayed as &#8220;Islamo-fascist&#8221;, and
so threw in the towel with some relief.</p>

<p>In the US itself the luxury of not talking about the war wasn&#8217;t
available, and the US anti-war movement has mobilised on a very
impressive scale. A series of historic demonstrations and the stand
of anti-war troops and their families have helped to turn US opinion
overwhelmingly against the war, a feat many had felt was impossible.
But from the start the anti-war movement was divided. There was
Answer, led by pro-North Korean Stalinists who have subsequently
themselves split, and there was the much broader and more mainstream
United for Peace and Justice. Many of this organisation&#8217;s leaders
and supporters allowed themselves to be diverted into John Kerry&#8217;s
presidential campaign in 2004, in the vain hope that even a pro-war
Democrat would be better than George Bush. The distraction was doubly
damaging because of the demoralisation caused by Kerry&#8217;s defeat. It
is only in the past year or so that the American anti-war movement
has begun to recover from these setbacks.</p>

<p>There were, of course, exceptions to the pattern of dropping the
issue of the war once it had started. The Spanish anti-war movement,
though never well coordinated at a national level, played an
important role in turning the tragedy of the Madrid train bombings
into a rout for the warmongering Aznar government in March 2004. The
movements in Turkey and Greece have continued to make an impact on
their national political scene. But the most important exception has
been the Stop the War Coalition in Britain, a new kind of anti-war
movement founded specifically to oppose the &#8220;war on terrorism&#8221;,
whose radical left leadership has been able to sustain a broad
coalition with considerable popular support and mobilising power.</p>

<p>At an international level, Focus on the Global South, whose roots
lie in the 1990s campaigns against trade and debt from which the
anti_capitalist movement emerged, has shown a very clear
understanding of the connections between neoliberalism and
imperialism and has devoted considerable effort to maintaining a
global anti-war network. The annual Cairo Conference has built
powerful links between the opposition in the most important Arab
state and some Northern anti-war coalitions. But, important though
these different initiatives are, and despite the fact that there is
deep seated popular opposition everywhere to Bush&#8217;s &#8220;long war&#8221;,
the fact remains that there is currently no real <em>global</em>
movement against the war.</p>

<p>No other issue has emerged to replace the war as a transnational
mobilising focus. The idea was floated at a meeting in Genoa in July
2003 of building &#8220;a social 15 February&#8221;. It was a wonderful idea,
but, in the circumstances, utopian. Everyone, wherever they were,
could campaign against the war in Iraq. But neoliberal attacks
necessarily unfold on a national terrain. Even when they reflect
global or (within the European Union) continental initiatives by
capital, the timing and content of their implementation are shaped by
the nation-state concerned. Taking up what in the European movement
has come to be called &#8220;the social question&#8221; therefore has a
centrifugal logic.</p>

<p>Now in many ways this is a welcome development. The old
establishment taunt at the anti-capitalist movement was that it was
an elitist travelling circus. But the movement has in fact sunk real,
national roots in some parts of the world. In Europe this has
happened in a number of countries, notably France, Italy, Germany,
Greece and Britain. But this has produced diverging political
priorities in different countries.</p>

<p>For example, there has been a long-running debate between the
movements in France and Britain over the relative priority of the war
and &#8220;the social question&#8221;. In part, this reflects real political
disagreements arising from different appreciations of the
relationship between neoliberalism and imperialism. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>At the same time, the different socio-political realities of the
two countries mean that the issues differ in their mobilising power.
France is the European country that has witnessed the most sustained
resistance to neoliberalism, with social explosions in 1995, 2003,
2005, and 2006. In Britain, perhaps because neoliberalism was imposed
here first and most comprehensively under the Thatcher government in
the 1980s, there is a degree of popular fatalism about the
possibility of stopping or reversing the inroads of the market that
has, for example, made it difficult to mount effective mass agitation
against the Bolkestein Directive aimed at privatising public services
in the European Union. The war in Iraq has, by contrast, generated
enormous popular anger that continues to bring large demonstrations
onto the streets.</p>

<p>These difficulties have not made cross-border mobilisations
against neoliberalism impossible. On the contrary, respectable
<em>altermondialiste</em> contingents took part in protests in Brussels
in March 2005 and Strasbourg in February 2006. But the reach of these
mobilisations was limited to north western Europe and participants
numbered in thousands, not tens or hundreds of thousands. This
pattern will no doubt change with the further development of social
resistance to neoliberalism &#8211; Britain included, since increasing
pressure on living standards may lead to a revival in workers&#8217;
struggles here &#8211; but this future prospect doesn&#8217;t alter the
present limitations of the movement.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The troubled return of politics</h4>

<p class="fst">Greater engagement by the movements with their national realities
has a further complicating effect. The more anti-capitalist
coalitions find themselves operating in a national arena, the harder
it is to evade the political field. But one of the founding myths of
the movement is its separation from political parties, reflected in
the famous ban on their participation in social forums in the WSF
Charter of Principles. This was a symptom of what Daniel Bensa&#239;d has
aptly called:</p>

<p class="quoteb">A &#8220;social illusion&#8221; ... an illusion in the
self-sufficiency of social movements reflected in the experiences
after Seattle (1999) and the first World Social Forum in Porto Alegre
(2001). Simplifying somewhat, I call this the &#8220;utopian moment&#8221; of
social movements, which took different forms: utopias based on the
regulation of free markets; Keynesian utopias; and above all
neo-libertarian utopias, in which the world can be changed without
taking power or making do with counter-powers (John Holloway, Toni
Negri, Richard Day). <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The ideology of autonomous social movements developed during the
1970s and 1980s, as the left and the organised working class suffered
serious defeats. It is therefore not surprising that it should be a
major influence on activists mobilising against neoliberalism. Many
of them were veterans of these defeats. They are often based in
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that, by virtue of their social
role, have a complex relationship of both distance from and
dependence on official politics, or, as in France and Italy, they are
based in the broad activist coalitions through which the
<em>altermondialiste</em> movement began to develop in the course of
the 1990s. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> As time has gone on,
this ideology has become a growing obstacle to the further
development of the movement.</p>

<p>This can be seen in all three countries of the dominant trinity.
In Brazil the ban on parties in the Porto Alegre charter was
hypocrisy from the start. The WSF depended on a tacit understanding
between its founders and the Workers&#8217; Party, which was, at the time
of the WSF launch, in opposition at the federal level but in control
of the city of Porto Alegre and the state of Rio Grande do Sul of
which it is the capital. The election of Workers&#8217; Party leader Lula
as president in October 2002 posed an acute problem for the movement
both locally and internationally, since he stuck to the neoliberal
economic policies of his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso.</p>

<p>The increasing integration of the Workers&#8217; Party leadership in
Brazilian capitalism caused revulsion among many activists and
intellectuals previously loyal to the party. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a>
The Porto Alegre WSF in January 2005 was marked by a visible
polarisation, with Lula addressing the forum at its start and Hugo
Ch&#225;vez speaking to a huge rally of the young at its end. That put
the Porto Alegre charter on life support and dramatised the choice
facing the left in Latin America between a regional version of
Blairism and the search for 21st century socialism.</p>

<p>In France the pressure of the political field has been both more
complex and more demanding. Probably the most important single impact
that the anti-capitalist movement has had in a national arena was the
role altermondialistes played in the campaign that defeated the
neoliberal European Constitutional Treaty in the French referendum of
29 May 2005. Considerable credit must go to the leadership of Attac
for identifying the issue of the constitution as a major challenge to
the movement. But a decisive role in that movement was played by the
traditional political organisations of the left, despite the
contribution of Attac and other <em>altermondialiste</em> groups.</p>

<p>The French Socialist Party split as its rank and file rebelled
against its leadership &#8211; a development that was matched in the CGT,
the biggest trade union federation. A leading role within the
national network of 29 May collectives was played by the Socialist
Party left (and not so left) alongside the Communist Party and the
<em>Ligue Communiste R&#233;volutionnaire</em> (LCR). This was, as Stathis
Kouvelakis put it, &#8220;the triumph of the political&#8221;: &#8220;The real
significance of the referendum process was the popular mobilisation
which took hold of political questions on a scale not seen since the
early 1970s&#8221;. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>Building on this victory has, alas, proved very difficult. A
strong will developed after the referendum to continue the coalition
that had delivered the No vote and to give it a political expression
by running a unitary anti-neoliberal candidate in the presidential
elections of April-May 2007. This was, however, sabotaged by the two
most important political organisations of the radical left, though
they did so by pursuing opposed strategies. The Communist Party
sought to embrace and indeed in many cases take over the 29 May
collectives in order to gain their support for the candidacy of the
party&#8217;s general secretary, Marie-George Buffet. The LCR, by
contrast, kept aloof and concentrated on preparing the presidential
campaign of its candidate, Olivier Besancenot, a stance it justified
on the grounds that the collectives had failed to rule out in
principle participating in a social-liberal coalition government
headed by the Socialist Party.</p>

<p>The result was chaos, rancour and division in the collectives.
Instead of a unitary anti-neoliberal candidate running in the first
round of the presidential elections on 22 April, the political
fragmentation on the radical left actually increased compared to the
first round five years before, with Jos&#233; Bov&#233; running as the
candidate of the rump of the collectives against Buffet, Besancenot
and two other Trotskyist candidates. The cohesion of the organised
left has also been weakened, with powerful minorities in both the
Communist Party and the LCR opposed to their parties&#8217; official positions.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the political organisations has increased
hostility to parties and thereby strengthened the ideology of
autonomous social movements. Besancenot&#8217;s success in coming fifth
in the first round with over 4 percent of the vote, well ahead of
Buffet and Bov&#233;, salvaged something from this debacle, but it places
a heavy responsibility on the LCR to take the initiative in building
a genuinely united radical left.</p>

<p>The crisis of the French radical left also affected Attac. The
replacement in 2002 of Cassen as president of Attac France by his
chosen heir Jacques Nikonoff marked the beginning of an increasingly
bitter faction fight. It pitted the two of them against a loose left
that saw Attac as an important ingredient in a broader coalition of
social movements rather than, as Susan George (sponsor of the
opposition slate for the Attac leadership) put it, &#8220;a hierarchical,
top-down pyramidal organisation with a strong executive, able to give
orders to its troops and eventually to serve their private political
ambitions on the French left&#8221;. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p>Cassen and Nikonoff made an abortive attempt to run an
<em>altermondialiste</em> list in the European parliamentary elections
in May 2004 and sought unsuccessfully to keep Attac local committees
out of the collectives formed to oppose the European Constitution a
year later. But, as Rapha&#235;l Wintrebert has documented in his
important study of Attac, the shockingly autocratic methods used by
Cassen and particularly by Nikonoff were an important factor in the
developing polarisation. After the referendum victory Attac imploded
into a fierce internal struggle that became worse after the National
Administrative Council elections held in June 2006 were denounced by
the defeated left opposition on grounds of fraud (their claims were
upheld by two internal inquiries). The opposition won the restaged
elections the following December but Cassen and Nikonoff showed their
intention to continue the struggle by forming their own network,
<em>Avenir d&#8217;Attac</em>. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>It was in Italy that the troubling question of the political
representation of the social movements has had the most disastrous
consequences. Fausto Bertinotti, general secretary of Rifondazione,
closely identified his party with the social forums during their
heady expansion between Genoa and Florence. He brilliantly used the
abstract and ambiguous vocabulary of autonomism to give the
impression that Rifondazione fully identified with the most radical
ambitions of the anti-capitalist movement, without committing himself
to anything very definite. But, as the social forums lost impetus,
Bertinotti turned back towards mainstream politics.</p>

<p>He prepared the way for the party&#8217;s return to the centre-left
(from which it had broken in 1998) with a campaign in 2004 committing
Rifondazione to pacifism and opposition to political violence. The
logical culmination of the process was Rifondazione&#8217;s entry into
the centre-left government formed by Romano Prodi after he narrowly
won the Italian general election in April 2006. Ironically, in the
light of Bertinotti&#8217;s earlier pacifist professions, this led to
Rifondazione voting to support Italy&#8217;s participation in the Nato
military mission in Afghanistan and expelling a far left senator who
abstained in one parliamentary division on this issue.</p>

<p>The effect on the anti-war movement in Italy, hitherto the largest
in Europe, was nothing short of catastrophic. Piero Bernocchi of the
left union Cobas described the situation at the end of 2006:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There is now a big split in the Italian anti-war
movement. A first part doesn&#8217;t give to the occupation of
Afghanistan the same importance as the occupation of Iraq; to avoid
going against Prodi&#8217;s government, it didn&#8217;t want to organise
anything when the government decided to maintain the troops in
Afghanistan and this part is for the Italian troops in Lebanon. The
second part is for withdrawal from Afghanistan but not from Lebanon.
The third part, in which Cobas are, is for the end of all the Italian
war missions (Afghanistan, Lebanon, Kosovo, etc.). <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The consequences of these divisions were visible on the streets of
Rome. On the first anniversary of the invasion of Iraq in March 2004
a million people had marched in Rome. Three years later only 30,000
demonstrated. Given the central role that the Italian social forums
had played for the anti-capitalist movement globally at the time of
Genoa and Florence, this was a disastrous development.</p>
<p>If the French case showed the difficulty in gaining political
representation for the social movements and of overcoming the
divisions among the established left organisations, the Italian
situation highlighted the dependence of movements on parties. Despite
all the talk of autonomous social movements, when Bertinotti moved
rightwards, he pulled the Italian movement along with him,
fragmenting it in the process. Both examples illustrate,
unfortunately in negative terms, that movements seeking to challenge
neoliberalism and imperialism cannot escape the political field.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Fragmentation and drift</h4>

<p class="fst">These political divisions were greatly reinforced by the
increasingly dysfunctional way in which the anti-capitalist movement
organises itself. From Seattle onwards the principle has prevailed
that decisions are taken in assemblies open to all and on the basis
of consensus. This method of decision making did have some advantages
in the early phase of the movement&#8217;s development. Giving everyone a
veto helped to build trust in a new coalition involving actors from
very different backgrounds and it bypassed the problem of deciding
how to weigh the votes of different organisations, which would have
been raised by a system of delegate democracy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are very high costs to this supposedly
&#8220;horizontal&#8221; form of democracy. It is subject to what was long
ago identified in the American women&#8217;s movement as &#8220;the tyranny
of structurelessness&#8221;: in the absence of formal structure, informal
elites emerge to ensure that the movement actually functions. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a>
This has been very visible in the European Social Forum (ESF)
process, where an alliance of the French and Italian <em>altermondialiste</em>
coalitions has largely dominated decision making.</p>

<p>From the start, securing consensus has frequently involved
backdoor bargaining to arrive at compromises; recalcitrant minorities
have sometimes been bullied into not exercising their right to veto
decisions; chair-people, seeking to manage difficult and often
lengthy meetings, have always sought to steer discussion, sometimes
in a very directive way. Moreover, the quickly established procedure
of taking decisions at the European Preparatory Assembly, whose venue
shifts each time from one European city to another, tended to ensure
the dominance of large organisations &#8211; trade unions, NGOs, the
different branches of Attac, political parties &#8211; with the resources
to send delegates to these meetings.</p>

<p>Instead of recognition of these defects, leading to a serious
attempt to improve the democratic functioning of the process, there
has been a marked degeneration. In the lead-up to the London ESF,
Italian and to a lesser extent French delegates persistently
intervened to support the opposition of a fairly marginal grouping of
autonomists to the British coalition responsible for bringing the
forum to London, and acquiesced in the attempts violently to disrupt
the forum and the closing rally. Subsequently, however, the situation
became substantially worse.</p>

<p>The Athens ESF, held in May 2006, had to contend with deep
political divisions. On one side was the Greek Social Forum, a
coalition of far left sects sponsored by the radical left party
Synaspismos and by the Franco-Italian axis, and on the other was
Genoa 2001, involving the Greek Socialist Workers Party and the
Greens, and linked to the Greek trade union federation. The result of
a bitterly contested preparatory process was the smallest ESF to
date, where even the large concluding demonstration was marred by a
row over the order of march that saw violent attacks by Greek Social
Forum &#8220;stewards&#8221; on the anti-war contingent.</p>

<p>None of this stopped the dominant forces in the ESF process from
proclaiming Athens a success. But the difficulties that they have
faced in finding a viable national coalition willing to host the
fifth ESF were symptomatic &#8211; it took till April 2007, nearly a year
after Athens, to reach agreement that the next Forum will take place
in Scandinavia in September 2008, and even then the venue &#8211; either
the Danish capital, Copenhagen, or the Swedish city of Malm&#246; &#8211;
remains undecided. No wonder attendance at European Preparatory
Assemblies has dwindled, as many participants have voted with their
feet, leaving the Franco-Italian hard core and their hangers on to
dominate. Despite the growing evidence of crisis, however, this group
has, ever since the London ESF, responded by seeking organisational
solutions, reflected by a growing obsession with &#8220;methodology&#8221;
that has spawned yet more all-European meetings and thereby made the
decision-making process even more opaque and unaccountable.</p>

<p>The same preoccupation with procedure was evident in the faction
fight inside Attac, where the leaders of the opposition (many of
them, such as Pierre Khalfa, prominent in the ESF process) made what
Wintrebert calls the &#8220;important &#8216;strategic&#8217; error&#8221; of arguing
that &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t fundamental problems that divided the leading
members [of Attac], but only a problem of the &#8216;style of
leadership&#8217;.&#8221; This conceded the initiative to Nikonoff and
Cassen, who were much more willing to introduce political issues,
such as their defence of French republican &#8220;laicity&#8221; against the
Muslim veil. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p>The problems created by this kind of organisational overload were
reinforced by the increasing influence of the conception of the
social forums advanced by Cassen and another of the founders of the
WSF, the Brazilian Chico Whitaker. For them, the social forums do not
belong to a movement, or even the &#8220;movements of movements&#8221;.
Rather, they are &#8220;a socially horizontal space&#8221; where different
actors can converge to discuss and share perspectives. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a>
In particular &#8211; and this is a constant source of puzzlement to
participants in social forums who are uninitiated into these
mysteries &#8211; the international forums don&#8217;t take decisions. This
risks alienating activists who want to be part of the movement&#8217;s
decision-making process and who are often radicalised partly by the
way neoliberalism has hollowed out democratic political forms at
national level. It is also off-putting because it can turn the social
forums into talking shops pure and simple. An interplay between
discussion, decision and mobilisation is the lifeblood of any real movement.</p>

<p>The left within the movement has sought to bypass the problem by
inventing the Assembly of the Social Movements, where different
social movements get together at the end of each social forum and
adopt an action plan of mobilisations. The device immediately
attracted the hostility of Whitaker, Cassen and others on the right
of the movement. Their response has involved celebrating &#8220;diversity&#8221;
by fragmenting social forums around different &#8220;thematic
priorities&#8221;. Thus the fifth WSF in Brazil in January 2005 was
spread along the banks of the river Guiba in Porto Alegre with the
division of the site into 11 distinct &#8220;thematic terrains&#8221;. As we
wrote at the time:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Space A was devoted to autonomous thought, B to defending
diversity, plurality, and identities, C to art and creation, and so
on. The effect was tremendously to fragment the forum. If you were
interested in a particular subject &#8211; say, culture or war or human
rights &#8211; you could easily spend the entire four days in one
relatively small area without coming into contact with people
interested in different subjects. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Even though European activists reacted negatively to that WSF, the
drive to fragment the Social Forums was used to justify the absence
of any unifying events at the Athens ESF. Even figures generally on
the left of the movement gave way to the new cult of diversity. Piero
Bernocchi argued at an European preparatory meeting in Istanbul in
September 2005 that the <em>altermondialiste</em> movement was a
&#8220;rainbow coalition&#8221; that could not take decisions over
priorities. But the very strength of the movement from Seattle
onwards lay in the convergence of different coalitions in a common
struggle against neoliberalism and war. Had the view Bernocchi
expressed in Istanbul prevailed before Florence, 15 February would
never have happened.</p>

<p>Fragmentation reached the level of caricature in Nairobi. Cramped
physical conditions and organisational chaos meant that there was no
repetition of the physical partition into &#8220;thematic terrains&#8221;.
But the official programme concluded with &#8220;big forums of struggles
and alternatives&#8221; meeting separately to discuss 21 different
themes, followed by &#8220;a tree-planting event&#8221;. The left
successfully insisted on ending instead with an unscheduled Assembly
of the Social Movements, which at least agreed on a common schedule
of future mobilisations.</p>

<p>But the assemblies are organised within the prevailing ideology of
autonomous social movements and therefore reflect the weaknesses
already discussed. As in other cases, the method of consensus
decision making tends to ensure the dominance of &#8220;insiders&#8221; with
resources and connections. The agenda and order of speakers are fixed
in advance by meetings that, though theoretically open to all, are
run by veterans and those with the greatest resources and stamina.
There is very rarely any real discussion at the assemblies themselves
&#8211; and never any voting. This rules out the possibility of any
serious popular discussion or development of strategy. They do serve
a real function and represent a sincere effort by those who organise
them to give some coherence to the movement. But they don&#8217;t provide
the kind of democratic decision making the movement needs.</p>

<p>Many activists have grown increasingly impatient with the
fragmentation and drift that have come to prevail. At last year&#8217;s
WSF in Bamako, Mali, Samir Amin of Egypt and Fran&#231;ois Houtart of
Belgium initiated an appeal. It &#8220;aims at consolidating the gains
made&#8221; at the social forums by &#8220;defining and promoting
alternatives capable of mobilising social and political forces. The
goal is a radical transformation of the capitalist system&#8221;. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p>Amin, a leading radical dependency theorist in the 1960s and
1970s, has been a key figure in pressing for a much greater strategic
focus for the anti-capitalist movement:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There is no room for self-congratulation about these
successes [of the movement]. They remain insufficient to shift the
balance of social and political forces in favour of the popular
classes, and therefore remain vulnerable to the extent that the
movement has not moved from defensive resistance to the offensive ...
Progress is and will be difficult. For it implies (i) the
radicalisation of struggles and (ii) their convergence in diversity
... in common action plans, which imply a strategic political vision,
the definition of immediate and more distant objectives (the
&#8220;perspective&#8221; that defines the alternative). The radicalisation
of struggles is not that of the rhetoric of their discourses, but
their articulation of an alternative project with which they propose
to replace the prevailing systems of social power ... convergence can
only be the product of a &#8220;politicisation&#8221; (in the good sense of
the word) of the fragmented movements. This necessity is resisted by
the discourse of &#8220;apolitical civil society&#8221;, an ideology imported
directly from the United States, which continues to exert its
ravages. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Amin, who goes on to criticise &#8220;the theorists of autonomist
currents [who] affirm that we can change the world without taking
power&#8221;, for denying the necessity of a strategic convergence of
struggles, also notes that the Bamako Appeal had &#8220;irritated the WSF
&#8216;Secretariat&#8217;.&#8221; Indeed a seminar on the appeal in Nairobi saw a
fierce clash when Chico Whitaker objected strongly to Trevor Ngwane&#8217;s
critical defence of the appeal and criticisms of the fragmentation
and absence of strategy in the WSF. But it was clear that large
numbers of activists were worried about the lack of direction of the
movement. The response of the WSF international council was to issue
a call for worldwide mobilisations to coincide with the big business
World Economic Forum in January 2008 &#8211; a decision that both
contradicted the ideology of the social forums as simply &#8220;spaces&#8221;
and implied that a summons to action from the stratosphere could
somehow magically give unity and impetus to the movement.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Moving forward</h4>

<p class="fst">It is important not to take too cataclysmic a view of the current
condition of the anti-capitalist movement. Above all, the other side
isn&#8217;t in too good a state. The World Trade Organisation&#8217;s Doha
round, launched in November 2001 and intended radically to deepen
global capitalism&#8217;s reach into national economies and to
demonstrate the unity of the world&#8217;s ruling classes after 9/11, has
run to a halt. True, the anti-capitalist movement can&#8217;t claim the
chief credit for this, which lies with the deep and persisting
divisions between the United States and the European Union and the
emergence of a new bloc of powerful Third World states, the Group of
20. Moreover, both Washington and Brussels are seeking to bypass the
deadlock by negotiating bilateral economic partnership agreements
with individual countries. Nevertheless, the disarray in the World
Bank with Paul Wolfowitz&#8217;s sacking symbolises the larger
difficulties faced by the neoliberal camp.</p>

<p>The plight of the imperialist offensive launched by the Bush
administration after 11 September 2001 is, of course, much more
serious. US failure to impose its will on Iraq led to the
administration&#8217;s defeat in the mid-term elections in November 2006
and goaded Bush into ordering a military &#8220;surge&#8221; that shows no
signs of succeeding. America and its Nato allies are mired in a
long-term guerrilla war in Afghanistan that may prove equally
intractable. There is a crisis of legitimacy for US global hegemony
that will limit Washington&#8217;s ability to exercise &#8220;soft&#8221;
ideological power as well.</p>

<p>A poll of 26,000 people in 25 countries for the BBC World Service
in January 2007 revealed that 73 percent disapproved of the Iraq War,
while &#8220;majorities across the 25 countries also disapprove of US
handling of Guantanamo detainees (67 percent), the Israeli-Hezbollah
war (65 percent), Iran&#8217;s nuclear programme (60 percent), global
warming (56 percent), and North Korea&#8217;s nuclear programme (54
percent)&#8221;. 49 percent of those polled said that the US is playing a
mainly negative role in the world. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a>
This erosion of America&#8217;s global standing has real effects.
Commenting on US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice&#8217;s shift
towards a more compromising position on issues such as North Korean
nukes, the <strong>Financial Times</strong> explained:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Ms Rice has been forced by
America&#8217;s drastically compromised situation in Iraq into making
changes from a position of weakness. &#8220;When you have a hammer,
everything looks like a nail,&#8221; said a former senior diplomat in the
Clinton administration. &#8220;But, because of Iraq, these guys don&#8217;t
have much of a hammer any more&#8221;. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The weakening of US hegemony isn&#8217;t just a consequence of the
ham-fisted arrogance of the Bush administration. It is an achievement
of those who have opposed the global state of exception proclaimed by
Bush after 9/11. Pride of place here must go to the resistance in
Iraq itself, but the international anti-war movement can claim a
share of credit.</p>

<p>Washington&#8217;s descent into the Iraqi quagmire has in turn created
a space in which resistance can develop elsewhere. The most important
case in point here is Latin America, especially in Venezuela and
Bolivia where the interaction between mass movements and political
leaders has produced governments that have begun, in however hesitant
and inconsistent a way, to pursue a logic that breaks with neoliberalism.</p>

<p>None of these very positive features of the present situation
alter or remove the difficulties that we have discussed above. What
they do cast into question is any suggestion that the balance of
forces is shifting decisively to the right or that the cycle of
struggles that began in the mid-1990s is drawing to a close. Even in
Europe, where the movement is in greatest trouble, we are barely a
year away from the massive revolt by French students and trade
unionists that smashed the CPE law reducing the rights of young
workers. The persistence of the neoliberal offensive will undoubtedly
produce more social explosions, particularly if France&#8217;s new right
wing president, Nicolas Sarkozy, carries out his threat to drive
through market &#8220;reforms&#8221;.</p>

<p>The critical issue is that posed by Samir Amin when he asks: &#8220;Does
the World Social Forum benefit popular struggles?&#8221; In other words,
what is the relationship between the anti-capitalist movement as an
organised force and mass resistance to neoliberalism and imperialism?
The honest answer is that is pretty variable and is likely to remain
so. The organisational implosion of the European movement does not
make one especially optimistic about the ESF. If the next forum does
indeed take place in Scandinavia, this will be in a region where
anti-capitalist resistance has been at a comparatively low level
(with the exception of the protests at the Gothenburg EU summit in
June 2001). A Scandinavian ESF will probably be the most right wing
yet, dominated by NGOs and the local branches of Attac.</p>

<p>The same need not be true of the WSF. Even in Nairobi there were,
as we have already suggested, hints of the explosion of energy that
can be generated by the convergence of different movements.
Unfortunately, as we have seen, the dominant forces in the WSF
process are pushing in the opposite direction, and promoting
fragmentation rather than what Amin calls &#8220;convergence in
diversity&#8221;. It is the duty of the left within the anti-capitalist
movement firmly to resist these tendencies. This resistance, however,
needs to be accompanied by an alternative strategy that is informed
by an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the movement
to date.</p>

<p>This understanding has to involve an open break with the ideology
of autonomous social movements. Too often the left has taken its
stand within the framework of that ideology, whether for tactical
reasons or from principled agreement. But a break is required by an
honest appreciation of the interplay between political parties and
social movements. The truth is that cooperation between the two
actually strengthens both. However much retrospect is coloured by
Bertinotti&#8217;s subsequent right turn, the high points of the European
movement at Genoa and Florence were informed by this cooperation,
involving not merely Rifondazione but also smaller parties of the
radical left such as the LCR and the Socialist Workers Party as well
as more radical elements of Italy&#8217;s centre-left Left Democrats.</p>

<p>The same is true at a global level. The peak so far reached by the
WSF took place, not at any of the Porto Alegre Forums, but in Mumbai
in January 2004, infused as it was by both a strong anti-imperialist
consciousness and the movements of India&#8217;s vast poor. But the two
key organisations of the Indian left &#8211; the Communist Party
(Marxist) and the Communist Party of India &#8211; alongside various
Maoist organisations, played a critical role both in making the forum
possible and in restraining themselves from trying to dominate the
forum or competing too openly among themselves.</p>

<p>An honest reappraisal of the relationship between parties and
movements would allow the social forums to play to their strengths.
The two most successful forums &#8211; Florence and Mumbai &#8211; were ones
where opposition to the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; was a dominant theme.
Saying this does not mean returning to the tedious and sterile
argument &#8211; either the war or the &#8220;social question&#8221;. Opposition
to both neoliberalism and war are constitutive themes of the
anti-capitalist movement. But recognition of both the principled
significance and the mobilising power of anti-imperialism needs to be
built into how the social forums operate. This was proved by the
success of last year&#8217;s &#8220;polycentric&#8221; WSF in Caracas, Venezuela.
It was taken for granted among the tens of thousands of mainly Latin
American activists assembled there that the US poses a real and
present threat to the gains being made by movements in Bolivia,
Venezuela and Ecuador. President Hugo Ch&#225;vez echoed many others when
he spoke there of the importance of the movement against the Iraq war
in weakening the US&#8217;s ability to act in what it regards
traditionally as its own backyard.</p>

<p>Yet the Caracas forum also showed up the limitations of the WSF
process. It should have been possible, for example, to launch a very
high profile, high powered campaign from the forum calling on all the
movements round the world to pledge defence of the gains of the
Chavista experience so far. Many present were suggesting it. But
because of the autonomist principles so jealously guarded by the WSF
leadership, no such centralised initiative was taken.</p>

<p>In breaking out of this impasse, it will be necessary to define
precisely what the radical left is within the movement. This is no
simple matter. The big Indian Communist parties, despite the very
positive role they played in the Mumbai WSF, participate in
neoliberal coalitions at the all-India and state levels: the Left
Front government in West Bengal has violently clashed with workers
and peasants in recent months. The sorry record of Rifondazione has
already been discussed. A much more principled organisation, the LCR,
has kept aloof from the anti-capitalist movement as an organisation,
because of its acceptance of a version of the ideology of autonomous
social movements (although individual LCR members such as Christophe
Aguiton, Pierre Rousset and Sophie Zafari have played important roles
in the movement at global and/or European levels).</p>

<p>Documents of the left within the movement tend to espouse versions
of radical reformism. The Bamako Appeal&#8217;s first plank is, &#8220;For a
multipolar world founded on peace, LAW and negotiation&#8221;. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a>
Amin&#8217;s pronouncements are sometimes redolent of nostalgia for the
high tide of Third World nationalism between the 1950s and 1970s:
&#8220;The reconstruction of a &#8216;front of the countries and peoples of
the South&#8217; is one of the fundamental conditions for the emergence
of &#8216;another world&#8217; not based on imperialist domination&#8221;. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a>
Another important figure on the left of the movement, Walden Bello of
Focus on the Global South, shows a similar approach in his calls for
&#8220;deglobalisation&#8221;. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a> Such
formulations do not sufficiently address the reality that confronting
imperialism as a system will require global social transformation
based on the collective power and organisation of the oppressed and
exploited in the North as well as the South.</p>

<p>None of this should prevent cooperation among different forces on
the left seeking to give the anti-capitalist movement a more coherent
and strategically focused direction. Such cooperation is essential.
But it needs to be accompanied by open debate about the nature of the
enemy that we are confronted with and of the alternatives that we
should be seeking. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a> Striking the
right balance between disagreement and cooperation once again
requires a break with the ideology of autonomous social movements.</p>

<p>This ideology conceives social movements as a neutral space
somehow beyond politics. But fighting neoliberalism and war is
necessarily a highly political affair, and nowhere is free of the
antagonisms of wider capitalist society. The development of the
movements necessarily generates political disagreements that cannot
be kept separate from party organisations. The emergence of new
anti-capitalist political formations that are at least partly the
product of movements of resistance &#8211; Portugal&#8217;s Left Bloc, the
Left Party in Germany, Respect in Britain &#8211; shows the extent to
which activists recognise the need for a political voice as part of
the development of opposition to neoliberalism and war.</p>

<p>We believe that the concept of the united front, developed by the
revolutionary Marxist tradition, provides a better guide to building
democratic, dynamic movements than does the model that has prevailed
so far. A united front involves the coming together of different
forces around a common but limited platform of action. Precisely
because they are different, these forces will have disagreements
about political programme; they may also differ over how to pursue
the common actions that have brought them together. But so long as
they come together round limited and relatively specific aims, such
alliances can be politically inclusive and maximise the chances of
practical campaigning agreement. Because they are focused round
action, they can be a testing ground for different tactics and
strategies. This is the way to break movements away from abstract
position taking or sectarian point scoring, so providing a framework
in which political debate and practical organising can fruitfully interplay.</p>

<p>Constructing such united fronts is not easy: it requires
initiative and clear leadership on the one hand, and openness and
humility on the other. But at a time when the anger against
neoliberalism is growing everywhere and so many people are
reassessing their political loyalties, it seems to us that the
anti-capitalist left needs urgently to try such methods if it is to
reach out and connect with its potential audience.</p>

<p>There is unlikely to be agreement between the different tendencies
in the movement in the short or medium term over general political
alternatives. But we can reach constructive agreement on the many
issues &#8211; opposition to neoliberalism and war &#8211; that unite a large
spectrum of forces. It is precisely this kind of unity in action that
many people are looking for in the current situation. Through the
experience of such campaigning, new political coalitions can emerge.
Moreover, the left within the movement, whether revolutionary or
reformist, should working together in order to fight to give the
movement a more strategic and focused direction.</p>

<p>Many of the ideas and arguments of the anti-capitalist movement
have gone mainstream in the seven long years since Seattle.
Neoliberalism has been widely discredited. The world&#8217;s
&#8220;hyper-power&#8221; is in the process of a terrible humiliation in the
Middle East that will have major repercussions for its ability to
intervene and shape geopolitics. In these circumstances the left has
a responsibility to examine the weaknesses as well as the strengths
of the anti-capitalist movement as it has functioned up to now, and
not allow the movement to be trapped in an impasse.</p>
