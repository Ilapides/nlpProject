<p class="fst"><strong>The Age of Innocence</strong><br/>
Dir: Martin Scorsese</p>

<p class="fst">Martin Scorsese is one of the most intelligent and accomplished
film makers alive. So when he directs an adaptation of Edith
Wharton&#8217;s novel <strong>The Age of Innocence</strong> you can be sure it
won&#8217;t be the kind of elegant coffin in which Merchant-Ivory films
suffocate the novels they are based on.</p>

<p>In its way, the story of how the passion Newland Archer (Daniel
Day-Lewis) develops for the unsuitable Ellen Olenska (Michelle
Pfeiffer) is subtly but effectively thwarted by the New York high
society of the 1870s is as brutal a tale as any of the films Scorsese
has made about low life in the city a hundred years later &#8211; <em>Mean
Streets</em>, <em>Taxi Driver</em>, <em>GoodFellas</em>. Only here the
weapons through which a closed and repressive society enforces its
rules are not the gangster&#8217;s fist or knife or gun but the placement
of guests around a table, or notes refusing an invitation, or an
after dinner conversation over cigars. The scene where Archer&#8217;s
wife May (Winona Ryder) reveals to him that she has used a chat at
tea with Olenska to separate the lovers forever is a brilliant
example of this kind of refined brutality.</p>

<p>Scorsese uses the techniques he learned from the <em>avant garde</em>
French film makers of the 1960s and from his other heroes like the
British director Michael Powell &#8211; jump cuts, crane shots, the
sudden enveloping of the screen in one colour &#8211; to reveal a society
tightly bound by elaborate ritual.</p>

<p><em>The Age of Innocence</em> is a superb and fascinating film,
whose opening scenes especially carry a terrific punch, which had me
often laughing with exhilaration. The three principal performances
are excellent. Nevertheless, I found the second half of the film,
which concentrates on Archer&#8217;s and Olenska&#8217;s doomed love affair,
less successful than the first.</p>

<p>One reason for this is that though Scorsese is a very passionate
film director it doesn&#8217;t seem as if sexual passion really engages
his imagination. Sex and love have generally played a fairly
peripheral part in his other films, which usually have been about
conflicts among men. This doesn&#8217;t mean Scorsese is a sexist
director &#8211; on the contrary. Olenska&#8217;s plight as a woman is
depicted with great sympathy. It&#8217;s simply that he isn&#8217;t at his
best handling desire.</p>

<p>There is, however, a deeper difficulty with the film, which can be
brought out by comparing it with two of the films which inspired
Scorsese in making it &#8211; Orson Welles&#8217;s <em>The Magnificent
Ambersons</em> and Luchino Visconti&#8217;s <em>The Leopard</em>. Both of
these are insider&#8217;s views of the decline of an aristocratic
society. This gives these films a note of elegy, the occasional
echoes of which in <em>The Age of Innocence</em> &#8211; which seeks to
revive a dead world from the outside &#8211; are rather artificial.</p>

<p>More importantly, Welles and Visconti were dealing with <em>big</em>
subjects. <em>Ambersons</em> is about the impact of industrialisation
on American society, symbolised by the rise of the motor car.
Visconti&#8217;s reconstruction of Sicilian aristocratic life in the
1860s is even more elaborate than Scorsese&#8217;s &#8211; the ball scene in
<em>The Leopard</em> lasts for an hour in the full version of the film.
But he uses this scene, and the film as a whole, to explore in great
depth a gigantic historical process &#8211; Italy&#8217;s reunification
through a combination of revolutionary struggle from below and
compromise at the top between the old aristocracy and new
bourgeoisie. There is a kind of disproportion, by comparison, between
the technical brilliance of Scorsese&#8217;s film and the sad little love
story it tells.</p>

<p>But, for all that, <em>The Age of Innocence</em> fails only by the
very highest of standards.</p>
