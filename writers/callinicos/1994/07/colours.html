<p class="fst"><b>Three Colours Trilogy</b><br/>
Dir: Krzysztof Kieslowski</p>

<p class="fst">European cinema has been a dull affair these past few years. The
survivors of the New Wave which made European film making so exciting
in the 1960s have fallen silent, or are producing work way below
their best. Once sparkling talents have dimmed, like the
Marxist-turned-Buddhist Bernardo Bertolucci. They have had no real successors.</p>

<p>Or so it seemed, until the films of the Polish director Krzysztof
Kieslowski began reaching the West in the late 1980s. They revealed a
film maker of the first order, with a highly distinctive and very
personal vision of the world.</p>

<p>One way of summing this up is to borrow a remark of the great
Marxist critic Walter Benjamin. He said that the Surrealists in Paris
between the wars offered &#8216;profane illuminations&#8217;. Their art would
take the most banal everyday objects and use them to explore a secret
and subversive world of desire.</p>

<p>Kieslowski&#8217;s films are full of profane illuminations. Our view
of the ordinary world is transfigured by adopting a new perspective
(a fatal car journey is filmed from the angle of one of the back
wheels) or by the use of light (a ray of sunshine breaking through
the clouds transforms a previously dark and dingy room).</p>

<p>Yet while the more radical Surrealists used their illuminations to
show the way in which our desires are confined and repressed by an
unjust society, Kieslowski&#8217;s revelations lead us away from politics
into the personal life. This is very clear in Three Colours, the
trilogy of films he has just completed, which is devoted to exploring
the three great slogans of the great French Revolution &#8211; liberty,
equality and fraternity. But in each case a political idea is
reinterpreted in personal terms.</p>

<p>Thus in <i>Blue</i>, the first and weakest of the three, Julie
(Juliette Binoche) reacts to the death of her husband and daughter in
a car accident by trying to wipe out the past, and cuts herself off
from all human contact. She discovers, however, that the freedom she
is seeking in this way is an illusion.</p>

<p>Similarly, equality in <i>White</i>, recently released in Britain,
turns out too to concern love. The theme seems to be, as the French
saying has it, there is always one who is kissed and one who kisses.
The partners to a relationship are never equal: one partner is always
more dependent on the relationship than the other.</p>

<p>So <i>White</i> starts with Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski), a Polish
hairdresser living in Paris, being divorced by his beautiful French
wife Dominique (Julie Delphy) because he has been impotent ever since
they married. He is the dependent one, emotionally and financially.
By the end, the roles have been reversed.</p>

<p>In fact the film concentrates on the comic tale of how Karol,
destitute and divorced, through a series of adventures and mishaps
manages to return to Poland, and to make his fortune. Along the way
Kieslowski offers a pitiless portrait of Poland since the fall of
Stalinism, a country ruled by Mafia style capitalism, in which we are
told several times, &#8216;224You can buy anything&#8217; (including a corpse,
though that has to be imported from Russia).</p>

<p>Karol&#8217;s money making is, however, all for love&#8217;s sake. He uses
his wealth to fake his own death, and thereby to lure Dominique to
Poland. It is only now that he can consummate their marriage. He says
it&#8217;s because he saw her cry at his funeral. I wonder. Maybe money
was his problem all along.</p>

<p>All this highlights one difficulty with Kieslowski. The ideas he
explores are often, to be frank, banal. But the means he uses to
express them can be extraordinary. The bottom line of <i>Blue</i> is
really nothing more than that everyone needs love, but the final
sequence of the film, which seeks to express this by a series of
shots of the main characters through a distorting lens and using a
blue filter, is remarkable.</p>

<p>The same problem recurs in <i>Red</i>, due to be released in
Britain in the autumn. The idea of fraternity is explored through the
relationship between a young model Valentine (Irene Jacob) and an
embittered retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant).</p>

<p>The basic story has been told often enough by Hollywood, and could
be summed up as Beautiful Young Thing breathes new life into Grumpy
Old Codger. But the central scenes between them are so well done,
with first rate performances by both the principals &#8211; and
especially by Trintignant &#8211; that Kieslowski sweeps the audience
along with him.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard not to see the contradiction between the paucity of
ideas and the formal brilliance in Kieslowski&#8217;s films as a
reflection of the experience of Polish intellectuals of his
generation. Politically involved in the early 1980s when Solidarnosc
was a mass workers&#8217; movement confronting the state, he seems to
have become increasingly disillusioned as the decade wore on.</p>

<p>His resulting retreat into the personal (which is now so extreme
that he says he will make no more films) is therefore part of a
collective tragedy which has denied this most gifted artist access to
ideas that could really stimulate and challenge his work.</p>
