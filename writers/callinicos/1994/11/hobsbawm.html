<p class="fst"><b>Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century 1914&#8211;1991</b><br/>
by Eric Hobsbawm<br/>
<i>Michael Joseph &#163;20</i></p>

<p class="fst">The events of 1989&#8211;91 &#8211; the East European revolutions of 1989,
the end of the Cold War and of the superpower partition of Europe,
the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union &#8211;
plainly marked a watershed in world history. Making sense of the
historical epoch that came to such a sudden and dramatic conclusion
then may be of use in navigating the uncharted waters in which we now
find ourselves.</p>

<p>And who would seem better qualified to perform the task than the
Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm? Now he has turned his attention to
summing up the &#8216;short 20th century&#8217;, 1914&#8211;91. This period can
be subdivided in two. There is first what Hobsbawm calls &#8216;the Age
of Catastrophe&#8217;, the years between 1914 and 1945 which saw the long
European peace of the 19th century descend into war, revolution,
fascism, and depression. The era after 1945, by contrast, was &#8216;welded
into a single pattern by the peculiar international situation that
dominated it until the fall of the USSR&#8217;, the Cold War between the
superpower blocs.</p>

<p>This subdivision serves to highlight the fact that the most
important theme spanning the history of the short 20th century is the
Russian Revolution of October 1917 and its fate. This revolution was
the decisive upheaval of the 1914&#8211;45 &#8216;Thirty One Years War&#8217;.
Its monstrous offspring, the Stalinist regime, was one of the two
chief actors during the Cold War. The historian of this epoch must
therefore be able to offer a cogent account of October and its consequences.</p>

<p>Yet here Hobsbawm&#8217;s own history is peculiarly disabling. He has
been a particularly eloquent defender of the strategy pioneered by
Stalin in the 1930s of building popular fronts uniting the workers&#8217;
parties with &#8216;progressive capitalists&#8217;.</p>

<p>This historical baggage does not mean that Hobsbawm is
particularly dishonest in those parts of <b>Age of Extremes</b>
devoted to the October Revolution and Stalinism. It is more that the
collapse of the political project to which Hobsbawm has devoted his
life seems to have left him with no clear understanding of what went
wrong. Thus we are told it was the failure of the October Revolution
to spread and Stalin&#8217;s personality and the Leninist tradition which
led to Stalinism, without any attempt to weigh the relative
importance of these alleged causes. More generally, Hobsbawm often in
this book falls into what is sometimes a frenzy of equivocation,
apparently bold assertions being so hedged in with qualifications
that the reader sometimes loses track of what is being said. The text
bears signs of excessive haste, with some cases of repetition and an
annoyingly incomplete bibliography.</p>

<p><b>Age of Extremes</b> is by no means all bad. Hobsbawm is
admirably clear about the enormous economic, social, and cultural
transformations wrought by capitalism on a world scale as a result of
the long boom of the 1950s and 1960s. He argues that this &#8216;golden
age&#8217; has been followed by a period of economic crisis comparable in
many ways to the depression of the 1930s.</p>

<p>But where is the world going at the end of the 20th century?
Hobsbawm seems to be struggling through the &#8216;global fog&#8217; which he
says descended on us after the watershed of 1989&#8211;91. The collapse
of the Stalinist order has left Hobsbawm brooding pessimistically on
a future which may end, according to the book&#8217;s concluding
sentence, in &#8216;darkness&#8217;.</p>

<p>One source of this pessimism is a long standing confusion in his
historical and political writings about the relationship between the
working class and the labour movement. Hobsbawm for example claims
that racism has grown thanks to &#8216;the weakening of traditional
socialist labour movements ... since these had been passionately
opposed to such discrimination, and thus damped down the anti-social
expression of racist feelings within their constituency&#8217;. So the
decline of the Communist and indeed of the social democratic parties
has removed a barrier against racism.</p>

<p>The underlying assumption is that the labour movement, the mass
organisations of the trade unions and the reformist parties, was the
bearer of historical progress. As for workers themselves, they are a
raw material which needs to be shaped by these organisations, and
protected against their own ugly passions.</p>

<p>Yet it is arguable that Britain in the past generation has seen,
despite the decline of the Labour Party and the eclipse of the
Communist Party, a weakening of popular racism in its most intense
and organised form (the last real race riot, for example, was in
Notting Hill in 1958). Mass immigration has created a working class
that is often genuinely multi-ethnic. Hobsbawm cannot recognise this
more complex issue because he tends &#8211; as in his famous lecture <i>The
Forward March of Labour Halted</i> &#8211; to equate the decline of a
particular labour movement with that of the working class itself.</p>

<p>Compromised by his own past and unable to see beyond some
historically specific organisational forms, Hobsbawm seems to regard
the world at the end of the 20th century as on the verge of a relapse
back into barbarism. It is an expression of what is undoubtedly a
widespread mood among left wing intellectuals since the fall of
Stalinism. It is certainly of only limited use as a source of
historical understanding.</p>
