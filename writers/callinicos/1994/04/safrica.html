</td>

</table>

<p class="fst">Recent history has seen many abrupt and dramatic political
reversals. But few have been as spectacular as the transformation
South Africa has undergone. In less than five years the ruling
National Party has moved from forcibly defending apartheid, the
system of racial domination it perfected during its four decades in
power, to participating in elections based on one person one vote. As
a result of the constitutional settlement agreed by the NP and the
African National Congress, these two organisations, for many years
literally at war with one another, will serve together in government.</p>

<p>What made the NP, under the leadership of F.W. de Klerk, make this
leap into the dark? Fundamentally, it was the deep crisis in South
African society which confronted de Klerk when he took over the state
presidency in August 1989. On the one hand, the great township
risings of 1984&#8211;86 had shown that the black majority were no longer
prepared to live under apartheid. The state of emergency imposed by
de Klerk&#8217;s predecessor, P.W. Botha, in June 1986 only bought the
regime a little time. By 1989 mass organisation and militancy were reviving.</p>

<p>Underlying the risings of the mid-1980s &#8211; and those before them
in 1976 and 1980 &#8211; was a structural change in the South African
economy. As blacks moved increasingly into skilled blue collar and
white collar jobs, their collective power as workers grew. The
independent trade unions &#8211; organised mainly through the Congress of
South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) &#8211; were a crucial component in
the struggles of the mid-1980s and were the main factor in sustaining
black resistance during the state of emergency.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the political crisis prompted international
capital to pass a vote of no confidence in South Africa. A disastrous
speech by Botha rejecting negotiations with the ANC in August 1985
precipitated the large scale flight of capital. South Africa was
unable to raise the foreign loans needed to finance anything more
than the most miserable growth rate. After taking office de Klerk
quickly grasped that the only way to attract foreign investors back
to South Africa was to achieve a political settlement with the ANC,
the dominant force in the black resistance.</p>

<p>Such a deal would mean dismantling apartheid and conceding one
person one vote. But de Klerk hoped that by seizing the initiative
and taking advantage of a relatively strong bargaining hand &#8211; at
the end of the 1980s the balance of military power was still
overwhelmingly in the regime&#8217;s favour &#8211; he could achieve a
compromise favourable to white big business, his most important backers.</p>

<p>So de Klerk took the world &#8211; and the ANC &#8211; by surprise in
February 1990 by unbanning the main resistance organisations and
freeing Nelson Mandela. In subsequent negotiations the NP pressed for
a constitution which would limit the power of the majority in a
democratically elected parliament by devolving most responsibilities
to the provinces under a federal system, and by requiring a permanent
coalition government of the main parties. Meanwhile, de Klerk at the
very least turned a blind eye to the reign of terror of Inkatha and
its security force allies in the townships &#8211; a campaign which
conveniently put the ANC on the defensive and weakened its local organisations.</p>

<p>Did this strategy work? Yes and no. De Klerk undoubtedly
overplayed his hand, allowing the first round of multi-party talks to
collapse in May 1992 because of his demands for a white veto.
Meanwhile, the violence in the townships caused a backlash among the
black majority. The turning point came in April 1993 when Chris Hani,
the leader of the South African Communist Party and a hero among ANC
militants, was assassinated by the white extreme right.</p>

<p>The huge explosion of popular anger that followed demonstrated
both the extent of the ANC&#8217;s support and its indispensable role in
controlling that anger. Hani&#8217;s murder, says Patti Waldmeir of the
<strong>Financial Times</strong>, &#8216;permanently tilt[ed] ... the balance of
power in the ANC&#8217;s favour.&#8217; De Klerk was forced to accept a
constitutional settlement which on the whole did not give the
entrenched guarantees of white power and privilege for which the NP
had been pressing.</p>

<p>At the same time one reason why white big business is fairly
relaxed about the absence of these guarantees is that they don&#8217;t
seem necessary. Since February 1990 Mandela and the rest of the ANC
leadership have gone out of their way to reassure local and foreign
capital that they do not intend to make any radical social and
economic changes. A survey of 100 top business leaders published in
the Johannesburg <strong>Weekly Mail and Guardian</strong> last December, which
showed that 68 percent backed Mandela as their first choice for
president, suggests that this exercise has been successful.</p>

<p>Moreover, developments since the outline constitution was agreed
in November 1993 seemed to work in the NP&#8217;s favour. The Freedom
Alliance &#8211; a motley coalition of the white extreme right and
various homeland leaders &#8211; decided to boycott April&#8217;s elections.
Behind this strategy was the barely concealed threat of violence &#8211;
by the fascists of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB), possibly
by military sympathisers of General Constand Viljoen, leader of the
Afrikaner Volksfront (AVF) and former chief of the South African
Defence Force, and above all by supporters of the Zulu tribalist
Inkatha Freedom Party.</p>

<p>Opinion polls suggested that Inkatha had minority support even in
Natal where most Zulu speaking Africans live. Nevertheless, Inkatha
has a formidable mass organisation built up with the help of the
security forces and backed by the state apparatus of the KwaZulu
homeland which is controlled by the Inkatha leader Gatsha Buthelezi.
In the months before the elections there were numerous reports of
Inkatha squads, trained and armed by the AVF, being placed throughout
Natal to disrupt the elections.</p>

<p>The ANC leadership reacted to the Freedom Alliance&#8217;s blackmail
by offering them a series of concessions designed to persuade them to
participate in the elections. The new constitution was changed to
give more powers to the provinces, to enhance the power and status of
the Zulu king and to provide for a self governing white &#8216;homeland&#8217;
&#8211; all measures which favoured de Klerk&#8217;s objective of limiting
the power of the black majority in the &#8216;New South Africa&#8217;. The
<strong>Weekly Mail and Guardian</strong> commented, &#8216;For the first time the
NP will now be able to claim some &#8220;victories&#8221; at the negotiating table.&#8217;</p>

<p>Fortunately the black masses have shown how to win back on the
streets what their leaders gave away at the negotiating table. In
early March, with the elections only six weeks away, popular
insurrection brought down President Lucas Mangope of the
Bophuthatswana homeland.</p>

<p>Mangope and his key adviser Rowan Cronje, ex-minister in the
racist white Rhodesian regime, were, as leading members in the
Freedom Alliance, refusing to allow elections in Bophuthatswana. But
what began as a strike by civil servants, afraid that Mangope would
try to steal their pensions, developed into a general uprising for
Bophuthatswana&#8217;s reincorporation into South Africa and
participation in the April elections. Students and other workers
joined the civil servants on the streets.</p>

<p>When his soldiers and policemen mutinied, a despairing Mangope
appealed to Viljoen to save him. Viljoen ordered in several thousand
right wingers mainly from the AWB&#8217;s paramilitary wing. With popular
support, the Bophuthatswana Defence Force fought the fascists off, in
the process killing one AWB &#8216;general&#8217;. The South African Defence
Force was forced to intervene to restore &#8216;order&#8217; but at the price
of Mangope&#8217;s removal and Bophuthatswana&#8217;s reincorporation into
South Africa.</p>

<p>The Bophuthatswana insurrection shows that the far right&#8217;s bluff
can be called. Buthelezi is undoubtedly a more formidable opponent
than Mangope, but sooner or later his bullying and butchers are going
to have to be faced up to &#8211; almost certainly with force &#8211; if
South Africa is to have any sort of democratic future. But the rising
contained an even more fundamental lesson. Once again it has been the
black workers and youth who have forced the pace of change &#8211; as
they did throughout the 1980s and again after Hani&#8217;s assassination.
When will they get a political leadership which builds on their power
and courage rather than seeks to restrain them?</p>
