<p class="fst">The world seemed to stand still when South Africa went to the
polls in April. Tens of millions of black people voted for the first
time in their country&#8217;s history. Their action, and the victory of
the African National Congress under Nelson Mandela to which it led,
seemed to be the culmination of decades of bitter struggle against
apartheid. It was all the more remarkable as Mandela himself had
spent nearly 27 years languishing in jail, finally released by the
apartheid regime in February 1990.</p>

<p>Voting for the ANC was far more than a symbolic act. For the black
masses it was an affirmation of the demands that had driven forward
the decisive battles of the 1980s &#8211; for jobs, housing, education,
in sum, for a better life.</p>

<p>The most striking thing about the nine months since the election
is how few and tiny the steps the new ANC government has taken
towards realising these demands. ANC leaders seek to justify the slow
pace of change by arguing that they came to power as a result of a
compromise with the established order, and that consequently they
have little room for manoeuvre.</p>

<p>It is true that, in line with the constitution agreed between the
ANC and the apartheid regime, Mandela presides over a coalition
government including representatives of the old order. One of his
deputy presidents is FW de Klerk, leader of the National Party, the
party of apartheid. The home affairs minister is Chief Gatsha
Buthelezi, leader of the tribalist Inkatha Freedom Party, who wants
to stop democratic local elections taking place in his KwaZulu fiefdom.</p>

<p>But the restraints imposed by the coalition are not sufficient to
explain the government&#8217;s lacklustre performance. It was ANC MPs who
voted huge salaries for themselves and even larger ones for
government ministers. It was left to the Congress of South African
Trade Unions (COSATU) and Archbishop Desmond Tutu to denounce this
&#8216;gravy train&#8217;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, down below, in the townships and squatter camps very
little has changed. One of the most burning issues is housing. Yet
the ANC dominated national and provincial governments have still to
launch the massive house building programme promised at the election.
One of the few concrete steps was taken recently by Joe Slovo,
housing minister and leader of the South African Communist Party. He
signed a deal with the banks and building societies designed to make
it easier for blacks to obtain mortgages. In exchange he promised
that the state would take responsibility for evicting mortgage defaulters.</p>

<p>This agreement is part of a government assault on what it calls
the &#8216;culture of boycotts&#8217;. During the 1980s massive boycotts of
rates, rents, and electricity bills developed in the townships as
part of the struggle against the regime. Far from attitudes changing
under the new government, the number of boycotters has actually risen
since April!</p>

<p>One of the most defiant groups are ex-combatants belonging to the
ANC&#8217;s military wing, <i>Umkhonto weSizwe</i> (MK). They are
supposed to be integrated into the new South African National Defence
Force. Recently the former commander of MK, Joe Modise, now minister
of defence, dismissed 2,000 of his men and women for protesting
against the conditions under which they are being integrated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a series of investigations into government hit squads
under de Klerk serve as a reminder that the security forces remain,
despite a few ANC figures at the top, essentially those who so
brutally defended apartheid.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the government there are more dubious plans for South
Africa&#8217;s new international role. One NP minister, Dawie de
Williers, wants to set aside a &#8216;sub-region&#8217; where imported toxic
waste can be dumped. The state weapons company Armscor has a similar
plan to earn foreign exchange by offering a remote part of the
Northern Cape as a bomb disposal site.</p>

<p>ANC supporters have attacked these proposals. But they follow from
the logic of the general policy being pursued by the government &#8211;
namely seeking to make South Africa a competitive unit of the world
market. As the fine print on the much touted Reconstruction and
Development Programme &#8211; centrepiece of the ANC&#8217;s promised reforms
&#8211; begins to appear, the continuity between this government&#8217;s
economic thinking and that of its NP predecessor becomes more striking.</p>

<p>One of the best known socialists in the government, former trade
union leader Alec Erwin, has struck a pose as deputy finance minister
little different from a Tory chief secretary to the treasury eager to
cut public spending.</p>

<p>The biggest threat to these policies comes from the ANC&#8217;s most
important support base, the unions. The initial strike wave after the
elections was snuffed out eventually, thanks to the efforts of the
COSATU leadership. The federation&#8217;s congress reaffirmed its
commitment to a partnership with the government and big business. But
more recently there have been some militant strikes, for example by
bus drivers in Johannesburg and municipal workers in Cape Town.</p>

<p>These struggles serve as a reminder that the ANC came to office
thanks to the emergence in the 1980s of a powerful independent
workers&#8217; movement. That movement has, however, been held back by
its commitment to the politics of negotiation and compromise. Those
politics are, however, likely to come under increasing pressure as
the ANC becomes subject to the test of government.</p>

<p>Those who want to realise the hopes raised in April will have to
look elsewhere &#8211; to those such as the SWP&#8217;s fast growing sister
organisation, the International Socialists of South Africa, who are
seeking not a compromise with the old order, but its overthrow.</p>
