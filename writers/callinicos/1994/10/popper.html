<p class="fst">The death last month of the philosopher Sir Karl Popper was
followed by a series of particularly misleading obituaries. One of
his former pupils, David Miller, called him &#8216;the most important
philosopher of the 20th century&#8217;, which he certainly wasn&#8217;t. For
Jonathan RÃ©e of <b>Radical Philosophy</b>, who ought to know better,
Popper was &#8216;the first and best of the postmodernists&#8217; &#8211; hardly
a helpful description since no one can agree what this label means or
even whether it should be used at all.</p>

<p>Probably Popper will be remembered for one book, <b>The Open
Society and its Enemies</b> (1945). The last two German chancellors,
for example &#8211; the social democrat Helmut Schmidt and the
conservative Helmut Kohl &#8211; have both praised him as the philosopher
of the &#8216;open society&#8217;, by which he really meant modern liberal
capitalist society.</p>

<p>He tried to show how its enemies &#8211; above all, Plato, Hegel and
Marx &#8211; had, over more than 2,000 years, sought to construct a
closed, totalitarian society which crushed the individual. Hardly
surprisingly, Popper has been popular among Russian and East European
intellectuals influenced by the vogue for the ideas of the free
market right that accompanied the collapse of Stalinism.</p>

<p>It would be a pity if Popper&#8217;s reputation were to rest on <b>The
Open Society</b>. Critics long ago demolished the sections of the
book devoted to Plato and Hegel. It has been many years since serious
students of these philosophers paid any attention to Popper&#8217;s
criticisms. The section on Marx is a strange mixture of dogmatism,
muddle and occasional insight. It is almost charming how Popper will
from time to time interrupt his ranting about Marx&#8217;s
totalitarianism, historicism and other crimes, actually read what
Marx says, and acknowledge, slightly bemused, that he held views
often the opposite of those attributed to him in the rest of the book.</p>

<p>Popper&#8217;s real importance lies in the fact that he was a great
philosopher of science. His <b>Logic of Scientific Discovery</b>
(1935) was genuinely path breaking. In it he demolished the
traditional empiricist view of science as the gradual accumulation of
secure facts. Popper first showed that even the most straightforward
observation contains an irreducible element of theory. Secondly, he
argued that science progresses through the formulation of &#8216;bold
conjectures&#8217;, which may not be based on &#8216;facts&#8217; but which can
be put to some kind of experimental test. This process, moreover,
will never end in the attainment of some final truth.</p>

<p>This account provided Popper with a criterion for demarcating
science from non-science &#8211; falsification. A theory is scientific,
he claimed, to the extent that it opens itself to potential
falsification by experience. Though Popper sought to give this claim
a rigorous logical formulation, his search for a demarcation
criterion had political roots. He argued that neither of the theories
which most influenced intellectuals in his native Vienna during his
youth between the wars &#8211; Marxism and psychoanalysis &#8211; was
falsifiable. Both, therefore, were pseudo-sciences &#8211; another idea
which helped make Popper&#8217;s name during the Cold War.</p>

<p>Popper also tried to develop an alternative social science to
Marxism, based on &#8216;methodological individualism&#8217;, which denied
that society can be understood in terms of structures (like
capitalism), but only on the basis of the individuals composing it.
This argument is the ancestor of Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s notorious
claim that &#8216;society doesn&#8217;t exist&#8217;.</p>

<p>A series of major debates among philosophers of science in the
1960s and 1970s established that falsifying scientific theories is a
far more complex business than Popper had imagined. His most talented
pupil, Imre Lakatos, who had also been taught by the great Hungarian
Marxist Georg Lukacs, came up with a far more satisfactory version of
Popper&#8217;s ideas. But Lakatos also showed that in their original form
&#8211; he had in mind especially Popper&#8217;s insistence that theories can
never be shown to be true, but only falsified by experience &#8211; these
ideas could easily merge into the sceptical idea that objective
knowledge of the world is unattainable.</p>

<p>Popper himself remained content to remain aloof from these debates
and basked in the praise of politicians and scientists unaware of the
philosophical difficulties his views involved. His later writings
sometimes assumed a megalomaniac tone, as he claimed to have
definitively solved one or other of the basic problems of philosophy.
He devoted much effort to the futile task of trying to show that
there is a fundamental difference between the mind and the brain,
pursuing the old idealist fantasy of a soul that somehow lurks within
the human body.</p>

<p>Even most of his critics were, however, prepared to concede to
Popper the honour of having &#8216;refuted&#8217; Marxism. Yet there is a
paradox here. In practice it has been Marxists who have taken the
problem of whether their theories are supported by empirical evidence
far more seriously than mainstream social scientists. Thus the
revolutionary left has engaged in lengthy debates since the Second
World War over the development of modern capitalism and the class
nature of the Stalinist societies. By contrast orthodox neoclassical
economics (on which Popper based his &#8216;methodological
individualism&#8217;) has evolved into a series of arcane mathematical
formalisms each successive version of which is further removed from
the actual behaviour of capitalist ironies. It would be ironic if
Marxists turned out to be the best Popperians &#8211; though they would
do so while integrating the genuine insights Popper offered into the
nature of science, into a philosophy and a theory of society
radically different from the rather crude version of liberalism he
sought endlessly to defend.</p>
