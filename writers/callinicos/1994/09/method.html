<p class="fst"><b>The Final Solution: Origins and Implementation</b><br/>
Ed: David Cesarani<br/>
<i>Routledge &#163;35</i></p>

<p class="fst">The Nazi extermination of the Jews still presses at the limits of
human imagination and understanding. Steven Spielberg&#8217;s outstanding
film <i>Schindler&#8217;s List</i> has, among other things, served to
give particularly powerful shape to the old question: how could human
beings have carried out so appalling a crime?</p>
<p>The difficulty has always been that the Holocaust was not
primarily the result of an uncontrollable outburst of hatred, like
the pogroms suffered by Jews in Tsarist Russia at the beginning of
the century. There were episodes in the Holocaust that resembled
these. For example, Dina Porat&#8217;s essay in this collection shows
that, of the 230,000 Jews living in Lithuania when the Germans
invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, perhaps 8,000 were still alive
when the Russian army reoccupied the area three years later. The rest
died in a series of massacres very soon after the invasion, in which
Lithuanian anti-Semites seem to have played a larger part than the
<i>Einsatzgruppen</i>, the SS death squads.</p>

<p>But most Jews died as a result of a deliberate bureaucratically
organised process run by the SS. First came the mass shootings and
gassings practised by the <i>Einsatzgruppen</i> in the wake of the
German armies as they drove through the western and southern Soviet
Union in 1941&#8211;42. Then followed the mounting of murder by assembly
line in the gas chambers.</p>

<p>One major reason for the switch from mass shootings to gas
chambers as the means of extermination was the psychological damage
which SS leader Himmler feared the shootings could cause the
executioners. In December 1941, Richard Breitman tells us, &#8216;Himmler
suggested social gatherings in the evening as a way of reinforcing
camaraderie, but warned against the abuse of alcohol on such
occasions. A good meal, good beverages and music would take the men
&#8220;to the beautiful realm of German spirit and inner life&#8221;.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Holocaust was, then, a carefully planned affair. One major
controversy among historians of the Third Reich has concerned just
how much planning was involved.</p>

<p>Some argue that the doings of the regime were the result of a long
term strategy which could be traced back to the will of Hitler
himself. Others see the National Socialist state as one of warring
bureaucracies, in which Hitler was more the arbiter than the tyrant.</p>

<p>This debate spills over into another, about when the decision to
exterminate the Jews was taken. Did it pre-date the invasion of
Russia? Did it roughly coincide with the invasion, in the summer of
1941, as the <i>Einsatzgruppen</i> fanned out into the USSR?</p>

<p>Or did the Final Solution emerge later, less through deliberate
decision than as a result of a piecemeal process, in which the
initiative was taken less by Hitler than by empire building SS barons
like Himmler and Heydrich, the secret police chief? The absence of
any &#8216;F&#252;hrer order&#8217; in which Hitler explicitly commanded the
Holocaust makes this a subject on which speculation can enjoy pretty
free rein.</p>

<p>What light do the essays collected in this volume shed on our
understanding of the Holocaust?</p>

<p>Some are very useful. Christopher Browning relates the Nazis&#8217;
moves towards the Final Solution to the fortunes of war on the
Eastern Front. He argues that in mid-July 1941, &#8216;convinced that the
military campaign was over and victory was at hand, an elated Hitler
gave the signal to carry out accelerated pacification and &#8220;racial
cleansing&#8221; of Germany&#8217;s new &#8220;Garden of Eden&#8221;.&#8217;</p>

<p>The <i>Einsatzgruppen</i> were expanded and given orders to extend
their previously selective massacres of Jews into full scale
genocide. Then in September/October 1941, another moment of German
victories, Hitler authorised the deportation of the European Jews to
the east, and construction of the killing centres.</p>

<p>This analysis is helpful because it dovetails in with the main
theme of the essays by J&#252;rgen F&#246;rster, Christian Streit and Omer
Bartov. They all stress that Operation Barbarossa &#8211; the invasion of
Russia &#8211; was, as F&#246;rster puts it, &#8216;an ideological war of
extermination&#8217;, waged to win German imperialism &#8216;living room&#8217;
in the east by conquering and enslaving inferior Slav races.</p>

<p>For the Nazis the Stalin regime was the stronghold of &#8216;Jewish
Bolshevism&#8217;, the embodiment of all they hated. Regular German
troops as well as the SS were imbued by National Socialist ideology,
and saw themselves waging a race war in which no quarter would be given.</p>

<p>It was in this frenzied atmosphere that the first massacres of
Jews took place, and that the Holocaust could be seen as an
acceptable &#8216;solution&#8217;.</p>

<p>This conclusion is important. The extermination of the Jews arose
from the imperatives of Nazi ideology. At the heart of this ideology
lay a particular virulent form of racism. Racism is still with us.
New holocausts are still possible. The fight against all that Hitler
stood for goes on.</p>
