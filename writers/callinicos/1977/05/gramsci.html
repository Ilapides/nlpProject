<p class="fst">Two books published earlier this year are important contributions to our understanding of Gramsci. Alastair Davidson, <strong>Antonio Gramsci: Towards an Intellectual Biography</strong> (Merlin &#163;3.00), is probably the best political study of Gramsci available in English, although for the background it assumes read Cammett or Fiori (see below) Antonio Gramsci, <strong>Selections from the Political Writings 1919&#8211;1920</strong>, Lawrence and Wishart &#163;3.00), include many of the articles he wrote in <strong>L&#8217;Ordine Nuovo</strong> during the Turin factory councils movement of 1919&#8211;20. Lawrence and Wishart have already published the excellent <strong>Selections from the Prison Notebooks</strong> (&#163;2.50) and this summer are bringing out another selection of Gramsci&#8217;s political writings covering the years 1920&#8211;6, including presumably the crucial <em>Lyons Theses</em> which Chris Harman discusses in his article. We are also promised yet <strong>Further Selections from the Prison Notebooks</strong> at the end of the year, so most of Gramsci&#8217;s important writings will soon be available in English.</p>

<p>Two books from Pluto Press provide much of the background to the Turin movement. <strong>The Occupation of the Factories: Italy 1920</strong> (&#163;2.40) by Paolo Spriano, a leading Italian Marxist historian, is indispensable for anyone who is interested in one of the most important working-class revolts of the 20th century. Sadly, it has been neglected since the publication of the English translation two years ago, which suggests how little Gramsci&#8217;s self-styled followers care for the central experience that shaped his thought. Gwyn Williams, <strong>Proletarian Order: Antonio Gramsci, Factory Councils and the Origins of the Communist Party in Italy 1911&#8211;1921</strong> (&#163;3.30), is full of fascinating insights, although the author&#8217;s oddities, Maoist and otherwise, often obtrude.</p>

<p>John Cammett&#8217;s <strong>Antonio Gramsci and the Origins of Italian Communism</strong> (Stanford &#163;2.00) was the first book-length political study of Gramsci to appear in English, and is thorough and accessible. Guiseppe Fiori&#8217;s <strong>Antonio Gramsci: The Life of a Revolutionary</strong> (NLB) is valuable as a personal biography, although its attempt to present Gramsci as a precursor of the Popular Front is more questionable (see Lucio Colletti&#8217;s review, <em>Antonio Gramsci and the Italian Revolution</em>, <strong>New Left Review</strong> 65). Carl Boggs <strong>Gramsci&#8217;s Marxism</strong> (Pluto &#163;1.80) is a useful though slightly academic introduction, once account is taken of Boggs&#8217; tendency to overstress the importance of ideological struggle in comparison to political and economic struggle in an attempt to present Gramsci&#8217;s concept of hegemony as a precursor of Maoist cultural revolution. An excellent critical discussion of Gramsci&#8217;s thought, is Perry Anderson <em>The Antinomies of Antonio Gramsci</em>, <strong>New Left Review</strong> 100.</p>

<p>Finally, still in print is a pamphlet published by the Institute of Workers&#8217; Control containing a selection of articles by Gramsci from the 1919&#8211;20 period entitled <strong>Soviets in Italy</strong>. At 20p it&#8217;s a bargain.</p>
