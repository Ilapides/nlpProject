<p class="fst">GEOFF ROBERTS&rsquo; reproaches against the SWP can be summed up
very briefly. Obsessed with staging a rerun of the Bolshevik
revolution of 1917 in the very different conditions of contemporary
Britain, we await some catastrophic economic crisis to galvanise the
masses into revolutionary action with us at the head. This leads us
to ignore the political and ideological conditions that secure the
hold of the ruling class over the minds of the masses, and so to
denounce as reformism the Communist Party&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gramscian&rsquo;
strategy aimed at breaking this hold.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Economics, Politics and the Crisis</h4>

<p class="fst">ON this account, ours is &lsquo;the politics of catastrophe&rsquo;:
the blind workings of the capitalist economy will inevitably bring
about its own collapse and thus provide us with a short cut to
revolution. Roberts offers little evidence to support his
interpretation of the SWP&rsquo;s political strategy, which is not
surprising, since there is none. The following passage, from a
discussion in the last issue of this journal of the difficulties
facing the capitalist world economy, amounts to the complete
rejection of &lsquo;the politics of catastrophe&rsquo;</P>
<P>and it is only one example among many in SWP publications:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;This analysis is not an invitation to sit down and
await the inevitable collapse of capitalism. If workers will pay the
price &ndash; the massive increases in unemployment and in the rate
of surplus-value necessary to offset the decline in the rate of
profit &ndash; then the system can recover temporarily.&rsquo; <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Perhaps Roberts would explain this passage away as an example of
the &lsquo;sane&rsquo; Callinicos as opposed to the (presumably)
&lsquo;insane&rsquo; Tony Cliff. But, before dealing with the article
by Cliff which is the only evidence of our &lsquo;catastrophism&rsquo;
that Roberts offers, let us deal with the allegedly &lsquo;reductionist&rsquo;
and &lsquo;mechanistic&rsquo; interpretation of historical
materialism that Duncan Hallas and I share with Cliff and which
underlies, apparently, the SWP&rsquo;s political strategy. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></P>
<P>We are accused of operating with an &lsquo;analytical model&rsquo;
that denies to consciousness, which embraces &lsquo;the institutions
and practices of the superstructure &ndash; the domains of politics,
ideology and culture&rsquo;, its autonomy. Hence our &lsquo;catastrophism&rsquo;,
and everything else wrong with our politics &ndash; economism,
workerism, rank-and-filism, insurrectionism.</P>
<P>To say, as we do following Marx, that the economy exercises a
determining role over politics and ideology is very far from denying
the latter any autonomy. What it does mean is that the <I>nature</I>
of the superstructure will be determined by the relations of
production. To quote Marx:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;It is always the direct relationship of theowners
of the conditions of production to the direct producers &ndash; a
relation always naturally corresponding to a definite stage in the
methods of labour and thereby its social productivity &ndash; which
reveals the innermost secret, the hidden basis of the entire social
structure, and with it ... the corresponding specific form of the
state.&rsquo; <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The relationship between lord and peasant, capitalist and worker
in the process of production, shapes politics and ideology into a
particular form appropriate to the prevailing mode of production. In
this way, the economy sets limits to the autonomy of the
superstructure. The impact of economic development upon society may
be distorted, displaced or delayed as a result of the functioning of
the superstructure, but they will nonetheless exercise a determining
role.</P>
<P>In any case, if our version of historical materialism is
&lsquo;mechanistic,&rsquo; &lsquo;reductionist&rsquo;, and what have
you, what alternative does Roberts offer? He confines himself to
protesting against Hallas that he never denied that there is a
&lsquo;connection between <I>social being</I> and <I>social
consciousness</I>&lsquo;. What this relationship is we are never
informed. But in any case, no bourgeois sociologist would deny that
the economy, ideology and politics are <I>connected</I>. What he
would reject is the fundamental thesis of Marxism, that the relations
of production <I>determine</I> the rest of society. His reasons would
be little different from those Roberts offers when attacking SWP&rsquo;s
&lsquo;economism&rsquo; &ndash; that concentration on the vulgar
economic struggle of workers for their material interests means
ignoring the important things in life &ndash; the spiritual realm of
ideas on which the academic sociologists and economists who make up
so many of the CP&rsquo;s new theoreticians subsist.</P>
<P>The determining role of the economy means that any serious
revolutionary strategy must start from, and integrate into its
political analysis, an understanding of the situation of the
capitalist economy. If the present crisis is merely a temporary
problem which comparatively minor adjustments can resolve, then there
is nothing to prevent the curve of capitalist development resuming
the upward movement it described during the boom of 1950s and 1960s.
A return to the conditions of the boom would mean that capitalists
could afford the increases in real wages that provided the material
basis for the political passivity of workers in the advanced
capitalist countries during the post-war years.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, as we argue, the capitalist system on a
world scale is entering a period of crises unparalled since the 1920s
and 1930s, then the political possibilities are quite different. In
this case, workers will be faced with theprospect of mass
unemployment, galloping inflation and falling living standards as a
continuing feature of the system. The material basis for reformism
will be undercut.</P>
<P>Of course, the latter alternative will not automatically lead to
workers swarming into the ranks of the SWP, or any other would-be
revolutionary party. Whether they do or not at a time of deep crisis
will depend on the implantation and activity of revolutionaries
within the working class. This is the point argued by Cliff in the
article which Roberts produces as evidence of our &lsquo;catastrophism&rsquo;.
In the conditions of mass unemployment on a 1930s scale described by
Cliff (quite a likely prospect in the medium term, given the weakness
of British capitalism), then, in the absence of a sizeable
revolutionary party, workers will be attracted, not to the left, but
to the fascist and Tory right. The conculsion Cliff draws is not that
we should passively await inevitable catastrophe; but of the urgent
need to start on the process of building the revolutionary party
<I>now</I>.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Reformism, Consciousness and Action</h4>

<p class="fst">ALL THIS, Roberts would reply, is irrelevant. The SWP&rsquo;s
economic analysis cannot explain &lsquo;the continued grip of
reformism on the working class in the absence of reforms.&rsquo;</P>
<P>But nothing in our version of historical materialism forces us to
claim that economic changes will be automatically and immediately
reflected in people&rsquo;s heads. Their response to these changes
will take shape within the existing institutions and practices
through which they participate in economic, political and ideological
activity. For British workers, the most important of these
institutions are the mass reformist organisations &ndash; the Labour
Party and the trade unions.</P>
<P>To understand workers&rsquo; response to the crisis it is
necessary to start from their relationship to these organisations.
This involves a concrete analysis rather than the generalities about
hegemony which Roberts deals in.</P>
<P>Neither in his present article nor in <B>Marxism Today</B> does he
offer even the beginnings of such an analysis. Perhaps this is
because it would face him with the embarrassing task of accounting
for the decisive role played by the trade union &lsquo;lefts&rsquo;
(Scanlon, Jones, etc.) in the &lsquo;overall political shift to the
right&rsquo; that has taken place under the present Labour
government. Their role results, not from the wickedness or treachery
of the individuals involved, but of the very considerable specific
weight of the trade union bureaucracy as a distinct conservative
layer within the workers&rsquo; movement. I shall not repeat Duncan
Hallas&rsquo; arguments <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> here although it is worth saying that
Roberts&rsquo; failure to reply to them is extremely revealing. His
excuse for this failure &ndash; the allegedly obvious &lsquo;weakness&rsquo;
of the Hallas article &ndash; is very unconvincing: it is more likely
that he was unable to answer the points Hallas makes.</P>
<P>In any case, Roberts seems to imply, industrial strategy is really
rather unimportant. What really matters is the &lsquo;battle ... to
break ruling-class hegemony and to, simultaneously, develop (<I>sic</I>)
a new working-class hegemony &ndash; the basis for a consent to a new
social order&rsquo;.</P>
<P>This so-called &lsquo;Gramscian strategy&rsquo; is counterposed to
the economic class struggle, the trade union struggle for higher
wages, etc, with which the economist SWP is obsessed. Roberts is
emphatic that the battle on the terrain of &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;,
by which he seems to mean politics and ideology, takes priority over
the economic class struggle: &lsquo;In the first instance at least,
the power of the ruling class does reside in the ballot box and what
is required, above all, is a strategy capable of challenging that
power.&rsquo; Now we certainly do place priority on the struggle at
the point of production. We do so not because of all the &lsquo;isms&rsquo;
we are allegedly guilty of (economism, reductionsim etc.) but because
of the role of that struggle in <I>changing workers&rsquo;
consciousness</I>.</P>
<P>The starting point for Marxism as a revolutionary theory is the
way in which their common exploitation in the process of production
draws workers together and forces them to organise collectively. It
is this collective organisation at the point of production that is
the source of workers&rsquo; strength and of their growing sense of
their existence as a class with the power to transform society.</P>
<P>This is at the centre of Gramsci&rsquo;s thought in particular. He
saw the internal commissions &ndash; the Italian equivalent of the
shop stewards&rsquo; committees &ndash; as the workers&rsquo; state
in embryo. Through the common experience of struggle workers would
begin to develop the organs of power &ndash; Soviets &ndash; that
would form the basis of their state. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></P>
<P>Struggle at the&rsquo; point of production is the focus of our
activity because only there do workers develop a collective
consciousness of themselves as a class. In the other areas, those of
&lsquo;civil society&rsquo;, mentioned by Roberts &ndash; the ballot
box and the community &ndash; workers exist as atomised individuals
or families, participating in these activities under conditions that
deny their existence as a class. This does not imply that these areas
are irrelevant; the SWP participates in a range of activites outside
the confines of the workplace &ndash; parliamentary elections,
abortion campaigns, anti-fascist work, etc. But it does mean that
these activites are subordinated to the struggle in the workplace,
where the hold of bourgeois ideas can be decisively broken.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Parliamentary Democracy and the Capitalist State</h4>

<p class="fst">HOW DO the broader social struggles, whether they are fought in
the factories, or in &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;, relate to the
struggle for political power itself? Contrary to Roberts&rsquo;
claims, our differences here are fundamental ones.</P>
<P><I>The structure of the bourgeois parliamentary state is
incompatible with the exercise by the working class of political
power.</I> All sides in the debate within the CP on the new <B>British
Road to Socialism</B> are agreed on one point, that the transfer of
poltical power to the working class will take place through the
strengthening of the institutions of parliamentary democracy. Roberts
writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;existing representative institutions such as
Parliament are capable, on condition of their reform, of becoming
adequate means through which wokring-class power can express itself.&rsquo;
<a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Yet consider the nature of the parliamentary regime. Like all
capitalist regimes (with the exception of the limiting case in which
the entire national capital is in the hands of what Bukharin called
&lsquo;a single state capitalist trust&rsquo;) it involves the
separation of economics and politics &ndash; representation is
allocated on a geographical rather than an economic basis, and the
function of Parliament is deemed to be the securing of a &lsquo;general
interest&rsquo; above classes. The masses are denied effective
participation in government and are reduced to casting a vote between
different capitalist parties in conditions dominated by the
capitalist-controlled media every four or five years. Parliament
itself once elected is responsible for making laws, not for executing
or interpreting them, which are in the hands of the civil servants
and judges.</P>
<P>The only time the House of Commons did exercise anything
approaching the power the CP would like it to have was between 1846
and 1867. This was in conditions when it was elected on a very
restrictive suffrage and still largely composed of the nominees of
the big landowners. The emergence of a mass electorate after 1867
coincided with the beginning of the decline of Parliament as power
shifted to the Cabinet, the civil service and the big corporations.
This development is a commonplace of bourgeois political science from
Walter Bagehot onwards. The restoration of the sovereignty of
Parliament is a reactionary utopia.</P>
<P>The alternative of soviet power arises from the reality of
workers&rsquo; position within the capitalist process of production.
Only soviets composed of workplace delegates directly reflect the
interests and aspirations of workers at the point of production and
enable them to overcome the separation of politics and economics,
ruler and ruled, executive and legislative, inherent in the
capitalist state.</P>
<P>As to the revolutionary transition to societ power, Roberts&rsquo;
quibbles about whether smashing the state means destroying the Water
Boards is irrelevant. The central problem is that of the repressive
state apparatus. Roberts admits the need to organise soldiers against
the capitalist class. Good (it&rsquo;s more than the French Communist
Party for one will admit). Let&rsquo;s think through what this
implies.</P>
<P>The experience of the Portuguese revolution shows that it is not
enough to rely on &lsquo;progressive&rsquo; army officers to deliver
the goods. Rank-and-file soldiers would have to be organised
independently of their officers, demands that officers would have to
be elected, etc., would be raised. This would challenge the
hierarchical relationships on which the very existence of the
capitalist army depends and provoke a bitter class struggle within
the army. Such a soldiers&rsquo; movement would depend for its
survival on its ability to link up with the mass of workers organised
in soviets and on the arming of the workers to counterbalance the
armed forces &ndash; loyal regiments, special units like the SAS,
special constables, &lsquo;unofficial&rsquo; fascist groups &ndash;
the ruling class would bring to bear.</P>
<P>The result would be the destruction of the capitalist army and
civil war &ndash; a civil war whose bloodiness and outcome would
depend on the strength and determination of the contending sides. It
would not be Parliament but the independent organisation and armed
strength of the working class that would be decisive.</P>
<P>What about the ruling-class attacks on existing democratic rights?
The struggle to defend and extend these rights can be given a
revolutionary content, according to Roberts. Here there is no
quarrel. We would defend even Parliament against a right-wing coup.
The present parliamentary regime provides the framework of democratic
rights which enables the workers to organise comparatively freely.
But the real issue is whether these rights can be defended
effectively within the framework of the parliamentary regime. The
closer the workers&rsquo; movement seems to be to making real inroads
into capitalist power, the stronger the tendencies will be within the
ruling class to reply by naked force and the destruction of workers&rsquo;
organisation, as in Chile. Here again the only effective defence of
democratic rights will be to <I>go beyond</I> bourgeois democracy &ndash;
by arming the workers and forming soviets. It was the revolutionary
initiative of the masses that initially frustrated Franco&rsquo;s
coup in 1936. If it had been left to the parliamentarians of the
governing coalition, his victory would have been child&rsquo;s play;
as it was Franco had to wait for the GPU and their bourgeois
republican allies to eradicate workers&rsquo; democracy before he
could triumph over bourgeois democracy.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>In Conclusion</h4>

<p class="fst">I APOLOGISE to those readers who will be wondering what all the
fuss is about. After all, much of what I have said amounts to little
more than the Marxist ABC &ndash; the determining role of the
economy, the centrality of the industrial working class, the class
nature of bourgeois democracy, the necessity of armed insurrection.
Unfortunately, these basic propositions are ones that need repeating
for the benefit of the Communist Party&rsquo;s new &lsquo;intellectuals&rsquo;.</P>
<P>Roberts&rsquo; sneers about the &lsquo;timeless&rsquo; and
&lsquo;abstract&rsquo; nature of the SWP&rsquo;s politics are little
more than an evasion. In the first place, Marxism involves the
generalisation of the experience of the international working class.
The great events in our history &ndash; the Paris Commune, the
Russian revolutions, the German revolution of 1918-23, the Italian
<I>biennio rosso</I> of 1918-20, the Chinese revolution of 1925-27,
the Spanish revolution of 1936-7 &ndash; have lessons to teach us;
that at least we should have learned from the experience of Chile and
Portugal. Otherwise, why bother to have any theory if it is of no
relevance to our present tasks?</P>
<P>In the second place, despite their trumpeted &lsquo;novelty&rsquo;,
the ideas of Roberts and his co-thinkers on the right of the
Communist Party are very old. They are all to be found in the works
of those leaders of the Second International like Bernstein and
Kautsky who sought long ago to deprive Marxism of its revolutionary
essence. The only slight surprise to find these ideas being advocated
by members of a party founded to overthrow British capitalism as part
of the struggle for an international Soviet republic.</P>
<P>The conception of the revolutionary party as one built through
struggle, which we share with the early Comintern, is dismissed by
Roberts as &lsquo;exclusivist&rsquo; and &lsquo;vanguardist&rsquo;.
As usual, these labels (yet more &lsquo;isms&rsquo;) substitute for
arguments. I shall not argue at length for our conception of the
party, which Hallas and I dealt with in our earlier articles, and to
which Cliff has devoted the two volumes so far published of his study
of Lenin.</P>
<P>Very briefly: if Lenin was right when he said that &lsquo;revolution
is impossible without a change in the views of the majority of the
working class, a change brought about by the political experience of
the masses, never by propaganda alone&rsquo; <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>, then the
revolutionary party can only be built through its participation in,
and leadership of, the day-to-day struggles through which workers
acquire this experience. This means, far from &lsquo;exclusivism&rsquo;,
as <I>open</I> an atitude as possible. We have shown repeatedly in
practice our readiness to work with anyone prepared to fight all
attacks on workers&rsquo; organisations and living standards. The
Right to Work Campaign has involved many rank-and-file Labour and
Communist Party members as well as SWP members.</P>
<P>What is the alternative presented by the Communist Party? The
abandonment of any independent role for the CP in the new British
Road is little more than a codification of existing practice. It is
now too closely wedded to the trade union bureaucracy to take
independent initiatives. Events in the last few months have confirmed
this beyond any shadow of doubt &ndash; the retreat by Communist
stewards from the initial calls to action against the Social Contract
in February this year and the strike-breaking role of the CP at
Leyland and Heathrow. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></P>
<P>Long after the CP ceased to be the party of world revolution in
Britain it united a community of trade union militants that gave it
an importance out of proportion to its size and electoral weight.
Today it seems to be abandoning even this more modest role. The
&lsquo;hegemonic action&rsquo; which Roberts wishes to put in its
place amounts to little more than contesting elections, the arena to
which, as we have seen, he gives priority. There seems to be little
left to the Communist Party except propaganda. Bert Ramelson, the CP
industrial organiser, made exactly <I>one</I> practical proposal in a
recent pamphlet on the Social Contract written at a time when
opposition to wage controls had become a burning issue for many
rank-and-file workers:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;I invite you to study and discuss with us our
basic draft programme, <B>The British Road to Socialism</B>, and to
join our Party.&rsquo; <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Nothing about the present wave of struggles against the Social
Contract (not surprising perhaps since the CP opposed the most
important of them). Nothing about the fight against Phase Three &ndash;
not even a call for resolutions in union branches. And Roberts has
the nerve to accuse <I>us</I> of propagandism and &lsquo;exclusivist&rsquo;
party building!</P>
<P>Of course, the CP could still prove us wrong. Roberts concludes
his article with the customary obeisances to left unity. If the CP is
genuinely committed to action against the Social Contract and the
other anti-working-class policies of the present government, then let
it respond to the call made last November by the Right to Work
Campaign and supported by the SWP for joint action by the Campaign
and the CP-dominated LCDTU and Assembly on Unemployment. Unity <I>in
action</I> is the only meaningful form of left unity.</p>
