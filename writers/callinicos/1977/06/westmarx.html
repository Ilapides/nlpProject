<p class="fst"><B>Considerations on Western Marxism</B><BR>Perry Anderson<BR><I>NLB
&pound;4.50</I></P>
<p class="fst">THE aim of this short and pricey book is ambitious: nothing less
than a general overview of &lsquo;Western Marxism&rsquo;, by which
Anderson means the collection of intellectuals widely influential on
the European left since the Second World War, and particularly since
the revival of anti-Stalinist Marxism in the 1960s. In this group he
includes such diverse figures as Lukacs, Gramsci, Korsch, Benjamin,
the Frankfurt school, Della Volpe, Colletti, Lefebvre, Sartre,
Goldmann and Althusser.</P>
<P>Anderson argues that despite their diversity all these thinkers
represent a common response to the failure of the Russian revolution
to spread to the West after the First World War, and the consequent
suffociation of Marxism by Stalinists, fascism, and social-democracy.
The &lsquo;Western Marxists&rsquo; reacted by flying from active
involvement in the class struggle to a preoccupation with philosophy,
and indeed with idealist philosophy divorced from practice in a way
that the classical Marxists, from Marx himself to Lenin, Luxemburg
and Trotsky, would have violently rejected. Only today, Anderson
concludes, with the revival of workers&rsquo; struggles and of the
revolutionary movement in the advanced capitalist countries, can
Marxist theory be integrated into the class struggle again.</P>
<P>In these very general and bald terms; there is a lot to be said
for this interpretation of &lsquo;Western Marxism&rsquo;. And
certainly the erudition that Anderson deploys in its support is
impressive. However, one suspects that, just because of its
generality, the argument would be a lot less impressive when
confronted with the detail of any particular &lsquo;Western
Marxist&rsquo;s&rsquo; thought (this suspicion is confirmed in the
case of the &lsquo;Western Marxist&rsquo; whose work I know best,
Louis Althusser &ndash; Anderson quite simply gets some of his
central theses wrong.)</P>
<P>A more serious problem is that the essay seems as much as anything
else to be a self-criticism, although this is never made explicit.
After all, Anderson, as editor of <B>New Left Review</B>, has more
than anyone else been responsible for making these ideas and the
works of the &lsquo;Western Marxists&rsquo; available to English
readers. Moreover, Anderson himself in many ways fits the description
of a &lsquo;Western Marxist&rsquo;. On taking over <B>NLR</B> in the
early 1960s Anderson and his associates launched an ambitious new
reinterpretation of British history since the Civil War based on some
of the ideas of Lukacs, Gramsci and Sartre and avowedly idealist (see
his article <I>Socialism and Pseudo-Empiricism</I>, <B>NLR 35</B>).
This interpretation was demolished by E.P. Thompson in a celebrated
article, <I>The Peculiarities of the English</I> (<B>The Socialist
Register 1965</B>). Undaunted, Anderson has since widened his sights
even further, launching into an ambitious study of the historical
genealogy of the capitalist state. Two volumes have already appeared,
<B>Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism</B> and <B>Lineages of the
Absolutist State</B>, which seem to owe more to Max Weber than to
Karl Marx.</P>
<P><B>Considerations on Western Marxism</B> cannot, therefore, be
assessed without keeping in mind who wrote it. If anything, Anderson
seems to overreact against his &lsquo;Western Marxist&rsquo; alter
ego, concluding: &lsquo;When the masses themselves speak,
theoreticians &ndash; of the sort the West has produced for fifty
years &ndash; will necessarily be silent&rsquo; (p.106). This
position leads naturally to the abandonment of any attempt to
confront Marxist theory critically. Yet such an attempt is
indispensable if theory is no longer to be divorced from the class
struggle.</P>
<P>Anderson&rsquo;s conclusion is closely linked to his enthusiastic
discovery of an alternative tradition to that of &lsquo;Western
Marxism&rsquo; &ndash; orthodox Trotskyism. Yet if ever there were a
theory, whatever its undoubted strengths, that was in need of
critical examination, it is the one. Of the three figure&rsquo;s
selected as representatives of the Trotskyist tradition, Roman
Rosdolsky is remembered chiefly for his commentary on Marx&rsquo;s
economic writings, which concentrates on explicating and defending
Marx&rsquo;s concepts rather than applying them; Ernest Mandel has
consistently failed to use these concepts to locate the dynamic of
international capitalism in its present phase, instead preferring to
try and fit the world willy nilly into the concepts; and Isaac
Deutscher concluded that the Stalinist bureaucracy that Trotsky
fought for so many years could deliver the goods.</P>
<P>There is a certain logic in all this. Anderson&rsquo;s work has
been conducted at such a high level of abstraction that rather
arbitrary what political line you opt for on the basis of the theory.
So Anderson switched from support for left reformism in the Labour
Party and elsewhere in the early 1960s to advocacy of student Red
Bases as the way to smash capitalism in the late 1960s to Trotskyism
today. The loose fit between abstract and concrete has also meant
that it is as easy to switch theory around as it is practice (or the
lack of it) because it is under no empirical control provided by the
need to relate the theory to the class struggle: so the political
shifts have been matched by largely unexplained philosophical shifts,
from Sartre to Althusser to Colletti. Sloppy theory matches lousy or
nonexistent practice. Even the rejection of &lsquo;Western Marxism&rsquo;
and the enthusiastic and uncritical adoption of revolutionary
practice in the somewhat dubious form of Trotskyism <I>&agrave; la</I>
Mandel involves the same divorce between theory and the class
struggle that Anderson is attacking in &lsquo;Western Marxism&rsquo;.</P>
<P>To his credit, Anderson steps back from his worst excesses. In a
<I>Postscript</I> to the main part of the book, he notes that there
are in fact problems with the &lsquo;classical tradition&rsquo; of
Marx, Lenin and Trotsky. Some of the difficulties he points to
(especially those relating to &lsquo;the economic architecture of
<B>Capital</B> itself&rsquo;) seem to me to be pseudo-problems based
on a failure to understand the thinkers in question. But others &ndash;
and particularly those problems arising from the attempt of Mandel,
etc., to apply Trotsky&rsquo;s theory of permanent revolution and his
analysis of bureaucratic workers&rsquo; states to the world today &ndash;
are very real.</P>
<P>Fred Halliday&rsquo;s interesting review of Livio Maitan&rsquo;s
book on the Chinese cultural revolution in <B>NLR 100</B> (although
his position is very different from ours) suggests that Anderson and
his collaborators may be embarking on what could be a fruitful
attempts to explore these problems. Anderson&rsquo;s article in the
same issue on the greatest of the &lsquo;Western Marxists&rsquo; and
the one who fits his schema least, Gramsci, is perhaps the best thing
he has written. For once Anderson abandons global theorising to
consider a specific problem; the answers he comes up with explode the
Eurocommunist distortions of Gramsci, while by no means sparing the
latter from criticism. Let us hope that these welcome trends in <B>NLR</B>
continue in the future.</p>
