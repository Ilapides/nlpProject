<p class="fst">There is no doubt about what book heads this reading list. Trotsky&#8217;s <strong>History of the Russian Revolution</strong>, republished this autumn by Pluto Press (&#163;5.00), is <em>the</em> book to read on this subject. If you haven&#8217;t already, read it now.</p>

<p>John Reed&#8217;s eyewitness account of the actual seizure of power in November 1917, <strong>Ten Days that Shook the World</strong> (Penguin &#163;1.00), is vivid, exciting, moving. Again it&#8217;s a must.</p>

<p>The second volume of Tony Cliffs <strong>Lenin, All Power to the Soviets</strong> (Pluto &#163;3.60), concentrates on Lenin&#8217;s role in 1917, filling a gap left in Trotsky&#8217;s <strong>History</strong> from which, as Cliff puts it, &#8217;the party, alas, is almost absent&#8217;.</p>

<p>Two other books add to our understanding of Lenin and the Bolsheviks in 1917. The Bolshevik Central Committee minutes for the period August 1917-February 1918, published by Pluto in <strong>The Bolsheviks and the October Revolution</strong> (&#163;2.70), give us the atmosphere of muddle, and argument in which the vital decisions were taken. There is also Marcel Liebman&#8217;s interesting study, <strong>Leninism under Lenin</strong> (Allen Lane &#163;12.00), although its price makes it something to read in a library rather than to buy.</p>

<p>Trotsky&#8217;s autobiography, <strong>My Life</strong> (Penguin &#163;1.25), fills in aspects of his role in 1917 omitted from his <strong>History</strong>. <strong>1905</strong> (Penguin 75p), apart from its account of the first Russian revolution and the first Soviets, contains the finest of Trotsky&#8217;s analyses of the driving forces of the revolution, which provided the basis for his theory of permanent revolution.</p>

<p>The first three volumes of E.H. Carr&#8217;s <strong>History of Soviet Russia, The Bolshevik Revolution 1917-23</strong>, scrupulously assemble many useful facts. Unfortunately, the heart of the matter &#8211; the working class &#8211; is missing.</p>

<p>Victor Serge&#8217;s <strong>Year One of the Russian Revolution</strong> (Allen Lane &#163;3.75) describes the immediate aftermath of the revolution. As to its fate, Chris Harman&#8217;s pamphlet, <strong>How the Revolution was Lost</strong>, is unfortunately out of print. Cliff&#8217;s <strong>State Capitalism in Russia</strong> (Pluto &#163;1.50) is indispensable. For an interesting discussion of the early years of the Soviet state, written from a sophisticated Maoist point of view, read Charles Bettelheim&#8217;s <strong>Class Struggles in the USSR</strong> (Harvester &#163;12.50).</p>

<p>Hopefully Volume 3 of Cliff&#8217;s <strong>Lenin</strong> will fill an important gap &#8211; the international impact of the October revolution. New Park have done a useful service by publishing the proceedings of the vital <strong>Second Congress of the Communist International</strong> (2 volumes, each &#163;3.50).</p>
