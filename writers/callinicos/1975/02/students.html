<p class="fst">THE MODERN student movement in younger even than its members. Ten
years ago there was no student movement to speak of in this country.
In this, Britain was typical of almost all the advanced countries of
late capitalism, East and West. The exceptions were few; in France
the student union had been a lonely centre of opposition to the
colonial war in Algeria; then there was the memory of 1956 when in
Poland and Hungary the students had spearheaded the challenge to the
Stalinist bureaucracies.</P>
<P>The politics of what little student movement existed were firmly
right of centre. In Britain and the US the national student unions
were run by the nominees of the CIA. The most tenacious image of
students among working class militants in Britain even today remains
that of Oxbridge undergraduates scabbing on the general strike in
1926. Trotsky had long ago dismissed the revolutionary potential of
students:&ndash;</p>

<P class="quoteb">&lsquo;The intensification of the struggle between labour
and capital hinder the intelligentsia from crossing over into the
party of labour. The bridges between the classes are broken down and
to cross over one would have to leap across an abyss which gets
deeper every passing day ... this finally means that it is harder to
win the intelligentsia today than it was yesterday and that it will
be harder tomorrow than it is today.&rsquo; <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<P class="fst">These remarks were valid when they were written; this article will
show why it is no longer so.</P>
<P>So much has changed in the last ten years. In the late sixties
massive confrontation between students and the authorities swept
across the world from London to Prague, from Berkeley to Berlin, from
Paris to Tokyo. In their wake they left large numbers of highly
political students who identified actively with some form of
revolutionary Marxism.</P>
<P>Nor was this revolt a flash in the pan. To take the example of
Britain, the National Union of Students now embraces 700,000
students. It sees its primary role that of organising mass campaigns
involving direct action as a way of winning concessions from the
government. Its executive is dominated by the Communist Party
controlled Broad Left and includes a minority of revolutionaries from
the National Organisation of IS Societies. The NUS&rsquo;s
constituent students unions gave massive material and political
support to the miners strike in 1972 and 1974.</P>
<P>British students are on the move again. The last 18 months have
seen a series of revolts unknown since the late sixties. At Oxford,
Essex and Kent in 1973/74 thousands of students found themselves
engaged in bitter battle with the authorities. This involved a
determined effort by the authorities to break the student movement.
Each Vice-Chancellor was keenly aware that he was being watched by
others as to how he dealt with the militants. In the event, large
scale victimisations took place but not before the intervention of
the police and the courts invited by the authorities. At Essex no
less than 105 students were arrested for picketing the university.</P>
<P>The first months of 1974/75 have exceeded anything that took place
in 1968. Thousands of students have occupied their colleges or the
local education offices, boycotted lectures, refused to pay excessive
prices, and other protests. In London 40,000 marched in support of
the NUS grants campaign.</P>
<P>The cuts taking place in education have ensured that students are
going to take direct action on an unprecedented scale.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Students and Late Capitalism</h4>

<P class="fst">WHY HAVE these changes taken place?</P>
<P>Capitalism has always moulded higher education to suit its needs.
But before 1945 higher education was primarily a way of preparing the
children of the ruling class for the exercise of power and of
training members of the middle classes for the liberal professions
and the senior administrative posts that an imperialist power
requires. Of nowhere was this more true than Britain. Other
countries, like Germany and France which has to industrialise in the
shadow of Britain&rsquo;s industrial monopoly, placed more of a
premium on intellectual workers whose skills could contribute to
their national capital&rsquo;s relative competitiveness. Hence the
Ecoles Polytechniques in France and the Technische Hochschulen in
Germany.</P>
<P>Not so Britain. At Oxford and Cambridge the separation of higher
education from the practicalities of running a capitalist economy was
taken to its furthest extreme ... &lsquo;Greats&rsquo; &ndash; the
study of Greek and Roman history and literature &ndash; was seen as
the ideal of a liberal education and the young gentlemen were ridden
with a loose rein. &lsquo;Young barbarians at play&rsquo; Matthew
Arnold had called them in the 19th century and so they remained well
into the 20th century, as the diaries and novels of Evelyn Waugh
testify.</P>
<P>The creation of institutions like the London School of Economics
and the civic universities did not challenge the dominance of
Oxbridge; their role was to provide the personnel for the liberal
professions and the administration of the Empire. The number of
students was small; 25,000 in 1900; 61,000 in 1924; 69,000 in 1939.
They constituted a fairly homogenuous social grouping that, given
it&rsquo;s members origins and the social rule they were intended to
perform, naturally identified politically with the ruling class. The
only significant recruitment of students to the Marxist left in this
country took place in the 1930s under the combined impact of the
slump, the rise of fascism and the adoption by the Comintern of the
strategy of the Popular Front, which made Communism far more
palatable to sections of the bourgeoisie than it had been either in
the immediate aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution or during the
ultra left third period in the late twenties and early thirties. The
political loyalties formed in the thirties proved ephemeral and
wilted with the coming of the Cold War, if not earlier. Denis Healey
was one such Communist.</P>
<P>The demands that capitalism placed on higher education changed
dramatically after the war. The stabilisation of the system was
affected by means of massive waste production; capitalism East and
West poured much of its surpluses into arms production. One effect of
this new stage in the development of capitalism was to build into
industry a process of continual technological innovation. Combined
with the need to raise the productivity of labour though
technological advances so as to make each national capital more
competitive on the international market, this created a huge new
demand for skilled intellectual workers.</P>
<P>Other factors also contributed to the post was expansion of higher
education. The nature of post-war capitalism has placed a premium on
a skilled and quiescent labour force; neither repression nor mass
unemployment provided palatable solutions to working class
discontent. Hence the importance of forms of ideological manipulation
and control. The result has been a massive increase in the number of
what the Wobblies called head fixers &ndash; teachers, sociologists,
social workers etc.</P>
<P>The post-war expansion of higher education took place throughout
Western capitalism. In Britain, the decisive point was the Robbins
report which appeared in October 1963 and called for a vast expansion
of higher education. In 1962, 7 per cent of the 19 year old age group
were in full time education; by 1980 &ndash; the proportion would be
increased to 15 per cent &ndash; that is 558,000 students. The
reasoning behind this proposal was stated explicitly:&ndash;</p>

<P class="quoteb">&lsquo;The growing realisation of this country&rsquo;s
economic dependence upon the education of its population has led to
much questioning of the adequacy of the present arrangements. Unless
higher education is rapidly reformed, it is argued, there is little
hope of this densely populated island maintaining an adequate
position in the fiercely competitive world of the future.&rsquo; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<P class="fst">And as Robbins put it else where:&ndash;</p>

<P class="quoteb">&lsquo;I am sure that if we do not move forward on
something like the scale indicated by the recommendation of our
Committee, we are in real danger of being outclassed and undersold.&rsquo;
<a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<P class="fst">The expansion that followed reflected the needs of British
capitalism. Higher education is divided into two sectors; the
so-called autonomous sector, the universities &ndash; and the public
sector which includes colleges of education, polytechnics, arts
colleges and technical and further education colleges. The
universities are funded by the government via the Universities Grants
Committee, whilst all other colleges are funded by the Local
Education authorities. Both receive considerable sums of money from
industry in return for which research is directed by the investing
companies and the controlling committees of the colleges are
dominated by representatives of big business.</P>
<P>Although the universities have been extended and new ones founded,
the fastest rate of expansion has been in the public sector. This
pattern was codified in the Heath government&rsquo;s 1972 White
Paper, Education: a Framework for the Expansion. The expansion of
student numbers to a target of 750,000 for 1980 planned for most of
the expansion in the public sector. The reasons for this are simple;
the public sector is far more directly under the control of the State
and local industry. Students in this sector do not receive automatic
grants but are at the disposal of the local education authority. The
colleges are much more closely related to the needs of industry in
two ways. Firstly, in that large numbers of the students are day or
block release students from a local factory (which will have a large
say in the running of the college) and secondly in that the courses
are much more vocationally related. Expansion in this sector is thus
cheaper and more convenient to the needs of industry. Unlike
universities with libraries, students unions, shops and sometimes
parks and lakes, the technical and further education colleges are
simply a few classrooms slung together.</P>
<P>Students&rsquo; position in society has markedly changed as a re
suit of the expansion of higher education since the war. In part this
is a change in numbers. Students are now a large social group. In
1900 students were 1 per cent of their age group; in 1971-72 there
were 463,000 full time and sandwich students &ndash; 15 per cent of
their age group. In other countries, the proportion is even higher.
In the US they are about 35 per cent of their age group.</P>
<P>More importantly, the place assigned to students by the social
relations of late capitalism has changed. Higher education is no
longer a preparation for, or an entry ticket into, the ruling class.
Most students will become some form of worker. If a student takes his
or her degree in science or engineering he or she can expect to
become a highly skilled worker employed in industry and playing an
integral part in the capitalist productive process. The wages such
workers receive are large but then so are the amounts of surplus
value they produce thanks to their skills. A student taking an arts
subject is more likely to become a white collar worker of some sort,
employed in the middle echelons of the state machinery or industry.
Workers of this type, for example local government employees and
schoolteachers, often receive lower wages than those received by
manual workers and have provided a major source of militant
opposition to incomes policy in Britain in recent years.</P>
<P>At the same time, students as such do not enjoy any definite
relation to the productive process. While they are students, their
future career remains uncertain. Their fate will be settled by
imponderables like the state of the labour market when they leave
college and their performances in examinations. Their time at college
is financed by the State. They have not sold their labour power and
receive no wages, therefore they are not members of the working
class; nor is their situation that of small producers, such as the
old petty-bourgeoisie. Among them there are those, a small minority
who have come from or are heading into the ruling class. Students are
defined socially by their transitional situation. Their future
remains uncertain while they are at college. It will be settled in
the first instance by how they do at their exams. The effect of the
examination system is not to unite students into a socially cohesive
group, but to atomise them; each student&rsquo;s fate is settled by
his or her individual performance separated from that of all the
others.</P>
<P>But they are also an oppressed group. Aspirations as to what
college life might be like are soon dashed by the reality. Insecurity
about their future is reinforced by the isolation of life on a
campus. Although the discipline is less rigid than at school,
decisions about content of course, appointments, price levels or
anything else remain just as remote. The corridors of power inside
colleges are certainly not for the use of students, except on a few
occasions and only then at the convenience of the authorities. This
general alienation of students creates their readiness to rebel.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Contradictions</h4>

<P class="fst">THE HIGHER education system of late capitalism is one geared to a
continual expansion of the system. It therefore rests on the tension
between the attempt to plan an orderly expansion of higher education
and the anarchic and unplanned nature of capitalism.</P>
<P>Decisions about student numbers ten years ago may mean that the
labour market today is clogged up with unwanted graduates. Building
programmes planned years in advance may come into conflict with
decisions to cut public spending. The course taught in the colleges
may bear little relation to the immediate needs of industry. An over
hasty expansion of higher education may mean crowded libraries,
scarce accommodation, poor facilities for the students thrust into
the colleges by a capitalist state feeling the bite of foreign
competition. All these are forms of the basic contradiction faced by
national capitals as they try to plan the expansion of higher
education, while responding to the pressure of competition, boom and
slump, which render it impossible to plan.</P>
<P>Spending on higher education means that a portion of the surplus
value created in industry is diverted from the accumulation of
capital and instead spent on what is seen as a necessary expense of
production. But in a period like the present, as capitalism veers
into ever deeper crisis and international competition takes on an
increasingly acute form, every capitalist state is under tremendous
pressure to reduce spending on higher education, thus freeing more
resources for productive investment.</P>
<P>This is particularly so in the case of a relatively weak
capitalist nation like Britain. If Britain is to keep a place on the
world market, then it must continue to expand higher education. But,
given British capital&rsquo;s crisis of profitability, the cost of
the expansion must be lowered. The 1972 White Paper places cutting
costs at the centre of its strategy:&ndash;</p>

<P class="quoteb">&lsquo;If expansion is to be continued as indicated in
the decade ahead, unit costs cannot be allowed to go on rising and
scope must be found fpr economies of scale.&rsquo; <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<P class="fst">In other words, numbers are still to be expanded while costs are
cut.</P>
<P>So, staff-student ratios are to be raised. Students are to be
encouraged to live at home and go to colleges in their area; a
two-year strictly vocational diploma in Higher Education has been
introduced which does not qualify its holder for further studies.
Large numbers of small colleges are to be amalgamated or closed; no:
new universities are to be set up.</P>
<P>In December 1973 the combination of the oil crisis and the miners&rsquo;
go slow forced an extension of this government policy of higher
education on the cheap. Anthony Barber&rsquo;s emergency budget
sliced &pound;180 million off education spending. This meant cuts
right across the board from nursery schools to the universities. New
building has been frozen completely in the university and polytechnic
sectors, partially in the schools and CPEs. The policy of closures
among colleges of education has been speeded-up. The results are
increased overcrowding, higher student/staff ratios, unfilled
vacancies, redundancies among college workers, rent and price
increases. The target for student numbers in 1980-81 has been cut
from 750,000 to 650,000. The university sector is in deficit,
individual universities are suffering very severe cash crises. The
vice chancellor of Lancaster university has already predicted that
one university may go bust within a year or so. These cutbacks,
although introduced by the Tories, has been continued by the Labour
government.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The Student Revolt Round One: The Late Sixties</h4>

<P class="fst">IN THE great student revolts of the late sixties, the dominant
role was played by politics. Across the world the hopes aroused by
the revival in a number of countries of the parliamentary left, or
even centre, had been shattered. The Students for a Democratic
Society in the US abandoned their slogan in the 1964 election, &lsquo;Half
the Way with LBJ&rsquo;, for militant opposition to Johnson&rsquo;s
Great Society as it dissolved into imperialist war in Vietnam and
black rebellions in the cities. The French Communist Party took a
back seat over Algeria and Vietnam rather than complicate its
strategy of alliance with the social democratic left. In West
Germany, the Social Democratic Party formed a Grand Coalition with
the right and rammed repressive emergency laws through the Bundestag.
And Harold Wilson broke the seaman&rsquo;s strike, froze wages and
backed the Americans in Vietnam.</P>
<P>Opposition to the Vietnam war was the thread running through all
the student rebellions. The high hopes raised by the revival of the
left had been dashed; what was revealed was imperialist barbarism
laying a small country waste. The international campaign against the
Vietnam war was spearheaded by students; it both served to fuel the
student revolt and was mightily strengthened by it. The Comite
Vietnam National in France was the training ground for the student
leaders of the May 1968 revolt; the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign in
this country was based on the student militants.</P>
<P>But students were also experiencing the effects of the
contradictions between the expansion of higher education and the
anarchic nature of the system. At <I>both</I> LSE and Sorbonne they
suffered from over-crowding and poor facilities and were hedged in
with dozens of pettifogging restrictions. In British universities the
authorities claimed to be <I>in loco parentis</I> &ndash; to have the
powers of a parent over the students. At Nanterre, the segregation of
the men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s residential blocs helped to spark
off the 1968 revolt. At Berkeley in 1964 even the Republicans for
Goldwater backed the Free Speech Movement&rsquo;s campaign against
the administrations ban on political activities on campus.</P>
<P>In Britain the first wave of revolts began and ended at LSE. It
was the appointment of a new Director, Walter Adams who had a dubious
record as Principal of the University College of Rhodesia, that set the train of events off. But the first
occupation which took place in March 1967 as a protest against the
suspension of the President of the Students Union for objecting to
Adam&rsquo;s appointment in a letter to the Times, was not entirely
spontaneous. A small but active Socialist Society had agitated for a
number of years around issues like Rhodesia and incomes policy,
winning a committed group of supporters. It was the Socialist Society
that took up the Adams issue and drummed up opposition to the
appointment. And, although the occupation was voted on the proposal
of the Tory President-Elect of the union, it was the Socialist
Society that forced the pace in the sit-in.</P>
<P>The first LSE occupation, although successful, found no echoes. In
the absence of concerted working class resistance to Wilson&rsquo;s
incomes policy, with no students elsewhere taking up their example,
the revolutionary students thrown up by the events at the LSE found
themselves isolated. They involved themselves outside the LSE, in the
GLC Tenants Action Committee and the Barbican dispute.</P>
<P>The effect of external political events, above all the May
uprising in France and the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign in Britain,
sparked off a wave of student militancy throughout the country. The
occupations for example, at Hull University and Hornsey College of
Art, were seen not simply as a challenge to the college authorities,
but as one to the system itself. In June 1968 the Revolutionary
Socialists Student Federation was founded to link up the various
struggles through an organisation uniting the militants.</P>
<P>The autumn of 1968 saw the high point of the revolt. On October
the 27th one of the greatest demonstrations in London since the
Chartists had 100,000 marching on the US embassy in Grosvenor Square
behind the slogan &lsquo;Victory to the NLF&rsquo;. There existed
genuine and widespread belief that students in Britain could repeat
the French example and detonate workers&rsquo; uprising against the
system. Those who had led the struggle at the LSE and elsewhere,
primarily the International Socialists, found themselves outflanked
by those who held this belief and who sought to drive students into
action in the hope of sparking off the revolution they expected by
the hour.</P>
<P>This period highlighted two of the main political dangers featured
in student struggles &ndash; opportunism, and abstentionism. The
latter consists in the dismissal of student struggles as peripheral
to the class struggle and hence the refusal to participate in them.
The most obvious example here is that of the Socialist Labour League
(now Workers&rsquo; Revolutionary Party) who only turned up at the
great Vietnam demonstrations to distribute leaflets entitled &lsquo;Why
we are not marching&rsquo;. This is an example of where an apparently
very &lsquo;left&rsquo; position &ndash; workers&rsquo; struggles are
all that matter, student militants should relate to them,
demonstrations against the Vietnam war are mere &lsquo;protest
politics&rsquo; since they cannot overthrow the capitalist state &ndash;
in fact results in a conservative abstention from a mass movement,
thus avoiding all the very real risks &ndash; victimisation, jail,
skulls broken by the police &ndash; which protest politics involve.</P>
<P>The mirror image to this position is that adopted by Ernest
Mandel, leader of the &lsquo;Fourth International&rsquo;, and his
associates. The degeneration of the &lsquo;Fourth International&rsquo;
had left them without any comprehensive analysis of the latest stage
of capitalism and of the central position of the working class as the
only force capable of destroying imperialism. Hence the obsessive
quest for some force that could replace the apparently quiescent
working class as the agency of revolution and the opportunist ability
to adapt their analysis to fit whatever new element that was thrown
into the struggle against capitalism. In this search, the student
revolt came as a godsend. Mandel declared that &lsquo;<I>the
university can be a cradle of a real revolution&rsquo;.</I> <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> Students
joined youth, Third World guerillas and blacks as one of the
proclaimed &lsquo;new vanguards&rsquo; of the international
revolution in the &lsquo;Fourth International&rsquo;s endless
attempts to make friends and influence people.</P>
<P>This ultra-left canonisation of the student movement gave rise in
Britain to the theory of red bases. It was argued in the pages of <B>New
Left Review</B> that the colleges could become organs of dual
power-&rsquo;red bases&rsquo;-that would challenge capitalism&rsquo;s
legitimacy as well as its monopoly of violence. The argument rested
on doutbful analogies with Cuba and China;</p>

<P class="quoteb">&lsquo;The guerilla&rsquo;s liberated zone is initially
located in those areas which are <I>geographically</I> inaccessible
to the repressive forces of the established order. We must ask
ourselves whether the complex structures of late capitalism do not
contain areas sociologically inaccessible to the repressive forces of
the ruling class.&rsquo; <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<P class="fst">The answer is that they don&rsquo;t. How sociologically
inaccessible to Papadopoulos&rsquo; tanks did Athens Polytechnic
prove to be? Nonetheless, a resolution calling for the establishment
of red bases was passed at the second RSSF conference in November
1968.</P>
<P>The conflict the emergence of student vanguardism gave rise to was
acted out at LSE. The School was occupied during the weekend of the
October 27 demo to provide accommodation and first-aid facilities.
The authorities&rsquo; attempt to prevent the occupation only raised
support for the left to an all-time high. But its aftermath was
confusion on the left and a decision by the School to clamp down. The
ultra-left, a motley assortment of American New Leftists, Maoists and
luminaries of <B>New Left Review</B>, pressed for further action to
pre-empt the authorities&rsquo; plan to instal new gates in the
School buildings. Robin Blackburn announced in a leaflet to the
Socialist Society that &lsquo;those who reject the strategy of the
Red Bases and the tactic of the New Year Offensive will be in serious
danger of becoming the objective allies of social imperialism and
social fascism&rsquo;. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> The International Socialists, who had won
the leadership of the left through their role in the first sit-in and
in the VSC, argued that the mass of students were not prepared for
the sort of confrontation that the ultra left were proposing and the
authorities hoping for.</P>
<P>In the event they were proved right. A confused chain of events
led to the removal of the gates. However, when IS proposed a sit-in
to stave off the inevitable closure of the School they won little
support even from the left. The left was simply too weak to mount the
defensive struggle their action entailed. The occupation and strike
that followed the reopening of the School did not prevent the sacking
of Blackburn and another left-wing lecturer, nor the arrest or
suspension of a number of students. RSSF, although it succeeded in
mobilising several thousand students for a demonstration at LSE and
in mounting a number of sympathy occupations, could not crack the
united front presented by the Committee of Vice Chancellors and
Principals, who clearly saw the clampdown at LSE as an example to
their own students. It eventually dissolved into a sectarian talking
shop, and then vanished.</P>
<P>But the first phase of student revolt in Britain was not quite
over. The discovery of political files kept by the authorities on
students during an occupation at Warwick University in February 1970
led to the most massive wave of sit-ins Britain had yet seen.
Traditionally conservative &lsquo; universities like Manchester and
Oxford saw thousands of students occupying. Here again, the sit-ins
did not come quite out of the blue. At Oxford the local branch of
RSSF had since 1969 been campaigning against the reactionary
university and college authorities; Manchester had seen protests
against the undemocratic way the new Vice Chancellor had been
appointed. The issue of files served to focus a whole number of
grievances about the repressive and authoritarian structure of higher
education, and the increasing interpenetration of academic and
industrial interests.</P>
<P>The response of the authorities was generally to refuse
concessions and fight it out. In this they were largely successful.
They were aided by the mistakes of the left and the ability of both
national and local student union bureaucrats to defuse militancy and
divert the focus of students&rsquo; attention away from mounting and
extending direct action. At Manchester negotiators conceded away most
of the students&rsquo; demands. At Oxford the Student Representative
Council succeeded in leading the occupation out into a campaign
against a new disciplinary statute and for a &lsquo;Democratic
University&rsquo;. By the end of the year the files issue was dead.</P>
<P>Thus ended the first wave of student militancy. If it had arisen
out of a unique combination of general political factors and limited
student grievances it did have certain general lessons to teach.</P>
<P>One lesson is that student struggles are extremely volatile.
Because of the fragmentation and isolation that is their existence,
students can move very quickly between passivity and militancy. When
they do rebel they do so with tremendous force, inventiveness and
spirit, rapidly generalising and taking the struggle beyond
grievances specific to their situation to a rebellion against the
capitalist system. At the same time, once the particular struggle
they are involved in is on the downturn, they can relapse very
quickly into complete apathy.</P>
<P>A second lesson that emerged was the limitations inherent in
student struggles. The students in the Latin Quarter, thanks to a
very special configuration of events, were able to spark off a
massive general strike. But they were unable to overcome the
conservative dead-weight of the French Communist Party, which
prevented the strike from developing in the direction of a workers&rsquo;
revolution. In Britain the students at LSE were unable to match the
combined forces of the authorities and the State, and the heady
currents of October 27 soon dissipated.</P>
<P>Yet the student revolt did give the revolutionary left a
tremendous fillip. Indeed, in many countries it was the making of the
revolutionary left. After the long night of the Cold War,
revolutionaries found an audience for their politics and recruits to
their ranks. In many countries, for example, West Germany, the
revolutionary left remained a primarily student phenomenon. In
Britain the student movement provided a levy of revolutionary
socialists who saw the limits inherent in the struggles they had led
and recognised that the working class alone was the agency of
revolution. They accordingly set themselves the task of building a
mass party based on the working class. The growth of the
International Socialists and their transformation into a working
class organisation over the last few years depended in part on the
base it had won leading struggles like that at LSE.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The Student Revolt Round Two: 1970/73</h4>

<P class="fst">THE CHARACTER of the student movement today is markedly different
from its forerunner in the late sixties. The period between the two
upsurges contains the key to understanding the changes.</P>
<P>The 1970s saw the re-birth of an aggressive workers movement.
Inflation was accelerating and the Tories made a determined effort to
hold back wages through the Industrial Relations Act and various
attempts to establish wage norms. Starting with the dustmens strike
of Christmas 1969 more and more workers struck for more pay. The
culmination came in 1972 when the Miners smashed the Tory pay policy
and the dockers, in securing the release of the Pentonville Five,
crippled the Industrial Relations Act.</P>
<P>This meant that theories of student vanguardism went out of the
window. The focus was no longer the Vietnam war but solidarity with
workers struggles. At the same time in the colleges the effects of
inflation were beginning to bite. The value of the student grant
declined rapidly and for those who only received discretionary awards
the issue of grants became crucial.</P>
<P>This lead to two important changes. Firstly the National Union of
Students was pushed to the centre of the stage, and secondly the
majority of students became concerned to defend their material
interests.</P>
<P>In the sixties revolutionaries had rightly ignored the NUS. Its
bureaucratic structure controlled by right wing social democrats and
linked with the CIA, ruled it out as an instrument of student for
student demands. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> But the NUS itself was not unaffected by the
shift to the left in the colleges. A forerunner of the present Broad
Left, an alliance of the Communist Party and Labour Party left
wingers, was able to capture control of the NUS Executive. By 1971
NUS had elected a CP President, Digby Jacks. This was all very fine
but apart from the setting up of an International Department, which
followed Russian foreign policy, the Union was still unimportant to
the mass of students. What changed the situation was the attempts by
the Tory government in 1972 to stop students&rsquo; unions from
making payments to strike funds or to the &lsquo;free school milk&rsquo;
campaign. A series of court cases had merely accelerated the flow of
money. Margaret Thatcher introduced proposals to take students unions
under the wing of an Auditor General, who would authorise all
payments.</P>
<P>This threatened the very existence of independent student unions,
which had become regarded by students as their right. The fight
against the Thatcher proposals sparked the imaginations of virtually
every student, from the Socialist Society fighting for survival to
the Rugby Club concerned that the number of away matches might be
cut. For the first time there was a need to take the issues up on a
national level, to co-ordinate the fight back. NUS became central in
the minds of students. For the first time the NUS conference became a
debate between the Broad Left and the revolutionary left, since the
right wing had completely lost its base through not fighting for the
autonomy of students unions. To begin with, the debate centred around
the response to the Tory proposals, but it soon spread to a number of
related issues &ndash; for example, the nature of students and their
relation to the working class &ndash; as well as issues like Ireland.
In the absence of local struggles, the influence of revolutionaries,
principally IS, was out of all proportions to their real base in the
colleges. Once the autonomy of student unions had been successfully
defended, the issue of student grants became the focus nationally. In
1972/73 and 1973/74 the first national grants campaigns were
organised. These were supported by rent strikes in some colleges and
by huge demonstrations. The character of these demonstrations was
markedly different from that of the VSC demos. They involved far less
political commitment. Defiance was expressed not by fighting the
police but by wearing outlandish clothes and carrying colourful
placards and banners. The students were different too. The majority
came not from the universities but from the small colleges with a
much higher proportion of working class students.</P>
<P>But, while this period saw the emergence of a really national
student movement, the locally-based militancy of the VSC days was
missing. However, the sporadic local struggles that did take place
were by and large led by IS members. It was not only the NUS that had
changed but also the local student unions, which had become genuine
forums of debate in the colleges regularly involving large numbers of
students. It was here that revolutionaries argued from week to week
about support for strikers and the need to see the grants campaign in
the context of a British capitalism in increasing crisis. It was the
revolutionaries, again principally IS, that led the support for the
two miners&rsquo; strikes and many local disputes. The result was
that, as a nationwide upsurge of student militancy is now gathering
strength, the Broad Left controls the student union bureaucracies,
but IS has established a political base in the colleges from which to
intervene.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The Student Movement Phase Three: The Present</h4>

<P class="fst">THE LAST few months have confirmed beyond any shadow of doubt that
the student movement is re-establishing itself. Once again thousands
of students are involved in militant conflict with the authorities.
The central issue this time is the cutback in education spending. The
&pound;250 million cut from the education budget coupled with the
re-direction towards vocationally orientated courses, are causing
cutbacks, closures, price rises and redundancies in every college in
the country.</P>
<P>Inevitably this has led to a re-emergence of locally based
struggles. However the existence of a national student movement
ensures that these local fights against the cuts have a national
perspective. Many of the militants involved expect support from their
national union. Needless to say their expectations are not fulfilled
by a union whose Executive is dominated by careerists and social
democrats.</P>
<P>Increasingly the polarisation between the leadership, and the rank
and file students actually resisting the cuts, is forced into the
open. Moreover, to fight the cuts in the present circumstances
requires an overtly political fight. Students are having to reply to
the attacks with a very clear understanding of what they are fighting
and how they can win. The rejection of alliances with so called
progressive vice-chancellors or principals and a working alliance
with the trade unions in the college (NUPE, ASTMS, ATTI) is becoming
essential for victory. It might have been possible a few years ago to
simply apply mild pressure onto the college to force concessions,
today students are being forced to the most militant tactics to gain
any ground at all.</P>
<P>These two factors, the expectations from the national union and
the determination of the government to cut back education, present
revolutionaries with the tremendous opportunities to intervene
successfully.</P>
<P>Firstly in the colleges, it is increasingly only revolutionaries
and often IS members who can provide the leadership. Faced with the
closure of the college or a thirty per cent rent rise, those who can
only offer empty rhetoric about democratising education and the need
to unite the mass of students do not capture the attention of the
militants in the colleges who are interested in fighting. Meetings
involving hundreds or even thousands of students from one college are
listening to the arguments put forward about the nature of the
crisis, the Labour government, who runs the colleges, and the need to
take direct action. Many of these meetings are voting for militant
action. This time it is not the universities that are the backbone
but the polytechnics, the further education colleges and the colleges
of education. These are the colleges that are feeling the pinch the
hardest. The need for the disputes to be linked nationally is clear
to those involved. The failure of NUS to do this is also clear. The
possibilities of developing a national student movement with direct
links to a revolutionary workers&rsquo; organisation are immense.
That is why the National Organisation of IS Societies was founded
last year. Already it has established itself as a force in the
student movement. Many of the militants in the colleges are involving
themselves in IS Societies, or at least are prepared to work with
them. At a national level the NOISS was patently the only
organisation that attempted to link up the struggles and provide
national support for any college in dispute.</P>
<P>In the days of VSC, union meetings would be dominated by Tories
and their supporters. The left could make the running on the
demonstrations but the right controlled the machinery. The
development in the early 1970s of student unions as fighting unions
rather than social clubs, coupled with the unpopularity of the Tory
government, pushed the right wing out of most unions and their
influence nearly everywhere became minimal. This remains the case
today. The Tories have nothing to say about fighting the cuts and
therefore cannot gain a hearing. However on the political front it
would be dangerous to ignore their potential. When NUS conference
voted for &lsquo;no free speech for fascists&rsquo;, the right were
provided with the support they had lacked for several years. They
were not able to hold the support or commit large numbers of students
but the potential was there. Of course the left was also provided
with large audiences to put the arguments to and was able to build
support from meetings. More recently the bombings in Birmingham have
provided the right with a similar opportunity. Whilst the
revolutionaries remain active within the student movement and the
working class do not suffer major defeats then the right are unlikely
to gain much support. It is therefore vital that while these
opportunities are open to us, they are utilised to the full.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Revolutionaries and the Student Movement</h4>

<P class="fst">THE CHANGED position of students under late capitalism, the deep
crisis the system is undergoing, the attacks on higher education, all
these factors have combined to create a situation in which the
opportunities for winning large numbers of students to revolutionary
politics are tremendous.</P>
<P>But these opportunities will have to be taken. Students will not
<I>automatically</I> gravitate to the side of the working class.
Workers experience on the shopfloor a continual unifying pressure
that arises out of the day-to-day struggle over how much surplus
value is squeezed out of them by the bosses. Wages, hours, speed up,
conditions, manning, battles over all these issues force workers to
organise and act together in the workplace. But we have seen that
their situation isolates and fragments students.</P>
<P>Whether students overcome the atomising pressures inherent in
their position and unite to challenge capitalism depends upon the
overall political situation. In certain circumstances &ndash; those
of social crisis and a demoralised workers&rsquo; movement &ndash;
students can be won to fascism. Fatherland and Freedom, the Chilean
fascists, had a significant base among students. The National Front
has set up a Students Association in an attempt to build a base in
the colleges. This has failed as yet; but a neglect of the student
movement by revolutionaries could change things.</P>
<P>Students must see socialism as a real alternative to a system in
crisis. In the long run, this will depend on there being a mass
revolutionary party based in the workers&rsquo; movement that can
offer students this alternative. In the short term, revolutionaries
committed to building such a party must intervene among students to
win large numbers of them to socialist politics.</P>
<P>In Britain there are two main left groups that operate in the
student movement &ndash; the Communist Party and the International
Socialists.</P>
<P>The Communist Party&rsquo;s perspective centres around the Broad
Left, its alliance with Labour Party reformists. The Broad Left is
seen as the driving force for the mass movement among students that
NUS increasingly expresses. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> It is able to serve this role because
it draws together the left in the colleges on a basis that does not
commit the various allies to a definite political programme but which
seeks to strengthen the mass movement through fighting around
students&rsquo; grievances. In all this it differs from &lsquo;the
sectarian approach of the ultra left&rsquo; (IS etc.),</p>

<P class="quoteb">&lsquo;... an approach to work in mass organisations
which is contemptuous of their &ldquo;limited&rdquo; objectives, and
seeks only to use them to benefit the &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo;
objectives of another organisation.&rsquo; <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<P class="fst">Or so the story goes. The reality is somewhat different. While
obviously revolutionaries must often unite with reformists around
particular issues, the dangers of a permanent political alliance with
reformists on no firmer basis than a commitment to work in mass
student organisations are obvious. They are fully realised in the
case of the Broad Left. Work in the mass movement, as in the case of
the Communist Party in the trade unions, is identified with the hunt
after union positions. The absence of any definite programme defining
the Broad Left&rsquo;s politics serves as a perfect cover for the
worst sort of opportunism. Broad Left candidates for posts in both
the NUS and local student unions change the cut of their coats as the
political climate changes. The result is that when an issue of
political principle that both has important practical bearings and
splits the student movement, the Broad Left is unable to take up a
coherent position. For example, when the NUS conference in April 1974
passed a resolution denying fascists a platform in the colleges, the
Broad Left at first adopted heroic anti-fascist postures at the
rostrum, but split in all directions and then retreated in the face
of a major right-wing backlash.</P>
<P>More importantly, capitalist crisis changes the struggle for
reforms. To demand even the most modest reform from a system
splitting apart at the seams is a serious challenge. To organise a
real fight for reforms in these circumstances increasingly implies a
commitment to the revolutionary overthrow of the system. The strains
of this paradox are increasingly felt by a reformist grouping like
the Broad Left. The result is, on a national level, a rhetorical
commitment to a mass campaign of direct action on issues like the
cuts and grants, combined with a complete failure to translate this
commitment into action. At a local level it frequently means
alliances with the right wing to prevent direct action from taking
place (Leeds and Stirling universities saw examples of this in 1974).
What is needed is an organisation that combines a commitment to
building a revolutionary party based on the working class with a
strategy of militant action in the student movement. This means
organising around the issues that affect students directly, like the
education cuts, and seeking to initiate and lead struggles based on
these grievances. While these struggles may often break out
spontaneously, increasingly it will only be revolutionaries who can
provide a political direction for them. Moreover, the experience of
the late &lsquo;sixties shows that it is through involvement in mass
action that students in large numbers become open to the appeal of
revolutionary politics. And the only way for revolutionaries to
establish the correctness of their politics with the mass of
students, as with the mass of workers, is not alone by propaganda
from the outside but by giving a lead in their struggles.</P>
<P>These factors led to the emergence of the National Organisation of
International Socialist Societies. The aim of NOISS is to provide the
focus for the left in the colleges through its intervention in
student struggles. The scale of the British crisis means that it is
not enough to win student militants to revolutionary socialism as
such; what is now needed is an organisation of revolutionary students
who identify politically with IS&rsquo;s strategy for building a
socialist workers&rsquo; party. But NOISS will be built through its
intervention among students. Already there are about 90 IS Societies.
The founding conference of NOISS at Leeds in November 1974 was
attended by delegates from 28 universities, 11 polytechnics, 6
colleges of education, and 6 colleges of further education and
technical colleges. Its journal, <B>Agitator</B>, has a circulation
of about 3,000.</P>
<P>At a national level, NOISS has already emerged as the left
opposition to the CP-dominated NUS Executive. An emergency NUS
conference in June 1974 adopted a strategy for fighting on grants and
the cuts proposed by the IS Societies. Although an extension of this
strategy was rejected by NUS conference at Margate in November 1974,
the IS Societies played a prominent part in the local struggles that
burst out that term, and in the NUS grants week of action.</P>
<P>The task for NOISS now is to develop the base it already has. The
crisis in higher education has drawn into struggle large numbers of
students with little previous contact with left politics. The test
for NOISS will be its members&rsquo; ability to break with the narrow
tradition of sectarian politics in which the revolutionary left has
found itself in the colleges of recent years and to relate to the
mass of students. This means developing a tradition of mass work,
being able to combine a principled and consistent revolutionary
perspective with agitation around student grievances that draws in
the largest number of students but to <I>fight</I> for their demands.
It also means reviving the anti-imperialist traditions of the student
movement which in recent years have become the captive of the
Communist Party and its version of the Moscow line. The opportunities
are there. It is up to NOISS to take up the challenge.</P>
