<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Three times since 1979, the political game has seemed
to be up for the Tories in midterm. Three times, they came back to
win. Doing the same thing again should be easy, you may think, thanks
to the economic recovery that is now under way. It is starting to
look anything but.&#8217; <strong>The Economist</strong> 15 January 1994.</p>

<p class="fst">Anyone considering the state of the Tory government even a month
ago would have been hard pressed to reach such a conclusion, but
hardly had the new year dawned when John Major&#8217;s government was
plunged into a daily round of crises, each more seemingly damaging
than the last.</p>

<p>Many of these scandals can only be described as trivial. But taken
together they represent such a serious blow to Major that his demise
is openly discussed, with &#8216;when&#8217; rather than &#8216;if&#8217; becoming
the key speculation. How can a government with three years of its
parliamentary term to run end up in such chaos?</p>

<p>The issues concerned are much greater than a series of sex
scandals. Outrage at the scandals has resulted from the obvious
hypocrisy of Tory ministers and MPs: they are doing things which they
denounce the rest of us for doing. Cheap attacks on single mothers
which won them support at the Tory Party conference last year have
now rebounded on them.</p>

<p>However, most of the problems facing the government do not result
from personal scandals but as a direct result of Tory policies. This
is a government which trumpeted the arrival of a &#8216;home-owning
democracy&#8217; and whose flagship council, Westminster, stands accused
of gerrymandering: selling houses to potential Tory voters in order
to maintain control of the council. The homeless and those on the
waiting list were, at best, rehoused many miles away from their
families and friends.</p>

<p>This is a government which is penalising the vast majority of the
population &#8211; another 400,000 of the poorest in work will pay tax
from this April as a result of the budget &#8211; while it rewards its
own friends and supporters. So individual MPs have made fortunes from
buying then reselling council houses from Westminster Council. Tory
Central Office itself stands accused of buying its own headquarters
from the council and reselling at a &#163;2 million profit.</p>

<p>Nowhere does its policy of rewarding big business stand out more
than in its sleazy arms deals. The cover up of arms sales to Iraq is
well known. Recent revelations of record aid awarded to Malaysia for
an unwanted dam in order to secure an arms deal with its government
show how widely the arms sales are promoted by government.</p>

<p>There is a horrible stench of graft and corruption everywhere.
After 14 years Tory rule increasingly looks like that of a remote
oligarchy, in office to benefit itself and its immediate associates
regardless of the consequences to anyone else.</p>

<p>Many MPs and councillors find it impossible to conceive of ever
being in opposition, and accept the bounty of office as natural and
justifiable. The huge increase in the number of quangos under the
Tories (there are 40,000 government appointees on quangos) has given
these people and their families lucrative pickings. Health, education
and most other areas of public life are now run by those who owe
their allegiance to the Tory government and who measure everything by
profit and loss accounts.</p>

<p>Previous Tory governments have been corrupt, but it is impossible
to conceive of the current level of corruption without the series of
Tory policies which actively encouraged it: privatisation, with the
discounted sale of shares, subsidies for council house sales,
competitive tendering, where local businessmen could win lucrative
contracts while cutting workers&#8217; wages, the creation of whole new
management layers in every area of public life from the prisons to
the the hospitals. And of course arms dealing.</p>

<p>The Thatcher boom of the mid 1980s was at its strongest in the
defence industries, much of whose production was destined for export
to dictators around the world. These arms deals go right to the heart
of government and the Tory Party.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that the scandals have much wider
political implications than the Tories might expect. They are so
severe that they have even set the Tories at each others&#8217; throats.
A recent commentary by Philip Stephen in the <strong>Financial Times</strong>
(17 January) put it like this:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;As [Major&#8217;s] authority wanes, he is finding it
harder and harder to reestablish discipline within the government and
the party. Concerted campaigns to bolster that authority can only be
launched so often. The mood among Tory constituency activists is
ugly. Attempts to disentangle the party conference clarion call for a
return to traditional values from the personal behaviour of
politicians have not gone down well. Many activists view the
government as incompetent, the prime minister as not up to the job.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">The discontent among Tory ranks comes overwhelmingly from the
unpopularity of government policies, which activists on the ground
feel much more strongly than remote figures in government. They know
that VAT on fuel is as unpopular as ever, that other tax rises will
hit the majority &#8211; not just workers but large sections of the
middle class &#8211; very hard, and that the scandals are being very
badly received by traditional Tory supporters.</p>

<p>The recent speech by Michael Portillo, chosen leadership candidate
of the Tory right, demonstrated how out of touch the Tories really
are. He attacked a mood of cynicism which was affecting the standing
of the &#8216;great institutions&#8217;: &#8216;If crown, parliament and church
are not respected, neither will be law, judges or policemen, nor
bosses, managers or foremen.&#8217;</p>

<p>Portillo blames this on an &#8216;elite&#8217; spreading such
disaffection, by which he means the once faithful Tory press and
other commentators. But it is obvious to virtually everyone outside
Portillo&#8217;s own political circle that cynicism about the dominant
institutions in British society has been brought on by the actions of
those who run these institutions.</p>

<p>It is hardly surprising that a recent poll showed that &#8216;six
voters think that the government is doing a bad job for every one who
thinks it is doing well,&#8217; when, for example, it is common knowledge
that the Tory &#8216;flagship councils&#8217; were given extra government
grants in order to ensure that their poll tax levels were negligible
and so hand them electoral victory in 1990.</p>

<p>Nor is it surprising that a December opinion poll showed that
three quarters questioned wanted to give <em>no</em> public money to
the royal family, believing that they should fund themselves, when
the conspicuous consumption of the royals stands in such contrast to
the cuts in hospitals and schools used by ordinary people.</p>

<p>The connection between Tory policies and the various scandals
means that many more are likely to hit the news. Already there is
talk of investigations into other Tory councils such as Brent and
Wandsworth, and there are certainly many shady deals involving Tory
MPs which have not yet come to light. Such revelations are likely to
rock the government even harder.</p>

<p>This leaves out the whole question of policy. Already, the Tories
try to put as little through parliament as they can get away with.
Parliamentary recesses have been at record levels over the past year.
The Police and Magistrates&#8217; Courts Bill was mauled by Tory
supporters in the House of Lords. They are not confident about
getting most pieces of legislation passed.</p>

<p>Above all, looming over government decisions is what happens with
the budget. This was hailed as a great success for Kenneth Clarke by
the &#8216;chattering classes&#8217; Michael Portillo now attacks. Most
commentators agreed that it was a good budget for the Tories. Yet it
made no dent in Tory unpopularity at the polls and has clearly not
been well received by the mass of working people.</p>

<p>There is every sign that it will fuel political anger and unrest
outside parliament, as we are beginning to see with students and
among some groups of workers who will suffer under the three year pay
freeze imposed by Clarke&#8217;s budget.</p>

<p>This makes it near impossible for Major to restore his
government&#8217;s fortunes. Even the opinion polls indicate that the
depths of unpopularity now facing the Tories are greater than they
have been at any time during the 1980s. Even compared with January
1981, when Thatcher&#8217;s unpopularity was at a low, Labour had only
around half the lead it now has over the Tories, and twice as many
people were satisfied with the government (see table).</p>

<p class="fst">Opinion polls in the past month give a massive lead to Labour of
up to 24 percent ahead of the Tories. And <strong>The Economist</strong>
pointed out recently that links between economic recovery and the
Tory leader&#8217;s popularity have been broken in the last year.</p>

<p>All this suggests that this crisis is too deep for Major &#8211; or
indeed any other Tory leader &#8211; to easily escape from. But there is
a much more fundamental reason why &#8211; and it is one which Michael
Portillo touched on when he bemoaned the lack of respect for institutions.</p>

<p>The crisis of government and parliamentary politics is part of a
much wider crisis. The old institutions which did so much to hold
British society together and to encourage deference to the &#8216;higher
orders&#8217; are now in a state of disarray. The Church of England &#8211;
known as the &#8216;Tory party at prayer&#8217; &#8211; finds itself under attack
from sections of government.</p>

<p>The monarchy has the look of a soap opera which has been running
too long. The judges have too often shown themselves blind to any
notion of justice for them to be widely respected.</p>

<p>The attacks on the Tories from their erstwhile friends in the
press are symptomatic of a society whose central, fixed and stable
ideas have crumbled &#8211; with nothing to replace them. Hence the
appeal to some Tories of &#8216;traditional values&#8217;, of harking back to
a seemingly golden age where everyone knew their place, and where a
respected monarchy and church were the pinnacle of an unwritten
constitution administered by Tory judges and (usually) a Tory government.</p>

<p>But most people do not want such a society. Whereas in 1983, for
example, 28 percent of people wanted an extension of welfare
benefits, today 48 percent do. Yet such a society is certainly not on
offer from the Tories.</p>

<p>Nor does Labour have any clear vision of a better society, despite
its formal commitment to more equality. Indeed the crisis of ideas
leads the shadow cabinet to further caution, as its members echo some
of the Tory right on the need for greater family values, a stronger
crackdown on crime and so on.</p>

<p>All this leaves an ideological vacuum. The old ideas no longer
command the allegiance of millions, yet many people do not really
know what to put in their place. So there is growing discontent,
especially focussed on government, but no obvious alternative.</p>
<p>In the absence of much parliamentary opposition we will have to
look elsewhere for an expression of the anger which is so prevalent
at the moment. This requires two things. The first is the building of
activity which can begin to halt the attacks, regardless of what is
said in parliament. The pensioners&#8217; demonstrations last year meant
that the Tories were forced to double the rate of compensation for
VAT on fuel. The strike by nurses at UCH last autumn led to the
hospital&#8217;s reprieve just before Xmas.</p>

<p>The fights to come over taxation, the pay freeze, cuts in welfare,
student grants and against the fascists can all help to build a mood
of confidence. But any recovery in confidence will be uneven and
patchy &#8211; hence the importance of the second element: the building
of revolutionary organisation which can give a sense of direction and
coherence through linking up the struggles and applying their lessons
to different issues.</p>

<p>There is a strong contrast between the hatred and contempt for
&#8216;official&#8217; politics with its corruption at every level, and with
the ineffectiveness of even its most principled proponents, and the
growth of interest in politics at the level of struggle and activity.
The more this element can grow and become more effective, the more we
can ensure that Major&#8217;s political crisis worsens.</p>

<h3>Dammed if you do</h3>

<p class="fst">The Tories used the carrot of overseas aid to sell arms to
Malaysia. Top civil servant Sir Tim Lankester wrote a formal
memorandum saying that money should not be spent on the Pergau hydro
electric dam project in Malaysia. It was estimated to cost &#163;234
million &#8211; the most expensive ever overseas aid project. It would
not be economic until well into the next century, and much more
expensive to Malaysian consumers than any other form of energy
costing them &#163;100 million more than the alternatives.</p>

<p>Lankester was overruled at cabinet level &#8211; an unprecedented
move. Why? Because the government linked the dam project with the
sale of arms to the Malaysian government. It refused to do so on
paper. But Lord Younger &#8211; then defence secretary &#8211; has since said
that &#8216;the Malaysians said there would be no military contract
without the aid project&#8217; and that a &#8216;verbal undertaking was given
by somebody &#8211; not myself &#8211; to link the aid to the defence contract&#8217;.</p>

<p>Could that somebody have been Margaret Thatcher herself? Maybe
that is why John Major has refused to release papers on the deal for
MPs to scrutinise the dam project, described as &#8216;a waste of
taxpayers&#8217; money&#8217; by the National Audit Office.</p>

<a name="porter"></a>
<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h3>Porterhouse blues</h3>

<p class="fst">An unprecedented level of corruption has been uncovered in the
richest local government borough in Britain. Westminster Council has
adopted a policy which allowed it to heavily subsidise sales of
council houses while forcing the homeless and others desperate for
houses out of the borough.</p>

<p>The aim was perhaps the most cynical conceivable: that new
home-buyers would be potential Tory voters while those renting
council property were more likely to vote Labour. So the policy was
concentrated in marginal wards, where the Tories feared they would
lose seats.</p>

<p>Empty flats in these areas were boarded up and sold at huge
discounts to those considered to be &#8216;upwardly mobile&#8217;. Great
pressure was put on those waiting for rented accommodation to buy,
and they were told if they turned down the offer they would get
nothing. Meanwhile Westminster wrote to local authorities as far away
as Wigan in Lancashire asking them to take some of Westminster&#8217;s
homeless for a pay off of &#163;400 a year per homeless person.</p>

<p>The district auditor&#8217;s report even shocked Tory MPs, who have
always boasted of Westminster&#8217;s super efficiency and regarded it as
the jewel in their local government crown. The auditor called
Westminster&#8217;s behaviour disgraceful and gerrymandering. Yet even
after this, John Major refused to condemn the action until it is
proven in court. And it took Westminster Council nearly a week to
suspend the practice after the district auditor&#8217;s report.</p>

<p>Latest damning evidence suggests that government money earmarked
to help the homeless was in fact spent on easing the gerrymandering scheme.</p>

<p>Up to &#163;20,000 was offered to tenants to vacate their council
homes to make way for the homeless &#8211; and the homes were then sold.</p>

<p>Total cost to local ratepayers is estimated at over &#163;21 million,
which the Westminster councillors involved may be surcharged to pay.
These include Dame Shirley Porter, awarded her &#8216;honour&#8217; by John
Major&#8217;s government in 1991, well after the gerrymander
investigation was under way. She is already notorious for selling
three cemeteries to a property developer for 15p.</p>

<p>It is inconceivable that this scandal was unknown either by Tories
nationally or by the Department of the Environment which awarded
Westminster the housing grants. One of those most centrally involved
in the allegations is now a Tory MP.</p>

<p>Westminster is now a symbol of everything rotten about Tory local
government. But there are already claims from Labour that Tory
Wandsworth and Brent, both in London, have been involved in similar
exercises. It remains to be seen whether any prosecutions will follow
in the Westminster fiasco.</p>
