<p class="c">The monarchy is going through its deepest crisis for many
years. <em>Judith Orr</em> and <em>Lindsey German</em> look at the truth
about the royal family</p>

<p class="fst">The heady days of the balcony kiss are a long way from headlines
proclaiming the last days of the Windsors. There is an endless
barrage of scandal and speculation about the royal family&#8217;s future.
This notorious family of hereditary millionaires, whose money
grabbing, laziness, hypocrisy and snobbery knows no bounds, is as
unpopular as it has ever been.</p>

<p>This &#8216;ideal family&#8217; has been shown badly wanting. Prince
Charles&#8217;s upbringing at the hands of the Duke of Edinburgh sounds
more like a Dickens novel than the loving family so painstakingly
portrayed in women&#8217;s magazines.</p>

<p>The royal family wants to appear as a unifier, a typical family
just like the rest of us. Part of their appeal is based on this
assumption, with some people even believing that the queen votes
Labour &#8216;like the rest of us ordinary people do&#8217;. A Labour
politician could even declare in the 1940s that &#8216;in England the
king does what the people want. He will be a socialist king.&#8217;</p>

<p>This grotesque sense of one of the richest families in the world
being just like any other is widespread and deliberately fostered by
the monarchy&#8217;s supporters. A family, some of whose main interests
are horses, full of emotionally stunted individuals whose idea of
work is just over 100 days of official engagements a year, is
projected as able to understand or be like working people.</p>

<p>The image put across is not one of feckless aristocrats but of the
dutiful, hard working middle classes, head of one not very divided
nation. People now know that the whole image is based on a lie. The
fairytale royal marriages are fakes, entered into for commercial and
public relations considerations. The parents spend only an hour or
two a day with the children, and pack them off to barbarous boarding
schools at the age of seven.</p>

<p>None of this should come as any surprise, for hypocrisy is what
the royals do best. Where else would you find someone who is a patron
of Mencap, the Royal Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and
Adults, at the same time having two severely mentally handicapped
cousins locked up in an institution, never receiving visitors for
fear the secret would come out? Then, to cover up the scandal, she
claimed they had both been dead for years! All this from the
country&#8217;s &#8216;favourite granny&#8217; whose long life is a tribute to
idleness and Gordon&#8217;s gin.</p>

<p>Charles wants us to believe he is a caring man, ill at ease with
his privileged position. Nothing could be further than the truth.</p>

<p>The royals are rich, selfish and unintelligent. Left to themselves
they would barely be able to hold a job. The queen&#8217;s personal
wealth (which excludes the millions of pounds worth of gifts from
rulers all over the globe, stored in an air raid shelter under
Buckingham Palace) is massive. Her stocks and shares are worth at
least £340 million, her jewellery a mere £3.5 million and the
hundreds of works of art which the public never sees are valued no
less than £150&#8211;200 million.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>There has always been widespread opposition to the waste of
millions of pounds of our money on these people. <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>
headlines such as &#8216;Stuff the Jubilee&#8217; and &#8216;Noddy marries
Bigears&#8217; have been among the highest sellers. Among particular
groups in society the royal family has consistently been very
unpopular. A Mass Observation survey in 1965 reported that 31 percent
of all people had more or less negative attitudes towards the
monarchy. Nearly 60 percent of all men had negative or indifferent attitudes.</p>

<p>Today there is incomparably more hostility to the monarchy than
there was then. Poll findings show that the overwhelming majority do
not want the royals to be financed out of public money and over a
third no longer want a monarchy at all. So why is Britain still
lumbered with this motley collection of the mad and bad at Buckingham Palace?</p>

<p>Some still cling to the explanation that the royals are good for
the economy because they bring in trade and tourists. A look at the
balance sheet tells a different story. The visit of the Duke of
Edinburgh to the Helsinki Trade Fair in 1970 resulted in a drop of
exports to Finland of £5.2 million by 1972. One study of royal
visits between 1971 to 1984 concluded that &#8216;the amount of time
devoted to state visits by the Queen was almost a precise reversal of
the order of the increase in trade to the places concerned&#8217;. The
country which until last month had never been visited by the royals,
Russia, increased its trade with Britain over the period fivefold,
while trade with the Commonwealth increased only by a factor of two.</p>

<p>If the royals don&#8217;t increase trade then it seems universally
accepted that tourists flock to these shores on the basis that our
palaces are still, occasionally, occupied. Yet tourism figures for
Italy and France are higher than Britain&#8217;s although they are both
republics &#8211; sunshine, good food and cheap wine being more important
features of a enjoyable holiday than the remote chance of glimpsing
Diana lunching in Mayfair.</p>

<p>A survey by the British Tourist Authority showed that the royal
family came ninth out of ten reasons for visiting Britain, just above
night life! Only 12 percent of those asked even mentioned the royal
family as a reason.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">So why do they hang on? The monarchy heads a form of parliamentary
rule which has existed for centuries. Britain has never endured
fascism or dictatorship because of its unique combination of elected
House of Commons and hereditary House of Lords and monarchy.
Dispensing with this system would lead to the danger, so the argument
goes, of dictatorship from either left or right.</p>

<p>This is the argument of many Labour leaders, who are some of the
most deferential to monarchy. Recently shadow cabinet member Mo
Mowlem even argued that the royals should get a new high-tech palace
to equip them for the 21st century!</p>

<p>The Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, writing in the 1920s,
described this feature of British politics: &#8216;The English
bourgeoisie has erased even the memory of the revolution of the 17th
century, and recast its entire past in the form of &#8220;gradual changes&#8221;.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Gradualism&#8217; permeates the trade union and labour movement,
leading to the dominant view that voting is the only way of changing
anything and nothing can be done to remove the royal family or lords,
whose roots seem to go back for centuries.</p>

<p>But the monarchy is much more modern than it looks. Most of what
we&#8217;re told now is royal ritual and tradition stretching back for
centuries goes back no further than the time of Victoria when the
monarchy often seemed in terminal decline.</p>

<p>Following the death of her husband, Prince Albert, Queen Victoria
became a virtual recluse. In 1864 a note was found pinned to the
fence of Buckingham Palace saying: &#8216;These commanding premises to be
let or sold, in consequence of the occupant&#8217;s declining business.&#8217;</p>

<p>In the end the Tory prime minister Disraeli dragged Victoria out
of retirement to counter what he saw as a rising tide of
republicanism and social unrest.</p>

<p>Her Golden jubilee became a grand state pageant on the streets of
London. Even the clergy&#8217;s outfits of &#8216;copes and coloured stoles&#8217;
on the day were an innovation. The occasion seemed to have the effect
the ruling class wished for. The Archbishop of Canterbury commented,
&#8216;days afterwards, everyone feels that the socialist movement has
had a check&#8217;.</p>

<p>The jubilee was also seen as a celebration of Britain&#8217;s empire
and was followed by Victoria&#8217;s declaration as Empress of India and
her Diamond Jubilee. Her son Edward VII continued in this tradition,
with more and more grandiose state weddings and funerals, and the
introduction of the state opening of parliament by the monarch.</p>

<p>The era of imperialism at the end of 19th century did wonders for
monarchs all over Europe. Competition between the growing capitalist
powers for colonies, exports and in the field of military might,
meant that each also competed in the power and splendour of their royalty.</p>

<p>Most European monarchies, however, did not survive the First World
War: the German, Austrian and Russian emperors were toppled by
revolution. The same fate was not to befall the House of Windsor. But
this was not because the monarchy prevented revolution. Rather the
workers&#8217; movement was not strong enough to make a revolution and so
the monarchy survived.</p>

<p>The royal family itself has sometimes had a crude understanding of
its weakness. So Edward VII was convinced that his heir George V
would be the last king of England. More recently, the abdication of
the Hitler loving Edward VIII, who became Duke of Windsor in 1936,
led to a deepening crisis for the monarchy. Then around half the
population thought it should be abolished.</p>

<p>The Second World War was very important to restoring the popular
image of a family at the head of a nation all pulling together. There
was of course no equality of sacrifice, with menus at Buckingham
Palace as sumptuous as ever, and the king and queen leaving for
Windsor nearly every night to avoid the worst bombing. Nonetheless,
the image projected helped to revive an institution which had seemed doomed.</p>

<p>The long boom and relative affluence of the 1950s and early 1960s
helped to create the accepted notion of a constitutional monarch at
the head of a united nation. Royalty&#8217;s popularity in modern times
has also been encouraged by the development of the media: the mass
circulation popular newspapers which began at the end of the last
century, the cinema newsreels, radio broadcasting and now television.
These media have always covered the royal weddings and funerals with
great reverence, reporting in the most obsequious fashion.</p>

<p>Every newspaper and television station has its gaggle of royal
reporters who churn out the line delivered to them by Buckingham
Palace without question, and have usually loyally kept any honest
information from the public. They went along with the charade of
Charles and Diana&#8217;s marriage for years.</p>

<p>The present royal family has consciously encouraged most of this
media attention. In particular since the mid 1960s, when the royal
image began to seem slightly old fashioned and tarnished, there was a
deliberate effort to make the monarchy seem relevant.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">The British monarchy is characterised more by the changes that it
has undergone over the years than by continuity. As one commentator
in the last century said, &#8216;There is hardly a country that has
succeeded in so continually adapting her medieval institutions so as
to avoid their complete overthrow or their entire reconstruction.&#8217;
In modern times the royals have accepted the need to respond to
public criticism.</p>

<p>This has most recently been seen with the Queen&#8217;s abrupt change
of heart on the length of the civil list and the paying of taxes,
following popular outrage at the announcement that the tax payer
would be paying for the refurbishment of burnt out Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>However, as each new scandal erupts, it is not a foregone
conclusion that the royals can adapt their way out of this crisis.
There is a fundamental change going on. Firstly, Britain has declined
as a great power. The royal family with all its palaces and trappings
of splendour more fitted to a huge empire, can appear anachronistic.</p>

<p>During the 1980s the repackaging of the monarchy was part of the
general conservative mood of Thatcherism. We were told Britain was
great again, economic crisis was a thing of the past, that the free
rein of the market was the only guarantee of prosperity. The sense of
betrayal and bitterness in recent years over recession, unemployment
and cuts has hit the monarchy as hard as all the other institutions
of government and control.</p>

<p>When the structures that hold society together are in such crisis
it leads to an ideological ferment even among some of the monarchy&#8217;s
strongest supporters, the Tory middle class who feel so betrayed by
the royal family&#8217;s present behaviour.</p>

<p>In such a situation any move for change can really threaten the
monarchy, which is one of the weaker of the mediating structures.
People begin to think the unthinkable, that perhaps we would be
better off without this outdated and costly form of rule. The
unfavourable media images are not solely responsible for this, but
they do help to dispel the mystique which is supposed to surround the
family. An institution whose whole existence is based on people
looking up to them has little left for it when people start holding
it in contempt. That is why there is more talk of abolition than for
at least 60 years.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">Some people believe that until this is achieved and there is an
elected presidency we cannot even get a modern democracy, but this is
to miss the point. We already have a modern capitalist democracy in a
fully developed, although declining, capitalist economy. The Glorious
Revolution of 1688 ensured that any king or queen in Britain would be
totally subservient to parliament. The House of Lords has, since
1911, been unable to block legislation passed by the Commons for any
length of time.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the king and lords &#8211; along with the church &#8211;
had absolute power. Today real power lies with the capitalist class
and its collective expression the capitalist state, of which the
monarchy and House of Lords are only component &#8211; and by no means
the central parts.</p>

<p>Part of the worry of many commentators today is that the behaviour
of the royals is upsetting the &#8216;gentlemen&#8217;s agreement&#8217; whereby
the monarchy stays so long as it doesn&#8217;t exercise real power. They
fear that disaffection with the royal family will spread to
opposition to their class in general. Some of our rulers would even
favour abolition &#8211; but they fear altering things in case it upsets
the whole of the system which they represent.</p>

<p>The future of the monarchy is intimately connected with the fate
of the capitalist class, a fact often missed by those who simply
campaign for constitutional reforms. Charter 88 is dedicated to such
reforms, and the Labour MP Tony Benn campaigns to abolish the
monarchy and the House of Lords.</p>

<p>The hereditary principle is completely reactionary and elitist,
and the principle of election much more democratic than being in a
position because an ancestor was the mistress of a king or on the
right side in a battle so we should favour such abolition.</p>

<p>But the elective democracy on offer under capitalism presents no
real alternative. The US or France are not more democratic in any
fundamental sense than Britain or Holland. Those countries spend as
much on their presidents as we are forced to on the royal family. We
know that any elected government can be remote and out of touch.</p>

<p>This is one reason why simply swopping the queen for a president
has no great appeal for most people, if it means that the rest of
their lives stay the same. A political movement which fought not for
narrow constitutional change but for a real upheaval in society &#8211;
with a new form of democracy &#8211; might seem harder to get, but it
also seems much more worth fighting for.</p>

<p>The fight to abolish the monarchy should be part of the struggle
against the system which has preserved them so generously and to
which they in turn are so devoted.</p>
