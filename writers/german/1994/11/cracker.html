<p class="fst"><strong>Cracker</strong><br/>
Mon, 9&nbsp;p.m. ITV</p>

<p class="fst">The first series of <em>Cracker</em>, starring Robbie Coltrane as
the Manchester police psychologist, held your attention but was
slightly disturbing. Coltrane&#8217;s character Fitz is much more
intelligent and liberal than the police he works with. But all his
insights into society and its victims tend to lead to the same
conclusion as black bags over people&#8217;s heads and false confessions.
In one story an innocent man is sent to prison because of Fitz&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>Those already slightly uncomfortable at the series will have felt
their unease grow with the real life acquittal of Colin Stagg. He was
charged with a particularly horrific murder after police
psychologists invented a suspect profile, fitted Stagg to that
profile without any firm evidence linking him with the crime and then
used a police woman to entrap him by encouraging him to indulge in
violent sexual fantasies.</p>

<p>Watching the opening story in the new series only tends to
reinforce this unease. A young factory worker cracks up following his
father&#8217;s death. He has an argument with an Asian shopkeeper over
4p. We are supposed to believe that he goes home, shaves his head,
returns dressed in combat gear brandishing a bayonet, argues with the
shopkeeper that he is a &#8216;robbing Paki bastard&#8217;, and then stabs
him to death.</p>

<p>In the course of the argument he claims that he is a socialist and
trade unionist who has been on marches against racism but is fed up
with the way he is treated. When he commits his second murder &#8211; of
an academic psychologist without Fitz&#8217;s insight &#8211; he again
expresses his frustration that only a handful of people went to his
dad&#8217;s funeral because he was an &#8216;ordinary white working class
bloke&#8217;. Right at the end the murderer, Albie, says that he looked
to the Labour party but they were only interested in gays and blacks.</p>

<p>What are we to make of all this? The police assume the &#8216;profile&#8217;
will be unskilled working class, unemployed, connected with a group
like the BNP. Fitz thinks differently &#8211; and the audience know that
he is right because they have seen the murderer, Albie, working in
the factory and confessing to some left wing politics in the past. So
we have to look deeper.</p>

<p>The answer, it turns out, is that he witnessed the Hillsborough
football disaster. Now, it&#8217;s perfectly understandable how that
event could completely traumatise anyone. But why should it turn them
from being a socialist into a racial killer, any more than it would
turn Michael Portillo into an SWP member?</p>

<p>There seems to be a pernicious message here: we are all racists.
Indeed, Fitz says as much to the Asian shopkeeper&#8217;s daughter. Even
the most decent, law abiding, left wing person can be sent over the
edge, and then their residual racism comes out. The horror of the
modern world can make murderous bigots of us all.</p>

<p>And here Fitz comes in. The police are portrayed sympathetically,
as decent honest people who don&#8217;t have the intelligence or insight
to spot the real criminals. Fitz is not decent or honest. He is also
a compulsive drinker and gambler in a miserable marriage who cannot
face up to the mess in his life. But his weaknesses give him an
insight into all the other misfits. He is often sympathetic to their
plight, but in the end, when Fitz has cracked their story, they are
handed over to the police.</p>

<p>The programme attempts to deal with contemporary real life issues,
but only has one law and order solution to them.</p>

<p><em>Cracker</em> has been described as a brilliant postmodern
character, portraying the exact opposite of a typical hero. But that
is hardly new in detective stories: look at the characters of
Dashiell Hammett or Raymond Chandler. The stories are well scripted
and acted, but at their core is a reactionary thesis which no radical
psychology can completely hide: the thin blue line &#8211; not perfect
but the best we have got &#8211; is the only protection of &#8216;civilisation&#8217;.</p>
