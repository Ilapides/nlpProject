<p class="fst"><strong>Fire from Heaven</strong><br/>
David Underdown<br/>
<em>Fontana &#163;7.99</em></p>

<p class="fst">It is not often that you find a history book that reads like a
novel. But David Underdown&#8217;s study of the inhabitants of a Dorset
town in the early 17th century does. It tells the story from
contemporary documents. Characters appear large as life throughout
the book. John White the preacher and William Whiteway the diarist
are the zealous campaigners and reformers, while the notorious
Pouncey family appear again and again in court records, and the
Blachfords are ruthless businessmen.</p>

<p>The town of Dorchester was largely destroyed by fire in 1613. Half
of all its buildings &#8211; around 170 houses &#8211; were burnt down. The
fire was commemorated in the town for decades afterwards, and had a
major impact on the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The &#8216;fire from heaven&#8217; of the title describes not only the
great disaster, but the sense of crusading zeal which dominated the
town in the decades which followed.</p>

<p>The book describes a physical and spiritual rebuilding of the
market town. &#8216;After the great crisis of the fire came the
recognition that what was needed was a total reformation of the
town.&#8217; The town&#8217;s views were increasingly shaped by crusading Presbyterians.</p>

<p>They created a strongly puritan world which extended beyond
religion to a wide network of charity and &#8216;improving&#8217; reforms. In
the years between the fire and the outbreak of civil war in 1642 they
established almshouses for the old and poor, a fuel house to keep the
poor warm in winter, an education system and a hospital.</p>

<p>The charitable works were aimed at creating a more orderly and
efficient society, based on religious conviction rather than simply
on wealth. They were also about regulating the poor &#8211; putting them
to work, stopping some of the old customs such as gathering firewood.
As Underdown puts it, &#8216;One side of the coin was reform: the
promotion of religion and education, the relief of the deserving. The
other side was discipline: the enforcement of personal, familial, and
communal order, and the punishment of the idle and the ungodly.&#8217;</p>

<p>This scheme resulted in perhaps the most radically religious town
in England in the 1620s and 1630s. Its Protestantism was consistently
internationalist and strongly anti-Catholic. Dorchester&#8217;s
townspeople raised large amounts of money in support of the
Protestant side in the Thirty Years War in Europe. As late as the
1650s Dorchester raised &#163;147 &#8211; a very large sum then &#8211; in
support of the Protestant victims of the Piedmont massacre, the
&#8216;slaughtered saints&#8217; of Milton&#8217;s poem. The two dates most
celebrated were the anniversary of the fire, on 6 August, and the
nationally observed Gunpowder Treason Day, 5 November.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for its supporters, this world could not survive.
The increasing political, social and religious tensions throughout
England were mirrored even in Dorchester. The poor did not like the
&#8216;godly reformation&#8217;, with its punishments for missing church or
drinking and swearing. And many of the better off were uncomfortable
with its crusading nature.</p>

<p>A number of Presbyterians left the town for New England, where the
town they founded, Dorchester, is now part of Boston. Those who
stayed found themselves at odds with national developments in
religion (the move closer to Catholicism under Archbishop Laud),
foreign policy (Charles I&#8217;s diplomacy with Catholic Spain) and
taxation, especially Ship Money.</p>

<p>When the civil war came, the town was strongly against the King
and for parliament. But its leading figures were much less happy with
the revolution that followed and with the rule of Cromwell.</p>

<p>Although the book goes up to the 1680s it is less interesting on
the civil war and the restoration, maybe because its leading
characters were fairly moderate by the standards of the 1640s. By the
1650s the town&#8217;s citizens reflect defeat, demoralisation and a loss
of ideals: less money went to charity, most collections were very
low, the poor no longer received free handouts. Religious reaction
also gathered pace.</p>

<p>Underdown has done a marvellous job in recreating 17th century
Dorchester, the customs, religion and cares of people of different
classes. Two centuries later the novelist Thomas Hardy based his town
of Casterbridge on Dorchester. By then, as Underdown says, the &#8216;fire
from heaven&#8217; had gone, and the town was described as a &#8216;hoary
place of wickedness&#8217;.</p>
