<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Fascism corresponds to Italian conditions. The
organised strength and highly developed political education of the
German working class, as well as the relative weakness of the
non-proletarian masses in Germany in comparison with Italy, make such
a brutal crushing of democracy impossible in our country.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">This statement appeared in the journal of the German Social
Democratic Party (SPD) in 1929 &#8211; only four years before Hitler
became leader of one of the most powerful capitalist nations and set
about crushing its trade unions, political parties and democratic
institutions.</p>

<p>Hitler appeared as a right wing lunatic on the political fringe,
supported by only a handful of fanatics, for much of the 1920s. How
could fascism grow from these tiny beginnings to dominate the whole
of the political scene and eventually take power? After all, there
were mass Communist and Socialist Parties in Germany and the unions
were very strong.</p>

<p>Fascism seemed an aberration, created by extreme nationalists and
racists who were in a tiny minority in the country as a whole. So for
the Nazis to come within even a chance of seizing power they had to
obtain the backing of much wider forces inside society.</p>

<p>The way in which this happened &#8211; in both Germany and Italy &#8211;
is described in great detail in one of the best books on fascism,
Daniel Guerin&#8217;s <strong>Fascism and Big Business</strong>. Guerin was a
French revolutionary socialist writing in the 1930s as he witnessed
the seemingly unstoppable rise of fascism in Italy, Germany and then Spain.</p>

<p>He explains that fascism appealed above all to those sections of
the middle classes whose lives were being ruined by big monopoly
capitalism. The German middle classes had suffered hyperinflation in
the 1920s which left many of them destitute, their savings wiped out
and investment income rendered worthless. The collapse of a number of
banks during the slump in 1931 also hit them particularly hard.</p>

<p>Fascist propaganda had a strong appeal. It spoke of restoring the
former national glory of Italy and Germany, of taming big capital and
the banks and of helping small businesses and restoring the former
prosperity of the middle classes.</p>

<p>A movement based on the middle classes alone, however, could not
have succeeded. Key sections of big capital had to throw their weight
behind Hitler in order for him to take power. Guerin points out that
capitalism does not seek fascist rule. It would far rather carry out
capital accumulation in conditions of parliamentary democracy than
under the conditions of dictatorship. Democracy is cheap. It allows a
safety valve for workers&#8217; grievances, preventing clashes between
the rulers and the ruled.</p>

<p>&#8217;When the feast is abundant, the people may safely be allowed to
pick up the crumbs&#8217;, but when economic crisis hits, things begin to
change. The capitalists need to cut wages, raise taxes and slash
welfare in order to maintain their levels of profit. Then the
democratic institutions which workers have developed can become a
hindrance to capitalist rule. &#8216;And so, in certain countries and
under certain conditions, the bourgeoisie throws its traditional
democracy overboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>The capitalist, class is not united in turning towards fascism. It
is a last resort undertaken because of the depth of the crisis.
Guerin shows that in both Italy and Germany it was the heavy
industrialists, in iron and steel and mining, plus the bankers who
funded them, who turned to fascism. The bosses of light industry were
much less enthusiastic and sometimes hostile. Heavy industry depended
much more on a level of economic nationalism or autarky, and of
course on military and related spending.</p>

<p>In Italy, Mussolini&#8217;s March on Rome, which marked his accession
to power in 1922, was financed by the heads of the Banking
Association. The leaders of the Federation of Industry and the
Federation of Agriculture telegraphed Rome that the only possible
solution was a Mussolini government.</p>

<p>German heavy industrialists were enthusiastic about the Nazis from
relatively early on. Emil Kirdorf, head of the Gelsenkirchen metal
trust, was Hitler&#8217;s &#8216;admirer&#8217; from 1927. Fritz Thyssen, the
steel magnate, regarded Hitler as his friend. &#8216;By the summer of
1930, most of the great industrialists and bankers associated with
them were underwriting the National Socialist [Nazi] party. They gave
it the formidable material resources that permitted it to win the
electoral victory of September, 1930, and gain 107 seats in the
Reichstag [parliament].&#8217;</p>

<p>Those industrialists connected with light industry feared fascism
and the consequent dominance of heavy industry, but believed they
could tame the fascists, who could be a useful parliamentary
counterbalance to the left. They soon found out that the fascists had
become an independent force who could only be combatted by armed force.</p>

<p>This mistake was echoed by much of the left. The way the left
dealt with the fascists effectively strengthened them. The main
working class parties insisted that opposition to the fascists had to
come through parliamentary and constitutional channels. Sometimes the
left and the liberals even helped the fascists to gain a respectable
parliamentary base. The liberal Italian politician Giolitti
incorporated the fascists into a bloc of government parties,
resulting in the election of 30 fascists in 1921. He later wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Fascism already represented a real force in our
national life, and, according to my old principle that every
political force in the nation should express itself in parliament, it
was desirable that fascism should have parliamentary representation.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Mussolini used the election results as a springboard to build his
power and to gain a breathing space. He used the time to build
fascist gangs, terrorise his opponents and launch his successful bid
for power in 1922. Even after this, however, he was careful to
pretend that he respected parliamentary democracy until he felt
strong enough to crush it in 1924.</p>

<p>Hitler&#8217;s strategy was similar. He used the election campaigns in
order to build his support, claiming &#8211; like many of today&#8217;s
fascists &#8211; to be just another right wing patriot. In the meantime
he built up his gangs of stormtroopers who terrorised Jews,
Communists and trade unionists.</p>

<p>The Nazis were treated as a constitutional party, and Hitler only
became chancellor in January 1933 with the agreement and collusion of
right wing constitutional politicians. Even at this stage the main
left wing parties stressed the need for calm and order. Otto Wels, a
Socialist leader, said, &#8216;The people will have the opportunity on 5
March [the election date] to take its destiny into its own hands.&#8217;</p>

<p>But the fascists used their position to prevent the left gaining
in the election. The state of emergency declared after the &#8216;Reichstag
fire&#8217; (when parliament was burnt down and the Communists were
blamed) at the end of February led to Nazi stormtroopers becoming
auxiliary police who tortured or killed militant workers,
anti-fascist parties could not hold meetings and Communist deputies
were arrested. The Nazis did well in the elections, and ensured an
absolute majority by outlawing the Communists and sending some
Socialist deputies to concentration camps. In the months that
followed all democratic organisations were brutally suppressed.</p>

<p>The Nazis had used their democratic platforms to destroy all
democracy, just as Mussolini had before them. Hitler summed up the
fatal flaw in the anti-fascist strategy:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Only one thing could have broken our movement &#8211; if
the adversary had understood its principle and from the first day had
smashed, with the most extreme brutality, the nucleus of our new movement.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Instead the Nazis were given crucial time both to put on a
respectable face and to use the armed bands of stormtroopers to smash
up union offices and intimidate militants.</p>

<p>Could it have been any different? Guerin argues very persuasively
yes. Firstly, the workers&#8217; movements in Italy and Germany could
have been mobilised to prevent the fascists&#8217; growth. Divisions
among the different workers&#8217; parties, a sense that parliamentary
opposition was enough, and of political complacency all contributed
to defeat.</p>

<p>Nor was it automatic that the middle classes would back fascism.
They had good reasons to hate the capitalist system and big business,
which had ruined them. But the middle classes had no coherent
strategy or class politics of their own and were therefore dragged in
the wake of one or the other of the main classes. Tragically, the
working class did not develop the successful struggles which could
have given a lead and a sense of confidence to sections of the middle classes.</p>

<p>The victorious fascists were careful not to seriously damage the
privileges of the capitalist class. This led to tensions among their
supporters, who had been fed anti-capitalist rhetoric. In both Italy
and Germany the fascist leaders turned on their popular base when it
became any sort of challenge to big capitalism. In Italy the fascist
militias were integrated into the regular army.</p>

<p>In Germany, Hitler eventually had to physically crush his
stormtroopers, with the full backing of the capitalists. Two days
after Hitler visited the arms manufacturer, Krupp, in June 1934, he
carried out the Night of the Long Knives, having many of his oldest
fascist collaborators shot. From then on the main support of the
fascist dictatorship was the regular army. This and the German
capitalist class backed Hitler right to the end of the war in 1945.</p>

<p>The great strength of Guerin&#8217;s book is its demonstration that
fascism was never inevitable &#8211; its rise was due to the failure of
the class struggle and the weaknesses of the workers&#8217; parties. The
German revolutionary Clara Zetkin wrote in 1923, &#8216;Fascism is the
punishment inflicted on the proletariat for not having continued the
revolution begun in Russia.&#8217; We have to relearn that lesson today.</p>
