<p class="fst">Women are more visible than they have ever been in history. They
perform much of the paid labour of the world and the majority of the
unpaid labour. Women work the majority of total hours in the world,
but work much less than men do for pay &#8211; and when they are paid
they receive less wages. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> Women&#8217;s role in working outside the
home raises their profile in all sorts of ways: they work in
factories, in offices, driving buses and taxis. They socialise
outside their home and family. They travel on public transport. They
join unions and go on strike. And where there is protest there are
likely to be women. In Britain the number of young women taking part
strikes everyone who has been on the huge anti-war and
anti-capitalist demonstrations. Women wearing the Muslim hijab mingle
with those in miniskirts and fcuk tops. Picket lines of nursery
nurses and council workers, but also of firefighters and post office
workers, have strong representations of women. British Airways
workers at Heathrow who went on strike showed that workers can wear
uniforms and make-up and still be militant. School students who
struck against the war in Iraq were usually led by women who showed
themselves to be the most articulate and intelligent of the new
generation. The new movements that we are witnessing are also
movements of women. They stand in strong contrast to many of the
older women who purport to represent them. The female cabinet
ministers like Patricia Hewitt, the women executives and
professionals who claim to represent the advance of feminism, have
nothing to offer these women and are usually totally hostile to their
aspirations and political views.</p>

<p>But women&#8217;s public profile has not led to equality or an end to
oppression. More freedom about sex has all too often meant
exploitation rather than liberation. The obsession with the body
which dominates society leads to women starving themselves and then
binging on food, or paying large sums of money to enlarge breasts,
straighten noses and temporarily banish wrinkles. Lapdancing clubs
and lad magazines have become the new symbols of male chauvinism. The
awareness of rape fostered by the women&#8217;s movement in the 1970s
created at least some understanding that &#8216;whatever we say, wherever
we go, yes means yes and no means no&#8217;. Now we are again confronted
with the view that women&#8217;s behaviour means that they &#8216;asked for
it&#8217; in some appalling rape cases. While far more women report rape
now than in the late 1970s, the rate of conviction has fallen from 32
percent to 10 percent. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> Women are constantly told that they can&#8217;t
have it all, but they are expected to do it all: be successful career
women, devoted mothers, gourmet cooks, intelligent conversationalists
and fantastic lovers. Financial independence remains an illusion when
women earn at least a fifth less than men for the same jobs.
Political equality is distant: women were very much at the heart of
leading the anti-war movement in Britain, but in many campaigns men
are over-represented. Platforms at events such as the European Social
Forum are still heavily dominated by older white men. And while
society may look equal in some areas, the closer you get to the
powerful capitalist institutions like parliament or the City of
London, the more male dominated they are.</p>

<p>Women in Britain are no longer expected to be sexually docile.
They are encouraged by advertising and by a series of glamorous and
high-profile images of women to make their sex lives exotic and
adventurous. They are expected to have children at some point in
their lives, but are not usually frowned upon if they do not. They
are more likely than not to experience sexual relations before
marriage, and are also likely to divorce. They marry later and have
fewer children than their grandparents or great-grandparents. Girls
are encouraged to prepare themselves for a career on the same basis
as boys. But they carry their oppression into these changed sexual
and social relations. Men are still on top metaphorically if not
physically. Greater sexual freedom is a huge step forward for many
women but it is still very far from genuine freedom and equality.</p>

<p>We have reached a stage in women&#8217;s social development which
would have been unthinkable only 50 years ago. Yet liberation is as
far away as ever in the sense that it was developed as a theory and a
strategy more than 30 years ago. That early movement was not mainly
or even at all concerned with establishing more women managers or
even female MPs. Instead it aimed to bring a greater sexual equality
linked with what was widely recognised as the necessity of social
change which could allow the development of women&#8217;s liberation.</p>
<p>The women&#8217;s movement began in the US and grew out of the great
movements for social justice which dominated the 1960s there. Women
had been involved in the civil rights movement, in the movement
against the Vietnam War, in the &#8216;new left&#8217; and in the student
movement. They could not help but analyse their own oppression in
similar terms to these other movements. The &#8216;women&#8217;s liberation
workshop&#8217; which met in June 1967 articulated women&#8217;s position as
&#8216;a colonial relationship to men&#8217;, drawing an analogy with the
Vietnamese or blacks in Africa, and concluding that therefore they
had to fight for their independence: &#8216;Only the independent woman
can be truly effective in the larger revolutionary struggle&#8217;. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>
The women&#8217;s movement was seen as part of bringing wider social change.</p>

<p>This was even more true in Britain. Who now remembers that women&#8217;s
liberation in Britain was very closely linked to the working class
movement and to strikes? The dispute of Ford women workers for equal
pay and that of the London night cleaners became well known, and
celebrated as signs of women taking action to achieve equality. There
were many other strikes at the time involving women: the teachers in
1969, the post office telephonists in 1971, and the Leeds clothing
workers in 1970. It was the time of a growing and militant working
class movement, and although the really big battles of that movement
mainly involved men such as the miners and dockers, women&#8217;s
new-found militancy could not be ignored. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>The women&#8217;s movement in Britain, unlike its much larger
counterpart in the US, was influenced by this level of class struggle
and by the working class movement. The input of socialists and trade
unionists was much more apparent and more dominant in the movement as
a whole than in the US. The movement also had as its backdrop the
substantial legislative changes of the late 1960s and early 1970s:
the legalisation of abortion, the easing of divorce, the
decriminalisation of gay sex between consenting adults, and the laws
introduced to implement equal pay and an end to sex discrimination.</p>

<p>Why has the early promise of liberation not been fulfilled, as
many expected it would be? Women&#8217;s entry into the workforce and
their achievement of greater sexual freedom were rightly seen as
striking great blows against women&#8217;s oppression. But within
capitalism the conditions under which these changes were achieved and
the wider society in which they have developed tell us everything
about why they fell far short of liberation. There has been a huge
change in women&#8217;s work worldwide: in countries such as China,
Thailand and Indonesia rapid industrialisation has turned women into
workers in factories and sweatshops in a modern parallel of the
industrial revolution which transformed Britain 200 years ago. But
many women from the poorer countries have to travel much further than
from the country to the city. As well as making up a high proportion
of the working class in their native countries, they all too often
have to travel across the world in order to make a living. Migrant
labour, much of it female, has brought women to work cleaning the
houses of, caring for the children of or servicing sexually the
Western middle classes. In the richest countries, women have been
pulled into clerical work and retail work on an unprecedented scale,
reflecting the growth of service industries in these countries over
the past half-century. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> All of these situations may have led to
higher incomes or more independence (although this is by no means
always the case) but they have all too often increased pressures on
women, making their lives in some ways closer to men&#8217;s, with all
the stresses that entails.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A woman&#8217;s work</h4>

<p class="fst">Women&#8217;s work has changed forever in the past 30 years and there
seems to be no turning back. Women can no longer be seen as a
peripheral part of the workforce. During the 1970s and early 1980s it
was commonly claimed that women had been brought into the workforce
in a time of boom and that when recession hit these workers would be
the first to be made redundant. Women, it was said, were disposable
workers in a way that men were not, and would be pushed back into the
home. Their role in domestic labour and the part time nature of
women&#8217;s work would ensure that they were used as a reserve army of
labour, content to stay outside the labour market in times of
recession. So Anna Coote and Beatrix Campbell could write in 1982
that &#8216;the great post-war boom in female employment has been
abruptly halted and thrown into reverse&#8217;. Women, they argued,
&#8216;still represent a &#8220;reserve army of labour&#8221;, to be called up
and disbanded again, according to the vagaries of the economic and
political climate&#8217;. To Coote and Campbell, &#8216;Men are designated
&#8220;real&#8221; workers. Women are not. Not only is their &#8220;right&#8221; to
work illusory, but their foothold in the labour market is far more
tenuous than they have supposed&#8217;. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p>While this analysis has proved to be wrong, women have become a
workforce characterised by low pay. And the working conditions of men
and women, part time and full time, have noticeably worsened during
the 1990s. The labour market has proved to be sex blind in the sense
that women continued to be drawn into the workforce at an increasing
rate while the bulk of job losses fell in areas which were heavily
male dominated. The reasons for this were twofold: the structural
changes in British employment led to a decline in manufacturing
employment and a growth in various forms of service industry. Because
of the occupational segregation of work in Britain, new jobs were
increasingly likely to go to women. The second reason, however, was
that the employers saw women as a pliant and flexible workforce.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the 21st century 70 percent of British women
were in paid jobs, the largest proportion ever. This amounted to 12.5
million, an increase of nearly a million on ten years previously. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>
This increase in women working has only been made possible by more
and more mothers going back to paid work rather than staying at home
to look after their children. So a majority of women with children
under five now work outside the home, and 65 percent of all women
with dependent children do so. Nearly half of all single mothers are
in work and almost a third of single mothers with children under five
have some sort of paid work. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> Of those women born in the first
decade of the 20th century, only 30 percent who had children were
working at the age of 30. Of those born between 1960 and 1963, 54
percent of those with children were. Sixty seven percent of all women
aged 30 worked in 1993 (compared to 48 percent in 1963). <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p>While historically the biggest constraint on women continuing to
work throughout their lives was motherhood, this is less and less the
case. The maintenance of full time work patterns for large numbers of
mothers is one of the biggest changes that has taken place: &#8216;The
number of women who work during pregnancy and return to work within
nine to 11 months of the birth of their child has increased
dramatically in recent years&#8217;. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a> Women with children are also
working longer hours than previously, and the rate of increase for
those with dependent children has grown faster than for those without
children, with mothers of children under five increasing their
average weekly work by four hours between 1984 and 1994. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> There
is no single reason why this change &#8211; which shows absolutely no
sign of reversing &#8211; came about. The greater availability and
acceptance by employers of maternity leave, women&#8217;s desire or need
for continuous employment especially in certain competitive work, and
the desire to return for personal and social reasons are some.
However, the main reason that mothers go out to work is economic. The
importance of women&#8217;s earnings to family income increased markedly
in the post-war boom. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> This increasing dependence on the female
wage at least in part explains the increase in full time working for mothers.</p>

<p>Women in lower income groups have gone out to work to compensate
for the low and sometimes falling wages of many working class men.
Whereas before the 1980s the wives of higher-income men saw their
employment increase most rapidly, from the 1980s onwards it was those
wives of lower-income men who increased their employment fastest. The
share of family income contributed by women grew fastest among
families where men had low or median earnings. Without women&#8217;s pay,
the rate of poverty among married or cohabiting couples in the early
1990s would have been more than 50 percent higher than it actually
was. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p>The 1980s and 1990s marked an increase in the rate of exploitation
for very large numbers of working people. Conditions worsened
dramatically in some areas: people worked longer hours or were forced
to accept split shifts which took up a great deal of what should have
been leisure time in the working day. The introduction of greater
&#8216;flexibility&#8217; in the workplace led to the abolition of certain
rights such as tea breaks. In some industries wages were actually cut
&#8211; for example as a result of privatisation, where public sector
jobs were reassigned at lower rates of pay, or in industries such as
printing and journalism where the union-busting operations of Rupert
Murdoch and Eddie Shah led to a general lowering of wages and
worsening of conditions across the whole sector. Women were moving
into work at precisely the time when unions were being weakened and
established conditions and agreements were being torn up. The
prospect of universal and affordable childcare, of decent conditions
and of real improvements in women&#8217;s lives appeared even more remote
than it had done one or two decades previously. Now women were being
told that they had to work, that childcare while they worked was
their responsibility, and that it was also their responsibility to
equip themselves to enter the labour market. On top of that they
still had their family responsibility. The term &#8216;double burden&#8217;
doesn&#8217;t begin to describe this situation.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Childcare</h4>

<p class="fst">If the health service was run on the same basis as childcare in
Britain, people would be lying bleeding to death in the streets and
the vast majority of patients would have to rely on relatives or paid
volunteers who already had to care for other sick people. Yet we
expect millions of children of working mothers to be cared for by
grandparents and other relatives, friends and other unpaid carers.
The bulk of paid childcare is performed by registered childminders,
often themselves mothers who cannot work outside the home. Only a
small minority are cared for in nurseries or other childcare
institutions. The post-war retreat on nursery provision and the ease
with which part time work could be fitted in with childcare meant
that publicly funded childcare provision never accompanied the
post-war boom. Since the mid-1970s the consistent attempts to cut
back on public spending have also meant that any universal and
publicly provided childcare system has been denied to the millions of
working women who could benefit from it. A major reason for mothers
not working is lack of affordable childcare. One study showed that a
third of women who did not return to work after having a baby said
they could not earn enough to pay for childcare. Of mothers who did
not work, nearly a quarter said they would work full time with the
childcare of their choice and a further 55 percent said they would
work part time. Only 19 percent of non-working mothers said they
would not work even with the childcare of their choice. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> The gap
between supply and demand has been calculated by the Daycare Trust as
one registered childcare place for every 7.5 children under eight
years old in England. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> Although the vast majority of three and
four year olds now have some form of nursery education, this is
mostly not full time. The market rules in childcare, with miserly
levels of full time state provision and with the onus placed on
parents to find the resources &#8211; both family and financial &#8211; to
pay for it. Childcare costs in Britain are the highest in Europe. At
mid-1990s levels it was estimated that the cost of childcare for two
children, one pre-school and one older, was £6,000 a year. It is
estimated that parents meet 93 percent of childcare costs. Single
parents who worked in the early 1990s were spending nearly a quarter
of their earnings on childcare. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> A typical nursery place now
costs £6,200 a year. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p>Promises by the Labour government to dramatically increase the
amount and quality of childcare have not materialised. The shortfall
in childcare is worse than in any other EU country, and the expense
of what provision is available puts a heavy burden on working
mothers, with some spending a quarter of their wages on care. There
are just eight day nursery places for every 100 children under five.
In the case of 62 percent of pre-school children and 77 percent of
school-age children, parents use informal childcare by neighbours,
friends and relatives. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a> After-school clubs are available for only
one in 14 of school-age children. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> The solution to this problem
was that &#8216;grandmothers would be paid for looking after their
grandchildren under plans being drawn up by ministers to get more
single parents back to work&#8217;, according to the <b>Financial Times</b>.
<a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a> One of the consequences of the failure of childcare has been the
much lower level of workforce participation of single mothers
compared with mothers in relationships. While, as we have seen above,
mothers in couples have dramatically increased their work
participation, this has not been the case for single mothers. A major
reason for this is the lack of free or cheap childcare, making paid
work barely worth doing for single women who cannot command an
above-average salary. So 61 percent of single mothers do not work,
and the problem barely changes when children first attend school,
since mothers are still responsible for childcare before and after
the school day and cannot work full time. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a> However, it is
especially acute for mothers of under-fives, with less than a third
of these single mothers in paid work. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a> Funding of childcare
demonstrates the problems of scarcity, inefficiency and high cost:
the vast majority comes from private individuals. Of total sector
funding, £190 million comes from private companies, £50 million
from miscellaneous sources, £150 million directly from the
government and a gigantic £1,655 million from private individuals
(of which £110 million is from government indirect subsidies). <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a>
So childcare becomes a tax on working men and women, which is often
simply too onerous for them to afford.</p>

<p>Decent professional childcare over long hours is very expensive,
making it a struggle even for many professionals. Live-in childcare
is concentrated among the rich. &#8216;The scarcity of nannies has driven
up salaries and perks, making them the preserve of the very wealthy&#8217;.
<a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> A study that took place in 1990 drew the conclusion that
&#8216;practically all nannies or mothers&#8217; helps looked after children
of professionals, employers and managers&#8217;. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a> The director of a
charity, earning with her partner more than the £58,000 a year which
would allow them tax credits, was quoted in the <b>Financial Times</b>
as paying her nanny £250 a week to look after her two children full
time. It is estimated that parents living in London have to set aside
£35,000 gross income to pay for a professional nanny &#8211; as much as
or more than the combined income of most working couples. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a>
Nannies tend to care for pre-school children for the longest hours in
any particular day, followed by registered childminders. Nannies are
more likely to start early, finish late, and work five days a week.
&#8216;Informal&#8217; (or unpaid) childcare with neighbours or friends is
much more likely to be for shorter hours during the day and for one
or two days a week. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> Income plays a large part in securing
childcare and for many women this determines the work that they do:
commuting and long hours are obviously much more difficult for women
with young children unless they have sufficient income to pay for
professional care over a long period of the day. Lack of childcare
therefore often means relying on unpaid sources or limited paid
provision, which in turn means working relatively near to home and
often part time. For many working class families unpaid childcare is
often the only option. The majority of pre-school children are looked
after informally, mainly by fathers and grandmothers, when the mother
is not there. When it comes to working mothers, the nature of
childcare varies greatly according to class. The proportion using
fathers and grandparents is much higher among manual workers than
among professionals and managers. While 29 percent of professionals&#8217;
and 27 percent of managers&#8217; children are cared for by fathers, 45
percent of children of skilled manual and 50 percent of children from
semi-skilled manual families are cared for by them. Grandparents are
the carers for 18 percent of children of professionals and 25 percent
of children of managers and employers. This rises rapidly among
intermediate and junior non-manual to 44 percent, the same proportion
as the children of skilled manual workers. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p>The family and the unskilled labour within it are still the scene
of much childcare. The proportion of childcare paid for by the
working class directly or provided free by their services in the home
shows how successful the capitalist class has been in forcing working
people to carry the costs of increased childcare involved in such a
big expansion of the workforce. The burden this puts on individual
families and the direct contribution it makes to continuing women&#8217;s
oppression are very great.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Poles apart</h4>

<p class="fst">The class divisions within childcare reflect the wider class
divisions within the female workforce. Many women now see their life
as defined by their relationship to the labour market, but they don&#8217;t
all come to the labour market in the same way. It is commonly assumed
that there is a polarisation in work between those in full time
careers and those in casualised, low paid and part time work. This is
one division but a more important one has taken place in women&#8217;s
work. A minority of women have risen up the ladder of success over
the past two decades and now comprise the growing number of higher
professionals, middle and higher managers, and business executives.
They command salaries beyond the dreams of most working class women
and men, and they find themselves in an increasing and often direct
conflict with those they employ or supervise &#8211; often women. On the
other hand, the mass of working women have found the pressure of work
intensified as they enter the labour market in ever greater numbers.
This pressure occurs in the supermarkets and call centres, but also
in the more traditional &#8216;female professions&#8217; such as nursing or
teaching. Those in routine full time work are closer to those in part
time and low paid work than they are to those in higher managerial or
professional jobs. This is true in terms of wages and conditions as
well as the fact that many women will move between the two in the
course of their working lives.</p>

<p>This pattern was already under way nearly two decades ago. A
perceptive commentary at the time talked of the double-edged nature
of women&#8217;s employment in 1988: &#8216;Women&#8217;s employment has been
protected and expanded not because women are progressively overcoming
their relative disadvantage in the labour market, but because of the
continued existence of these disadvantages which causes them to be an
attractive source of labour supply to employers for particular types
of jobs.&#8217; Women were beginning to secure their position in the
labour market &#8216;by becoming more stable and continuous participants
in the labour force and by actively increasing their levels of
qualifications pre and post entry to the labour market&#8217;. But that
would benefit only a minority, &#8216;with the employment conditions for
the majority deteriorating while an increasing minority acquire more
of the characteristics ... traditionally reserved for male labour&#8217;. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p>A minority of women have gained substantial rewards in terms of
income, status and the ability to pay for others to perform personal
services such as childcare and cleaning. This minority have seen real
advances as traditionally male areas have been opened up to women.
Today a woman heads the London Stock Exchange and a third of all
managers and administrators are women. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a> In 1997, 52 percent of
new solicitors were women, 32 percent of managers and administrators,
34 percent of health professionals and 27 percent of buyers, brokers
and sales reps. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> This has been marked by a dramatic increase over
two decades. Whereas in 1974 only 2 percent of directors and managers
were women, by 2000 women made up 22 percent of this category. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a>
However, these women have tended to accept the traditional ideology
that they cannot take into account any of the aspects of being a
woman that might put them at a disadvantage. A survey of executive
women throughout Europe demonstrated that childcare benefits were
their lowest priorities because &#8216;they simply want to earn good
money and make their own decisions about how to solve their childcare
issues&#8217;. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a> Whatever their disadvantages in relation to men of
their class, the relationship of these women to most working class
women is managerial and often adversarial. The women in designer
suits who drive expensive cars have become a part of working life &#8211;
and most working class women are discovering that they get no special
favours from women managers.</p>

<p>Then there are the other women in suits &#8211; this time the cheaper
mass-produced ones from Next or BHS &#8211; or in uniforms. These are the
mass of office workers, the uniformed bank and building society
clerks, the nurses, the workers in Sainsbury&#8217;s or Tesco. Add to
them the teachers, childcare and welfare workers, the very young and
female workforce in the call centres, and you have much of the female
working class today. There are over 400,000 workers in call centres,
large numbers of them women. The fastest-growing occupations
throughout the 1990s tended to contain disproportionately high
numbers of women: sales assistants and receptionists, education and
health service workers, care assistants, welfare workers and nursery
nurses. The fastest-growing single occupation was hairdressing.</p>

<p>These women in the majority are low paid, they are often engaged
in routine and repetitive work, and they are subject to many of the
traditional controls over work which were once confined to manual
workers. Computerisation means that managers know exactly what a
worker is doing at any one time. The introduction of machinery into
office work has transformed the nature of work, with photocopiers
playing the role of printers and word processors monitoring work, and
nearly all work being tied to a machine. In shops the checkouts
measure speed of throughput and act as stocktakers, placing new
orders as they mark what is being sold. Even work which was once
considered part of the professions &#8211; such as nursing, lecturing or
teaching &#8211; is now subject to much greater managerial control, with
many of the disciplines of the traditional factory job.</p>

<p>There is no fundamental difference in job description and lack of
control between these workers and those who work part time. As we
have seen, increasing numbers of women work full time when they are
able to do so, but there are real barriers towards them doing so all
the time. Low pay, childcare and other caring responsibilities mean
that for at least part of their working lives many women will work
part time. The sociologist Catherine Hakim has argued that most women
are not interested in careers and prefer to centre their lives round
childcare and home responsibilities. Only a minority of women, she
says, want to work full time in high-powered jobs. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a> This argument
only serves to justify the <i>status quo</i>, with its existing gap
between high paid women and those part-timers who are presumably
happy in their low-wage, low-status jobs. But the connection between
part time working and family responsibilities is overwhelming. While
care in the home remains privatised, millions of women will continue
to work part time regardless of their aspirations, because they have
no alternative. The historic Women and Employment survey of 1980 &#8211;
the biggest survey of women and work &#8211; showed that women working
part time were more likely to be in &#8216;women only&#8217; jobs. Over half
of women part time workers finished work by 4&nbsp;p.m. to pick up
the kids from school. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> Of those couples with children, women who
worked part time were more likely to work evenings than those working
full time. Nearly one in 20 women part-timers with children also
worked nights, suggesting that mothers take part time work when
fathers or other members of the family can care for the children.
<a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a> Satisfaction with part time jobs is clearly relative: a 1990s
study showed that women part timers were overqualified for their
jobs. Over half of women part-timers said that given their
qualifications and experience they could expect a better job. They
were less likely than full-timers to say their current job was the
one they liked best. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a> There have been increases in recent years
in the number of part-timers who would prefer a full time job. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a>
Much has been made of the satisfaction which part time women feel in
their jobs, and undoubtedly many do. But as Martin and Roberts,
authors of the survey, commented, &#8216;In some ways it is not
surprising that such a high proportion of part time workers were
happy with their hours of work; unless they can find a job with
suitable hours they are unlikely to be able to work at all&#8217;. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p>Women&#8217;s wages &#8211; despite over 30 years of equal pay legislation
&#8211; still lag behind men&#8217;s. In 1998 women earned on average £6.67
per hour, 75 percent of men&#8217;s hourly average of £8.94. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a> The
distribution of female earnings tells how far away from equal pay
women in Britain still are, despite real improvements. For a
significant minority of women it is possible to earn as much as or
even more than men. A fifth of women now earn more than their working
partners, compared with one in 14 in the 1970s. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a> This testifies
to the growth of a section of women able to earn as much as or more
than at least some men. But it is not the main picture. Even by the
mid-1990s, 20 percent of women earned less than or equal to the
bottom 10 percent of men. Another more than 20 percent earned equal
to the second lowest 10 percent of men. Only 3 percent of women
earned equal to the top 10 percent of earners. Around three quarters
of women fell into the bottom half of male pay distribution. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a></p>

<p>Work has not held the key to liberation for women; rather it has
meant exploitation on a similar basis to men, with the added burden
of work in the home. While a minority have benefited from the
conditions of the past two decades, the large majority of women are
concentrated in some of the poorest jobs and in the worst conditions.
The level of inequality is growing wider, and this includes
inequality among women themselves.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The great leap forward</h4>

<p class="fst">The impact on personal lives of the change in women&#8217;s work
patterns has been dramatic. Only half a century ago marriage was
regarded as the only path to respectability for a woman. A child born
outside marriage was viewed as a terrible and shameful burden in many
families. Monogamy in relationships was promoted in women&#8217;s
magazines, by church, state and government. Geoffrey Gorer, author of
a study in the early 1950s, regarded English sexual attitudes as
remarkable. He wrote, &#8216;I very much doubt whether the study of any
other urban population would produce comparable figures of chastity
and fidelity&#8217;. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a> Yet in 1997 there were 310,000 marriages, one
of the lowest figures in the 20th century, of which only 181,000 were
first marriages &#8211; a decline of more than half since 1970. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a> The
proportion of women aged 18 to 49 cohabiting has more than doubled in
the past two decades from 11 percent to 29 percent. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a> Divorce
rates in Britain are twice as high as in any other EU country. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a>
Teenage pregnancies are the highest in Europe &#8211; twice as high as
Germany, three times as high as France and six times those of the
Netherlands. <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p>What happened to bring about this change? There were two major
advances in women&#8217;s sexual behaviour during the 20th century. One
was during the Second World War, where industrial and military
conscription gave women sexual opportunities not previously available
to them, and the dangers of war lent a greater urgency to
relationships. But while this change had dramatic effects on divorce
rates and numbers of children born outside marriage, the dominant
post-war morality stressed domesticity and home-centredness. That
this ideology was in increasing contrast with reality became fully
apparent in the 1960s, which marked the real leap forward in terms of
attitudes to sexuality and relationships. But this time the change
was permanent and only deepened over time.</p>

<p>The movements and attitudes of the 1960s &#8211; at the heart of which
is the sexual revolution &#8211; were a rebellion of young against old,
in a society where the old had dominated the young for generations.
Now all the attitudes were subverted &#8211; the work ethic, the
patriotism, the deference and of course the sexual conservatism. The
young were in a position where they did not have to just submit to
the wishes of the old:</p>

<p class="quoteb">[In the early 1960s] there were a million more unmarried
people in the age range 15 to 24 than ten years previously &#8211; a 20
percent increase. And they wielded a new economic power. Average real
wages increased by 25 percent between 1938 and 1958, but those of
adolescents by twice this. And though they disposed of only some 5
percent of total consumer spending, they were the biggest purchasers
of certain commodities &#8211; 42 percent of record players, 29 percent
of cosmetics and toiletries, 28 percent of cinema admissions. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At the same time, they tended to be dependent on their parents
longer, through the raising of the school leaving age and the
broadening of higher education. This led to greater tensions between
parents and their children. So too did the more open attitude to sex,
denounced as &#8216;permissiveness&#8217; by much of society and the subject
of continued controversy and debate. For most young people there were
still many restrictions on sex. However, sexual intercourse was
taking place at a younger age. So whereas for women born between 1931
and 1935 the median age of first intercourse was 21, for those born
between 1941 and 1945 the median had fallen to 19 years. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a> But
sexual experience for many does not appear to have changed too much.
As a survey done in the mid-1960s showed, for most people early
sexual experience was often conducted by trial and error. Sex &#8216;just
happened&#8217;: when penetrative sex occurred for the first time it was
unpremeditated for four fifths of girls and boys. By age 15, only one
in 50 girls and one in 20 boys had had intercourse. First intercourse
was not pleasurable for half of boys and two thirds of girls. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a>
But the fact was that many taboos in behaviour had been lifted by the
1960s. Marriage tended to be at a younger age and by 1972 one in
three of those marrying who had not previously been married were
teenagers. Figures from 1969&#8211;1970 showed that one third of teenage
brides were pregnant and 43 percent of all premaritally conceived
births were to teenagers. In addition only 54 percent of births
conceived premaritally were legitimised by marriage in the period
1964&#8211;1970. Illegitimate births were at 5.8 percent in 1961
(following 5 percent in 1951) &#8211; by 1976 the rate was 9 percent.
<a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a> This does not necessarily suggest a greater awareness of
sexuality or of control over women&#8217;s own bodies, but it does
suggest a much greater willingness to reject &#8216;old-fashioned morals&#8217;.</p>

<p>There were three major changes in women&#8217;s lives which began to
have an influence on their attitudes. First a small minority gained
access to higher education. There they encountered on the one hand
liberal attitudes on a whole range of issues which encouraged them to
think differently about their role as women. Did they have to see
their future as marriage and motherhood or were there alternatives at
least for educated and independent women? On the other hand, they
were subject to petty restrictions on their lifestyles and sex lives
which created great frustration and anger. Women undergraduates who
were caught with a man in their room could be expelled from the
college. In France the restrictions on men visiting women&#8217;s rooms
were one of the issues which led directly to the great student
explosion of May 1968. <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a> The second issue was the greater control
by women over their own bodies which for the first time in history
made it possible to separate out procreation from sexual enjoyment.
The third major change was women&#8217;s greater financial and social independence.</p>

<p>The 1960s also produced the great social movements for change
which marked the first major challenge to the post-war consensus in
the West. Out of these movements came those for women&#8217;s liberation
and gay liberation and these helped to ensure that the questioning of
the old order brought with it a new sexual radicalism. The more open
moral climate of the 1970s met with a backlash. The second half of
the 1970s saw successive attempts to restrict abortion. James
Callaghan&#8217;s Labour government stressed the need for a strong family
and for a return to more conventional education. The AIDS epidemic
which began in the early 1980s was used as a means of attacking gay
sex in particular.</p>

<p>There was a growing clash between the attitudes expressed by
authority in society and people&#8217;s real circumstances, their jobs
and how they lived their lives. People had experienced open sexual
relationships and they were determined not to give them up. So by the
1990s bigoted measures such as Section 28 of the Local Government
Act, which banned the &#8216;promoting of homosexuality&#8217; in schools,
could continue to coexist alongside the creation of much larger and
more open gay communities, at least in big cities such as London and
Manchester. Government ministers could spout the virtues of the
family while marriages fell to record lows and more people than ever
lived outside the traditional family.</p>

<p>Sex and sexuality had been separated from procreation, so people
quite rightly asked, why can&#8217;t we gain sexual enjoyment in the way
that we want &#8211; and what does it have to do with anyone apart from
the individuals concerned? Whereas for previous generations there
were all sorts of material constraints on sexual experimentation, by
the 1980s and 1990s there were far fewer. Young people had more time,
money and independence than their grandparents or parents.
Particularly important in this were young women. Women have expressed
an interest in sex which has shocked many people, but which is surely
the natural outcome of a young generation with the usual interest in
sex, but with the ability to do something about it. Women&#8217;s
assertiveness in this situation is a demand for the right to be
treated equally with men, sexually as well as legally or financially.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the 21st century there were clear enough signs
to point to certain permanent trends in love, marriage and sexuality.
It was no longer the norm for people to abstain from sex before
marriage &#8211; those who &#8216;saved themselves&#8217; for marriage became a
smaller and smaller minority. <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a> Marriage itself had changed
dramatically Whereas for some of the 19th century and much of the
20th premarital sex was taboo, now the norm was a form of &#8216;trial
marriage&#8217; with few social sanctions on either side if they broke
the relationship &#8211; especially if children were not yet involved.
Whereas in the 1950s only 1 percent of women in Britain marrying for
the first time lived with the man for an extended period, by the
early 1980s this rose to 21 percent. <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a> Of those born between 1933
and 1942 in the US, 84.5 percent of men and 93.8 percent of women
said they married without living with their partner beforehand; of
those born between 1963 and 1974 &#8211; only 30 years later &#8211; these
figures had slumped to 33 percent of men and 35.3 percent of women.
<a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a> As John Gillis has pointed out, &#8216;The new cohabitation has many
of the features of the old betrothal. It was an extended rite of
transition &#8211; a liminal period &#8211; which was brought to a ritual
conclusion when the couple decided it was time to incorporate
themselves into the adult world of mothers and fathers&#8217;. <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>

<p>Talk about sex and sexuality also tends to be more open, and
sexual practices are more widespread and varied. There are marked
differences between the generations. Only 3 percent of women who
started having sex in the 1950s had ten or more lifetime partners,
while 10 percent of women starting intercourse in the 1970s claimed
this figure. <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a> While half a sample of 45 to 59 year olds in the
early 1990s cited &#8216;being in love&#8217; as a reason for first
intercourse, this reason declined through the age groups, to only
37.5 percent of women aged 16 to 24. <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a> Attitudes to oral sex point
to the changes which have taken place. A survey in the early 1990s
revealed that while 76.7 percent of 18 to 24 year olds had
experienced oral sex, this rose to 87.8 percent of 25 to 34 year olds
but fell to 61.8 percent of 45 to 59 year olds. In the age group 16
to 24, of those who had ever experienced vaginal intercourse, 85
percent had also experienced oral sex. In the US oral sex appears to
be increasing among virgins, with 25 percent of virgin boys and 15
percent of virgin girls having given or received oro-genital
stimulation. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a> It seems the vast majority of oral sexual acts are
reciprocal, rather than the blowjobs usually talked about in
Hollywood films. <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p>Those who want women&#8217;s equality can only welcome these
developments, but the manifestations of sexuality which are so
prevalent today cannot be said to add up to sexual liberation. Unlike
the women&#8217;s magazines of the 1950s, where sexual problems were
referred to cryptically on the problem page, those of today trumpet
advice on keeping your man happy, how to improve your sex life and so
on. The assumption is that most people are having an active sex life
most of the time, although this is very far from the case. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a> We
are sold particular images of sex and sexuality which conform to
certain stereotypes about men and women but which reinforce attitudes
which are unequal or reinforce oppressive relationships: images of
violence, of dominance and submission, of rape. The image of sex is
far from one of equality and openness. Sex in all of its
manifestations is seen as a commodity to be bought and sold on the
market. Pornographic films, videos, magazines, lapdancing clubs,
phone sex, lad magazines with semi-pornographic contents, male
strippers, entertainment for stag and hen nights, &#8216;cybersex&#8217;, sex
contact listings in magazines, expensive women&#8217;s underwear, sex
toys and upmarket ice cream are only some of the goods which have
made millions for mostly big business in the past 20 years. Their
profits have been made out of the greater sexual openness: &#8216;In 1996
Americans spent more than $8 billion on hard core videos, peep shows,
live sex acts, adult cable programming, sexual vices, computer porn
and sex magazines &#8211; an amount much larger than Hollywood&#8217;s
domestic box office receipts and larger than all the revenues
generated by rock and country music recordings.&#8217; <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a></p>

<p>Globalisation helps create and characterises the sex trade. Sex
tourism is a major part of the economy in a number of countries. In
Thailand &#8216;international tourist arrivals jumped from 2 million in
1981 to 4 million in 1988 to over 7 million in 1996. Two thirds of
tourists were unaccompanied men ... In 1997 the annual illegal income
generated by sex workers in Thailand was roughly $10 billion.&#8217; <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a>
Estimates of the number of prostitutes in Thailand vary from more
than 80,000, which is the government figure, to 200,000 or even 1 or
2 million. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a> In the Dominican Republic, popular with European male
&#8216;sex tourists&#8217;, of 50 women working as prostitutes who were
interviewed in a survey, all but two were single mothers pushed into
the work through poverty. <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a></p>

<p>The destruction of the old industries and family structures
worldwide has a major impact on these developments. Global inequality
means that Western men can buy prostitutes very cheaply and that the
women have to sell their bodies in order to survive. Governments
ignore their plight most of the time. Those who constantly encourage
the development of the free market, and who moralise at those who do
not accept these developments, conveniently ignore this consequence
of the market.</p>

<p>Freedom of sexuality should be a fundamental right, that people
can enjoy sexual relations regardless of economic or religious
constraint. Yet the increase in sexual freedom over recent decades,
which should be of benefit to the vast majority of men and women, has
brought buying and selling, the rule of the commodity, into what
should be the most personal and intimate relationships. The women and
men directly involved in the production and display of these
commodities are often degraded by this process, but so are the rest
of us, since sexuality is turned into a series of objects and
commercial relationships rather than being a natural expression of
human relations.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Housewives&#8217; choice</h4>

<p class="fst">Changing sex roles have led to talk of male crisis. Hollywood
films such as Falling Down or Disclosure paint the picture of a world
where the old masculine values no longer apply and where women take
cruel advantage over men at work. Men lose jobs to women, are
sexually harassed by women, feel discriminated against by women. This
makes them neurotic and ill (supposedly once the preserve of women).
In the US &#8216;movies featuring muscular men such as Russell Crowe and
Brad Pitt [are] giving males an inferiority complex&#8217;. As record
numbers of male subscribers to gyms were noted, US psychotherapist
Roberto Olivardia commented, &#8216;Men tie their self esteem to their
physical appearance, it&#8217;s a huge problem&#8217;. <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a> Men now are much
closer to women in their attitudes to physical appearance: they are
more likely to follow fashion, to buy personal toiletries and to
worry about their figure and looks. They are, however, more likely to
become seriously ill than women, on average die younger than women
and have a higher rate of suicide. In the ten years running up to the
early 1990s, male suicides in Britain increased by 80 percent,
notably among young men. <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a> Nothing seems to be going right for
men: increasingly they seem threatened by &#8216;career women&#8217;,
frightened by their own failings as men and with a terrible sense of
loss for the past golden age when men and women both knew their place.</p>

<p>Now men supposedly feel that they are superfluous to women and the
family and no longer have a breadwinner role. The question could not
even have arisen 30 or 40 years ago. Its starting point is the very
great changes to the family and women&#8217;s ability or desire to head a
household. Whereas only 7 percent of households with dependent
children were headed by lone mothers in 1971, by the late 1990s this
had risen to 22 percent. Lone fathers headed another 2 percent of
families. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a> These figures demonstrate a dramatic increase in the
number of women caring for children without the support of a man.
However, they also show that three quarters of children are still
brought up in two-parent families. In addition, the sense that men
have little or no role within the home hardly matches with their
increased participation in childcare and housework. Most fathers who
do not live with their children are not the &#8216;deadbeat dads&#8217; of
tabloid mythology. The majority are in contact with them: 70 percent
of non-resident fathers have some contact with their children and 50
percent see their children every week. <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a> So most children are
living with or in regular contact with their fathers &#8211; hardly the
basis for a mass crisis.</p>

<p>One feature of the change in men&#8217;s behaviour has been the
increase in male work around the home. This is a strongly contested
issue: different surveys show different results, and surveys of who
does housework are notoriously subjective. But there is general
agreement that as women have ceased to be full time housewives, they
have lessened the amount of work that they do in the home. As women
work full time, so the gap between the amount of housework that they
do and that of their male partners narrows. The number of hours
devoted by men to household chores stood at 17 minutes per day in
1961; by 1985 it stood at 40 minutes a day. <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a> During the same
period the time spent by British women on routine housework fell by
55 minutes a day or 6.5 hours per week. In the initial part of this
period the amount of housework done by men also fell, suggesting that
the domestic appliances made affordable by the long boom were having
some impact on curtailing hours spent in domestic labour. But that
changed from the 1970s, when the domestic work of all men went up
from 15 minutes to 40 minutes a day and that of full time employed
from 13 minutes a day to 35 minutes. This &#8216;probably therefore
reflects ideological changes as well as the practical pressures
associated with married women&#8217;s move into paid employment&#8217;. <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a>
While the total number of hours spent on housework has fallen for all
women it has not done so proportionately, with full time workers
gaining least and with those without employment benefiting most. <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, working parents of both sexes spend more time
devoted to childcare &#8211; especially to under-five childcare. Employed
men spent an average 44 minutes a day mainly on childcare in 1985
compared with 11 minutes in 1961 &#8211; far less than the 107 minutes
spent on the same childcare by women in 1985, but a substantial
increase nonetheless. <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a> Many men tell researchers that they would
like to play more of a role in their children&#8217;s lives than their
own fathers did during their childhood. <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a> However, the sexual
division of labour is still one which sees women doing the bulk of
domestic labour, despite the very great changes over the past few
decades. A study in the mid-1990s for a Time Use survey showed that
mothers spent much more time doing cooking and housework than men
(2.59 hours per day as opposed to 0.41 hours) and more time caring
for children and adults (1.56 hours against 0.54). Men on the other
hand did more paid work (5.31 hours per day compared with 2.06 hours
for women) and spent an hour a day on travel, compared with half an
hour for women. Women did, however, spend more time sleeping and
socialising. <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a> Recent statistics from the US give two examples of
how family life is changing. Parents of both sexes are spending an
average of ten or 12 hours less per week with their children than
they did in 1960, and McDonald&#8217;s is the source of 10 percent of
family meals. <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a> This suggests a family where everyone is under
pressure of time and where the classic model of the family has been
at the very least severely weakened in many respects.</p>

<p>The amount of work outside the home by either or both partners has
a decisive effect on the amount of domestic work carried out by
parents. The responses of young mothers and fathers, again in the
mid-1990s, to questions about the division of labour in the home bear
this out. Even when both partners worked full time, mothers took
responsibility for the majority of household chores, but here 27
percent of men said they shared preparing and cooking the meal, 40
percent shared shopping and 35 percent shared cleaning equally. When
the woman worked part time this fell to 15 percent, 28 percent and 16
percent. Where the wife was at home full time, only 10 percent shared
cooking the main meal and only 11 percent shared cleaning &#8211;
interestingly, the same number shared shopping as those with part
time worker wives. Mothers&#8217; responses to the same questions showed
some differences but not massive discrepancies. In general, women
were slightly more likely to answer that they did most of these
chores and slightly less likely to believe they were shared equally.
<a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a> The overwhelming conclusion is that where both work full time
they are most likely to share chores, but even then they are far from
being equally shared. The traditional division of labour still
applies, and men do most DIY and repairs. Even so, where the wife
works and the man stays at home, the man&#8217;s share increases,
although not sufficiently to reverse roles. This is also the area of
greatest discrepancy between men and women, so 28 percent of men
believe they do most cooking of the main meal, while only 6 percent
of wives think their husbands do this. <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a> Some commentators have
even suggested that men in full time work actually do more domestic
chores than unemployed men with working partners. <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a> It appears
that that there are much more complex issues at work than simply who
works longer hours outside the home. Where the sex roles are most
obviously reversed &#8211; where the woman works and the man stays at
home &#8211; there are often signs that the man has particular difficulty
fitting into the &#8216;housewife&#8217; role, while the woman both works
outside the home and has to shoulder a substantial domestic burden as
well. If this is the case, it suggests an ideological as well as a
practical reluctance by some men in the home to take on this role,
itself a product of the low esteem in which housework is held, which
in turn comes from the nature of housework as repetitive and unpaid
work inside capitalist society.</p>

<p>In a capitalist society the ability to sell one&#8217;s labour power
is the defining feature of each individual. Today the desire of
capital for this labour power is so great that every member of the
family is under pressure to enter the labour market. Anyone who is
unable to enter this market finds himself or herself at a
disadvantage. There are few opportunities for consumption of anything
but the basic necessities of life. Those without paid work carry some
of the lowest status in our society. Men who have been brought up to
expect paid work as their right feel it particularly acutely when it
is lost, and feel that being asked to fulfil a role which is widely
seen as socially subordinate is a denial of their role as men. It is
hardly surprising that those men who are forced from the labour
market feel disoriented and without social value. This after all was
how many housewives felt, and still do feel &#8211; but the men lack
their social conditioning to be able to cope, hence their inability
to even become &#8216;good housewives&#8217;. Unemployed men who are
responsible for childcare see themselves mostly as &#8216;failed
providers&#8217; rather than successful childcarers. <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a></p>

<p>Miners at Yorkshire&#8217;s Grimethorpe colliery, which shut in 1993,
describe the feelings of men in this situation. One says, &#8216;My day?
I get up and do the washing, hang it on the line, get the kids to
school, do some shopping, get the tea for when she gets home ... The
government talks about training, education. What for?&#8217; <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a> Another
says, &#8216;We had pride in our work, we made a contribution to the
world, we had a place, a proper purpose. Gone. Now I&#8217;m a
housewife.&#8217; <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a></p>

<p>One of the reasons many men&#8217;s attitudes are so contradictory is
because the signals sent to them by society are also contradictory.
Much of the dominant ideology in countries like Britain is
egalitarian in tone. Received opinion among the majority of our
rulers and the bulk of the media is that men and women are both
expected to work (indeed the stay at home mother who expects an
income from the state is now regarded with disapproval). Men and
women are expected to share housework and childcare where practically
possible and families are deemed to operate as contented units of
consumption where a degree of democratic choice is allowed to all its
members. Men who behave as authoritarian father figures are regarded
as both rare and wrongheaded. Tony Blair and David Beckham
demonstrate that caring comes naturally to fathers. No one could call
them Mary Annes &#8211; as they did men in Lancashire in the 1940s &#8211;
when they push the pram <a href="#n83" name="f83">[83]</a> (not that they do it very often since
that is the nanny&#8217;s job). But even while men are being encouraged
to show their emotions, there are much less pleasant developments
which also have an ideological effect on men&#8217;s attitudes to
themselves. Traditional male values have also reasserted themselves,
at least among a layer of men: lapdancing clubs, new lad magazines,
an insidious campaign against the notion of &#8216;date rape&#8217;, a
resurgence of sexist language, and continuing high levels of violence
against individual women.</p>

<p>The &#8216;New Lads&#8217; with their old attitudes about women were a
phenomenon described thus by Simon Nye, writer of the television
series <i>Men Behaving Badly</i>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Lad was created by the meritocracy (or new
plutocracy, depending on your political allegiance) unleashed by
Margaret Thatcher in 1979. The shouty young men that crowded London&#8217;s
trading markets and exchanges, earning fortunes and scaring away
cupboardsful of sniffy Guildford stockbrokers, were the Trojan Lads,
hidden in the bellies of financial institutions and wheeled inside
the walls of the establishment. And it was okay to swear and be a bit
of a sexist because they worked bloody hard. <a href="#n84" name="f84">[84]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The main expression of the &#8216;lads&#8217; has been the rise of the
men&#8217;s magazines &#8211; glossy and upmarket, filled with expensive
advertising, by the late 1990s they were selling 1.5 million copies a
month between them. <a href="#n85" name="f85">[85]</a> The titles range in sophistication and
presentation but there is no doubting their selling point: the covers
always have women in various states of undress. The inside is little
different, containing vast amounts about sex, a lot of football, and
a very strong interest in conspicuous consumption. There is a general
assumption that &#8216;foreigners&#8217; are inferior, being both strange and
stupid, that women really &#8216;want it&#8217; according to the most
stereotyped male fantasy, and that any real man will only be
interested in beer, sport and &#8216;shagging&#8217;. But these are
aspirational men behaving badly. The editor of <b>GQ Active</b>
described his average reader as between 25 and 35 and likely to be
&#8216;cruising down the motorway in an Audi with a mountain bike on the
roof&#8217;. <a href="#n86" name="f86">[86]</a> Advertising is aimed at twenty- and thirty-somethings
with large amounts of disposable income, focusing on cars, clothes
and army recruitment.</p>

<p>It is sometimes argued that the lad phenomenon and the men&#8217;s
magazines have a positive effect, that they are &#8216;an attempt by
straight men to come to terms with their new position in the world,
with the second wave of feminism and the undermin7ing of traditional
forms of gender identity&#8217;. <a href="#n87" name="f87">[87]</a> But any inspection of these
magazines shows little understanding of coming to terms with very
much. Features in <b>Loaded</b> include &#8216;Ten great arse moments in
movies&#8217; or David Baddiel&#8217;s views on wanking. In <b>FHM</b>, which
is supposed to be more sophisticated, international analysis is at
the boys&#8217; comic level. This is Benny Hill humour repackaged for the
1990s, and underlying it is a deeply conservative set of values. In
this they resemble the 1950s too. Women who complain about such
images, who don&#8217;t find the sexist jokes funny, or who in any other
way break from the norm, are regarded as humourless, too unattractive
to get a man, or lesbians. We love women, is the cry of the new lads,
but they don&#8217;t love women at all. The love a particular stylised
and objectified image of women because they believe this enhances
their masculinity and status:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In the case of lad mags there is not only nostalgia for
images of women in the mode of <b>Playboy</b> at its heyday, but also
the desire to utter all the offences known to man, freed from the
imagined tut-tutting of &#8216;ardent&#8217; feminists. Men&#8217;s magazines
celebrate images which three decades ago feminists would have
denounced without hesitation; but these contemporary images are set
in a context which attempts to deny us the right to have any opinion
at all. <a href="#n88" name="f88">[88]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The message of the magazines is that men can still celebrate their
domination in the face of the threat of liberation &#8211; and who can
dare to complain? Old sexist activities are dressed up as fun in
other areas as well. Sleazy old stripping is reborn as lapdancing in
expensive clubs patronised by businessmen and those on outings from
City banks. The presence of women in the audience is supposed to make
this cultural development acceptable. The 200 clubs which now exist
in Britain mark &#8216;the invention of a branch of the sex industry
considered not the slightest bit exploitative, nor remotely damaging
to women&#8217;. <a href="#n89" name="f89">[89]</a> The lapdancing clubs, however, do not break the
mould of the old exploitative strip joints or brothels &#8211; rather
they repackage it for credit card customers.</p>

<p>The alibi for much of this behaviour is the existence of women who
participate: the ladettes &#8211; hard-drinking, sexually aggressive,
confident women who are supposedly happy to go along with this
because they are playing men at their own game. The old sexism wanted
women to be passive &#8211; now they are allowed to be active as long as
they accept sexism. This wanting to be one of the boys attitude goes
much further than young women, with older women wanting to stress
their continuing sexual attractiveness and activity. The middle-aged,
middle class women who take their clothes off in <i>Calendar Girls</i>,
Germaine Greer&#8217;s writing on the boy as sex object and even the
advert for Marks and Spencer&#8217;s credit card where a woman eyes up
the Italian waiter all show how lacking in subversion and reinforcing
of sex roles this has become.</p>

<p>Part of the debate about men is about trying to shore up
traditional family values in the face of an increasing unwillingness
on the part of many people to live in the conventional nuclear
family. Melanie Phillips declares that the &#8216;so called &#8220;crisis of
masculinity&#8221;&#8217; is &#8216;invented by those who wish to claim that the
distinctive role of fathers is redundant&#8217;. <a href="#n90" name="f90">[90]</a> Her aim is
transparent &#8211; forcing men to work would solve many of the social
problems that confront those who run our society at present:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Male breadwinning ... is neither arbitrary or
anachronistic. It is important both to cement masculine identity and
to civilise aggressive male characteristics. That&#8217;s why
unemployment has played havoc with young boys&#8217; socialisation and
shattered their fathers&#8217; emotional and physical health. Employment
is an instrumental, goal-driven activity which permits men to serve
their families through competition. In that way it directs male
aggression into pro-social purposes. <a href="#n91" name="f91">[91]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Phillips view of men is the modern equivalent of those who in
the 1960s decried the absence of a war or national service into which
young men could be conscripted. Today those who are excluded from
work are accused of tending to turn to violence and &#8211; even worse &#8211;
allowing the state to take responsibility for their families. Men
have to know their place, and it is to work &#8211; the only means, in
her chilling phrase, of &#8216;civilising&#8217; them. If this authoritarian
picture of an orderly world where men are breadwinners and women
accept a traditional role as mothers and wives suggests that men have
a built-in tendency to violence and bad behaviour as men, it is by no
means unique. The sense that men can only be redeemed and civilised
by the family is quite widely held.</p>

<p>Sandy Ruxton puts forward an explanation of the link between
masculinity and criminality in the sex roles which men and women
adopt when they become adults. The contradiction between the male
child and the adult is greater than that between the female child and adult:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The dominant view of masculinity is that a man should be
tough, strong, aggressive, independent, rational, intelligent, and so
on. But the dominant image of children is that they are vulnerable,
weak, immature, passive and dependent. This creates a particular
contradiction for boys, which is heightened as adulthood gets nearer,
simply because, within the construction of childhood, being a man
cannot be achieved. <a href="#n92" name="f92">[92]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If this is true, then becoming a man means rejecting all the
traits most closely associated with childhood &#8211; and which all too
often are also associated with &#8216;femininity&#8217; &#8211; and adopting
behaviour and practices regarded as manly. Gangs, a degree of
criminal behaviour, fighting, and scorning certain forms of learning
which are seen as childish are all part of this process. So too is
the adulation of sporting heroes. There is a class element to this.
High-status schools tend to foster a liberalised version of the old
public school ethos: individual excellence in sport, but also a sense
of purpose in learning, given the expectation of all concerned in
these enterprises that their pupils will fulfil an important place in
society. The middle and upper classes place much store on individual
development, to a certain extent apart from the mass of people, and
an ambition to succeed in a career. Teenage boys from these sorts of
backgrounds will see themselves as preparing for such a future.
Working class boys take their adolescent development much more from
the streets and from popular culture: collective praise for
individual sporting or musical expertise is highly valued, and
practical and physical attributes attract a higher status than
academic ability. This is the sort of masculinity which is so
objected to by the commentators, yet in itself it represents a threat
not to the mass of people but to the dominant ideology which tries to
put working class kids in their place. Why should ability at
breakdancing not be valued as highly as playing golf? Or the ability
to memorise song lyrics as valuable as knowing multiplication tables?
The fashion for street clothes, the customisation of school uniforms,
the refusal to accept the narrow middle class ideology now imposed
with such a straitjacket on the schools, are a form of rebellion
which often stresses aggression as a means of asserting some sort of
control and status in life.</p>

<p>Even here we should hold on to some perspective. Most boys are not
extremely violent, or habitual criminals. Some of the most common
crimes may be more &#8216;feminine&#8217; than &#8216;masculine&#8217;. Home Office
figures confirm that an eighth of all recorded offences are for
shoplifting and that more women than men are cautioned for the crime.
It is especially common among young women, and 7,528 girls between
the age of 13 and 15 are cautioned each year. This compares with
6,370 boys. <a href="#n93" name="f93">[93]</a> One survey found that 89 percent of 16 year old
working class girls had been involved in at least one physical fight.
<a href="#n94" name="f94">[94]</a> It would be hard to deduce from recent furores around some of
these questions that juvenile crime was not pandemic. Nor would one
conclude that &#8211; as is the truth &#8211; more boys pass exams than in
the past and there is less illiteracy among the young than among the
old. It is true that in many areas of education girls do better than
boys, and that their improvement rate tends to be much faster than
boys. But this is hardly surprising given the transformation of
expectations about work and education for women over the past few
decades. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, when girls tended to do worse
in education than boys, this was put down to girls&#8217; low
expectations of a career and their internalisation of their
oppression. Today, especially when educational qualifications have
taken on such heightened importance in the labour market for workers
of both sexes, it is hardly surprising that girls attempt to equip
themselves for competition in that market alongside boys. It may be
as well that the preponderance of girls in clerical and white collar
jobs may encourage them slightly more than boys to gain
qualifications. This is very much a process of equalisation between
the sexes. In this process boys can feel that relatively they are
doing worse and feel a lack of self esteem due to this. However, the
fact remains that the position of boys in education is improving too,
but at a much slower rate. The proportion of young women in Britain
achieving two or more A-levels has doubled since the mid-1970s,
whereas the number of men doing so has risen by just under a half in
the same period. Even so, the number gaining A-levels has risen
substantially. <a href="#n95" name="f95">[95]</a> Whereas 173,000 women were full time
undergraduates in 1970/71, by 1997/98 there were 554,000. Comparable
figures for men were 241,000 and 498,000. Women have caught up and
overtaken men at this level, but among postgraduates they are still
slightly below the figures for men, although again they have started
from a lower level. <a href="#n96" name="f96">[96]</a> The big increase in women&#8217;s participation
and rise in qualifications seems to have stemmed from the 1980s,
perhaps the most decisive decade in marking the idea that women had
to take responsibility for their own self advancement, and this
advance has certainly continued into the 1990s. <a href="#n97" name="f97">[97]</a> Whether it will
continue &#8211; marking an ever widening gap between the sexes &#8211; or
whether it will stabilise with broad levels of equality but with
women at a slight advantage is too early to say. What is
indisputable, however, is the role of class in education and this
appears to have a much greater influence on performance than gender.
Pupils in comprehensive schools in the poorest urban areas achieve
half the success rate at GCSE of those in better-off urban areas.
<a href="#n98" name="f98">[98]</a> In 1991/92, 55 percent from families of professionals went into
higher education aged under 21; by 1998/99, 72 percent did. In
1991/92 only 6 percent of those from unskilled working class
backgrounds went into higher education. By the end of the decade this
had risen to 13 percent. Professionals were more than twice as likely
as the national average to see their children in higher education,
while unskilled workers were more than half as likely. <a href="#n99" name="f99">[99]</a> The sense
of worthlessness and bitterness at what the future holds must surely
be connected in the minds of working class girls and boys with this
lack of accessibility to the sort of education which at least holds
out a promise of financial and social benefits. For when we look at
those children who gain no qualifications, there is not a massive
discrepancy between boys and girls. So 8 percent of boys and 5
percent of girls gained no graded GCSEs in 1997/98, while 26 percent
of boys and 33 percent of girls gained two or more A-levels. <a href="#n100" name="f100">[100]</a>
Seeing the educational divide as a boy/girl question only obscures
the much greater division of class which the right wing commentators
are so keen to deny.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What sort of a society sees women as a threat?</h4>

<p class="fst">Now men know what it&#8217;s like to be a woman, is the common
response from many of those women who find themselves regaled with
stories of male crisis. Women can&#8217;t help thinking that we&#8217;ve
always had to put up with this &#8211; why is it different when it
happens to a man? Time and again, the experience of men who have lost
work or are doing lower grade work than they have been used to is
comparable to women&#8217;s traditional malaise at being in the home.
Bill Costas, an unemployed meatpacker in the US aged 34 moans, &#8216;I
don&#8217;t see anybody anymore. The guys I worked with were my buddies
... We&#8217;d go out after work and have a beer and shoot the bull. Now
I don&#8217;t even know what they&#8217;re doing anymore&#8217;. <a href="#n101" name="f101">[101]</a> Some
believe men&#8217;s problem is precisely that they are in the traditional
&#8216;female&#8217; role.</p>

<p>But of course they are not in the traditional female role. Men
still go out to work in very large numbers, they still hang on to
nearly all the really powerful jobs in capitalist society, and they
still leave women holding the baby most of the time, whether these
women do it for love or for a paid wage. Men are not full time
househusbands very often &#8211; and those who claim to be are often
working at home part time in an occupation which has a high degree of
autonomy and is relatively well rewarded. This is a very long way
from the low-status work, cut off from any society wider than
immediate neighbours and children, that makes women prone to
depression, boredom and nervous illness. Those men who most closely
approximate to such a role are the long term unemployed, usually
without direct childcare responsibilities, and often older men, who
sense their worthlessness from their inability to sell their labour power.</p>

<p>The real transformation here is that men and women are moving
closer together in terms of their work and their domestic life, but
they are struggling to do so in conditions not of their own choosing.
They do so against a background of continuing women&#8217;s oppression
and intensified exploitation for both men and women. No wonder so
many feel in crisis. No wonder either that increasing numbers are
beginning to question a society which treats men and women in this
way. The experience of capitalist society is a potential unifier of
working class people: the very process of exploitation brings large
numbers of people together as workers. They face similar experiences
of low wages, petty rules at work, the tyranny of time-keeping, and
being constantly tied to machinery. They perceive a common enemy in
the form of the employer. But there are other factors at work: most
importantly, capitalist society also acts to divide working class
people. This is done in a thousand small and large ways, and through
a combination of ideological and material factors. Women&#8217;s material
disadvantage in terms of wages, for example, is underpinned by the
view of women as primarily mothers or sex objects which still
prevails. Racist and nationalist arguments feed on the fact that in
capitalist society there is scarcity amid plenty and that workers
have to compete for scarce resources. So competition between workers
for jobs or housing or education can act to reinforce racist ideas.
Society tries to pit men against women, blacks against whites,
Catholics against Protestants. When an oppressed group gain anything
at the expense of those they are supposed to be competing with, this
is enough to cause a crisis. Instead of seeing the real source of
problems lying in the wider social system which exploits and
oppresses, working people all too often see the problem as lying
within the immediate division of these scarce resources.</p>

<p>Women have not benefited at the expense of men. They still work in
the home and in paid work. Both sexes are under increased pressure,
with the lives of working men and women unrecognisable compared with
one or two generations ago. Both now have to work to provide an
adequate family income; both are pressurised to ensure that their
children gain the education and qualifications to equip them for the
labour market as it is today; both struggle to fit the tasks of
childcare and housework into their busy lives. As the family becomes
a centre of enhanced consumption, so individual men and women are
sold an image of themselves which goes well beyond the old roles of
breadwinner and homemaker. They are meant to successfully transcend
these old roles and adopt at least some of the roles seen as the
property of the other sex. Fitting into these new roles may be more
rewarding or enjoyable in some cases, but it is usually hard work. So
women work for less than equal wages while men are expected to
participate in unpaid childcare.</p>

<p>The discomfort which men feel at the new situation in which they
find themselves demonstrates how artificial the old situation was. In
<b>The Condition of the Working Class</b> in England Frederick Engels
wrote of the unease felt among men as they lost their work in
textiles and saw their wives or daughters earning more money than
they could. He described the plight of a male worker in St Helens,
Lancashire, interrupted by a friend while darning his wife&#8217;s
stockings. The worker describes how he has had no work for three
years, while his wife works from dawn till night in the factory and
so is too tired to do anything at home. <a href="#n102" name="f102">[102]</a> Engels wrote of how
insane this system was and how degrading it was to both sexes, since
it &#8216;unsexes the man and takes from the woman all womanliness
without being able to bestow upon the man true womanliness or the
woman true manliness&#8217;. <a href="#n103" name="f103">[103]</a> There is nothing natural about gender
roles or about the attitudes and status which are attributed to them.
Instead, he says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">... so total a reversal of the position of the sexes can
have come to pass only because the sexes have been placed in a false
position from the beginning. If the reign of the wife over the
husband, as inevitably brought about by the factory system, is
inhuman, the pristine rule of the husband over the wife must have
been inhuman too. <a href="#n104" name="f104">[104]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In an unequal society, there must always be someone on top &#8211; but
there is nothing natural or fair about this. This is the basis of
Engels&#8217; argument, developed elsewhere, that the family and gender
roles within it are artificial constructions. <a href="#n105" name="f105">[105]</a> The male crisis
is a product of a society incapable of treating its members as equal
human beings, but which instead robs them of any control of their
lives. The response to this among men in particular is twofold. Men
often cling on to a sense of identity or pride in masculine values or
traits, which they think set them apart from women (or indeed from
men who are regarded as being &#8216;feminine&#8217;). But at the same time
they feel a sense of unease and of powerlessness in controlling what
happens in their world. This explains much of the seemingly
contradictory behaviour of men today and also points to a possibly
frightening but potentially exhilarating future, as an understanding
of the shallowness and inequity of the old relationships leads to a
wider questioning of how the world is run.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The problem of feminism</h4>

<p class="fst">What has happened to women&#8217;s liberation? By the late 1970s the
movement which had such an impact ideologically in putting the issue
of women on the political agenda was deeply divided. The activism
that marked many of its adherents declined dramatically; the women&#8217;s
movement had never been a mass movement in Britain, but now it
fragmented into different and disparate campaigns. Although the
movement&#8217;s founders tended to be socialists and trade unionists,
the second half of the 1970s saw the growth of radical feminism. The
disputatious conference in 1978 marked the last time that the
movement ever met as a movement. The subsequent decades have been
ones of retreat for most feminists as the attempts to find niches
where they could practise their feminism took them into different
directions. Many saw the Labour Party and especially local Labour
councils as a key agent of change, enthused by the chance of setting
up women&#8217;s committees and creating reforms for women as part of a
reborn local government. The attacks by Thatcher on the GLC and other
local councils put paid to such good intentions and little was
salvaged from what remained apart from a number of individual women
who went on to become MPs or councillors. Other women went into
academia, teaching women&#8217;s studies courses and related topics.
<a href="#n106" name="f106">[106]</a> In the course of the 1980s and 1990s, as feminism became more
acceptable as an ideology, so it became more limited in terms of what
it would accept. Abandonment of collective change leads to an
exclusive emphasis on individual change and with that powerlessness
in confronting the structures of oppression. Instead of defining
itself in solidarity with wider movements and with the working class
struggle it was enough simply to think in a feminist way in order to
be involved in political practice. This took its toll not just on the
activism of the movement but on its ideas, especially as the right
wing ideas of Thatcherism and then of neo-liberalism post-1989 gained
influence. Some of the ideas which had been accepted in the 1960s and
1970s now came under attack: a generation of younger feminists sang
the praises of make-up and designer clothes, or dismissed the idea of
date rape as wildly exaggerated. In <b>The Morning After</b> Katie
Roiphe writes, &#8216;If I was really standing in the middle of an
epidemic, a crisis, if 25 percent of my female friends were really
being raped, wouldn&#8217;t I know it?&#8217; Probably not, if in real life
she is as unsympathetic to the problem as her book suggests, someone
who believes that &#8216;someone&#8217;s rape may be another person&#8217;s bad
night&#8217;. <a href="#n107" name="f107">[107]</a> Another US feminist, Naomi Wolf, embraces the
entrepreneurial spirit of the age with her attacks on &#8216;victim
feminism&#8217; and the belief that &#8216;women&#8217;s businesses can be the
power cells of the 21st century&#8217;. <a href="#n108" name="f108">[108]</a> Wolf sees Princess Diana as
someone to be admired for having transformed herself from being a
victim. <a href="#n109" name="f109">[109]</a> British feminist Beatrix Campbell saw the pampered
princess as the subject for a whole book, including the ludicrous
claim that, &#8216;By telling her story, Diana joined the &#8220;constituency
of the rejected&#8221; &#8211; the survivors of harm and horror, from the
Holocaust, from world wars and pogroms, from Vietnam and the civil
wars of South America and South Africa, from torture and child abuse
&#8211; who have transformed the work of storytelling in our century&#8217;.
<a href="#n110" name="f110">[110]</a> Feminism appeared either disconnected from the world or
desperately looking for role models to whom women could aspire &#8211;
even if the role models turned out to be princesses.</p>

<p>Ideas of liberation do not stand in isolation from the wider
society. Some of them can become incorporated or accepted within
society &#8211; witness the very limited inclusion of a minority of women
and an even smaller minority of blacks into the high echelons of
power. Others adapt and bend to the dominant ideas, even where they
are not totally abandoned. This happened to a layer of feminists who
disconnected their individual progress from the wider progress of
society. While working women in most parts of the world saw their
conditions worsen, those who benefited from the changes left them
behind or even blamed them for their own failure to change and to
take advantage of the market opportunities which availed them.
Identity politics projected a view which could only be about
individual women &#8216;getting on&#8217; and therefore encouraging other
women. But the narrow scope of the vision led to myopia: identity
politics could only see its proponents&#8217; own advances or otherwise.
In a period when globalisation, imperialism and neo-liberalism have
run riot, concern about individual women or blacks &#8216;making it&#8217;
has, as Naomi Klein so well puts it, &#8216;amounted to a rearranging of
the furniture while the house burnt down&#8217;. <a href="#n111" name="f111">[111]</a> Fighting over the
shrinking resources available to women and blacks in the 1990s meant
&#8216;fighting their battles over a single, shrinking piece of pie &#8211;
and consistently failing to ask what was happening to the rest of
it&#8217;. <a href="#n112" name="f112">[112]</a></p>

<p>Today there is barely any pretence from some erstwhile feminists
that anything needs to be changed. A progression of spokeswomen for
the successful minority now tell us that feminism is backward-looking
or that women can only achieve by competing on the same terms as men.
<a href="#n113" name="f113">[113]</a> The retreat even further into postfeminism has led to an
abandonment of any attempt to make sense of women&#8217;s oppression, but
rather has become a simple reflection of one of society&#8217;s dominant
images &#8211; that women can make it if they work hard and don&#8217;t cause
any trouble. Elaine Showalter, veteran US feminist, now criticises
the &#8216;dead-end feminist combination of dependence on the nanny state
and lack of enterprise in politics and popular culture&#8217; and urges
us to &#8216;solve the childcare problem, and also make money&#8217;. She
asks, &#8216;Where are the female Richard Bransons and Jamie Olivers of
the nappy and naptime brigade?&#8217; <a href="#n114" name="f114">[114]</a> Where indeed?</p>

<p>The cleavage within the ideas of women&#8217;s liberation runs along
lines of class. Those who see liberation in terms of individual
advance can only do so by ignoring the millions of women and men for
whom life choices are quite different from which brand to buy, which
car to drive, or how to achieve the best &#8216;work-life balance&#8217;.
Throughout the world, the conditions of these people have
deteriorated while a small number have gained. Feminism has run up
against the limits of class society: the existence of a small
minority of women with access to top jobs and all the material
advantages that these bring with them is perfectly compatible with
the continued existence of class exploitation; millions of women
achieving real change in the form of equal pay or socialised
childcare is not. For the capitalist class to grant such demands
would mean cutting deep into their profits, something they are
unlikely to do without being forced to. And as the struggle revives,
globally and in Britain, as it has over the past few years, questions
of class become more relevant.</p>

<p>A growing number of women depend on other women to do their
domestic labour. In the US between 14 and 18 percent of households
employ an outsider to do their cleaning. Socialist feminist Barbara
Ehrenreich says, &#8216;Among my middle class, professional women friends
and acquaintances, including some who made important contributions to
the early feminist analysis of housework two and a half decades ago,
the employment of a cleaning person is now nearly universal&#8217;. <a href="#n115" name="f115">[115]</a>
But the question of class isn&#8217;t simply about individual attitudes,
shocking though some of these are &#8211; it is about the organisation of
the whole of society.</p>

<p>The women&#8217;s movement has failed because its theory was and is
incapable of addressing the very big problems now facing women and
the increasing class nature of the attacks on them. The theory of
patriarchy, which locates women&#8217;s oppression outside of capitalist
social relations and tries to separate out oppression and class,
proved inadequate to explain the real position of women. It could
only explain women&#8217;s oppression in terms of the benefits which
accrued to men and to capital as a result of that oppression.
Patriarchy could not therefore begin to explain the changes in
women&#8217;s lives which have been the themes of this article. Women
went out to work because capital needed labour reserves during its
long boom which could not be met by the existing male-dominated
workforce. Women&#8217;s entry into work coincided with large-scale
immigration for the same reason. The wages of men and women needed to
cover the higher costs of reproduction of the family, including the
costs of childcare. The monogamous, lifelong marriage and the
Kellogg&#8217;s cornflake advert traditional family no longer fitted this
situation. Sexual attitudes changed as a result of all these other
changes, as women saw themselves as less and less subservient.</p>
<p>Capitalism has served to break down many of the oppressive
structures which had dominated for hundreds if not thousands of
years, but it could not create liberation because it acts to turn
everything into a commodity and so even the caring functions of the
family are increasingly bought and sold on the market. And it
recreates oppression and its structures in order to divide the
working class. The central arena of women&#8217;s oppression remains the
family, which is both broken down by the effects of capitalism and
also maintained and reinforced by capital as the cheapest, most
convenient and most socially stable way of caring for the existing
generation of workers and reproducing the next generation. <a href="#n116" name="f116">[116]</a><br/>

<h4>Liberation now?</h4>

<p class="fst">What does liberation mean for a young woman in Thailand, facing
the choice between hard factory work and prostitution under the
control of pimps who exploit young girls for a few years until they
lose their health or looks? What does liberation mean for a working
mother in the north east of England who works in a call centre, who
rarely sees her partner because they both work shifts, and who
struggles to make ends meet on two miserable wages? What does
liberation mean for the Hispanic cleaner in Los Angeles, threatened
with deportation as an illegal immigrant and forced to neglect her
own home to clean other people&#8217;s?</p>

<p>It is obvious that political equality is not enough. Equality on
the same basis as men is fine if the man you are comparing yourself
to has an above-average income, can afford to pay for high quality
personal services, and has more than adequate living space and a
fulfilling high status job. If on the other hand he is low paid,
works in a monotonous and highly supervised job, works unsocial hours
and can only afford the cheapest housing, then the aspiration has to
be for something more. The call then has to be for economic and
social change, which means challenging the way capitalist society is
organised. For many feminists this is not a necessity: positive
discrimination at work, women-only shortlists for parliamentary
elections, women managers and academics at the highest level, are
sufficient to fulfil their aspirations. They do not even find these
battles particularly easy, as we have seen from the pitifully small
number of women MPs, or the regularly occurring industrial tribunals
about sexual harassment of female high-fliers in the City of London.
Institutions which defend privilege in general are unlikely to open
up even to the most respectable or compliant women. But these
feminists have little concern with these wider battles. Those who
want to change the world for working class women have to look to more
radical solutions.</p>

<p>The problem of childcare being privatised and remaining a burden
for women cannot be solved unless we have at hand the resources of
the whole of society to do so. That means the wealth that we create
going not into the pockets of the already rich and powerful, but into
developing a whole range of options for childcare including nurseries
on every street or estate available free to all those who want to use
them. A national childcare service based on the principles of the NHS
would be a huge step forward, but no capitalist class in the world
will let providing one eat into its profits when they can fall back
on the family to do the work unpaid. The 35&#8211;hour week for men and
women would be a huge step forward, cutting into unemployment, giving
people much more leisure time and allowing them to spend more time
with their children. This in turn would mean people needing less of
the paid services which accompany the long hours we work: the
cleaners, the grocery delivery vans, the childminders. Decent, cheap
social housing would mean less travel and commuting to work as people
were able to afford to live close to work. All of these provisions
would benefit most women and men, as well as the wider society, but
they will not be realised while those who control our world continue
to do so, because they would cut into the profits of our rulers.</p>

<p>Liberation will only be achieved when the working people of the
world take control of it, ending the exploitation which dominates our
lives and destroys our human potential and relations. Revolution is
about liberation and about taking control: control of the workplaces
and the work process so that we produce for need, not profit; control
of our own lives as we grapple with the possibilities of changing the
world. For women that control is central because it also means sexual
control in the genuine sense, rather than in the caricatured way of
mimicking men it means today. Sexual control means the right to have
children or not, as a woman chooses. This should seem a basic right
in the 21st century, but there are women who are forced to have
children they do not want because they are denied abortion or
contraception. There are other women who are forced not to have
children, injected with contraceptives such as Depo Provera. There
should be no financial, political or moral pressure on these
decisions. Women and men should have the right to divorce when either
partner wants it. Women should be free from domestic violence and
workplace sexual harassment. Only when we end an exploitative class
society which maintains oppression at its centre can we take control
and achieve these aims collectively.</p>

<p>The examples of even short-lived socialist societies in history
demonstrate that women&#8217;s demands came to the fore and that women
themselves fought to achieve them. Post-1917 Russia, despite being
poor, wartorn and beleaguered by invasion, achieved real changes for
women in what had been one of the most oppressive societies in the
world, changes only finally defeated with the rise of Stalinism.
Women&#8217;s liberation has to be part of the fight for socialism, of
the overthrow of class society, for it to achieve any of its
fundamental aims. If it is to be successful that struggle has to
involve working class men, not separate from them.</p>

<p>Divisions about fighting for liberation are not new. Early in the
last century there were arguments between the middle class feminists
and working class socialists about whether women&#8217;s liberation could
be achieved within capitalism. As the US socialist Elizabeth Gurley
Flynn said in 1915, following a major strike wave involving women
workers, &#8216;The sisterhood of women, like the brotherhood of man, is
a hollow sham to labour. Behind all its smug hypocrisy and sickly
sentimentality loom the sinister outlines of the class war&#8217;. <a href="#n117" name="f117">[117]</a>
The divisions which emerged internationally on class lines then have
emerged again now. This article has been mainly concerned with women
in Britain but features of their conditions are reproduced across the
world as globalisation, imperialism and neo-liberalism make their
attacks on working people. If in fighting back against them we make
the connection between women&#8217;s liberation, socialism and the
overthrow of class society then we will have brought the possibility
of change much closer.</p>
