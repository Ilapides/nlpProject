<p class="fst"><strong>Labourism and the English Genius</strong><br/>
Gregory Elliott<br/>
<em>Verso &#163;11.99</em></p>

<p class="fst">The sorry state of Labour&#8217;s current ideas make you want to
scream. The desperate rush to trail Tory policies and to praise the
market seems never ending. Just as right wingers fall out over
whether to tax or cut spending, Gordon Brown declares his undying
opposition to raising taxes. Ann Taylor has joined the Tory attack on
student grants by claiming that they are a handout to the middle
classes. David Blunkett describes supporting single mothers as
&#8216;defending the indefensible&#8217;.</p>

<p>But we cannot explain this by looking at the politics or
personalities of these individuals. As Gregory Elliott&#8217;s new book
demonstrates, this is a phase they are going through. Unfortunately
it doesn&#8217;t seem that Labour is going to grow out of it.</p>

<p>There have been, says Elliott, three phases in this century which
have marked not just Labour in Britain but all the Socialist and
Labour Parties internationally: &#8216;the adoption of a reformist
strategy for socialism (up to 1945); the retraction of socialism in
favour of regulated welfare capitalism (1945&#8211;75); the abandonment
or attenuation of the latter in the 1970s and 1980s.&#8217;</p>

<p>At every stage of its development, Labour was marked by a
commitment to preserving the British state, maintaining a
parliamentary monarchy and, well into the postwar period, hanging on
to many of the remnants of the British Empire.</p>

<p>Its reforms, most notably those of the 1945 government, were
designed not to challenge the rule of capital, but to make it more
efficient while ameliorating some of its worst excesses.
Nationalisation was restricted to those industries such as railways
and mines which attracted little private investment and needed
massive injections of state funding to make them profitable. The
health service was set up while making big concessions to doctors and
consultants about their autonomy.</p>

<p>It was a Labour government which introduced the most savage cuts
ever, in 1976, at the behest of the international Monetary Fund.
Since then, Labour&#8217;s successive electoral failures have been
matched by successive abandonment of its commitment to welfare and equality.</p>

<p>Elliott describes all this well. He is also highly critical of
attempts to turn Labour leftwards in the early 1980s around the
campaign for constitutional reform and Benn for deputy. &#8216;For all
the heady talk of a &#8220;new model Labour Party&#8221; foreshadowing a
&#8220;mass socialist party&#8221;, the rather more humdrum reality was a
hollow shell occupied by the &#8220;rank and file democracy&#8221; of
some 50,000 or fewer activists&#8217;. The Bennites as much as the right
wing relied on the &#8216;dead souls&#8217; of the trade union block vote to
win victory.</p>

<p>But his real scorn is reserved for the ever rightward moving
leadership under Neil Kinnock, seeking to occupy the middle ground
which &#8216;was forever shifting, under its feet, further rightwards &#8211;
dragging the party along in its train, and therewith onto hostile
territory, where its hasty and ill-organised manoeuvres proved no
match for an enemy deploying on home ground and encouraged, by
Labour&#8217;s retreat towards it, to extract further concessions.&#8217;</p>

<p>Much of Elliott&#8217;s analysis would be shared by many readers of
this <strong>Review</strong>. However there is a weakness at the core of his
argument which prevents him from drawing any useful conclusions. He
believes that British society is an archaic system dominated by
commercial and financial capital, in which manufacturing capital has
long been subservient.</p>

<p>Calls for socialism are, he says, impractical and should be
replaced instead by a series of constitutional changes which would
allow a proper democracy to flourish. This would presumably be a
stage towards some form of democratic socialism.</p>

<p>It is, however, a utopian project. Despite differences of interest
between sections of the capitalist class, their class unity is much
greater than anything which divides them.</p>

<p>Any substantial constitutional reforms &#8211; especially the
abolition of the monarchy and the House of Lords &#8211; would be opposed
by the vested interests of the rich and powerful represented within
that capitalist class. Such reforms could not be implemented without
taking on aspects of class struggle aimed at overthrowing the whole system.</p>

<p>Elliott roots Labour&#8217;s failing in its appeal to a mythical and
imperialist &#8216;nation&#8217; rather than class. What a pity that he too
falls into the trap of believing that somehow reforming the
constitution can begin to overcome the contradictions of British capitalism.</p>
