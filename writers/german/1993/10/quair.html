<p class="fst"><strong>A Scots Quair</strong><br/>
by Lewis Grassic Gibbon<br/>
Adapted by Alastair Cording</p>

<p class="fst">The Glasgow based TAG theatre company has brought Grassic Gibbon&#8217;s
trilogy of books to life.</p>

<p><strong>Sunset Song</strong>, <strong>Cloud Howe</strong> and <strong>Grey Granite</strong> &#8211;
collectively known as <strong>A Scots Quair</strong> &#8211; are the story of a
dying culture and the birth of a new one. Through the eyes of the
heroine, Chris Guthrie, we see the destruction of the old Scottish
peasantry accelerated by the First World War, and the encroachment of
a brutal system of exploitation which leads to the open class warfare
of the 1920s and 1930s.</p>

<p>This staging is one of the most exciting and political of recent
years, bringing to mind some of the best agitprop theatre of the
1960s and 1970s.</p>

<p>The closed and narrow community of Kinraddie is centred on a land
which has remained unchanged for generations, but which finds the
outside world encroaching on it dramatically. In <strong>Sunset Song</strong>
young men go off to the war, some &#8211; like Chris&#8217;s young husband
Ewan &#8211; never to return. The landscape itself is destroyed when the
trees are felled for the war industry.</p>

<p>The upheavals and class polarisation of the interwar years are
central to Chris&#8217;s story. She marries an idealistic Church of
Scotland minister, whose aim is to eliminate poverty in the mill town
of Segget where he preaches. The failure of Labour Party reforms, the
betrayal of the 1926 General Strike and the bitter fruits of that
betrayal for workers in the late 1920s are all shown as contributing
to Robert Colquohoun&#8217;s despair.</p>

<p>When a rat kills the baby of an evicted couple, he is stirred to
protest at the failure of the churches and the need for revolution,
but dies after giving his sermon.</p>

<p>In <strong>Grey Granite</strong> Chris and her now grown up son Ewan move to
the city, where Chris struggles to run a boarding house and Ewan
leads a strike in the steelworks, is beaten by the police and becomes
a Communist. The trilogy ends with Ewan leading a hunger march to
London and Chris returning to her original ruined home to end her life.</p>

<p>But the bare bones of the plot in no way do justice either to the
books or to the plays. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the
books is their use of language. Grassic Gibbon uses the Scots dialect
to convey his image of a community in the Howe of the Mearns, in the
east of Scotland. At first, many of the words are incomprehensible
(at least to an English reader), but Grassic Gibbon in a preface asks
the reader to bear with him, and to imagine a situation if the Dutch
language disappeared and the writer had to write about Dutch life in
German. He would include all sorts of words and dialect which are
incomprehensible to a German speaker, but the meaning would become clear.</p>

<p>So it is with <strong>Sunset Song</strong>. And as Chris&#8217;s story
progresses and she leaves her childhood home, the language becomes
more anglicised. By the time we reach the city in <strong>Grey Granite</strong>,
much of the dialect has disappeared under the impact of the radio,
cinema and other mass media. In place of the lyrical feel to the
language of the earlier books, there is a feeling of brittleness and
shattering, as the stable world collapses and Chris and Ewan&#8217;s
lives diverge.</p>

<p>A theatre production which reproduced these stories literally
could have produced a nostalgic chunk of Scottish heritage.</p>
<p>But this production is as political as you could wish for. It has
opponents of the war imprisoned as conscientious objectors, marchers
singing the <em>Red Flag</em> and the <em>Internationale</em>, strikers
fighting with scabs and police.</p>

<p>More than that, it conveys &#8211; through music, imaginative staging
and very good acting &#8211; people grappling with a changing world and
new ideas, and, in the case of Chris, with the oppression of being a
woman: domestic drudgery, sexual pressure from her father, the pain
of childbirth, her loveless final marriage.</p>

<p>Yet Chris is also portrayed as a woman with strong sexual feelings
and social independence.</p>

<p>Perhaps best about these plays is their sense of political
commitment. Obviously the novels lose something in being staged, but,
as Gibbon&#8217;s daughter has said, &#8216;a much more significant loss
threatens the <strong>Quair</strong> as its revolutionary spark is snuffed out
beneath the weight of academia, school syllabuses, the heritage
industry.&#8217;</p>

<p>The plays are in the tradition of Gibbon himself &#8211; subversive
and revolutionary. Whether you have read the books or not, try to see
them. They are a thrilling theatrical experience.</p>
