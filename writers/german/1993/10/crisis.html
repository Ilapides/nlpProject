<p class="fst">Wherever you look in Britain today, the air of crisis, decay and
despair is greater than it has been for many years.</p>

<p>Contempt for mainstream politicians (a recent poll showed over 90
percent of people distrust them), erosion of support for institutions
such as the police or monarchy, and the feeling that every area of
British life is in decline have never been greater.</p>

<p>When nearly 1,500 people voted for the fascist British National
Party in Millwall last month, giving them their first local
councillor, the grim reality of the crisis of British politics hit
home. The decay, the closure of industry, the rundown of public
services, the feeling of paralysis about any political change, have
become the dominant features in a society where only five years ago
we were being told we had escaped economic crisis forever.</p>

<p>The magic of the market, the trickle down of wealth from the rich
to the poor, the enterprise culture, have been exposed as a sham.
Nowhere in Britain is this more the case than in the Isle of Dogs,
site of the BNP victory, where the grotesque monolith of Canary Wharf
stands as a monument to the values which are so detested by most
people today.</p>

<p>All the evidence suggests that institutions which have
traditionally been central to holding British society together and
winning the adherence of the majority of the population &#8211; including
a sizeable chunk of the working class &#8211; have been dramatically
weakened in recent years. Even the police themselves now declare that
they have no confidence in the criminal justice system. What hope can
there be for the rest of us?</p>

<p>At the centre of so much of the contempt and unpopularity are the
politicians from the main parties themselves. The Tories are of
course the main recipients of this feeling. Partly, they have fallen
out among themselves. John Major has, after all, been quoted by the
press in recent months referring to other cabinet ministers as
&#8216;bastards&#8217; and Tory backbench critics as &#8216;barmy&#8217;.</p>

<p>Local Tory activists are at their most demoralised for years. For
example, the membership officer for the Western region, Dr Adrian
Rogers, said on John Major&#8217;s recent visit to his area:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;I wanted to know if he really appreciated how hard it
was being a Conservative and I think he did. It&#8217;s a very loyal
party but it&#8217;s had the worst year ever and I think that&#8217;s got
through to him.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Another loyal activist, the leader of the Tory opposition on
Taunton Deane council, John Meikle, said: &#8216;People are concerned
about a number of things, including VAT on fuel and a whole lot of
unpopular issues. I feel that probably the party has unnecessarily
inflicted on people things to grumble about&#8217;.</p>

<p>But rows between Tory politicians are only one sign of more
widespread contempt. There is a <em>universal</em> feeling that
politicians are all liars.</p>

<p>And the ideological crisis goes much deeper than merely
superficial discontent with politicians. It has its roots in the
complete failure of Thatcherism to deliver what was required for the
British ruling class.</p>

<p>A recent opinion poll shows that 46 percent of people, including
24 percent of Tory voters, agree that &#8216;more socialist planning
would be the best way to solve Britain&#8217;s economic problems&#8217;. This
demonstrates how far the mood has swung against the &#8216;free market&#8217;
and its supposed benefits.</p>

<p>Recent surveys on taxation show a similar change in attitudes.
Fifty nine percent were in favour, in a recent ICM poll for the
<strong>Guardian</strong>, of raising the higher rate of tax. Only 14 percent
were in favour of higher VAT. In response to the question of what
public spending should be cut if it is necessary, 93 percent and 90
percent were against cutting health and education spending
respectively. The only area where there was a clear majority for
spending cuts was in defence, where 64 percent favoured cuts.</p>

<p>The imposition of VAT on fuel has led to further erosions in its
already low popularity. Privatisation of rail, the closure of more
and more mines despite popular opposition, the drying up of funds for
NHS hospitals, have combined with uncertainty about jobs and low
wages to increase the level of bitterness.</p>

<p>However; contempt for Tory politics also spreads to the other
parties. Despite some success by the Liberal Democrats in winning
disaffected Tory voters in rural constituencies, their policies are
unlikely to provide any alternative to Tory cuts or unemployment, and
they are now quite correctly tarred with the brush of right wing
populism and racism, a tactic they have employed for years far wider
than just in Tower Hamlets.</p>

<p>Labour is increasingly seen as the main alternative by the
majority of working class people, with its poll ratings suggesting a
majority government if there were an election. But there is little
enthusiasm for &#8211; and much disillusion with &#8211; Labour.</p>

<p>There are two main reasons for this. One is the total failure of
Labour to address the problems facing ordinary working people. On
taxation, on social security, on education, it trails after the
Tories, wanting to ameliorate the worst of their excesses, but
accepting the ground on which they stand. Labour, backed up by its
allies, the trade union leaders, has opposed or downplayed any idea
of direct action by people themselves to prevent attacks.</p>

<p>The second reason for Labour&#8217;s unpopularity is its own record in
local government. Acceptance of government cuts, a refusal to fight
for better provision, the erosion of council services and a tendency
to do deals with businessmen and property developers at the expense
of local people have increased. Disillusion with Labour is at its
greatest on many of the declining council estates, with their
non-existent services, which are often little better than prisons for
many of their residents.</p>

<p>Attacks on council workforces through the cuts and areas such as
competitive tendering have eroded much of the Labour councils&#8217;
traditional support.</p>

<p>So any positive endorsement of Labour almost always now hangs on
what they would <em>not</em> do &#8211; they would <em>not</em> privatise
rail, cut public spending as far as the Tories have or extend VAT.
This lack of support and identification does not mean that Labour
cannot grow or cannot win elections.</p>

<p>But it does mean that a polarisation has developed. The old
consensus politics, which was the bedrock of postwar society, has
disappeared. In its place have appeared apathy and cynicism,
punctuated by huge explosions of anger, such as over the poll tax or
the miners. The economic crisis has greatly increased this mood,
which is why the fascists were able to win their vote in Millwall.
But disillusion with the system also gives a new audience for
socialist ideas as an alternative to the dead end of parliamentary politics.</p>

<p>The polarisation in politics, the vacuum created by Labour&#8217;s
decline and the inertia of the unions, and the terrible effects of
the crisis on ordinary working people, all combine to create an
atmosphere in which the fascists can gain some support. Why is this,
when the BNP represents race hatred, forced deportation of
immigrants, destruction of any form of democracy, the smashing of
trade unions and democratic political parties and the silencing of
any voice of protest?</p>

<p>Their appeal is not, of course, based on propagating these views.
If they were to campaign on such a platform their support would never
get any bigger than the tiny number of boneheads and fanatics who
comprise their inner core. That is why it is so important for them to
gain respectability &#8211; something the fascists have been so far
unable to do &#8211; and why they base their campaigning on identifying
with some of the key areas of discontent which so worry working class
people today.</p>

<p>The Isle of Dogs was fertile ground in this respect. The contrast
between wealth and poverty is vast and dramatic. Promises of jobs and
houses for local people with docklands redevelopment have not
materialised. There is a justifiable feeling that these people have
been left to rot by national government and by the local council as
well &#8211; both Liberal and Labour.</p>

<p>The BNP has a completely false yet superficially plausible
argument: the neglect of local people and the lack of concern by big
business mean that Asians and other &#8216;foreigners&#8217; are taking the
houses, jobs and schools which should by rights go to locals &#8211; i.e.
whites. This argument alone would perhaps not be persuasive &#8211; after
all, it has had little resonance in many other equally deprived parts
of the country &#8211; were it not for the fanning of racism by the local
Liberals, which has given these arguments wider purchase and a
respectable face.</p>

<p>The fascists will use these and other populist arguments to try to
tap into the mood of bitterness and anger which the mainstream
politicians are shocked by but have no answer to.</p>

<p>At the same time, we should put into perspective what has actually
happened in the Isle of Dogs and how weak the far right&#8217;s prospects
still are. They have one councillor elected on just over a third of
the vote in the area. They will obviously try to use the result to
build in other inner city areas with bad housing and services. But
the scale of opposition to the BNP, and the horror felt by millions
at the result show that they will not get it all their own way.</p>

<p>It is still very easy to smash what little influence they have
built. Compare their one seat with the 1000 local government seats
held by Jean-Marie Le Pen&#8217;s National Front in France. Or compare
the support the British National Front gained in the mid-1970s. Not
only are the fascists much weaker today, there are far more people
who understand the need to oppose the Nazis.</p>

<p>This would seem to be a universal feeling. Everyone from John
Major to the editorials of the posh papers has condemned the election
result. But although these people will recoil in liberal horror &#8211;
they will do nothing to stop the Nazis. Indeed, they are already
accepting the need to work with the fascist councillor, on the
grounds of &#8216;democracy&#8217;, and condemn mobilisations against the
fascists. As in the past, in the 1930s and 1970s, beating the Nazis
will lie with rank and file activists on the ground who directly
confront them.</p>

<p>Already there are many signs that this is happening, from the
magnificent walkout of Isle of Dogs council workers who struck in
protest at having to work with a fascist councillor, to the
mobilisations in Brick Lane to drive off the Nazis and the
demonstration this month to close down the BNP headquarters in Bexley.</p>

<p>The success of the Anti Nazi League in the 1970s means that even
now it is much harder for the fascists to gain a foothold or a
respectable veneer. The mobilisations have to ensure that it stays
that way.</p>

<p>However, mobilising against the Nazis alone will not destroy the
threat. The scapegoating of blacks for bad housing and unemployment
will continue unless there is an alternative put forward. That means
fighting on the social issues whose failings give the fascists their
chance. If this fight were taken up by the whole of the labour and
trade union movement it would soon be victorious. Unfortunately, the
Labour and union leaders are apathetic or indifferent &#8211; sometimes
even hostile &#8211; to these struggles. Labour councils are often in the
forefront of implementing policies which result in at best a sharing
of the crumbs from the Tories&#8217; table.</p>

<p>In every locality there has to be a fight over these issues &#8211;
squatting empty luxury homes in Docklands, keeping hospitals open,
opposing cuts in schools. Most Labour and trade union members will
back such campaigns enthusiastically &#8211; and their leaders can be
pushed into doing so. Success in these issues will undercut any
potential base for the fascists, by providing real improvements in
people&#8217;s lives.</p>

<p>However, the crisis of politics in Britain today requires more
than these small scale reforms, important though they are in building
confidence rather than despair. It requires trying to build an
alternative to a system increasingly in decay.</p>

<p>The ruling class crisis means that there are more and more attacks
on workers coming from both employers and government. The Tory
declaration of a wage freeze is one example, which has already led to
a greater degree of generalisation among many public sector workers
than had previously been the case.</p>

<p>The main recipient of the anger and bitterness at these attacks is
not at present black people but the government itself. The wage
freeze is likely to increase the fury already growing from worsening
living standards and increased VAT on fuel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there has not yet been a significant fight by large
groups of workers against the government. The public anger over pit
closures was not turned into industrial action, and the attitude of
the trade union leaders can be summed up by the new head of the TUC:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;The job of unions is to avoid strikes, particularly
ones of any duration. There is often an initial enthusiasm among
workers when they embark on industrial action. But during strikes
income is lost, job security threatened and people are vulnerable to
victimisation. Strikes ... are a weapon of last resort.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Yet the more the union leaders counsel caution, the more they are
likely to disillusion at least a section of their membership who look
for more militant action. And the more likely it is that those who
want to fight &#8211; and the scale of the crisis is leading tens of
thousands in that direction &#8211; will look to socialist organisation
to link up and give expression to a whole range of different struggles.</p>

<p>It is commonplace for most media commentators to believe that the
crisis in politics today will easily be resolved. Maybe a new prime
minster will do the trick, or maybe economic recovery will solve the
political problems. It is not going to be like that. We have higher
taxes or further spending cuts in store, whatever happens and whoever
is in government. The 1980s, when many believed that everyone could
just get better off, have now been revealed as a cruel joke.</p>

<p>Despite all the hype during that decade, there are no clear
answers to economic crisis, to how schools can be improved, how we
can house the homeless, how we can end unemployment. Even
capitalism&#8217;s most optimistic forecasts allow for millions on the
dole and a huge &#8216;underclass&#8217; in all the major capitalist countries.</p>

<p>In such a situation the political crisis may have its ups and
downs, but it is here to stay. The best that most people can hope for
is that their personal situation will not get worse, but few believe
it. Most people accept that their children&#8217;s lives will be worse
than their own.</p>

<p>The polarisation which has opened up in politics will continue,
and is already posing the urgent question about how society goes
forward. In such circumstances, a revolutionary socialist
organisation like the SWP can grow &#8211; if it understands it has to
provide an answer to those tens of thousands looking to an
alternative to this rotten system.</p>
