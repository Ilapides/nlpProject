<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/sw-gb/1968/index.html#n0101" target="new">No. 101</a>, 14 December 1968, p.&nbsp;4.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fat">EAMONN McCANN, militant Irish socialist and <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> reporter, was cleared by Derry magistrates last week of a charge of unlawful assembly arising from the police riot on October 5.</p>

<p>Loud cheers greeted the news and McCann was carried shoulder high from the court to a mass meeting on the dockside.</p>

<p>McCann told the crowd that the court decision was not victory in a war for the civil rights movement, but only a victory in a skirmish.</p>

<p>The tactics of the O&rsquo;Neill faction in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Tory government are clear. They had meant to bring only militants before the courts.</p>

<p>But Craig, the police minister, who wants more extreme policies, charged 40 others, including Leader of the Opposition Eddie McAteer and two other MPs, Gerry Fitt and Austin Currie.</p>

<p>To imprison such respectable figures would mean committing the government to a policy of mass repression. This would lead to a break with Westminster and Rhodesia-style UDI &ndash; which Craig favours.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Neill imperialism&rsquo;s representative in Ulster, was unwilling to follow in Ian Smith&rsquo;s footsteps. Fighting back against Craig&rsquo;s ultra-right threat, he is using the courts to get himself off the hook.</p>

<p>The second set of charges, which are minor ones, have been heard first in Derry. McCann has been acquitted, and so will many of the other defendants, including the MPs.</p>

<p>Then, when the dust settles and the press turns its attention from Ulster, McCann and other hard-line militants will be back in court on charges under the South Africa-style Special Powers Act.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Solidarity</h4>

<p class="fst">DUBLIN:&ndash; 250 Young Socialists and Left-wing students marched on the British embassy last week to declare their solidarity with the militants on trial in Derry. Their path was blocked by 200 riot police.</p>

<p>Kitty O&rsquo;Kane of Derry YS told the marchers that the police action was an example of the Dublin government&rsquo;s support for the Ulster police state.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The southern establishment are just as opposed to workers on the streets demanding their rights as are the Northern Tories,&rsquo; she declared.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Long march</h4>

<p class="fst">BELFAST:&ndash; The People&rsquo;s Democracy, a non-sectarian civil rights movement, is organising a &lsquo;long march&rsquo; from Belfast to Derry (73 miles) from December 19 to 22. British socialists are invited to take part. Full details from Mike Farrell, 8 Strandview Street, Belfast 9 Tel. Belfast 669685.</p>
