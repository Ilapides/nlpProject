<p class="fat">UNITED ACTION between police and supporters of the clerical nazi Ian Paisley stopped a civil rights march in Northern Ireland on Saturday.</p>

<p>The march was part of the growing movement for voting and housing rights for the catholic minority in the Ulster police state.</p>

<p>5,000 civil rights marchers were met by a solid wall of 1,000 Paisleyites at the junction of Thompson Street and Market Street in the town centre.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Weapons</h4>

<p class="fst">The Paisleyites openly carried weapons. I saw lead pipes, police batons, pickaxe handles and table legs with nails stuck through them.</p>

<p>They were supported by 300 riot police.</p>

<p>It was victory for the thugs. They stopped the march, brazenly defied the law and, aided by the police made a triumphant tour of the city.</p>

<p>The stage was set for the victory of reaction on Friday, when 150 police entered Armagh at 7.30 in the evening.</p>

<p>After a night spent patrolling the nationalist (anti-Paisley) areas of the city, they took up positions in Market Square and held it until 5&nbsp;a.m. on Saturday, when they changed places with the vanguard of the Paisleyites, who arrived in four buses.</p>

<p>With the key position in their hands, the thugs were able to cut off approach roads from Belfast to the city centre.</p>

<p>At 8 o&rsquo;clock, the riot police returned from breakfast and placed a ring of steel around the town.</p>

<p>All vehicles except those of the Paisleyites were stopped and searched.</p>

<p>Entering the city from the north and giving my name as John Reed, I was allowed through three police road blocks.</p>

<p>Entering from the south and using the Irish form of my name, I was searched for weapons. Police ransacked the boot of my car, the glove compartments and under the seats.</p>

<p>It was an open display of police-Paisleyite collusions. As one civil rights worker said to me: &lsquo;With police like this, do we need Paisleyites?&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Solidarity</h4>

<p class="fst">ON MONDAY, the riot police moved back into Armagh to declare their solidarity with Paisleyites as they menaced a smaller demonstration by civil rights marchers.</p>

<p>100 civil rights supporters staged a sit-down in the council chamber and disrupted the monthly meeting. There were cries of &lsquo;Fascist&rsquo; when the council leader praised the police for preserving law and order on Saturday.</p>

<p>Militants wanted to march on the city centre, but nationalist leaders urged the demonstrators to disperse. Police made no effort to prevent chanting Paisleyites from occupying the roads and threatening civil rights supporters.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>On trial</h4>

<p class="fst">AS WE GO to press, charges against 46 supporters of the Civil Rights campaign were being held in Derry. The accused include our correspondent Eamonn McCann and the charges arise from the march in Derry on October 5. <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> declares its solidarity with those on trial.</p>
