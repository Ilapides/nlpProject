<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/sw-gb/1969/index.html#n0109" target="new">No. 109</a>, 15 February 1969, p.&nbsp;1.<br />

<p class="fst">BELFAST:&ndash; Peoples Democracy, the militant civil rights movement, is putting forward 11 candidates in the Northern Ireland crisis election on February 24.</p>

<p>Among constituencies which they will contest is Bannside, where Michael Farrell will oppose both Prime Minister O&rsquo;Neill and the Rev Ian Paisley.</p>

<p>And socialist Eamonn McCann is standing as a Northern Ireland Labour Party candidate in the Foyle constituency in Derry.</p>

<p>The policies on which the PD candidates will fight the election are:&ndash;</p>

<ul>
<li><I>One man, one vote</I><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><I>The repeal of the Special Powers and Public Order Acts</I><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><I>The disbandment of the armed B-Special police<br />
&nbsp;</I></li>

<li>A points system for housing and a crash programme of housebuilding, linked to the demand that the Housing Trust debt to the Central Bank be cancelled<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The direct intervention by the state in industry<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Workers&rsquo; control in the factories<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The break-up of large estates to enable small farms to form co-operatives.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h4>Highlight</h4>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The forthcoming general election, like all elections in N. Ireland, is essentially undemocratic,&rsquo; says PD in a statement. &lsquo;This is the main point which we want to highlight and change.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The statement stressed that PD remains a mass movement and that individuals within it, if elected, were committed to the struggle for civil rights both inside and outside parliament.</p>

<p>The election has been presented by the right-wing press here as a struggle between &lsquo;moderates&rsquo; and extremist Tory and Unionist forces.</p>

<p>The people who have supported PD in their civil rights campaign are combining to ignore the original alternative to a torn and discredited Tory Unionist Party and the &lsquo;half-a-loaf&rsquo; Green Nationalist Tories, who are the other side of the two-tone sectarian coin.</p>

<p>British socialists and others who want to help should contact Alan Morrison 01-969&nbsp;0915 or PD in Belfast 0232&nbsp;660861.</p>

<p class="note"><B>Money, election workers, cars and loudhailers are needed. Money to: PD, c/o Belfast Bank, Bradbury Place, Belfast 9.</B></p>
