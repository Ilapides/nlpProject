<p class="fst"><strong>IT&rsquo;S BEGINNING to dawn on Fleet Street that 22 years-old Bernadette Devlin is no student nine-day wonder to be feted and rendered harmless.</strong></p>

<p>Even after a gruelling election campaign followed by a weekend in the Bogside area of Derry, where she advised the people to form a Citizens&rsquo; Army to protect themselves from the Royal Ulster Constabulary, she has given as good as she got in interview after interview.</p>

<p>Terence O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s reputation, so far largely unsullied in the Tory press has got a hammering from which he will not recover in a hurry.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Main enemy</h4>

<p class="fst">Despite the attempts by press and interviewers to get Bernadette to praise O&rsquo;Neill, she has refused to budge from her statement that mainstream Unionism, headed at the moment by O&rsquo;Neill, is the main enemy of the civil rights movement.</p>

<p>To shocked reporters she declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The only difference between O&rsquo;Neill and the Paisleyites is that the unfortunate Paisleyites don&rsquo;t have hyphenated names. The Unionist rebels want to walk over us with hob-nailed boots, O&rsquo;Neill would use carpet slippers.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Bernadette joined the civil rights campaign last August when she took part in a march from Coalisland to Dungannon, where she was kicked by stewards because she shouted slogans other than the official ones.</p>

<p>In Derry on October 5 she supported Eamonn McCann&rsquo;s call that the march should defy the ban placed on it by Police Minister William Craig.</p>

<p>The resulting RUC brutality confirmed to Bernadette that she must take a full part in the campaign.</p>

<p>In the following week she took part in the founding of People&rsquo;s Democracy, the mainly student body which was to play a major part in the movement from then on.</p>

<p>When the middle of the road leaders of both the Derry Citizen&rsquo;s Action Committee and the Civil Rights Association tried to use the sacking of Craig as a signal to call off the campaign, Bernadette was one of those who struggled to break the truce.</p>

<p>On the famous &ldquo;long march&rdquo; from Belfast to Derry in January the action which effectively smashed the truce, Bernadette underwent another transformation. The young &lsquo;do-gooding&rsquo; student saw the need to fight against the right-wing in the movement as part of the fight against Toryism in Ireland, North and South.</p>

<p>In the General Election which followed the second split in the Tory Party she was picked to fight Major James Chichester-Clark for the South Derry seat. She won the highest vote of the eight PD candidates.</p>

<p>The poll and the non-sectarian manner in which she put across the PD message set the pace for Mid-Ulster. The seat was set to become the cockpit for a great faction fight as Green Tory carpetbaggers like Austin Currie turned first left then right in an attempt to project himself as the all-purpose unity candidate.</p>

<p>The grass-roots anti-Unionists demanded and got a say in the selection of the candidate to fight the Orange Tory. A unity convention was agreed to.</p>

<p>Even before the convention it was clear that Bernadette was the choice of the &lsquo;white negroes&rsquo; and the only non-Unionist candidate who stood a hope of getting any Protestant votes.</p>

<p>The Tories tried to destroy her with a communist scare. The fact that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s tiny CP was backing one of the nationalist Tories was neither here nor there.</p>

<p>The diversions failed. Bernadette stormed to victory with Protestant as well as Catholic votes and hammered another nail in the coffin of the Tory police state.</p>
