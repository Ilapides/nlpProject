<p class="fst">DERRY:&ndash; 30 homeless families organised by Derry Labour Party moved in and occupied 30 houses last weekend, that had been built for the British navy in the high-class residential area of Clooney Park.</p>

<p>The Labour Party called a meeting of squatters on the estate and a tenants&rsquo; association has been formed that will take responsibility for protecting the squatters.</p>

<p>On Monday I visited the squatters at Clooney Park and saw children playing on swings and seesaws possibly for the first time in their lives.</p>

<p>This is the largest and most successful squatters&rsquo; occupation in Ireland since the war, but its success still leaves the civil rights movement in a very weak position compared with just a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Squatting on its own is only reformism by illegal means. Three weeks ago the whole question of power, at least in Derry, was on the agenda.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Question</h4>

<p class="fst">Today the high point is the occupation of 30 houses. The Left in Ireland must question the policies and methods that have allowed this transformation to take place.</p>

<p>Blaming middle-of-the-road MPs like John Hume is no substitute for a clear programme and a serious attempt to implement it.</p>

<p>The mistakes, political and organisational, that passed unnoticed when the movement was on the upsurge, are now coming home to roost. The Left must take advantage of the present lull to do sane serious thinking about what is to be done.</p>
