<p class="fst">TENS OF THOUSANDS of Ulstermen and women voted to return the civil rights campaign to the streets. This is one clear message from Northern Ireland&rsquo;s snap coupon election.</p>

<p>A massive attempt to swing the &lsquo;white negroes&rsquo; of John Bull&rsquo;s other island behind the half-a-loaf policy of Tory Premier O&rsquo;Neill failed. Catholic working people refused to follow the lead of the Catholic upper class.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Swing</h4>

<p class="fst">Not only has O&rsquo;Neill-style Tory Unionism failed to win the Catholic vote, but the beginning of the end for the Green Tory Nationalists is in sight &ndash; with the start of a swing to the Left &ndash; the real Left.</p>

<p>Eight People&rsquo;s Democracy candidates polled over 20,000 votes between them while four other candidates known to support the <em>PD Manifesto</em> totalled a further 13,000 votes.</p>

<p>The swing to the Left is confirmed by results from the last two constituencies. In South Down PDs Fergus Wood polled 4,610, less than 250 short of victory.</p>

<p>In neighbouring South Armagh, Newry PD member Paddy O&rsquo;Hanlon, standing as an Independent, won the seat from Green Tory, Eddie Richardson.</p>

<p>It was a major breakthrough for the Irish Left, the more so when one understands the handicaps.</p>

<p>A snap election left only 10 days to raise cash before the close of nominations.</p>

<p>PD is not a political party and most of its members had never taken part in an election before. The bulk of PD&rsquo;s support comes from the youth who have no vote.</p>

<p>The election was based on the old register. More than 20,000 young people over 21 had no vote.</p>

<p>Many electors had never voted in Stormont elections before. PD candidates were unable to enter some areas to put their case to the people.</p>

<p>A vicious slander campaign &ndash; especially in Derry &ndash; reached an all-time low even for an Irish election.</p>

<p>There was tacit unity between the Orange and Green Tories to &lsquo;smash the Reds&rsquo;. The agreement was highlighted in South Fermanagh where the Orange Order was used to rally support for Nationalist John Carran, who has a deal with the Unionists to keep the civil rights campaign out of his area.</p>

<p><strong>Tribune</strong> published a PD appeal for funds on page two last week. On the back page their Irish correspondent, Andrew Boyd, claimed falsely that PD had ample funds.</p>

<p>Boyd in the same article, written after nomination closed with no Unionist candidate in Foyle, accused Eamonn McCann of splitting the anti-Unionist vote and leaving &lsquo;enough room for a Unionist to canter through&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, the ex-stalinist political correspondent of the pinky <strong>Irish Times</strong>, alleged that the Left wanted O&rsquo;Neill out to put the ultra-right in power.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Militant</h4>

<p class="fst">The <em>Unionist Party Manifesto</em> culled a paragraph from the Republican <em>Proclamation of 1916</em> and a leading Unionist claimed that James Connolly would have supported O&rsquo;Neill.</p>

<p>Against these odds, despite some serious political and organisational mistakes, People&rsquo;s Democracy won tens of thousands to a programme of militant struggle on the streets, for full civil and social rights new. It is a record to be proud of.</p>
