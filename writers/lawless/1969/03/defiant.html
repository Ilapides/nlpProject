<p class="fst">THE NORTH of Ireland&rsquo;s biggest and most dramatic day of protest went off last Sunday without any major violence.</p>

<p>It was a day of triumph for People&rsquo;s Democracy and other militants in the civil rights campaign who carried through the demonstrations in six major centres despite threats from the Paisleyites and obstruction from the right wing of the civil rights movement.</p>

<p>The protests had been called by PD and the Derry Labour Party against the new Public Order Bill.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Blocked traffic</h4>

<p class="fst"><strong>In Derry</strong>, more than 5000 answered the Labour Party&rsquo;s call and blocked traffic for two hours in a massive demonstration in the heart of the city.</p>

<p>Eammon McCann, who presided, said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;We have been told that there are now two types of unionists. One section want to walk over us with hobnail boots and the other section, led by O&rsquo;Neill, want to walk over us in carpet slippers.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="quote">&lsquo;The people of Derry,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;are not going to allow anyone to walk over them ever again.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Following the sit-down, there was a march by young men to the Royal Ulster Constabulary Barracks where windows were smashed. The RUC remained discreetly out of sight and there were no arrests.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Burnt Bill</h4>

<p class="fst"><strong>In Armagh</strong>, 1,500 people attended a meeting in the market square where a copy of the Public Order Bill was burnt.</p>

<p>About 1,000 marchers in <strong>Enniskillen</strong> had their march prematurely ended by the RUC at Erne Bridge. The demonstration which was organised by PD, was addressed by Paddy Devlin, MP, Paddy Kennedy, MP, Michael Farrell and Peter Cosgrove of PD.</p>

<p>The last of the demonstrations at Toomebridge, Co. Antrim, passed off without incident.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Blundered</h4>

<p class="fst">In spite of a major speech by O&rsquo;Neill on Tuesday night, defending the Public Order Bill, it is clear that the Ulster Unionists have blundered badly. The Bill outlaws sit-downs or sit-ins.</p>

<p>Last weekend&rsquo;s events have made it clear that the RUC do not have enough men to enforce the law once a campaign against it is organised.</p>

<p>The only way open to O&rsquo;Neill if he is not to see the law flouted every weekend, is to call up the B-specials which means putting uniforms on Paisleyites. Such a move will be understood by the people for what it is &ndash; a declaration of civil war.</p>
