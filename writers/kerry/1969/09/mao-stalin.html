<p class="fst">The myth of Stalin&#8217;s infallibility was assiduously
cultivated by the ruling bureaucratic caste in the Soviet Union until
his death in 1953. The <em>parvenu</em> bureaucracy, which had usurped
the state power, required a supreme arbiter to adjudicate its disputes
and to reconcile any differences that might arise among members of the
ruling group. During his lifetime Stalin had the last word and final
decision.</p>
<p>By the time of Stalin&#8217;s death the world had undergone considerable
change. The Soviet Union was no longer the sole custodian of
&#8220;socialist&#8221; state power, upon whose authority the whole structure of
Stalinist monolithism was erected. The social overturns in Eastern
Europe and above all, the conquest of state power by the Chinese
Communist Party [CCP], introduced a schismatic process that gave rise
to &#8220;polycentrism&#8221;&#8212;that is, the conflict of interests inherent in the
existence of separate national states, albeit national states resting
on the foundation of socialist property forms and property relations.</p>

<p>With other times, came other needs. Stalin&#8217;s heirs found it
expedient to initiate the process of deStalinization. The myth of
Stalin&#8217;s infallibility was thoroughly demolished in the famous speech
by Nikita Khrushchev at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union in 1956. Recently, under the inspiration of the Maoists,
there has been a concerted attempt to refurbish the Stalin myth. But
this is a hopeless task. Not all the king&#8217;s horses and all the king&#8217;s
men can ever put humpty-dumpty Stalin back together again!</p>
<p>The Maoists need the Stalin myth to bolster an official mythology
which seeks to elevate Mao to the status of a deity whose supernatural
omnipotence&#8212;Mao&#8217;s thought&#8212;is invested with retroactive
infallibility to prove that he was <em>always</em> right in the past&#8212;
even as against Stalin. Past errors, where admitted, are attributed to
the shortcomings of others.</p>
<p>It would be instructive to unravel the strands of this deification
of Mao. In this article, however, we are concerned with a myth of a
different order, the concept that Mao broke with Stalin to lead the
Chinese revolution. This &#8220;theory&#8221; has been advanced in order to answer
the seeming enigmas: How explain that the Chinese Communist Party,
under a Stalinist leadership closely linked with the Kremlin, could
carry through a revolutionary action and take state power in seeming
contradiction to Stalin&#8217;s policy of class collaboration and peaceful
coexistence?</p>
<p>This widely current myth of a Mao-Stalin schism on revolutionary
strategy has unfortunately been taken up and elaborated in a recent
collection of essays edited by Tariq Ali, the Pakistan-born British
antiwar leader who has become a Trotskyist. <a id="f1" href="#n1"
name="f1" target="_blank" >[1]</a></p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Stalin,&#8221; writes Ali, &#8220;had not believed that a
socialist revolution was possible in China; his disastrous policies had
resulted in the massacres of Shanghai and Canton. Perhaps he believed
that since most of the leading Communist cadres had been wiped out it
was now fairly safe for him to deal with Chiang Kai-shek. Stalin had
reckoned without Mao Tse-tung. It is not necessary to go into details
of how Mao organized the Chinese Communist Party and led it to victory.
What is important to note is that if Mao had followed Stalin&#8217;s advice
he would have disbanded the Chinese party and merged with Chiang
Kai-shek&#8217;s nationalists and in the process would, no doubt, have been
liquidated. Despite paying lip-service to Stalin, Mao in fact did
exactly the opposite. He fought the most protracted civil war in recent
history, with no material aid from Stalin. Unless, of course, one
counts a manual on partisan warfare which Stalin sent him as a gift and
which Mao handed to Liu Shao-chi with the inscription: &#8216;Read this
carefully if you want to end up dead.&#8217; [Ali does not explain the source
of this story. But it is of such stuff that myths are woven.&#8212;<em>T.K.</em>]</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;The success of Mao&#8217;s armies,&#8221; Ali continues, &#8220;came as
a shock to Stalin; right up to 1948 he had been persuading the Chinese
Communists to come to some sort of agreement with the nationalists and
this the Chinese steadfastly, and to their credit, refused to do. In
October, 1949, exactly thirty-two years after the Bolshevik revolution,
Mao&#8217;s peasant armies marched into Peking and proclaimed China a
People&#8217;s Republic.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Tariq Ali concludes his essay on the Chinese revolution
with the assertion, &#8220;Mao&#8217;s stature as one of the greatest revolutionary
leaders of this century is beyond question.&#8221; But the actual record
which I propose to examine far from bears out this judgment. If Stalin
had not believed that a socialist revolution was possible in China, as
Ali correctly asserts, neither had Mao. And Mao persisted in this
disbelief to the very end. That is why he proclaimed China a People&#8217;s
Republic and not a Socialist Soviet Republic, as the Bolsheviks had
done in October 1917.</p>
<p>Tariq Ali wrote this article for the anthology before the
announcement of his adherence to the International Marxist Group, the
British section of the Fourth International. Earlier this year, in a
valuable eyewitness report from Pakistan, he published some trenchant
criticism of the attitudes of the Chinese leadership and the native
Maoists toward the mass upheavals against the military dictatorship in
that country. <a id="f2" href="#n2" name="f2" target="_blank" >[2]</a><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Milovan Djilas&#8217; <em>Conversations with Stalin</em></h4>
<p class="fst">Considering the historic significance of the events and
the multitude of writings about them, there is remarkably little
evidence to support the theory that Mao broke with Stalin during the
Chinese revolution. Milovan Djilas reports a statement by Stalin in his
<strong>Conversations with Stalin</strong> published in 1962. It
concerned the postwar uprising in Greece, which Stalin insisted &#8220;must
be stopped, and as quickly as possible&#8221; according to the former high
Yugoslav official.</p>
<p>Djilas writes,</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Someone mentioned the recent successes of the
Chinese Communists. But Stalin remained adamant: &#8216;Yes, the Chinese
comrades have succeeded, but in Greece there is an entirely different
situation. The United States is directly engaged there&#8212;the strongest
state in the world. China is a different case, relations in the Far
East are different. True, we, too, can make a mistake! Here, when the
war with Japan ended, we invited the Chinese comrades to reach an
agreement as to how a <em>modus vivendi</em> with Chiang Kai-shek
might be found. They agreed with us in word, but in deed they did it
their own way when they got home: They mustered their forces and
struck. It has been shown that they were right, and not we. But Greece
is a different case&#8212;we should not hesitate, but let us put an end to
the Greek uprising.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Djilas&#8217; assertion is of dubious validity. The alleged
conversation occurred in February 1948 when sharp differences had
already arisen between Stalin and the Yugoslavs. Soon after this the
Kremlin launched a public attack on the Yugoslav leaders and the open
break occurred in June, 1948. It was not in character for Stalin to
confess his &#8220;errors,&#8221; certainly not to the Yugoslavs at that time.</p>
<p>Djilas did draw a generalization that is, on the whole, valid:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;As far as the pacification of the Chinese revolution
was concerned, here [Stalin] was undoubtedly led by opportunism in his
foreign policy. Nor can it be excluded that he anticipated future
danger to his own work and to his own empire from the new Communist
great power, especially since there were no prospects of subordinating
it internally. At any rate, he knew that every revolution, simply by
virtue of being new, also becomes a separate epicenter and shapes its
own government and state, and this was what he feared in the Chinese
case, all the more since the phenomenon was involved that was as
significant and as momentous as the October revolution.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Since the book was written in 1961, however, thirteen
years after the event and at a time when the Sino-Soviet dispute had
erupted, it is hard to decide whether to attribute Djilas&#8217; prescience
to foresight or hindsight. Stalin tried to guard against this &#8220;future
danger&#8221; by innovating a new state form standing somewhere between a
capitalist state and workers state, which he dubbed a people&#8217;s state,
or a people&#8217;s democracy or people&#8217;s republic. There was no difference
on this score between Mao and Stalin.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Maoist criticisms of Stalin</h4>
<p class="fst">Aside from the Djilas revelation there is the evidence
of differences between Mao and Stalin cited by the Maoists themselves.
As part of the polemic between Peking and Moscow, the editorial
departments of <strong>Renmin Ribao (People&#8217;s Daily</strong>)
and <strong>Hongqi</strong> (<strong>Red Flag</strong>) published a
violent attack on Khrushchev&#8217;s 20th Congress speech, September 13,
1963. The article, republished as a pamphlet, was entitled <em>On the
Question of Stalin.</em> In sort of a bookkeeper&#8217;s approach to
politics, it totes up the pluses and minuses of Stalin&#8217;s career and
concludes that, on balance, the pluses outnumber the minuses:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Stalin&#8217;s merits and mistakes are matters of
historical, objective reality. A comparison of the two shows that his
merits outweighed his faults. He was primarily correct, and his faults
were secondary.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">One &#8220;error&#8221; mentioned is the frightful blood-purges of
the 1930s which decimated Lenin&#8217;s Bolshevik Party.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In the work led by Stalin of suppressing the
counterrevolution, many counterrevolutionaries deserving punishment
were duly punished, but at the same time there were innocent people who
were wrongly convicted; and in 1937 and 1938 there occurred the error
of enlarging the scope of the suppression of counterrevolutionaries. In
the matter of the party and government organization, he did not fully
apply proletarian democratic centralism and, to some extent, violated
it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">How delicately put! The &#8220;error&#8221; of committing
fratricide, you see, was a &#8220;fault&#8221; of secondary rank and hardly worth
mentioning.</p>
<p>Stalin&#8217;s basic &#8220;error,&#8221; according to Mao&#8217;s pundits, was his failure
to master Mao&#8217;s thoughts. For, they explain:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In struggles inside as well as outside the party, on
certain occasions and on certain questions he confused two types of
contradictions which are different in nature, contradictions between
ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, and also
confused the different methods needed in handling them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">What unadulterated tripe!</p>
<p>On the question of Stalin&#8217;s errors in China the authors are quite
vague. In one passage they remark that Stalin &#8220;had given <em>some</em>

bad counsel with regard to the Chinese revolution. After the victory of
the Chinese revolution,&#8221; they assert, &#8220;he admitted his mistake.&#8221; But
the nature of this &#8220;mistake,&#8221; when it was supposed to have occurred in
the Chinese revolution, and where Stalin admitted he was wrong, the
authors do not say. They hasten on to another subject.</p>
<p>One more instance is cited:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Long ago,&#8221; they write, &#8220;the Chinese Communists had
firsthand experience of some of his mistakes. Of the erroneous &#8216;Left&#8217;
and Right opportunist lines which emerged in the Chinese Communist
Party at one time or another, some arose under the influence of certain
mistakes of Stalin&#8217;s, in so far as their international sources were
concerned. In the late twenties, the thirties and the early and middle
forties, the Chinese Marxist-Leninists represented by Mao Tse-tung and
Liu Shao-chi resisted the influence of Stalin&#8217;s mistakes; they
gradually overcame the erroneous lines of &#8216;Left&#8217; and Right opportunism
and finally led the Chinese revolution to victory.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">This pamphlet was published in 1963, when Liu&#8217;s name was
still intimately coupled with that of Mao and before the &#8220;cultural
revolution&#8221; disclosed that Liu Shao-chi was an imperialist agent, a
diversionist and wrecker, as far back as 1924, the year the Chinese
Communist Party first cemented an alliance with the Kuomintang. But
that is another story. In what now reads as a monumental bit of irony,
the authors of <em>On the Question of Stalin</em> contend that the
Chinese Communist Party always disavowed the &#8220;cult of the personality&#8221;:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;While we attach importance [to] the role of
leaders,&#8221; they aver, &#8220;we are against dishonest and excessive eulogy of
individuals and exaggeration of their role.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">At any rate, this is the extent of the Maoist record of
Stalin&#8217;s &#8220;mistakes&#8221; in China. It hardly constitutes proof of a break
between Mao and Stalin on the question of the character or course of
the Chinese revolution of 1949. In fact, the authors of <em>On the
Question of Stalin</em> insist:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;But since some of the wrong ideas put forward by
Stalin were accepted and applied by certain Chinese comrades, we
Chinese should bear the responsibility. In its struggle against &#8216;Left&#8217;
and Right opportunism, therefore, our party criticized only its own
erring comrades and <em>never put the blame on Stalin</em>.&#8221; (Emphasis
added.)</p>
<p class="fst">Far from placing any &#8220;blame on Stalin&#8221; for &#8220;mistakes&#8221;
made in the course of the Chinese revolution, Maoist historians go to
great lengths to establish the fact that Mao was Stalin&#8217;s foremost
disciple. On the occasion of Stalin&#8217;s seventieth birthday, Chen Po-ta,
a leading exponent of the &#8220;cultural revolution&#8221; and militant
protagonist of &#8220;Mao&#8217;s thought,&#8221; composed a eulogy entitled <em>Stalin
and the Chinese Revolution</em>. It was published by the People&#8217;s
Publishing House, Peking, May 1953. Here are samples of Chen Po-ta&#8217;s
testimony on the question of Stalin&#8217;s &#8220;errors&#8221; and the relations
between Mao and Stalin:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung, our
party, by advancing along a devious path, finally overcame both the
objective difficulties and subjective errors and carried the revolution
to victory. This is because Comrade Mao Tse-tung&#8217;s views on the nature
and tactics of the Chinese revolution were based on the teachings of
Stalin and were identical with the views of Stalin.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;Comrade Mao Tse-tung is Stalin&#8217;s disciple and comrade
in arms. He is Stalin&#8217;s outstanding disciple and has been able to lead
China&#8217;s revolution to victory because his method of work and his way of
reasoning are those of Stalin. He uses Stalin&#8217;s methods to learn from
Stalin ...&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">And so forth and so on, <em>ad nauseam</em>.</p>
<p>It is quite obvious that the brief references by Mao and his
historians to &#8220;subjective errors&#8221; and &#8220;mistakes&#8221; do not refer to
Stalin&#8217;s basic line on the character and perspective of the Chinese
revolution. Because of the disastrous consequences of the zig-zag
policies followed by the Stalintern afier the death of Lenin, it became
standard practice to fix the blame on those individuals and groups
responsible for and identified with the carrying out of the &#8220;general
line.&#8221; Thus arose the system of scapegoatism. With each zig-zag new
leaders were created and old ones scrapped as &#8220;Left&#8221; or &#8220;Right&#8221;
opportunists, depending on the thrust of the new turn. No one dared
place the blame on Stalin&#8212;where it properly belonged. It was along
this &#8220;devious path&#8221; that Mao became head of the Chinese Communist Party
in January 1935.</p>

<p>The date is significant. Following the debacle of Stalin&#8217;s &#8220;Third
Period&#8221; insanity, which paved the way for Hitler&#8217;s march to power in
Germany, the Stalintern made a one hundred and eighty degree turn to
the People&#8217;s Front. The leaders of the national sections of the
Communist International were junked in wholesale lots, including the
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. That Mao was a People&#8217;s
Frontist from the beginning is testified to by Chen Po-ta in his
pamphlet, <strong>Mao Tse-tung on the Chinese Revolution</strong>,
written in 1951 and published in a revised edition in Peking in 1963.</p>
<p class="quoteb">After 1927 Mao repeatedly refuted the erroneous
&#8216;Leftist&#8217; ideological trend in relation to the question of the
character of the revolution. He considered that the Chinese democratic
revolution must be carried out to the end, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Only in this way can a socialist future of the
Chinese revolution be fostered. Misconceptions such as denying this
period of democratic revolution and considering that the opportune
moment for a socialist revolution in China has arrived are extremely
detrimental to the Chinese revolution.&#8221; (<em>Resolution of the Sixth
Congress of the Fourth Army of the Red Army</em>, drafted by Mao
Tse-tung, December 1928.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="quoteb">Mao Tse-tung regarded the opinion then held by the
Communist International that the character of the Chinese revolution
remained bourgeois-democratic as completely correct. He said, &#8220;the
struggle which we have gone through verifies the truth of the opinion
of the Communist International.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quote">In the light of the concrete conditions in China, Mao
Tse-tung developed the teachings of Lenin and Stalin regarding the
continuous development of the bourgeois-democratic revolution into the
socialist revolution.</p>
<p class="fst">He said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We advocate the theory of the continuous development
of revolution, but not the Trotskyite theory of permanent revolution.
We stand for the attainment of socialism through all the necessary
stages of the democratic republic. We are opposed to tail-ism, but we
are also opposed to adventurism and ultra-revolutionism.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The theory of the revolution in stages was not unique
with Mao and the Popular Front. It was developed as part of the
theoretical arsenal of the reformist socialists in Europe and was
advocated by the Russian Mensheviks in opposition to the course
followed by the Bolsheviks. The latter, under Lenin and Trotsky&#8217;s
leadership, refused to halt the revolution at its &#8220;bourgeois-democratic
stage&#8221; following the overthrow of the Czar in February. They pressed
forward to the socialist victory of October, along the line laid down
by Trotsky in his theory of permanent revolution.</p>
<p>The theory of the revolution in stages leads ineluctably to the
practice of class collaboration through coalitionism. If the bourgeois
democratic stage was to prevail for a prolonged period&#8212;as Mao
insisted it must&#8212;then the Chinese Communist Party would have to share
power, as junior partner, with the political parties of the
bourgeoisie, above all with Chiang Kai-shek&#8217;s Kuomintang.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The theory of revolution in stages</h4>
<p class="fst">Mao&#8217;s views on coalition government were elaborated in a
political report to the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party on April 24, 1945. The first Chinese edition in
English, entitled <strong>On Coalition Government</strong>, was
published in 1955. However, the text of this speech was published ten
years earlier in this country in December 1945 by New Century
Publishers, the Communist Party publishing house, with the title <strong>The
Fight for a New China</strong>, and with an introduction by William Z.
Foster. There are extensive changes, alterations, amendments and
deletions in the later Chinese editions compared to the 1945 text. The
citations which follow are from the earlier New Century edition.</p>
<p>In expounding the theory of the revolution in stages, Mao declared,</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Socialism can be reached only through democracy;
this is an accepted truth of Marxism. The struggle for democracy in
China still requires a prolonged period. Without a new democratic,
united state, without the economic development of a new democratic
nation, without the development of a broad private capitalist and
cooperative economy, without the development of a national, scientific,
popular and new democratic culture, without the emancipation and
development of the individuality of hundreds of millions of people, in
short, without the thorough, new bourgeois democratic revolution, to
establish socialism over the ruins of the colonial, semi-colonial, and
semi-feudal China would be a Utopian dream.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">How explain that &#8220;Communists&#8221; advocate the
establishment, for a &#8220;prolonged period,&#8221; of a bourgeois-democratic
state?</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Some people cannot understand why the Communists,
far from being antipathetic to capitalism, actually promote its
development. To them we can simply say this much: to replace the
oppression of foreign imperialism and native feudalism with the
development of capitalism is not only an advance, but also an
unavoidable process; it will benefit not only the capitalist class, but
also the proletariat.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">But, if the historical imperative dictates that the
course of development proceed through the stage of bourgeois democracy,
how explain the Russian revolution, which proceeded from the overthrow
of the semi-feudal Czarist regime to the establishment of the
bourgeois-democratic Provisional Government, to an abbreviated period
of Soviet dual power, to the establishment of the proletarian
dictatorship, all within the span of a few months? Mao advances a
theory of Russian exceptionalism.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Some people wonder if the Communists, once in power,
will establish a dictatorship by the proletariat and a one-party
system, as they have done in the Soviet Union. We can tell these people
this: A new democracy of a union of democratic classes is different in
principle from a socialist state with the dictatorship of the
proletariat. China, throughout the period of her new democratic system,
cannot and should not have a system of government of one-class
dictatorship or one-party monopoly of government.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">As for Russia:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Russian history determined the Soviet form of
society. There the social system in which man exploits man has been
abolished; a new democratic (socialist) political, economic and
cultural system has been established; all anti-socialist political
parties have been rejected by the people, who support only the
Bolshevik Party. But even in Russia, where the Bolshevik Party is the
only political party, the governmental authority is invested in the
alliance of workers, peasants and intellectuals, or in the bloc of
party members and non-party members, and not in the hands of the
working class, or Bolsheviks alone. In the same way, Chinese history
will determine the Chinese system. A unique form&#8212;a new democratic
state and regime or a union of the democratic classes&#8212;will be
produced, which will be different from the Russian system.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;The carrying out of this program will not advance
China to socialism. This is not a question of the subjective
willingness or unwillingness of certain individuals to do the
advancing; it is due to the fact that the objective political and
social conditions in China do not permit the advance.&#8221; <a id="f3"
href="#n3" name="f3" target="_blank" >[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">For how long?</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In the entire bourgeois democratic revolution stage,
over scores of years, our new democratic general program is unchanged.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Relations between capital and labor</h4>
<p class="fst">Mao paints an idyllic picture of the harmonious
relations that will exist between capital and labor in the &#8220;bourgeois
democratic revolution&#8221; stage.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Under the new democratic state the policy of
harmonizing the relationship between capital and labor will be adopted.
The interests of the workers will be protected. An eight to ten-hour
day system, according to varying circumstances, will be established, as
well as suitable relief for the unemployed, social security, and the
rights of labor unions. On the other hand, the proper profits, under
reasonable management, of state, private and cooperative enterprises
will be assured. Thus, both labor and capital will work jointly for the
development of industrial production.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">One of the more persistent tenets of Maoist mythology is
the alleged uncompromising hostility that Mao always held toward the
imperialist powers, especially toward British and American imperialism.
It is no wonder that those sections of his speech in which he expresses
gratitude to these powers are carefully deleted from the revised
Chinese versions. For example, in expressing his gratitude to the
Soviet Union for its help, he adds:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We are also grateful to Britain and the United
States, particularly the latter, for their immense contribution to the
common cause&#8212;the defeat of the Japanese aggressors. We are grateful
to the governments and the peoples of both countries for their sympathy
with the Chinese people and their help.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">But gratitude never cut much ice with the imperialist
bandits. Mao dangled more tangible material benefits to whet their
appetites. In the bourgeois-democratic stage, he pointed out,</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Large amounts of capital will be needed for the
development of our industries. They will come chiefly from the
accumulated wealth of the Chinese people, and at the same time from
foreign assistance. We welcome foreign investments if such are
beneficial to China&#8217;s economy and are made in accordance with China&#8217;s
laws. Enterprises profitable to both the Chinese people and foreigners
are swiftly expanding large-scale light and heavy industries and
modernizing agriculture, which can become a reality when there is a
firm internal and international peace, and when political and agrarian
reforms are thoroughly carried out. On this basis, we shall be able to
absorb vast amounts of foreign investments. A politically retrogressive
and economically impoverished China will be unprofitable not only to
the Chinese people, but also to foreigners.&#8221; <a id="f4" href="#n4"
name="f4" target="_blank" >[4]</a></p>
<p class="fst">In the light of subsequent developments it is no wonder
that the Maoists subjected the text of <strong>On Coalition Government</strong>
to extensive revisions. In his foreword to the American edition,
William Z. Foster indicated the setting in which the speech was made.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;On April 24, 1945,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;the day on which the
great Chinese Communist leader, Mao Tse-tung, delivered the following
report to the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party,
Allied unity was at a high point. On the following day the United
Nations Conference was to open in San Francisco. In Europe the Red Army
from the East and Anglo-American forces from the West were rapidly
bringing to an end the Hitler state and the Nazi armies. Rangoon and
Davao were about to fall to the Allies in the Pacific theater. American
Marines were writing a glorious chapter in military history in Okinawa.
The Soviet Union had already made clear its intention of joining the
war against Japan by abrogating its treaty with the Mikado.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">These military victories induced a condition of euphoria
in Stalinist circles throughout the world. Coalitionism, i.e., class
collaboration, was touted as the wave of the future. On the basis of
the pacts and agreements forged by the Big Three (Teheran, Yalta, etc.)
the class struggle was declared outmoded. Peaceful coexistence was to
reign supreme. With the exception of the Soviet Union, of course, the
struggle for socialism was postponed to the Greek Kalends. In Europe,
the French Communist Party entered a coalition government, disarmed the
Resistance and, along with de Gaulle, proceeded to restore the
bourgeois democratic order. The same process was duplicated in Italy.
In Eastern Europe, coalition governments were hastily rigged under the
umbrella of Soviet occupation forces.</p>
<p>To the consternation of the Stalinist pipedream of an era of
permanent peace and prosperity following the war, however, the
imperialist jackals resumed their scramble for spheres of influence,
markets, areas for the investment of capital, sources of raw material,
the super-exploitation of cheap labor and colonial dominion. The war
had changed nothing in the nature of the beast. It was not that the
wartime coalition was being &#8220;pried apart&#8221;&#8212;as the Stalinists cried&#8212;
it was coming apart at the seams by virtue of its inherent
contradictions. The class struggle, so cavalierly consigned to the
limbo of innocuous desuetude, soon asserted its lusty presence.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Dual power in the Chinese revolution</h4>

<p class="fst">In China, the path to coalition government was bestrewn
with booby traps. The Chinese Communist Party headed a surging mass
movement that made it a power to be reckoned with. The Japanese
invasion of China in the 1930s sparked a recurrent and mounting wave of
nationalist feeling that infected all sections of the population. The
CCP rode that wave from the beginning. Stalin viewed a Japanese
military presence in China with considerable alarm. It was a dagger
pointed at the 3,000-mile Soviet eastern frontier and held the threat
of a war on two fronts in the event of a military conflict in Europe.</p>
<p>In <strong>Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China</strong>,
published by Lawrence and Wishart in 1951, Hu Chiao-mu, the
vice-director of the propaganda department of the CCP central committee
wrote that,</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... after the Japanese invaders had attacked China
the Chinese Communist Party was the first to call for armed resistance.
In January 1933, the Chinese Workers&#8217; and Peasants&#8217; Red Army declared
that, on the three conditions of ceasing the attacks on the Red Army,
safeguarding the peoples&#8217; democratic rights and arming the masses, the
Red Army was willing &#8220;to stop fighting and make peace with all other
troops throughout the country for the purpose of jointly resisting
Japanese aggression.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Needless to say, Chiang Kai-shek rejected the proposal.
The Kuomintang had less to fear from the Japanese invaders than from
the Red Army. Instead, Chiang mounted a series of major military
campaigns designed to encircle and destroy the Red Army. As a result of
these offensives the Red Army was compelled to undertake its &#8220;Long
March&#8221; to seek sanctuary in the remote Chinese hinterland. After
incredible hardships the Red Army reached North Shensi in October 1935.
Hu writes that before the retreat &#8220;the Red Army had expanded into a
force of 300,000 troops, but after reaching North Shensi at the end of
the Long March ... the Red Army totalled less than 30,000 troops.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the decrepit and corrupt Kuomintang government offered no
effective resistance to the Japanese invaders. Dissatisfaction grew and
along with mounting discontent a process of disintegration ensued which
led to splits and defections by dissident groups in the Chiang forces.
A number joined with the Red Army to carry forward the resistance. In
the process, the Red Army and the Chinese Communist Party underwent an
enormous expansion. Hu reports that by the time of the Mao speech at
the Seventh Congress in April of 1945, there had been created under the
leadership of the CCP, &#8220;nineteen Liberated Areas ... with a total
population of 95,500,000, a People&#8217;s Liberation Army of 910,000
(including the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Route Army and other
anti-Japanese people&#8217;s troops) and a people&#8217;s militia of 2,200,000 men
who were simultaneously engaged in production.&#8221; Even allowing for some
exaggeration, this was a force of considerable magnitude.</p>
<p>When the war in the Pacific ended with the unconditional surrender
of Japan on August 14, 1945, de facto dual power existed in China.
Unlike Russia in 1917, where the dual power was institutionalized in
the form of Soviets of workers, peasants and soldiers deputies on one
side, and the bourgeois government on the other, the dual power in
China took the form of rival armies engaged in military conflict. The
state, wrote Engels, consists of bodies of armed men. In China the Red
Army exercised state power in the &#8220;liberated areas&#8221; through the
administrative apparatus of the CCP and its &#8220;democratic allies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hu Chiao-mu explains that the areas under Red Army control were
adminstered by a &#8220;coalition&#8221; whereby</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... the &#8216;Three-threes representative system,&#8217; namely
the system whereby the Communists (representing the working class and
poor peasants), the progressive elements (representing the petty
bourgeoisie), and the intermediate elements (representing the middle
bourgeoisie and enlightened gentry) each contributed one-third of the
leading personnel of the government administration, was introduced in
all Liberated Areas.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">But the real power resided in the Red Army controlled by
the CCP.</p>
<p>This power existed alongside that of the National government ruled
by Chiang Kai-shek and his Kuomintang under a system of &#8220;political
tutelage,&#8221; the political formula for Chiang&#8217;s one-party dictatorship.
Chiang&#8217;s regime was recognized as the legitimate &#8220;national government&#8221;
by the &#8220;Big Three,&#8221; Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin, in the Moscow
Declaration of October 30, 1943. In fact, upon the insistence of
Roosevelt, the Big Three was expanded to include Nationalist China and
became the Big Four, with the addition of Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p><strong>The China White Paper</strong>, originally issued in August
1949 under the title <strong>United States Relations With China, With
Special Reference to the Period 1944-49</strong>, records that in the
fall of 1943:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The United States insisted that China be included as
a signatory, together with the United Kingdom, the USSR, and the United
States, of the Declaration of Four Nations on General Security, signed
in Moscow on October 30, 1943, which recognized the right and
responsibility of China to participate jointly with the other great
powers in the prosecution of the war, the organization of the peace,
and the establishment of machinery for postwar international
cooperation.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The Moscow Declaration provided the juridical
rationalization subsequently used to justify continued financial,
material and military support, to the Chiang Kai-shek regime.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Marshall&#8217;s attempt to mediate the dispute</h4>
<p class="fst">With the end of the war, both sides invited the US
government to mediate the armed conflict which had erupted into
full-scale civil war. In December, 1945, Truman designated General
George C. Marshall as his personal representative to mediate the
dispute.</p>

<p>The United States urged Chiang Kai-shek to &#8220;democratize&#8221; his regime
and to broaden the base of the National government in order to include
representatives of various &#8220;democratic&#8221; opposition groups. Washington
favored participation of the CCP in such a &#8220;reformed&#8221; government. This
policy was based on the conviction that the Red Army could not be
eliminatedby military means. In his later testimony before a joint
session of the House and Senate committees on foreign affairs, February
20, 1948, Marshall observed:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Considering the military aspects of the problem it
was clear from VJ Day in 1945 that the Chinese government was
confronted by a military situation which made it, in the opinion of
virtually every American authority, impossible to conquer the Communist
armies by force.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The alternative to a mediated political settlement in
Marshall&#8217;s opinion would be a massive intervention by the armed forces
of the United States in which the US &#8220;would have to be prepared
virtually to take over the Chinese government and administer its
economic, military and governmental affairs.&#8221; This was excluded. For,
as Lyman P. Van Slyke observes in his Stanford University Press edition
of <strong>The China White Paper</strong>,</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Not only were America&#8217;s resources insufficient for
military intervention in [Marshall&#8217;s] opinion, but the American people
would not sanction such a course.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">This view was bolstered, not only by the attitude of the
American civilian population, but more importantly by that of the
American army. When the Truman administration sought to shift American
troops to Asia after the end of the war in Europe, there was a virtual
rebellion which took the form of a movement to &#8220;Bring the Boys Home,&#8221;
which received widespread support from an aroused citizenry in this
country. The time was not propitious for a massive American military
intervention in China.</p>
<p>Marshall arrived in China in January, 1946. The circumstances were
not auspicious. The United States had made commitments to the Chiang
regime beginning with the Moscow Declaration of 1943 and there was
burgeoning opposition to compromise by the rabid anti-communists in
Washington, among whom Chiang had his staunchest supporters. Van Slyke
writes,</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;By October 1944, when General Joseph W. Stilwell,
who favored a tough <em>quid pro quo</em> policy toward Chiang, was
recalled at the Generalissimo&#8217;s insistence, General Patrick J. Hurley
had already arrived in China. He expressed clearly the goals of
American policy: to keep China in the war, to support Chiang and the
National government, to persuade Chiang to undertake certain reforms,
and to promote the unity and democracy to which all Chinese parties
proclaimed their dedication. It is clear now that these goals were
irreconcilable, for if there was no possibility of withdrawing our
support from Chiang, there was no way of getting him to make changes he
did not choose to make. America&#8217;s role as mediator was compromised for
the same reason. But this was far from clear at the time, except to
those who knew the situation in China most intimately.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Marshall was confronted with two opposing views on how a
new &#8220;democratic&#8221; government was to be established. The CCP insisted
that a coalition of the various political parties determine the
conditions under which a National Assembly was to be convened and a
draft constitution adopted. While granting the National government a
substantial majority, they insisted upon certain safeguards in the form
of minority representation sufficient to veto any attempt on the part
of the majority to substantially alter the terms upon which agreement
was reached.</p>
<p>Chiang insisted that inasmuch as his Kuomintang government was the
only &#8220;legal&#8221; and recognized authority all other political parties
should enter the National government with the rights of minority
representation as defined by a new constitution adopted by a National
Assembly and by the legislative and executive organs created by it. He
remained adamantly opposed to granting the CCP minority veto power at
any stage of the process of establishing the &#8220;new&#8221; bourgeois-democratic
state.</p>
<p>Chiang&#8217;s position was publicly endorsed by Washington. In a
statement defining <em>United States Policy Toward China</em>,
December 15, 1945, Truman declared:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The United States and the other United Nations have
recognized the present National government of the Republic of China as
the only legal government in China. It is the proper instrument to
achieve the objective of a unified China.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">It was on this rock that all subsequent negotiations
foundered.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the extent of CCP representation in the post-civil-war
government was not the only question open for negotiations between the
warring sides, and in the last analysis, it was not the most important
question. It was overshadowed by the question of the fate of the Red
Army. Truman added in the same 1945 policy statement:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The United States is cognizant that the present
National government of China is a &#8216;one-party government&#8217; and believes
that peace, unity and democratic reform will be furthered if the basis
of this government is broadened to include other political elements in
the country. Hence, the United States strongly advocates that the
national conference of representatives of the major political elements
in the country agree upon arrangements which would give these elements
a fair and effective representation in the Chinese National government.
It is recognized that this would require modification of the one-party
&#8216;political tutelage&#8217; established as an interim arrangement in the
progress of the nation toward democracy by the father of the Chinese
Republic, Doctor Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;<em>The existence of autonomous armies such as that
of the Communist army is inconsistent with, and actually makes
impossible, political unity in China. With the institution of a broadly
based representative government, autonomous armies should be eliminated
as such and all armed forces in China integrated effectively into the
Chinese National Army</em>.&#8221; (Emphasis added.)</p>

<p class="fst">General Marshall&#8217;s primary assignment in China was to
preside over the liquidation of the Red Army and this he failed to do.
But the reason does not lie in political intransigence on Mao&#8217;s part
toward reorganization of the Communist forces in the interest of
forming a &#8220;new&#8221; state. Marshall&#8217;s failure is fundamentally to be
explained by Chiang&#8217;s terms for formation of the postwar government.
The Generalissimo insisted on unconditional surrender. His terms would
have been virtually suicidal for the Communists to accept.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Political Consultative Conference</h4>
<p class="fst">When Marshall arrived in China in January 1946, he was
gratified to find that considerable progress had apparently been made
toward the achievement of his objective. Under prodding from the
Americans, both sides had agreed to the convening of a &#8220;Political
Consultative Conference&#8221; [PCC] in Chungking to begin the process of
forming a unified national government. A truce had been declared and a
joint &#8220;Order for the Cessation of Hostilities,&#8221; had been issued on
January 10 in the name of Generalissmo Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Mao
Tse-tung. A number of basic documents were adopted by the PCC designed
to lay a foundation for the new state order. These included a <em>Resolution
on Government Organization</em> and a <em>Resolution on Military
Problems</em>. Examination of these two documents shows how far Mao was
willing to go toward the formation of a coalition government and also
the points on which Mao and Chiang ultimately could not reach agreement.</p>
<p>The <em>Resolution on Military Problems</em> is divided into four
sections &#8220;Section I&#8221; itemizes &#8220;fundamental principles for the creation
of a national army&#8221;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Point 1) The army belongs to the state. It is the
duty of the soldier to protect the country and love the people.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Point 3) The military system shall be reformed in
the light of the democratic institutions and actual conditions
prevailing at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Point 5) Military education shall be conducted in
the light of the foregoing principles, and shall forever be dissociated
from party affiliation and personal allegiance.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">&#8220;Section II&#8221; sets forth the &#8220;fundamental principles for
the reorganization of the army.&#8221; &#8220;Point 1&#8221; provides: &#8220;Separation of
army and party.&#8221; &#8220;Subsection A&#8221; under &#8220;Point 1&#8221; states, &#8220;All political
parties shall be forbidden to carry on party activities, whether open
or secret, in the army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Section III, Point 5) A military Committee shall be established
within the Ministry of National Defense to be charged with the double
duty of drawing up schemes for the creation of a national army and of
seeing to it that the schemes are faithfully carried out. Members of
the committee shall be drawn from various circles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Section IV&#8221; covers the &#8220;practical methods for the reorganization of
the army.&#8221; Under</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Point 1) The three-man military commission shall
proceed according to schedule and agree upon practical methods for the
reorganization of the Communist troops at an early date. The
reorganization must be completed as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Point 2) The Government troops should be
reorganized, according to the plan laid down by the Ministry of War,
into ninety (90) divisions. The reorganization should be completed
within six (6) months.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Point 3) When the reorganizations envisaged in
paragraphs 1 and 2 have been completed, all troops of the country
should be again reorganized into fifty (50) or sixty (60) divisions.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And in this way would be created the &#8220;new&#8221; democratic
army of the &#8220;new&#8221; democratic Republic of China.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Resolution on Government Organization&#8221; provides that,</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;1) Pending the convocation of the National Assembly,
the Kuomintang, as a preliminary measure preparatory to the actual
inauguration of constitutionalism, will revise the Organic Law of the
National government in order to expand the State Council.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">It was around the question of the composition of this
&#8220;State Council&#8221; that an irreconcilable dispute subsequently occurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Point 1&#8221; under &#8220;Section I&#8221; reads:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There will be forty (40) State Councillors, of whom
the Presidents of the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination,
and Control Yuan will be <em>ex-officio</em> members.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Point 3) <em>The State Council is the supreme organ
of the Government in charge of national affairs</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Point 6) General resolutions before the State
Council are to be passed by a majority vote of the State Councillors
present. <em>If a resolution before the State Council should involve
changes in administrative policy, it must be passed by a two-thirds
vote of the State Councillors present.</em> Whether a given resolution
involves changes in administrative policy or not is to be decided by a
majority vote of the State Councillors present.&#8221; (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Point C) Half of the State Councillors will be
Kuomintang members and the other half will be members of other
political parties and prominent social leaders. <em>The exact number
of members of other political parties and prominent social leaders who
are to serve as State Councillors will form the subject of separate
discussions</em>.&#8221; (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="fst">The <em>Resolution on Military Problems</em> was the
first to be implemented. An executive &#8220;Committee of Three&#8221; was
established to supervise the cease-fire and to begin the process of
&#8220;Military Reorganization and Integration of Communist Forces into
National Army.&#8221; The committee was composed of a representative of each
of the three parties underwriting the agreement: General Chan Chih
Chun, representing the National government; General Chou En-lai,
representing the CCP and General George C. Marshall, acting as chairman
and listed as &#8220;advisor,&#8221; representing the United States. The process of
&#8220;integration&#8221; was to encompass a period of eighteen (18) months. At the
end of this period it was envisaged that all troops would be under the
command of the Minister of War to be designated after the National
Assembly had established a new government.</p>
<p>The agreement to establish an &#8220;Executive Headquarters&#8221; to be
administered by the Committee of Three was signed by Chan Chun and Chou
En-lai on January 10, 1946. But trouble broke out almost immediately.
Manchuria had been invaded by the Soviet Union after it had declared
war on Japan in August 1945. To secure the territory for the National
government, the United States placed at the disposal of Chiang the
planes, ships and personnel to transport his armies to Manchuria. Red
Army units in the area also converged on the territory. An open clash
was inevitable.</p>
<p>Both sides had agreed to stay away from those areas occupied by
Soviet troops. But who was to exercise control in the remainder of the
territory? Soon charges and countercharges were hurled by each side
that the other was guilty of violating the terms of the cease-fire. The
Executive Headquarters of the Committee of Three was paralyzed since
the agreement provided that all of its decisions were to be by
unanimous consent.</p>

<p>Chiang demanded that the provision for unanimous decision be amended
to provide for majority rule. The Americans were all for it but the CCP
balked. In June 1946 the Generalissimo issued an ultimatum declaring a
15-day truce in the fighting in Manchuria and demanding that the Red
Army withdraw within that period or suffer the consequences. The
ultimatum was condemned by the CCP as a violation of the January
cease-fire agreement and contrary to the spirit of the PCC resolutions.
At this Chiang launched a general offensive against the major forces of
the Red Army concentrated in Northern China.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cold war and a turn in China</h4>
<p class="fst">Up to this point there had been no reason for a rift
between Mao and Stalin. Mao had faithfully adhered to Stalin&#8217;s
coalition line. But the events following the convening of the PCC in
January 1946, marked a definite shift in China toward increasing
friction, then open hostilities and later, resumption of full-scale
civil war. It was this turn of events, I believe, which in retrospect
led some to the conclusion that a &#8220;break&#8221; had occurred between Mao and
Stalin sometime in the period 1946-47.</p>
<p>The turn in China was in large part a reflection of the change in
the international situation. As has already been noted, the wartime
coalition between the imperialists and Stalin came apart with the end
of the war. The break was heralded by increasing friction and was
publicly proclaimed in Winston Churchill&#8217;s famous &#8220;iron curtain&#8221; speech
in Fulton, Missouri, March 5, 1946&#8212;the opening salvo of the cold war.</p>
<p>Churchill&#8217;s speech created a sensation. It was obvious that the
time, place and setting of the speech was arranged in collaboration
with Truman. In China, the turn toward cold war politics along with
increased US military aid hardened Chiang Kai-shek&#8217;s position that the
CCP enter the National government on his terms or not at all. Failing a
&#8220;negotiated&#8221; agreement which would lead the CCP into a suicidal trap
Chiang was convinced that Washington would have no alternative but to
support his preferred course of mounting an all-out military assault
and smashing the Red Army as a prelude to &#8220;national unity.&#8221; Yet, the
coalition charade continued until the end of the year.</p>
<p>It took the form of a dispute over the number of representatives to
be allotted the CCP on the State Council which was to convene the
National Assembly. Of the forty State Councillors fixed by the PCC, 50
per cent, or twenty councillors were allotted to the Kuomintang. Of the
balance, the PCC <em>Resolution on Government Organization</em>
provided that the &#8220;exact number&#8221; to be allotted to other political
parties would &#8220;form the subject of separate discussions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chiang proposed that the CCP be allotted eight seats and that its
front organization, the Democratic League, would get four, or a total
of twelve. This number was just short of the one-third required to
block any &#8220;changes in administrative policy&#8221; under the State Council
setup. The CCP rejected this proposal. On September 21, 1946, Chou
En-lai wrote General Marshall:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If the Kuomintang would agree to appropriate
fourteen seats of the State Council to the Chinese Communist Party and
the Democratic League, thus definitely ensuring a one-third vote to
safeguard the PCC common program from being infringed upon, the whole
issue of the State Council can be settled almost overnight.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Under prodding from General Marshall the Generalissimo
was constrained to offer a &#8220;compromise.&#8221; On October 2, 1946, he wrote
Marshall:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Chinese Communist Party has been incessantly
urging the reorganization of the National government. This hinges on
the distribution of the membership of the State Council. The government
originally agreed that the Chinese Communist Party be allocated eight
seats and the Democratic League, four, with a total of twelve. The
Chinese Communist Party, on the other hand, requested ten for
themselves and four for the Democratic League with a total of fourteen.
Now the government makes a fresh concession by taking the mean and
offering one seat for the independents to be recommended by the Chinese
Communist Party and agreed upon by the government, so that, added to
the original twelve, it makes a total of thirteen seats.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">He couples this &#8220;concession&#8221; with the demand that the
CCP immediately produce their list of candidates for the State Council
and their list of delegates to the National Assembly <em>and</em> that
it proceed immediately to implement the PCC program for the
&#8220;reorganization&#8221; of the Red Army and its withdrawal to previously
&#8220;assigned areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thirteen seats was still short of the one-third &#8220;safeguard.&#8221; The
&#8220;compromise&#8221; proposal was rejected in a letter from Chou En-lai,
October 9, 1946, to Marshall, in which the demand for fourteen seats
&#8220;to ensure that the Peaceful Reconstruction Program would not be
revised unilaterally.&#8221; Back and forth, the controversy raged. Chiang
Kai-shek refused to be budged.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The US withdraws</h4>
<p class="fst">While this exercise in parliamentary bickering
continued, the real battles were being waged by the opposing armies in
the field. Temporary military successes bolstered Chiang&#8217;s conviction
that a military victory was in the cards. Brushing aside the proposals
in the October 9 letter from Chou which set forth the terms on which
the CCP would participate in the forthcoming National Assembly, Chiang
proceeded full-speed ahead to convene the National Assembly, November
15, 1946. This body, in the absence of the CCP, adopted a &#8220;democratic&#8221;
constitution and proceeded to form a &#8220;new&#8221; bourgeois democratic state
with all of the parliamentary trappings attendant thereon. The split
became definitive. The CCP was frozen out. The question of state power
in China could be resolved only by force of arms.</p>

<p>General Marshall took his departure with a parting shot at Chiang on
January 7, 1947, exactly one year from the day he arrived. In a
&#8220;personal statement&#8221; Marshall observed:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I think the most important factors involved in the
recent breakdown of negotiations are these: On the side of the National
government, which is in effect the Kuomintang, there is a dominant
group of reactionaries who have been opposed, in my opinion, to almost
every effort I have made to influence the formation of a coalition
government. This has usually been under the cover of political or party
action, but since the party was the government, this action, though
subtle or indirect, has been devastating in its effect. They were quite
frank in publicly stating their belief that cooperation by the Chinese
Communist Party in the government was inconceivable and that only a
policy of force could definitely settle the issue. This group includes
military as well as political leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Marshall returned to the United States to become
Secretary of State. His mission, which sought to resolve the state of
dual power by persuading the CCP to liquidate the Red Army contingent
upon the establishment of a coalition government with Chiang Kai-shek
failed because of Kuomintang intransigence.</p>
<p>On January 29, 1947, the US Department of State issued a press
release which read:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The United States government has decided to
terminate its connection with the Committee of Three which was
established in Chungking for the purpose of terminating hostilities in
China and of which General Marshall was chairman. The United States
government also has decided to terminate its connection with Executive
Headquarters which was established in Peiping by the Committee of Three
for the purpose of supervising, in the field, the execution of the
agreements for the cessation of hostilities and the demobilization and
reorganization of the Armed Forces in China.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">On its part, the CCP continued to press its demand for a
coalition government, but this time excluding Chiang Kai-shek and the
Kuomintang &#8220;reactionaries.&#8221; (An editorial broadcast by the North Shensi
Radio as late as May 24, 1948, called for the &#8220;swift convening of a new
political consultation conference by all liberals, democrats and
independent groups and organizations and all social luminaries to
discuss and approve the calling of a People&#8217;s Congress to establish a
Democratic Coalition government.&#8221;)<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Communist Party chooses to fight</h4>
<p class="fst">Meanwhile the cold war continued to heat up. On March
12, 1947, the White House called a joint session of Congress to hear
Truman request emergency authority to aid Britain against a new upsurge
of the Greek revolution. In this speech Truman laid down what has since
become known as the &#8220;Truman Doctrine&#8221;: Washington&#8217;s manifest destiny to
&#8220;defend&#8221; the &#8220;Free World&#8221; against &#8220;Communist aggression.&#8221; It was a
virtual threat of war against the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>This was followed on June 5 by a speech at Harvard by General
Marshall outlining a plan for the rehabilitation and stabilization of
capitalism in Europe. The details were worked out at a number of
conferences and the &#8220;Marshall Plan&#8221; was adopted by Congress in November.</p>
<p>These developments threw the Kremlin into a panic. It seemed that
once again the question of world war was placed high on the agenda. The
spurious &#8220;coalition&#8221; governments artificially imposed on the occupied
countries of Eastern Europe were summarily jettisoned and replaced by
&#8220;People&#8217;s Democracies&#8221; headed by the various Communist parties. An
international center was established in Belgrade designated as the
Communist Information Bureau, or Cominform. As its official organ, the
Cominform published a paper with the mouth-filling title: <em>For a
Lasting Peace&#8212;For a People&#8217;s Democracy</em>. In China, Mao hailed
these developments as a turning point in the struggle. In a speech to
the central committee of the CCP, December 25, 1947, on the <em>Present
Situation and Our Tasks</em>, he declared</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The revolutionary war of the Chinese people has now
reached a turning point.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">After commenting on the continued advances of the Red
Army in the civil war Mao observed</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The various new democratic countries of Europe are
consolidating themselves internally and uniting with one another. The
anti-imperialist forces of the people of various European capitalist
countries, especially in France and Italy, are growing. Within the
United States the people&#8217;s democratic forces are daily growing.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">(The latter refers to the movement by the American CP to
organize the Progressive Party to run Henry Wallace for president in
1948.) And most important of all:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Communist parties of nine European countries
have organized an information bureau and published a summons to battle,
calling on the people of the whole world to arise in opposition to the
imperialists plans of enslavement.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">While Mao is so given to hyperbole that he cannot
refrain from exaggeration, the essence of the matter was that a
critical division between the Soviet bloc and its imperialist
antagonists had developed.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances Stalin could only view with jaundiced eye
the prospect of a Nationalist victory in the Chinese civil war or even
a coalition regime in which the CCP was stripped of its armed forces to
become hostage to a puppet of American imperialism. Stalin was prepared
to go to considerable lengths to avoid the danger of a war on two
fronts inherent in the control of China by a hostile regime. In the
period from June 1946 to the definitive split in China in January 1947
and after, there was no valid reason, either from a political or
military view, for a &#8220;break&#8221; between Stalin and Mao. On the contrary,
the interests of the Soviet Union required a friendly ally on its
eastern frontier.</p>
<p>Given the choice of unconditional surrender or fight, the CCP
elected to fight. Once the war erupted in earnest, the inner decay of
the Chiang regime was quickly revealed. Documents in <strong>The China
White Paper</strong> offer eloquent testimony: On January 12, 1948:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Observers report no improvement in the morale of the
Nationalist forces, now at a dangerously low ebb. Field Commanders and
troops are unwilling to fight, except as a last resort, and large-scale
defection of combat elements confronted with battle can be expected to
continue.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">On November 8, 1948:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Within the past few weeks, the government&#8217;s military
power and economic position have so deteriorated that we seriously
question its ability to survive for long. There is just no will to
fight in Nationalist government armies and in high official circles
there is only befuddlement.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">From the same dispatch:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Only a few days before Mukden fell, the government
had five well-equipped, supplied and trained armies in the Manchurian
field, the most formidable striking force at its command, and within a
few days these armies were lost. They were lost not from battle
casualties, but from defection, although among their commanders were
numbered officers long associated with the Gimo [Generalissimo], and in
whose loyalty he trusted implicitly. The troops at Hsuchou are far
inferior to the Mukden garrison, and their commanders are already
resigned to defeat. There is no reason to believe in their will or
ability to resist an offensive. And when they are gone, Nanking has no
defense worthy of the name.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">And again:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There appears no reason to believe that the Gimo
has, or will consider, a negotiated peace with the Communists, even
should they agree to deal with him. This intransigence will prolong the
conflict as long as there are any who will stand by him. It remains to
be seen how many of his followers will remain when the news of Mukden
becomes generally known. Their members will be appreciably less when
the assault on Hsuchou begins. Whether he will have enough of a
following to attempt a defense of Nanking is problematical, even
doubtful, but it seems clear that once he has left Nanking in flight,
he will never again be a really effective political force in this
country.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Chiang&#8217;s armies melted away before the advance of the
Red Army so that at the end some of the larger urban centers, including
the largest city in China, Shanghai, fell without a shot.
Unfortunately, because of the CCP policy to restrain the city workers
from rising in solidarity with the approaching Red Armies, Chiang was
able to evacuate the remainder of his armed forces to Formosa where he
quelled an incipient rebellion and established himself as ruler of
Taiwan.</p>
<p class="c">* * *</p>
<p class="fst">The theoretical possibility of a Stalinist party taking
state power, even with its class collaborationist program and practice,
was not ruled out by Trotsky. In the <strong>Transitional Program</strong>,
adopted by the founding conference of the Fourth International in 1938,
Trotsky observed that</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... one cannot categorically deny in advance the
theoretical possibility that, under the influence of completely
exceptional circumstances (war, defeat, financial crash, mass
revolutionary pressure, etc.) the petty-bourgeois parties, including
the Stalinists may go further than they themselves wish along the road
to a break with the bourgeoisie.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">That, it seems clear to me, is what occurred in China in
the period of June 1946 to October 1949. Capitalism was toppled in
China in spite of Mao&#8217;s program and policies, not because of them..
Even a few months before taking state power, Mao held out the
perspective of indefinite coexistence with capitalism. &#8220;Our current
policy is to control capitalism, not abolish it,&#8221; he declared in July,
1949.</p>

<p>If there was a bourgeois-democratic stage in the third Chinese
revolution it can be said to have begun with the abolition of the
period of &#8220;political tutelage&#8221; and the convening of the National
Assembly on November 15, 1946. But, in line with the theory of
permanent revolution, the National Assembly failed&#8212;it did not even
try&#8212;to carry through the democratic tasks of the bourgeois-democratic
revolution. The carrying through of these tasks was undertaken by the
regime established by the Chinese Communist Party through a new
&#8220;Political Consultative Conference&#8221; of September 29, 1949&#8212;the regime
characterized as the &#8220;People&#8217;s Democratic State.&#8221;</p>
<p>This required no break with the Kremlin; the evidence is
overwhelming that Mao considered the conquest of state power by the Red
Army and the establishment of a &#8220;People&#8217;s Republic&#8221; a consequence of
the &#8220;teachings of Stalin&#8221; and, in the given international situation, in
conformity with the interests of the Soviet bureaucracy.</p>
