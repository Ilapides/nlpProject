<p class="fst">THE leaders of American labor are in a blue funk.
Something has gone awry. The time is out of joint. For years now they
have preached and practiced the virtues of labor-management
cooperation; they extolled the partnership of labor and capital which,
they affirmed, was the capstone of the American way-of-life.</p>
<p>A few years ago, David J. McDonald, president of the United Steel
Workers, literally transported by the vision of capital and labor
marching arm-in-arm ever onward and upward scaling new heights of
prosperity and well-being, entered into a pact of &#8220;mutual trusteeship&#8221;
with Benjamin Fairless, former head of United States Steel Corporation.</p>
<p>It was arm-around-the-shoulder &#8220;Dave&#8221; and &#8220;Ben&#8221; in those days. To
the steel workers, the mutual trusteeship pact became known as the
&#8220;hearts and flowers&#8221; clause. &#8220;Dave&#8221; and &#8220;Ben&#8221; toured the steel plants
breaking bread with humble stewards, committeemen, plant foremen,
superintendents and local union officials, spreading the message of
sweetness and light. What nostalgia those halcyon days must evoke in
McDonald today with its nightmare reality of class war!</p>

<p>That class war is the reality today is admitted by the most ardent
exponents of labor-management cooperation. But it is a most peculiar
kind of war. The employers and their government have launched a savage
assault on the unions. Monopoly capital has mobilized all the class
forces at its command to beat the labor movement into submission. Yet
the union leaders cling tenaciously to the doctrine of class
collaboration.</p>
<p>According to the view expounded by the &#8220;labor statesmen&#8221; the United
States occupies a unique position in world society. While class
divisions, class antagonisms and class struggle may be the reality in
other lands and among other peoples, this country is presumed to be
immune to such affliction.</p>
<p>How then explain the class war against labor? Is it some temporary
aberration that has driven the capitalist class into committing so
blatant an act of folly? It would seem so judging by the explanation
given by Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers and
vice-president of the AFL-CIO, in a recent speech:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The National Association of Manufacturers and big
business,&#8221; Reuther contends, &#8220;are waging a class struggle in America,
precisely as Karl Marx wrote it would be waged. They are working
overtime to prove that Karl Marx was right.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">And, Reuther added, if the American labor movement
permitted itself to be sucked into responding in kind, &#8220;then we are
going to do really serious damage to America and the cause of freedom
in the whole world.&#8221; Under conditions of class war, right here in the
US, labor confronts the ineluctable alternatives: either fight or
retreat and capitulate. Which alternative does Reuther offer?</p>
<p>The &#8220;cause of human freedom in the whole world&#8221; is a noble and
worthy goal. But what of the cause of human freedom in these United
States now being threatened with crucifixion by the war of capital
against labor? Karl Marx and all the great revolutionary leaders who
followed him taught the workers a simple truth: the main enemy is the
capitalist class in your own country! There is much validity to what
Reuther says&#8212;the American capitalist class is certainly &#8220;working
overtime to prove that Karl Marx was right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Words can scarcely be found to describe the dismay of the labor
bureaucrats at this turn of events. Grown fat and soft while baking in
the sunshine of &#8220;labor-management cooperation,&#8221; these summer soldiers
have no stomach for a fight. Confronted by the reality of class war
they flounder about in hopeless confusion. Appalled at the bankruptcy
of a policy which has led the labor movement into a dead end, fearful
of engaging the enemy in open struggle, they can only offer&#8212;more of
the same.</p>
<p>Yet, exercising the prerogatives of &#8220;leadership,&#8221; and enjoying the
privileges and perquisites of office, they are obliged to explain to
their bewildered followers where and why they went wrong. If Marx was
wrong and Reuther and Meany right, how explain the fact of class war in
a country presumably free of class distinctions and immune to class
struggle? The &#8220;labor statesmen&#8221; are hard put to find a plausible
explanation, but they do try.<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">THE August 29 <strong>AFL-CIO News</strong> devotes a
long article to the problem, printed under a five column banner head
reading: &#8220;Class War Being Forced on US Workers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If,&#8221; the article begins, &#8220;there is one word which
characterizes the plight of the American worker during the 12-month
span from Labor Day 1958 to Labor Day 1959, it is &#8216;uncertainty.&#8217;</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;Labor-management tensions, which have always varied
in their intensity, now seem to be reaching a critical point where the
American worker is being pushed into a class war not of his making, not
of his choice.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;Determined and powerful forces have singled out the
working man and his trade union as a class. If they are successful, the
hard-won security which the workingman hoped was in his grasp, the
ability to provide his family with a few of the better things of life,
may be at an end.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;The knowing American worker sees his security
threatened on the economic front, the legislative front, the political
front and at the bargaining table.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Who are these &#8220;determined and powerful forces&#8221;
threatening the American worker on every front? The article explains:
&#8220;One year ago these forces were noisy but their influence was limited.
Today, almost as if puppets on string from an invisible hand, men of
power and wealth have joined this band of extremists to demand that
labor be weakened, its effectiveness undermined.&#8221;</p>
<p>There you have it! The source of the trouble is a &#8220;band of
extremists&#8221; who are manipulating &#8220;men of power and wealth&#8221; like puppets
on a string. The summer issue of the AFL-CIO <strong>Industrial Union
Department Digest</strong> is more explicit. An article entitled: <em>The
Anti-Labor War</em>, affirms that, &#8220;Today&#8217;s resurgent right-wing
intellectuals have declared a kind of class war.&#8221; It is these
right-wing intellectuals who &#8220;have declared the class war and laid down
its theoretical framework,&#8221; and &#8220;our business leaders have not lagged
in putting the theories to the test.&#8221;</p>

<p>How can anyone make head or tail out of this nonsense? If it means
anything at all it suggests that the real rulers of this country, the
men of wealth and power, are being deceived into putting to the test
the patently un-American class-war theories of a bunch of extremist
crackpots instead of hewing to the genuine American class collaboration
theories of our &#8220;labor statesmen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does Eisenhower take to the air to demand that Congress adopt the
anti-labor Landrum-Griffin &#8220;killer&#8221; bill? Obviously he was being misled&#8212;as we are assured by no less an authority than Louis Hollander, a
high ranking official of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers union.</p>
<p>The August 15 issue of the ACW newspaper, <strong>The Advance</strong>,
publishes a speech by Hollander made to some &#8220;12,000 joint board
delegates and local union officers on August 11 shortly after he
returned from Washington where he conferred with AFL-CIO leaders on
labor legislation.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is,&#8221; opined Hollander, &#8220;a cause for sorrow that a
national war hero of our country, twice elected President, should have
been so deliberately misled by evil men as to accept at face value
their false and misleading statements and then carry this message to
the people, all the time believing and trusting sincerely in those
double-dealers he has been persuaded to take into his confidence as
advisors.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The question that literally leaps to the fore is: Who is
misleading whom? Eisenhower, the National Association of Manufacturers,
the men of wealth and power, the big business interests and their
flunkies in government remain true to their class. When their class
interests are served thereby, they have no compunction about embracing
the so-called &#8220;theories&#8221; of the labor bureaucrats and utilizing their
services to bamboozle the workers. If the union leaders had
one-hundredth the class integrity, class solidarity, class loyalty, of
the exploiting class, labor would not now be buffeted from pillar to
post in demoralized confusion before the blows of capitalist reaction.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">HISTORY subjects all social theories to the acid test of
events. Judging by this test, what has been the result of the theory of
class collaboration as applied in practice by the labor leaders? The
above cited article from the <strong>AFL-CIO News</strong> reviews the
events of the past year.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Do you recall last Labor Day?&#8221; the writer
nostalgically asks his readers. &#8220;The critical 1958 congressional
elections were only two months away. In six states the so-called
right-to-work law was on the ballot.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;Organized labor carried its message to the people.
The people responded. Not only did they elect a Congress overwhelmingly
committed to the cause of trade unionism but they crushed the &#8216;work&#8217;
law in five out of six states.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The 1958 election result was touted as a resounding
victory for labor; an irrefutable confirmation of the theory of class
collaboration! The new Congress had the largest Democratic majority
since 1938. The union leaders boasted that 221 incorruptible &#8220;friends
of labor&#8221; had been elected to the House of Representatives alone. There
was great rejoicing and no little self-congratulation in the ranks of
the &#8220;labor statesmen.&#8221; That was less than one short year ago.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Unionists had every right,&#8221; says the <strong>AFL-CIO
News</strong> article, &#8220;to expect that this victory at the polls would
be translated into a legislative victory. <em>It was one of the
greatest</em> disillusion-merits of <em>modern history</em>.&#8221; (Our
emphasis)</p>
<p class="fst">And what is the lesson to be drawn from this experience?
&#8220;If the critical period from Labor Day 1958 to Labor Day 1959 has
taught trade unionists anything,&#8221; the article concludes, &#8220;it is that
their unions will remain strong and free as long as they fight for
them.&#8221; But fight how? With what weapons? Against whom? Of this there is
no hint. On the contrary, the labor leaders have made it abundantly
clear that they have no intention of altering the course which has led,
irrevocably, to &#8220;the greatest disillusionment of modern history.&#8221;</p>

<p>Incorrigibly committed to the preservation of the &#8220;free enterprise&#8221;
system, the union leaders refuse to believe that the responsible &#8220;men
of wealth and power&#8221; with whom they had so blissfully cohabited have
turned against them. The elaborate structure of labor-management
cooperation, so painfully constructed over the years, was erected on
the cornerstone of their most cherished conviction: the identity of
interest between capital and labor.</p>
<p>This doctrine was primary and fundamental to their entire view of
the world they lived in. True, there were recognized differences,
friction often developed, occasional spats, and more than one sham
battle. But these were considered in the nature of family quarrels,
subordinate to the cementing principle which bound them together.</p>
<p>The outlook of the present union officialdom has been conditioned by
some 20 years of mutually beneficial relations with the captains of
American industry. These were years of unprecedented prosperity and
expansion for American monopoly capitalism. Forgotten were the savage
union repressions of the twenties and the fierce class battles of the
early thirties which gave rise to the modern labor movement. The men of
wealth and power had presumably mellowed. The unions became an accepted
institution of American life.</p>
<p>True, there always remained some recalcitrant employers who never
became reconciled to the new state of affairs and the benighted
Dixiecrat South. But these were looked upon as the lunatic fringe of
the capitalist class. It is apparently this &#8220;band of extremists&#8221; to
whom the labor leaders now refer as the ringleaders of the class war.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">THE ninth annual meeting of the Industrial Relations
Research Association, held in Cleveland, Dec. 28-29, 1956, dealt with
the changes that had occurred in the American labor movement over the
past 20 years. George W. Brooks of the International Brotherhood of
Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill Workers union, submitted a paper to the
meeting entitled: <em>Observations on the Changing Nature of American
Unions</em>. It begins:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The most important factor affecting labor unions is
the attitude of the employer. This is particularly true in the United
States, where workingmen depend exclusively upon the union (among forms
of labor organization) for the articulation and achievement of their
aspirations. Here, to a far greater degree than elsewhere, the employer
is the source of all good things.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;This sound working rule has acquired during the past
20 years a firm ideological base, a virtually complete acceptance of
that set of beliefs which may be roughly described as &#8216;capitalism.&#8217;
This ideological structure is buttressed by a specific faith in the
capacities of American management, shared alike by trade union members
and trade union leaders.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;It must not be supposed,&#8221; adds Brooks, &#8220;that the
trade union leader has always led his members into these beliefs,
although this has no doubt happened in some cases.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">This change in the attitude of the employers, according
to Brooks, was reciprocated by a corresponding change in the attitude
of the union leaders.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Some observers,&#8221; he remarks, &#8220;have professed
inability to understand why, in the light of the attitudes of unions a
quarter of a century ago, the union representative was so ready to walk
through the open door. The question reflects a misunderstanding of what
was happening a quarter of a century ago, and not of what is happening
now. Before the passage of the Wagner Act, unions were traditionally
anti-employer. But the earlier ideologies were not theirs by choice.
They were forced upon the unions by systematic employer anti-unionism
...</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;When anti-unionism was abandoned in the forties and
fifties by significant segments of American industry, a new world was
created for the unions. For it now turned out that the imperative
requirements of the union&#8212;the regular flow of new members and dues&#8212;could be underwritten by the employer with considerably more
reliability than was possible under earlier arrangements. Unions were
in many cases relieved, almost suddenly, of work that used to occupy 90
percent of their energies. Even the task of organizing was simplified.
For in our expanding economy, most of the expansion is in the form of
new plants by established firms.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;The outstanding changes for the union, in its own
mind,&#8221; remarks Brooks in summarizing this section of his paper, &#8220;is its
success. This colors every action and attitude of the leadership. Labor
leaders see their achievements mirrored in the new attitudes of
management. They have every reason to believe that the trends of the
last 20 years are all to the good, and that their systematic
encouragement will lead to more good.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Needless to say, the labor leaders have done everything
they could to further the &#8220;systematic encouragement&#8221; of the partnership
between the union bureaucrats and corporate management. In an article
published in the June issue of Harpers magazine, Bernard D. Nossiter,
labor writer for the <strong>Washington Post and Times Herald</strong>,
describes how the partnership has functioned.</p>
<p>The partnership pattern, says Nossiter, &#8220;varies greatly from one
industry to another. Even where it is the most advanced, the liaison
between the supposedly rival institutions is far from solid. It is more
often a furtive and uneasy alliance between the top bureaucrats of the
unions and the corporations&#8212;an arrangement that neither party can
publicly admit and that most of the participants insist is just gossip.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the body of evidence recently assembled, Nossiter maintains
that: &#8220;The tacit collaboration between management and union officers
has been thriving all through the period of postwar prosperity.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Like any couple,&#8221; he points out, &#8220;the corporate and
union partners have their spats. Moreover, the need to conceal their
illicit if pleasurable goings-on requires them periodically to denounce
each other. And, as in the most harmonious affairs, there is a master
and his mate. The company executives get the most money, as shown by a
glance at the relative incomes and capital gains of such pairs as Roger
Blough, chairman of United States Steel and David McDonald, president
of the United Steelworkers; or Jack L. Smead, president of Consolidated
Freightways, and James R. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters Union.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Because of past experience, Nossiter expressed his
skepticism about the current steel industry dispute. In his article,
written before the union was forced to strike, he says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The current goings-on in the steel industry would
seem to belie this analysis. The union and the companies have been
verbally belting each other with apparent enthusiasm as their wage
contract runs to an end on June 30. But appearances can be deceiving.
Economists can recall that the industry forced a strike in 1946 to pry
loose a price increase from OPA. Many suspect that the periodic
outbursts of industrial warfare are a cover under which the companies
only appear to resist wage increases. Then, after a comparatively brief
strike to work down the inventories steel customers have built up in
fear of a stoppage, the companies reluctantly settle for a substantial
increase in wages and fringe benefits. Finally, as John Kenneth
Galbraith, of Harvard, has pointed out, the companies use this
settlement as an excuse to boost prices enough to cover the wage
increase several times.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">This technique, he adds, &#8220;has become so well publicized
in Washington this year, however, that a new script may have been
written for the 1959 bargaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>The current dispute is being conducted along the lines of a &#8220;new
script&#8221; all right. But this time it is written in Wall Street and
Washington without the collaboration of McDonald.</p>
<p>In a chapter entitled: <em>How the Partnership Works</em>, Nossiter
explains how the &#8220;union captains perform different services for their
corporate colonels, depending on the degree of concentration in the
industry. However,&#8221; he affirms,</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... they all work with each other, regardless of
whether the industry is concentrated or competitive. The trucking
industry has rushed to defend both Beck and Hoffa. In coal, the
incorruptible Lewis will be memorialized by both miners and operators.
New York&#8217;s garment manufacturers have learned to love David Dubinsky,
president of the Ladies Garment Workers Union; on the Pacific Coast,
Harry Bridges has no bigger booster than the Pacific Maritime
Association unless it is the ILWU stevedores;&#8221; etc., etc.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;Some observers,&#8221; concludes Nossiter, &#8220;see in this
harmony a new age of enlightenment. The reality is a little less
appealing. These union leaders, in varying degrees, perform important
services for their industry&#8217;s employers. They discipline dissidents and
prevent wildcat strikes. In expanding industries, they fight for wage
gains which enable the industry to obtain a more than off-setting
increase in prices. In competitive industries like trucking and ladies
garments, they make it harder for new firms to start up and compete
with established companies. In big industries, the rising wage-price
structure makes the capital requirements for potential new firms almost
prohibitive. In many industries, union leaders argue vigorously for
technological change, persuading the membership to accept the machines
that will put their less fortunate colleagues out of work.&#8221;<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">NOSSITER&#8217;S thesis is that &#8220;Big Business&#8221; and &#8220;Big Labor&#8221;
have entered into collusion to mulct the public by restricting
production and raising prices. In exchange the union leaders are given
concessions with which to placate their membership and buy their
acquiescence. For these concessions the union bureaucrats perform many
useful services for the corporations. His remedy is to call upon the
government to protect the public from this &#8220;unholy alliance&#8221; by
exercising some form of control over wages and prices in what is
delicately referred to as &#8220;concentrated industries,&#8221; and by extension
to economic planning.</p>
<p>From his study of the tendency in American capitalism toward
increased monopolization, Nossiter concludes that &#8220;the march toward
rationalization&#8212;an industrial structure with fewer corporations and
considerable private planning&#8212;appears unlikely to be halted. All over
the globe,&#8221; he observes, &#8220;men are planning their material arrangements
to overcome the obsolete problem of material want.&#8221; In economically
backward countries, in the more advanced capitalist countries of
Europe, in what he calls the &#8220;Communist nations,&#8221; men &#8220;have turned from
reliance on impersonal market forces to some conscious and public
planning of investment, prices and wages.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for this country:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;More of this goes on in the United States than is
generally understood. Tax laws play a potent part in investment
decisions. The planning of a General Motors, United States Steel, or a
Standard Oil (New Jersey) plays a decisive part in the Nation&#8217;s
economy. The question now posed is whether these private corporations
will be allowed to continue making decisions of vast public consequence
without some kind of informed public surveillance.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Nossiter is not too optimistic about the ability of
government to regulate and control the monopolies in the interest of
&#8220;the public.&#8221; All past attempts to do so have failed. &#8220;The critics,&#8221; he
remarks, &#8220;point to the long history of Federal regulation. They note
that in time, the &#8216;independent&#8217; commissions become willing vassals of
the industry they are regulating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the lessons of history and experience speak against it,
Nossiter suggests that a new beginning be made in the form of
&#8220;non-coercive&#8221; restraint through public pressure. One of the foremost
proponents of this type of intervention, the liberal bourgeois
economist John Kenneth Galbraith, lays down &#8220;three principles&#8221; for this
type of intervention:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;(1) Limited: It should apply only to firms and
unions in concentrated industries which have a decisive share of the
market power.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;(2) Simple: Perhaps a government panel should
require these corporations and unions to justify in advance each
proposed price and wage increase. The panel would then make specific
recommendations in the light of agreed-upon national goals.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;(3) Conciliatory factfinding: At least at first we
might rely on panel findings to mobilize public opinion to serve as a
restraint on union and corporate managers. If this did not work, then
sanctions or penalties would be in order.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Several liberal Democrats in Congress have already
introduced bills embodying Galbraith&#8217;s &#8220;three principles.&#8221; Senator
Estes Kefauver, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust and
Monopoly, has introduced a bill to establish a Department of Consumers.
These steps are supported by a small group of liberal Congressional
Democrats and Republicans, some of whom have been demanding that
Eisenhower set up a &#8220;fact finding committee&#8221; to settle the steel
strike. &#8220;Some of these legislators,&#8221; remarks Nossiter, &#8220;may be longer
on intelligence than influence.&#8221; It is to this coterie of bourgeois
liberals that Nossiter attributes a &#8220;quiet revolution in economic
thought,&#8221; which has &#8220;three leading ideas&#8221; as follows:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;(1) Oligopoly, not competition, has become the
dominant mode of American economic life. In their search for profits,
oligopolists tend to restrain production and employment and raise
prices.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;(2) The traditional antagonism between unions and
management in oligopolistic or concentrated industries is disappearing.
Conscious and unconscious collusion takes its place, lifting wages for
some and prices (including stock prices) for others.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;(3) The public interest in economic affairs has long
been established in theory and practice. Business enjoys outright
subsidies like tariffs and tax gimmicks, and makes large sales to
government. Unions are also supported by government through complex
codes guaranteeing organizing and bargaining rights. Therefore it is no
real departure to insist on a public interest in the key wage and price
decisions.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">THERE is merit in the considerable factual evidence
adduced by Nossiter to support the charge of collusion between the
union bureaucrats and corporate management. But his conclusions are
totally false and the proposed remedy completely ineffectual. The basic
fallacy of the liberals of all persuasions is their view that
government is an impartial, independent and benign arbiter of the
social conflicts that arise in class society; that government stands
aloof, or should so stand, from the clash of economic interest between
the contending class forces unless and until the &#8220;public interest&#8221; is
involved. Government must then intervene, paternalistically at first,
as advisor and mediator, but with all of the coercion of state power if
need be to uphold the interest of the &#8220;public&#8221;; i.e. the whole people.</p>
<p>It is this view that afflicts the liberals with a peculiar form of
social and political astigmatism which enables them to assign equal
responsibility to capital and labor for the present state of affairs.
How can anyone, for example, familiar with the events of the past
decade, justify government intervention in the unions on the basis of
the argument that: &#8220;Unions are also supported by government through
complex codes guaranteeing organizing and bargaining rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>This statement may have had the appearance of validity under the
Wagner Act in the days of the &#8220;New Deal.&#8221; Closer examination, however,
discloses that the labor codes of that era performed the function of
(a) &#8220;guaranteeing&#8221; only those rights labor had won through its own
independent struggles, and (b) permitting the government to gain a grip
on the unions and open the process of destroying their independence.
But the result of government intervention since Taft-Hartley has left
no room whatever for any illusions. Government intervention plainly
revealed its true purpose&#8212;to virtually arrest the organization
expansion of the unions and to straitjacket their bargaining rights.
The recently enacted Landrum-Griffin-Kennedy so-called &#8220;labor reform&#8221;
law extends the punitive provisions of Taft-Hartley.</p>

<p>Thus, government intervention in union affairs, at least since 1946,
no longer even gives the appearance of being either impartial or
benign. While it is true that government regulation of industry has
been a farce, government intervention in the unions has served to
shackle labor, to undermine its independence, to weaken its capacity to
defend the workers standard of living, to circumscribe its ability to
expand, to strengthen the stranglehold of the monopolists on the
economic life of the country.</p>
<p>Far from acting as an impartial arbiter between capital and labor,
government has acted as a tool of big business, a creature of the
monopolists. How could it be otherwise? Those who exercise economic
control, those whose planning &#8220;plays a decisive part in the Nation&#8217;s
economy,&#8221; wield the nation&#8217;s political power. Sometimes they do it
directly, as through Eisenhower&#8217;s millionaire cabinets; sometimes
indirectly through some form of coalition between the labor lieutenants
of capitalism together with assorted varieties of liberals.</p>
<p>Where labor has its own political organizations, as in Europe, it
enters into coalition arrangements with the capitalists, often through
direct participation in the cabinets. In this country, the partnership
takes the form of a coalition within the framework of the Democratic
party. In periods of social crisis the labor &#8220;statesmen&#8221; are directly
drawn into the government apparatus as in the period of the economic
collapse under the New Deal and in the tripartite boards under the War
Deal. These periods terminated with the end of the war and the great
class battles of 1945-46.</p>
<p>The enactment of the Taft-Hartley law in 1947 signified the
beginning of the close of an era. Government &#8220;paternalism&#8221; toward labor
gave way to punitive restrictions and onerous regulations. The postwar
period of expansion and prosperity made it profitable for the
monopolists to continue the policy of labor-management cooperation, the
results of which have been amply described above. But the process of
increasing prices three-fold on the basis of granting a wage increase
cannot continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>The privileged position occupied by American capitalism in the
postwar world market is drawing to a close. American capitalism faces a
shrinking world market, a world in which the colonial peoples are in
open rebellion against imperialist domination, a world in which the
tremendous technological advances in the Soviet Union and growing
strength of the Soviet bloc together with the increased competition
from rehabilitated Germany and Japan has further narrowed the field for
American capitalist exploitation. The ominous future has been further
adumbrated by the recurrent pattern of recessions each one going deeper
than before.</p>
<p>There is no stability for American capitalism upon which rests the
entire structure of the world capitalist order. Under the
circumstances, monopoly capitalism seeks to assure class stability at
home by depriving the unions, the only mass organization of the
American workers, of the possibility of independent action.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">IN a series of notes on trade union problems, written by
Leon Trotsky before his assassination, the tendency of monopoly
capitalism to fuse with the state power and the conditions under which
the reformist labor bureaucracy was permitted to retain its privileges,
were brilliantly analyzed.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The intensification of class contradictions within
each country,&#8221; wrote Trotsky, &#8220;the intensification of antagonisms
between one country and another, produce a situation in which
imperialist capitalism can tolerate (i.e., up to a certain time) a
reformist bureaucracy only if the latter serves directly as a petty but
active stockholder in its imperialist enterprises, of its plans and
programs within the country as well as on the world arena. Social
reformism must become transformed into social-imperialism in order to
prolong its existence, but only prolong it and nothing more. Because
along this road there is no way out in general.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">There has been no more ardent supporter of State
Department foreign policy than the American labor bureaucracy. This has
not spared it the blows of reaction at home, for, as Trotsky points out:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Monopoly capitalism is less and less willing to
reconcile itself to the independence of the trade unions. It demands of
the reformist bureaucracy and the labor aristocracy who pick the crumbs
from its banquet table, that they become transformed into its political
police before the eyes of the working class. If that is not achieved,
the labor bureaucracy is driven away and replaced by the fascists.
Incidentally, all of the efforts of the labor aristocracy in the
service of imperialism cannot in the long run save them from
destruction.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The current antics of the American union bureaucrats
indicate that they have no intention of abandoning their policy of
class collaboration despite the savage employer-government anti-labor
offensive. They propose to adapt themselves to the
Landrum-Griffin-Kennedy measure just as they adapted themselves to
Taft-Hartley. They hope to ride out the storm and resume where they
left off with business as usual.</p>
<p>However, the union bureaucrats confront a serious dilemma. The
stability of the bureaucracy rests on its ability to extract some
concessions for services rendered. Failure to do so threatens
disaffection in the ranks and engenders opposition moods and movements.
Therefore, they must make a show of resistance.</p>
<p>A show of resistance by the union tops threatens to unleash a stormy
movement from below. A case in point is the militant challenge to the
leadership of Teamster Local 85 in San Francisco recently. Because
Hoffa has been made the target of reaction he has been compelled to
seek rank and file support by advocating militant union action and
loosening the bureaucratic grip over the drivers. Taking advantage of
the situation the drivers in Local 85 took command of a strike struggle
and in the face of the hostility of the leadership, the press and the
employers, won a significant victory. This is of enormous symptomatic
significance. Other examples can be cited, such as the independent
labor mobilization to defeat the Ohio Right-to-Work bill last year, etc.</p>
<p>Whether through capitulation or resistance, cracks and crevices will
be opened up in the bureaucratic crust for trade union militants to
begin the organization of a left wing opposition. A genuine left wing
formation will emblazon on its banner the Marxist sign of the class
struggle. For only by transforming the unions into revolutionary
instruments in the struggle for state power will American labor be able
to avoid the holocaust of imperialist war, depression and fascist
barbarism.</p>
