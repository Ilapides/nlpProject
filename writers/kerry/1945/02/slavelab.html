<p class="fst">As the war in Europe approaches a climax, the campaign for
additional instruments of labor repression is intensified. The
Roosevelt administration is using all the pressure tactics at it&rsquo;s
command to jam a slave labor law through Congress before the military
collapse of Germany. All the tricks of &ldquo;psychological warfare&rdquo;
are being employed to whip up sentiment for a National Service Act
and batter down the opposition. The brass hats are conducting an
all-out drive to regiment labor under control of a military caste.
They look upon the war as a heaven-sent opportunity to straitjacket
the unions and are fearful lest &ldquo;V-E Day&rdquo; arrives before
they can succeed in fastening the American working class in the
totalitarian fetters of forced labor.</p>

<p>Spearheaded by the brass hats, a number of administration
spokesmen have appeared before closed hearings of the Senate Military
Affairs Committee to urge the immediate enactment of the May-Bailey
labor conscription bill. This bill provides fines and imprisonment
for workers who leave their jobs &ldquo;without permission,&rdquo;
and who refuse to take jobs when directed by their draft boards to do
so. It places the entire male working population between the ages of
18-45 under full control of the Selective Service system. As
Selective Service is an auxiliary of the military service, the bill
would actually place labor under direct control of the brass hats.</p>

<p>Strong opposition has developed to placing civilian labor under
direct military control. A substantial section of the employers fear
that the concentration of too much power in the hands of a military
caste would threaten their prerogatives. This fear was voiced in an
editorial by David Lawrence in the <strong>United States News</strong> on Feb. 9.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;It is difficult to see,&rdquo; said Lawrence,
&ldquo;how the Congress, if it enacts the pending manpower bill, can
hesitate to remove all &rsquo;profit from any enterprise where there
is forced labor. If forced labor is to be construed as service to
one&rsquo;s country, let it be clearly for that purpose alone, and
then, logically, management and ownership must be conscripted, too.
It will be a surprise if the AFL and the CIO, who are opposed to the
&lsquo;forced labor&rsquo; bill, do not insist on such legislation to
cover management and ownership. There would be widespread sympathy
for such a proposal.&rdquo;</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Employer Objections</h4>

<p class="fst">The employer opposition exemplified by Lawrence does not object to
-the principle of compulsory labor for private profit. But they favor
the extension of the existing &ldquo;work-or-fight&rdquo; and
&ldquo;work-or-starve&rdquo; decrees, administered through the War
Manpower Commission and Selective Service, as the means for hog-tieing
labor. In essence their opposition boils down to the demand
that the WMC be granted statutory authority to enforce the executive
orders issued by Roosevelt chaining workers to their jobs at frozen
wages. These decrees have already imposed a &ldquo;limited&rdquo;
form of compulsory labor on a substantial section of the working
class. This attitude was summed up by Ira Mosher, head of the
National Association of Manufacturers in a letter to the <strong>N.Y.
Times</strong>.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The NAM program,&rdquo; wrote Mosher, &ldquo;requires
more effective functioning of the existing WMC machinery and
regulations. It requires adequate statutory authority for the WMC
respecting the establishment of employment ceilings in all
industries, the use of controlled referrals and compulsory releases.
It calls for immediate application of the work-or-fight principle,
within the present framework of the Selective Service authority and
machinery.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The brass hats are resisting any change in the May bill which
would deprive them of direct control over the administration of the
proposed slave labor act. Having already concentrated tremendous
power in their hands, they are reaching out for full control of the
economic and political life of the country. They hope to crush all
opposition to the imperialist aims of Wall Street&rsquo;s war under a
military dictatorship. They are prepared to use any means to
accomplish their purpose. Having been reduced to the argument that
the immediate enactment of the May bill is now necessary to &ldquo;boost
the morale&rdquo; of the soldiers, they deliberately set about
manufacturing &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; to support their spurious
contention.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&ldquo;Evidence&rdquo; on Order</h4>

<p class="fst">In the midst of the Senate hearings on the May bill, an editorial
appeared in the Paris edition of an army newspaper, <strong>The Stars and
Stripes</strong>, endorsing the May bill. According to one of its writers,
this &ldquo;marked the first time any service publication had taken
sides on an American political issue.&rdquo; The <strong>N.Y. Times</strong>
reported: &ldquo;Some members of the staff of the paper were so
incensed at the publication of the editorial that they proposed to
call a meeting tomorrow to protest the use of the soldiers&rsquo;
publication for political purposes. They contended that the paper
should be edited only for soldiers and not on behalf of any project
which might interest high-ranking officers of the War Department.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The editor of the publication admitted he was &ldquo;asked in
messages from a War Department officer and from Under Secretary of
War Robert P. Patterson whether <strong>Stars and Stripes</strong> had
commented on the May bill.&rdquo; &ldquo;The text of the editorial,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;had been cabled at Mr. Patterson&rsquo;s request to
Washington so it would be in his hands for Senate hearings on the
May-Bailey bill.&rdquo; In a footnote to this incident the <strong>N.Y.
Times</strong> reveals that: &ldquo;The editorial was written by the
editor, Lieut. Col. Arthur Goodfriend, formerly an advertising
writer, who received his promotion from major yesterday.&rdquo; This
is how Patterson got his &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; that the soldiers&rsquo;
are clamoring for the May bill and also how the &ldquo;editor&rdquo;
got his promotion.</p>

<p>This whole incident is typical of the fabricated evidence used to
support the demand for labor conscription. The inspired <strong>Stars and
Stripes</strong> editorial was picked ip by the <strong>N.Y. Times</strong> and
ballyhooed as conclusive proof that the &ldquo;fighting men
themselves&rdquo; are demanding the immediate enactment of the May
bill. &ldquo;This factor of morale,&rdquo; editorialized the <strong>Times</strong>,
&ldquo;is a consideration which we cannot afford to overlook. It is a
factor about which we are entitled to believe that Mr. Patterson and
General Marshall and Admiral King and Secretary Stimson and Secretary
Forrestal, all of whom support this (May) bill, are better informed
than are those manufacturers and trade unionists who are opposing
it.&rdquo; Indeed, they are not only &ldquo;better informed&rdquo;
after the fact, but before!</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;This factor of morale&rdquo; is as fraudulent as the
&ldquo;manpower&rdquo; and &ldquo;munitions&rdquo; shortage which was
used as the main pretext a few weeks ago for demanding a forced labor
law. The advocates of labor conscription dare not reveal the true
aims of such legislation. It is a strikebreaking, union-smashing
device, designed to regiment labor under a Prussianized military
caste. The May bill is still before the Senate Military Affairs
Committee. Labor must voice its uncompromising opposition through
resolutions, mass meetings and demonstrations, to halt this attack on
labor&rsquo;s rights and labor&rsquo;s freedom.</em></p>
