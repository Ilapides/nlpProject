<p class="fst">The capitalist press last week gleefully announced that all
&ldquo;organized&rdquo; resistance to compulsory labor legislation
had ended, with the endorsement of a &ldquo;substitute&rdquo;
manpower bill by top union officials. The labor leaders ended their
&ldquo;resistance&rdquo; by joining with the National Association of
Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in support of the
employer&rsquo;s &ldquo;manpower program.&rdquo; This substitute
measure was offered by Senators Kilgore and Wagner in place of the
May-Bailey slave labor bill, now before the Senate. It empowers the
War Manpower commission to enforce the job-freezing, compulsory labor
decrees, issued by Roosevelt over the past three years. If enacted
into law, the Kilgore-Wagner bill would tighten and extend these
drastic labor controls into the &ldquo;post-war&rdquo; period.</p>

<p>The Kilgore-Wagner &ldquo;substitute&rdquo; aims to put &ldquo;teeth&rdquo;
in the existing manpower regulations by granting the WMC statutory
authority to impose &ldquo;legal&rdquo; sanctions against the
workers. The &lsquo;teeth&rsquo; are sharpened to chew the labor
movement to pieces. One of the sharpest of these &ldquo;teeth&rdquo;
would &ldquo;legalize WMC&rsquo;s ruling that employers must do all
their hiring through the United States Employment Service or other
designated agencies.&rdquo; This provision would give the capitalist
government &ldquo;legal&rdquo; authority to grant or withhold
employment, to move workers from one plant to another, from one area
to another, or to keep them frozen to their jobs.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Roosevelt&rsquo;s Actions</h4>

<p class="fst">The Roosevelt administration has sought to concentrate this power
in its hands for some time. On Dec. 5, 1942 Roosevelt issued an
executive decree instructing the chairman of the War Manpower
Commission to take all &ldquo;lawful and appropriate&rdquo; steps,
&ldquo;to assure that all hiring and recruitment of workers for jobs
in any plants, facilities, occupation or areas designated by the
chairman shall be conducted solely through the United States
Employment Service or under arrangements be approves.&rdquo; Under
this decree WMC Chairman McNutt later issued an order effective July
1, 1944, instructing employers to &ldquo;hire all male help&rdquo;
through the offices of the U.S. Employment Service.</p>

<p><em>Under the Roosevelt-McNutt &ldquo;controlled referral&rdquo;
plan, workers who refused to accept jobs in plants and areas
designated by the WMC would be unable to get jobs elsewhere. In
addition, McNutt declared, they &ldquo;might be deprived of
unemployment compensation.&rdquo; The &ldquo;plan&rdquo; was a
&ldquo;work-where-you&rsquo;re-told-or-starve&rdquo; measure. It was
&ldquo;denounced as illegal by Representative William J. Miller,
Republican of Connecticut, who contended it invoked a national labor
draft without Congressional sanction. &lsquo;No wonder Mr. McNutt
refused to ask for passage of a national service act,&rsquo; he said.
&lsquo;He does not need such a law if he can get away with present
practices&rsquo;.&rdquo;</em> (<strong>N.Y. Times</strong>, June 3, 1944).</p>

<p>James L. McDevitt, President of the Pennsylvania State Federation
of Labor, also at that time denounced the Roosevelt-McNutt &ldquo;plan&rdquo;
as a forced labor scheme. It &ldquo;had everything that a labor draft
called for,&rdquo; he said. That is, &ldquo;everything&rdquo; except
a legal cover. The Kilgore-Wagner &ldquo;substitute&rdquo; endorsed
by the top officials of the AFL and CIO is designed to provide this
legal cover. While the Roosevelt-McNutt plan applied only to male
workers over 17 years of age, the Kilgore-Wagner bill covers both men
and women in all age groups. In this respect it is more sweeping than
the May-Bailey bill which applies only to male workers in the 18&ndash;45
age group.</p>

<p>The capitulation of the union leaders to the &ldquo;labor program&rdquo;
of the employers was prepared in a series of secret conferences
organized to work put a &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; to the pending May-
Bailey bill. In an exclusive dispatch from Washington, published over
a month ago on Jan. 11, a staff writer of the <strong>N.Y. Herald-Tribune</strong>
reported:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The collapse of organized resistance to a modified
national service hill, with the condition, however, that the military
shall not have the final say on the assignment of men to war jobs,
will be announced soon as a result of an agreement reached with
organized farm, labor and industry representatives, the <strong>N.Y.
Herald-Tribune</strong> learned tonight.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Secret Agreement</h4>

<p class="fst">The agreement, &ldquo;was reached in secret White House meetings,&rdquo;
under the &ldquo;aegis of the recently created War Mobilisation and
Reconversion Advisory Board. The Board is composed of representatives
of business, agriculture and labor. The labor representatives are
William Green, AFL, Philip Murray, CIO and T.C. Cashen, Railroad
Brotherhood. The secret agreement provided that the administration of
the proposed forced labor legislation be turned over to the War
Manpower Commission instead of the Selective Service which is under
direct control of the brass hats. It was presented to James F.
Byrnes, Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion, who withdrew
&ldquo;his previous opposition to transferring the important
assignment power from the military to the War Manpower Commission.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The above reported &ldquo;conference&rdquo; was one of a number
of secret meetings which has now resulted in the open support by
&ldquo;labor, agriculture and industry,&rdquo; for the Kilgore-Wagner
&ldquo;modified&rdquo; national service bill. An interesting
sidelight on this behind- the-scenes betrayal of labor was Philip
Murray&rsquo;s statement to the Senate Military Affairs Committee,
whining that Byrnes had double-crossed his &ldquo;advisory hoard.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;We respectfully submit,&rdquo; said Murray, &ldquo;that this
Senate committee should inquire why the advisory committee was not
consulted In advance of the presentation to a Congressional committee
of the May-Bailey bill.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">This deal to endorse forced labor legislation was engineered
behind the backs of the union membership. It was conceived behind
closed doors and hidden from the eyes of the union membership until
the labor bureaucrats sprung it in public. They neither consulted nor
advised the rank and file. This incident again confirms the truth of
our contention that. the struggle for the defense of the unions must
be conducted against the bureaucracy for the restoration of internal
union democracy.</p>

<p><em>This complete collapse of all resistance by the union
officialdom to forced labor legislation has simply served to embolden
reaction. Immediately following the labor bureaucrat&rsquo;s
endorsement of the Kilgore-Wagner bill, the brass hats announced the
formation of forced labor battalions. From now on workers who quit
their jobs &ldquo;without permission&rdquo; are to be inducted into a
works corps and forced to work at army pay in government-owned
munitions plants. The struggle of the workers against forced labor
will have to be carried forward under the leadership of the union
militants. There can be no compromise on this issue.</em></p>
