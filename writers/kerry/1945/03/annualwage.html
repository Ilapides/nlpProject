<p class="fst">A few days after the Advisory Board of the Office of War
Mobilization and Reconversion made public a resolution complaining
that they were not being called upon for &ldquo;advice,&rdquo;
Roosevelt announced he had ordered the board to &ldquo;study&rdquo;,
the question of a guaranteed annual wage. The demand for a guaranteed
annual wage was part of the steel wage case before the War Labor
Board and has become part of the CIO program.</p>

<p>the WLB rejected the demand but recommended a &ldquo;study&rdquo;
of the question to determine whether industry could &ldquo;afford&rdquo;
to give such a guarantee. In a letter to Roosevelt, the chairman of
the WLB disclosed that the fear of unemployment which has led to the
demand for a guaranteed annual wage, &ldquo;is contributing also to
the pressure for a change in the national wage stabilization policy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By shunting the demand for a guaranteed wage to the WMR advisory
board, Roosevelt aims to kill three birds with one stone.</p>

<ul>
<li>To divert the attention of the workers from the struggle
against the administration&rsquo;s wage-freezing &ldquo;stabilization
policy.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>To aid the &ldquo;labor statesmen&rdquo; in lulling their own
membership with the illusion that something is being done about the
problem of &ldquo;post-war&rdquo; security.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>To quiet the clamor of the WMR &ldquo;advisory board,&rdquo;
which has been completely ignored by director James F. Byrnes, whose
anti-labor decisions have been made without benefit of their advice.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">The popular demand for a guaranteed annual wage expresses the
profound desire of the workers for a decent standard of living for
all those able and willing to work. In essence, it represents a
revulsion against the insanity of the profit system which dooms
millions of workers to dire want, while factories remain idle and
food moulders in warehouses or rots in the fields. The working masses
are haunted by the memory of the pre-war depression which condemned
millions to idleness, hunger and despair, through no fault of their
own. They seek some measure of protection against a recurrence of
such conditions.</p>

<p>In ordering the study, Roosevelt blandly announced that &ldquo;he
had been talking about a guaranteed annual wage for about ten years.&rdquo;
To whom had he been talking about this for &ldquo;ten years?&rdquo;
Obviously, to himself &ndash; if it took ten years to get around to
the point of asking that a &ldquo;study&rdquo; be made of the
question.</p>

<p>And what ten years! The economic crisis raged during his w^ole
period of office. There were still ten million unemployed during the
war boom year of 1940. It was not until war production and the draft
absorbed the available labor force that unemployment was reduced to a
minimum.</p>

<p>During the ten years in which Roosevelt claims he &ldquo;talked&rdquo;
about a guaranteed wage, one-third of the people, by his own
admission, were ill-fed, ill-clothed and ill-housed. Millions of men
and women were on, the dole while factories stood idle. Under the
planned sabotage of the &ldquo;New Deal,&rdquo; cotton, corn and live
stock were plowed under in order to create an economy of artificial
scarcity. These measures &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; only poverty and
insecurity for the masses. But while all this was going on,
Roosevelt, according to his latest revelation, kept &ldquo;talking
about a guaranteed annual wage.&rdquo; How consoling!</p>

<p>Roosevelt&rsquo;s demagogic gesture in burying the demand in the
WMR advisory board is intended to head off the. independent action of
the workers in the fight for economic security. The fight for a
guaranteed annual wage is essentially a political struggle. If meant
seriously, it requires first of all that labor break with the
political parties and agents of the employing class and take the road
of fighting for its own program under its own political banner.</p>
