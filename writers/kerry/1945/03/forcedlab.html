<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1945/index.htm#m45_09" target="new">Vol.&#160;IX No.&#160;9</a>, 3 March 1945, pp.&nbsp;1 &amp;&nbsp;4.<br />

<p class="fst">The Senate Military Affairs Committee concluded closed hearings on
the May-Bailey slave labor bill last week by reporting out a
&ldquo;substitute&rdquo; measure incorporating the principle of
compulsory labor for private profit. The Kilgore-Wagner &ldquo;substitute&rdquo;
was adopted by a vote of 13 to 4 shortly after the committee had
received a memorandum from Roosevelt stating: &ldquo;I hope that
legislation embracing the principle of the May bill can be speedily
enacted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under this prodding from the &ldquo;Commander-in-Chief&rdquo; the
Kilgore-Wagner substitute was amended to make it conform to the type
of legislation demanded by Roosevelt and his brass hats.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;These changes, committeemen agreed, brought the
substitute bill sponsored by Senators O&rsquo;Mahoney, Kilgore,
Wagner, Chandler, Ferguson and Ball, closer to the principles of the
May-Bailey measure.&rdquo; (<strong>N.Y. Times</strong>, Feb. 22)</p>

<p class="fst">One of the amendments provides that &ldquo;violators of WMC
regulations and orders would be liable to fines up to $10,000 or jail
sentences up to a year.&rdquo; Another provides that workers &ldquo;who
quit essential agricultural jobs without draft board permission would
be subject, to fines ranging to $10,000 and prison terms up to five
years.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>CIO Endorses Bill</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>In its original form, the Kilgore-Wagner bill would concentrate
control over hiring in the hands of the War Manpower Commission. The
WMC would be given authority to establish manpower ceilings in
industry, to move workers from one plant or one area to another, to
keep workers tied to their jobs at frozen wages. Employers would be
forbidden to hire a worker unless he could show a certificate of
availability. By its power to refuse to grant certificates to
&ldquo;recalcitrant&rdquo; workers, the WMC would exercise
&ldquo;work-where-you&rsquo;re-told-or-starve&rdquo; compulsion over
labor.</em></p>

<p>The additional amendments add the &ldquo;work-where-you&rsquo;re-told-or-
go-to-jail&rdquo; penalties of the May- Bailey bill to the
Kilgore-Wagner substitute. As announced in <strong>The Militant</strong> last
week, the latter measure was endorsed by the heads of the AFL and CIO
in a &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; deal with the employers. &ldquo;This
(Kilgore-Wagner) bill is a long step in the right direction,&rdquo;
declared Philip Murray in a statement to the Senate Military Affairs
Committee.</p>

<p>An editorial in the <strong>CIO News</strong> &ldquo;explains&rdquo; that
the CIO officialdom</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;... supports the bill introduced by Senators
Kilgore, Wagner and Ferguson because, as Pres. Philip Murray states,
&lsquo;this bill reinforces the methods and machinery which have
proven effective during the war, and proposes means for strengthening
them,&rsquo; and because it is &lsquo;designed to mobilize the entire
civilian manpower and womanpower of the United States immediately,
and not merely males between the ages of 18 and 45&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Roosevelt&rsquo;s Strategy</h4>

<p class="fst">Murray&rsquo;s statement is an open endorsement of the principle
of forced labor for private profit. The &ldquo;methods and machinery&rdquo;
which he urges be, &ldquo;strengthened&rdquo; are the instruments of
labor compulsion embodied in the drastic manpower decrees issued by
Roosevelt and administered by the WMC. Under these decrees the WMC
recently initiated the infamous &ldquo;Allentown Plan&rdquo; which
has since been spread to other areas.</p>

<p>In Allentown, Pennsylvania, where the &ldquo;plan&rdquo;
originated, the WMC ordered the discharge of hundreds of workers who
were then instructed to apply to the U.S. Employment Service for
assignment to other jobs. Those failing to obey &ldquo;would be
denied employment for the duration of the war.&rdquo; In a majority
of cases, workers were forced to accept employment at lower wages.</p>

<p>Will Allen, Washington correspondent of <strong>Justice</strong>, official
organ of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, who has
closely followed the development of the forced labor campaign,
contends &ldquo;that the real labor conscription threat is embodied
in the Allentown Plan rather than the May-Bailey bill.&rdquo; He
states that the strategy of the Roosevelt administration is to use
the threat of the &ldquo;more drastic&rdquo; May- Bailey bill to jam
through a &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; measure. This &ldquo;compromise&rdquo;
worked out in secret in a behind-the-scenes deal is incorporated in
the &ldquo;substitute&rdquo; Kilgore-Wagner bill. Allen discloses
what the forced labor advocates are after by declaring:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;What they&rsquo;re after &ndash; in terms of
administration strategy &ndash; is a Congressional act legalizing the
Allentown Plan. Why is that? Because the Allentown Plan draws its
authority from an Executive Order which went into effect July 1, and
not from an Act of Congress. The Allentown Plan interferes with the
rights of private citizens engaged in pursuits having no connection
with the war. The Allentown Plan enforces involuntary servitude ...
which is a direct violation of the Constitution of the United
States.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;The Administration,&rdquo; Allen continues, &ldquo;is
anxious to find a legal cover &ndash; to be provided by Congress &ndash;
to sanction the dubious legality of its previous efforts to force
labor conscription on the country. The Administration has known for a
long time that labor conscription by Executive Order is on legally
shaky ground ... as witness how long it has waited since July 1 to
put it into effect in the Allentown Plan.&rdquo; (For information on
the origin and development of the Allentown Plan, see <strong>The
Militant</strong>, Feb. 24, 1945).</p>

<p class="fst">This is the treacherous &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; that Murray,
Green and Company are urging the workers to support. &ldquo;Urge your
Senator,&rdquo; pleads the <strong>CIO News</strong> editorial, &ldquo;to vote
for the Kilgore-Wagner-Ferguson bill.&rdquo; The union militants must
arouse the workers to reject this injunction. Urge the workers to
adopt resolutions, organize demonstrations, utilize every means, to
make known labor&rsquo;s uncompromising opposition to any and all
forms of forced labor.</p>
