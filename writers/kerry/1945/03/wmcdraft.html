<p class="fst">The textile community of New Bedford, Mass., has been up in arms
against the attempt of the War Manpower Commission to apply the
forced-labor &ldquo;Allentown Plan&rsquo;&rsquo; to the workers of
that city. Several weeks ago, the WMC ordered the discharge of over
100 textile workers with the announced intention of forcing them to
take jobs in the Fisk and Firestone tire fabric plants.</p>

<p>Under the &ldquo;Allentown Plan&rdquo; employment ceilings on
certain &ldquo;non-essential&rdquo; industries are reduced. The
workers discharged are directed to the U.S. Employment Service for
assignment to other jobs. &ldquo;If the workers refuse the jobs,&rdquo;
explained one WMC official, &ldquo;the USES bars them from any
employment by refusing them job referrals.&rdquo; The &ldquo;plan&rdquo;
is a work-where-you&rsquo;re-told-or-starve scheme based on the
compulsory labor decrees of the Roosevelt administration.</p>

<p>With one or two exceptions, the workers discharged from the New
Bedford textile mills have refused to accept jobs in the tire fabric
plants. Antonio England, New Bedford director of the CIO Textile
Workers Union, declared they refused because &ldquo;of exhaustive
stretchouts in both plants and because of exhaustive speed-ups.&rdquo;
The workers of the Fisk and Firestone plants have been trying to
better their working conditions but the War Labor Board has
pigeon-holed their grievances.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;Now when others who know about these disputes,&rdquo;
added England, &ldquo;are asked to go towork in the fabric mills
anyway, they resent it. To them it appears that the government, by
means of the manpower ceilings and the offer of jobs in the tire
fabric plants only, is coming to the aid of the management in this
controversy.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">&ldquo;The WMC,&rdquo; comments a Scripps-Howard reporter, &ldquo;as
well as the Army (which is behind the scenes), doesn&rsquo;t look at
it that way.&rdquo; Their attitude is that&rsquo; &ldquo;the workers
should gladly give up their jobs in the civilian goods mills and
accept employment in the fabric plants, even if it should mean a
temporary hardship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These political and military agents of the employers never
hesitate to call for additional sacrifices from the workers. But when
George Baldanzi, executive vice-president of the Textile Workers
Union, offered to supply all the workers needed if the &ldquo;tire
cord plants were taken over and operated by the government without
profit,&rdquo; the professional patriots shut up like a clam!</p>

<p>Because of the vigorous opposition of the unions, supported in
this case by the city administration and the local textile
manufacturers, the government agents are determined to make a test
case in New Bedford. They have refused any concessions.</p>

<p>The Kilgore-Wagner bill, now before the Senate, is designed to
&ldquo;legalize&rdquo; the &ldquo;Allentown Plan.&quot; In presenting
it, Senator Thomas, chairman of the Military Affairs Committee,
declared that the bill aims &ldquo;to enact a statutory basis for two
basic types of regulation: First, employment ceilings under which
employers could be required to release workers, and second, hiring
controls under which workers so released or otherwise available for
new jobs could be channeled to suitable jobs where they were most
needed.&rdquo;</p>
