<p class="fst">Dear Comrade Trotsky:</p>

<p class="fst">I take the liberty of adding a <em>personal</em> word to the letter which Marceau Pivert has written you. I was out of town, and not present at the meeting of the party executive at which the contents of that letter were approved.</p>

<p>If I had been present I should undoubtedly have insisted that the last section should have been put differently.</p>

<p>I am not altogether in agreement, indeed, with my comrades on the executive when they emphasize <em>serious differences</em> which might exist between the POI and the PSOP I believe that these &#8220;serious differences&#8221; were created artificially by the sectarianism of certain of your friends, such as Naville. And I regret that we take up, on our side, the assertion that these &#8220;serious differences&#8221; exist. I have the impression that, on both sides, we take refuge behind these &#8220;differences&#8221; in order not to unite.</p>

<p>I do not believe, moreover, that a &#8220;united front&#8221; would be preferable to fusion, nor that such a fusion would <em>necessarily</em> carry &#8220;in its breast the germs of confusion and speedy disintegration&#8221;.</p>

<p>It is possible, even quite possible that it might be so, <em>but only in the event that your friends should consider the fusion as a disloyal maneuver</em>, planning to get a foothold as an &#8220;alien body&#8221; in the PSOP, in such a way as to destroy it from within and to prepare a new split &#8211; that is, to drag along, for the purpose of forming a new POI, a certain number of our militants. Yes, if that should be the plan of your friends, the fusion would be &#8220;illusory&#8221; and disastrous.</p>

<p>But I cannot believe, in spite of the <em>suspicion</em> which the tactic of certain of your friends arouses in me, I cannot believe that, in the present serious circumstances, they would commit the crime of destroying the <em>only</em> movement which, in France, can serve as the crucible for forming the revolutionary vanguard. Consequently, I do not dismiss the possibility of a loyal fusion.</p>

<p>You will not stand on formality if I tell you exactly what I think: it is upon <em>you, upon you alone</em>, that there depends the question of whether the fusion would be loyal or disloyal.</p>

<p>In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I point out that by <em>fusion</em> I mean, naturally, the entry of the members of the POI as individuals into the PSOP: the numerical disproportion between the POI and the PSOP, on the one hand, and the approach of our next convention, on the other, rule out a special fusion convention.</p>

<p>But it is actually a question of fusion, because the voice of your friends, in accordance with our principles of full workers&#8217; democracy, will be able to be freely heard in our party &#8211; as early, I believe, as our convention in May.</p>

<p>The only difference which I see between your friends and us, and I persist in regarding it as purely formal, is the question of the &#8220;Fourth&#8221;. We want to build a new revolutionary international. The only &#8220;difference&#8221; springs from the fact that you have baptised your international secretariat as the &#8220;Fourth International&#8221;, whereas in our opinion the new international cannot be created by a wave of the magic wand. It will be borne within the <em>masses,</em> and the <em>masses</em> must be actively prepared for it, must be made to understand its necessity, must be made to find the road that leads to it. Yes, I repeat (though I understand in advance your vehement protest) that it is a question only of a <em>formal difference</em>. It should not become an obstacle to the indispensable re-grouping, the indispensable and urgent re-enforcing of the revolutionary vanguard in France.</p>
