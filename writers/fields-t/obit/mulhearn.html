<p class="fst">Tragically Terry Fields has died from lung cancer at the age of
71. Terry was a supporter of <strong>Militant</strong>, forerunner of the
Socialist Party, and a defender of the working class. In 1983, after
many years as a lay official for the fire fighters&#8217; union, he was
elected as an MP for Liverpool Broadgreen on a clear socialist
programme. His campaign slogan was &#8220;vote for a workers&#8217; MP on a
worker&#8217;s wage&#8221;.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in the minds of the Broadgreen electorate that
Terry was a dyed-in-the wool radical socialist, because it was
published in his campaign material and the capitalist press told them
so. Terry was celebrated for his dedication to workers in struggle.
He was a regular on the miners&#8217; picket line. He supported the
printers at Warrington when they fought Eddie Shah, the stalking
horse for the press magnates who were preparing to smash the print unions.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t only British workers who enjoyed Terry&#8217;s support and
solidarity. He was invited in 1990 to a conference in Novokuznetsk
setting up a Confederation of Labour of the USSR. As a socialist and
internationalist he addressed the 600 delegates and visitors &#8211;
mostly mineworkers &#8211; congratulating them on their strikes and
struggles to throw off the old, parasitic bureaucracy. He warned them
against taking the &#8220;road to the market&#8221;, and defended the ideas
of genuine socialism against both Stalinism and capitalism.</p>

<p>In addition to fighting for a remedy to the problems facing
working-class families in his constituency, he gave unconditional
support to the Liverpool 47 in their titanic battle with the Tory
government and Labour right wing. The Liverpool 47 were Liverpool&#8217;s
socialist councillors who built five thousand houses, created
thousands of jobs, and opened many nursery schools in 1983&#8211;87.</p>

<p>Terry kept his pledge to take only a worker&#8217;s wage and donated
the remainder back to the labour movement. On this score he invited
the bile of career MPs whose snouts in the parliamentary pig trough
have been an ongoing scandal.</p>

<p>Terry played a leading role in opposing Thatcher&#8217;s hated poll
tax. The non-payment campaign eventually defeated both the tax and
Thatcher. Alongside 18 million people he refused to pay the tax. For
this he served 60 days in Walton jail. In his response to Terry&#8217;s
imprisonment, former Labour Party leader, Neil Kinnock, showed his
true colours. His reaction was not a condemnation of the poll tax,
but an attack on Terry for breaking the law!</p>

<p>Terry supported the slogan of the imprisoned Poplar councillors of
1919, adopted by the Liverpool 47: &#8220;Better to break the law than
break the poor.&#8221; He pointed out that if people had not been
prepared to break unjust laws in the past there wouldn&#8217;t be a
Labour Party for Kinnock to lead.</p>

<p>He refused to pay his poll tax even though some, who later
deserted <strong>Militant</strong>&#8217;s ranks, urged him to pay it.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">A role model for today</h4>

<p class="fst">Standing over six feet, Terry was a big man in every sense. His
lifestyle was that of the working class. Not for him the fancy cars
and silk suits. In fact he was known in parliament, to the annoyance
of the chief whip, for wearing his trademark leather jacket.</p>

<p>He had a deft turn of phrase. At a meeting to mark the 20th
anniversary of the 47 councillors&#8217; surcharge he said: &#8220;Neil
Kinnock had been a young firebrand with socialism spewing out of
every orifice &#8211; but he finished up with something else spewing out
of every orifice!&#8221;</p>

<p>In his private life he enjoyed a social life in the local club
mingling with working people from the community. He was a good singer
and sang with a skiffle group in the 1960s, and he was no mean bingo caller.</p>

<p>These days there are calls for millionaire professional
footballers and other sporting celebrities to act as role models for
the youth. Terry Fields was the perfect role model for today&#8217;s
young people who look for a solution to their everyday problems of
work and security for the future. But they look in vain at the
current crop of parliamentary miscreants.</p>
