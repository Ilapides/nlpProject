<p class="fst"><strong>To the residents of Broadgreen,</strong></p>

<p class="fst">You will know that I have been sentenced to 60 days in prison for
not paying the poll tax. As the media will misrepresent my actions, I
am writing to each family in Broadgreen.</p>

<p>I have been jailed for my principles, for defending the people who
elected me. I am not the first to suffer class injustice. Pensioners
and other impoverished people have been imprisoned for the so-called
&#8216;crime&#8217; of being unable to pay the poll tax.</p>

<p>Workers were jailed for organising the first trade unions &#8211; and
since. Women were jailed whilst campaigning for the right to vote.
But for people who were prepared to put their principles before their
self-interest, we would not have any democratic rights today.</p>

<p>I was the victim of a kangaroo court. My solicitor showed that the
poll tax authorities have acted illegally &#8211; but the magistrates
chose to ignore this. They were out to make an example of me, to try
and intimidate ordinary people into paying the poll tax.</p>

<p>You elected me as your MP in 1983 and again in 1987. I promised to
be a workers&#8217; MP on a workers&#8217; wage. Since then I&#8217;ve remained
on the wage of a firefighter, not the &#163;28,000 that most MP&#8217;s live
on. I remain true to the people of Broadgreen, remaining in touch
with your conditions.</p>

<p>Since you elected me I have seen the savage attacks on workers,
pensioners, the unemployed and our children. The poll tax is the
worst of these attacks. It aims to pauperise the already needy and
line the pockets of the super-rich. The vast majority agree that it
is the most vicious law imposed on the nation.</p>

<p>14 million ordinary people banded together in mass civil
disobedience, refusing to pay. They caused the downfall of Thatcher.
Mass non-payment forced the Tories to concede a &#163;140 rebate to all
poll tax payers. It forced the Tories to promise poll tax abolition.</p>

<p>But the poll tax remains for two years. I have pledged to stand
with those unable to pay &#8211; the low-paid, the pensioner, the
housewife, those on benefits. For those law-abiding people it is not
a question of breaking the law but their inability to pay. For me it
is a question of not abandoning them but of standing shoulder to
shoulder with them.</p>

<p>I am no martyr. I did not wish to go to prison, to be separated
from my family. I know from many of my constituents just how
appalling prison conditions are. But I was elected to defend your
interests. If imprisonment is the price for being principled, for
saying what I mean and meaning what I say, so be it. Hopefully my
stand will hasten the complete abolition of the poll tax.</p>

<p>The Tories and their rich friends in industry are the ones who
should be on trial. They have destroyed our NHS, underfunded our
education system, condemned our children to a life on the dole. The
fat cats in industry reap in profits one day, award themselves
obscene pay rises and sack workers the next. These are the real
criminals, guilty of crimes against all of us.</p>

<p>I remain at your service, standing with you against injustice,
feeling privileged to represent you. I will not rest until all my
constituents are free from the fear of poll tax debt, bailiffs and jailings.</p>

<p class="c"><em><strong>Stand up to the Tories!</strong></em></p>
