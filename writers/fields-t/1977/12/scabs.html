<p class="c"><strong>Terry Fields</strong> (Merseyside FBU) spoke to <strong>Terry Harrison</strong></p>

<p class="fst"><em>The officers on Merseyside who are breaking the strike are few and far between, compared with the total numbers.</em> The lads on the division know who these men are, they have seen them pushing their way past firemen with abandon, doing their own thing, abusing firemen and rubbing their noses in it, in an attempt to break our strike.</p>

<p>Firemen come in on the job on a one tier system. It is in the capability of everyone to reach officer status. People in officer status should remember their background and remember where they came from, remember they have got to work with firemen.</p>

<p>Our main concern after wages is the future of the British fire service and if we have no respect for our officers then the British fire service has had it. And we have certainly no respect for strike-breaking scabs of officers who have been pushing their way past firemen on picket lines, insisting on doing a job of work quite outside the bounds of the national agreement we have had with the National Association of Fire Officers.</p>
