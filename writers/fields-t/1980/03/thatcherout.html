Many labour activists support this view:</strong></p><p class="c">[Feature includes comments from LP/TU figures including Emlyn Williams, Terry Fields, Tony Saunois, Tony Mulhearn]</p><h4>Terry Fields [FBU National Executive]</h4><p class="fst">&#8220;The situation as far as our executive is concerned is that we have taken a decision that on 14 May the firemen nationally will be on a work to rule, answering emergency calls only, although he decision has not been yet finalised. I think it&#8217;s crucial that the firemen should be included in it, and that we are seen to be participating.</p><p>&#8220;A 24-hour general strike call is certainly not premature. Some people are accusing us of being extremists, and over-reacting to the situation, but if you see my home area of Merseyside, for example, you&#8217;d understand that people are fed up with the way a whole area has been ravaged by the Tories. I think it&#8217;s long overdue, but it&#8217;s got to be co-ordinated properly. The leadership up there say get involved locally in your local cuts committee etc., but a definite need for a national strategy could be laid down &#8211; hopefully by the conference called by the Liverpool Trades Council and Labour Party, to co-ordinate activity will get a good response nationally, and put pressure on the national leadership to really take this thing on board fully. We&#8217;ve got to get it well orchestrated because there&#8217;s no way that you can just push the problems around and then forget all about it.&#8221;</p><p class="link">&#160;<br /><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" width="100%" /><p class="linkback"><a href="../../index.html">Terry Fields Archive</a>&#160;&#160; | &#160;&#160;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/index.htm">ETOL Main Page</a></p><p class="updat">Last updated: 19 January 2018</p></body>
