<p class="fst">Complete banning of the right to strike and a crippling of free
trade unions! That&#8217;s what the reactionary bosses&#8217; government in
Sri Lanka wants.</p>

<p>But hundreds of thousands of workers are still out in a
magnificent general strike called by the Joint Trade Union Action
Committee [see page 8].</p>

<p>British trade unionists will not stand by and let their brothers
in Sri Lanka be ground down and stripped of all democratic trade
union rights. Already several trade union general secretaries have
sent telegrams of protest to the Sri Lankan government.</p>

<p>The Fire Brigades Union have given moral and financial support to
the workers and the Bakers&#8217; Union Executive will take up the matter
next week. A deputation from the Labour Party NEC will meet the High
Commissioner in London soon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, dockers, airport workers and Post Office workers are
discussing the possibility of blacking Sri Lankan trade. The
Merseyside Docks shop stewards&#8217; Executive were due to discuss
action this week, and the Post Office Engineers Union members are to
propose cutting communications.</p>

<p>Every trade union branch, Labour Party and Young Socialists branch
should immediately rush protests against the Sri Lankan government&#8217;s
anti-union attempts to: Sri Lanka High Commission, 13 Hyde Park
Gardens, London W.2.</p>

<p>Messages of support for the union should go to JTUAC c/o United
Federation of Labour, 17 Barrack Lane, Colombo 2, Sri Lanka. Please
send copies of these messages to Wesley Mutiah, 19 Hawthorn Avenue,
London N.13.</p>

<p>Make sure that your national trade union leadership sends a
message too! Black all Sri Lankan goods, finance and services for the
duration of the general strike!</p>

<p>The government has frozen the funds of the trade unions and seized
twelve union headquarters. Financial assistance is desperately
needed. Please take collections and rush donations to the United
Federation of Labour, c/o Wesley Muthian [address above].</p>
