<p class="fst"><em>PEOPLE TALK about the rule of law and parliament but this
government was elected in 1983 with a reduced majority from 1979; a
big majority of the population didn&#8217;t vote for them.</em></p>

<p>In Liverpool there was a swing to Labour in the council elections
despite a national swing against. In the general election there was a
two and a half per cent swing to Labour in Liverpool. In my
constituency, Broadgreen, we had a four and a half per cent swing.</p>
<p>That is an indication that the programme we have gone out on at
local authority and parliamentary level is one that people have been
prepared to support.</p>

<p>Even in the <strong>Liverpool Echo</strong> we have a statement from a Tory
so-called &#8216;dossier&#8217; that the policies of Labour have been known
at least since 1981. An article by Derek Hatton in the <strong>Echo</strong>
then indicated what Labour would do.</p>

<p>In Liverpool there have been a whole series of public meetings,
mass rallies, reaching all sections of the community. Despite the
press lies, the unions and the mass of the rank and file are coming
fairly and squarely behind Labour.</p>

<p>Over the past months there has been a wide programme of activity
by Liverpool city councillors who have gone to every
Labour-controlled authority in the country.</p>

<p>In the last week I and other people have addressed a number of
meetings in London to explain Liverpool&#8217;s situation, and received
magnificent support. We have got Labour MPs from the London area,
from the Campaign Group of MPs, London councillors and local
authority workers to come to Liverpool before the 29th to support the council.</p>

<p>When all this is going on it is a scandal that we have got people
on the council prepared to stab the movement in the back. What is
even more scandalous is that they have had the opportunity over the
past months, indeed since last May, to raise any reservations about
the policy, and got support from certain Labour Parliamentary spokesmen.</p>

<p>Liverpool&#8217;s five Labour MPs are solid in support of the city
council. We were elected to fight for the people of Liverpool, not to
carry out the dirty work of the Tories.</p>
