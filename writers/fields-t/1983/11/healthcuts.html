<h1>Mersey health cuts &#8211; MPs speak out</h1>

<p class="fst"><strong>Despite the overwhelming opposition of local district health
authorities, doctors, health workers and the community as a whole,
the Tories are determined to go ahead with big cuts in the funding of
Liverpool area health authority. The significance of these cutbacks
to the service provided to working people can be gauged by some of
the comments, reproduced here, of Merseyside Labour MPs speaking in a
special Parliamentary debate on the issue last week.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The key element, however, in the fight to retain the standards
of service and NHS jobs &#8211; in Liverpool and nationally &#8211; will be
the struggles of the wider trade union and labour movement, and
especially of the workers in the NHS trade unions themselves.</strong></p>

<p class="fst"><strong>Terry Fields MP</strong> (Liverpool, Broadgreen):</p>

<p class="fst">The government must be warned. The fight back has already started
in Liverpool. Although people are on their knees, they are prepared
to struggle and to take on the government and those acting on their
behalf in their attacks on the health service.</p>

<p>Liverpool has suffered a cutback of 422 hospital beds, including
20 per cent of medical and geriatric beds.</p>

<p>There has been a cut of 25 per cent in surgical beds and 22 per
cent in children&#8217;s beds. Also, 273 psychiatric long-stay beds for
the elderly and mentally ill is a long way short of the recommended
level. The Liverpool health area will suffer staff cuts of about 679.
Having spoken to those involved, I believe that the figure will be
closer to 1,000 ...</p>

<p>I have spoken not to the consultants but to the workers, to NUPE
and to COHSE. They are prepared to fight and struggle for their jobs,
irrespective of whether the Government or the regional health
authority are trying to take them away. They care about the people in
their hospital beds and the people of Liverpool who will lose the
services. They are prepared to take on the Government.</p>

<p>... We are on record as saying that, although we have to fight the
Government&#8217;s legislative proposals in the House, Liverpool Members
will be back on the picket lines with those workers defending their
jobs and services in our area.</p>

<p>We are prepared to fight for the workers. We warn the Government
now that their policies will lead to confrontation in areas such as
Liverpool. We shall be four square behind those workers.</p>
