<p class="fst"><small><strong>The Police and Criminal Evidence Bill was debated in the
House of Commons on 7 November at its second reading.</strong></small></p>

<p><small><strong>The Bill proposes drastic new laws covering the searching,
arrest and detention of suspects. It removes many safeguards and
tries to &#8220;solve&#8221; the enormous social problems in Britain by a
greatly strengthened police force.</strong></small></p>

<p><small><strong>We print below the speech by Terry Fields, Labour MP for
Liverpool Broadgreen which shows clearly why workers and
socialists argue for accountability of the police in the community.</strong></small></p>

<p><small><strong>The speech infuriated certain members of the Conservative
Party front and back benches. One Tory MP Tony Baldry, the MP for
Banbury said he was tempted to invite Terry Fields to his
constituency and pay his expenses so that the public could hear
the real voice of the Labour Party!</strong></small></p>

<p><small><strong>Mr. Baldry, for once, is correct. This is the voice of the
organised working class. The Labour Party should ensure that the
arguments used by Terry Fields are given wide publicity in the
campaign for the defeat of the Police Bill and for full
accountability of the police.</strong></small></p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst"><em>THE discussion about accountability and lack of accountability
is not new.</em></p>

<p><em>It has been going on throughout the history of the police force
and the various vested interests which have been pulling law and
order about during that period.</em></p>

<p>The police have not always been unaccountable to local pressures
and local democracy. When the Metropolitan police and the police
forces up and clown the country were created in 1829 they were under
the control of watch committees made up of local councillors who
fixed pay and conditions and looked after the everyday running of the
police forces.</p>

<p>When the county councils were formed in 1880, they had standing
joint committees &#8211; 50 per cent county councillors and 50 per cent
local magistrates &#8211; with powers similar to watch committees and
absolute control over the running of those police forces.</p>

<p>Chief constables made weekly reports to the county councils as a
duty, but continuous pressure from government to establish greater
central control, as today, was resisted by local interests.</p>

<p>During the 19th century the Home Secretary&#8217;s main role was the
maintenance of adequate police forces and establishments. Perhaps
that is what certain Home Secretaries should be confining themselves
to in modern times.</p>

<p>The relationship at that time was not only a matter of convenience
but a reflection of the balance of class forces in society and the
political relations that flowed from them. At that time borough
councils were dominated by industrialists and commercial capitalists
who paid the police out of the rates and therefore legitimately
insisted on democratic control over the police.</p>

<p>The industrial middle class was suspicious of government which it
associated with extravagance and unnecessary expenditure &#8211; a crime
of which it would not accuse the present government &#8211; and which it
feared would interfere in its affairs on behalf of the aristocratic
oligarchy which dominated government at the time.</p>

<p>The demand again was for local democracy and accountability. This
was <em>before</em> the working class became an independent political
force in society.</p>

<p>When the majority of the working class obtained the vote in 1918 &#8211;
women obtained it in 1928 &#8211; there was a complete change of tune on
the part of the ruling class of this country. It arose not out of a
fear of the aristocrats, who had served their purpose and no longer
posed a threat, but out of a fear of the growing strength of the
Labour movement.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The myth of neutrality</h4>

<p class="fst">At the end of the first world war Labour councillors were elected,
and in some areas there were Labour-controlled local authorities. The
attempt by the state to take control out of local hands and to
centralise it was made even more urgent after the police strikes of
1918 and 1919, which were a reflection of what was taking place in society.</p>

<p>After the strikes, the Desborough report made recommendations for
the overhaul of the structure of the police force. It made
recommendations on appointments, promotions and discipline within
police forces.</p>

<p>There was an attempt to take those responsibilities out of the
hands of watch committees and to give them to chief constables to
interpret, which was resisted in the House until 1964.</p>

<p>During that period, the powers of chief constables were
strengthened and the element of democratic control through watch
committees was strangled. The demand for democracy brought about a
Royal Commission in 1960 which identified the main problem as the
control of chief constables.</p>

<p>The Royal Commission&#8217;s idea of resolving the problem was to make
chief constables more accountable to central Government and not to
the watch committees made up of local people with an interest in
their localities. Despite all that, the local authorities still had
to pay 50 per cent of the cost.</p>

<p>At that time, we saw the establishment by chief constables of the
principle that operational matters were beyond the purview and
outside the scope of police committees. The new police committees
that were set up were not even made up of local councils and
councillors but were independent statutory bodies divorced from local
councils and local affairs.</p>

<p>Chief constables have consistently resisted attempts at democratic
control by local authorities and councillors. In so doing, they have
suggested that such accountability would make them subject to
political pressure and control.</p>

<p>In effect, they are perpetuating the myth &#8211; which is important
for them to gain public acceptance of their role in the past &#8211; that
the police are an arm of a neutral state, above politics and removed
from the everyday events in society.</p>

<p>Let us look at the reality of that so-called neutrality, in the
stormy events of the 1970s and since. We saw a new decade of crisis
which brought real and significant changes in planning and the
training of our police.</p>

<p>If we look at the events of 1971, with the government of the right
hon. member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr Heath) and his Industrial
Relations Act, we see that the police came into sharp conflict with
the trade union movement.</p>

<p>That was brought to a sharp point in 1972 with the miners&#8217; strike
and the battles at Saltley gate where the police were defeated and
forced to retreat by miners with the support of the trade union movement.</p>

<p>It is with no great pleasure that we talk about the defeat of a
group of workers. We identify the police as workers, subject to the
same economic pressures as any of us, our families and others in
society. Such a defeat of workers gives us no pleasure.</p>

<p>More important, the defeat of the police and the Heath government
was a crushing blow to the Tories. It demonstrated the weakness of
the capitalist state when faced with an organised and mobilised
labour movement.</p>

<p>It brought about an immediate review of security policies. We had
the police on the streets to deal with insurrection, a national
security committee was set up and in 1977 we saw riot shields on our
streets for the first time.</p>

<p>To protect the working class? Certainly not. It was to protect
Fascists in Lewisham. Anti-Fascist demonstrators were subjected to
oppression by the police and there were deaths on the streets.</p>

<p>Also during that period, we saw the army supporting the police in
their repressive attitudes towards the working class and the general
public. Of course, not only the outlook of hard-line police chiefs is involved.</p>

<p>The events of the 1970s opened a new perspective to the ruling
class. They saw that social peace and the post-war boom were over,
and they saw the onset of crisis in our society, which is endemic in
the system.</p>

<p>They foresaw a catastrophic decline in our economic base, the
inevitable erosion of living standards of ordinary people, and a
headlong clash with organised workers and the labour movement.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The fears of the ruling class</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>In August this year the <strong>Liverpool Echo</strong> carried an
exclusive article revealing that the ruling class &#8211; people like
Basil de Ferranti, Sir Hector Laing and the Duke of Kent &#8211; have
regular meetings with the Duke of Edinburgh in Buckingham Palace.</em></p>

<p><em>They are worried about what is happening in the inner city
areas such as Liverpool and they fear what will come about because of
unemployment and social unrest. Those statements were made not by me
but by the Liverpool Echo.</em></p>

<p><em>The article added that the police and the armed forces were
prepared to go on to the streets when industrial or civil unrest took
place. No attempt has been made to hide their views.</em></p>

<p>We must look at the myths and realities of the present situation.
On one side we have the law and order lobby, the so-called supporters
of peace and democracy, and on the other we have us scallywags on the
Labour benches.</p>

<p>Any criticism of the excesses of police constables are attacked as
an attempt to undermine the fight against crime. The previous Home
Secretary told the Tory Party conference in 1977 that it was a
Left-wing mythology that there was something despicable, almost
immoral, in discussing the prevention of crime at all.</p>

<p>We are not opposed to the police taking action to catch criminals
and to protect people&#8217;s safety and property. Working people are
naturally worried about crime and increasing violence, but the
Conservative benches and Tory Party spokesmen elevate moral issues
and abstractions of law and legality and seek to turn attention away
from the social roots of crime.</p>

<p><em>We are not just do-gooders. We live the experience of people in
inner cities.</em> We do not pass through in our cars occasionally and
get lifted by the bobbies.</p>

<p>In an article, not written by a left-wing lunatic or a Marxist,
the Boston police commissioner, Robert Di Grazia, said:</p>

<blockquote><em>&#8220;We are not letting the public in on our era&#8217;s dirty
little secret, that those who commit the crime that worries citizens
most &#8211; violent street crime &#8211; are, for the most part, the
products of poverty, unemployment, broken homes, rotten education,
drug addiction and alcoholism, and other social ills about which the
police can do little, if anything.&#8221;</em></blockquote>

<p class="fst">The same applies in Britain. After the Brixton disturbances, the
Prime Minister talked about the breakdown of respect for the law, and
the erosion of moral values. She and her Government cannot accept
that their economic policies have had a shattering effect especially
on youths and have helped to create the conditions for conflict on
the streets.</p>

<p>If there has been a breakdown of previously accepted social norms
of behaviour and of traditional morality, the Government have failed
to see that the terrible alienation of young people, created by the
profit system, has been a powerful contributory factor.</p>

<p>We will not solve such problems by arming the police, or by
providing them with riot gear, better water cannon, more CS gas and
plastic bullets. I am supported in that proposition by ex-Chief
Constable Alderson of Devon and Cornwall, who is perhaps <em>persona
non grata</em> with some other chief constables. He said: <em>&#8220;One
thing is certain, it is no answer to resort to brute force to control people.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>He may be in the minority and considered to be a do-gooder or a
liberal, but nevertheless his view is supported in our society. The
emphasis should be on crime prevention, and unless the police have
the confidence and support of the people whom they protect, there is
no hope of fighting crime.</p>

<p>Recent events do not show that the public support the police
massively. Some chief constables are coming to grips with the fact
that society cannot put the emphasis on social welfare, and are
preoccupied with the task of defending the <em>status quo</em> and of
upholding authority, which they define as law and order.</p>

<p>They are not concerned with the protection of ordinary people from
violent assault, burglaries and so on.</p>
<p>I emphasise the fact that it is not Labour members or people such
as myself who make such statements. On the BBC <em>Question Time</em>
programme on 16 October 1979 the following statement was made:</p>

<blockquote><em>&#8220;I think that from the police point of view that my
task in the future ... that basic crime as such &#8211; theft, burglary,
even violent crime &#8211; will not be the predominant police feature.</em></blockquote>

<blockquote><em>&#8220;What will be the matter of greatest concern to me
will be the covert and ultimately overt attempt to overthrow
democracy, to subvert the authority of the state, and, in fact, to
involve themselves in acts of sedition designed to destroy our
parliamentary system and the democratic government in this country.&#8221;</em></blockquote>

<p class="fst">Chief Constable Anderton of the Greater Manchester police force
said that. That is the real role and perspective of some chief police
officers. In reality, to the police sedition and subversion mean
attempts by working people to use their democratic and trade union
rights to defend themselves, their interests and the interests of
those whom they represent.</p>

<p>Recently, chief constables have resorted to the blanket use under
the Public Order Act 1936 of bans on demonstrations and general
street activity by trade unionists and the Labour movement. They have
done that on the pretext of attacking and banning fascist
organisations that have come on to the streets.</p>

<p>But there are similar bans against democratic organisations of the
Labour movement which have a far more serious effect on democracy.
However, on several occasions we have seen enormous numbers of police
officers being used to escort those Fascists, marching in small
numbers through the streets. Again, that is done in the name of
so-called democracy.</p>

<p>While chief constables and others pretend that everything is hunky
dory and that we have no problems, the police are being tooled up and
geared up to take on the working class in later events.</p>

<p>Recruits are advised to:</p>

<blockquote><em>&#8220;Watch out for people who, although not dishonest in
the ordinary sense, may, owing to extreme political views, intend to
harm the community you have sworn to protect.&#8221;</em></blockquote>

<p class="fst">The manual also states: <em>&#8220;While there are subtle differences
between these type of extremists and thieves, it is difficult to put
one&#8217;s finger on the material distinction.&#8221;</em> That is routine
policy in some sections of the police.</p>

<p>Some time ago, while travelling from Preston to London, I
overheard a conversation that perhaps I should not have heard between
a cadet at Hendon police academy and one of his friends.</p>

<p>He informed his friend that during one of their lectures a police
sergeant had told them that since the Americans had intervened in
Afghanistan, the working class of Britain would be out demonstrating
on the streets.</p>

<p>He said that the cadets were the protectors of law and order, that
there would be battles on the streets, and that the police should
prepare themselves for it. That is an example of the education in our
police establishments, which is preparing the democratic police for
events that will unfurl as time goes by.</p>

<p><em>Accountability and control will lead to the strengthening not
the diminution of democracy in Britain.</em></p>

<p>The nature of society and the motives of the Tories and the ruling
class are clearly characterised and put to the front in this Bill.
<em>The Bill contains draconian measures to stop, search and arrest;
it provides for detention for four days without charge; it provides
powers to search and fingerprint; and it provides for access to
personal files.</em></p>

<p>The Labour movement does not condone violence, but it condemns the
appalling counter-violence fostered by business interests through
films, television and the media.</p>

<p>Nor does the movement, while understanding the causes for crime,
support robbery as an individual way out of the problems that face
workers. We have no sympathy with the vicious criminals who are as
much a menace to the workers as are the big property owners, and
whose activities provide the state with excuses for strengthening
repressive powers.</p>

<p>However, the need to counter criminal activity does not give the
guardians of law the right to act as though they were above that law.
Fighting crime does not justify the harassment and ill-treatment of
suspects, or the denial of legal defence or the fabrication of
evidence against them.</p>
