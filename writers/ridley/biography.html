<h3>Biographical Note on F A Ridley </h3>
<hr class="end" /><p class="information"><span class="info">Source</span>: Dust-cover of his <em>Spartacus: The Leader of the Roman Slaves</em>.</p>
<p class="information">Born in February 1897  &#8211;  the year of Queen Victoria&#8217;s Diamond Jubilee!  &#8211;  F A Ridley failed the entrance examination to Oxford University and so joined Gibbon and Shelley in the ranks of the illustrious refugees from that institution. Subsequently, he received a theological education, which laid the foundations of his encyclopædic knowledge of Catholic theology and church history.</p>
<p class="information">After a short experience of business in the City of London, which left him with a lifelong conviction that all capitalists are crooks (actual or potential), F A Ridley settled down to his life work as a professional revolutionary.</p>
<p class="information">In the course of this work, he has debated with Harold Macmillan; helped in founding the Trotskyist movement, to be eventually excommunicated by Trotsky in person; and was mentioned by name in the Nazis&#8217; English Death List of 1940.</p>
<p class="information">A one-time member of the National Administrative Council of the Independent Labour Party, he was until recently President of the National Secular Society, fourth in succession to Charles Bradlaugh.</p>
<p class="information">F A Ridley, at 65, with 20 publications in the British Museum Library and some 2000 articles to his credit, mostly in the <em>Freethinker </em>and the <em>Socialist Leader</em>, is now on the threshold of a long and brilliant career, in the course of which he hopes to see translated into fact the multifarious advanced causes which he has championed in (comparative) obscurity for a generation.</p>
<p class="information">Perhaps it should be added that F A Ridley started his literary career as a pioneer of science fiction!</p>
