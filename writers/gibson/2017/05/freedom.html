<p class="fst">Rhiannon Giddens first made her name with the Carolina Chocolate
Drops, who played string-band music, heavily relying on the banjo and
fiddle. The band formed after the first Black Banjo Gathering in
North Carolina in 2005 and helped to reclaim a lost tradition of
African-American country music. Their music reached its peak in 2010
with the joyful sounds of &#8220;Genuine Negro Jig.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Freedom Highway</em> is Giddens&#8217; second solo album. Most of
the songs are written by her and tell of racist and sexual violence
from slavery and the Civil War through the Civil Rights Movement and
up to today. There is a brutal continuity in these experiences, &#8220;an
old, old song&#8221; as she describes it.</p>

<p>Two of the songs come from the Civil Rights Movement. The Staples
Singers&#8217; <em>Freedom Highway</em> is a driving song of determined
resistance, while Richard Farina&#8217;s <em>Birmingham Sunday</em>
poignantly describes the racist murder of four young black girls when
an Alabama church was bombed in 1963.</p>

<p>But the spirit of resistance imbues all of her own compositions as
well. &#8220;You can take my body ... but not my soul&#8221; she sings in <em>At
the Purchaser&#8217;s Option</em>, a story of babies sold into slavery.
There is optimism in <em>We Could Fly</em> with its soaring vocals
&#8220;searching for the promised land&#8221;.</p>

<p>By contrast the driving hip-hop influenced rhythms of <em>Better
Get It Right the First Time</em> describe a racist police killing like
that of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which sparked the Black
Lives Matter movement.</p>

<p>Her music remains rooted in the Piedmont blues style of North
Carolina, with the banjo and other acoustic stringed instruments
featuring prominently. It is augmented in some of these songs with
electric guitar, percussion and wind instruments too. Just as the
themes of the songs cover more than two centuries of the
African-American experience so the music has folk, blues, jazz, rap
and funk influences, all topped with Giddens&#8217;s amazing soprano voice.</p>

<p>Rhiannon Giddens has set out to create an album which speaks to
the need to resist in the US today. As the title track has it, &#8220;We&#8217;re
marching the freedom highway, and we&#8217;re not going to turn around.&#8221;
Giddens wrote about this track:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We cannot let hate divide us; we cannot let ignorance
diminish us; we cannot let those whose greed fills their every waking
hour take our country from us. They can&#8217;t take US from US â€”
unless we let them. I recorded this with Bhi Bhiman, all-American
singer-songwriter from St Louis, whose parents are from Sri Lanka.
America&#8217;s strength is her people, whether they came 4,000, 400 or
40 years ago, and we can&#8217;t leave anyone behind. Let&#8217;s walk down
Freedom Highway together.&#8221;</p>
