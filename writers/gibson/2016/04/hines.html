<p class="fst">Barry Hines was born into a mining family in Hoyland Common, a pit
village near Barnsley, in 1939. He qualified as a teacher and taught
in Barnsley secondary schools before becoming a full-time writer.
Hines&#8217;s work is characterised by his ear for dialogue, his
sympathetic use of Barnsley dialect and his identification with
working class struggles.</p>

<p>Hines sides with the downtrodden and revels in how they fight
back. His characters find humour in the bleakest of situations, from
youth unemployment in <strong>Looks and Smiles</strong> (1981) to class
conflict between the aristocracy and agricultural workers in <strong>The
Gamekeeper</strong> (1975).</p>

<p>Hoyland Common and the surrounding countryside figure in Hines&#8217;s
1968 novel <strong>A Kestrel for a Knave</strong> (filmed by Ken Loach as <em>Kes</em>
in 1969) and <strong>The Heart of It</strong> (1994). Those two novels plus <em>The
Price of Coal</em>, which was a two-part BBC play in 1977 (turned into
a novel in 1979), form a trilogy on miners and mining communities.</p>

<p><strong>A Kestrel for a Knave</strong> tells the story of Billy Casper,
about to leave his secondary modern school. He is bullied by his
miner brother and largely ignored by his mother. The education system
has failed him. As Billy comments about his teachers, &#8220;They&#8217;re
not bothered about us, just because we&#8217;re in 4C ... they talk to us
like muck.&#8221; Yet since he was young, Billy has been interested in
birds. His potential flowers as he trains a young kestrel. He teaches
himself from a falconry handbook, showing great perseverance and
skill. Yet at the end of the book there is little hope for Billy.</p>

<p><strong>The Price of Coal</strong> is set in a pit getting ready for a royal
visit, which then has a fatal disaster several weeks afterwards. It
was screened in the year of both the Silver Jubilee and the Labour
government&#8217;s plans to impose a divisive productivity scheme on the
National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). The novel takes sides on both
questions. Hines ridicules the preparations that management make to
get the pit ready for royalty. At the same time he shows the pressure
on management to increase production which leads to the fatal
explosion. The central character, Syd Storey, is opposed to the
visit, and highly critical of his NUM branch officials. He argues
that they are only getting the visit because their officials are &#8220;as
soft as shit and wouldn&#8217;t oppose it&#8221;. He, and the NUM officials
at militant neighbouring pits, are called extremists by Meakin, his
branch secretary. Syd replies that Meakin is trying &#8220;to discredit
anybody who&#8217;s not walking hand in glove with management ... who
puts the interests of the men first&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>The Heart of It</strong> develops that theme further. It spans the
mining industry from nationalisation to privatisation while
concentrating on the 1984&#8211;5 strike. It focuses on the Rickards
family. Harry Rickards was NUM branch secretary for 26 years and a
strike stalwart. He can barely speak, having had a stroke. Harry is a
lifelong Communist for whom the Russian Revolution felt like a &#8220;dawn
of hope and promise of a better world&#8221;. Harry&#8217;s estranged son
Karl returns home and starts to discover what his village endured
during the strike, from police riots to picket line violence. He
finds how the community organised to get through, including his
mother Maisie&#8217;s leading role in the Women&#8217;s Action Group.</p>

<p>Maisie&#8217;s funeral oration for her husband sums up the ongoing
spirit of resistance:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;All Harry wanted ... was a just society. And the
battle&#8217;s not over, not by a long chalk ... We might have lost the
strike [but we showed] what you can do when people work together ...
fighting for a cause.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Barry Hines knew which side he was on. He will be missed.</p>
