<p class="fst"><strong>Dare Devil Rides to Jarama</strong><br/>
<em>by Neil Gore</em></p>

<p class="fst">Townsend Productions&#8217; latest play tells the story of two
Communists &#8211; dirt track racer Clem &#8220;Dare Devil&#8221; Beckett and
intellectual Chris Caudwell. They join the International Brigades to
fight Franco&#8217;s fascists in Spain.</p>

<p>David Heywood and Neil Gore give virtuoso acting performances,
playing all the parts. All their work combines song with quick-fire
scenes with imaginative settings.</p>

<p>The songs of folk artist Ewan MacColl capture the spirit of young
Communists from Manchester in the early 1930s.</p>

<p>One of the most memorable songs tells the story of the 1932 Kinder
Scout Mass Trespass.</p>

<p>Thousands of protesters, including Clem, defied the landowners to
walk across the Derbyshire countryside.</p>

<p>The first act focuses on Clem as he tries to organise a dirt track
riders association to stand up to their unscrupulous bosses.</p>

<p>Blacklisted, he becomes a wall of death rider, and works at Fords
as a mechanic.</p>

<p>Clem volunteers to drive ambulances to Spain to support the
Republican side. Chris is a volunteer driver too.</p>

<p>The second act is all set in Spain from their arrival up to the
Battle of Jarama in 1937.</p>

<p>The second act is pacier than the first. It centres on exchanges
between the two comrades while they are stationed at the British
Battalion training camp.</p>

<p>Two contrasting characters, they are linked by their desire to
fight for a better world and crush the fascist uprising.</p>

<p>The spirit of resistance burns through everything they do and the play.</p>
