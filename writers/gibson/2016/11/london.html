<p class="fst"><strong>American novelist, journalist and socialist Jack London died
100 years ago. Dave Gibson outlines his passionate activism for
workers' rights and his political novels, as well as the
contradictions in his work.</strong></p>

<p class="fst">When Jack London died on 22 November 1916 he had been one of the
best known American socialists. His fame was built on both the
realism of his novels and his socialist journalism and public speaking.</p>

<p>By the time he joined the Oakland Socialist Labour Party in 1896
aged 20, he had been a sailor, a tramp, an oyster-pirate, had worked
in factories and had been jailed for 30 days as a vagrant. London
poured his experience of working ten-hour shifts in a cannery as a 15
year old into his short story <em>The Apostate</em>, which describes
how capitalism&#8217;s exploitation of child labour destroys both
childhood and the family. So powerful was it that it was reprinted as
a socialist pamphlet.</p>

<p>In 1901 London joined the Oakland branch of the newly-formed
Socialist Party and was twice the Socialist candidate for mayor.
Before then he had headed to the Klondike in the 1897 Gold Rush, an
experience which stimulated much of his writing, most famously the
novel <strong>Call of the Wild</strong>.</p>

<p>Then in 1902 he spent three months in London&#8217;s East End
researching what became <strong>The People of the Abyss</strong>, in which he
described &#8220;the economic degradation of the poor&#8221;. In one chapter
London describes walking with a carter and a carpenter, two men
physically broken by decades of hard work. He watches them &#8220;picking
up ... orange peel, apple skin ... stray crumbs of bread&#8221; which
they &#8220;chewed and swallowed ... in the heart of the ... wealthiest
and most powerful empire the world has ever seen.&#8221; The book is full
of such damning detail, backed up by thoroughly researched
statistical evidence of inequality and injustice explaining how the
capitalist system creates the poor and destitute.</p>

<p>Over the next few years the Socialist Party grew in size and
influence. In 1905 London both supported the Russian Revolution and
helped launch the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, touring the
country lecturing to students on socialism. He campaigned
successfully in 1906 for the dropping of the charges of conspiracy to
murder against Big Bill Haywood and two other leaders of the Western
Federation of Miners. His article <em>Something Rotten in Idaho</em>
rips into the real conspiracy &#8211; that perpetrated by the mine-owners
and the state legal machine against Haywood and his comrades.</p>

<p>His most political novel, <strong>The Iron Heel</strong>, was published in
1908. It describes how an oligarchy of American capitalists called
the Iron Heel crush trade union and socialist resistance between 1912
and 1932. As one of the capitalists says, &#8220;We will grind you
revolutionists down under our heel ... the world is ours ... and ours
it will remain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The main text purports to be a manuscript written by one of the
early 20th century revolutionaries and found four centuries after
&#8220;the final triumph of socialist democracy&#8221;. In 1937 Trotsky wrote
of the novel, &#8220;London is an optimist ... a penetrating and
farsighted one,&#8221; because the terrible defeat described in the novel
is met by continued resistance and ultimate victory. The novel
dramatises both the debate between reform and revolution and the rise
of fascism.</p>
<p>The main hero, Ernest Everhard, swings from hoping &#8220;for a
peaceable victory at the ballot box&#8221; to recognising the need for
the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism. He is unable to convince
the bulk of socialist leaders of this argument and the forces of the
Iron Heel crush democracy and the forces of socialism.</p>

<p>Everhard&#8217;s shift mirrors that of London. He learnt from the
suppression of the 1905 Russian Revolution the ruthlessness of the
ruling class. He later wrote, &#8220;History shows that no master class
is ever willing to let go without a quarrel&#8221; and will use
governments, armies and militias to keep power. He opposed the
growing reformist tendencies in the Socialist Party.</p>

<p>There are major weaknesses in his thinking and writing. He clung
to white supremacist ideas through most of his life, frequently being
openly racist, both in his novels and in articles. Yet in his
oft-quoted 1905 speech, <em>Revolution</em>, he could say, &#8220;The
comradeship of the revolutionists passes over geographical lines
[and] transcends race prejudice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Similar contradictions occur elsewhere in his thinking. He
initially welcomed the 1911 Mexican Revolution writing to the &#8220;dear
brave [Mexican] comrades&#8221; &#8220;we ... are with you heart and soul in
your efforts to overthrow slavery and autocracy.&#8221; His short story
<em>The Mexican</em> captures that spirit of solidarity. But by 1914 he
backed American aggression against Mexico. In 1913 London wrote,
&#8220;Down with the army and the navy. We don&#8217;t need killing institutions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Socialist Party opposed the First World War as &#8220;a bloody and
senseless conflict&#8221; caused by &#8220;imperialist and commercial
rivalries,&#8221; and this view was confirmed in a September 1915
membership ballot. Yet London was enraged by this and supported the
Allies&#8217; war against Germany. Subsequently, in March 1916 he
resigned from the Socialist Party and died months later aged just 40.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding deep flaws in his thinking, the best of his
writing &#8211; whether describing the evils of capitalist society or
resistance to it &#8211; is still worth socialists reading.</p>
