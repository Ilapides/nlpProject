<p class="fst"><strong>A Raisin in the Sun</strong><br />
<em>Directed by Dawn Walton</em></p>

<p class="fst"><em>A Raisin in the Sun</em> is set in the 1950s US in an overcrowded apartment in Chicago&#8217;s Southside. It&#8217;s based around the five members of the tight-knit black Younger family.</p>

<p>The play made a huge impact when it was written by Lorraine Hansberry in 1959.</p>

<p>The Eclipse Theatre company&#8217;s revival is a powerful take on Hansberry&#8217;s drama. It shows racism blighting the Youngers&#8217; lives &#8211; and black people standing up to it.</p>

<p>Angela Wynter gives a convincing performance as the mother Lena Younger, as does Susan Wokoma as her student daughter Beneatha.</p>

<p>It begins with Lena waiting for a $10,000 insurance cheque after her late husband&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>Beneatha aspires to be a doctor and her brother Walter wants to be a businessman.</p>

<p>But Walter&#8217;s ambition clashes with his mother&#8217;s dream of buying a new family home, because both depend on the insurance cheque.</p>

<p>The tension ratchets up when Lena puts a deposit on a house in Clybourne Park, an all-white area.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Threats</h4>

<p class="fst">A white representative from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association tries to persuade the family not to move in by using bribery and racist threats.</p>

<p>Lena gives Walter control of the rest of the money, while telling him what she wants him to do with it. The resulting tensions threaten to rip the family apart.</p>

<p>Political ideas also fizz through the play. Beneatha is inspired by her African heritage and African liberation struggles, and wrestles with ideas of identity.</p>

<p>She cuts off what her Nigerian boyfriend Asagai calls her &#8220;mutilated hair&#8221; to leave it close-cropped and unstraightened.</p>

<p>Beneatha resists what she calls the &#8220;dominant&#8221; and &#8220;oppressive culture&#8221; of White America. And she challenges the sexism of the men around her.</p>

<p>The title comes from Langston Hughes&#8217; poem <em>A Dream Deferred</em>.</p>

<p>He asks, &#8220;What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or does it explode?&#8221;</p>

<p>All the adult Youngers dream of a better life for the family.</p>

<p>This production brings out how their struggles to achieve those dreams clash with the exploitation and racism of US society.</p>
