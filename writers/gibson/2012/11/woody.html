<p class="fst"><strong>Woody Guthrie was born on 14 July 1912 in Okemah, Oklahoma. He
died in 1967 in relative obscurity, having been hospitalised for the
last 15 years of his life. Yet his music continues to be an
inspiration for musicians from Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen to
Billy Bragg. The centenary of his birth has seen a flurry of new
books, CDs and concerts celebrating his music.</strong></p>

<p>His songs attack poverty, racism, fascism (he had a sticker on his
guitar saying &#8220;This machine kills fascists&#8221;) and the system that
creates such evils. His songs are on the side of workers, which is
why, in a world still ravaged with the same problems, his music
retains such power.</p>

<p>Perhaps his most famous song is <em>This Land is Your Land</em>,
written originally as a riposte to the patriotic song <em>God Bless
America</em>. Ironically it is often taken to be patriotic and is
frequently sung with three of its original verses missing &#8211; the
verses attacking private property and hunger.</p>

<p>But <em>This Land is Your Land</em> still has the power to anger the
right. When Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen sang it at Obama&#8217;s
inauguration concert in January 2009 the then Fox News commentator
Glenn Beck fulminated that it &#8220;is a song about a progressive utopia
with no ownership of property&#8221;. Tom Morello sang the full version
to a strike rally in Wisconsin last year, calling it &#8220;a
revolutionary class-war anthem&#8221;.</p>

<p>Guthrie moved to California in 1937, following hundreds of
thousands of his fellow &#8220;dust bowl&#8221; refugees from Oklahoma. They
were fleeing drought and destitution, hoping for a better life.
Instead they were faced with police violence, brutal exploitation and
appalling living conditions.</p>

<p>When Guthrie got his own radio show in Los Angeles he started
writing songs about how the Okies (as the refugees were labelled)
were treated. By 1938 Woody had made contact with the Communist Party
(CP). He was impressed by the way they supported the Californian
agricultural workers&#8217; struggles. He performed at strike benefits
and CP events, delivering food relief to strikers and writing a
regular column for the communist press.</p>

<p>In 1940 he moved to New York. He maintained his support for the CP
during the Cold War and the McCarthy anti-communist witch-hunts
because &#8220;the Communists have always been the hardest fighters for
the trade unions and equal rights for every person of every colour&#8221;.</p>

<p>That year his <em>Dustbowl Ballads</em> album was released,
which included songs like <em>Tom Joad</em>, which retells the story of
<strong>The Grapes of Wrath</strong>, John Steinbeck&#8217;s classic novel about
Californian migrants. In 1941 he joined the Almanac Singers and went
on a nationwide tour singing to strike rallies and local unions. When
the US joined the Second World War the Almanac Singers threw
themselves into producing anti-fascist songs.</p>
<p>As well as singing about contemporary experiences, Woody sang
about powerful episodes from working class history. For instance, the
song Ludlow Massacre tells the story of a 1914 miners&#8217; strike in
Ludlow, Colorado, which was brutally attacked by state troopers who
killed 13 children. The song tells how the miners fought back, and
ends with the line:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I said &#8216;God Bless the Mineworkers Union&#8217;&nbsp;/
And then I hung my head and cried&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">For a time Guthrie was openly racist on his Californian radio
show, until challenged by a black listener. His ideas changed
dramatically from then on.</p>

<p>In 1946 a black Pacific War veteran, Isaac Woodard, tried to use a
whites-only toilet in South Carolina. He was so savagely beaten he
lost his sight. There was a New York benefit concert with Count
Basie, Billie Holiday and others including Guthrie. Guthrie&#8217;s song
told Woodward&#8217;s story:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I thought I fought on the islands to get
rid of their kind&nbsp;/ But I can see the fight lots plainer now
that I am blind&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">In January 1948 he read a newspaper report of a plane crash in
California in which 28 Mexican deportees (who had been working in the
same fields the Okies had ten years before) were killed alongside
three white crew. The crew were all named but the Mexicans were just
labelled deportees. He exploded with anger and wrote the song
<em>Deportee</em>. Its chorus runs:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita,&nbsp;/ Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria&nbsp;/ You won&#8217;t have a name when you ride the big airplane&nbsp;/ All they will call you is deportees&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">Guthrie&#8217;s attacks on capitalism, expressed brilliantly in his
music, remain as fresh and relevant today as when he first wrote them.</p>
