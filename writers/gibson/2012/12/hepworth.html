<p class="fst">This exhibition of more than 30 of Barbara Hepworth&#8217;s <em>Hospital
Drawings</em> is the first time that so many of these powerful pieces
have been shown together. She drew them between 1947 and 1949, during
the birth of the NHS, having been allowed into several operating
theatres as an observer.</p>

<p>During the Second World War Hepworth and her family lived in St
Ives, Cornwall. Her daughter fell ill with osteomyelitis and required
extensive hospital care which Hepworth and her partner struggled to
afford. The chance to observe in operating theatres came out of the
friendship that developed between her daughter&#8217;s surgeon and
herself.</p>

<p>Hepworth is most famous for her abstract sculptures, but these
drawings have recognisable people in them as they focus on surgeons
and nurses at work. However, she concentrates just on their eyes and
hands; the rest of their bodies are covered in face masks, caps and
gowns which give them a smooth flowing, almost sculptural, quality.
Their gracefulness is emphasised, until they become almost spiritual figures.</p>

<p>Many of the drawings are in oil and pencil, but with washed oil
that softens boundaries and blends one person into another.</p>

<p>Her interest is in the collective work effort: most of the
drawings highlight a group totally absorbed in a particular operation
&#8211; whether it is a surgeon with implements in hand, or a nurse
poised to intervene. The implements she focuses on range from
scalpels to hammers and chisels, which emphasise the link with the
way a sculptor works. Hepworth commented in a lecture to surgeons,
&#8220;There is a very close affinity between the work of surgeons and
sculptors.&#8221;</p>

<p>She goes on to say that in her view &#8220;the medical profession, as
a whole, seeks to restore and maintain the beauty and grace of the
human mind and body.&#8221;</p>

<p>That comes through strongly in her drawings. The medical staff&#8217;s
hands are delicate but strong, their eyes full of understanding and
compassion. Their only concern is the restoration to full health of
the patient in front of them.</p>

<p>The drawings convey a collective, intense desire to heal, and to
improve people&#8217;s quality of life. The hammer and chisel are life
enhancing, not threatening.</p>

<p>These drawings celebrate the creativity and dedication of groups
of professional workers. Their motivation is clearly to help others,
not to make money. They are the values that underpinned the
development of a free health service.</p>

<p>Hepworth&#8217;s personal experiences and socialist values led her to
welcome the setting up of the NHS &#8211; but these drawings are not NHS
propaganda. They are a tribute to human endeavour.</p>

<p>It is ironic that in the week this exhibition opened in Wakefield
the medical secretaries and other clerical workers at the local
hospital began a campaign of strike action against redundancies and
pay cuts caused by the government&#8217;s attempts to destroy that free
health service.</p>

<p class="fst"><em><strong>Barbara Hepworth: The Hospital Drawings</strong> is on at The
Hepworth Gallery, Wakefield until 3 February 2013</em></p>
