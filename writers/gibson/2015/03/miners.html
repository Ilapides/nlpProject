<h4>*</h4>

<p class="fst">Barnsley graphic designer Craig Oldham has produced a powerful and
stimulating record of the 1984&#8211;85 Miners&#8217; Strike.</p>

<p>His book tells the strike&#8217;s story by grouping together
fascinating photographs and examples of graffiti, cartoons, posters,
badges and record sleeves from the time.</p>

<p>Craig is from a striking mining family, and part of the book&#8217;s
power comes from that personal involvement.</p>

<p>His Battle of Orgreave section doesn&#8217;t just discuss the
importance of John Harris&#8217;s famous photograph of a mounted
policeman swinging his baton at a Women Against Pit Closures (WAPC)
activist. It also includes a photo of his dad being arrested there.</p>

<p>The thoughts of Craig&#8217;s mother and miner grandfather about the
strike sit alongside those of left wing filmmaker Ken Loach and
artist Jeremy Deller.</p>

<p>The book takes its title from words on one of many black rosettes
that WAPC members left on the steps of 10 Downing Street during a
national demonstration in August 1984.</p>

<p>The rosettes dramatically symbolise Tory prime minister Margaret
Thatcher&#8217;s desire to destroy the National Union of Mineworkers
(NUM) and the mining industry. 
</p>
<p>Even the book&#8217;s black dust jacket emphasises that point. It&#8217;s
made out of coal-dust from the muck stack at Barnsley Main Colliery.</p>

<p>The book contains many evocative images. They range from the
poster of The Clash&#8217;s Scargill&#8217;s Christmas Party gig at the
Brixton Academy to the union banners designed by Andrew Turner and Ed Hall.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Disturbing</strong></h4>

<p class="fst">Turner&#8217;s disturbing banner for North Selby NUM and Hall&#8217;s
uplifting one for the Unite union&#8217;s South Yorkshire community
branch are both beautifully reproduced.</p>

<p>A personal favourite &#8211; and one I had never seen before &#8211; is a
poster for the Normanton and Altofts Miners Support group.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s entitled <em>A&#8211;Z of a Miner&#8217;s Wife</em>, starting at
&#8220;Arthur forever&#8221; and finishing with &#8220;Zip it up MacGregor.
We&#8217;ll never give in.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was delighted to see Craig paying tribute to Paul Morton,
another political Barnsley graphic designer.</p>

<p>Paul&#8217;s <em>Support The Miners Cards</em> for the radical Leeds
Postcards company raised over £30,000 for the strike fund. I still
have one on my pin board where it has been for the last 30 years.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most powerful section is the one exploring the
strike&#8217;s graffiti.</p>

<p>There is the humour of the miners defending the NUM HQ wearing toy
police helmets emblazoned with &#8220;NUM Snatch Squad&#8221;.</p>

<p>And there is the raw anger caught in the picture of the march back
to work at the end of the strike at Armthorpe colliery in Doncaster.</p>

<p>It shows miners and their supporters marching past a wall
emblazoned with a hangman&#8217;s noose and the slogan &#8220;We Won&#8217;t
Forget The Scabs.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is a beautifully produced book. Buy it &#8211; or if you can&#8217;t
afford it, demand your local library gets a copy.</p>
