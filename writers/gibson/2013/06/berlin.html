<p class="fst">Hans Fallada&#8217;s 1947 novel <strong>Alone in Berlin</strong> is set in the
German capital during the Second World War. It tells the intertwined
stories of families living in an apartment block and trying to cope
with the Nazis&#8217; terror regime. Fallada shows ordinary people both
resisting the Nazis and working for them, in a myriad of different ways.</p>

<p>The couple at the centre of the novel, Otto and Anna Quangel, are
grief-stricken by their son&#8217;s death while fighting in France, and
their grief quickly turns to determined resistance to the regime.
Every week they produce postcards displaying anti-Nazi slogans and
over a two-year period distribute them around the city in office
stairwells. Their resistance is strengthened by the mistreatment of a
Jewish neighbour and by dislike of the Nazi family who live on the
floor above.</p>

<p>Alongside the Quangels&#8217; story Fallada tells that of the Gestapo
police inspector trying to hunt them down. The terror is all
consuming. Not just the hunted, but some of the hunters, and those
who seek to profit from the Nazi persecution of working people, are
destroyed. Yet however terrifying the state terror apparatus is,
Fallada extracts dark humour from its frequent, blundering and myopic failures.</p>

<p>Throughout the novel, despite the huge network of police spies and
Nazi agents, there are examples of individuals looking for ways to
fight back. We see, among others, members of an opposition factory
cell, a widowed shopkeeper, a retired judge and a Christian
technician make brave stands against tyranny.</p>

<p>Otto is a foreman in a furniture factory which &#8220;ironically&#8221;
has been converted to coffin manufacturing. At one point the
omniscient narrator tells us that &#8220;there is not one among the 80
men [present on Otto&#8217;s shift] who has not in some way opposed the
present government&#8221;. Yet the impact of the terror is such that most
individuals feel isolated and act alone.</p>

<p>Worse still, the widespread fear limits the effect of any
rebellion. Most of the Quangels&#8217; postcards are handed in to the
authorities by people terrified of being implicated themselves. The
narrator shows us a doctor in just such a state, yet significantly
his fear stems from hoping that his own act of defiance will remain concealed.</p>

<p>Fallada is unsparing in his portrait of Nazi brutality and how
they break resistance with violence and interrogation. There is an
inevitability to the failure of resistance.</p>

<p>But the novel celebrates that resistance. As one character says:
&#8220;We all acted alone, we were caught alone, and ... will ... die
alone. But that doesn&#8217;t mean we are alone or ... our deaths will be
in vain.&#8221; There is hope in that, and in the fact that &#8220;at least
you opposed evil&#8221;.</p>

<p>There is further hope in the portrayal of the central characters,
both in their determination to hit back against Nazi tyranny, and the
way that resistance strengthens and changes them. A supreme moment
demonstrating this is when Otto laughs in the face of a brutal Nazi
judge, defying the worst the system can throw at him.</p>

<p>Fallada uses the narrator to tell us that the novel is dedicated
to &#8220;invincible life ... triumphing over humiliation and tears, over
misery and death&#8221;. The book is both a chilling portrayal of the
triumph of barbarism and a tribute to the anti-Nazi resistance of
many ordinary Germans.</p>
