<p class="fst"><strong>Exhibition &#8211; Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Until 2 November</strong></p>

<p class="fst">Some 25 years after the Tiananmen Square democracy protests,
Yorkshire Sculpture Park is staging an exhibition by dissident
Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. In his words, &#8220;Freedom of speech ... is
the very essence of human rights&#8221;, and his work explores freedom
and its restriction in capitalist societies.</p>

<p>The park is in the grounds of Bretton Hall, and this exhibition is
showing in its newly restored 18th century chapel.</p>

<p>Because Ai Weiwei&#8217;s personal freedom is so restricted by the
Chinese state, he had to communicate how he wanted to use the chapel
space by email. He has filled the main part with nine rows of five
antique Qing dynasty chairs, all facing in the same direction, in
regimented order. Each chair is isolated from its neighbours. We are
invited to sit on one and think freely.</p>

<p>The setting evokes separation and limited opportunities of
movement but also creates the spirit of the group and also the
importance of the individual within it.</p>

<p>As a printed quotation from the artist says, &#8220;Creativity is the
power to act [and] only through our actions can our expectations for
change turn into reality.&#8221;</p>

<p>Similar themes recur in his 2008 <em>Map of China</em> sculpture.
Made of wood, its height emphasises China&#8217;s long history. It
comprises many separate, distinctively grained pieces of wood
elaborately interlocked to make a unified whole &#8211; just like China
is a mosaic of fragments of cultural and ethnic diversity. But the
flat smooth surface suggests how the Chinese state has tried to
suppress this diversity.</p>

<p>Another exhibit is a delicate porcelain sculpture from 2012 called
<em>Ruyi</em> (meaning &#8220;as one wishes&#8221;) which reworks an ancient
Chinese idea of a ritual sceptre giving the right to speak.</p>

<p>But this <em>ruyi</em> is contained in glass, is fragile and
comprises, in part, human organs with severed arteries. The symbolism
is clear but there are also dragon elements within the sculpture
which encapsulate the potential power of unified action.</p>

<p>Outside the gallery is the most striking of all Ai Weiwei&#8217;s
works here. His six metre tall <em>Iron Tree</em> is made up of 97 iron
castings of pieces from different parts of trees, visibly bolted
together and already rusting. It is both jointed and disjointed.</p>

<p>It looks like wood and feels like iron. There is both the power of
nature and people&#8217;s collective power to transform nature symbolised
here. It evokes Frankenstein&#8217;s creature, as a thing of strange
beauty to be admired rather than a monster to be despised.</p>

<p>As Ai Weiwei has said, &#8220;Creativity is the power to reject the
past, to change the status quo and to seek new potential.&#8221;</p>
