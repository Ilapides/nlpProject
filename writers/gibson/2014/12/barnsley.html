<p class="fst">The sight of militant pensioners and disabled people wearing
Freedom Rider T-shirts while noisily protesting is now commonplace
across South Yorkshire.</p>

<p>For the last nine months the South Yorkshire Freedom Riders have
been fighting to get free train travel reinstated for older and
disabled people.</p>

<p>The Labour-dominated South Yorkshire Passenger Transport
Executive&#8217;s (SYPTE) decision to axe free travel from 31 March 2014
because of Tory spending cuts, and to do so with extremely limited
public consultation, provoked a storm of outrage.</p>

<p>Over 300 people came to the first Barnsley protest meeting.</p>

<p>That led to what became the South Yorkshire Freedom Riders,
uniting older and disabled people, starting a campaign of
demonstrations on the streets and inside Barnsley Transport
Interchange, and of going on Freedom Rides &#8211; travelling by train
and refusing to pay.</p>

<p>From the beginning the campaign sought trade union support. On the
second Freedom Ride the train driver put campaigners in touch with
Aslef who have been a mainstay of support ever since.</p>

<p>The bakers&#8217; union produced the campaign banner, while the South
Yorkshire Unite Community branch has given tremendous backing
throughout. Union donations keep flowing in.</p>

<p>This connection has been a two-way process with Freedom Riders
joining an RMT demonstration and supporting their campaign to keep
guards on trains, and joining the March for the NHS when it came
through Barnsley.</p>

<p>Labour reacted in two ways: by looking to make concessions which
they hoped would divide the protest movement and by attacking the
very idea of protest.</p>

<p>The Barnsley Central MP, Dan Jarvis, shadow justice minister,
denounced the protesters as lawbreakers whose actions were making a
settlement harder. Yet on the streets campaigners got strong public
backing for the protests.</p>

<p>Meanwhile from early June Labour reinstated full rights to free
train travel for disabled people, with older people getting half
fares on some journeys. This divisive proposal was unanimously
rejected by the Freedom Riders at a mass campaign rally in Barnsley&#8217;s
main square. Both older and disabled protesters resolved to fight on together.</p>

<p>From that point on the Freedom Rides were met much more
aggressively by Northern Rail and the Transport Police. The crunch
came on 23 June when about 60 Freedom Riders were kettled by
transport police at Sheffield station, with two pensioners arrested
and charged with obstructing the police and not having a valid ticket
for travel. Their trial, scheduled to last five days, starts at
Sheffield Magistrates Court on Monday 8 December.</p>

<p>Campaigners hope that the trial and demonstration will mark the
beginning of a new phase of mass militant protest.</p>

<p>The South Yorkshire experience, whatever the outcome, shows what
pensioners can achieve by militant collective action. That lesson is
likely to be invaluable in the struggles to come.</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Update: The case against the Barnsley Freedom Riders was
dropped by the Crown Prosecution Services on Friday 28 November.</em></p>
