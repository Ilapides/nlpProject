<p class="fst"><strong>This month marks the centenary of the Ludlow Massacre when US
national guardsmen killed 20 striking miners and their families in
Colorado. This is the story of one of the most violent episodes in
American labour history.</strong></p>

<p>On 20 April 1914 the US National Guard attacked a tent colony of
striking miners at Ludlow in Southern Colorado. By the end of the day
at least 20 strikers, their wives and children were dead. Thirteen
had died in a pit dug underneath a tent where they were sheltering
from the gunfire after the militiamen deliberately set fire to the tents.</p>

<p>Louis Tikas, a strike leader of Greek origin, and two other
strikers were murdered in cold blood after they were summoned to a
&#8220;negotiation&#8221; by Lieutenant Linderfelt of the National Guard.
Linderfelt knocked out the unarmed Tikas by breaking his rifle butt
over his skull and then ordered the shooting.</p>

<p>An eyewitness was reported in the <strong>New York World</strong> as saying,
&#8220;The militiamen aimed their rifles and fired into the unconscious
man's body. It was the first murder I had ever seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>This slaughter, better known as the Ludlow Massacre, was the most
violent incident in a 14-month long strike of 11,000 coal miners in
Southern Colorado. The US labour historian Howard Zinn described the
strike as &#8220;one of the most dramatic and violent examples of class
conflict in American history&#8221;.</p>

<p>At least 75 people died in the strike. The strikers, members of
the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), were pitted against the
richest man in the world, John D Rockefeller Jr, who owned the
largest mining company, the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CFIC).</p>
<p>The miners had many grievances which fuelled the strike. The
Southern Colorado coalfield had the worst safety record in the world.
Rockefeller was vehemently anti-union and in 1912 alone over 1,000
miners were sacked as suspected union members.</p>

<p>Rockefeller had deliberately imported foreign labour to ensure a
mixture of nationalities at every mine in an attempt to keep the
miners divided. In a speech to a union conference in September 1913
the veteran UMWA organiser Mother Jones quoted a CFIC mine manager as
saying, &#8220;Dagos are cheaper than props,&#8221; in dismissing criticisms
of the company's safety record. She commented, &#8220;There are no dagos
in this country. It is the game that has been played down the history
of the ruling class to divide the working class.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most of the miners lived in what were effectively feudal mine
camps where the company owned everything. The mine superintendent was
mayor and outsiders were denied entrance. The company owned the shops
and saloons and appointed the marshal. Mine guards were employed to
control the miners. They controlled state and sheriff elections too.
CFIC Colorado manager L.M. Bowers described his company as &#8220;the
political dictator of Southern Colorado&#8221;.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Machine Guns</h4>

<p class="fst">While UMWA officials sought a negotiated settlement prior to the
strike, the coal operators prepared for war. They paid for hundreds
of gunmen and detectives of the Baldwin-Felts Agency to be deputised
and brought in up to 20 machine guns. Detectives from the agency shot
dead a UMWA organiser, Gerald Lippiatt, in Trinidad, the main town in
the mining area.</p>

<p>The 11,000 miners walked out on 23 September 1913 demanding union
recognition, an eight hour day, a 10 percent pay rise and, most
significantly, for the state mining laws to be enforced in the
Southern Colorado mines. The miners and their families moved into
giant tent colonies as the coal operators would evict them from the
company camps. Ludlow was the biggest with 1,200 people living there.</p>
<p>The unity and resolve of the miners were unbreakable despite every
effort of the coal operators and their hired guns, who even paid for
an armoured vehicle, nicknamed the &#8220;Death Special&#8221; to shoot up
tent colonies with machine guns. The first time it was used one boy
was hit nine times in the leg and a striker was killed. The miners
fought back with what few arms they had.</p>

<p>Bowers agitated for the National Guard to be called in. He told
Rockefeller he had got the backing of &#8220;all the bankers of the city
... the chamber of commerce, the real estate exchange, a great many
of the best businessmen ... [backed by] 14 of the editors of the most
important newspapers in the state.&#8221; That was sufficient to force
the state governor to do as Bowers wished.</p>

<p>The miners believed that the National Guard would be neutral. They
were quickly disillusioned. The commanding officer, General Chase,
drove around in a CFIC vehicle. He created what he called the
&#8220;military district of Colorado&#8221; arresting hundreds of miners and
their wives. Mother Jones was held without charge for months.</p>
<p>The coal operators had hoped that the arrival of the National
Guard would break the resolve of the strikers. When this failed they
agitated for the National Guard to oversee the mass importation of
scab labour. Eventually the governor agreed, so trainloads of strike
breakers started arriving, protected by the National Guard, so much
so that the women taunted them, calling them &#8220;scab herders&#8221;.</p>

<p>These men did not know they were to be used as strike breakers
until they arrived at Ludlow rail junction. Some who protested were
killed. They were held prisoner by armed guards in the mine camps.
Those who did manage to escape found refuge in the tent colonies.</p>

<p>The salaries of the guardsmen were effectively being paid by the
coal operators. As the money dried up most of the guards were
recalled at the end of March, leaving just three companies, made up
primarily of mine-guards and agency detectives. The company at Ludlow
was commanded by Lieutenant Linderfelt, a man who had established his
brutal credentials in November when he savagely attacked Louis Tikas
and had him jailed.</p>

<p>The attack on the Ludlow tent colony began early on 20 April.
Three machine guns fired into the tents, backed up by 400 armed men.
The miners fought back as best they could with the limited arms
available to them but could not stop the onslaught.</p>

<p>Union railwaymen refused to transport National Guard
reinforcements to Ludlow in the form of an armoured train until
eventually a scab crew was found. The colony was burnt to the ground
and it was not until the fires were put out the following day that
the 13 dead were found beneath the tents.</p>

<p>A conservative newspaper, the <strong>Rocky Mountain News</strong>,
commented, &#8220;Machine guns did the murder. It was private war, with
the wealth of the richest man in the world behind the armed guards.&#8221;
The <strong>New York Times</strong> said, &#8220;No situation can justify the acts
of the militia&#8221; and fretted that their blunder would give
justification to whatever the miners did in response.</p>

<p>The brutality of the massacre sent shockwaves through the American
working class. The striking miners were enraged and armed men from
other tent colonies poured into the Ludlow area, attacking the
working mines, driving off the guards and dynamiting them. They were
backed by other local workers taking up arms, including clerks and
teachers. Railway workers continued to refuse to transport troops and
ammunition to Ludlow.</p>

<p>In Wyoming 1,700 miners took up arms and told the UMWA they were
ready to go to Ludlow, while in Cripple Creek 500 miners headed for
Ludlow. The Denver Cigar Makers Union voted to send 500 armed men.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Demonstrators</h4>

<p class="fst">Solidarity donations poured into Ludlow. From September 1913 to
April 1914 $8,700 had been donated; in the three weeks following the
massacre this rose to $80,000. In Denver 5,000 demonstrated to demand
that the National Guard officers be put on trial for murder and
branded the governor as an accessory. Demonstrators hounded
Rockefeller in New York.</p>

<p>A group of 82 guardsmen mutinied in Denver and refused to board a
troop train bound for Ludlow because they did not want to kill women
and children. Eugene Debs, leader of the US Socialist Party, said;
&#8220;The shots fired at Ludlow ... will prove the signal for the
American revolution.&#8221; Debs, who had received over 900,000 votes in
the US presidential elections two years earlier, called for the
setting up of a Gunmen&#8217;s Defence Fund to ensure that the strikers
had the firepower to match that of the guards.</p>

<p>UMWA locals all over the country demanded the union call a
national strike. Such a strike could have had huge support, have
sparked widespread solidarity strikes and the coal operators could
have been beaten. But UMWA officials argued that the best way to
support the strike was to stay at work.</p>

<p>When President Wilson sent in federal troops nine days after the
massacre union officials effectively stopped resistance. The strike
was not finally called off until December but it had been beaten when
the national union leaders failed to escalate the strike.</p>

<p>The Ludlow Massacre showed that the US ruling class was willing to
use any means to defeat workers (it would enter the First World War
three years later in the name of &#8220;democracy&#8221; and &#8220;freedom&#8221;).
But the Ludlow strike also shows that America&#8217;s rulers were not all powerful.</p>

<p>If the bravery of the 11,000 strikers and their families fighting
the richest man in the world and his private army had been matched by
bravery from their union leaders this could have been a famous
working class victory. As it was, it took another generation before
the Southern Colorado coalfield was finally unionised.</p>
