<p class="fst">Pete Seeger died in January aged 94. His life was dedicated to
making music for left wing progressive movements. He was a principled
brave musician who always stood by his beliefs, whatever the cost.</p>

<p>Seeger composed famous protest songs like <em>If I Had a Hammer</em>
and helped make <em>We Shall Overcome</em> an anthem of the civil
rights movement. He sang at the 2012 Occupy Wall Street protest just
like he had at anti Vietnam War and civil rights rallies.</p>

<p>When he was 17, Seeger went with his Communist father to hear
Bascom Lamar Lunsford play the 5-string banjo at a folk festival.
From that point on he adopted the instrument. He spent more time
playing the banjo than studying and he joined the Young Communist
League, dropping out of Harvard University.</p>

<p>His musical activism started in 1939 when he joined the Vagabond
Puppeteers&#8217; tour of upstate New York. They performed at picket
lines of the Dairy Farmers&#8217; Union who were striking for better
prices from milk wholesalers.</p>

<p>A defining moment in Seeger&#8217;s life came in 1940 when he played a
&#8220;Grapes of Wrath&#8221; benefit concert in New York for Californian
migrant workers. Also on the bill was Woody Guthrie and before long
Seeger was travelling west with Guthrie, singing at strike rallies
and learning his music craft.</p>

<p>Seeger learned fast and by 1941 he had set up the Almanac Singers,
which Guthrie joined later. It was a musical collective, where they
attempted to build the movement in the spirit of John L. Lewis,
leader of the United Mineworkers, who said &#8220;A singing army is a
winning army&#8221;.</p>

<p>Their first album, <em>Songs for John Doe</em>, was anti-war at a
time when the Communist Party was anti-war because of the
Stalin-Hitler pact. Their second, <em>Talking Union</em>, supported the
industrial struggle. When Hitler invaded the Soviet Union they
rapidly reversed their positions, becoming pro-war and anti-strikes.
But despite this U-turn the Almanacs were blacklisted because of
their earlier positions.</p>

<p>For the following 25 years Seeger was a victim of the
anti-Communist witch-hunt whipped up in the US. His next band, The
Weavers, disbanded in 1952 (after selling 4 million records in 1950)
because they were blacklisted and hounded by FBI agents. Their
recording of <em>Rock Island Line</em> was even investigated for
sedition by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee.</p>

<p>The witch-hunt peaked in September 1949 when racist gangs attacked
a Paul Robeson concert at Peekskill, near New York. At the concert
Seeger gave one of the earliest performances of <em>If I Had a Hammer</em>.
As he drove home with his family the police diverted all traffic down
a narrow high-sided road into a violent ambush by a racist mob. The
Seegers&#8217; car windows were smashed by rocks.</p>

<p>Seeger was called in front of the House Un-American Activities
Committee in 1955. He refused to answer any questions. He was held in
contempt but it was another six years before he was sentenced to a
year&#8217;s imprisonment. The sentence was later overturned on appeal.
Throughout those years his freedom of movement was restricted.</p>

<p>He was blacklisted from TV until 1967 when he was invited onto the
nationally networked <em>Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour</em>. Even then
CBS edited out his anti-Vietnam War song.</p>

<p>State repression did not stop his activism. He helped transform <em>We
Shall Overcome</em> from a union song into one that Martin Luther King
described as a &#8220;song that haunts you&#8221;. It became for a time the
anthem of the civil rights movement.</p>

<p>But Seeger&#8217;s music was also criticised from the left. Malcolm X
said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not one who goes for <em>We Shall Overcome</em> ... If
you&#8217;re going to get yourself a .45 and start singing <em>We Shall
Overcome</em>, I&#8217;m with you.&#8221; Writer Lillian Hellman called it
&#8220;namby-pamby, wishy-washy&#8221;. By comparison to the political
toughness of Dylan&#8217;s <em>Times They Are A&#8217;Changing</em> album, much
of Seeger&#8217;s music appeared soft and liberal.</p>

<p>Similar criticisms had been raised of Seeger since the time of The
Weavers. They had performed at a segregated club in Detroit, they
dressed formally and their music had lost its rough edges. Seeger&#8217;s
1960s hit <em>Little Boxes</em> was a tame attack on conformity.
Performing in Israel in 1967 he even tried to bring Palestinian
refugees together with Israeli kibbutzniks at his concert, with
predictably disastrous results.</p>

<p>Yet Seeger&#8217;s significance is that he continued through very
tough times to put his beliefs into song, and to use song to bring
people together into activity. His father Charles argued that making
music as a group activity was &#8220;the essential thing&#8221; and his son
put that belief into practice throughout his life.</p>
