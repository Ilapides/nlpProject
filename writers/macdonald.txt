Dear Editor:
That was a swell editorial, How Long Will This War Last?, in your July 6 issue. Simply written, realistic, and – alas! – entirely true. The kind of truth that needs public statement these days. Congratulations.



 


Dwight Macdonald



P.S. – While I’m handing out bouquets, may I add that Labor Action has become, in the last year, the best popular paper I’ve seen in the American leftwing movement up to now.
New York, July 9
 



Dear Ex-Comrades:
Irving Howe’s article on Partisan Review is pleasantly distinguished from previous Trotskyist articles of this kind by its sober and civilized tone. It’s true he can’t resist a phrase like “the garbage pails of The New Republic and The Nation” – an echo of that contribution to Marxist culture, Max Shachtman’s profound essay entitled Old Garbage in New Pails – but in general he writes like a reasonable human being. A most welcome break with party tradition! Unfortunately the content of Howe’s remarks represents no break at all. At considerable length he establishes what is by now hardly a secret: that the editors of PR are divided on the war and that the magazine therefore has no editorial line on the war. But where he should analyze, he moralizes. PR’s alleged “dilemma” is interesting from two points of view: (1) How does it happen that the editors, once united on the war, are now divided? Is it because Rahv is a scoundrel? Or for deeper (and more significant) reasons? What does this show us about the intellectual life of America today? (2) What should those editors of PR who still hold a socialist position do, exactly? And what would be the effects, good or bad, of this or that action on their part? Instead of illuminating these, the really important aspects of the development of PR, Howe preaches the usual sermon about how sinful Rahv is and how unprincipled Greenberg and Macdonald are and how extraordinarily wicked and/or stupid everyone in the world today is, in fact, except members of the Workers Party. In this letter I’d like to try to get down to more interesting and significant issues.
Howe spends almost two full pages – over half his article – in a laborious analysis of that great historical document, the half-page editorial statement in our January-February issue. He rests most of his case on this analysis, patiently examing every nuance of logic, every twist and turn of rotten compromise. Yet it seems to me this statement is quite in line with the original editorial statement with which PR’s career began four years ago (and which the Trotskyists then found equally unsatisfactory). Howe seems to think now that the Socialist Appeal’s attack on this original statement was rather sectarian, and he agrees with the late John Wheelwright, who defended PR at the time in a witty and eloquent letter to the Appeal. In fact, the first part of Howe’s article is a long lament for the vanished golden age of PR, when it fulfilled its purpose, from his point of view. But has the change really been so great? I don’t think so. Two things, for example, worry Howe about our recent statement on the war: its emphasis on cultural values, which he thinks is a cowardly retreat, and its statement that the editors disagree on the war. Yet our 1937 statement declared:
For our editorial accent falls chiefly on culture and its broader social determinants. Conformity to a given social ideology or to a prescribed altitude or technique will not be asked of our writers ... Marxism in culture, we think, is first of all an instrument of analysis and evaluation; and if, in the last instance, it prevails over other disciplines, it does so through the medium of democratic controversy. Such is the medium PR will want to provide in its pages.
“Accent ... chiefly on culture,” “democratic controversy” – are not these formulations also the heart of our recent statement?
 
PR as a Cultural Magazine
But I really don’t think these formal statements worth terribly much space, whether to attack or defend. Let’s come down to the practical issue. Howe insists that the enunciation of editorial neutrality in our last issue but one means that PR is finished as a political organ. Why? Because it will not continue to publish left-wing articles critical of war and capitalism? No, because the statement explicitly declares that all the editors agree that “in times like these it is a necessity, not a luxury, for Partisan Review to continue to give space to radical – in the literal sense of ‘going to the roots’ – analysis of social issues and the war.” Then because PR will no longer editorially comment on the war? But I wonder if Howe realizes that the last issue in which such an editorial appeared was the Fall 1939 issue? So that PR has expressed no formal war position for two and a half years.
What Howe doesn’t understand, and what few Trotskyists have ever been able to understand, is that (1) PR is primarily a cultural magazine, and (2) that PR’s editorial policy has always been based on the principle of “democratic controversy,” both as to contributors and as to the editors themselves. Because of (1), we have tried to accept political articles not on the basis of whether the editors agree with their political tendency or not, but according to whether they seem to make an original contribution to serious political discussion. (That the editors have prejudices, being human, is true; but at least the formal criterion has never been adherence to any given political line.) I must also add that it has always seemed to us the main function of a magazine like PR to be to analyze, to understand, to speculate rather than to propagandize. As for (2), I can understand, on the basis of my own experience in the Trotskyist movement, how hard it is for a Trotskyist to grasp the idea that editors may disagree sharply with each other on political issues and yet be able to live and let live – and even to find these disagreements a source of stimulation rather than of weakness and confusion. The monolithic organizational tradition of Trotskyism can see in controversy only the soil of “splits” and “factions.” I’ve never believed this was a sensible way to organize a political party which hopes to achieve democratic social ends. And I’m even more sure, as a professional journalist, that it’s not the way to produce a good magazine of ideas.
 
Neutrality on the War
So much for PR’s future. But what about the present? What does Howe propose that the “left wing” of PR should do? Should we attempt a coup d’état, which would either smash up the magazine completely or put us in sole control? Or since it is the case that we would not favor such methods and that they would not be successful anyway, should we submit our resignations forthwith as editors? In that case, either PR would continue on a new pro-war basis, or else it would go out of existence altogether. Is that the alternative Howe thinks preferable to continuance on the present basis? It seems to be the implication of his article, although he does not venture to pose it so baldly.
These tactical questions cannot be answered until a question of principle is cleared up, namely: can a magazine like PR continue to serve any useful purpose, from a socialist and left-wing point of view, if it remains editorially neutral on the war issue? Again, Howe seems to imply it cannot, but once more he fails to argue the question or even, indeed, to pose it clearly. (The trouble with the present-day Trotskyist approach is that it is primarily moralistic, that it assumes its basic positions instead of analyzing them and thus showing how they apply, in theory and in practice, to the problem in question.) Now there unquestionably are issues, in my opinion, on which a magazine like PR could not remain neutral and still fulfill its function, either politically or culturally. Fascism is one, Stalinism another. Personally, I should be unwilling, in fact unable, to take part in editing a magazine with colleagues of fascist or Stalinist views, because those political doctrines are so vicious and so all-embracing as to corrupt all human and cultural values. But is this true of a pro-war position? I don’t think so. People support the war in a hundred different way, from a dozen different political positions. The values of democratic capitalism, for all their defects, are certainly far superior in a human way to those of fascism or Stalinism. It is true that the tendencies toward some totalitarian solution will probably become more sharply accentuated as the war drags on, and the time may come when support of the present war may necessitate the same kind of dehumanization as support of Stalinism or fascism now involves. But that point is as yet a considerable distance away, and it is revolutionary ultimatism to behave now as though it were already reached. In fact, it seems to me one of the ways to prevent its being reached is precisely to keep open organs of “democratic controversy” on the war issue like PR.
 
Trotskyists as Political Purists
My dear ex-comrades, if you are really so concerned that PR should preserve its revolutionary virtue, if you think it so disgraceful that PR hasn’t printed more left-wing material, why haven’t any of you taken the trouble ever to write for the magazine? The only Trotskyist intellectual who ever wrote regularly for us was ... James Burnham. PR still opens its pages to radical and Marxist criticism of the war. Yet today, as in the past, the Trotskyists are satisfied to complain about its political impurity, without thinking of doing anything so practical as to write articles for PR’s audience (not a negligible one, either in quantity or quality) expressing their point of view. Why didn’t Shachtman take advantage of the opportunity we gave him to review Burnham’s book? Why didn’t the Ten Propositions controversy provoke any letters or articles from Trotskyists?
It seems that in this as in other fields, my dear ex-comrades, you conceive your function to be that of critical bystanders purely, commentators on the struggle looking down from the lofty heights of Marxistical illumination. Trotsky spoke of the epigones of Lenin. His own epigones have given us by their practice a new political type: the revolutionary kibitzer.

THE CRISIS OF American capitalism has stimulated an extra-ordinary popular interest in politics. Nothing like it has been known since the, decade preceding the Civil War. College undergraduates desert the humanities for economics and sociology. Smoking car discussions veer away from baseball towards the New Deal. But the most striking symptom is the rise of a dozen newspaper columnists to nation-wide influence. There is nothing new about columnists. The “inspirational” column, where Dr. Frank Crane has been succeeded by Dale Carnegie; the gossip column, where O.O. Mclntyre yields to Walter Winchell; the political “inside stuff” column, such as Paul Mallon’s News Behind the News and the Pearson-Allen Washington Merry-Go-Round – these are long familiar types. But there is no precedent for the enormous popularity of the political oracle. Incredible as it may seem, not so long ago Dorothy Thompson was celebrated chiefly as the wife of Sinclair Lewis.
A rough gauge of a columnist’s influence is the number of newspapers to which his stuff is syndicated. At this moment, the ten leading political oracles are [1]:

"



Reading from left to right, politically: Broun, Franklin and Clapper are friendly to the New Deal; Johnson, Pegler, Lippmann and Thompson are New Deal baiters with more or less liberal vocabularies; while Sullivan, Kent and Lawrence are rabidly anti-Roosevelt. In the past year, the New Dealers have marked time at the bottom of the list, and the reactionaries have suffered heavy losses – in March, 1937, according to The New Republic, Lawrence had 150 papers, Kent 125, and Sullivan 70. The “centrists”, on the other hand, have flourished amazingly – in March 1937, Thompson appeared in only 75 papers, Pegler in only 86. This month I intend to confine myself to this currently dominant group.
* * *
Why this boom for the centrists? It is true that all four have been drifting rapidly to the right, and that this has by no means lessened their charm for the newspaper publisher. Reading their output today, one finds it hard to believe that in the 1936 presidential campaign, Pegler and Johnson were for Roosevelt, Thompson was neutral, and Lippmann’s belated declaration for Landon came as an unexpected bombshell in the liberal camp. But if reactionary comment was all the publishers wanted, Messrs. Sullivan, Kent and Lawrence could supply it far more effectively. There are subtler calculations in play here. After 1936, even the publishers realized that the New Deal can’t be beaten with a straight reactionary program. Shrewdly, they began to exploit a tradition of American journalism which had been allowed to lapse since the War: the conception of the “free press” as the Tribune of the People. They took the mantle dropped from the crusading editors and muckrakers of earlier generations and draped it about the shoulders of Walter Lippmann. The “people” for whom these tribunes have always spoken is not to be confused with the masses. Godkin and Steffens and Tarbell were the mouthpieces of the vast and heterogenous American middle class. They were as oblivious of the workers as their heirs of today are. But there is, just the same, a difference.
The older generations of tribunes really fought for the interests of the petty bourgeoisie they professed to represent. They seriously tried, with varying success, to limit the economic power of the big bourgeoisie and to contest its political supremacy. The function of the contemporary tribuni plebis is at once more modest and more complicated. Their job is to give the rank and file of the middle class the illusion that it has powerful spokesmen, without, however, actually endangering the status quo. As the crisis sharpens and the balance of class power trembles ever more precariously, this function becomes more essential – and more difficult. Fortunately, most of them have had long experience at greasing the gears of capitalism with democratic ideology. Lippmann’s progress from the New Republic to the World to the Herald Tribune is well known. As a foreign correspondent, Thompson’s liberalism was enough to get her expelled from Nazi Germany. Johnson’s career was made by his “chief”, Bernard Baruch, the good grey liberal of Wall Street and perennial fount of Democratic funds. Only Pegler lacks these advantages: he came straight from the sports page and, politically, is still virgo intacta. But he has played shrewdly on the common American, superstition that ignorance is a guarantee of impartiality.
* * *
Any one who still has any illusions about the Wages-and-Hours Bill should read General Johnson’s column of June 15. Excerpt: “As I read this new bill ... the only trouble is going to be on the question of North-South differentials ... As a matter of fact, the problem under this bill is not nearly so serious as it sounds. Most Southern Negro labor is either in agriculture or in purely local enterprise. Both are exempted from the bill. The starting minimum wage is so low – $11 a week – that it will cause no serious upset even in the South ... The country was clearly committed by overwhelming majorities to Federal wage-hour legislation and, according to recent polls, still heavily favors it ... I don’t know how it could have been a milder and more flexible measure without being just an empty gesture.”
* * *
Indignation is to the columnist as gasoline is to the internal combustion engine. The great majority of the month’s columns ran on this potent fuel. The most popular topic was the iniquity of the Administration’s attempt to defeat in the primaries certain hostile Democratic senators. To the layman, it might seem that the President has a right to oppose his opponents. “Formerly, in ordinary circumstances,” Johnson (June 6) admitted, “there was no moral reason why a President shouldn’t express his preference in a Congressional primary.” But the current campaigns against right-wing Democrats “are impersonal punishments of legislators for voting for their convictions”. In short, it is moral for a President to interfere in primaries to satisfy personal grudges, but immoral to act from political considerations. Various other crimes against humanity also received their meed of protest: the Wagner Act, the surplus profits tax, the anti-monopoly drive. The People’s Tribunes also found space to comment on the proposed diversion of the Yellowstone River (“Stop the “Vandals!” roared Johnson), the humors of amateur male cookery, and President Roosevelt’s vocabulary (which received a D minus). But there was one theme which was passed over in silence.
At the beginning of May, the cities of Ohio ran out of relief funds. In Cleveland alone, the NY Times (May 11) reported, 25,000 families “are facing the danger of starvation”. A week later, Chicago ran out of funds and shut down her relief stations, forcing 91,000 men, women and children to get along for two weeks on a handout of surplus vegetables with a retail value of 54 cents per person. As a final turn of the screw, the victims were the aged, the infirm, and the very young – the “unemployables”. (The employables were all on the iniquitous WPA, which didn’t break down.) Now here, the Man from Mars might say, with that naivete which makes him so useful, was a great opportunity for indignation. Yet none of the Tribunes of the People so much as mentioned the subject. For the benefit of the Man from Mars, there were three excellent reasons for their silence:

relief recipients are not people;
 
the breakdown was caused by the failure of state legislatures to appropriate sufficient funds (for the Martian’s further enlightenment, it should be explained that the columnists, on the highest moral grounds, think relief should be a local and not a Federal concern);
 
what scanty rations the unemployables did get, came from the Surplus Commodities Corporation, doubly immoral because it is a New Deal agency and because it interferes with “the law of supply and demand”.

* * *
The apathy with which the columnists view the sufferings of the unemployed vanishes when they see the skillful use the New Deal is making of this misery. A terrible fear is haunting them at present: that the New Deal, through its control of relief funds, may be able to perpetuate itself forever. This fear became panic when Harry Hopkins made his indiscreet gesture in the Iowa primaries. Johnson (May 18) was cynical: “You can’t beat four billion dollars.” Lippmann (May 26) was philosophical: “Thus we are being instructed as to how, by control of the Treasury and of the national credit, a political machine perpetuates itself.” Thompson (May 27) contrived to be at once hysterical and didactic:
“Underlying all good democratic government are certain silent assumptions ... It is assumed that no party in power will so exploit its position as to make it almost impossible for any other party ever to come to power. For if these assumptions are violated, then it is theoretically possible for any political party to keep itself in office forever. And that condition means the end of democratic government.”
Pegler (May 31) speaks with unwonted seriousness:
“No man ever should have been given such vote-buying power, and the power should never be placed in any man’s hands again. That. money can never buy the people anything one-half so precious as what they are asked to sell.”
When Chicago’s relief funds gave out, each of its 91,000 unemployables was given the following weekly ration: ½ lb. rice, ½ lb. butter, ¼ lb. dried beans, 4 lbs. oranges, ½ lb. prunes, 1½ lbs. cabbage, and 1 stalk of celery. It would be interesting to see how precious Mr. Pegler would consider his vote after a week on this diet. Would he take a lamb chop for it – or would he hold out for a steak?
* * *
At the end of May, the NY Herald-Tribune’s two star columnists went away on vacations. Their valedictories were more revealing than was perhaps intended. Lippmann’s was mildly playful? It boiled down to:

“The great fact of our time” is that “large portions of mankind are under the spell of men who seem to go to bed with their boots on” (i.e., dictators);
 
this collective mania can’t be treated; it must be allowed to run its course;
 
“The great issues which now embroil mankind ... are in the deepest sense insoluble in that they arise out of passionate differences about human values.”

From this infantile diagnosis of our social ills, Lippmann quite logically concludes that the disease is beyond any of his medicines. “It is exhausting,” he sighs, “to live perpetually on the grand scale of world history.” Dorothy Thompson’s leave-taking, in her most elaborately whimsical manner, was cast in the form of a breakfast table conversation with her celebrated husband (archly referred to as “The Grouse”). At great length, The Grouse explains to his wife (and to her 7,500,000 readers) the differences between socialism, communism, fascism and the New Deal in the “Let-us-suppose-you-have-two-cows” vein. (“The New Deal tells you that you should shoot one of the cows and pour the milk down the sink.”) After a good deal of such playfulness, The Grouse, perspiring and somewhat blown, arrives at The Point: “That’s why I say there isn’t any solution.” The similarity with Lippmann’s conclusion is striking and hardly accidental.
* * *
Pegler’s political line is simple: whatever organized society does is intolerable. (He has a corresponding distaste for organized thought – i.e., “theory”.) He can stomach savagery and corruption – as his well-known defense of lynching and his elegy on Al Capone as a victim of governmental persecution – but he is quick to protest any taint of legality. So long as Hague confined himself to beating up Reds and union men, Pegler was on his side. He devoted three full columns to arguing that Hague was just an overgrown boy, no worse than any political boss. But on June 8, Pegler announced with a considerable flourish:
“This is the day I eat a platter of crow. Frank Hague ... is as ruthless and dangerous as Huey Long at his worst.”
It seems that in arranging his “Americanism” parade, Hague had included 700 National Guardsmen in the line of march. This display of armed authority changed Pegler’s attitude overnight. The distinction between Hague’s police and Hague’s Guardsmen may seem academic. But Pegler is allergic to the National Guard – except, of course, in strikes.
* * *
Wishful thinking is an occupational disease of columnists which especially afflicts General Johnson. Thus on May 28 be reported, on the basis of a speech he had just made before the American Iron & Steel Institute, that in the steel industry, and in big business in general, “there is very little spirit of resistance to recent trends of government ... Gone also is much of the recent hate-Roosevelt fixation”. Someone should tell the General that the vice-president of the Steel Institute is named E.T. Weir, that the president is named Tom Girdler, and that at the same session at which the General spoke, President Girdler delivered an impassioned Philippic against the New Deal.
Even more remarkable is Johnson’s column of June 13, which abuses the Federal Trade Commission for reporting that the farm implement business is monopolistically controlled. “Although I left the industry twelve years ago,” writes Johnson, “I know it. I was a small manufacturer without a ‘full line’, but we found a way to compete most successfully ...” He neglects to mention that his company, the Moline Plow Co., competed so successfully that it went into bankruptcy, and that the Johnson crowd was widely known in Wall Street as “the Moline Wrecking Crew”.
* * *
Occasionally a Tribune of the People takes his role too seriously, and the publisher must exercize his legal right to kill that day’s column. (He buys the right to suppress as well as the right to print.) The Herald-Tribune pundits have never been guilty of such a lapse, but the Scripps-Howard oracles, politically and psychologically more unstable, sometimes require disciplining. When, in April, Johnson eulogized John L. Lewis, and when, in May, Pegler blasted Franco and the Catholic hierarchy, many Scripps-Howard papers omitted both columns. Here would seem to be matter for high indignation. Here were Regimentation and Dictatorship at their rankest! The reaction of both victims was, to their less sophisticated readers, incomprehensible. Less than a week after the outrage, Johnson wrote, in a column which was not suppressed:
“In the freedom of the American press which still prevails, and the liberalism of the Scripps-Howard newspapers, of which I am an exponent, I am permitted to say whatever I please.”
Pegler, the caustic enfant terrible of journalism, was even more abject. He devoted his columns of June 10 and 11 to proving that the American press is “the best in the world”. Admitting that perhaps the publishers don’t see eye to eye with their readers on the New Deal, Pegler suggests that it is “the task of the ... free press to criticize the party in power”. Everyone remembers the great newspaper campaigns against the Coolidge administration.
* * *
The columnists are ever vigilant to defend the interests of their middle-class readers against the politicians and dictators. But a strange lethargy overcomes them when the threat comes from big business. Not one of them last month had anything to say about such developments – directly touching the class interests of their supposed constituents – as

the sensational looting of Continental Securities, in which some of the most respectable Wall Street firms were involved;
 
the denunciation by a Federal Judge of Bethlehem Steel’s profits on wartime government contracts as “sinful” and “a racket”;
 
the news that fourteen of the twenty-two big oil companies now waiting trial on Sherman Act charges have decided to pay maximum fines and costs rather than contest the suit.

* * *
Of the tribunate under the Roman Republic, the Encyclopedia Britannica has this to say: “From being an opposition weapon, it became an important wheel in the regular machine of state.” The Encyclopaedia further notes, of the founder of the Empire:
“Augustus showed the highest statesmanship in founding his power upon a metamorphosed tribunate rather than upon a metamorphosed dictatorship, upon traditions which were democratic rather than upon traditions which were patrician ...”

To The Editor:
The Socialist Appeal did a magnificent job during the recent war crisis, but there is one bone which I must pick with it. Its October 10 issue stated editorially, apropos of the Lovestoneites: “During the crisis, their paper too failed to appear. And when it did – a faltering voice, a party afraid of its own shadow ...” I have looked up the files of the Workers Age and find that it appeared regularly every week throughout September and October. Nor did its voice seem so faltering to me, even compared to the Appeal. Both papers gave the war crisis front page prominence on October 1, for example. It is worth comparing their major formulations.
The Workers Age said:
“The war which threatens us today will ... not be a war of liberation on the part of the ‘democratic’ imperialist states.”
“Czechoslovakian national capitalism has oppressed workers in Czechoslovakia, whatever their nationality ... How can it he trusted to fight for liberty?”
“Only a revolutionary workers government will be capable of waging, if necessary, a really anti-fascist war for the liberation of the peoples.”
The Socialist Appeal said:
“Not democracy but the rivalries over spoils and tribute is at stake between Hitler and the ‘democratic nations.’
“The interest of the Czech government is to uphold the property and the profits of the Czech capitalists and bankers, to enable them to continue their twenty-year exploitation of all the peoples of Czechoslovakia.”
“But there is only one way to fight Hitler and Hitlerism: by breaking away altogether from your own bourgeoisie ... by launching your own firm and independent struggle under your own leaders.”
Both papers also called for the defense of the Soviet Union. It is true that the Age’s formulations were academic and dry as compared to the ardent and moving tones of the Appeal, and it is true that the Appeal exploited the
crisis more boldly and effectively. But the basic programs of both papers seem to me too similar for the Appeal to be justified in contemptuously dismissing the Lovestoneites as “another small group which makes big claims for its anti-war position.” And, of course, there is no excuse for stating that the Age failed to appear when it actually did appear. I dwell at such length on this point because it seems to me a good example of a tendency on the part of Marxist groups to blackguard each other with more enthusiasm than sense of responsibility. Let us have polemics, by all means, but let us also have fair play.
Dwight Macdonald


Our Reply
On the factual point raised in comrade Macdonald’s communication, we cannot but agree. The Lovestone paper did not fail to appear, and the statement in our editorial of October 10 was therefore erroneous, based on a report we received but failed to check up. Hence, a public rectification is called for and we duly record it.
On the political point, we find no reason for amending our judgment of the Lovestoneite anti-war position. Far from being “too similar” – as they seem to be to comrade Macdonald – we believe that the “basic programs of both papers,” the Appeal and the Workers Age, are irreconcilable. The struggle against imperialist war is possible only on the basis of a revolutionary struggle against capitalism and for the class independence of the proletariat. It is therefore only a combination of export-radicalism, phrase-mongering and duplicity when Lovestone speaks of a “revolutionary workers government” – for far-off Czechoslovakia! – and at the same time follows a People’s Front or “Democratic” Front course in the United States, with all that it implies in the realities of the anti-war struggle.
It is precisely the revolutionary Marxist who refuses to separate the “struggle against war” and the “struggle against capitalism” into two different compartments, for all experience shows that the separation leads inexorably to social-patriotism. Lovestone’s support of the LaGuardia People’s Front in the last New York Mayoralty election; of the Lehman-Wagner-Rose-Browder Front in the last New York state election; and of the outright Roosevelt-Democratic candidates in Michigan, California and Massachusetts – show, as we have repeatedly emphasized, how Lovestone’s policy in practice voids all claims to a revolutionary position on the war question.
Remaining doubts may be removed by an examination of the program of the Lovestone-Thomas-Libby-Lapp-Fish edition of the People’s Front and League for Peace, namely, the “Keep America Out of War Committee.”
To us it is self-evident that no one can pursue a policy of class collaboration and petty bourgeois pacifism and yet lay claim to a proletarian anti-war position, much less to one “similar” to ours. Whoever tries to do both these things is perpetrating a fraud, which deserves no less vigorous exposure and condemnation than the fraud of the Stalinists, who also know how to use a revolutionary phrase or two on holiday occasions. If criticism is due the Socialist Appeal it would be in place to apply it to its failure to deal more systematically and adequately with the shoddy opportunistic realities behind Lovestone’s pretentious lip-service to principles he has long ago abandoned. – The Editor.
 


 FOR WEEKS NOW, the New Deal’s war drive has been marching along in black headlines: “ARMY MOBILIZES INDUSTRY FOR WAR”, “ROOSEVELT WARNS NATION MUST ARM IN WORLD OF FORCE”, “ROOSEVELT ORDERS DEFENSE SURVEY”. Much is said of “defense”, but very little of who and where is The Enemy against whom we must defend ourselves. A recent issue of Time lifts the veil a bit:
“The Army’s present guesses rate future wars in the following order of likelihood: (1) civil uprisings on the US mainland — some sort of trouble in the social order; (2) war in South America in case fascist economic penetration rubs the US past endurance; (3) war in Europe or Asia for any reason; (4) least likely of all, invasion of the US mainland ... Surprising to most US citizens would be the contents of the General Staff ‘White Paper’—a thorough plan for suppressing civil disorder in the US. In it every large city is divided into possible battle zones. Paved highway intersections are marked down for airplane runways ... US Army officers mull over their ‘White Paper’ a great deal of the time and talk about it none of the time.”
Thus the bourgeoisie, as well as the proletariat, can act on Liebknecht’s slogan: “The main enemy is within our own country.”
Even the editors of the Nation would presumably deplore a Class war. But let us assume that the war comes under categories 2, 3, or 4—what then? The hosts of democracy would be led by a former corporation lawyer and National Commander of the American Legion named Louis A. Johnson, the real power in the New Deal’s War Department. He has been “notably successful” in persuading big industrialists to go along with the New Deal’s war plans. His eloquence has been reenforced by the fact that government contracts, in the next war as in the last war, will be on the scandalous ‘cost-plus’ basis, which makes cheating the government almost obligatory. As for the rest of us, Mr. Johnson points out that in the next war, “The civilians will be fighting, too.” Every one will be mobilized, either to fight or to work. The middle classes and the workers will be conscripted to a man for military or labor service.
“The Social Security Board’s list of some 40,000,000 US citizens, identified by age, residence, and occupation,” drily comments Time, “will be very useful for this purpose.”

When a “liberal” employer is losing money, he acts just like any other employer who is losing money. This axiom is being currently demonstrated by J. David Stern, the only 100% New Dealer among the big newspaper publishers. Mr. Stern has made quite a good thing out of liberalism, expanding his operations from the Camden (N.J.) Courier-Post to the Philadelphia Record, which he made into that city’s first liberal paper since Ben Franklin died. In 1933, he bought the old New York Post and grafted fresh liberal glands into it. But of late Mr. Stern has run into difficulties, especially with the Post: he has had to borrow $3,000,000, to cut the Post’s budget by $5,000 a week, and to chisel on wages. He was the first big publisher to sign a contract with the Newspaper Guild. But that was when the New Deal, and Mr. Stern’s investment in liberalism, were in full summer. Now, as autumn draws in, the Stern papers are clashing openly with the Guild. An attempt is being made on the Camden Courier-Post to form a company union. And on the NY Post, Mr. Stern, balked for months by the Guild in his efforts to slash wages, has discovered a most ingenious detour around union contracts. Not long ago, he asked his employees to “lend” him 10% of their paychecks, the loans to be repaid at 2% when the paper makes money again. “You would lend money to your grandmother,” he argued, “why not to your boss?” He also argued that the transaction was a purely personal matter between him and each employee, and so no affair of any trade union. The old-line AF of L mechanical unions on the Post  agreed to this interpretation readily enough, but the Newspaper Guild was obstinate. Mr. Stern said he would close down the Post in forty-eight hours. The Guild was still firm. Mr. Stern denies he called up President Roosevelt and asked for help. But he did call up John L. Lewis, who then called up Guild officials in Manhattan and urged them to accept the proposition “the way Stern wants it”. This the Guild did. It is now preparing its forces to put up a better fight in Philadelphia.
It is odd that very little of all this has appeared in the public prints. The Stalinists in control of the Newspaper Guild are said to be reluctant to expose publicly the staunchest journalistic ally of the New Deal. Partly for this reason, partly from sheer journalistic anaemia, the Nation and the New Republic have said nothing about Mr. Stern’s recent activities. The story goes that the Nation a year or so ago accepted an article debunking Stern’s liberalism, but lost its nerve when the manuscript was branded unfair and untrue by ... J. David Stern.

This Is the Way the World Ends. Obituaries are generally printed on the inside pages of American newspapers, but the November 3 issue of the NY Times devoted most of its front pages to death notices. The deceased was that system of world society which existed between the battle of Waterloo and the Munich conference. There were three major death notices.
 The “Open Door” in China: Japan announced “the establishment of a new order that will insure the permanent stability of East Asia” and added, “Japan is confident that other powers will adapt their attitude to the new conditions prevailing in East Asia.” The Franco-British Hegemony in Europe: the German and Italian foreign ministers met in Berlin and gave Hungary 4,000 square miles of Czech territory, without consulting either the League of Nations or the four-power consortium solemnized a month earlier at Munich. The British Empire: a third front-page item reported the approval by a landslide vote in the House of Commons of the Anglo-Italian treaty, giving Italy a free hand in Spain and the Mediterranean. Several hours earlier, a Spanish rebel trawler had shelled and sunk a British-owned freighter within sight of the Norfolk coast. “The news,” reported the Times, “had not the slightest effect upon the debate in the Commons.”  A few years ago, T. S. Eliot wrote:
    This is the way the world ends  This is the way the world ends  This is the way the world ends  Not with a bang but a whimper.

Due Process of Law. Section 7-a of the NIRA gave legal sanction to labor’s right to organize. So does the Wagner Act. When the employees of the Weirton Steel Co. tried to form a union, E.T. (“Shoot-a-Few”) Weir defied the NRA labor board, took the case into the courts, and won a victory, after two years of litigation. All the liberals shook their heads and said, Tsk! Tsk! And now the comedy is being played over again, almost line for line. The second Weirton case is now rounding out its second year. In May 1937, the Steel Workers Organizing Committee filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against the Weirton Steel Co. The Board got around to serving a complaint on the company three months later, and hearings began August 16, 1937. By February 28, 1938, the Labor Board had completed its case. The company began its defense on April 5, 1938, and has been at it, off and on, ever since. To date, 473 witnesses have given 31,919 pages of testimony in 180 trial days. The record now contains 3,721 exhibits and 7,435 objections and motions (of which 6,044, almost all of them made by counsel for Weirton, were overruled). Once more the liberals are clucking with indignation and surprise.

The American Russian Institute is a most respectable organization “to promote cultural relations between the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union”. In the October issue of its American Quarterly on the Soviet Union, Major George Fielding Eliot published an article on the Soviet army which was so frank that, a few weeks later, the editorial board had to print a lengthy and abject apology for the article, practically repudiating it and promising to be good little boys in future. And indeed the Major’s piece was not very tactful: he expressed doubt as to the Red Army’s morale after recent heavy executions of its commanders, and he criticized, from a purely military viewpoint, the subordination of Red Army officers to Kremlin agents, placed at their elbow in the guise of “political commissars”. Worse yet, the article appeared during the Czech crisis, when Russia’s military strength was an especially tender subject. And worst of all, some demon inspired the Major to make a single exception to his criticism, namely, the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army.
“This force, 400,000 strong,” he wrote, “has been very little if at all affected by the Tukhachevsky affair. ... The political commissar system is here perhaps more honored in the breach than in the observance. Thousands of miles from Moscow, commanded — apparently with a free hand—by the most capable of all Soviet generals ... the Far Eastern Army is easily the most efficient and the most formidable military force at the command of the Soviet government.”
Shortly after Major Eliot’s article appeared, it became evident that the commander of the Far Eastern Army, Marshal Vasili Galen-Blücher, “most capable of all Soviet generals”, had fallen into disgrace and perhaps had even shared the fate of Marshal Tukhachevsky. The political exigencies of the bureaucracy had once more clashed with the needs of the Soviet Union, and with the usual result.

Not long ago, Justice Salvatore A. Cotillo of the New York Supreme Court issued a sweeping injunction against picketing in the Busch jewelry stores strike. When the strikers violated its terms, as they had to do if they were to continue the strike, he handed out heavy jail sentences and fines, and also cited their lawyer for contempt of court. The interesting thing about Judge Cotillo is that he was elected to his present position, which pays some $20,000 a year, with the endorsement of the American Labor Party.

I was shocked by the “message to the future” which Albert Einstein wrote to be deposited in the New York World’s Fair 5,000-Year “Time Capsule”. (A rather vague message from Thomas Mann was also included, along with such objects as a lipstick, a baseball, and a newsreel of the bombing of Canton.) There was nothing vague about Einstein’s message. He began with a few words on this century’s progress in applied science, and went on to point out that “the production and distribution of commodities is entirely unorganized” and that “people living in different countries kill each other at irregular intervals”. Then, as calmly and soberly as though he were setting down the inescapable final terms of an equation, Einstein concluded: “This is due to the fact that the intelligence and character of the masses are incomparably lower than the intelligence and character of the few who produce something really valuable for the community.” It is hard to accept the fact that a man may be a great scientist and at the same time, in political matters, as much the unconscious dupe of his class prejudices as lesser men. And it is depressing to think that Dr. Einstein is a refugee from that very fascism whose ideology he here expresses.

The forces of Democracy won a close victory in the recent Chilean elections. It was the first Popular Front coalition in South American history, and it carried that peculiar form of political life far beyond anything yet seen in Europe. (The law of combined development may have had something to do with it.) The champion of Democracy, Pedro Aguirre Cerda, was a millionaire landowner and a member of the “Radical” party, which is about as radical in Chile as in France. He made it clear immediately that there will be no farcical Blum Interlude: the velvet glove will be peeled off the iron hand the day the Popular Front government takes office.
“Left-wing governments which have been in power during recent years,” Senor Aguirre told reporters, “could have accomplished much more if they had been assured two assets: discretion on the part of the rulers and discipline among the masses.”
Asked whether his communist supporters might not insist on “extreme policies”, Aguirre replied:
“The communists and socialists have asked for no pledges, for no places in my cabinet. Their demands have been limited to the platform which we adopted.”
He also pointed out that, while the Radicals moved slightly to the left in joining the coalition, “the socialists and the communists made an even greater shift to the right”. The final comedy touch came when the Chilean Nacistas, or Nazis, angry because the present conservative government suppressed their attempted coup last month, joined the Popular Front coalition.

Practically every one with a radio heard the glad tidings, sent out from the President’s fireside shortly before the elections, that Prosperity was once more abroad in the land. Very few people, on the other hand, saw a report issued by the Federal Reserve Board at about the same time, which stated:
“The country’s volume of deposits is near the all-time peak, while the turnover of these deposits is at the slowest rate on record.”
In New York City, for example, the volume of checks cashed is normally eighty times the average of deposits. Today, it is only twenty-five times deposits. This means, of course, that capital is piling up in the banks without being able to find outlets for profitable investment. It is true that corporation earnings are reviving, that the automobile companies are rehiring men by the tens of thousands, that the steel industry has pulled itself up to over 60% of capacity operations. But these are superficial indices. It is precisely in the most crucial sector—the stimulation of new capital investments—that the New Deal has broken down most disastrously. Today, as in 1932, investors just aren’t investing—despite the housecleaning and fumigating of the SEC. Banks just aren’t lending — despite the periodical exhortations of Jesse Jones of the RFC to “cease frightening potential borrowers away”. (New Dealers, like their friends of the CP, seem to think of capitalists as wilfully and perversely refusing to make money.) Since bank loans and new—as against refunding—security issues show no signs of coming back to pre-1930 levels, the President’s words of cheer are to be taken no more seriously than his famous smile.
 



Trotsky’s article on Kronstadt in your April issue was, to me, disappointing and embarrassing. Disappointing because I had hoped for a frank and reasonably objective explanation of the Kronstadt affair. Embarrassing because I admire Trotsky and accept many of his theories. An article like this – essentially a piece of special pleading, however brilliant – makes it harder to defend Trotsky from the often-made accusation that his thinking is sectarian and inflexible.
For those who believe, as I do, that the proletarian revolution is the only road to socialism, the question of the day is: how can we avoid the sort of degeneration that has taken place in the USSR? Specifically, to what extent must Bolshevist theory bear the responsibility for the rise of Stalinism? In The Revolution Betrayed, Trotsky demonstrates that Stalinism is primarily a reflection of the low level of productivity and economic development of Russia. But even if one accepts this analysis, as I do, an important contributory cause may still be found in certain weaknesses of Bolshevist political theory. Is it not the duty of Marxists today relentlessly to search out these weaknesses, to reconsider the entire Bolshevist line with scientific detachment? My impression is that Trotsky has shown little interest in any such basic reconsideration. He seems to be more interested in defending Leninism than in learning from its mistakes.
The article on Kronstadt is a good example of what I mean. It is impassioned, eloquent, and – unconvincing. Trotsky may be correct in all his contentions. But he approaches the subject in such a way as to make it impossible for the detached observer to form an intelligent opinion. I have neither the time nor the knowledge – and The New International certainly hasn’t the space – to argue the Kronstadt question here. But I would like to indicate a few misgivings about the tone of Trotsky’s article. In general, it seems to me that Trotsky takes a polemical approach to a question that should be considered dispassionately, with some respect for the other side. The very title is contemptuous: Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt. The opposition is characterized in police court terms – “this variegated fraternity”, “this truly charlatan campaign”. To justify such abuse, Trotsky must bring forward much stronger evidence to offset the statements of Serge, Thomas, Berkman, and Souvarine than he (or Wright) has up to now.
Trotsky begins his article with an amalgam worthy of Vyshinsky: “Participating in the campaign ... are anarchists, Russian Mensheviks, left social-democrats ... individual blunderers, Miliukov’s paper, and, on occasion, the big capitalist press. A ‘People’s Front’ of its own kind!” (The only category which seems to fit me is “individual blunderer”. Trotsky seems unable to imagine anyone criticising Kronstadt unless he has a political axe to grind or is a dupe, while the Stalinists catalogue all critics of the Moscow Trials as Trotskyists, fascists, assassins, and – my own label – Trotskyist stooges.) I can’t see as much difference as I would like to see between Trotsky’s insistence that, because the enemies of the revolution have used the Kronstadt affair to discredit Bolshevism, therefore all who express doubts about Kronstadt are (“objectively” considered) allies of counter-revolution; and Vyshinsky’s insistence that the Fourth International and the Gestapo are comrades-in-arms because both oppose the Stalinist regime. This exclusion of subjective motivation as irrelevant, this refusal to consider aims, programs, theories, anything except the objective fact of opposition – this cast of mind seems to me dangerous and unrealistic. I insist it is possible to have doubts about Kronstadt without being either a knave or a fool.
Having created his amalgam, Trotsky defines its lowest common denominator – and very low it is. “How can the Kronstadt uprising cause such heartburn to anarchists, Mensheviks, and ‘liberal’ counter-revolutionists, all at the same time?” he asks. “The answer is simple: all these groupings are interested in compromising the only genuinely revolutionary current which has never repudiated its banner ...” The answer is perhaps a bit too simple – another thing that bothers me, by the way, about Trotsky’s answers. So far as I am conscious, I am not interested in “compromising” Bolshevism; on the contrary, I wish I were able to accept it 100 per cent. But I unfortunately have certain doubts, objections, criticisms. Is it impossible to express them without being accused of counterrevolution and herded into an amalgam of anarchists, Mensheviks and capitalist journalists?
Most of Trotsky’s article attempts to show that the social base of the Kronstadt uprising was petty bourgeois. He makes one major point: that the Kronstadt sailors of 1921 were quite a different group from the revolutionary heroes of 1917. But the rest of his lengthy argument boils down to an identification of all the elements which opposed the Bolsheviks as “petty bourgeois”. He advances little evidence to support this labelling, beyond the indisputable fact that they were all anti-Bolshevik. His reasoning seems to be: only the Bolshevist policy could save the revolution; the Makhno bands, the Greens, the Social Revolutionaries, the Kronstadters, etc., were against the Bolsheviks; therefore, objectively, they were counter-revolutionary; therefore, they were, objectively, working for the bourgeoisie. This reasoning begs the whole question. But even if the initial assumption be accepted, it is still a dangerous intellectual process. It rationalizes an unpleasant administrative necessity – the suppression of political opponents who also are acting for what they conceive to be the best interests of the masses – into a struggle between Good and Evil. A police measure becomes a political crusade, by simply refusing to distinguish between the subjective and the objective categories – as if a bank robber should be indicted for trying to overthrow capitalism! Stalin has learned the trick all too well.
Trotsky has very little to say about the way the Bolsheviks handled the Kronstadt affair itself. He presents no defense for the mass executions which, according to Victor Serge, took place for months after the rebels had been crushed. In fact, he doesn’t mention this aspect at all. Nor does he pay much attention to the crucial question: how seriously did the Bolshevists try to reach a peaceful settlement before they brought up the field guns? He dismisses this:
“Or perhaps it would have been sufficient to inform the Kronstadt sailors of the NEP decrees to pacify them? Illusion! The insurgents did not have a conscious program and they could not have one because of the very nature of the petty bourgeoisie.”
Here Trotsky admits, by implication, that Souvarine states: that Lenin was putting the finishing touches on the NEP during the Tenth Party Congress, which broke up to allow the delegates to take part in the attack on Kronstadt. It was a serious decision Lenin and Trotsky took: to withhold public announcement of NEP until after the rebellion, which asked for some of the very concessions which the NEP granted, had been drowned in blood. How could they be so sure it would have been impossible to compromise with the Kronstadters on the basis of the NEP? A few sentences earlier, Trotsky admits that “the introduction of the NEP one year earlier would have averted the Kronstadt uprising”. But the Kronstadters, writes Trotsky, being petty bourgeois, didn’t have any “conscious program” and so couldn’t have been appealed to by programmatic concessions. Petty bourgeois or not, the Kronstadters did have a program. Souvarine, for one, gives it in his life of Stalin as, “Free elections to the Soviets; free speech and a free press for workers and peasants, left-wing socialists, anarchists and syndicalists; the release of workers and peasants held as political prisoners; the abolition of the privileges of the Communist party; equal rations for all workers; the right of peasants and self-employing artisans to dispose of the product of their work.” Perhaps Trotsky uses the term “conscious program” in a special sense.
To me the most interesting statement in the article is:
“It is true ... that I had already proposed the transition to NEP in 1920 ... When I met opposition from the leaders of the party, I did not appeal to the ranks, in order to avoid mobilizing the petty bourgeoisie against the workers.”
As Trotsky points out, Lenin admitted that the policy of “War Communism” was adhered to longer than it should have been. Was this simply a mistake in judgment, as Trotsky implies, or was it a mistake which springs from the very nature of Bolshevist political organization, which concentrates power in the hands of a small group of politicians so well insulated (by a hierarchic, bureaucratic party apparatus) against pressure from the masses that they don’t respond to the needs of the masses – until too late? Even when one of the leaders is able correctly to judge the needs of the masses, he can only try to persuade his colleagues of the correctness of his views. If they can’t be persuaded, he is inhibited by his political philosophy from appealing to the rank and file for support. It is true, as Trotsky writes, that the bourgeoisie would have sought to profit by any division in the ranks of the Bolsheviks. But are not the dangers of an air-tight dictatorship, insulated against mass pressure, even greater? Are not episodes like Kronstadt inevitable under such conditions? And would a Stalinist clique be able so easily to usurp control of a party which allowed greater participation to the masses and greater freedom to left-wing opposition, both inside and outside the dominant party?
These are the questions which Kronstadt raises. Trotsky does not answer them when he summarizes:
“In essence, the gentlemen critics are opponents of the dictatorship of the proletariat and by that token are opponents of the revolution. In this lies the whole secret.”
The secret is more complicated than this formulation. Rosa Luxemburg all her life opposed Lenin’s conception of the dictatorship of the proletariat. But the Guard officers who assassinated her in 1919 knew very well what her attitude was towards the 1917 revolution.
NEW YORK CITY, April 26, 1938
 



THE CHIEF IMPRESSION one gets from this month’s columnists is that it is a complicated world we live in – and getting more so every day. As the crisis of capitalist democracy sharpens, the clash of economic interests, the conflict of social classes and their ideologies become more and more confused. Consider the case of Boake Carter, who has just lost his job as news commentator on the General Foods radio program. The liberal columnist Dorothy Dunbar Bromley thinks there was dirty work involved and asks for an investigation. For this, she is violently abused by her fellow liberal columnist, Heywood Broun. The angles in the Carter affair are enough to give one a headache. Carter is a virulent critic of both the CIO and the New Deal. This pleases Colby M. Chester, president of General Foods and former president of the National Association of Manufacturers. But one of the directors of General Foods and owner of 12% of its common stock is Marjorie Post Hutton Davies, who is also the wife of Joseph Davies, 100% New Dealer and recently ambassador to the Soviet Union. There is evidence that the Davieses brought New Deal pressure to bear on President Chester to let Carter’s contract lapse. So far, a clean-cut victory for righteousness. But Boake Carter, for reasons not clear, is also a critic of collective security, a Big Navy, and the Administration’s imperialistic foreign policy, and the reactionary State Department is supposed to have played a big part in forcing him off the air. The line-up is thus: on one side, the State Department, a large section of liberal and labor opinion, Marjorie Post Hutton Davies, and the Communist Party; on the other, President Chester, the National Association of Manufacturers, and another large section of liberal and labor opinion which opposes a new war to make the world safe for democracy.

Nowhere has confusion been worse confounded than in the current Democratic primaries. Here the contradictions of the New Deal have emerged with tragic – or comic – effect. Last winter the liberals were hoping – and therefore, as is their custom, predicting – that Roosevelt would create a New Deal party, sloughing off the right wing of the Democratic Party and adding progressive Republicans like Norris and LaFollette. The battle lines between the Forces of Good and the Forces of Evil would thus be clearly drawn, and the New Deal could really get somewhere. The liberals forgot – also as is their custom – that it is the essence of Roosevelt’s strategy that the battle lines not be drawn sharply and that the New Deal progress in ever more grandiose circles. The primaries ought to dispel any illusions on the subject. The President’s much-advertised “purge” – except in such cases of pressing political necessity as Senators George and Tydings and Representative O’Connor – has boiled down to a matter of Roosevelt’s punishing his “enemies” within the party by referring to them as “my friend” instead of “my dear friend”. The Battle of Armageddon has turned out to be a routine political manoeuvre. Far from being clarified, this political meaning of the New Deal has been increasingly obscured. In California, the President is backing McAdoo, a Baruch Democrat who opposed his nomination in 1932, against a liberal EPIC leader who backed his nomination in 1932. In Tennessee, the conservative Senator McKellar and the notorious Ed Crump, immemorial boss of Memphis, successfully defended the New Deal against the onslaught of Senator Berry, head of the printing pressmen’s union and formerly president of Labor’s Non-Partisan League. In Pennsylvania the CIO fights it out with New Deal Governor Earle, each supported by a group of disreputable old-line politicians. In Idaho a conservative Democrat beats out a New Dealer with the help of votes from the state’s Republicans – and from the Townsendites. And in New Jersey, the New Deal has joined hands with Mayor Hague’s political machine to nominate for senator the state’s WPA administrator, W.H.J. Ely. Battles like these, meaningless except in terms of immediate power politics, have, been going on all over the country. It is a discouraging summer for liberals. The columnists have labored heroically to “interpret” these mighty struggles of Tweedledee versus Tweedledum. Mark Sullivan rejoices over another victory for the forces of sanity in the morning, and Jay Franklin announces another smashing defeat for Bourbonism in the evening. Confusion reached a climax when O’Daniel won the Democratic nomination for Governor of Texas on a platform of hillbilly music, the Ten Commandments, and old age pensions. Sullivan explained that O’Daniel was a big flour manufacturer and a past president of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce, in a column headed:
O’DANIEL VICTORY LAID NOT TO SHOWMANSHIP BUT TO STRESS ON BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS.
But the same event seemed to Jay Franklin a defeat of the conservative Garner state machine by a candidate who spoke the language of “The People”. He suggested it would be well “to put the Roosevelt brand on the O’Daniel candidacy”. Franklin, by the way, seems to have a weakness for hillbilly demagogues – cf. his often expressed admiration for the late Huey Long.

As befits the political wiseacre of the country’s most authoritative newspapers, the NY Times, Arthur Krock never forgets his dignity. His tone is dispassionate, urbane, judicial. At most he permits himself such phrases as “the serpentine and furtive course pursued by the Administration politicians in the Democratic primaries”. In a dignified way, he has been carrying on a campaign to amend the Wagner Act. He points out that now that the Supreme Court has sustained the Act, “the only corrective lies in the legislative process”. Translated into plainer language, this means that in the short space of a year, Congress and the Supreme Court have changed roles in the melodrama which the press daily sets in motion: Congress is now the wavy-haired hero who is looked to as the rescuer of the lovely Miss American Way from the immoral embraces of a liberalized Supreme Court. So we find Krock urging Senator Wagner to keep his splendid liberal record unsmirched by running for reelection this fall on a platform promising – revision of the Wagner Act.
Sullivan and Kent plume themselves on their profound knowledge of the political game. “Amateur politicians!” is Kent’s contemptuous description of Roosevelt’s liberal advisers. Not the least cause of these gentlemen’s irritation with the New Deal is that, by all their rules, it should have been swept out of office years ago. Yet it persists in flourishing. They view Roosevelt much as the British rowing experts look on Mr. Burk, the New Jersey farmer who recently won the Henley regatta in record time although he violated every principle of rowing form.


A THOUGHT FOR THIS MONTH
(or)
VOX POPULI
“Better wages, better sanitation, and better education will add much to the standard of living of the people as a whole.” Eleanor Roosevelt, July 27.
“I may be an idealist, but I feel that Mr. Landon belongs far more in the Roosevelt camp than he does in the present GOP, and I should like to see the President offer responsible and patriotic employment to the man he defeated in 1936 ... Perhaps Mr. Landon could serve on the National Labor Relations Board.” Jay Franklin, August 10.
“President Cardenas is an Indian, and Indian Communism ... is a very different thing from Marxian Communism. I am reliably informed that Trotsky, who is in Mexico, doesn’t regard Mr. Cardenas as a Communist at all.” Hugh Johnson, August 16.
“Though the moral condition of Europe has become progressively degraded, there is no reason to think that things are yet so bad that the honor of Great Britain, when clearly and decisively engaged, is of no account.” Walter Lippmann, July 28, apropos of the Runciman Mission to sell out the Czechs to Hitler.
“Excessive migration to the cities is one of the causes of the commotion through which the country is passing. Mark Sullivan, July 19.
“No government in our history ever had the degree of cooperation from business that was given Mr. Roosevelt in 1930. He simply asked over the radio one night for a voluntary maximum hours and minimum wages schedule and the abolition of child labor. He got it to the tune of nearly 3,000,000 jobs within the week.” Hugh Johnson, July 26.
“It is a fact insufficiently perceived that a vote for prosperity is a vote for depression because it concedes the government the power to dictate the economic life of the nation.” Isabel Paterson, July 27.


Among the liberal columnists, by far the best job is being done by a newcomer: Dorothy Dunbar Bromley, who several months ago left the Woman’s Page of the NY World-Telegram to do a column of general news comment for the NY Post. While Franklin is explaining why Senator Gulch of Arkansas is a staunch New Dealer despite his participation in a recent lynching, and Broun is being whimsical about the class struggle at the Miami race track, Bromley takes up such serious themes as the working conditions of servants, the union-smashing campaign of certain big New York hospitals, the AMA fight on socialized medicine (pointing out, by the way, that a bigger percentage of mothers die in childbirth in this country than in any other civilized nation), and the sub rosa loans which the government’s Export-Import Bank has been making to various South American dictatorships. This sort of muckraking should be part of every left-wing columnist’s job. Bromley is also distinguished among her liberal colleagues by the possession of both courage and intellectual honesty. She is critical of Stalinism both in the USSR and the USA – and says so. She thinks the American Labor Party has prostituted itself in its deal with the Republicans in New York – and says so. Recently she put comrade Broun and the League for Peace & You-know in a neat hole by asking the simple question: if you are such believers in democracy, why aren’t you willing to let the people decide about collective security for themselves through the Ludlow Amendment?
To date, both parties have ignored the question.

When Dorothy Thompson went on vacation early this summer, the editors of the NY Herald-Tribune turned her space over to Isabel Paterson. Miss Paterson is a lady book reviewer who used to conduct a literary chitchat department in the book section. On the strength of this background, she is now telling the world her views on price-fixing, monopoly, taxation, wartime conscription, and the “real” nature of capitalism. Her prose is even more exclamatory than her predecessor’s, her store of worldly knowledge even slighter. Her stuff, in fact, represents the all-time nadir of the Thompson-Pegler-Johnson “home talent” school of poltical columnism. The incoherence of her style and viewpoint is only equalled by the dogmatism with which she lays down the law.
“INDUSTRY WARNED WAGE SLASHES MUST BE PREVENTED AT ALL COSTS: Isabel Paterson Says Existing Scales Are Certainly Not Too High to Live On, and Can Be Kept Up if ‘Waste and Political Grab’ Are Ended.”
And that is that. Miss Paterson has had her Big Moments. The President mentioned her column in a recent press conference. “He laughingly remarked that she seemed to be for monopoly,” the papers reported. The next day, Miss Paterson, obviously thrilled to the marrow, wrote a column explaining to the President that no, indeed, she was not for monopoly, but.... Her train of thought, too involved to follow here, was headlined:
“HOW CAN LAW, ITSELF RESTRAINT, PREVENT RESTRAINT OF TRADE?”
The question seems well-nigh unanswerable.
But the really Big Moment came when she refuted both Adam Smith and Karl Marx in a single column. “ALL TALK GLIBLY ABOUT ‘CAPITAL’ – BUT WHAT DOES IT REALLY MEAN?” ran the head:
“Isabel Paterson Says Both Adam Smith and Marx May Be Wrong: Wealth Isn’t Just Machinery, but Relationships That Make It Function.”
It seems that in Marx’s time, machinery was more durable both as to wear and obsolescence than it is today. Miss Paterson graphically demonstrates this by referring to an ancient sewing machine she owns – 
“If I don’t set a stitch for a year, it runs well enough when I start it again. I don’t know when it was last oiled.”
On the other hand, “if a motor car of recent make were left in the garage for an equal period, it would be long past use.” Therefore:
“In Marx’s time, it was natural to think of industrial capital as something essentially physical, fairly durable, and capable of being seized and taken over for the benefit of a new political system.”
Modern capitalism, however, is dynamic – imagine! – and its essence lies not in the physical machinery but in the social forms under which production is organized. Hence, revolution is impossible – as simple as that. We may shortly expect Miss Paterson to discover that capitalism produces wars – a fact Marx unfortunately was born too early to understand.
The late Arthur Brisbane’s columnar style has been compared to the conversation of two traveling men, relaxing in a saloon after a hard day on the road. (The asterisks Brisbane used so liberally would correspond to pauses to spit on the sawdust floor.) Miss Paterson reminds one of a schoolmistress, maidenly and severe. She raps backward pupils sharply over the knuckles with her ruler, she scribbles her simple texts vigorously on the blackboard. That dunce, Frankie Roosevelt, gives her much trouble. A recent column bore the blunt headline: 
“A WASTEFUL WIFE AND ROOSEVELT FOUND TO HAVE MUCH IN COMMON.”
“The spendthrift cannot be convinced or reformed,” concluded Miss Paterson primly. “The only recourse is to avoid him.” Sometimes she loses all patience with the class, as when she recently burst out, “What is the matter with Europe, anyhow?” The odd thing about this school is that the teacher seems to be educating herself as she goes along. Miss Paterson’s columns are so much thinking-out-loud inflicted on the public. It would be interesting to know – as a rough index of the political sophistication of the big bourgeoisie – how seriously the readers of the Tribune take her stuff.

The Collective security boys found deep, though conflicting significance in the Hughes round-the-world flight. Heywood Broun pronounced it “a victory for democracy”. Jay Franklin, equally delighted, wrote:
“It won’t be long now before our Atlantic Coast will be as exposed to European raiders as are the coasts of England today.”

These volumes are the latest brochures of those quacks who guarantee to extract from capitalism its “evils” without causing the slightest pain to the patient. Jerome Frank, once of AAA and now of SEC, compounds a shotgun mixture: semantics plus “folklore of capitalism” plus economic isolation plus increasing doses of the New Deal. Brookings presents its famous nostrum, the “Brookings Thesis”: bigger production and lower prices. The Harvard scholars make no general recommendation, but seem to think all will be well if the Federal budget is balanced, accounting practices are revised, and more attention paid by business men to “the human factor”. Naturally, these doctors don’t always agree. But it is remarkable how often they do. Thus Frank, on the left wing of the New Deal, agrees with Professor Slichter of Harvard and with the conservative Brookings Institution on the big-value-at-low-prices panacea. (Frank and Slichter add government spending as a shot in the arm.) All three books present business men as free agents, acting with almost complete liberty of individual choice. All three see the capitalist system as affected as much by psychological as by economic factors. Hence all three are addressed to business men, who are urged to make certain reforms in the system – in order to make bigger profits. This approach is to be expected. Most Americans with access to pen and printing press still believe it is possible to “save” capitalism, and to do it without recourse to anything as unpleasant as fascism. What the considerable body of Americans without access to print think about all this is another, and more difficult, question, the answer to which will be found in none of these weighty volumes.

The fourteen members of the faculty of the Harvard Business School who contribute the essays in Business and Modern Society speak with the authority of high priests in the innermost temple of Mammon. The pretentious title is hardly justified: most of the articles are on a purely technical level, with only a side-bow to “society”. But the point is that such a title was thought desirable, that even side-bows are made. A few years ago these discussions of currency problems and cost accounting would have been served up without any sociological dressing. The depression has at least made business men – and their economists – aware that they function in a social mileu.
The opening paper, Material Progress and Social Discontent, supplies the ideological thread on which the other essays are loosely strung. Its author is the Dean of the business school, Wallace B. Donham, who is also “George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Economics”. As an intellectual performance, it is on the level of a high school valedictory address. But as an indication of the new strategy of the class Dean Donham speaks to and for, it is of the greatest interest. He strikes the note at once:
“Nothing is clearer than that men cannot live by bread alone, still less by gold. There is no necessary or even probable correlation between material wealth and contentment ... Happiness for most of us is to be found only in a state of mind.”
Why does Donham utter these particular platitudes at this particular time? He suggests the answer when he writes:
“The year 1929 may be taken as marking conveniently the end of a century of logics and of scientific revolutions dominated by systematic thinking.”
In 1929 American capitalism began to break down decisively. Since that year, it has become increasingly obvious that it can provide only unemployment and subhuman living standards for an ever-larger proportion of the nation’s citizens. It is, of course, impossible for Donham to admit this. Although even in 1929, 42 per cent of American families had incomes below the “health and decency” minimum of $1,500 a year, Donham insists:
“Free income above necessities is in America widespread ...”
But, since he cannot deny there is increasing social unrest, he is driven to the extraordinary conclusion that despite material well-being, “envy, fear, unhappiness, and class hatreds grip vast numbers of people”. This paradox he can only explain by vague references to “human nature”, a mysterious and perverse force. This belittling of material factors in favor of “psychology” runs all through the volume, which presents the ludicrous spectacle of a group of economists laboriously demonstrating the fallibility and irrelevance of the science they profess. “Economic devices,” states Donham, “will not solve our social problems.” The nine-year collapse of American capitalism is rationalized away as a moral, a spiritual, a psychological, an anything-but-economic crisis.
Donham’s advice to his bourgeois clients is to rely less on material concessions in the future, and more on propaganda. So far, this is no more than a defensive manoeuvre, expressing itself chiefly in advertising campaigns to “sell” business to the public. So far, Donham and his clients really believe their own rationalization: capitalism could still produce plenty for everybody – if only the spiritual crisis can be resolved!
“The material opportunities offered by the new frontiers of science and industry are not in question,” writes Donham. “These are unlimited ... The doubts are on the social side ... Can we rebuild social morale in time?”
Donham is still vague as to how “social morale” may best be rebuilt. But as the frontiers he counts on turn out one after another to be illusions – first it was radio that was to “save” capitalism ... then air transport ... then electrical refrigeration ... and most recently, air conditioning – it is not difficult to predict a more positive content to the Dean’s speculations. “The ways of God will always pass human understanding,” we read – and, a few lines down the page:
“There is some reason to believe that the long hours and hard living which are the present lot of German workmen are in themselves a source of strength to Nazi Germany, because they have restored self-respect and comfort to great numbers who had lost these essentials.”
(The restoration of “self respect” via long hours and the “comfort” that grows out of “hard living” are mysteries that had better be left to Him whose ways pass all human understanding.) Later on, he becomes more specific:
“A high material standard of living is itself a disorganizing factor ... In the problems encountered in establishing effective social morale, there is a clear distinction to be drawn between a well-integrated community, made up largely of people with narrow margins, and the modern industrial community, typical of America, where a large proportion of the people have the freedom of choice offered, for example, by the automobile.”
That is, the bourgeoisie can more easily maintain its rule (“establish effective social morale”) if the masses have not been “spoiled” by too great material concessions. And what is desirable in any case becomes a downright necessity in a declining capitalist order which is unable to make such concessions. This is generally known as “fascism”.
Donham and his clients are by no means ready to put it, even to themselves, as bluntly as that. They still boast of the high standard of living American capitalism has given the workers, they still preach the desirability of automobiles and radios for the masses. But there is an evident contradiction between such boasting and the contention that “happiness” and “social morale” don’t depend on material goods. In Donham’s essay, the bourgeois ideology of the past and of the future appear side by side, for the moment unconscious of their mutual exclusiveness. As American capitalism decays, this cultural lag will be overcome, and the contradiction will be resolved by sloughing off the antiquated ideology of materialism. Rationalism will yield to mysticism, scientific logic to spiritual values. The American standard of living will be soft-pedaled, and the “disorganizing” effects of materialistic plenty will be emphasized. This essay is an attempt to prepare the ground for such a manoeuvre. It indicates that the American business class is beginning to learn what the European bourgeoisie were forced to discover years ago: that the last line of capitalist defense is to shift the battle to non-materialistic terrain.
This note reappears in the other contributions to Business and Modern Society. An article on Business Cycle Theories, by one of the editors, declares that the “driving force” behind the wild fluctuations of capitalist production is “furnished by mass psychology” ... In an article entitled The Effect of Direct Charges to Surplus on the Measurement of Income we read:
“The whole spirit of the business community is influenced by income figures, usually without any ... realization that they are largely an expression of judgment.”
Thus even accounting practice, the basic capitalist logic, is viewed with corrosive scepticism ... Sumner H. Slichter, the leader of the “left-wing” group in the business school, advocates certain accounting changes because they “would help to stabilize the emotions, and, therefore, the expenditures of business managers”. Not content with that, he goes on to suggest that consumption, and hence profits, depend on “the willingness of individuals to spend”. In hard times, “business enterprises and their owners are probably less disposed than wage earners to spend their incomes promptly,” he writes – as though the superior “willingness” of wage earners to spend were not due entirely to the simple fact that they must eat! ... Logics and Emotions in Marketing analyzes the chain store-vs.-independent struggle as a clash of logic (chains) with emotion (independents). The retailers’ fight for economic survival is actually characterized as “emotional social opposition”, and the unionization drive of chain store employees is called “another stream of emotional antagonism”. A strange and wonderful world is this which the faculty of the Harvard Business School inhabit, quite unlike the humdrum atmosphere of wages and money-making most of us know ... An article with the innocuous title, Modern Price Regulation, turns out to be a plea for what is euphemistically called “national capitalism”.
“The fundamental trouble with capitalism in its older forms is that the rank and file of people cannot measure up to its requirements.” (They are, it seems, “abominable managers” and also “incapable”.)
Hence the business men must extend their control over the State and bring about “a new expression of social justice”.

Four years ago the Brookings Institution, which is to bourgeois economics what the French Academy is to bourgeois art, published two exhaustive studies of American capitalism. The first, America’s Capacity to Produce, established one basic, and, considering the impeccable respectability of its source, startling fact: that in the boom year 1929, the American industrial plant was operating at less than 80% of capacity. The second, America’s Capacity to Consume, established a complementary fact: that in 1929 only 20% of America’s families had incomes of over $3,000 a year, while 60% had less than $2,000 and 40% less than $1,500. Shocked by its own discoveries, the Institution set out to find a remedy – a respectable one, that is. This was announced in 1935 in a volume entitled Income and Economic Progress. Popularized by Fortune as “The Brookings Thesis”, this is probably the most generally accepted solution for American capitalism’s current difficulties. All right-thinking, forward-looking citizens, from the left wing of the New Deal to the “economic royalist”, E.T. Weir (who helped finance the Brookings studies) agree on the Brookings Thesis as The Way Out. It is a simple enough formula: Given, an economy in which profits depend on sales and sales depend on mass purchasing power; and Given, huge and costly industrial plants with a high ratio of fixed capital, which make a great deal of money when operated above the “break-even” point (between 40% and 50% of capacity in steel, for example), and lose even larger amounts when operated below that point; Then, it is more profitable to sell more goods at lower prices than to sell less goods at higher prices. Twentieth century capitalism, in a word, must abandon the old “scarcity economics” and reorganize itself as an economy of abundance. That this “thesis” should be taken so seriously today is curious considering that it is little more than a restatement of the once-famous “New Era” theory developed by Waddill Catchings and W.T. Foster in the golden twenties. According to Messrs. Foster and Catchings, Coolidgean prosperity was to last forever, because of the increasingly wider distribution of purchasing power made possible by modern mass production. The investment banking house of Goldman, Sachs, which was unfortunate enough to number Mr. Catchings among its partners, all by itself furnished ample disproof of this theory in the 1929-32 collapse. The fatal flaw in the theory is that it assumes the indefinite existence of an economic frontier which will absorb profitably the ever greater profits realized by this ever greater production. How this frontier can be maintained so long as the masses fail to receive back in purchasing power at least as much as they produce as workers – an impossibility by definition under a profit system – this is a problem which neither Fortune, nor the New Deal, nor the Economic Royalists, nor the wise men of Brookings have yet been able to solve. [1]
Industrial Price Policies and Economic Progress is an attempt at a detailed exposition of the Brookings Thesis. The preceding volumes, the authors explain in their Introduction, were studies of how the economic system actually works – “no attempt was made to draw up a plan for some new kind of economic world”. Here at last, then, is How To Do It. But something seems to have happened between the inception of the book and its execution. Nourse and Drury may have started out to make a blueprint of “some new kind of economic world”, but what they have actually produced is a justification of the kind of economic world we have had for the last twenty years. They are at great pains to show, in a series of deodorized case histories, that since the War, the great monopolistic industries – excepting steel, whose price policies are too rank for even Brookings to whitewash – have reduced prices and increased production just as the Brookings Thesis requires. The question then naturally arises: if the Thesis is The Way Out, and if big business has been applying it since 1918, why did the hoops burst in 1929? In order to justify the ways of corporations to man, Nourse and Drury demolish the strongest argument in favor of their theory: that it has never been tried. To make it still more confusing, they have had to falsify the record in order to accomplish this. For it is a fact, despite all their special pleading, that their theory never has been adequately tried.
Their manoeuvre, however, is not as insane as it sounds. It is perhaps no coincidence that their book presents a lengthy and detailed defense of the price policies of two monopolistic groups which are currently under indictment on Federal antitrust charges: the oil companies and the Mellon aluminum trust. The Senate monopoly investigation, furthermore, is expected to concentrate on the price policies of big business. It would seem that the wise men of Brookings have chosen to sabotage their own theory in an effort to protect their patrons against Governmental action. They have made the supreme academic sacrifice. Business is business. [2]

Jerome Frank’s Save America First is a showcase of ideas currently fashionable in liberal circles. There is a little of Thurman Arnold’s anthropological whimsy, a lot of semantics (the book was originally to be called, The Dictatorship of the Vocabulary), and much New Deal philosophizing. Such a book, naturally, has greatly fluttered the liberal dovecotes. “One of those exciting books that can shape the thinking of an epoch,” declares John Chamberlain. “The most exciting volume of our day!” echoes Morris Ernst, while Stuart Chase contributes: “Exciting reading ! It is the kind of book this age needs.” Save America First, one gathers, is exciting. So is a pack of firecrackers in action. But neither is very coherent, and neither gets anywhere in particular.
In nothing is Save America First a more typical product of contemporary American liberalism than in its extreme disorganization. Frank is a dilettante of ideas, toying with a number of bright-colored concepts without relating them and without getting below their surface. Insofar as he has a main theme, it is that America is a country big enough and rich enough and democratic enough to create and support within its borders a self-contained capitalist economy of abundance. (The reviewers have failed to mention the interesting similarity of this idea to the “America Self Contained” propaganda which Samuel Crowther has been putting out for years on behalf of the reactionary Chemical Foundation group.) He admits that living standards are still low and that the vast internal market is still largely potential, but he thinks all this may be remedied and the “profit system”, as he delicately calls capitalism, may be “saved” if

we stop trading in good ideas with the rest of the world, thus freeing ourselves from the ruin now overhanging Europe;
business acts on the Brookings Thesis;
the New Deal extends its pump priming and business regulating activities still further.
That American capitalism is in any position today to get along without foreign markets would seem to be branded an illusion by the imperialistic Big Navy and Good Neighbor policies of that very New Deal which Frank so much admires. (He says not a word about these policies in his book.) But granting the point for the sake of argument, how is the new order to be brought to pass? Frank has nothing more concrete to offer than “a new spirit of cooperation” which
“... must be worked out in the form of concrete administrative devices ... by which the several industries meet, and confer, and work with one another and the government on their price and production schedules ... When that is done, a spirit of coöperativeness will be the inevitable result. That spirit is indispensable if our civilization is to remain civilized.”
This is “the old crap” of NRA all over again, and the sort of cooperation business will once more expect – and get – is the kind the lamb gives to the tiger when it doesn’t struggle too violently.
Frank admits – how can he not? – that something went wrong with the NRA experiment. But this time, he says hopefully, business must be educated really to coöperate. Since he does not recognize any necessary class conflict along economic lines, he can conceive of no reason for what he politely terms “the powerful minority” opposing the interests of The People except either ignorance or sheer perversity. Rejecting perversity as a general explanation, he concludes that capitalism has turned out badly so far because capitalists have never been informed as to their own best interests. His book is an attempt to educate them. Ignoring historical factors, he naively trusts to the power of pure reason to change the world.
“We should invite the younger business rulers ... to throw off the shackles of thought habits which dominate many of their elders.”
One is reminded of the Utopian socialist, Robert Owen, who wasted so many years trying to persuade dukes and stockbrokers they would be better off in his cooperative commonwealth. But Owen at least had the excuse that he lived before Marx.
“Our business rulers,” writes Frank, “for their own sake, must frankly face and help to solve the problems posed by the nature of our profit system as it is now constituted.”
That their European colleagues frankly faced and solved similar problems with fascism – this is irrelevant. “America,” writes Frank, “is not Europe.” A statement that is semantically meaningless.
“For America, fascism is a lunatic program ... Business rulers will write themselves down absurdly stupid if they do not cooperate in finding better contrivances.”
But from the business man’s viewpoint, fascism is by no means a “lunatic program”, and if Frank wants to call industrialists like Ford and Weir “absurdly stupid” because they are using semi-fascist strong-arm squads and “citizens’ committees” to smash unionism, he must explain how they come to be also the chief exponents of that “Brookings Thesis” he advocates. The same applies to those “evils” of capitalism he would eliminate by educating the bosses: they are “evils” only from the viewpoint of society as a whole; from the bosses’ viewpoint, they are virtues. But, rejecting the class struggle, Frank can admit no such contradiction. “We are sacrificing ourselves to superstitions as absurd as witchcraft,” he writes. But if unreformed capitalism were so palpably “stupid” and “absurd” from the viewpoint of the rulers as well as of the ruled, it would have ceased to exist many years ago. The Frank-Chase-Arnold approach is a frivolous underestimation of the problem.
Frank talks a lot about the necessity for cracking big words open and seeing what is inside them. Such words he calls “wousins”. But there is one very small word he uses constantly which he should crack open some day for closer inspection: the word, “we” – as in “We must not let the Old Guard use verbal sleight of hand on us .... We must challenge their right ...” Who is this “we”, precisely? It seems to stand vaguely for “society” or “the American people”. But this is the most outrageous “wousin” of them all: there is no such entity as “the American people” or “society in general”. There are social classes, occupational and regional groups, employers and employees, etc. But it would endanger Frank’s whole conception to think concretely in terms of just what economic interests any given “we” represents.
As an ardent New Dealer, Frank is as anxious as any Republican to conceal the economic disintegration of American capitalism. His book contains no statistical data, no analysis of social and economic forces in concrete terms. It does not even broach the crucial question: is American capitalism still growing or is it entering on a permanent decline? Instead, Frank gives us – psychology. The Dean of the Harvard Business School calls the depression “an emotional sickness”, and Frank writes: “A depression in America is a mental, not an economic, phenomenon.” Hoover talked about “restoring confidence”; Roosevelt said, “We have nothing to fear but fear itself”; and Frank writes, “To stop the progress of the sickening cycle that leads to fascism and civil war, it is necessary that false fears be promptly eradicated.” The motor force in capitalism he sees as – vanity:
“Some of our business statesmen will never acquiesce in reform because to do so would involve a tacit admission that their predepression ways of running our economy were faulty. They feel that any such admission reflects on their judgment.”
In conservative thinking, this psychological approach to economic problems leads straight to fascism. In liberals like Frank, it paralyzes what powers of resistance they have.
Although he affects to dismiss Marxism as an exploded theory of no significance to “different” America, Frank nonetheless devotes considerable space to attacking it. His main criticisms are three:

it is “fatalistic” in charting the inevitable course of capitalism;
it exaggerates the role of economic factors in history;
Marx generalized about capitalism exclusively on the basis of English experience, and so his conclusions are invalid for America.
The first point seems to me to have the most merit, but Frank pushes it to such extremes as to suggest he thinks of Marxism as a variety of religious mysticism. I can see little in his second point: such exaggerations are inescapable in any original theoretical thinking. (Frank also critcises Freud for “over-emphasizing” the role of sex.) It is laboring the obvious to point them out, and it is the height of unimaginative Philistinism to “reject” Marxism or Freudism on such grounds. As for (3), if Frank objects to Marx studying capitalism in the land of its classic development, he must also reject a great many medical discoveries made through experiments on guinea pigs: America is not Europe, and guinea pigs are not human beings. I suggest that these “reasons” for rejecting Marxism might more properly be called rationalizations, and that Frank’s aversion to Marxism can be referred to nothing more complicated than the fact that Marxism threatens the present economic order, to which the liberal, for all his grumblings, is fundamentally loyal. In a period of crisis such as the present, this basic loyalty comes unmistakably to the surface. Save America First would have been a much bolder and more “radical” book had it been written ten years ago.
To Marxist “fatalism”, Frank opposes the Accident Theory of History. “The central fact in human history,” he writes, “is its unpredictability.” Although he seems unconscious of the fact, the main reason he finds history so unpredictable is that he locates its motive power not in geography, not in economics, not even in Hegelian “ideas”, but in the actions of Great Men. If Sir Robert Peel, he argues, for personal reasons “we will never know”, had not deserted the Tories and led the fight to repeal the Corn Laws, “England’s significant move into free trade would not have been made”. As though the rising English bourgeosie would not have put through its basic program, Peel or no Peel! This childish parlor game of “If Napoleon had won at Waterloo ...”, which reduces history to a meaningless series of accidents, Frank seriously counterposes to the materialistic interpretation of history.
Why this great concern to demonstrate the accidental pattern of history? Why this anxiety to emphasize the fallibility of Marx and other social theorists? Why this insistence that history and economics are “arts” rather than “sciences”? It is possible that Frank has an uneasy consciousness that his panacea will not stand theoretical analysis, that the overwhelming weight of historical experience is against him. Hence he cries, with Henry Ford: “History is bunk!” And indeed, as conceived by such philistines, history is bunk.
 
Footnotes
1. This it to say nothing of such comparatively minor problems aa how to carry mechanization and rationalization much farther without causing a disastrous increase in technological unemployment. It is also worth noting that the best known exponents of the Brookings Thesis in industry have been able to exploit certain peculiar and limited economic “frontiers”. Thus Ford was lucky enough to get in on the ground floor of the one remaining major frontier of twentieth century capitalism: the automobile. Now that this is closing, Ford is suffering just like any unenlightened industrialist.
2. It is only fair to note that at least one section of this book is excellent: Appendix E, which is a reprint of an article on steel price policy published two years ago in Fortune. Of course, I may be prejudiced. I wrote it.
 



THIS MONTH I PROPOSE to follow chiefly the conservative columnists: Frank R. Kent, whose The Great Game of Politics is syndicated to 112 papers; David Lawrence (Today in Washington – 100 papers), Mark Sullivan (54 papers) and Arthur Krock, whose column in the New York Times is not syndicated hut has a nationwide influence because so many small town editors take their cue from the Times. The output of this group is on the dull side compared to that of the gloriously confused centrist school of Lippmann-Pegler-Thompson-Johnson, just as integrated personalities are often less interesting than schizoids. Their definitely fixed right-wing position doesn’t allow them the brilliant rationalization, the remarkable intellectual manoeuvres of the centrists. They also labor under the handicap of knowing their field thoroughly – Time long ago demonstrated that amateurs can always write more intriguingly on any subject than experts. Lawrence, still in his early forties, is the editor of the United States Daily, a specialized paper, designed for business men, which reports on the day-by-day course of government in Washington. Kent is a veteran political writer and the author of several excellent books on American politics. Sullivan has been writing on national politics for some forty years. His six volume work, Our Times, a running journalistic chronicle of post-1900 events, is well known. Krock is the head of the Washington bureau of the Times.
These men write with an impersonal weight of authority which, among the centrists, only Lippmann can achieve. On specific issues, what they write is often acute. But they are as confused as any Liberty Leaguer by the broader aspects of contemporary politics. Their blindness is basic: a failure to recognize that the capitalism of the Coolidge era can no longer satisfy the needs of society and that some major modification is necessary. This failure, of course, derives from the fact that to them “the American people” means the handful who have incomes of $5,000 a year or over. This obtuseness may render them highly immoral, from a Popular Front-New Deal viewpoint, but it also renders them highly ineffective.
Trustworthy on details, these columnists are dangerously misleading – from the bourgeois point of view – when it comes to larger issues. Every year their political approach becomes more academic, every year it presents less possibility of solving capitalism’s problems. So long as the bourgeoisie continues to follow tile lead of such writers – and of their counterparts now in control of the Republican party – the danger of fascism is remote. But when the business community turns from Lawrence and Sullivan to Pegler and Johnson, from Hoover and Landon to LaGuardia and the National Progressives, then the threat of fascism will become really serious. Meanwhile, it is safe to predict that the New Deal will remain securely entrenched in power, for all Mark Sullivan’s brave whistling in the dark to the tune of 120 additional Republican seats in the next Congress. It is reactionaries and not conservatives who are to be feared by the Left.
* * *
The impotence of the conservative position is illustrated by Lawrence’s June 27 column, which attacks the New Deal as “an experiment in State Socialism” and which concludes with a call to arms:
“Clean government, moral government, honest elections, complete divorcement of governmental power from any control of the voting system of America furnish issues of public policy and public morality as old as democracy itself. They are the only real issues in the 1938 congressional campaign.”
It is hardly necessary to point out that any candidate rash enough to campaign on such issues would be snowed under – were his opponent Earl Browder himself. The Laurentian approach is unrealistic from both the long and the short range viewpoints. From the long term view, the victory of “clean” and “moral” government would have about as much effect on capitalism’s vast problems as a reorganization of the US Forestry Service. And considered as an immediate political manoeuvre, Lawrence’s slogans are to those of the New Deal as ice water is to straight whiskey.
* * *
There is evidently a double standard of political as well as of sexual morality. The favorite theme of the columnists of the center and right last month was the sinfulness of President Roosevelt’s intervention in the Democratic primaries. But nothing was said about one reason for his intervening: the fact that some of his bitterest Senatorial opponents have not been above claiming his support in their primary battles.
“Most politicians,” writes Krock casually, “find it essential to ... pay lip service to a President of their own party in the campaign, however much they may disagree with his policies.”
This is either a very cynical or a very naïve statement, depending on how highly one rates Mr. Krock’s intelligence.
* * *
Kent and Sullivan vote the straight anti-New Deal ticket, refusing to admit that any good can come out of Nazareth. When Sullivan can’t find anything else to complain about, he writes a column about his pet hate, the AAA –
BUTTER FOR IDLE, OLEO FOR TOILERS CALLED SEQUEL OF AAA POLICY.
Kent seems to have a personal grudge against the entire New Deal, and an especially corrosive hatred of the President. Compared to these fire-eaters, Lawrence is sober, realistic, and judicial. Writing exclusively and consciously for business men – who read him for information rather than emotional release – Lawrence doesn’t hesitate to give the New Deal credit when its policies are “sound” – i.e., favorable to business. He admitted the Federal reorganization bill was a wise and necessary measure (though he blamed its failure to pass on Roosevelt for having aroused the “distrust” of Congress!). And while Kent was denouncing the pending monopoly investigation as “calculated demagoguery” and Johnson was fulminating about “a mass production of witch-finding with a St. Bartholomew’s massacre of all business opponents of the New Deal at the end”, Lawrence was predicting that the inquiry would be “reasonable” and “objective” and advising business men to cooperate. Later reports seem to indicate he was right in his appraisal.
But this superior insight applies only to details. Lawrence goes as haywire as any of them on large political issues. Like his colleagues, he is constantly seeing revolution under the bed. His June 20 column began:
“Within the last two weeks something so fundamental has happened in the history of the United States that it is doubtful whether the people generally realizes it ... Government in America has crossed the Rubicon.”
It turns out that he is referring to recent legislation on wages and hours, child labor, and flood control, which he thinks has violated states’ rights. Even allowing for a reasonable degree of journalistic exaggeration, the trump of doom Lawrence sounds is rather absurd. So long as its conservative opponents fight the battles on this juristic plane, the New Deal is in no danger.
“The new concept of government in America,” Lawrence continues, “is that a majority of both houses of Congress may at will disregard the basic rights of the minority, including property rights.”
He predicts that ultimately the masses, with a truly noble disinterestedness, will rise in their wrath and overthrow the New Deal, restoring to the minority its long-lost property rights. (Mr. Lawrence would no doubt object to Marxism as “idealistic”, “visionary”, and “contrary to human nature”.)


A THOUGHT FOR THIS MONTH
(or)
VOX POPULI
“The chief victims of the depression are the least numerous classes of the population.” Arthur Krock, June 17.
“I know of nobody well enough informed to have an opinion who does not believe that, with a fair degree of cooperation between government, labor and management, this depression could be turned the other way immediately.” Hugh Johnson, June 22.
“President Roosevelt’s speech before the National Education Association brought out to the full his great capacity as the articulate spokesman of American democracy. I have in mind the closing portion of his address in which he spoke of the burning of the books.” Heywood Broun, July 2. (EDITOR’S NOTE: President Roosevelt took a strong stand against book-burning.)
“We must have reached the stage in civilization where those of us who are not actually participating in a war can give something toward the help of needy children.” Eleanor Roosevelt, June 24.
“Industrial capital consists of enterprise and the human relations it creates. This, I think, is demonstrably true.” Isabel Paterson, July 13.
“Strictly speaking, poverty is a natural condition.” Isabel Paterson, June 27.
“The Democratic majority in the last Congress did nothing to alleviate the condition of the unemployed except to offer them more Federal funds.” David Lawrence, June 18.
“In all politics and all history, there is much that is fortuitous.” Mark Sullivan, June 16.
“The two rival factions within each party are by no means to be defined glibly by the words ‘liberal’ and ‘conservative’ but by the words ‘honest’ and ‘dishonest’.” David Lawrence, June 27.


These gentlemen still play on the antiquated pipe of laissez-faire liberalism not because of any moral repugnance to fascism but because the American bourgeoisie doesn’t need fascism yet – or doesn’t think it needs it. But already their thinking has begun to take on a faintly fascist tinge. This is especially noticeable in the crucial field of labor relations. Mark Sullivan, for example, is a plump, pink-cheeked, white-haired old gentleman who wears very high stiff collars, smokes a ruminative pipe, and, personally, is compact of genial benevolence. As nice an old gentleman as you’d care to meet. In his younger days, he was an intimate of Teddy Roosevelt, and he still thinks of himself as a bit of a liberal. All of which hasn’t prevented him from expressing approval of Boss Hague’s tactics. It is worth following his rather involved reasoning to see how the old-fashioned liberal can shade off into the fascist apologist.
“Just what the philosophy of CIO is,” he begins mildly enough, “I do not undertake to define. To attempt it would be to get involved in hairline refinements of what the radicals call ‘ideology’. Mayor Hague says the philosophy of CIO is communism. That is not true of all CIO, perhaps not of most of it. ... But let us confine ourselves to the actions of CIO. One early action was the sit-down strike. The sit-down strike is violence. True, the sit-down is only partial violence, what may be called ‘static violence’.”
He points out two ways of dealing with this “static violence” (a nice “hairline refinement of ideology”, by the way):

“It can be – and of course ought to be – suppressed by the state”;
failing that, vigilantes can do the job. (“Vigilante action,” he handsomely conceded, “is no more lawful than the sit-down strike.”)
“This brings us to Mayor Hague. His case is weaker than it would have been if he were a mayor of Michigan or in some other state. For, as far as we know, the Governor of New Jersey would suppress the violence of the CIO sit-down if and when it occurs.”
Therefore, one might conclude, Mayor Hague was in the wrong. But not at all:
“Mayor Hague did not wait for the actual violence to occur. He acted in advance of the violence ... Possibly some mayors in Michigan and other states wish they had acted in advance, instead of waiting until after the violence had occurred.”
What is this theory of “preventive violence” but a small-scale model of Franco’s “preventive counter-revolution”?
 



For years Marxists have been insisting that the fine professions of the liberals were a fraud, for years we have been prophesying that these highminded idealistic gentlemen would crack under the first real war pressure and line up enthusiastically with the reactionaries and imperialists they so boldly denounced in quiet times. For this harsh view of liberalism we have been called all sorts of names, from “cynics” to “sectarian fanatics.” Now the war pressure has come, suddenly and crushingly, and every morning’s paper is documenting our prophecies. Last week the New Republic announced the resignations of two of its editors, Lewis Mumford and Waldo Frank. They have resigned because they don’t think the New Republic is warlike enough. As far as one can tell from their vague and confused letters of resignation, they doubt the simon-pure quality of the New Republic’s anti-fascism and seem even to suspect that their fellow editors may be tainted with fifth columnitis.
Last week the papers carried a short item to the effect that Bertrand Russell has publicly renounced his pacifism and is now supporting His Majesty’s government in the war.
News now comes, in the New Leader (of London) for May 2, that Victor Gollancz, the British left-wing publisher whose Left Book Club was one of the most important Stalinist “innocent” organizations, and John Strachey, who must be counted as essentially a liberal despite his long service to Stalinism, have definitely left the Stalinist camp. They have run out so fast, indeed, that, as is often the case these days, their momentum has carried them clear into the middle of the British imperialist war camp.
“The disappointing thing,” writes Fenner Brockway sadly, “is that both Strachey and Gollancz have become pro-war on the British and French Side.” Poor old Brockway! What disappointments the next few months still have in store for him!
 
“The Frankfurter Decision”
The most complete job of moral hari-kari, however, was committed by Felix Frankfurter, defender of Sacco and Vanzetti, onetime “man behind the New Deal” and now a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. According to Uncensored, whose current issue tells the whole story, “Justice Frankfurter has become one of the most active and most emotional under-cover advocates of foreign intervention in the capital.” Last week Frankfurter drew the logical conclusion from his pro-war position: he wrote one of the most ominous and reactionary decisions that has lately come out of the Supreme Court. By a vote of 8 to 1 (the honorable dissenter was Justice Stone) the court decided that two school children, members of Jehovah’s Witnesses, must salute the American flag, despite religious scruples against doing so. Lined up with Frankfurter in handing down this decision were all the other “New Deal” justices – Black, Murphy, Reed, and Douglas. The recent trend of Supreme Court decisions in such civil liberties cases has been liberal, but the war is really serious now and the smiling puppet-master in the White House is in no mood for any fooling around. His “boys” on the bench are showing they know how to behave.
One of the organizations which helped defend the non-flag-saluters was the American Civil Liberties Union. Frankfurter was a member of its national committee until he went on the bench.
In his decision, Frankfurter hailed the stars and stripes as standing for “absolute safety for free institutions against foreign aggression.” Later on, he stated that the issue was whether schools should be barred “from determining; the appropriateness of various means to evoke that unifying sentiment without which there can ultimately be no liberties, civil or religious.”
Justice Stone wrote a memorable sentence in his dissent:
“History teaches us that there have been but few infringements of personal liberty by the State which have not been justified, as they are here, in the name of righteousness and public good, and few which have not been directed, as they are now, at helpless political minorities.”
Historical note in conclusion: Frankfurter was one of the twelve lawyers who signed a celebrated attack against the Palmer “red raids” of 1920; one of the prosecuting attorneys working for Palmer in those raids was named Owen J. Roberts. Last week, Frankfurter, and Roberts, sitting side by side on the Supreme Court bench, voted side by side to compel school children to salute the flag.
 



Several weeks ago, Archibald MacLeish, recently appointed Librarian of Congress, spoke before the American Association for Adult Education. His speech, which marked a new low in the confusion and cowardice the war crisis is generating among the liberal intelligentsia, was widely – and favorably – commented on in the press. Its main theme was picked up and elaborated by Roosevelt a short time later in the Charlottesville speech. For MacLeish with his keen nose for what is “in the air”, in his speech singles out one of the most delicate problems now confronting the Roosevelt Administration: the notorious lack of enthusiasm of the young people of America either for the war preparations now on foot or for the social system these preparations are designed to defend.
 
Miseducating the Young
MacLeish charges that the young generation in America “seems unable to see that the issue before it ... is at bottom a moral issue, a spiritual issue – that in dealing with such issues, words must have meaning and moral judgments must have validity”. However, he finds that “the young generation is distrustful of all words and distrustful of all moral judgments of better and worse.” This he rightly sees as a great if not a fatal defect in any national defense plan. No use to build planes and battleships if those who must man them have lost faith in the cause they are fighting for.
And what is responsible for this state of affairs? Is it that the youth see that the last war for democracy was not a success? Is it that they find jobs harder and harder to get, that they see no decent living ahead for them, no useful place in society, no room for them in a capitalism suffocating under its own contradictions? Maybe they don’t think much of a society which expects them to get married on ten or twelve bucks a week?
No, none of these considerations seem to have occurred to MacLeish. (Those who continue to think on this vulgar economic plane in times like these are “Fifth Columnists”.) He places the blame squarely on the writers of the last twenty years, who have miseducated the youth by casting doubts on the rightness of the present order of society and, above all, by depicting the last war as not a glorious crusade but as a hideous bloody nightmare without and point or purpose.
In a word, those whoa are responsible for the present state of “moral disarmament” of American youth are not named Mellon, Hoover, Rockefeller, Ford, Morgan. They are named rather Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, Erich Maria Remarque, Stefan Zweig, Ignazio Silone.
MacLeish doesn’t have the guts to claim either (a) these anti-war novels are inferior to other leading novels of the age, or (b) that they tell lies about the last war. To say this would be too much – at present, at least – even for the general run of liberal intellectuals, and MacLeish is nothing if not cautious about sticking his neck out in such matters.
On the contrary, MacLeish explicitly states:
“These are the honest words of honest men, writers of great skill and integrity and devotion. They say what all of us after the war would have said if we, could ... But they are nevertheless words that have borne bitter and dangerous fruits.”
 
The Hemlock for Hemingway?
Reduced to its logical propositions, MacLeish’s speech boils down to: (1) the youth are not enthusiastic about fighting for the present American social system; (2) this is because they have been reading novels which expose the futility of the last war (3) this exposure was justified, the last war was futile, and furthermore these novels are great works of art; (4) nevertheless, it would have been better if they had never been written.
The important point is number 4. The Librarian of Congress, of the four or five most eminent American poets, here serves notice that it is better that the truth not be made public about such things. If the war crisis sharpens at the present rate, it is only a matter of time before MacLeish will be advocating, no doubt with tears in his eyes, censorship to prevent the birth of “dangerous” books and, for those already in existence, death by fire. Socrates was executed for “miseducating the youth of Athens”. When will Hemingway and Dos Passos be forced to drink the hemlock?
One of the many evidences of the really extraordinary vision of Franklin D. Roosevelt as an imperialist politician is this appointment of Archibald MacLeish to preside over the Library of Congress. Roosevelt was not alarmed by MacLeish’s “left” reputation. He knew a brother opportunist when he saw one, and he knew he could depend on MacLeish.
A friend recently wrote me, complaining of his failure to grasp, at the time it was made, the full significance of MacLeish’s appointment:
“How Time does expose my dullness! I should have proclaimed when Archie got the job: ‘Lo! FDR has picked the Heel who in the fullness of time will burn the books in the name of Culture.’ Only I suspect he is not a conscious Heel at all; just a clever wordsmith with lively survival instincts and crowd responses.”
On the basis of some acquaintance with MacLeish, I can say this characterization is a just one. MacLeish is the great opportunist of contemporary American letters. This makes his speech more rather than less significant. Weathervanes show which way the mind is flowing.
 



ONE of the chief bases for Marxism’s claim to superiority over other methods of interpreting history is that it can more accurately predict the future. And in the last decade, this claim has indeed received some impressive documentation. The collapse of the Popular Front in France and the New Deal in this country; the Hitler-Stalin pact; the explosion of the second world war; the crumbling of the bourgeois isolationist front in this country in the last month-these were all foreseen by Marxist analysis. But in the past year there have occurred turns of world history which we, as Marxists, did not foresee, notably the imperialist role played by the Soviet Union in the early months of the war, and – the question which is currently the most important for us – the tremendous military power of the German armies and, correspondingly, the unexpected military weakness of the Allies.
(Whether this means that Marxist doctrine itself requires some overhauling, or whether it simply shows a failure on the part of our movement to correctly apply Marxism – this important question cannot be gone into here. Personally I believe the latter to be the case.)
This miscalculation as to the course of the war has forced us to radically alter our agitational line in the past month, and may also indicate that our understanding of the social and economic nature of German fascism, and of the degree of its difference from the old-style imperialisms of England and France, that this understanding has been defective. Our perspective on the war up to a month ago assumed (1) a long drawn-out struggle which would leave both sides exhausted, (2) an ultimate Allied victory. (In other words, we, along with most bourgeois opinion, thought of this war as essentially a repetition of the last war.) Therefore, the main aim of our propaganda was to show that an Allied victory would not mean democracy, that the Allies were fighting for the same imperialist aims as the Nazis.
These propositions remain as true today as ever, but they are now somewhat beside the point. The new turn the war has taken poses two questions to us: (1) what modifications, if any, are necessary in our propaganda? (2) is the unexpected power of the Nazi offensive simply a military-technical question, or is it a reflection of a much greater qualitative difference between the Nazi socio-economic system and the Anglo-French system than we have up to now recognized?
These questions seem to me to be the most important problems now facing our movement. Elsewhere in this issue there is an article by E. Erber discussing the first. In following issues, I plan to attempt some consideration of the second question, based on data now being gathered. This month I propose to turn over this department to a manuscript dealing with these themes, which has recently come into my hands. As will be seen, it is written as informal notes or memoranda. The author prefers to remain anonymous. I have added a few comments of my own at the end.
The paper takes up the general nature of the war and raises the interesting question of totalitarianism-from-above as against totalitarianism-from-below:
 
1.
Up to now, Marxist propaganda has been based on the assumption that Germany will be defeated in this war. Its gist, in proletarian English, is: what good is victory with the prospect of another and greater war twenty years from now?
From this assumption of Allied victory stems the hopeless floundering of the revolutionary movement since the beginning of the war, its inability not only to make itself felt, but to grow at all.
The Marxists pointed out that only a totalitarian nation could fight a total war. Totalitarianism is masses plus machines, not machines alone. What conclusions were drawn from this observation? Only the conclusions of ABC. But it was not at all considered that totalitarian-ism by legal decree, which is in substance the wartime totalitarianism of the Allies, is not the terrible monolithism that wins wars. It more closely resembles the adaptation of classic South American government.
From the Marxist premises, the only possible conclusion is that Germany must win the war. For if, only totalitarianism can win the war, and if M-Day is not the right brand, being totalitarianism by decree and not from below, then Germany must win. Yet in our activity we have failed to draw that conclusion.
To induce from the imperialist necessity of totalitarianism that the Allies will establish fascism on the pattern of the Industrial Mobilization Bill is only possible if revolutionary thought has become corrupted by two muddy streams: “third period” Stalinism with its inability to distinguish between fascism and militarism, and “official” thought in this country, which cannot see its own demise.
 
2.
It is wrong to call M-Day a blueprint for fascism. Fascism is a movement from below, utilized not even by individual capitalists necessarily, but by institutionalized capitalism as a whole. Fascism in America will not come by administrative repression. It will come when the war-torn soldiers and civil populace overturn the executives of the “Jewish War”. Watch the Christian Front; the psychology of its members suggests that when America participates, they will go along. Their mental reservations will be far different from those of Norman Thomas or Jack Altman. A program of Jingoism coupled with demands for the ousting of Jews from the control of the Jingo machine, exposes of “Jewish treason” in the conduct of the war – the coincidence of Jewish treason in the conduct of a Jewish war is no more difficult to reconcile than that of the harmony of (Jewish) Bolshevism and (Jewish) finance-capital worked out by Spengler – will prepare for the timed opposition by which the Coughlin mob will either try to effect a revolution during the war or after it.
 
3.
If the basis of the tremendous German victories so far were really nothing more than the military superiority of Germany, Man’s Hope would become the outstanding political document of our epoch, and revolutionists should “fight rather to keep something alive than in the hope that anything will triumph”. For military inferiority would be just as real for a Red France as for a Black France.
The Allies cannot win because their peoples have nothing to fight for. It is the unofficial stalling of the buck privates which determines defeat. There are ideas by which even the lowly masses live, and democracy was once one of them. The democratic and imperial ideas have crumbled, and the birth rate is falling. And the birth-rate is important. It means not only that capitalism has reached an economic impasse, where children become a luxury. The rich have less children than the poor. It means that the process of the dissolution of faith in the validity of life which dominated the English world of letters in the last century has reached its hedonistic conclusion in this century. For the wealthy, it is too much pain to bear children; it complicates divorces; etc.
Only the totalitarian nations have been able to arrest the fall of the birth-rate by state subsidies. But the subsidy is enforced by the idea: the evening of imperialism is shining on the Stonehenge-estates.
It does not matter whether the German masses have anything to fight for; it is important that they think they have. German economy by its policy of dynamic aggression is able to postpone its collapse; the mass depends on the velocity. Military defeat can make a revolutionary Germany again, but not from the incredible Allies.
Can the entrance of America turn the tide? Are the American people all used up, or ready for imperialist resurgence? The United States is Carthage to Hitler’s Rome just as England is Rome to Hitler’s Attila.
The American masses are duped as to the nature of the war much more easily than they were in 1917, but they will fight much less efficiently when they are sent. The majority of the working class right now believe that American participation in the world slaughter would be beneficient to the national interest but probably mortal to their own interest; and they are afraid.
 
4.
To transform fear into revolutionary heroism is not easy. It is necessary for revolutionists to confront the people with their own fear. It is time to analyze the war from the standpoint of inevitable German victory, even with American entry, and trace the basis of that victory in the national paralysis of the status-quo powers. We must, above all, expose the economic roots of this paralysis, this death-wish. In-stead of beginning from proofs that Allied victory will settle nothing, we must begin with what is for the masses the almost experiential certainty of German victory and prove that only a revolutionary army can defeat Hitler.

The most valuable point made above, it seems to me is the distinction between Anglo-French-American totalitarianism by administrative decree “from above”, and the more organic and monolithic German variety “from below”. We have understood clearly enough that fascism could not be built in this country from the top down, that the great corporations and banking interests could not charm into being a native fascism by any amount of money and force. As Guerin puts it: “Fascism is not born solely from the desires and subsidies of big business.” But, while rejecting the Stalinist equation of Hooverism with fascism, we have not been keenly enough aware that, by the same token, the Administration’s M-Day and industrial mobilization plans cannot properly be called “fascist”. The war has not strengthened native fascist movements; on the contrary, they are now in the “fifth column” category. The new American totalitarianism now being worked out jointly by finance capital and the New Deal in Washington is not fascist because its basic ideology is the old bourgeois-democratic stuff that has already proved its historical bankruptcy in England and France. This fact makes the greatest difference to both bourgeois and revolutionary strategies in this next period over here.
But my correspondent overstresses his valid point when he writes, “It does not matter whether the German masses have anything to fight for; it is important that they think they have.” The great weakness in Hitler’s position is precisely that it does matter to the German masses whether they have something real to fight for, and that a German victory will by no means give solid, material answers to this question of war aims. The Allies are facing their supreme crisis now. Hitler will face his after he wins the war.
In the same way, my correspondent overstresses the factor of morale in this war – “the unofficial stalling of the buck privates.” It is true that the German troops seem to have high morale, and, even more significant, that the new German military tactics (parachute troops, wholesale use of tanks and planes) depend much more on the initiative and courage of the individual soldier than do the defensive tactics of the Allies. But it is also true, if the newspapers are to be believed, that the remarkable feat of evacuating most of the BEF from Dunkirk was possible only because of high morale among the Allied troops. Not morale but equipment seems to be the decisive factor in this war.
Finally, I don’t believe that most American workers believe entry into the war would be good for America’s national interests but fatal to their own class interests. I don’t think they make any such distinction. The American working class will have to become very much more class conscious than it is now before it understands that its class interests can conflict with the national interest as well as coincide with it.

Fortune Magazine Analyzes the War Economy of the Allies and Comes to the Conclusion that American Capitalism Can’t Win a Totalitarian War without Going Totalitarian Itself



How did it happen? And what must American capitalism do to prevent its happening again in a few years over here?
These are the question Fortune, the dollar-a-copy house organ of American big business, answers in an authoritative and enormously interesting article in its current issue.
Fortune surveys in great detail the war economy created by the democracies and comes to some conclusions as to this country which are not ordinarily put down in public print. But in talking to a dollar-a-copy audience, the editors of Fortune no doubt felt they could be realistic and frank.
 
Bankrupt Empires
The most remarkable discovery of Fortune’s editors is that the British and French empires no longer pay their own way. They are living off accumulated capital like a couple of elderly ladies who have to go into their savings a bit each year to keep going. Or as Fortune puts it, after presenting a detailed analysis of the empires’ balances of international payments for the prosperous year 1937:
“On the merchandise side of the international ledger, they import so much more than they export that the huge income from their services – interest and dividends from their $26 billion worth of foreign investments, their shipping, from tourist spending within their borders, from banking commissions accruing to London and Paris as financial capitals – can’t make up the difference.”
France and her empire ended up the year $164,000,000 in the red. The only part of the British Empire that produced more than it received was Canada, and it was only the huge gold production of South Africa and Canada ($675,000,000 in 1937) that enabled the Empire to bring its books into a rough balance at the end of the year.
 
Why the Allies Lost
But this economic failure of the two empires was a long-range factor, not an immediately dangerous weakness. They could have won the war in spite of it. And every one expected them, to do so. Fortune shows that the democracies went into the war with adequate supplies within their own empires of every one of a list of twenty strategic raw materials except one, namely, oil, which they had no trouble getting on the world market. Germany had sizeable amounts of only five – steel, coal, sugar, zinc, and potash. The democracies, furthermore, had a combined war chest, in gold reserves and foreign investments, of no less than $37 billion as against a Germany stripped by the effort of rearmament of almost all her gold and liquid reserves, and blockaded from most of the world market by the British fleet.
Why, then, did the Allies fail? Fortune answers quite frankly: because they did not have totalitarian regimes which kept down wages, smashed unions, organized national production without paying too much attention to private property interests, and generally converted the nation into a barrack camp. The Nazis built this sort of a war machine, and won the war.
 
The Choice for U.S. Capitalism
From its study of the Allied experience. Fortune concludes that the only way a capitalist America – and no other kind of America is, of course, considered by the editors of Fortune – can win its coming struggle against Nazi imperialism will be to become the same sort of totalitarian society as exists in Germany. Fortune’s conclusions may be summarized in four propositions:


War is no longer an accident, an episode, but an integral part of the existing world order (“It is of the nature of democracies to regard war as something apart ... The fact is that, irrespective of the direction of democratic institutions, war is a recurring phase of the democratic existence.”)
 
The kind of Wehrwirtschaft (“war economy”) the Nazis have created is something quite different from the sort of emergency wartime dictatorships (M-Day plans, etc.) put into effect by the democracies. (“Thus France went to war under what are generally described as totalitarian controls ... And yet the state did not really take charge. It simply established its civil servants and military officers inside the normal economy, which was still run by much the same masters.”)
 
This Wehrwirtschaft is a totalitarian proposition, ruling the whole national economy (business as well as labor) in the interest of war preparations and in that interest alone. (“In a war economy, the government makes the decisions. It commands a man’s soul and his labor and it rations his bread. The government fixes wages and prices and profits ... And through its leverage on the national income, it can squeeze the economy into any shape it desires. Thus a nation’s productive capacity is shifted from consumption to war goods.”)
 
And finally, lest there be any illusions as to the nature of this sort of “war economy” which Fortune sees as the only possible way for American capitalism to withstand Hitler, there is this warning: “Our statesmen are deceiving themselves and they are deceiving us when, with phrases cut to the ballot box, they say that a nation can be made ready to fight an efficient war without touching hard-bought social gains.”


That is, the editors of Fortune politely call President Roosevelt a liar.
 







If you want to see what a REAL “fifth columnist” looks like, here’s the story of the chairman of the Texas Oil Corporation and his business deals with Franco and Hitler



There was an odd little news item buried in the back pages of the N.Y. Times the other day. Quoting recent statistics on American oil exports, the article slated that “diplomatic circles in Washington” fear that “there is every reason to believe that far more oil has been reaching Germany from America since the war started than Herr Hitler has obtained, or can hope to obtain, from Russia.” This oil has reached Germany first through Italy and then, since Italy entered the war, through Spain, whose current imports of American crude oil and gasoline are “far in excess” of last year’s figures. Already Franco has accumulated a reserve stock of almost 6,000,000 barrels and American tankers (under foreign registry to get around the Neutrality Act) bring in more every week. Thus the American business community is preparing to save democracy from the foul monster of fascism
 
Enter “Cap” Rieber
“Diplomatic sources assert,” continued the item, “that the Texas Oil Corporation, of which Torkild Rieber is chairman of the board, has a contract to supply the Spanish oil monopoly with most of its gasoline and crude oil. This contract is said to permit the Franco government to call for almost unlimited oil supplies.”
Torkild Rieber is no free-lance adventurer who chanced to strike a good bargain with Franco. He is executive head of one of the biggest oil companies in the country, and his dealings with Franco – and Hitler – form merely one strand of the complex web of business interests which ties Wall Street to the Rome-Berlin axis. According to a recent profile in Life, Rieber is a lusty, high-powered sort of fellow, who worked his way up from captain of a Texaco tanker to the chairman’s desk. Life is no end impressed by “Cap” Rieber, as it affectionately calls him, venturing to suggest he is nothing less than “the greatest oil man alive.” It chronicles in detail his brilliant exploits, which include opening up the great Barco oil concession in the depths of the Colombian jungle (Life says nothing of the skullduggery the U.S. State Department had to resort to before “Cap” Rieber got the concession safely put away), and a big deal which gave Texaco a large interest in the rich Bahrein oil field at the entrance to the Red Sea.
 
Oil for the Lamps of Franco
Life ends its profile on a fine patriotic note:
“The American industrial machine is the one force left in the world that can stand up to the German war machine, but to do so it must have the aggressive kind of industrial leadership. The nation needs able, hardboiled daring business leaders – in short, Riebers.”
Granted his ability and toughness, “Cap” Rieber doesn’t seem to fit the role of a democratic Galahad. To date, he has been a member of the other team. Life tells the story of another big Rieber deal:
“When the Spanish civil war broke out, in July, 1936, Texaco had five tankers on the high seas bound for Spain. Rieber was in Paris. He flew to Spain, took a good look around and forthwith ordered his tankers to deliver their oil to the insurgents ... For the next two years, Texaco supplied Franco with all the oil he needed, while the Loyalists never had enough. If Franco had lost, Texaco would have been out some $6,000,000. But the gamble won and not only did victorious Franco pay his bill but the Spanish monopoly is currently buying all its oil from Texaco.”
 
It’s a Small World, Herr Hitler
“In the light of subsequent events,” says Life hopefully, Rieber now regrets his decision to back Franco. If so, he is concealing the fact very successfully. As we have just seen, Texaco sells more oil than ever to Franco – and through Franco, to Hitler. Rieber’s relations with Berlin are extremely cordial. After the war began last fall, he visited both Rome and Berlin. His influence with the Nazis is strong enough to get all sorts of special favors for his company. He pays these back. Last April there arrived in this country a certain Dr. Gerhardt Westrick, whose official title is Commercial Counsellor to the German Embassy, and whose unofficial title is “Hitler’s ambassador-off-the-record to U.S. businessmen.”. Dr. Westrick is trying to interest American businessmen in friendly cooperation with Nazi Germany after the war. And one of his best “contacts” over here is Torkild Rieber of Texaco. It’s a small world! So small, in fact, is this world of big business that it includes even the upstanding patriots who (at a mere $1 a year, plus whatever else they can lay their hands on) are running the national defense program for our idealistic President Roosevelt. And so we find the following curious chain of relationships.


On July 10, 1940, the Texas Corporation offered to the investing public $60,000,000 of 3% debentures.
 
The banking house which is floating this security issue is the powerful Wall Street firm of Dillon, Read & Co.
 
The president of Dillon, Read & Co. is James Forrestal.
 
Mr. Forrestal is now on leave of absence in Washington, where he is functioning as special executive assistant to that great champion of democracy against the Nazi hordes, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.


A small world? It’s positively microscopic!
 



The editors of Time have performed a real public service by giving, in the last two issues of that magazine, a partial listing to date of the business executives who have been put in charge of the national defense program fat a dollar a year each) by President Roosevelt. The partial list is as follows:

Big Business Closes Ranks to Face Its German Rivals
As the Democratic convention settles down to the arduous task of “drafting” Roosevelt, it may be worth while to review briefly what has been happening in national politics in the last two months. The blitzkrieg hasd already cracked our democratic system as wide open as the Maginot Line. Since the Reichswehr crossed the Dutch border on May 10, this country has travelled farther and faster towards black reaction than in any similar period in its history.
To understand what has happened, we must go back to three events in 1937 which marked the turning point of the “New Deal” era. Now the New Deal era was no time of milk-and-honey for the American people. It is true that unquestionable social gains were made then, but compared to the needs of a nation with ten to fifteen million permanently unemployed, these were pitifully inadequate. Nor could it ever be said that Franklin Roosevelt was at any time a very bold or consistent fighter against the big boys in Wall Street. He lined up quietly enough on major issues, practically handing the country over to business in the NRA period. Nonetheless one can speak of a “turning point” in his policies in the sense that at one time they were, however timid and inadequate, better than they are now. The first of the events in 1937 which marked the end of the New Deal was the serious political defeat suffered by the Administration forces in the Supreme Court fight. The issue itself was not important – Roosevelt later got the “liberalized” Court he wanted in another way – but the defeat itself was: it meant the beginning of the political retreat of the New Deal. That summer the wave of working-class upsurge which had created the CIO was smashed against the granite resistance of big business in the disastrous Little Steel strike. Finally, the economic dead-end which the New Deal spending policies had reached was dramatically shown in the sudden and severe business collapse which took place in the fall of 1937.
 
Birth of the ‘War Deal’
Roosevelt realized the game was up. Within a few weeks of the stock-market collapse, he announced a sharp turn away from domestic reform towards a full imperialistic war policy. That was in the famous Quarantine the Aggressor speech he delivered in Chicago. Since then, every advance by Hitler abroad has caused a corresponding retreat from the “New Deal” by Roosevelt.
Step by step, the American business community has drawn closer to That Man in the White House, realizing that this once hated and feared demagogue has long had a profounder understanding of their own imperialist interests than they themselves. As men of business, also, they could see that democracy is like any other commodity: the more there is for export, the less remains for domestic consumption. And so the line of demarcation between Wall ‘Street and Washington has grown steadily fainter.
 
Enter the One Party System
The blitzkrieg erased it completely. A year or two ago people were talking hopefully about a third party. Today there are no longer even two parties. The Republican and the Democratic parties have merged into a monolithic front of American capitalism.
To run his war machine, Roosevelt has called into his cabinet the conservative Republicans, Knox and Stimson, to whom he has handed over the Navy and the War departments. And the direction of the ten billion dollar rearming program has been taken out of the hands of the New Dealers and given over to several dozen bankers and corporation executives headed by Stettinius of U.S. Steel and Knudsen of General Motors.
The Republicans, on the other hand, have had to abandon the “isolationist” line with which they tried to make political capital out of the anti-war sentiment of the masses. Now that the Nazi threat to American imperialist interests has become serious, the Republicans have been forced, as the climax to the most confused and “wide open” national convention in party history, to give the nomination to a candidate whose views on foreign policy are indistinguishable from Roosevelt’s.
The Republicans have Democratized their foreign policy, the Democrats have Republicanized their domestic policy, and both parties have joined forces to prepare national defense under the banner of reaction. No party lines have been drawn in Congress on such measures as the anti-alien laws, the relaxing of war profit curbs, the grandiose plans of the State Department to “coordinate” North and South America into an economic grossraumwirtschaft (“large-scale super-national economy”) ruled from Washington, the “Fifth Column” attack on Reds and unions, the powerful drive against the Wagner Act and the wages and hours laws, and various plans for peace-time conscription of adults and for putting the youth into government labor camps.
 
Reynaud Is the Name, Not Blum
A great deal of nonsense is now being written by the liberals about the necessity for a democratic defense program. the only possibility of a democratic defense, as Labor Action has often pointed out, is through a workers’ socialist government. But the liberals continue to hope.
“If the United States is to resist a triumphant Germany,” writes George Soule in The New Republic, “we can fortify ourselves only by fulfilling and invigorating our democracy.”
And Roosevelt keeps repeating that not a hair of the New Deal social program – which is pretty bald by now, anyway – must be touched.
An equal amount of nonsense is talked by Willkie and the conservative press, who blame the whole failure of the Allies on the Popular Front government in France – as though first Daladier and then Reynaud did not have two years of right-wing government in which to prepare against Hitler! Willkie hammers away at “the Blum government in Washington”.
But it is all a sham battle. Everybody, except of course the liberals, knows quite well that a “democratic” defense of democracy is a luxury American capitalism cannot afford in its present bankrupt state. Whichever wins the election, Tweedledum Willkie or Tweedledee Roosevelt, the defense program will continue to be organized along the same Wall Street lines it now has.
This will be a fight against Hitlerism in the Reynaud tradition. And after Reynaud comes Petain and Dictatorship.
 







Editor’s Note: This is the first of a series of articles on the development of class struggle in wartime England. Later articles will be:
2. Focal Points of Class Conflict: Taxes, Wages, Profits, Civil Liberties, etc.
3. London Under Siege: Social and Political Tendencies.
4. Arming the Peoples; the Home Guard Movement.
5. The British War Economy.
6. Whither England?





Since last May, England’s war effort has been run by a contradictory and explosive combination of Tory and Labor politicians. Symbolic of this peculiar union of ultimately irreconcilable tendencies are the two most powerful war leaders: Bevin, who organized strikes to stop the shipment of munitions for intervention against Bolshevik Russia in 1920 and who led the British general strike of 1926 (and helped betray it): and Churchill, who was the driving force of both the Allied intervention against the Bolsheviks and the smashing of the 1926 general strike. This political union is the expression of the deeply conflicting class forces set in motion by the war. The British masses want the war to be conducted efficiently and democratically, for socialist war aims. Symptoms of this are the fight for civil liberties, the struggle in London over the issue of deep air-raid shelters for the East End masses, the popular pressure for arming the people (in a later article I shall take up a remarkable expression of this – T.H. Wintringham’s New Ways of War, available over here in a 25 cent Penguin edition), and above all, in the “revolutionary” demagogy which leaders like Bevin and Laski find it expedient to use in discussing the question of war aims. On the other hand, the Tory oligarchy conducting the imperialist war, led first by Chamberlain and now by Churchill, has opposed these demands as far as it has dared and has insisted both on keeping the conduct of the war as much as p0ossible in the hands of Conservative politicians and on avoiding any commitments as to general war aims.
This is an explosive situation, full of revolutionary possibilities. So far, these conflicts of interest and policy have been successfully controlled by joint action of the Tories, who have shown all the well-known skill of the British ruling class in making just enough concessions to avoid a showdown, and of the Labor Party bureaucracy, who have shown the equally celebrated willingness of reformist leasers to compromise, “cooperate”, and, at all costs, avoid taking power by a new election. But how long can this situation last? Never before has a great industrial nation been subjected to the kind of total warfare the German air force is now dealing out to England. The British social structure, most rigid and stratified in the modern world, is being shaken by the bombs of the luftwaffe (air war). For the first time since the 1926 Genera! Strike, the British masses are stirring, deeply questioning the policies and competence of the oligarchy and putting increasing pressure on their own reformist leadership.
What can we expect in England in the next few months? In this series I shall try to answer this question by analyzing the background of the first year of the war. Let us begin with the role of the British Labor Party.
 
Who Is Using Whom?
“The British labor movement.” said Bevin last month, “came to the rescue of this nation and the Commonwealth at the blackest hour of its history.” This is incontrovertibly true. But the question is: who is making use of whom? The German Social Democracy also “came to the rescue of the nation” (that is, of the ruling class) at a black hour, but few would now deny that it was the big bourgeoisie who used the Social Democracy and not vice versa. Today the liberals of the Nation and renegade leftists like Sidney Hook argue that it is Labor which is using the Tories, that the effect of the Labor Party’s participation in Churchill’s war cabinet is to prepare the war for socialism and even – so bold are these gentry in words! – revolution.
In my opinion, however, we already have enough evidence to state quite definitely that, while there are great revolutionary potentialities in the British situation today, they are being strangled and not furthered by the war policies of the Labor Party. The leaders of the Labor Party have been pushed into whatever advances they have made by irresistible pressure from their own rank-and-file; they have taken such actions reluctantly, timidly, hesitantly; they have allowed the Tories to hold the key political positions; and they have not only made no advances since May but have even been pushed back a little. The impossibility of fighting for workingclass aims through a capitalist-imperialist-laborite coalition government has been once more amply documented.
 
“Chamberlain Must Go!”
Throughout the “quiet period” of the war last year, the British masses showed a steadily increasing dissatisfaction with the incompetent Chamberlain government. At the beginning of the war, the Labor Party had made a “political truce” with the Conservatives, whereby the latter would be allowed to run the government without any effort by the Labor Party to overthrow them. The huge parliamentary majority which the Conservatives had piled up in the last general election four years ago was to be left undisturbed; the Labor Party would make no effort to get a new general election. There was great, popular opposition to this policy: more resolutions by trade unions opposing the “truce” policy were passed in the months immediately before the Labor Party’s May conference at Bournemouth than had ever before been brought forward against any policy of the Labor Party’s executive. The Norwegian fiasco (and not the Labor Party’s executive! sealed the doom of the Chamberlain government. On May 8 the Labor Party finally decided to break the truce and forced a vote of confidence in Parliament. Although Chamberlain won, his majority was cut from 210 to 81, and it was clear he would have to resign.
 
Churchill’s New Deal
On May 10, as the German Army poured into the low countries, Chamberlain resigned. Churchill took over, and the Labor Party executive, meeting in Bournemouth, unanimously voted to enter the new government. The War Council which Churchill created was made up of three Conservatives (Churchill, Chamberlain, Halifax) and two Laborites (Atlee and Greenwood). Laborites also went into important cabinet posts: A.V. Alexander, Ramsey Macdonald’s First Lord of the Admiralty, took over his old post again; Herbert Morrison, president of the London City Council, became Minister of Supply, in charge of Britain’s industrial mobilization; Ernest Bevin, top leader of the trade unions, became Minister of Labor; Hugh Dalton, Labor’s outstanding economist became Minister of Economic Warfare, in control of foreign trade and the blockade.
Morrison, Bevin and Dalton, generally considered the most energetic and able top leaders of the British labor movement, thus were put in control of the key economic ministries. Atlee and Greenwood seem to be mediocrities, as ineffectual as their Tory colleagues on the War Council.) The hopes of the Labor Party were pinned on these three men. “The Party will lose its nerve completely if they fail,” wrote one liberal journalist.
At one job, at least, the Labor chieftains were determined not to fail: at regimenting the British masses for the war. On May 22 Parliament passed the Emergency Powers Defence Bill, introduced by Atlee, on behalf of the War Council, which provided for nationalizing of all munitions plants, 100% excess profit tax, government control of all industry, and, most sweeping of all, vesting in the Minister of Labor authority “to direct any person to perform any service required” and “to prescribe terms of remuneration, hours of labor, and conditions of work.” Laborite Morrison at once put all war industries on twelve-hour shifts, while Laborite Bevin soon issued an order prohibiting strikes and instituting compulsory arbitration. In a few weeks the historic gains of British Labor won in a century of class struggle, were wiped out. No one could say that the Labor Party was not “cooperating” loyally. What did it get in return?
One thing it did not get was the removal of Chamberlain and the Chamberlain influence from the government. All through the summer the same pattern was repeated as during the preceding winter: increasing popular pressure to get rid of Chamberlain and his crowd, resistance by Tories in control, timidity and evasiveness by the Labor Party leaders. And once more it was not any initiative on the part of the “leaders” of the working class, but simply the brute onslaught of events, which forced a change. After the British Army’s annihilation on the continent and the terrific German air attack on London in September had once more exposed the sabotage and incompetence of the Chamberlain system, Churchill was forced to reshuffle his cabinet.
 
Two Steps Backward, One Ahead
The Labor leaders scored two successes in the changes made in the government in October: Chamberlain resigned, pleading ill health (he died some weeks later), and Bevin look his place in the War Council. But Churchill more than made up for this concession by adding to the Council Chamberlain’s colleagues, Sir John Anderson and Sir Kingsley Wood. The N.Y. Times described them as “two of the most criticised men in Britain.” Anderson, as
Minister of Home Security, was responsible for the lack of deep shelters. Wood had failed badly both as Air Secretary and as Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the new War Council, the Conservatives had an even greater majority than in the old one. Instead of 3 to 2, it was now 5 Conservatives (Churchill, Beaverbrook, Halifax, Wood, Anderson) to 3 Laborites (Atlee, Greenwood, Bevin). Furthermore, Morrison was removed from the key post of Minister of Supply, apparently on the grounds that he didn’t “get on” with the manufacturers, and the post went to the steel magnate, Sir Andrew Rae Duncan. Thus the Churchill-Laborite government has moved to the right, not to the left. There is a great deal of talk in liberal circles over here about England’s “wartime democracy”. It is true that civil liberties have been preserved to a remarkable extent and that labor has even won certain social gains. But these have been concessions forced, as I shall show next week, from an insecure ruling class by working class action. Nor are they decisive factors. On the main issue, namely the capitalist class character of the government and the imperialist aims of the war the Tories of course have yielded nothing. The very fact that the Conservative Party should still control the government is a denial of democracy, since they hold their power on the basis of a Parliamentary majority which they got in 1935 and which they would almost certainly not get if elections were held today. But no general election will be held in England if the Labor Party leadership can prevent it. For then they might come face to face with the nightmare that haunts all reformist politicians; they might have to take power.
 



Before this war began, we all read lurid prophecies in the Sunday supplements about the terrific devastation and massacre air bombing would cause in big cities. These predictions have been borne out, but only in the case of cities with little or no anti-aircraft defenses: Barcelona, Warsaw, Rotterdam. The German air force has been bombing English cities for over three months now with the greatest intensity, and yet, according to official figures, during the months of September and October, in all England only 13,288 civilians were killed and 19,310 wounded. In Coventry, worst bombed of all English cities, there were only 422 “known” deaths. The effect of the German air attack on England has so far not been to cause that chaos, panic, and dramatic breakdown of society the Sunday papers expected. These effects are slower-working, less dramatic and sensational – but highly significant, for all that.
 
The Shelter Issue
In a city under bombardment week after week, class politics takes new and peculiar forms. The usual forms of class struggle tend to be suspended in an armistice by mutual agreement while every one concentrates on the main job: to defend life and limb from the common enemy in the sky. In London today strikes and municipal elections have become subordinate forms of class struggle. Thus the German air attack is a levelling, a “democratizing” force. However, in the course of this common struggle to survive and to beat back the enemy attack, the old class conflicts and injustices reappear in different forms. The great political issue in London today is the air-raid shelter question.
The Chamberlain government, during the “quiet” period of the war, dealt with the matter of shelters as it did with all other problems, with extreme ineffectiveness. Sir John Anderson, Minister of Home Security, adopted a policy of shallow, tin-roofed, individual backyard shelters. These “Anderson shelters” gave some some protection from flying bomb splinters and debris, but were uselesss against a direct hit or even a large bomb blast nearby. They were also too small to be slept in – and, since the raids last all night, shelters must be first of all dormitories.
When the raids began in earnest this fall, the masses of the East End – the great working class slum district which, being near the docks and factories, was bombed worst – took matters into their own hands and crowded into whatever deep holes in the ground they could find. The subway stations were the most obvious safe refuge. The London Transport System tried to forbid this mass invasion of its stations, but it was found to be impossible to enforce the prohibition. The people just forced their way in and spent the night.
But only a small proportion of the London masses could get into the subways. A tremendous popular demand arose for construction of large-scale “deep shelters”, where thousands of people could spend the night in safety. There were some demonstrations organized and led by Communists. A newspaper report reads:
“The group, from Stepney who crowded into the Savoy Hotel on the Strand last night and demanded shelter were obviously under Communist guidance. They delivered a prepared speech demanding the government provide deep bombproof shelters. They were allowed to stay in the hotel’s shelter until the all-clear sounded and then they were rushed out by the police.”
Such invasions of the big luxury hotels clearly have revolutionary implications – the very fact that a mob of people “from Stepney” should venture to set foot inside the Savoy is remarkable. So dangerous did the class tensions over the “shelter problem” become that Parliament held several secret sessions on it, apparently without coming to any conclusion.
 
The Labor Party Takes Over
When Churchill revised his cabinet this fall, he removed Hugh Morrison, with Bevin the outstanding Laborite leader, from the Supply Ministry and put him in Anderson’s place as Minister of Home Security. This was a really brilliant stroke of Tory politics, since it put a Laborite in a post where he would have to bear the brunt of rising popular indignation over the lack of shelters. Morrison at once proceeded to do his duty: his first public statement was an unqualified endorsement of the Anderson policies:
“There are people who are demanding deep shelters, I am bound to say, for mischievous political reasons, and sometimes doing it in ways which are almost fifth column in their effect. I am not always sure they are not fifth-column in intention.”
Later on he underlined his opposition to any effort to provide deep shelters, actually quoting Anderson’s famous formulation – “In practice, there is no 100% safely.” Here, as everywhere, the leaders of the Labor Party are forced by the very nature of their politics to put themselves in opposition to the deepest interests and desires of the masses they are “leading”. Morrison is sitting on a powder keg, as is indicated by the results of a recent
Gallup poll taken in England and printed in the New York Times for Nov. 30. This showed that of those interviewed, 66% “thought the government had been ill-advised in concentrating on surface shelters”, 19% had’ “no opinion”, while only 15% backed the Anderson-Morrison policy. Nor is the scarcity of deep shelters Morrison’s only headache. Conditions in the makeshift mass shelters are indescribable – no ventilation, a few buckets for all sanitary arrangements, no bunks or cots, people packed together so close as to touch each other. On the other hand:
“In the big hotels, there is plenty of comfort ... At the Savoy, soft mattresses have been installed. There is a maid in attendance from night until morning. There is a man who stands by just to turn snorers over on their sides. Warm drinks are served at bedtime and it is all very cosy.”
This glaring contrast between rich and poor shows that all are not “equal under the bomb”. Likewise, with the treatment people get who are bombed out of their houses.
“In the expensive West End district,” writes a correspondent, “people dug out of their shelters after a bombing are immediately taken oft in taxis to the hotels, given hot drinks and warm beds in an underground shelter. But some of these people in East London’s poor districts wandered about for 13 hours, having lost every possession in the world except what they stood up in, and were directed to a series of addresses which involved as much as eight miles of walking before they were cared for.”
The great question in England under bombardment is how long the Churchill-Labor government can keep control of the masses who see every day, in a more dramatic and direct way than is ever possible in peacetime, the grim realities of a modern class society.
 



The Department of Commerce has just released figures on last
year’s national income which we may expect Roosevelt to turn to
political advantage in his next fireside chat. According to the
Department’s calculations, in 1939 total individual incomes
came to $69,700,000,000, which is $3,400,000,000 higher than the 1938
total. Onward and upward with the New Deal!
But there is one detail the President won’t dwell on: the
fact that dividend payments last year were 15 per cent higher than in
1938, while the amount paid out for wages and salaries increased only
5 per cent.
This means that the capitalist system is more unbalanced than
ever, since wage-earners spend practically all their income, while
investors save up to as much as half their income. There is too much
surplus capital (the result of these savings) already piled up
seeking a profitable outlet for investment. What is necessary for the
system’s health is more markets, that is, more spending. The
dynamics of capitalism, however, make it inevitable that, as the
Structure of American Economy pointed out (p. 91): “As
income expands, both expenditure on consumption and current savings
can be expected to increase, but the increase in the latter will be
likely to be very much more rapid.” The prediction has been
borne out by the figures on 1939 income.
 

Behind the War Drive
This matter of “over-saving” is the theme of a letter
sent me recently from Akron:
“Your two columns on the report of the National
Resources Committee were quite favorably received here. I question
one statement you make in the January 6 issue. You write of the
polarizing tendencies of poverty and wealth, and say: ‘Economically,
this is ultimately fatal for a number of reasons, one of them being
that the masses spend almost all of their income on consumers’
goods (thus keeping the market humming) while the wealthy spend
comparatively little and pile up bigger savings (which can only be
used to build more factories, whose products must then still further
crowd the market)’”
On this my correspondent comments:
“After the initial
splurge of plant expansion following the war, the percentage of
savings which went into new plant dwindled and that portion which
went into non-productive speculation (and capital export) increased.
This trend, of course, has been exaggerated in the past ten years and
especially since 1937. The second war may offer the possibility of
profitable plant expansion, but this is doubtful. Certainly it will
not be in proportion to that of 25 years ago, and it will be confined
to semi-heavy and heavy industries.
“A growing, lusty capitalism goes through the
process you describe, but not a declining one. I think it would be
more correct to say that the enormous capital accumulation, rather
than having the domestic effect of increasing technological
unemployment primarily, instead is a mainspring in the war machine –
seeking new outlets in international spheres.”
I accept the emendation: American capital now presses for
investment outside rather than inside the boundaries of
the U.S. But I would add an emendation of my own: that there is a
third field into which capital has poured with great volume in
the last few years: investment in government debt. I have repeatedly
noted in this column the huge percentage of banking resources now
invested in government notes and bonds. This has implications both as
to the war drive and as to the advance of fascism in this country.
 




Letter from Canada
A friend sends in a letter he received from a friend in Winnipeg,
Manitoba:
“My Dear R...... As for your request for news of
how people here are taking the war, as yet that is beyond me. I can
only tell of one section, of a stroll I took late yesterday on Main
Street, along those few blocks north from the city hall to the
tracks.
“That was quite an unsavory district late Saturday
nights even when you lived here, as I guess you will recall. Last
night it really hummed. The worst yet.
”Hundreds of troops packed the sidewalks. Obviously
they had just drawn their first army pay. Indeed, for many of them it
must have been the first pay day in their hungry, thwarted, distorted
lives, and with pennies to jingle, ‘patriotism’ certainly
reached new mad, drunken heights. Boys became base, girls cheap. For
you know, dear R...... you can’t take thwarted kids straight
from prolonged chronic starvation, make them murderers above the
eyes, stuff their pockets with unfamiliar dollars,. and expect them
to be angels from the navel down ... Along the street, bulging
saloons slopped out Polsh-speaking ‘Scots’ in kilts.
Waiting prostitutes patriotically set bargain prices for the ejected
soaks ...
”A little mimeographed socialist anti-war sheet was
selling like hot cakes. I got a great kick when I spotted Lucille
B...... buying one – you remember her? Tom, her boy friend, may
yet have to go. It was an inspiriting sight – harmless little
Lucille red-facedly buying an illegal revolutionary sheet ...
“I crossed the street to the ‘politer’
side to buy some matches. The storekeeper, usually a jolly fellow,
appeared very downcast. He’d been watching the ‘doings’
across the way.
“‘Cold tonight, isn’t it? ... Fellow’s
just been in, said there’d been 20,000 recruits in Manitoba
already ... There’ll be millions killed again.’”
“I agreed, and, the War Acts being what they are,
merely added that in ancient Egypt the figure 1,000,000 was
represented by a picture of a man bent in bewilderment at the
enormity.
“‘But now it’s the million who are
bent,’ was the rejoinder. One thing might be added to this
account: it is estimated that 75 per cent of Canada’s
volunteers were unemployed.”
 

How Much Longer Will They Be Patient?
Last July and August, 775,000 men and women were dropped from
the WPA rolls. On January 25, Col. Harrington announced that of these
775,000, just 100,750 (or 13 per cent) had found jobs in private
industry by the end of last November. (And half of these lucky 13 per
cent were earning less in their private jobs than they had received
on WPA.) Remember this figure, the next time you hear Roosevelt
getting off his line about private industry absorbing those dropped
from WPA. That is a lie, and Roosevelt knows it.
What became of the 87 per cent who did not find jobs? According
to Col. Harrington, 28 per cent of them got onto local relief rolls
(where a family of four lives on from $4.50 to $34 a month), 27 per
cent were taken back onto WPA, “and 32 per cent were without
support of any kind except what they could procure through Federal
surplus commodities, by the sale of their effects, by doubling up
with relatives, or by begging.”
The Colonel also pointed out that before the end of June he
must drop 700,000 more men and women from the WPA rolls. “Does
your report point to a reduced WPA appropriation for next year?”
he was asked. “Hardly,” answered the Colonel. But his
boss in the White House has already indicated he means to slash WPA
next year, just as he did this year.
How much longer are. the unemployed going to take it in silence
and submission? A few really militant mass demonstrations, the sort
of thing that scared the bosses and their political stooges in 1931
and 1932, that’s what is needed to show Franklin D. he can’t
get away with it. The White House lawn can be used for other things
besides Easter egg rolling!
 




Magistrates and Labor Laws
Among the states, New York is especially noted for
its progressive labor legislation. In 1886 the first law regulating
hours of work of New York women employees was passed. In the
fifty-three years since then, largely because of the pressure of the
workers themselves, a structure of labor laws has been slowly built
up – laws limiting the hours of work of women and minors, laws
providing for sanitary inspections of factories, laws providing for
medical care and insurance benefits, at the boss’s expense, in
case of industrial disease and accidents.
The laws are fine – as far as they go, at
least. But it appears that in New York City they are simply not
enforced. The Consumers League of New York has issued a report
entitled, The City Magistrates and the Labor Laws, which every
trade union and labor organization should study. This covers all
labor cases heard in the city’s Magistrates’ Courts over
a period of three and a half years (January, 1934 through June,
1937).
Two out of every three of the employers who were
brought into court charged with violation of the labor laws got off
without any punishment whatsoever. The fines imposed on the remaining
third averaged $18. “In economic terms,” the report
notes; “this means that the profits accruing to violating
employers were left virtually intact.”
Why did two-thirds of the employers get off without
even a fine? Was it because they were found not guilty by the
magistrate? No, most of them were found guilty as charged. But they
paid no fine because they were let off with suspended sentences. One
magistrate found guilty 46 employers in one session. He fined one of
these $20, two $10, three $5, and he let the remaining 40 off scot
free with suspended sentences.
These are the same magistrates whose high salaries
and political corruption have been a scandal for years, the same
dispensers of “justice” who daily hand out heavy fines
and jail sentences to strikers, pickets and left-wing demonstrators.
It is time the unions did something about the perversion of justice
in the city’s Magistrates’ Courts.
 

The First Step
As this is written, the War Deal’s campaign to
lend Federal funds to “poor little Finland” (what about
“poor little WPA”, now suffering aggression without any
Mannerheim Line to fall back on ?) seems to be on the verge of
success in Congress. The liberal-isolationist bloc is meeting this
first real test by – joining the energy and whooping it up for
war loans to Finland.
What is behind Roosevelt’s
Poor-Little-Finland line is bluntly expressed in the Kiplinger
Washington News Letter for January 27:
“Pressure for credits to Allies is
increasing. Congress is sour on such credits now, but many
sophisticated Congressmen privately admit that the move to expand
Export-Import Bank and lend to Finland is a step towards some sort of
financial aid to the Allies at some later period.”
Poor Little Finland today means Poor Little
British Empire tomorrow.
 



“Is there anything we can do to help?” Roosevelt cabled each of his ambassadors during the Munich crisis. The answers could all be summed up: “Not without making some commitment.” But, as the authors of this book [1] sadly comment: “In view of American public opinion, a commitment was quite impossible.”
In spite of themselves. Alsop and Kintner have written a valuable book. They do their best to whitewash Roosevelt’s foreign policy. But. as exceptionally well-informed newspaper men, they can’t help constantly spotlighting the clash between Roosevelt’s warmongering and the deep anti-war sentiments of the American masses. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear what a powerful brake on Roosevelt’s war policies “public opinion” has been. How Roosevelt’s mouth watered at the prospect of throwing American weight into the scales and dominating the world! “But while he had the power.” note the authors. “our people continued to lack the will. Clear though our interests seemed, the President dared not assert our influence, utter a threat or offer a commitment, for fear of the political consequences.”
 
Reveals FDR War Moves
American White Paper is less exciting than its title suggests. There is not a great deal of important new material, considering the “pipe lines” Alsop and Kintner evidently have to the White House. But at least the story of Roosevelt’s steady march towards war is told here in some detail, and with many revealing flashes. To run over the main items:


The Munich crisis, when “positive and realistic policy-making became unavoidable” for Roosevelt. (His policy was so “positive” as to frighten Chamberlain and Daladier. In the first half year after Munich, the axis of the anti-Hitler front ran through Washington and not through Paris and London.)
 
The recall of U.S. Ambassador Wilson from Berlin after the November pogroms in Germany. (“In the State Department, a strong faction favored a mere written expression of disapproval to Hitler. They were overruled by the President.”)
 
The great French plane purchase scandal ... the “Our frontier is on the Rhine” statement ... the penalty duties placed on German imports (on the excuse of “dumping”) after Hitler took Czechoslovakia.
 
Roosevelt’s message to Hitler and Mussolini in April 1939 asking them to guarantee the integrity of a long list of countries, beginning with Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. (This message, in the light of later events, seems to have been sent to the wrong address.)
 
The backstage “chats” Hull and Roosevelt had with key senators trying to line up enough votes to jam through repeal of the Arms Embargo. (“Unfortunately, most of Hull’s pleading and the President’s reasoning might as well have been addressed to the empty air,” write the authors, meaning that Congressmen have to be much more sensitive to mass sentiment than presidents and State departments do.)
 
The secret conversations that summer between officials of the British and the American governments, arranging the details about the future purchase of munitions over here by the Allies. (“The English government, hoping for repeal of the arms embargo, had sent Lord Riverdale over to study purchasing methods with the Treasury’s procurement division during the summer” This “hope” of His Majesty’s Government was later realized, with the help of the White House.)


Once war actually broke out, the tempo of the war drive speeded up. A series of war preparations were made with feverish haste:


Roosevelt issued the decree of “limited national emergency,” which gave him dictatorial powers when and if he chose to use them.
 
He set the G-men to tracking down enemy spies and aliens, with special attention to “reds.”
 
He held up the sailing of the Bremen with the vain hope that the British fleet would be able to catch her outside New York.
 
He announced his famous 300-mile “safety zone” around North and South America, within which no belligerent submarine or warship could operate. (Originally, it was to be 100 miles wide but “the President redrew the map with the help of a ruler on his desk, widening the zone to an average of 300 miles and straightening its boundary.” As easy as that! But the British didn’t like the idea, and Roosevelt tactfully let it become a dead letter.)
 


Hides Real Aims
He called the special session of Congress to repeal the Arms Embargo and opened it with a “curious message,” (“It was curious because It did not once refer to the real aim behind the repeal drive, to permit the democracies to use the United States as their arsenal.”)
All through the story, Roosevelt’s foreign policy has this same “curious” character. As a shrewd politician, he is only too keenly aware of the anti-war temper of public opinion. He is therefore continually squirming and wriggling and maneuvering to smuggle his pro-war policies across disguised as anti-war policies. Alsop and Kintner give the whole show away when they write that Roosevelt has never “dared ... to present the issues of American foreign policy squarely to the people ... The fact is that from the Munich crisis through the spring of 1939 American policy was ingenious rather than forthright.” It could hardly be put any more plainly than that.



FDR – Liar Or Ignoramus?
“When Roosevelt saw that one plan contemplated accumulation of reserves to equip a large expeditionary force for Europe, he put his foot down hard, declaring, ‘You can base your calculations on an army of 730,000 men, for whatever happens, we won’t send troops abroad. We need only think of defending this hemisphere’.”
                                        – An American White Paper, by J. Alsop and R. Kintner, p. 65
“The new U. S. Army is a standing expeditionary force, designed for prompt conscript expansion into an expeditionary army of 750,000 active troops, 250,000 reserves ... The general staff has planned an outfit ready to be packed up and sent anywhere. The last place the Army expects to fight is on the U.S. mainland.”
                                        – Time, April 15, 1940
“The railroads, working in conjunction with the U.S. Army, have made plans whereby large bodies of soldiers could be moved through the port of New York without congesting it in the event that an American expeditionary force should be sent abroad. This was revealed by accident during I.C.C hearings yesterday in Brooklyn.”
                                        – N.Y. Times, April 24, 1940

As the Bronx Congressional campaign draws to its close. Max Shachtman is still far in the lead so far as speech making is concerned. Although it would be rash to predict his election on that account, there is no question but that Shachtman has made himself more widely known in the Bronx than any of his rivals. He has probably addressed more street meetings than all the other candidates put together. Their lack of energy is understandable: after all the election is pretty much in the bag for Boss Flynn’s man, Buckley, and so why should sensible men waste their time and wear out their throats campaigning? Shachtman differs from them in that, regardless of his chances of getting elected, he has a vital political message to put across to as many people as possible. He is one of the few candidates in this national election, in the country as well as in the Bronx, who has something to say to the people.
*
The American Labor Party has finally gotten around to printing a campaign throwaway for Jack Altman, Their Bronx congressional candidate. Nothing elaborate, of course, like the copiously illustrated brochures they have put out for Roosevelt – just a tiny square bearing his name, picture, and a few highlights from his biography. This inspiring success story – “Up From Socialism” it should be called – begins by pointing out that the London grammar school Altman attended as a kid has been “since bombed by Hitler”, No doubt that Nazi fliers had instructions to destroy this historic site, lest it become a future shrine for the international working class.

Flash! S.L.P. Spurns Shachtman!
“Interested in principles, not in mice or cockroaches” says spokesman
The “Shachtman for Congress Committee” recently sent out letters to four left-wing parties inviting them to support Max Shachtman as the only revolutionary anti-war candidate running in the Twenty-Third Congressional District. None of these parties – the Socialist Workers Party, the Lovestone group, the Socialist Labor Party, and the Socialist Party – has as yet indicated that it will support Shachtman in the Bronx.
I print below, as a document of possible interest to students of political psycho-pathology, the reply received from the Socialist Labor Party. This remarkable document is typed on a colorful letterhead bearing photographs of the S.L.P. candididates for president and vice-president (of the United States), as well as the notation, in red ink, that 1940 marks the “Golden Jubilee” of the S.L.P., which is fifty years old this year. The full text of the reply follows:
October 24, 1940
Mr. Dwight Macdonald,
Publicity Director,
Shachtman For Congress Committee,
114 W. 14th Street,
New York, New York
Sir:
Received your letter of October 17 suggesting that the Socialist Labor Party “endorse and support” what you call your “revolutionary anti-war campaign.” Rubbish! An “Anti-war campaign” is not necessarily revolutionary, and yours definitely is not. As far as it is possible to judge an outfit such as yours (neither fish nor fowl nor good red herring) you are reactionary to the core. Whatever gave you the idea that the Socialist Labor Party, with its half-century record of Marxian Socialism, would be interested in your petty political, or would-be political, schemes? The Socialist Labor Party is interested in principles, not in mice or cockroaches.
Go patch up your quarrel with the one who logically represents your political quackery, Stalin. It may be interesting enough to watch swine rending swine, but it it neither inspiring nor edifying.
If you had possessed sufficient brains and common decency, you might have saved yourself a lot of troubles and headaches if in the past you had read S.L.P. literature. What you have discovered, or what you think you have discovered, anent Stalin and his gang, the S.L.P. foretold years ago.
There is only one revolutionary Marxist organization in the United States – the S.L.P. Revolutionists do not “support” reformers or phony “revolutionaries.” Go and fish for the kind of votes you desire where you are likely to find them – in the petty bourgeois lame duck-pond.



 


Sincerely yours,
For the Socialist Labor Party
Emil F. Teichert

No one can say that the Socialist Workers Party doesn’t hew to its political line, letting the chips fall where they may. And they fall in some very odd places sometimes. Thus the Cannon group refused to join the Workers Party picket line in front of the Soviet consulate protesting the murder of Trotsky. The reason? It might be interpreted as an attack on the Soviet Union! The current example of this kind of sectarian simple-mindedness is the decision of the S.W.P. to support, in the Bronx Congressional elections, the pro-war super-patriotic Jack Altman – whose war-mongering was so unabashed as to cause the Socialist Party to expel him recently – in preference to Max Shachtman, candidate of the Workers Party. The reason? Because the pro-war Altman is running on the American Labor Party ticket, whereas the anti-war Shachtman is the candidate of a “petty-bourgeois pacifist sect”.
Does this sound unbelievable? I quote from an editorial in the October 26 issue of Socialist Appeal:
“Apart from candidates of our own party, there are two kinds of candidates that we are prepared to support in the coming election. The first would be candidates of workers’ parties, no matter how small, whose platforms are similar enough to our own to justify such support. (I wonder just what parties these may be – D.M.) The second are those candidates who represent a substantial body of organized workers and whose success in the elections would constitute a gain for the principles of independent working class political action; these we support despite our disagreement with the platform on which they are running.
“Thus we support those candidates of the American Labor Party in New York and the Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota who are running solely as the candidates of their own parties and are not also the candidates of bourgeois parties.”
This includes Jack Altman, who is running on the A.L.P. ticket alone for the good and sufficient reason that there was no possibility of making a deal with either of the bourgeois parties in the Twenty-Third Congressional district. (Just how much of a blow for “the principle of independent working class political action” Altman’s candidacy in striking may be gauged by any one who drops in at A.L.P. clubhouses in the Bronx and tries to find some Altman literature in the snowstorm of Roosevelt-Wallace pamphlets on display.)
“It is equally clear,” concluded the political masterminds of the Appeal, “that no progressive purpose would be served by supporting the candidates of the various petty-bourgeois pacifist sects – the Norman Thomas Socialist Party, the ‘Workers Party’, the Socialist Labor Party, etc. Their platforms can only delude the workers in this time of war and militarism.”
And so, with iron logic, the S.W.P. concludes that the war-mongering labor faker, Jack Altman, because he bears a “labor” label, must be supported against the revolutionary anti-war candidate, Max Shachtman. If the Socialist Labor Party communication printed above may, be called an example of political psychopathology, this stand of the S.W.P. may be termed “political surrealism”.
Finally, the Appeal terms the Workers Party a “petty-bourgeois pacifist sect” and states that its program “can only delude the workers”. The platform on which Shachtman is running in the Bronx is printed elsewhere in this issue. I challenge the editors of the Appeal to demonstrate precisely wherein this platform is “petty-bourgeois” or “pacifist” and also just how it will “delude the workers.”
 



“WILL WE GO IN?” is the question in every one’s mind. From one point of view, the answer is a matter of life and death. Yet, historically considered, the question is meaningless. We are already “in”. The precise point at which we will formally “enter the war” – i.e., when the US Government will extend its cooperation with the “democratic” belligerents from the economic to the military sphere – this is a technical detail that will be determined by considerations of imperialist strategy and mass psychology. The United States has been in the war since the first shot, and with every month the web of economic interest between this country and the Allies is woven tighter.
 
The “Peace Scare”
As this is written, it looks as though the war may finally have reached the stage of large-scale military operations. This is welcome news to the American business community. To quote the current news-letter of the National City Bank: “Although peace would be the greatest blessing that the world could possibly receive, the reports of peace moves during the past month (March) have been commonly described as a ‘peace scare’ and have been a cause of hesitation in the markets.” Current events in Scandinavia seem to be laying the dread spectre of peace.
It is easy to understand this attitude if one considers what the war, even in its “inactive”‘ phase, has already meant to the American economy. Last spring there were many signs that business was drifting downward to another serious slump. The mounting war tension that summer and the actual outbreak of war in the fall reversed the downward trend. The mere prospect of big orders from the Allies stimulated in the first two months of the war a 20% increase in industrial production, almost the biggest two-months increase on record. The military stalemate that ensued was reflected in a stalemate of American business, which has been drifting in the doldrums for the past few months. If the fighting in Norway develops into big-scale slaughter and destruction, prosperity will come back over here.
The dynamic effects this would have on our economy can be grasped if one considers that, even in the first six inactive months of the war, American exports have been 33% higher than in the same period a year ago. In February, the increase in exports was 59%, and if the current rate continues, 1940 exports will be $4,500,000,000 as against $3,200,000,000 for 1939. The greatest boom has been in aircraft, where 75% of Allied buying to date has been concentrated, and on which they plan to spend over here a special fund of $1,000,000,000. The national productive capacity has tripled in the past year, now standing at 12,000 planes a year, and by the end of 1940 it is expected capacity will be 30,000. The most optimistic possible calculation of the number of new planes that might be needed per year by our own commercial airlines is 7,000 – and this total assumes that the air lines would be carrying all the present Pullman passengers, as well as all railway express shipments and all first-class mail. No wonder they talk about a “‘peace scare”.
How admirably conscious of the interests of American imperialism is the occupant of the White House, is revealed by a recent article in Time describing the expansion and transformation of the United States Army under President Roosevelt:
“Any foreign military attaché looking at the new US Army will recognize it for what it is: a standing expeditionary force, designed for prompt conscript expansion into an expeditionary army of 750,000 active troops, 250,000 reserves ... Remembering that the US Army has fought in China. Siberia, Central America, and France, the General Staff has planned an outfit ready to be packed up and sent anywhere. The last place the Army expects to fight is on the US mainland.”
 
New Deal Into War Deal
President Roosevelt exerts his remarkable political talents to maneuver the country into the war on the side of the Allies not because he is personally inhumane or villainous, not because he is in the pay of “Wall Street”, but simply because he is a responsible bourgeois statesman.
A review of the last decade of our history shows that war is the only perspective left for American capitalism. The basic problem that has long confronted our capitalist society is how to find big enough markets to absorb profitably the goods produced so plentifully by our superbly rationalized industrial system. The problem became acute with the 1929 stock market crash and the onset of the depression. The Hoover Administration tried, and failed, to solve it by a conservative defense of the status quo. Between 1933 and 1937, the New Deal worked out a temporary solution along reformist lines, based on the theory of the State intervening to moderate the class struggle and to redistribute national income by increasing the purchasing power of the masses. The State tried to prop up the mass market for the products of industry by means of heavy governmental spending, and also, indirectly, by legislation designed to strengthen labor’s bargaining position and to bring Wall Street and big business under some degree of State control. But the pressure of the big bourgeoisie, supported by conservative rural and small town elements, made progress in a reformist direction more and more difficult within the framework of capitalism. By the end of 1936, Federal expenditures had been reduced to the vanishing point. In the spring of 1937, the conservatives won the Supreme Court fight, a warning signal to Roosevelt that his leadership, was now, for the first time, seriously challenged. His response, characteristic of reformist politicians, was to try to placate his enemies by even greater concessions. In 1937, the Federal Government, for the first time since the beginning of the New Deal, took more out of the national income in taxes than it contributed in its spending programs. The result was the sharpest business decline in the nation’s history: the farm price index stood at 128 in May, 1937, at 92 in May, 1938; the Federal Reserve index of industrial production in that period slumped from 118 to 76.
This 1937 collapse was even more significant than the 1929 crash: it showed that American capitalism could no longer sustain itself within the borders of the United States unless the domestic market received regular blood-transfusions of Government spending. When this reformist course became politically impossible, Roosevelt lost no time in turning to the only alternative under capitalism: an aggressive world imperialist policy to win fresh markets and investment fields for American capitalism abroad. A war drive, furthermore, would get the support of those big bourgeois interests that violently opposed the “New Deal” reformist program of the New Deal. And it would distract the masses’ attention from the collapse of that reformist program. A few weeks after the first big break in the stock market in the fall of 1937, Roosevelt announced his new imperialist policy in the famous Chicago (“Quarantine the Aggressor!”) speech.
 
The War Deal: Four Phases
Since the war began last fall, the Administration’s war drive has gone through three phases, and now is entering a fourth.

Full Speed Ahead! Beginning in the middle of summer and continuing through the first month of the war, President Roosevelt boldly steered a course for open aid to the Allies and speedy participation in the war as a belligerent. The War Resources Board was set up with much fanfare, patriotic spy hunts were encouraged by the Department of Justice, the Neutrality Proclamation was frankly un-neutral, and the whole weight of the Administration was put behind the campign to repeal the Neutrality Act. Hand in hand with these war preparations went a frank turn towards Wall Street. Roosevelt personally intervened to crush the WPA strike; his secretary admitted the “Brains Trust” was “out the window”, while in the window came Wall Street bankers and reactionary economists to replace them; the personnel of the all-powerful War Resources Board was about equally divided between “DuPont men” and “Morgan men”; the reactionary Paul McNutt was added to the Cabinet.
 
Backwater. As the Congressional debate on repealing the Neutrality Act opened, the Administration began to backwater on its war drive. Roosevelt had miscalculated, like practically every one else, the speed with which the war would develop; when it became clear that a long stalemate had begun and that the Allies would need no armed aid from America for a while, Roosevelt put the war drive into reverse. He found he had also miscalculated as to the temper of public opinion; the unprecedented flood of anti-war letters and telegrams which descended on Congress as the neutrality debate opened was a surprise to the Administration – and also food for serious thought. Roosevelt stopped talking in public about his sympathy for the Allies, leaving the fight against the Neutrality Act in the hands of the Administration’s floor leaders, who worked quietly behind the scenes. The War Resources Board was hastily disbanded, and Roosevelt refused to release its report on the grounds of “no public interest”. The “Brains Trust” flew in the window again, and Messers. Baillie of J. & W. Seligman, Burgess of National City Bank, and other such went back to Wall Street. The Neutrality Act was repealed, but the Administration was forced to yield important concessions.
 
Proceed with Caution. As the war settled into a stalemate, with diplomatic and economic strategists replacing the generals, and as the strong anti-war sentiment of the masses became ever clearer, the Administration resumed its pressure for war, but with the greatest caution. Its energies were devoted mostly to making easier the purchase of airplanes by the Allies and to building up our own war machine. This was a period of watchful waiting, with eyes on Europe for the signal that slaughter had really begun and that American armed aid was needed.
 
Full Speed Again? Already the fighting in Scandinavia has had its effect over here. American interests in Norway and Denmark are not great: a total investment of $221,000,000; exports of $30,600,000 to the three Scandinavian nations in the first two months of this year, out of a total of $715,000,000 exports; only one Scandinavian product which is of major importance to American industry – Norwegian wood pulp, used in rayon manufacturing. But the point is not, of course, Scandinavia itself but far greater interests. Already pressure is being put on Dewey to disavow the quasi-isolationist stand which has made him the best vote-getter in the race for the Republican nomination. Already there are rumblings in the press about the Nazi flag being planted in Greenland, Denmark’s possession. (President Roosevelt, after consulting various atlases and encyclopedias, has now pronounced Greenland to be definitely a part of the North American continent and hence within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine.)

Two days after the first news of the Nazi invasion, the NY World-Telegram editorialized:
“Congress has been chipping corners off the national defense program. The news from Northern Europe ought to put a stop to that. In fact, the Senate Appropriations Committee took one look at the newspapers yesterday and restored to a War Department bill the $15,000,000 fund for starting a third set of Panama Canal locks – an item which the House had dropped.”
The next day the Senate Appropriations Committee reported out without any cuts a naval bill for $967,400,000 for the coming fiscal year, biggest in history. Up to the Scandinavian flare-up, Congress had been following a course most distasteful to the Administration, of cutting army and navy appropriations and increasing farm, relief, and other non-military appropriations. However, “the news from Northern Europe ought to put a stop to that”.
The interests of American capitalism require our participation in the war. But there is an increasingly powerful pressure of mass sentiment against participation. (How much this will be changed by the actual outbreak of major hostilities, with possible large-scale Nazi bombings, remains to be seen.) This sentiment has greatly increased since the beginning of the war. Early in September, Gallup asked: “If it appears that Germany is defeating England and France, should the US declare war on Germany and send out army and navy to Europe to fight?’’ Two out of five answered: “Yes”. But when the same question was asked in February, only one out of five said “Yes”. The American masses share the apathy and cynicism of their European brothers as to the war aims of the “democracies”.
 




Norman Thomas Converts the Heathen
There is no question about it. Norman Thomas has a remarkable
talent for charming middle class audiences and for getting himself
into the headlines. These are gifts which any leader of the left
might well envy – and try to emulate. The energy and ingenuity
with which he peddles painless “socialism” must be
admired.
But I have long suspected that one reason Mr. Thomas so readily
fascinates and persuades the middle classes is because, in his
eagerness to win them over, he leans so far over in their direction
as to make his own position – to the political layman, at least
– practically indistinguishable from that of his audience. He
is so very idealistic and respectable and so excessively anxious to
be "fair” and to avoid stepping on any of the prejudices
of his listeners, that what usually seems to happen is that the
missionary leaves the meeting firmly committed to the cause of
cannibalism. At least, that’s the way it looks to the
cannibals.
Remarkable confirmation of this theory comes from a personal
letter which last week happened to come into my hands. It was written
by a rather conservative young married woman living in Chicago to an
extremely conservative older woman in New York. I excerpt the section
dealing with a recent debate between Norman Thomas and Hamilton Fish
in Chicago – one of a series being held throughout the nation:
“The thing was posted as a debate between Norman
Thomas and Hamilton Fish, but ended by being a symposium on ‘Can We
Keep Out of War?’ They both forgot their politics (for once) and were
two good Americans agreeing on the same subject. They both were of
the same opinion, that we could keep out if we would stop policing
the Pacific, mind our own business, and stop trying to play ‘God’
about affairs that did not concern us.
“It was truly a wonderful evening, and I left
Thorne Hall with a feeling of joyousness at being an American and an
enemy of Revolution and uprising. Why? Oh why can’t people
accept things is they are when they know from past experience how
terrible can be the results?”
It is clear that this missionary to the heathen – who
“forgets” his politics so conveniently – will never
end up in the cannibals’ stew pot. Rather is he preparing
bigger and better stew-pots for future missionaries who are foolish
enough to insist on remembering their politics.
 

American Standard of Living
The great argument of those who defend the capitalist system in
this country is that the American standard of living is the highest
in the world.
Such orators should be referred to the second chapter of The
Structure of the American Economy, the survey by the National
Resources Committee on which I commented last week. In this chapter,
called The Structure of Wants, the tremendous class
differences in this “democracy” of ours are charted in
unmistakeable form. Here we learn that the richest 20% of the
nation’s families receive every year half the total income of
the country, getting as much as the remaining 80% of the families put
together. Here we learn that half the families in the country somehow
keep going on an income of less than $1,000 a year, and one-tenth on
less than $340 a year.
These are family incomes, it should be remembered. The
average American family consists of father, mother and two children.
According to these figures, half the people of the United States have
less than sixty-nine cents apiece per day with which to buy their
food, clothing, shelter, etc. Even, allowing for the single
individuals who are counted here as family units, you still would get
something under a dollar a day per person.
 

Bread or Books?
A table on page eleven shows concretely just what this huge
difference in incomes means. Here we find that a consumer with an
income of between $5,000 and $10,000 a year eats five times as much
food (in dollar value) as a consumer with an income between $500 and
$750 (who is by no means at the bottom of the ladder, since at least
15% of all families have less than $500 a year), that he spends
eleven times as much on books, 30 times as much on recreation, and 45
times as much on his children’s education. This last item is
especially significant, since such differences in education intensify
and perpetuate class differences.
People can get along without shoes, without any clothes to speak
of, without books and chairs and medicine, but the two things they
must have are food and shelter. In these charts, the lower the
income level sinks, the bigger is the percentage spent on food and
housing, until when you get down to the lowest tenth of the families
the struggle for existence is so grim that three-quarters of the
income must go for these two necessities of life. Contrast this with
the very wealthiest families, those with incomes of $10,000 and over,
who spend only 40% of their incomes on food and housing.
The extent of starvation and semi-starvation among the masses in
this land of plenty is strikingly shown by a single statistic in this
chapter: the authors estimate that if the national income were
increased by two-thirds, expenditures on food would be 44% greater
than they are today. “This is particularly significant,”
they add mildly, “since it is so often stated that the demand
for food is limited.”
 

Mass Markets – and Mass Poverty
All of this has ominous economic, as well as social, implications.
Our mass production industries depend on a mass market to make money.
But the tendency of monopoly capitalism is to concentrate income in
the wealthy classes and to reduce the masses to ever lower depths of
poverty. Economically, this is ultimately fatal for a number of
reasons, one of them being that the masses spend almost all their
income on consumer’s goods (thus keeping the market humming)
while the wealthy spend comparatively little and pile up ever bigger
savings (which can only be used to build more factories, whose
products must then still further crowd the market). The handful of
families at the top, those with incomes of over $10,000 a year, save
half their income, while all families with $l,000 or less income
(more than half the total number of families in the country) actually
spend more each year than their income, going deeper into debt the
farther down the scale their income is, until finally the bottom ten
per cent spend more than half again as much as they take in each
year. [1] (This piling up of debt also works to undermine the mass
market.)
Already the process of concentration of wealth has gone so far
that half the national income goes to the richest fifth of the
nation’s families. And these save from 10% to 50% of their
incomes, depending on the degree of their wealth. It is these
families, furthermore, and not the masses, which will get the lion’s
share of any future periods of boom prosperity. “An increase in
consumer income of 33%,” write the authors, “could be
expected to result in an increase of only 25% in expenditures on
consumption and an increase of nearly 100% in savings.” The
only solution of this particular contradiction of our monopoly
capitalism would be to increase the incomes of the great mass of
“consuming families” at the expense of the incomes of the
handful of “saving families.” This is more or less what
the left wing of the New Deal was half-heartedly trying to do up to
the economic collapse that began in the fall of 1937. But since the
wealthy families controlled the system, and since the New Dealers had
no wish to basically alter this system, the fight did not get very
far. It has now been completely lost in the martial music of the War
Deal.

What Happened to the Workers Alliance?
As the Roosevelt-Woodrum-Bricker-LaGuardia drive against the
unemployed shifts into high, as federal, state and local relief
standards are forced down to ever more subhuman levels, many of the
unemployed are no doubt wondering what hit the Workers Alliance. How
can it be that a once-militant union like the Alliance has collapsed
so miserably?
For an excellent brief description of what has happened to the
Workers Alliance we have only to go to Herbert Benjamin, who has been
for years the Stalinist power behind the throne of Alliance president
David Lasser. Writes Comrade Benjamin, in an article on The
Unemployed Movement in the U.S.A.:
“The great masses are still subject to the
illusion that some easy and ‘painless’ way can be found
of solving their urgent problems. Opportunist elements cater to these
illusions ... They encourage the workers to believe that mass action
is unnecessary, that the leaders can induce relief authorities to
improve relief standards and eliminate abuses. In place of mass
action they employ more or less friendly negotiations between
unemployed leaders and relief officials, who are quite willing to
encourage this kind of relationship because they realize that it will
undermine the power of the unemployed organization ... The membership
is deprived of its initiative, its militancy is vitiated, illusions
are promoted, and its leadership becomes corrupted.”
Comrade Benjamin is not “confessing”. He wrote these
words in The Communist for June 1935. The history of the
Workers Alliance – a history he himself is largely responsible
for – bears out word for word the accuracy of his analysis. No,
Comrade Benjamin is not “confessing” – but can he
put off the day much longer?
 

Socialism Comes to Finland
For weeks now the Daily Worker has been reporting Red Army
victories in Finland, victories which have been suppressed by the
rest of the press. So, too, with the advance of socialism into
Finland behind the tanks of the Red Army. Of the giant strides
towards Stalino-socialism reported by the Daily Worker day
after day, not a word in the N.Y. Times. But now at last a
stride has been made that is so gigantic that even the lying
bourgeois press doesn’t dare to suppress it.
It seems that on December 11, 1939 – historic date! –
the inhabitants of the Finnish village of Karku assembled and elected
a “committee of the Working People’s Front in Karku”.
(The Times does not specify just where Karku is, but we may
assume, considering the progress of the Red Army, that it is fairly
close to the border.) This was no paper organization. At once the
Working People’s Front swung into action. Boldly, it took over
the goods of a local trading company and, after making a careful
inventory of them, it proclaimed a reduction in the price of matches
from 2 marks to 1½ marks. Nor did the Working People’s
Front stop there in its headlong rush towards socialism. It marked
salt down from 2½ to 1½ marks, and slashed the price of
coffee from 20 to 16 marks a pound.
This revolutionary action – coming dangerously close to
outright expropriation – was in line with the equally daring
program of Comrade Kuusinen’s “Finnish People’s
Government”. It is true the Kuusinen regime felt it prudent to
proclaim their respect for private property. (After all, they’re
respectable bureaucrats, not adventurists and putschists.) But they
didn’t hesitate to raise such revolutionary demands as the
eight-hour day and even vacations with pay. Nor can Comrade Kuusinen
be blamed if these particular demands happen to have been won, years
ago, by the Finnish labor unions. He hasn’t been in Finland for
a long time.
But it must be admitted that Comrade Kuusinen made a bad mistake
when he omitted from his revolutionary program any reference to
collective farming. He had excellent reasons for this omission: he
thought the Finnish landlords wouldn’t like it. But nonetheless
it turns out to have been a bad tactical error. For now, according to
the N.Y. Times of Jan. 5, the Mannerheim-Tanner regime is
expected to introduce “the Russian collective farm system”
itself in order to prosecute the war more successfully.
Discouraging days for Comrade Kuusinen, whose revolutionary
program turns out to be lagging behind not only the Finnish labor
fakers but even behind the Finnish bourgeois government itself. But
anyway, matches now cost ½ mark less in Karku.
 

Correction
Towards the end of last week’s column this amazing statement
occurred: “The handful of families at the top, those with
incomes of over $10,000 a year (more than half the total number of
families in the country) actually spend more each year than their
incomes ...” This should read: “The handful of families
at the top, those with incomes of over $10,000 a year, save half
their income, while all families with $l,000 or less income (more
than half the total number of families in the country) actually spend
more each year than their income”, etc., etc.

A Little Anthology of War Poetry, No. 2
The British Broadcasting Company recently broadcast to the Empire
a new war song, which goes as follows:



Run Adolf, run Adolf; run, run, run;
Look what you’ve been gone and done, done, done;
We will knock the stuffing out of you,
Field Marshal Goering and Goebbels too.
You’ll lose your place in the sun, sun, sun;
Soon you poor dog, you’ll get none, none none.
You will flop with Herr von Ribbentrop,
So run Adolf, run Adolf; run, run, run.



The title of this song, according to the British Broadcasting
Company, is Run, Adolf, Run.
 




Pocket Money for Brenda
It costs a lot to keep a debutante in operation. It has been
revealed, for example, that the upkeep and running expenses on Brenda
Frazier will come to about $52,000 for the coming year. At least that
is the amount which Surrogate James A. Foley has authorized Brenda’s
mama to spend “for the support and maintenance” of her
nineteen-year-old daughter next year. (Brenda is still a minor, hence
her mother must get legal permission to spend any of her daughter’s
income.) The $52,000 will be spent on “living expenses,
entertainment, and social and charitable activities”. As
Brenda’s mama explained to the surrogate, although Brenda is a
minor in the eyes of the law, “she is in fact a grown woman
moving in the society in which, because of her parents’ and
grandparents' background, she has taken a definite place”. Very
definite, in fact just $52,000 a year.
 

What Is Happening to the Soviet Economy?
The question of what is happening to Soviet production becomes
more and more important. The military significance is clear. One
reason for the remarkably effective resistance the Finns have put up
to the Red Army is the comparatively vigorous and healthy state of
Finland’s economy. (I am speaking, of course, in terms of
production, not social relations.) According to the January 15 issue
of the Cleveland Trust Company’s Business Bulletin,
Finland’s record of industrial production since 1926 is
internationally outstanding. Taking 1929 as 100, the index of
production for Finland now stands at 162, and even in the depth of
the depression it never went below 80. (The American index, on the
other hand, sunk below 60 at the depth of the depression, and is now
only about 90.) The difficulties Stalin has been having with the
third Five Year Plan, on the other hand, are well known.
But the significance of the breakdown that seems to be more and
more evident in Soviet production goes beyond its effect on the
conduct of the war. The more acute becomes the contradiction between
the interests of the bureaucracy and the nationalized economy and the
more the latter is strangled by the bureaucratic clutch, then the
greater becomes the need for Stalin to cement fast his alliance with
Nazi Germany, which has the industrial machinery and technicians to
prop up a while longer the collapsing Soviet industrial structure.
The tightening of the Nazi-Soviet alliance may therefore be expected
to keep equal pace with the mounting difficulties of Soviet
production.
Since I do not read Russian, I am cut off from the chief sources
of information on this subject. But the N.Y. Times has lately
carried a few items of interest.
In a Moscow report dated January 17, it was stated that, although
the State Planning Commission’s 1939 production figures claim a
gain over 1938 they do not specify, as has hitherto been the case,
what percentage of the Plan was fulfilled. This would seem to
indicate that the Plan was not carried out.
There were several significant accounts of the blackout which has
been attempted in Moscow. It seems that this was unsuccessful because
of the fact that 90% of Moscow’s families have no window
curtains because of the “acute textile shortage”, and
cannot paste up black paper because there is also a paper shortage.
The only alternative is to use blue electric light bulbs, but it
seems there is also a shortage of blue electric light bulbs.
Another report, dated Dec. 10, states: “During the blackout,
robberies and thefts have increased.” Theft is a social
manifestation which can have only one origin: unequal distribution
and scarcity of material goods.
In this connection, it is interesting to note Trotsky’s
statement in a recent issue of Liberty: “In the USSR
there are twelve to fifteen million privileged individuals who
concentrate in their hands about one half of the national incomes,
and who call this regime ‘Socialism’. On the other hand,
there are about 160,000,000 people oppressed by the bureaucracy and
caught in the grip of poverty.” If this is “socialism,”
as the lying Stalinist press claims, then we have socialism over here
right now – and even a more advanced stage of socialism, since,
according to the National Resources Committee, the richest tenth of
the nation’s families concentrate in their hands not half, but
“only” 36% of the national income.
Finally, the Times of Jan. 19 carried a government report
on exports of gasoline which showed that exports to the USSR jumped
from 48,000 barrels in October to 318,500 in November and have
remained at that level ever since. This increase, it is believed, is
going not to Germany via Russia, but is being used by the Red Army in
the Finnish invasion. Considering that oil is one thing the USSR is
especially rich in, and that Germany hopes to get much of her oil
supply from the USSR, this is startling news indeed. Apparently,
Soviet oil production is in such a bad state that it is necessary to
increase imports of American gasoline six times in order to
supply the Red Army. (This may be due to a decline in crude oil
production, but more probably it is due to the inability of Russian
refineries to produce sufficient gasoline of high enough quality for
airplane motors.) Russian crude oil exports, which were 7,000,000
tons in 1932, by 1938 had sunk to 1,000,000 tons. No wonder Stalin
looks with increasing desperation to Hitler’s technicians and
machinery to save the Kremlin bureaucracy from the economic impasse
they are now in.
 




Jekyll into Hyde
In the past year, President Roosevelt has openly put himself at
the head of the reactionary crusade to cut down relief and
reintroduce Hoover starvation for the unemployed. (Hoover gave them
breadlines and played with the idea of processing and sterilizing
garbage for use by the nation’s jobless. Roosevelt gives them
surplus commodities – and they have to dig out their own
garbage, unprocessed and unsterilized.)
This has provoked a great wailing and gnashing of teeth among
Roosevelt’s friends or ex-friends in the labor movement. Since
his budget message, advocating drastic WPA cuts, there has begun in
some quarters a campaign to put across the fairy tale that Roosevelt
has only now “yielded” to reactionary pressure on relief,
that up to 1939, he was the peerless champion of the unemployed. This
line is now being peddled in the Daily Worker and the CIO
News. It is an attempt to get out from under. These papers now
claim the Roosevelt they so loyally supported for so long was a
different fellow entirely from the Roosevelt of today. The good Dr.
Jekyll has suddenly changed into the wicked Mr. Hyde.
 

Nothing Left but the Smile
Today’s paper brings a report of the convention of the New
York state Workers Alliance. The Alliance has now become very
critical of Roosevelt, for reasons which have nothing to do with the
interests of the unemployed but a great deal to do with the interests
of Stalin – and Hitler. “There has been a drastic change
in the policies of President Roosevelt in the past year,”
reported the Alliance bureaucrats, and they led the convention in
singing a song which began:



There was a man named Roosevelt
Began to do what the people felt;
The New Deal came and stayed a while,
But all that’s left is Roosevelt’s smile.



Especially disillusioned by Roosevelt’s recent actions was
Herbert Benjamin, the Stalinist secretary of the Alliance. “WPA
is not what she used to be,” he said sadly. As for Roosevelt –
“His beautiful phrases of yesterday ring hollow today.”
 

A Glance at the Record
Let’s look at the record as to Roosevelt and relief. When
did he begin his campaign against the unemployed ? I told the story
in great detail in the September 1939 issue of the New
International, but a few of the basic facts may well be repeated
here.

The only time in the entire history of the Roosevelt
Administration that its relief program came anywhere near providing
for all the unemployed was during the four months of November
through February, 1933–1934, when the Civil Works
Administration works program gave jobs to some 4,000,000 of the
8,000,000 then unemployed, while Federal grants-in-aid to the states
took care of most of the rest. (MOST, by no means all.)
 
Roosevelt has been for years trying to cut Federal relief
expenditures. Opening shot in the campaign was fired not in his
budget message of a few weeks ago, but in the one he sent to
Congress on January 4, 1935. This proposed that Federal relief aid
to the states be discontinued and that the Government limit itself
to WPA work relief. This new program was laid down at a joint
meeting of the National Industrial Conference Board and the National
Association of Manufacturers. The keynote of this 1935 relief
message was the flat statement by Roosevelt: ‘‘The
Federal Government must and shall quit this business of relief.”
 
In theory, WPA was to provide jobs for all able-bodied
unemployed. In practice, it has never provided more than 3,500,000
jobs, while the total number of such unemployed has varied between
8,000,000 and 12,000,000. At no time has WPA provided jobs for more
than a third of the ABLE-BODIED, EMPLOYABLE unemployed. This means
that the great majority of the employables and ALL the unemployables
have been left to the mercies of the states and localities –
where relief standards are only from half to a TENTH of even the
very low WPA wage rates. The recent breakdown of relief in Cleveland
was as much due to Roosevelt’s policies as to the brutal
inhumanity of the Republican Governor of Ohio.
 
There has been a lot of pious moaning about Roosevelt’s
insistence on cutting the union wage scale out of WPA last summer,
and his vicious smashing of the strike that resulted. Actually, it
was merely a repeat performance. The first event in the history of
WPA, in the summer of 1935, was a now forgotten strike against
Roosevelt’s insistence on eliminating union wage rates from
the newborn WPA. At that time, too, he issued “You can’t
strike against the government!” statements, and did his best
to cut strikers off all relief rolls, Federal or local. He lost out
that time because the union movement was too strong for him. But he
waited his chance and last summer, when labor was already in
retreat, he struck his blow again – this time successfully.
 
Finally, it is interesting to note that as early as
October 23, 1935, Roosevelt was “disappointing” his
left-wing admirers. The Nation of that date lamented: “The
fine social consciousness which characterized the early days of the
New Deal appears to have faded.” Alas!

 




American Class Consciousness
The most interesting thing in the new U.S.A. issue of
Fortune is the latest instalment of the Fortune
Survey. Just how accurate and scientifically unbiassed this
national poll is, I don’t know. (It came remarkably close to
the 1936 presidential election results.) But to the extent that it is
an accurate reflection of public opinion, this month’s
instalment makes sober reading
That the social and economic conditions for the transference of
power from the bourgeoisie to the workers have, in this country, been
ripe for some time – this, I think, can easily be demonstrated.
But Fortune’s Survey would seem to indicate that
this is far from being yet reflected in mass consciousness.
The question was asked: “What word would you use to name the
class in America you belong to?” To this, 47% answered “middle
class”, 15% said “working class”, and 28% said they
didn’t know.
Another question: “Do you think the interests of employers
and employees are, by their very nature, opposed, or are they
basically the same?” 56% answered “the same”, 25%
said “opposed”, the rest didn’t know. Factory
workers, as one would expect, were the most class conscious here:
here – and yet more of even this section of the masses thought
class interests were “basically the same” (41%) than
thought they were opposed (37%).
Asked: “What do you really think would be a satisfactory
income for you?”, exactly half of all answering named sums of
$2,500 a year and under. It is true that even such an income is far
below what most people get today, but to be content with so little
shows a dangerous mood of humility and resignation among the masses.
The most ominous finding was that, while 49% thought anybody at
any time should have the right of free speech, almost as many (44%)
said they would “prohibit some”. And of these latter,
much the biggest proportion (40%) defined the “some” they
would gag as “Browder, communists, reds, radicals, Thomas,
socialists”. The next biggest gag group was the 18% in favor of
denying free speech to “Kuhn, Bund Leaders, Nazis, Fascists”.
This would seem to indicate that “reds” are about twice
as unpopular in this country at the moment as fascists. (It would
have been interesting and valuable to have had this same question
asked before the Hitler-Stalin Pact. I venture to guess that the
anti-”red” sentiment would have been appreciably
weaker.
 

The People Reject War
As the war drags on, its sterile, futile, reactionary character
becomes increasingly clear to the American masses. In the first week
of the war, the Gallup Poll asked the question: “If it appears
that Germany is defeating England and France, should the United
States declare war on Germany and send our army and navy to Europe to
fight?” To this, 44% said “Yes”, 56% said “No”.
The same question was asked a few weeks ago. This time 23% said
“Yes”, 77% “No”. In the same way, the
percentage of those who think the U.S. will stay out of the European
war has risen from 54% last October to a current figure of 68%.
This swing in public sentiment, which set in a few weeks after the
war began, has forced the Roosevelt Administration to soft-pedal its
jingoistic pro-Ally propaganda, and to backwater on its war plans.
But it would be folly to imagine either that the Administration has
given up its plans for getting the country into the war on the side
of the “democracies”, or that the present trend of public
feeling cannot be reversed in the near future. No amount of popular
hatred of war will by itself suffice to keep the country out
of the present war. This mass sentiment must be organized and given
expression by powerful labor and radical organizations if it is to
play an important role.
 

But Capitalism Demands War
Regardless of what the masses think and want, the economic
necessities of American capitalism press the nation inexorably
towards participation in the war. The links of gold and steel which
bind our economy to that of the rest of world imperialism are far
stouter than the simple-minded, provincial “isolationist”
believes. At the present time, for example, eleven billions of
American money are in long-term investments abroad. Last year’s
exports were higher than in 1938, and the month of December, 1939, in
particular, was 37% above December, 1938.
Furthermore, the character of this trade has changed in recent
years in such a way as to link American economy more tightly to
European wars. A comparison of the chief items of export in 1926–1930
with 1939, shows that raw cotton has had the biggest drop (11%), iron
and steel mill products the biggest rise (9%). In general, decreases
are in farm products and consumers’ goods, while the increases
are in such war materials as aircraft, oil, chemicals, iron and steel
scrap. In a word, the United States ten years ago was the provisioner
of Europe, today is the armorer of Europe.
There is space here to mention only one other tie: the enormous
flow of gold from Europe to the safe haven of this country in the
last few years. Since 1934, Fortune estimates that
$10,500,000,000 of European gold has been received here; of which
only $2,800,000,000 was in settlement of foreign trade balances. The
rest represented “a vast, unwelcome entrance of foreign
capital” in the form of short-term bank balances and foreign
investments in American securities.
According to a recent report of the U.S. Department of Commerce,
this inflow of gold from Europe has been greatly stimulated by the
war. In 1938 the total inflow was $1,500,000,000; last year it was
just double that figure, namely $3,000,000,000. As soon as the war
abroad becomes “serious”, this torrent of gold pouring
Westward across the Atlantic will set in motion an Eastward
counter-current of American guns and copper and oil and chemicals. No
capitalist government can withstand the gravitational pull of this
economic interaction between America and Europe. It will become a
question not of whether to enter the war, but purely as to how to get
the country in. And this second problem can be solved by the ruling
class more easily than the isolationists realize.
 




The “Break-Even Point”
Much has been written about technological unemployment, hut I have
seen little discussion of one aspect of the problem: the steadily
increasing ability of American industry to make profits at ever-lower
levels of production. A key statistic in any industry is the
“break-even point”, i.e., the percentage of a plant’s
productive capacity which must be used in order to operate at a
profit. In the steel industry, for example, this is now between 40
per cent and 45 per cent – that is to say, once the average
steel plant begins to run at a rate which produces 45 per cent as
much steel as it can produce at full capacity, it begins to make
money.
This means that an industry with a break-even point of 45 per cent
– and in many industries the point is even lower – can
make profits even though it is producing less than half the amount of
goods its plants can produce. Thus the national consumption of these
goods can be reduced to half that of boom times, employment can be
far below the boom level, and the industry in question can still make
money.
There is another interesting thing about this break-even point:
once production reaches that level, profits begin to increase much
faster than production. If a steel company makes, say $5 a ton at 50
per cent of capacity, its rate of profit at 60 per cent of capacity
may well be not $5 a ton but $7 or $8. Thus it is often possible to
double and triple profits with only a slight rise in production. The
reason for this is that a highly mechanized mass production plant
costs a certain minimum to run at all: it takes about as many
employees, as much coal and water and electricity, as much
wear-and-tear on the machinery, to produce steel at 30 per cent of
capacity as at 40 per cent. But once production is high enough to
absorb these minimum fixed charges, then costs for additional
production are reduced to little more than extra wages and raw
materials.
 

Sales Up 58 p.c.; Profits 910 p.c.
In the first quarter of 1939 the automobile industry gave a
dramatic illustration of the above point. In that period, the net
profits of the six leading automobile manufacturers were $65,500,000,
as against only $6,500,000 for the same quarter of 1938. The increase
in production, however, was very much less: sales of trucks and cars
for that quarter of 1939 totalled 1,056,000, as against 669,000 in
1938. Thus an increase of 58 per cent in sales caused an increase of
910 per cent in profits.

Earnings and Employment
The mysterious workings of the “break-even point” are
one reason for the phenomenon we see today of enormous increases in
profits unaccompanied by any significant rise in the national
standard of living or any significant decrease in the number of the
unemployed.
As the readers of the Appeal are well aware, one out of
every five families in the nation is starving and stagnating in the
ranks of the unemployed. And, as I noted here a few weeks ago, only
13 out of every hundred of those dropped from WPA last summer have
been able to find jobs in private industry.
Yet last year’s earnings of most big companies were
spectacular. Goodyear Tire & Rubber reported 63 per cent higher
profits in 1939 than in 1938 ... U.S. Steel lost $7,700,000 in 1938,
made $41,200,000 in 1939 ... DuPont made $50,200,000 in 1938,
$93,200,000 in 1939 ... Inland Steel’s net rose from $4,900,000
to $10,900,000. The National City Bank predicts that 370 leading
manufacturers will report 1939 earnings totalling $329,000,000, which
is double the 1938 figure.
If figures mean anything, these statistics mean that American
capitalism can function with the utmost efficiency as a profit
system, simultaneously with the utmost inefficiency as a social
system. And since the bourgeoisie judge the desirability of
capitalism by its ability to make profits, while the workers judge it
by its ability to produce and distribute material goods – this
being the case, there is inevitably a basic clash of class
interests.
 

Mass Production and Mass Misery
This class conflict the bourgeoisie, both liberal and
conservative, try to explain away with the well-worn thesis that
American capitalism is “different” from that of Europe in
that it is based on mass production and hence on the idea of a mass
market. The assumption is that our capitalism must progress to ever
higher levels of production and consumption because only thus can our
great corporations find a market big enough to absorb their huge
productive capacity. Hence the common interest of the employer and of
the employee lies in increasing production and consumption (or
sales). The conservatives repeat, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
“What is Good for Business is Good for You!” The liberals
talk of an “economy of plenty” (as against the typical
European “economy of scarcity”). The New Deal spending
philosophy is based on this conception of the mass market being the
logical corollary of mass production.
It is true that when industrial production falls below a certain
minimum level (the national “break-even point”, so to
speak), the bourgeoisie lose money and, of course, society as a whole
is in a bad way. But, as we have seen, once the break-even point is
reached, profits become rapidly less and less dependent on increased
production. It seems probable that the future development of American
capitalism will be in the direction of extracting bigger and bigger
profits out of ever-smaller production. (The great aim of modem
technology is to lower the break-even point.) There is only one
political formula for imposing on the masses the lower living
standards this economic development would make inevitable. Its name
is fascism.
 



This column has often dealt with that significant problem of our
times: the increasing intervention of the state power into social and
economic life. Recently I received a letter from a reader, Egidio
Mattina, which interestingly documents this process as it has been
going on in Italy under Il Duce. It takes as its text this sentence
from a news report: “The Director General of Police in Rome
recently presented to Mussolini statistics tending to prove the
progressive diminishment year by year of crime in Italy.”
 

Il Duce Socializes Crime
“The cause of this diminishment of crime under
Fascism,” writes Mr. Mattina, “is to be found in the
peculiarities of that system of state management, whereby the
Government tends to absorb all criminal tendencies to itself, making
anti-social crime not only hazardous but unprofitable – as
compared to the rich rewards in ‘socialized’
crime. Fascism dares not tolerate independent criminal activity any
more than it can tolerate a ‘free’ press. Hence all
criminal activity must conform strictly to the party line or suffer
outlawry.
“This development is especially interesting because
of the fact that in Italy (except for the most advanced sections of
the North) criminal activity has always traditionally been carried on
not by criminals but rather by outlaws. In enumerating the
achievements of Mussolini, his admirers triumphantly list ‘the
wiping out of the horrible Maffia’ – to which we might
add the Camorra, brigandage, and all the other ragged tatters of
feudalism surviving in the South. Mussolini, the bitter enemy of
feudalism, like the great Napoleon, has stamped them all out.
“It was not so heroic an achievement. The Maffia
and the Camorra were no match for the capitalistic police forces of
Rome and Lombardy and Piedmont. To do the banditti justice,
they were shrewd enough to realize this, and so, where they could,
they donned the black shirt and became ardent Fascisti, rightly
surmising it the next best thing to being a Maffista or Camorrista.
Thus the Maffia ‘disappeared’ by the process of
assimilation. The same is true of crime in general. For them both, it
was merely a case of reinstatement in a more modern form: the police
force of Sicily is now a regular Society of Old Maffistas. This is
what they call Progress.”
 

Italianization with a Small “i”
Socialized crime, my correspondent continues,
“is only one sample of the process of
italianization to which all activity, great or small, must submit
itself under Mussolini. The complete list is staggering. Fascism has
made everything in Italy italian (with a small i). The
countersignature of Mussolini must be on everything, including crime.
“He has italianized Art and artists ... While the
professors and the critics quietly wait for the New Italian
Renaissance, which like Prosperity in America is always just around
the corner in Italy, to make its appearance, they gratefully
acknowledge the one mighty contribution to ‘art’ in
modern Italy – Mussolini’s National Academy.
“He has italianized the banditti of the
South, and it would surprise romantic tourist ladies to know how
easily these desperate orphans suffered themselves to be regimented.
“He has italianized Catholicism which, especially
in the South, has always been the bitter enemy of the State.
“He has italianized the Catholics. He did not have
to italianize the Jews, who are still the best (most chauvinist)
Italians in Italy and who owe whatever unpopularity they have enjoyed
in modern Italy to precisely that reason. (Now, of course, even the
anti-italianism of the people has become ‘italian,’ i.e.,
anti-semitic.)
“He has italianized the clericals. He has
italianized the anti-clericals. He has italianized paganism (the
patriotic paganism of the disciples of D’Annunzio), cynicism
(the patriotic Peglers of Italy) and papism – if not the Pope
himself. He has italianized the unhappy shades of Machiavelli, Dante
and Caesar and all the other ghosts unwary enough to roam the Italian
earth. He has italianized Italy’s share of Heaven and Italy’s
share of Hell.”
 



“All the principal events of his career are surrounded by an atmosphere of secrecy and furtiveness. He moved through the world subterraneously, like a mole burrowing from the sun ... Desiring the fulfillment of the Marxian dream for a proletarian dictatorship, he demanded rebellions everywhere on earth and did his best to bring them about. ‘Only this struggle,’ he insisted, ‘will bring real peace to the blood drenched world.’ But the serenity he wanted was the submission of society to a form of slavery as cruel, as any the mind can conceive ... Now he has died a martyr to the logical development of the errors he taught. But the evil that he did lives after him to the sorrow of millions.”
Thus the Washington Star paid tribute, in its way, to the greatest revolutionary of our age on the day after he was brutally murdered by a GPU pickaxe in the brain. This strange mixture of hatred, fact and nonsense is typical of all the comments in the bourgeois press on Trotsky. The editorial hacks who articulated, in the banal and vulgar phrases of daily journalism, the attitude of the American ruling class towards their fallen enemy, managed to make one thing clear; Stalin’s pickaxe removed from the world scene a leader their bosses hated and feared. The world ruling class has neither forgotten nor forgiven Leon Trotsky for expropriating their Russian colleagues.
 
“Died as He Lived ...”
Far from expressing the slightest human sympathy for the victim or even of indignation over the brutality of the act itself, the bourgeois press played endless variations on the theme expressed most succinctly in the Scripps-Howard press: “Trotsky, who once lived by the sword, died by the pickaxe.”
The Chicago Tribune, whose editorial writer performed the apparently impossible feat of believing both that Jackson was a factional opponent of Trotsky inside the movement and that he was also a GPU agent, put it thus: “If Trotsky dies of this, he will have died as he lived and as all the old Bolshevists died of violence or execution.” The N.Y. Times rose to fiery heights of moral indignation:
“Brutal? Of course it was; but it was no more brutal than the Stalin tyranny as a whole, no more ruthless than the Russian Revolution which this consummate firebrand in exile had himself set alight and kept aflame a generation ago. Trotsky prided himself on, being a true revolutionary who shrank at nothing. The victims of his cold cruelty, and of Lenin’s, can be numbered in the millions; the wastes of Siberia are bleached with their bones.”
 
“No Tears ...”
The frankest in its hatred was that most debased and rotten of warrnongering “left” papers, the Social Democrats’ New Leader, which began its editorial:
“We cannot pretend to weep any bitter tears over the death of Leon Trotsky. The shades of Russian workingmen and peasants whom in his days of glory he caused to be shot down rise between us and his bier.”
Thus the New Leader, which calls itself a “Marxist” organ – the “Marxism” of Noske and Scheidemann! The editors, in fact, went so far in their venomous slandering of Trotsky’s memory that one of their own contributors, Leon Dennen, wrote in a letter of protest.
It is plain that the ruling class, like their ally, Stalin, knows their enemy. The hypocrisy of all this moralizing over Trotsky’s revolutionary blood-letting is exposed by the fact that in the same day’s papers as announced Trotsky’s death could be read articles about women and children being blown to bits by the bombers of England and Germany. The mouthpieces of a capitalist system which for months now has been slaughtering tens of thousands of the people of Poland, England, France, Holland, Norway, Belgium, and Germany – these gentlemen still recall with horror the loss of life in the Russian revolution. The fact is that when people die in a senseless war to perpetuate the existing system of slavery and exploitation called capitalism, their deaths arouse no horror in the breast of editorial writers since such human sacrifices are necessary to maintain “law and order”. But when a revolutionary leader sheds blood to bring a better world into being, he is attacking “law and order” and those who die in the revolution are victims of cruel massacre.
 
The Left-Wing Press
Finally, a few words on what is generally referred to as the left-wing press. (I exclude, of course, the Trotskyist press – Labor Action and the Socialist Appeal.) Workers Age, organ of the Lovestone groups, and the Weekly People, organ of the Socialist Labor Party, are the only papers I have seen which expressed real regret at Trotsky’s death and some sense of his historical greatness as a revolutionist. A section of the Weekly People’s revolutionary tribute is printed elsewhere in this issue. The Socialist Call was very characteristically cautious and lukewarm. committing itself no farther than to note that Stalin had made Trotsky “the last great martyr of the Russian Revolution”. The Nation printed a remarkably sympathetic editorial – perhaps to make up for an earlier article by one Harry Block which implied that the first murder attempt this spring was a fake arranged by Trotsky. The Nation even went so far as to argue that Trotsky would have run the Soviet Union more humanely and intelligently than Stalin has, which is a really amazing thing to read in those pages after the treatment of Trotsky at the time of the Moscow Trials. The New Republic, on the other hand, which has been in the last year much more Stalinized than the Nation, printed an extremely vulgar and malicious editorial note on Trotsky, probably from the pen of Malcolm Cowley. The Stalinist press at first tried to ignore the killing entirely. The only daily paper in New York not to mention the attack within twenty-four hours of its occurrence was the Daily Worker. After Trotsky had died, the Worker ran a front-page news story headed “FOLLOWER OF TROTZKY TELLS MOTIVES IN ASSASSINATION”, as well as a lead editorial which began: “Leon Trotzky died at the hands of one of that small gang of dubious social elements and provocateurs who alone remained for him to lead after he had long been exposed as an enemy of the working class.” The rest of the editorial was in this vein, an inchoate mass of garbled facts, rumors, slanders and abuse from the gutter. And the masses in Soviet Russia learned of Trotsky’s death from a notice exactly seven lines long in the official press.
 



For some time now I have felt that those of us who write in Labor Action have tended to dwell too much on the negative aspects of the war that is now ending. We have proved quite conclusively, I think, that both sides are fighting for ends which have nothing to do with the interests of the masses on either side, for ends, in fact, which directly conflict with those interests. We have exposed the hypocrisy of the democracies’ war aims and have shown how the New Deal has been trying to get this country into war to protect the imperialist interests of Wall Street and the Sixty Families.
This is all true, and important. But more and more, as Hitler’s victory becomes more complete, people brush such arguments aside with: “Isn’t Roosevelt’s regime at least better for the masses than Hitler’s? And so why not support Roosevelt as the lesser evil?” There are many things that can be said in reply to this – and I think we must say them more than we have been. They all boil down to the fact that capitalist democracy will not be able to put up any more effective fight against Hitlerism over here than it did in the continent of Europe. Hence, the choice for the American bourgeoisie is: fascism or defeat; and the choice for the American working class is, by the same token, socialism or defeat.
This week I want to sketch out merely one aspect of the matter: the superior economic efficiency of fascism over democratic capitalism when it comes to organizing a national economy for a war effort. This efficiency I believe is based on a temporary and forced suppression of the class struggle, partly by ruthless and brutal smashing of all working class organizations but also partly by an over-riding of private capitalist property interests in the interests of national production. It is this second aspect of fascism – its exploitation, in however horribly perverted a way, of certain features of the planned, collectivized economy of socialism – that I want to discuss here.
 
Why Hitler Won
The German army crossed the border of Holland on May 10. Five weeks later, Holland and Belgium were completely occupied, the Maginot Line was shattered, the French Army was in full retreat, and France was suing for peace. Today France is a fascist state and practically an ally of Germany, and England faces the most serious threat of invasion since the Norman Conquest nine hundred years ago.
What lesson can we draw from this amazing military victory, without a parallel in world history for scope and speed? The most obvious fact is that all the defeated nations had the same kind of governmental and economic systems, and that this system, which we may call “democratic capitalism”, is the same kind of system we have in the United States today.
For the reason that Nazi Germany is winning the war is that it is a more efficient way of organizing national production than democratic capitalism. And it is more efficient because it has adopted, economically at least, something which resembles – in a perverted, incomplete way – that planned, collectivized economy which is a feature of socialism.
There is one point that must be made absolutely clear, and that is that, whereas socialism is a method of organizing national production for normal peacetime ends – and hence means a great rise in mass living standards – fascism, on the contrary, is nothing more and nothing less than a war economy, whose only aim is the organization of the economy for waging war. It should also be emphasized that Hitler’s fascism represents not a revolutionary break with capitalism, but on the contrary is simply the ultimate extension of the very same tendencies towards state control which we have seen since the war in the capitalist democracies. These tendencies, of course, have been carried to an unprecedented extreme under fascism.
Some writers, in fact, have called fascism by the term: “black socialism”. What do they mean? Simply that fascism is socialism turned inside out, a “socialism” whose aim is war and destruction, a “socialism” which has been perverted by big business to the enslavement of the masses – in a word, a “socialism” which bears about the same resemblance to the real thing as the “democracy” Roosevelt and Willkie talk about so much these days bears to the democracy of Jefferson and Tom Paine.
Hitlerism has only one thing in common with socialism, but that is what has made his system so powerful in war: a collective control, by the state, over the whole national economic machine – including private property interests – which is unprecedented in past history. And it is precisely this distant echo of real socialist economics, it is just this which has made Hitler’s war machine so powerful. Socialism is production for use, fascism is production for war only. But Hitler’s victory is a convincing proof of the superior efficiency of socialism to the democratic capitalist system we now have in America.
 
Big Business Efficiency
United Slates the most advanced capitalist country on earth. Every one knows that a corporation like U.S. Steel or General Electric is economically more efficient than the dozens of smaller companies they replace. Why? Because instead of many conflicting policies, you have one centrally directed policy, because instead of much duplication of plants and facilities, you have a few huge plants big enough to afford the most advanced technology and to plan work on a mass production basis, because, in short, within the corporate limits of General Electric, at least, you have a planned economy. This is what has happened in Nazi Germany, with the Nazi bureaucracy playing the part of the directors of General Electric. A huge state-controlled super-corporation has been set up, which includes all the banks and factories and farms of the nation, organized so that each of them is related to the others for the maximum national production for war purposes. (There is evidence that fascism increases productivity, in man-and controls production in the interest of waging war.) Take the matter of oil for the tanks and planes that have won the war for the Nazis. Germany has no oil fields. It is possible to make synthetic gasoline from coal, but the process is too costly to be profitable. In this country, under these conditions, we would either have no oil – or import it. But in Germany, the Nazi bureaucracy has seen to it that the expensive plants for making gasoline, out of coal have been built in the last few years, partly by State subsidies, partly by forcing business men to invest their surplus earnings in such plants. So too with the iron ore shortage. Germany has large deposits of low-grade iron ore. When private business men refused to build plants to process this ore, on the grounds it would not be “profitable”, the Nazis set up the Herman Goering Iron Works and are now working these deposits on a big scale. So too with artificial “buna” rubber, and a dozen other commodities.
 
Not Socialism, Not Free Capitalism
Now this is not socialism, by any possible test of that much-abused term. But it is not the kind of capitalism we know in America, either. As the bourgeois writer, Gustav Stolper, puts it in his new book, German Economy, 1870–1940, in a totalitarian system, it is not the market but
“it is the Government that decides for what purpose, to what extent and by what methods the human and material resources of the nation are to be employed, and the Government is not motivated by considerations of profit, but usually by considerations of a non-economic nature.”
In Germany’s case, these considerations were to win the war. But whatever the end, the fact is that such barriers of capitalism as we know it over here (it is highly significant that for years bourgeois economists have been predicting the imminent economic collapse of Nazi Germany) to make a fuller use of national resources for war than is possible under capitalist democracy. To quote Stolper again:
“When a government has complete control over the man power and the material resources of a country, the only limit to the expansion of production is precisely this man power and these natural resources.”
 
Let’s Have the Real Thing!
No, it’s not socialism, not even economically. But it makes use of the sort of planned centralized, collective economy which a workers’ socialist government would put into effect. And if Hitler can do what he has done with this mere shadow of a real collective economy, then why wouldn’t the real thing be overwhelmingly superior to our present form of chaotic “democratic” capitalism – and, what is more, to Hitlerism as well?
 



The Twenty-Third Congressional District, where Max Shachtman, candidate of the Workers Party, is running for Congress, embraces a large part of New York City. It includes about two-thirds of the Bronx by area and more than that by population: all of the “West Bronx”, the white collar and middle class districts over towards the Hudson, spreading out on both sides of the Grand Concourse; and most of the “East Bronx”, a vast area, bisected by Southern Boulevard, whose residents are mostly working men and women.
Both the Bronxes, East and West, are residential districts, with no important factory areas. The tens of thousands of workers in the East Bronx commute to their jobs by subway, going downtown or out to Brooklyn to work in garment factories, bakeries, printing plants, and so on. The Bronx is heavily Jewish in population, and in the East Bronx there is a sizable Negro section.
*
The Free Press is a wonderful institution, one of the pillars of our great American democracy, etc., etc. But what is it “free” to? Certainly not to the Workers Party. Last week we sent out a news release stating that over 7,000 residents of the Bronx had petitioned the Board of Elections to put Shachtman on the ballot, and that the Board had acted favorably on the petition. One might have thought that any action by seven thousand people was news, and that the appearance on a national ballot of a revolutionary anti-war candidate at this time was news – if only for its rarity value. Worth four lines at the foot of a column somewhere, or a paragraph in the Political Notes department. The release was sent out to all the daily papers and to about thirty other papers and magazines. How many will use it remains to be seen. But one thing has definitely been established: the daily papers don’t consider it news. Careful reading of the papers for the four days following the release fails to reveal a single reference to it. Even the BRONX HOME NEWS, a daily paper with a large circulation exclusively in the Bronx, has so far printed not a line about Shachtman’s campaign.
*
The Congressional election in the Twenty-Third District is a mysterious affair in some ways. The candidates, are: for the Democrats, Charles A. Buckley, now in Congress; for the Republicans, Lowell H. Browne; for the American Labor Party, Jack Altman, the ex-Socialist, now a New Deal patriot; for the Communist Party, the veteran Stalinist hack, I. Begun; and, for the Workers Party, Max Shachtman. But, except for the last-named, none of these gentlemen seems to have so far made any decided effort to make himself known to the people of the Bronx. I am told that Shachtman has made more speeches to date in the district than all the other candidates put together.
*
The only outward signs of the political struggle presumably taking place in the Twenty-Third Congressional District were the red, white and blue signs outside the various campaign headquarters. The Jackson Democratic Club at 1301 Boston Road had a huge sign out, with Roosevelt in large letters and Buckley in small ones. (The clubhouse was closed.) I dropped into two American Labor Party campaign headquarters, looking for some trace of Comrade Jack Altman At one place, on Southern Boulevard, they told me that no Altman campaign literature had yet been printed, but that some would be ready “next week”.
“All we have now is about Roosevelt,” they said, pointing to a table loaded with pamphlets and posters. They seemed to regard me with some suspicion, obviously puzzled why any one should take such a keen interest in Altman’s candidacy. At the ALP clubhouse at 1400 Boston Road, not only was there no Altman literature, but no one there seemed to place the name.
*
But the great mystery of the Congressional campaign is: who is the Republican candidate? The BRONX HOME NEWS doesn’t tell, there are no references to him even in the few store windows that display Willkie portraits. There is a rumor that his name is Browne, which I was able to verily by a call to Republican Bronx headquarters. (The person who answered the phone didn’t know his name and had to ask around to get it.) Bat nothing more is known of him. The reason for this obscurity, of course, is that in the Bronx, Boss Flynn’s Democratic machine is so all-powerful that the Republicans exist there only on sufferance, as a sort of His Majesty’s Loyal Opposition. The Republican boss in the Bronx, in fact, is actually dependent on Flynn for the $6,000 a year courthouse job he lives on. Flynn gave it to him and Flynn can take it away any time he likes. So not much is heard of the Republican Party in the Twenty-Third Congressional District.
 



THE 1940 PRESIDENTIAL campaign has taken place in the midst of the supreme historical crisis of world capitalism, an era of upheaval unprecedented since Napoleonic times. Since the campaign began, Germany has established its political and military control of the European continent, the British Empire has entered into a life-and-death struggle with the axis powers, Japan has joined the axis to establish a new “world order”, warning the United States that any direct participation in the war in either the Atlantic or the Pacific will mean war in both oceans. These events have stimulated the Roosevelt Administration to bold countermoves which are changing the face of American politics.
The internal development of capitalist democracy, under the tremendous pressure of the overseas crisis, has greatly speeded up in the last few months. Economically, the drift towards state capitalism proceeds faster than ever. Unemployment is still around ten millions, private investment has failed to pick up appreciably even under the stimulus of war orders, bank reserves are as swollen as ever with no profitable outlet, and the rearmament program, despite the combined efforts of the Democrats and the Republicans, is automatically still further extending the control of the State over private business. Politically, parliamentary democracy has received severe blows: the President’s consummation of the destroyer deal with Britain without consulting Congress; the swift passage, under ruling class pressure, of the peacetime conscription legislation in the face of widespread popular opposition; the current breakdown, through Congress’s inability to harmonize the sharp conflicts of class and property interests, of the rearmament program. And, above all, the nature of the presidential campaign itself.
For, in the face of these great developments, both inside and outside the country, we see a campaign in which there are no issues! This is the great dumdee campaign in American history, the campaign in which the electorate are offered a choice between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The meaninglessness of bourgeois democracy in a period like this never came out more unmistakably. There are no issues not because the country is united behind the policies of the Roosevelt Administration – a large section of the population is anti-war and anti-conscription – but because the ruling class is united and because the crisis is much too severe to permit the luxury of a democratic discussion of the issues. Roosevelt and Willkie, the only candidates with a chance of election, stand shoulder to shoulder on all the important issues because the bourgeois interests which use them indifferently as mouthpieces are similarly indivisible today.
Boss Flynn’s Campaign
One of the reasons for the unreality of the campaign is that one of the contestants, Roosevelt, has refused to campaign. With a cynicism which contrasts ironically with his fervent speeches about “democracy”, Roosevelt has refused to carry out the minimum responsibility of a candidate seeking election: to present his view of the issues to the voters. He has taken full advantage of his position as President to identify his official acts with his candidacy, to make Willkie’s criticisms seem to be traitorous attacks on the Presidents office, even to raid the political camp of his opponent for his secretaries of navy and war. By any possible interpretation of democratic procedure, Willkie’s demand that Roosevelt debate him was a reasonable one. (Though Ickes scored shrewdly when he suggested instead a debate between Willkie and his running mate, McNary, on the grounds that Willkie had more basic differences with McNary than with Roosevelt.) But Roosevelt to date has refused even to recognize publicly the existence of an opposition candidate. The points raised by Willkie day by day are answered, not by Roosevelt, but by the obscure political hack. Boss Flynn of the Bronx.
If Roosevelt has felt it beneath his dignity to campaign, his opponent has done enough talking and travelling for both of them. Willkie has talked himself hoarse without saying anything in particular. The one issue he has been able to dig up is – the Third Term! For the rest, his speeches have been full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
A cursory review of Willkie’s speeches reveals that he is definitely FOR the following (1) democracy; (2) profits; (3) national defense; (4) business (“There are, including farmers, over 10,000,000 private businesses in the United States.”); (5) more aid for the farmers; (6) more aid for labor; (7) more aid for business; (8) more aid for all other groups and subdivisions of the population not included under the three aforementioned heads; (9) common sense; (10) Roosevelt’s foreign policy; (11) Roosevelt’s domestic policy (except it should be more efficient); (12) prosperity; (13) peace (unless it is necessary to go to war); (14) the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and Abraham Lincoln. On the other hand, Willkie has taken a firm stand AGAINST the following: (1) red tape; (2) inefficiency; (3) high taxes on business; (4) Hitler; (5) an un-balanced budget; (6) unemployment (his remedy: more jobs); (7) the Roosevelt Administration (except for its foreign and domestic policies).
Sometimes Willkie’s speeches sound like echoes of the Hoover-Landon campaigns – the hopeless, moth-eaten, unreal laissez-faire philosophy of “no governmental interference with business” (as though the very survival of business today were not dependent on governmental “interference!”), “a balanced budget”, “lower taxes”, “encourage private industry”, etc., etc. But there is also a new and completely contradictory note: unlike Hoover and Landon, Willkie has put himself on record as favoring the retention of almost all the New Deal social reforms and of its whole program of business regulation, including the SEC and TVA. Apparently, he wants to have his cake and eat it too, as in the following crude attempt to combine both philosophies: “It is my belief that private industry can be so stimulated by encouragement, by the government, that the flow of capital through adoption of new tax laws will reduce the present unemployment to an insignificant amount. I don’t think then there would be any need to abandon any of the social legislation, the minimum wage law or the social security.”
The suggestion that, after the election, Roosevelt will offer a cabinet post to Willkie may not be so fantastic. He would certainly fit in better than either Knox or Stimson. This would be the final turn of the screw in the disintegration of American parliamentary democracy.
There are two major groups of issues in the campaign, on both of which the two chief candidates are in complete agreement. These are: (1) foreign policy – the attitude of the United States towards the rise of Germany and the decline of the British Empire; (2) domestic policy: the devolution of bourgeois democracy into Bonapartism through extension of the executive power and the undermining of the authority of Congress. The two are, of course, closely connected, the bourgeoisie finding that, because of the terrible speed and pressure of the crisis, it can protect its interests only by short-circuiting the processes of democracy. Hence Willkie, agreeing on foreign policy, has been unable to capitalize politically on the domestic issues. Let us look in more detail at how these issues have been sidestepped in the Roosevelt-Willkie campaign.
 
Willkie, The Blitzkrieg Baby
More than once during the campaign, some of the old-line Republican chieftains have tried to get Willkie to make at least a gesture, however demagogic, of opposition to the more extreme pro-war acts of the Roosevelt Administration. They saw a large body of isolationist votes without any candidate to turn to, and they wanted to harvest them. But Willkie has refused to concede an inch to such counsels, tor he well knew why he was nominated and what the big bourgeoisie – of which he is personally a member as well as a mouthpiece – requires of him.
Willkie got the Republican nomination partly because he had some of the political “it” which Roosevelt has, partly because he aroused a real crusading enthusiasm among stockbrokers and Park Avenue matrons (“the Bryan of the rich”, in Alice Longworth’s phrase), but chiefly because Hitler was winning his Blitzkrieg against France and Belgium in appallingly little time. All through the winter, when the war was in its “quiet” stage, the leading contenders for the Republican nomination played, like their party in general, a demagogic “anti-war” game designed to make political capital out of the powerful isolationist sentiment of the masses. Taft, Vandenburg, and, after considerable fence-sitting, Dewey – all took this line. As a principled and conscious Wall Streeter, however, Willkie had ,from the beginning lined up with Roosevelt on foreign policy. When the Blitzkrieg came, the business community suddenly realized that Roosevelt had been a far-sighted imperialist, and that the threat to American imperialism from the Nazi war machine had become the all-important issue. At the Republican convention, a curious conflict took place between the professional politicians who wanted a more stable and amenable candidate and who were also willing to play around with the war issue in order to keep as many isolationist votes as possible, and their big business backers, who insisted on putting the war issue first. The business forces won out and Willkie was nominated.
The same conflict – with the same results – has cropped up now and then in the campaign, between political bosses who want first of all to win the election, and Willkie, who wants first of all to save American imperialism. Heroically refusing to make “a political football” out of so sacred a matter, Willkie is losing the election for the same reason he won the nomination: because he supports in every detail the Roosevelt foreign policies. With a fidelity to principle worthy of a better cause, he has thrown issue after issue away. Despite the widespread unpopularity of peacetime conscription, he came out for it even before Roosevelt did. He refused to make even minor concessions: although 140 Republican Congressmen voted to delay the draft until an attempt had been made to raise enough men by voluntary enlistment, Willkie, “disregarding strong pressure from members of the Republican organization”, came out flatly for immediate conscription. He had no criticisms to make of the Administration’s South American commitments at the Havana Conference. He endorsed the most audacious strokes of Roosevelt foreign policy – the military alliance with Canada and the trade of destroyers for British naval bases. With the basic elements in Roosevelt’s defense policy – control by business men, “encouragement” of private industry through liberal amortization and war profits tax provisions – Willkie naturally had no quarrel. And even such a development as the Rome-Berlin-Tokio alignment against the United States has found Willkie with nothing much to say, despite the cautious efforts of Arthur Krock of the N. Y. Times to show him how he can find an “issue” there. Willkie can find no issue because the forward policy of the Roosevelt Administration in the Pacific is precisely the one which he, and his Wall Street friends, have long favored.
Thus on the crucial issues of war and conscription our “democratic” political system provides no channel for the expression of the opposition to the Roosevelt policies of a large section of the electorate. Among the farmers of the midwest, among the unemployed, among the industrial workers, among the Negroes there is a deep-rooted, inarticulate isolationist and anti-conscriptionist sentiment. The Negro press, ardently pro-New Deal in general, is the only section of the American press which is still predominantly isolationist. Both the CIO and AFL, as well as the Railroad Brotherhoods, have come out against peacetime conscription.
One ironical by-product of this situation is the remarkable staying-power of the Communist Party. At the time of the Soviet-Nazi Pact, it looked as though the C.P. had once for all committed suicide as a mass party. The effects of the Pact were serious, it is true, but it is now clear that the C.P. is far from through. They still control the American Youth Congress; they have a new peace “front”; the Daily Worker and New Masses still appear, and there is also Friday. Above all, the hold of the Stalinists on influencing CIO unions has not been broken. After the Pact, Lewis began a “purge” of the Stalinists, but his campaign stalled and is now abandoned. In fact, Lewis himself has more or less tied up with the Stalinists, and the CIO seems to be splitting in half on the C.P. issue, with the leadership of such important unions as the seamen, the longshoremen, the transport workers, the communications workers and the Newspaper Guild playing along with the party. Undoubtedly a major factor in this amazing survival of Stalinist influence on the American labor movement is the fact that the C.P. is the only mass party which (for whatever reasons!) speaks against war and conscription.
 
Taking ‘Politics’ Out Of Politics
When Congress spent a few days debating the question of peacetime conscription, the reaction of the press and of the Administration was that all this talk was “wasting time” and that “delaying action” – an attitude similar to Hitler’s when he speaks contemptuously of “parliamentary chatter-boxes”. For the fact is that when a modern capitalist enters into a crisis as sharp as the present one, the traditional practices of bourgeois democracy become luxuries which the ruling class cannot afford. The more clearsighted bourgeois politicians press to take politics out of politics, that is to make all issues administrative rather than political questions. The line of policy favored by those in control of the State is assumed to be generally agreed upon and the only question is how it can be most speedily and efficiently carried out. Roosevelt has pushed ahead in this Bonapartist direction as rapidly as he dared, as in his unsuccessful attempt early in the summer to get Congress to adjourn. In the campaign he has brushed aside Republican criticisms of the defense program as shabby attempts to “make politics out of national defense”.
The most striking example of this tendency was the famous destroyer deal with Britain. Two years ago the Ludlow Amendment was an important issue: should Congress have the power to declare war or should the people themselves, by referendum, exercise this vital power? The decay of American democracy may be gauged by the fact that today even Congress has become too uncontrolled and democratic an institution to be permitted to vote on such important matters as war or peace. The destroyer deal, which amounted to putting the country into the war on the side of England, was negotiated and consummated in strictest secrecy by Roosevelt and a small clique of Administration insiders. Not until they read the papers on September 4th, did the members of Congress know anything about it. For months Roosevelt had been negotiating the deal with the British authorities, but there was not time for even a week’s debate on it in Congress. (Since such a debate might have imperiled the whole affair – and American imperialism doesn’t play around with matters as important as this.) The gist of the lengthy legal opinion rendered by Roosevelt’s Attorney-General Jackson was that the trade was an “executive” matter and hence of no concern to Congress.
Here was an issue Willkie, as a crusader for “democracy”, might have been expected to seize upon. And indeed he did condemn the manner of making the deal (while approving the deal itself) as ... “regrettable”. A few days later he grew even bolder: the deal, he said, was “arbitrary and dictatorial”. But it was clear his heart was not in his work. He quickly dropped the issue. Speculating rather sadly on the poverty of issues which Willkie had been able to find in the campaign, the conservative columnist Arthur Krock of the N.Y. Times tried to suggest how Willkie could make the heavens ring with denunciations of Roosevelt’s high-handed and disingenuous tactics. “Should Mr. Willkie be able to do this,” he concluded, “and there is a favorable public response, he will have a major issue. But the accomplishment is difficult because Mr. Willkie is also a foe of isolation ...” Krock, however, did not mention the chief difficulty: that Mr. Willkie, as an exceptionally intelligent and conscious representative of the bourgeoisie, recognized clearly not only the dangers of isolationism but also of the usual democratic procedures.
 
“I’ll Do It Better”
... is the most inspiring campaign slogan Willkie has been able to create. The bankruptcy of the Republican Party is dramatically expressed in this belated revival of the old “put a business man in the White House” slogan which elected Hoover in 1928. A more efficient administration of the same basic policies – that is what Willkie’s campaign platform boils down to. It is not a very exciting slogan, and even here Willkie hasn’t got an issue, even here he has been unable to make political capital out of the glaring defects in the rearmament program undertaken by the Roosevelt Administration.
The target would seem to be wide as a barn door. More and more evidence is appearing that things are not going at all well with the “defense program”, that there is no coordinated centralized control, that the political appointees, Knox and Stimson, are incompetent to run the war and navy departments, that businessmen are delaying production for the Government until they extort better tax and amortization terms, and that, in the years in which Roosevelt was working up the war hysteria ever more openly, remarkably little progress was made in providing the munitions and ships and planes to fight a modern war.
“The armament program is making progress, but more slowly than was hoped and intended,” states the current National City Bank Letter in a section on Delays in the Armament Program. And Leonard P. Ayres, the well-known economist of the Cleveland Trust Co., has written a pamphlet, The Progress of Preparedness, in which he compares with 1917 the speed and efficiency of America’s current rearming, very much to the disadvantage of the latter.
A few sentences are worth quoting:
Our best guides for judging the progress of our present preparedness effort are still the records of what we did 23 years ago in the World War. Probably we ought not to be too much astonished or disheartened if we find that our rate of progress now is a good deal slower than it was then ...
There are two conclusions about which there has been general agreement among those who have testified about our military needs during recent months in the hearings before the House and Senate Committees on Military Affairs. The first is that at present we are utterly unprepared for modern warfare even on a small scale. Neither the Regular Army nor the National Guard has the tanks, scout cars, field artillery, anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft guns, or even the aviation equipment essential for taking part in the kind of fighting that has been going on in Europe this year ...
The other conclusion is that the creation of the industrial capacities for making munitions is in itself a long and slow process ... It did not take us anything like as long in 1917 and 1918 to make munitions as it seems to take now ... If it would have taken us two and a half years to create a condition or self-sustaining military preparedness at the rate at which we were moving in 1917 and 1918, how long will it take us at the rate at which we are moving now? However that question may be answered, there is another one behind it which asks whether we are likely to be allowed that much time.
Here, then, is a wide-open issue – and yet one which, on closer inspection, the astute Roosevelt has also managed to shut tight in Willkie’s face. For one thing, when Willkie attacks Roosevelt for “hostility” to business and claims that only a “business man’s” administration of the arms program will get results, his attack draws little blood. For both the war and navy departments are in the hands of the respectably conservative Republicans, Knox and Stimson, while the executives in charge of the armament program are such eminent businessmen as Forrestal of Dillon, Read; Knudsen of General Motors; Nelson of Sears, Roebuck; and Stettinius of U.S. Steel. To Willkie’s charges Roosevelt, via Flynn, retorts in effect: Who would you put in any better? Perhaps you would replace Stettinius of U.S. Steel by Fairless of U.S. Steel? Or substitute Sloan of General Motors for Knudsen of General Motors? Or, indeed, not Flynn or Roosevelt but the businessmen themselves often supply the answer to Willkie, so that we have the absurd spectacle of Knudsen and Stettinius, in defending their administration of the defense program, indirectly defending Roosevelt’s policies against the criticisms of their fellow Wall Streeter, Wendell Willkie.
Even more embarrassing to Willkie, in his efforts to make “national defense” a campaign issue, is the obvious fact that the main outlines of Roosevelt’s policy are entirely agreeable to the business community. As it is finally emerging from Congress, the legislation on amortization allowances of war-materials plants and on wartime profits and taxation is extremely “liberal”, in the businessman’s phrase. Furthermore, much of the delay and confusion in getting the arms program started is due to the refusal of private business to accept war orders until they get the kind of terms they wanted. There is no “issue” for Willkie there. Willkie did make one attempt to pick a quarrel in this sphere, when he objected to the proposal, endorsed by Roosevelt, to give the President power to condemn and seize plants and industries which refused to cooperate on war orders. But since this power had existed in 1917 as well, Willkie’s objections had little effect, and his advisers later had to admit he had made a tactical error.
It is typical of the political impasse in which Willkie finds himself that, after Congress had passed the legislation giving the President wartime powers to “conscript” industry, the all-important rules of procedure under which this power may be exercised were formulated not by Roosevelt, not by Hopkins or Ickes or Corcoran or Cohen but by a member of the Defense Commission named Donald M. Nelson, who is on leave of absence from a top executive post in Sears, Roebuck & Co. How can a hardworking “business candidate” make any headway when his opponent does things like that?
 
The “Appeasement” Issue
We have seen that Willkie is losing the campaign because he can find no issues, and that he can find no issues because Roosevelt is pursuing a policy both in foreign affairs and in “national defense” which is acceptable to the American ruling class and hence which is identical with the policy Willkie himself would follow if he replaced Roosevelt. Does this mean there is, then, no difference between the two presidential candidates?
There is a difference, but it is not in the candidates nor in their campaign issues, but rather in the social forces behind each of them. Even more than in 1936, this election is splitting along class lines. (An interesting sign, by the way, of the ripening of the social crisis of our capitalism.) Willkie seems to have even less trade union support than Landon had, nor did the working class show its hostility to Landon in any such dramatic form as it did towards Willkie in Detroit, Pontiac, Flint and the Chicago packinghouse district. The press is even more solidly behind Willkie than it was behind Landon. The N.Y. Times has forsaken its traditional Democratic allegiance for the first time in its history to support Willkie. A recent survey by Time showed that, out of 120 of the largest dailies in the country, 78 were for Willkie, with 13 “undecided” and only 9 for Roosevelt.
Since in this country as in France and England, there are strong “appeasement” currents within the ruling class, it is not surprising to find Willkie, despite his foreign policy, getting the support of the appeasers. Henry Ford is for Willkie and is reported to have had a mysterious and highly secret interview with him on campaign matters. Hoover, of course, is in Willkie’s camp, nor has Willkie dared to repudiate Hoover’s frankly pro-appeasement speeches. And there are even more embarrassing supporters. Willkie repudiated Father Coughlin’s endorsement, but his gesture did not dispose of the awkward question why did Coughlin prefer Willkie to Roosevelt? According to the N.Y. Times of August 28, the Bund organs, The Free American and Deutsche Weckruf und Beobachter, has been urging its readers to elect Willkie. (The Times, which is especially sensitive on the score of Willkie’s appeasement following, buried the item on page 14.) When Wallace labelled the Republicans the party of appeasement, he was not too far wrong.
In one sense, this is all slightly academic at the moment, since there seems to be very little chance of Willkie winning the election. But the appeasement issue will not die even if Roosevelt is reelected. For Roosevelt, though somewhat more independent than they would like, has never resisted the wishes of the business community on any vital issue. And there is already some evidence that these wishes may begin to shift their direction soon after the election. The ultimate joke of this campaign may turn out to be that the foreign policy which both parties united to endorse may need to be changed almost as soon as the votes are counted. The open threat of the Rome-Berlin-Tokio axis to engage the United States on two ocean fronts together with the mounting evidence that the nation’s war machine will not be ready for a modern war for at least two and a half years more – these developments may well set up a strong appeasement tide in business circles. The mechanics of it are peculiar: up to a certain point, the worse the situation of the “democracies” and the more threatening the gains of the totalitarian states, the more imperative it seems to American imperialists to get into the fight. But once England’s position appears so unfavorable as to be almost hopeless while the “have-nots” close ranks on a world scale against their American rival – then those business interests which have been shouting loudest tor intervention and war may “suddenly discover the advantages of temporarily accepting as a fait accompli the new world order – trading with the Nazis on a “sensible, businesslike” basis and hoping to gain time to build up their own war machine with a view to a future settling of accounts.
Even if England holds out all winter, such a shift in ruling class sentiment is quite possible. If England goes under, however, and Hitler definitely wins the war in Europe, then there seems no question at all in which direction this sentiment will shift. The September issue of Fortune contained the results of a poll conducted among 15,000 executives of large corporations. Three of its findings are of special interest here: (1) 88 thought Willkie would handle foreign policy better than Roosevelt, (2) only 2.6% were “definitely opposed” to trading with a Hitlerized economic bloc in post-war Europe; (3) less than half favored a policy directed towards the expansion of foreign trade, while almost a third favored “U.S. contraction towards self-sufficiency”. Thus these big business leaders, almost all of them for Willkie, are for doing business with Hitler if he wins (which of course would only be possible with an appeasement policy) and a large minority of them are for an isolationist economic policy, which would also lead to an appeasement perspective. Fortune’s definition of “the foreign policy of American business” is quite accurate: “economic opportunism”.
As for how Roosevelt would be likely to react if the business community began to press for an appeasement policy, one answer was given at a meeting held a few weeks ago in Washington. Some fifty bankers, economists and New Dealers discussed the question: how to finance “national defense”? There was some technical disagreement as to whether inflation (favored by the New Dealers) or deflation (favored by the bankers) was the preferable course, but when Lawrence Dennis, the quasi-fascist economist, made some cynical remarks about the New Deal “using defense as a WPA program of which the Republicans have to approve”, the atmosphere became heated. The heat came from both the bankers and the New Dealers. Jerome Frank, head of the S.E.C., retorted to Mr. Dennis: “You don’t like capitalism ... You think it is bound to fail and you want to see it fail, and you hate to see a program that will work and preserve capitalism. I think this program is going to preserve capitalism. I think the investment bankers are going to get business out of it.” After Mr. Frank, arose Mr. Benjamin Buttenweiser, a partner in the great Wall Street firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co.: “We may quarrel with some of the methods and some of the views of the present administration, but the charge was made that the New Dealers are against capitalism, and that is completely unwarranted. If that is so, I don’t know the meaning of capitalism.”
We may take it for granted both that Mr. Buttenweiser knows quite well the meaning of capitalism, and that he and his colleagues in Wall Street have also acquired by now a fairly accurate knowledge of the nature of the New Deal. If Hitler wins this winter, the rest of the American people will rapidly acquire the same knowledge.
DWIGHT MACDONALD
 



Last Friday, May 24, the America First Committee held a mass meeting in New York City’s Madison Square Garden. The chief speakers were Charles A. Lindbergh, Senator Burton K. Wheeler, and Norman Thomas. It was by far the biggest and most enthusiastic isolationist rally New York has yet seen. Inside the Garden there was a capacity crowd of 22,000, with another 14,000 milling around outside – a big increase since Lindbergh’s last New York meeting, just one month earlier, for which only about 10,000 turned out.
By now the America First Committee is far and away the dominant isolationist outfit in the country. The considerably older (founded 1938) Keep America Out of War Committee, a Socialist Party-liberal-pacifist group which is holding its annual convention in Washington in a few days, has been far outdistanced in both size and publicity by its younger (and more conservative) competitor. The flash-in-the-pan No Foreign War Committee, launched early this year with a big burst of expensive publicity by the smalltown Iowa editor, Verne Marshall, has by now fizzled out completely. Its death was hastened by Marshall’s blunders and by the revelation of the source of its copious funds: the sinister international oil operator, William Rhodes Davis, whose “connections” with the Nazis have long been of the very best.
Lindbergh has become the chief mouthpiece for America First? But who is behind the Committee – and behind Lindbergh? What is its history? What sort of support does it have? Where is it going politically. These questions I shall try to answer.
 
Birthplace: Yale University
America First look definite shape only last fall, as the presidential campaign was going into its last weeks. But its origins can be traced back to the spring of 1940 and the elm-shaded campus of Yale, the chief figure in its founding was R. DOUGLAS STUART, JR., then a Yale senior, whose father is the first vice-president of the Quaker Oats Co. Young Stuart (who now edits the near-fascist magazine. Scribner’s Commentator) soon made contact with financial backing.
One of the men was CHESTER BOWLES, JR., head of Benton & Bowles, a big Manhattan advertising agency. His agency was useful in preparing the early publicity and ads of the Committee. The “Benton” of Benton & Bowles, incidentally, is now vice-president of the University of Chicago, whose president, Robert E. Hutchins. is also a leading collaborator of the America First Committee.
The second – and more important – adviser of young Stewart was WILLIAM R. CASTLE, JR., a wealthy Harvard man whose family owns large Hawaiian sugar interests. Castle had a long career in the U.S. State Department, ending up as Hoover’s Under-Secretary of State. He is said to be ambitious to get back into politics and has been termed by observers “definitely the brains of the America First Committee.” He denies the oft-repeated story that he writes Lindbergh’s speeches, but he is at least a very intimate friend of Lindbergh. His political views are extreme right-wing Republican, with a touch of anti-Semitism. He is reported to be privately “convinced that Hitler has won the war.”
 
Big Business and America First
With such parents, it is not surprising that America First should have accumulated quite a load of big business supporters on its National Committee as it began to get under way last fail.
One of the first converts was HENRY FORD, whose relationship to the Committee is peculiar enough to deserve a paragraph here. On September 21 he was announced as a member of the National Committee. Three months later, however, he resigned this post under mysterious circumstances. It is not definitely known whether he chose to do so for personal reasons or whether, as the Committee began to build a mass following, its directors felt that Ford, with his Nazi medals, his fascistic labor policies and his well known anti-Semitic views, was more of a debit than an asset. He is still a rank-and-file member, however. Furthermore, according to a sensational story in PM for February 9 last:
“In a locked and guarded room on the sixth floor of the Ford Building, 1710 Broadway, Henry Ford has compiled a master list of appeasers with the names and addresses of thousands of anti-Semites, pro-Nazis and fascists. It was done with the cooperation of Scribner’s Commentator, bible of America’s super-appeasers.”
Other big business names on America First’s National Committee are; GEN. ROBERT E. WOOD, national chairman, who heads the great Chicago mail-order house of Sears, Roebuck; STERLING MORTON, of the wealthy Morton salt family; THOMAS N. McCARTER, founder and longtime head of the powerful Public Service Company of New Jersey; EDWARD RICKENBACKER, president of Eastern Air Lines; EDWARD L. RYERSON, JR., of the Ryerson Steel family, vice-chairman oi the Inland Steel Co.; JAY C. HORMEL, the meat packer (“Spam”), who got the topflight Manhattan advertising firm of Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborne to contribute its technical services free to the Committee. (It is also reported that Stuart uses the Quaker Oats publicity staff and General Wood the Sears, Roebuck publicity department to work on America First propaganda.)
 
The Left Wing Forms
Since the line is exclusively concerned with keeping America out of the war, without any commitment as to either the political reasons for this or the kind of a social system a peaceful, “independent” America should build, the America First Committee has attracted a richly variegated following. At its meetings, both in the audience and on the platform. Coughlinites mingle with Norman Thomas socialists. Midwest progressives with Wall Street brokers. There are signs of late that tension is increasing, however, between its liberal and its fascist wings – with the business men playing a more or less centrist role. This tension is perhaps mostly caused by the fact that, of late, the Committee has ambitiously tried to strike out simultaneously both to the left and to the right to gain more recruits.
The leader of the liberal wing in the Committee is the energetic JOHN T. FLYNN, one of the founders of the Keep America Out of War Committee, who is chairman of the New York section of America First. Flynn, for years a New Republic columnist, is an old-fashioned trust-busting liberal, ever on the alert to protect free competition and the little business man against “Wall Street.” His chief leftwing colleague on the National Committee is KATHRYN LEWIS. Stalinoid daughter of John L.
First has been working more and more closely with the Socialist Party. The New Leader of May 24 reported that the SP and America First are exchanging membership lists. Last week in Chicago, MAYNARD KREUGER, Thomas’s 1940 presidential running mate, spoke at an America First chapter meeting. And, of course, the appearance of NORMAN THOMAS last Friday for the first time on an America First platform, is highly significant. Typical of the Committee’s scrambled politics was the conjunction on the platform of Thomas and the arch-conservative lady novelist, KATHLEEN NORRIS.)
 
“Nazi Transmission Belt”?
America First has also been philandering on the extreme right with various outright anti-Semitic and semi-fascistic characters. The Friends of Democracy charge that America First, indeed, is nothing less than a “Nazi transmission belt.” This has been mostly a matter of native fascists turning out for America First meetings uninvited, and giving (also uninvited) plugs for the Committee in their papers. The German-American National Alliance, successor to the Bund, in its official paper has solicited contributions to America First; Father Coughlin’s Social Justice is hawked vigorously at America First meetings; from Berlin itself have come broadcasts embarrassingly sympathetic to Lindbergh and Wheeler. It is true that this kind of support is not only unsought by the Committee, but also generally unwelcome. It seems exaggerating to sense as the various “innocent front” organizations of the Popular Front period were for the Stalinists. But it is also true that the line of America First, exclusively concerned with keeping American war aid from England and silent on all domestic political issues, is one which native fascists can easily support almost 100 per cent.
There have also been recent instances of the Committee’s officially collaborating with fascistic elements. According to The New Leader of May 17. “The America First Committee is taking over workers dismissed from Verne Marshall’s No Foreign War Committee ...” Two weeks ago, the REV. EDWARD LODGE CURRAN, editor of the pro-fascist Brooklyn Catholic sheet, The Tablet, and generally considered eastern spokesman for Father Coughlin, delivered the invocation at a big America First rally in Brooklyn. At this meeting – whose chief speaker was EX-GOVERNOR PHILIP LaFOLLETTE of Wisconsin, whose political career has shown certain totalitarian tendencies – prominent among those present was JOHN F. CASS1DY, Brooklyn leader at the Christian Front.
 
The Future
Friction seems to be developing between the liberals and the fascists in the Committee. Flynn is reported to be up in arms about the Brooklyn meeting addressed by the Rev. Mr. Curran. At Friday’s meeting, Flynn, who presided, dramatically denounced from the platform JOE McWILLIAMS, former Yorkville fuehrer and now leader of a lunatic-fringe fascist group called the American Destiny Party. McWilliams was sitting, as usual, in a front row seat at the rally. Most of the audience, papers reported, seemed to be sympathetic with Flynn’s attack. There is said to be a big fight brewing between Flynn and Curran, each of whom wants to purge the other.
Regardless of the outcome of the fight, it seems likely that the political complexion of the Committee’s following will not change much. Its isolationist line is one skillfully calculated to draw together all shades of bourgeois political opinion. So long as America First continues to avoid raising any domestic social or political issues, it will get the support both of the bourgeois isolationists, from Norman Thomas to Jay C. Hormel, and also the native fascists. It seems not unreasonable to predict that its positive political program, when the time comes to make it public, will be more along the lines desired by Messrs. Hormel, Wood, Ford and the other big-money backers of the Committee than along those of Messrs. Flynn and Thomas. One thing is notable about America First, that it seems to have very little trade union following, despite the widespread anti-war sentiment of the American working class. In such matters the workers often have a sure instinct.

(We will return to the motive behind America First in a coming issue of Labor Action. – Ed.)
 



This is a struggle of “the American people” against Nazi autocracy, says President Roosevelt. Now you would expect a “people’s war” to be run by the people. But if you examine at all closely the list of the several hundred officials who are now in Washington directing the “defense” program, you will find that the closest “the people” come to being represented is in the person of Sidney Hiilman. jingoistic trade union bureaucrat – and that even Hillman has little real power and is there largely for window-dressing. Of his four chief aides, not one is from the ranks of organized labor; two – Lubin and Cooke – are New Deal officials, and the other two – Bransome and Dooley – -are top executives respectively of those great labor organizations, thi: Vanadium Corporation and the Socony-Vacuum Oil Corporation.)
The impression you get from scanning the rosier of “national defense” chiefs is that this is to be a war to make the world safe for – corporation presidents.
 
The Big Four of the “OPM”
In the recent reorganization of the war program, supreme authority went to a board of four men, known as the Office for Production Management (”OPM”): William S. Knudsen, production chief; Sidney Hillman, labor chief; Secretary of War Stimson; and Secretary of the Navy Knox. Hillman need not detain us longer: his background as “labor statesman” is well known and I have already indicated the decorative nature of his role. Let us begin our Who’s Who with his colleagues.
1. WILLIAM S. KNUDSEN, Roosevelt’s No. 1 straw boss in the whole “defense” organization, worked for Henry Ford from 1911 to 1922, most of the time as Ford’s production manager. (Then as now Ford had the toughest, most brutally efficient labor policy in the industry.) In 1922 he went over to General Motors, becoming president of the company several years ago. At the time of the 1937 sit-down strikes, Knudsen made his attitude towards labor well known. His responsibilities as No. 1 Champion of Democracy don’t seem to have changed his ideas any. When Attorney General Jackson last fall ruled “informally” that defense contracts could not go to companies which violated the Wagner Act (later he backed down), Knudsen exploded: “That’s going too far! The Defense Commission has not the authority and does not want to undertake the job of enforcing the labor laws.”
And to a recent interviewer (N.Y. Times, Nov. 3, 1940) Knudsen expounded his philosophy:
“Human nature doesn’t change. I’ve never run across a bum who didn’t blame his condition on the system or the times. If a young chap has energy and curiosity and a pair of good legs and a good stomach, I’m willing to bet he’ll get on. He’ll get on irrespective of time, system or anything else – that is, provided he is willing to mind his own business. It’s not hard to guess that Knudsen wouldn’t consider trade union activity a young man’s “own business.”
2. HENRY L. STIMSON, the man Roosevelt picked for Secretary of War last summer, is a 73-year-old Republican “elder statesman.” He was Secretary of War under Taft and Secretary of State under Hoover (where his many boners won him the nickname of “Wrong Horse Harry”). The profound gulf that yawns between the policies of the Democratic Party (the party of the “people,” of the “little man”) and the Republican Party (the parly of wealth, privilege and economic royalism) is well shown in the comment of the N.Y. Times (Dec. 23. 1940) on Stimson’s regime, under Hoover, in the State Dept.: “Students of foreign policy have noted a continuity between his policies and those of his succe’ssor, Cordell -Hull, and his political antagonists of the Democratic Administration often called him in to get the benefit of his experience during the early years of the Roosevelt regime.” The “national defense” program is now getting the full benefit of Slimson’s half century of experience as a corporation lawyer and a rock-ribbed Republican wheelhorse.
3. COLONEL FRANK KNOX, who became Roosevelt’s Secretary of the Navy last summer, is also a lifelong Republican. He was general manager of the Hearst newspapers from 1927 to 1931, When he resigned to take over the Chicago Daily News. During the more “radical” period of the Roosevelt Administration, the News was a violently anti-New Deal paper. In the 1936 presidential campaign, Knox was London’s running mate.
 
”OPM”: Division of Production
4. JOHN D. BIGGERS is chief of the Production Division of the OPM and Knudsen’s right-hand man. President of the huge Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. of Toledo, which makes most of the automobile glass in the country, Biggers is considered by New-Dealers “the most formidable of the defense organization’s reactionaries” (New Republic, Feb. 3). He is described by the U.S. News (Jan. 31):
“A handsome, 52-year-old multi-millionaire, John Biggers has a background of practical business training and Chamber of Commerce research and statistical study. Also, he has had previous government experience, as a Republican member of the Business Advisory Council of the Department of Commerce.”
5. WILLIAM L. BATT, as deputy director, is No. 2 man in the all-important Production Division. He is president of S.K.F. Industries of Philadelphia (ball bearings) and he has long been active in the labor-hating National Association of Manufacturers.
6. W. AVERELL HARRIMAN is chief of the Industrial Materials Section of the Production Division. He is the son of the late E.H. Harriman, the railroad magnate, and is chairman of the board of the Union Pacific Railroad. Tremendously wealthy, Harriman is one of the “economic royalists” who have supported Roosevelt from the beginning of the New Deal. His interests extend beyond railroads to shipping, publishing and finance (also to polo playing).
7. W.M. HARRISON is chief of the Ships, Construction and Supplies Section. In “real life” he is vice-president and chief engineer of the four billion dollar American Telephone and Telegraph Co.
8. E.F. JOHNSON is chief of the Aircraft, Ordnance and Machine Tools Section. He is also a vice-president of General Motors Corp.
9. GEORGE M. MOFFETT heads the Mining and Mineral Products Subsection under Harriman. He is president of the Corn-Products Kenning Co., which makes imitation maple syrup and other things and has long been a speculative favorite on the Stock Exchange.
10. R.R. DEUPREE, also under Harriman, is in charge of the Agricultural and Forest Products Subsection. In quieter times he is president of Procter & Gamble, big soap makers (Ivory, Lux).
11. MASON BRITTON, under Johnson, is head of the Machine Tools Subsection. He is Vice-chairman of the big business publishers, McGraw-Hill Publishing Co.
12. HAROLD S. VANCE, Britton’s predecessor, is now part-time consultant in the Machine Tools Subsection. He is chairman of the Studebaker Corp., automobile manufacturers.
 
”OPM”: Division of Priorities
13. E.R. STETTINIUS, JR., is Director of the Priorities Division (which decides which orders and products shall get right of way over others). Son of a J.P. Morgan partner, Stettinius is a “Morgan man.” He resigned the chairmanship of U.S. Steel Corp. last summer to head, with Knudsen, the original Defense Commission. Even more openly than other business men in the “defense” set-up, he has played the game of big business. He has been the chief defender of the aluminum and steel industries against critics who charge that their policies are causing or will soon cause shortages of materials.
14. JAMES F. TOWERS is assistant director of priorities. He is executive vice-president of the big New York firm of industrial engineers. Ford, Bacon & Davis.
15. CHARLES E. ADAMS is senior consultant to the division. He is also president of the Air Reduction Corp.
16. ARTHUR D. WHITESIDE, head of the Commercial Aircraft Subsection, is on leave of absence from the presidency of the well known New York financial information house of Dun & Bradstreet.
17. ERNEST M. HOPKINS, head of the Minerals and Metals Subsection, is president of Dartmouth College.
18. CARL CONWAY is a member of the Iron & Steel Priorities Subcommittee under Hopkins. He is also chairman of Continental Can Co. and a leading Wall Street speculator.
19. WALTER S. TOWER, another member of the Iron & Steel Subcommittee, is president of the steel industry’s powerful trade association, the American Iron and Steel Institute.
 
Miscellaneous War Agencies
20. COL. LEONARD P. AYRES is serving in the office of the Secretary of War as coordinator of statistics. He is nationally famous as the economic analyst of the Cleveland Trust Co.
21. NELSON ROCKEFELLER, brightest and most energetic of the present generation of Rockefellers, is chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Inter-American Affairs. His job is to promote “better understanding” between the U.S. and Latin America.
22. JAMES FORRESTAL resigned the presidency of the big Wall Street banking house of Dillon, Read & Co. last summer to-become “administrative assistant” to President Roosevelt.
23. GANO DUNN, dollar-a-year man recently delegated to arbitrate the hot dispute between New Dealers and steel executives as to expansion of the industry’s capacity, in private life is president of the J. G. White Engineering Corp.
24. RALPH BUDD, president of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, is defense commissioner in charge of railroad transportation.
25. DONALD M. NELSON, vice-president of Sears, Roebuck & Co., holds one of the most powerful jobs in the whole “defense” set-up: director of purchasing for the entire $20,000,000,000 program.
26. EDWARD BRANSOME is one of Sidney Hillman’s four aides. His job: director of labor relations in industry. His qualifications: president of the Vanadium Corporation of America.
27. CHANNING R. DOOLEY is another of Hillman’s aides: His job: director of job training. His qualifications: vice-president of Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.

Such is a partial list of the big business men now running the “defense” program. The list could be extended almost indefinitely. The individuals composing it change from month to month, as Businessman A has to go back home a while and see that his corporation is making money satisfactorily, yielding his Government post to Businessman B. In Labor Action for July 15 I compiled a list of businessmen who then occupied key posts in the “defense” organization. About half of these seem to have dropped out of sight, being replaced by other businessmen.
But however the individuals shift, the only general shift noticeable in the last six months is towards a greater preponderance of businessmen in the “defense” agencies. As the U.S. News (Jan. 31) describes the process:
“There is a new business ‘brain trust’ now in Washington, numbering in the hundreds, most of them big industrialists serving for a dollar a year, many of them in opposition to the New Deal’s domestic policies. When they first arrived in the capital, they were not given a cleat-cut sense of direction, or a right of way to follow the direction, but now all is different. The shift is away from control by the New Deal planning group. And these industrialists alone are being armed With authority to carry through the vast defense program. Now it is they who are on the inside – with almost complete control.”
It isn’t hard to guess whither these corporation executives’ “sense of direction” will lead them as the strain of an all-out war effort bears down on the national economic and social structure. The pressure of the American working class is the only power that can deflect the drive towards fascism these men will lead. Unless the great mass of working people of America take political and economic power into their own hands the course is all too clear. And Sidney Hillman is not the kind of leader American labor must have in this fight.
 



England has been at war a year and a half. Since the blitzkrieg of last May, the British Government has had, in form at least, totalitarian controls over the economy and the masses. But to what extent have these forms materialized in practice? In my last article I showed that England’s war economy is not yet totalitarian by a long shot. This time I propose to look into the matters of strikes and civil liberties.
This week’s papers report the suppression of the Daily Worker and Bevin’s plans to finally put into effect the powers to conscript labor which he has had since May 20. It looks as though the Labor-Churchill government is going to try to restrict the liberties still held by the masses. Next week I shall discuss this turn. This week let us see what measure of liberty the British masses have so far retained in 17 months of war. The British wartime social system, like the British war economy, is a ramshackle structure, a matter of compromise and confusion. The British bourgeoisie is so weak and decadent, British capitalism is so obsolete from historical viewpoint and teh British working class movement is relatively so strong that, even with the willing help of the labor bureaucracy, the ruling class is unable to go beyond a certain point in regimenting and rationing the masses for the war effort. Churchill and Beaverbrook, Bevin and Citrine – these gentlemen advance in one sector, retreat in another, reach a stalemate in a third. This makes a very complicated and contradictory general picture: strikes are outlawed – and take place; a sales tax is imposed – and also a 100% excess profits tax; the masses are rationed while the rich can gorge in unrationed restaurants – yet there has been a general rise in social benefits. Looking at one set of factors, the liberals conclude England is more democratic and progressive than ever. Looking at another, many on the left conclude that England is already a quasi-fascist state. The actuality seems to be more complex than either of these views. Let us see.
 
Civil Liberties
The most striking evidence of the as yet non-totalitarian nature of British wartime society is the remarkable way that civil liberties have been preserved. There seems to be little more political censorship of the press in England today than there is over here. The suppression last week of the Daily Worker is the first instance, to my knowledge, of suppression of a left-wing paper. The left Labor Party organ. The Tribune, the Independent Labor Party’s New Leader, the Anarchist’s War Commentary, all of these and many other leftwing papers, continue to appear regularly. There is likewise great freedom of assembly: Communist speakers still are not barred in Hyde Park: on January 12 last the Stalinists organized a “people’s Convention of 2,200 in London, calling for freedom to India, a “people’s government” and a “people’s peace”, at which, according to the N.Y. Times, “there was not a single policeman in sight and no disturbance of any kind”. Debate in Parliament is also unrestricted: Labor and I.L.P. members have been able to force the government to withdraw such steps as Minister of Information Duff Cooper’s plan for extending the censorship of the press to political matters and Home Minister Anderson’s proposal to set up in “war zones” special one-man courts with death powers and no right of appeal. Finally, the treatment of conscientious objectors – of whom there have been tens of thousands – seems to have been, on the whole, remarkably humane and intelligent.
There are good reasons for all this, of course, which have nothing to do with Mr. Churchill’s burning love for democracy (a love discovered only since Hitler opened war on the British Empire). One is that none of the left-wing parties in England today – including the Stalinists under that head for simplicity’s sake – are strong enough to be dangerous. Another is the pressure exerted by the rank and file of the working class, a pressure which cannot be disregarded by the Labor members of the Government. And finally there is the historical tradition of civil liberty in England, which is far more developed than in any other leading nation, including this country.
 
Social Security
Since the Labor Party entered the Government, there have been increases in various social benefits. The unemployment dole has been increased from 26 to 30 shillings a week for married couples; the scope of unemployment insurance has been extended to take in tin. additional 500,000 workers; the scale of compensation for civilians killed or wounded by “enemy action” has been increased; old age pensions have been raised from ten shillings to one pound weekly; there has been an increase in weekly allowances of wives and families of men in the armed forces.
Three things must be said about this list:

the original levels of most of these social benefits were very low; and the additions are quite small;
hese gains are of minor importance compared to the general decline in living standards forced on the workers by the war effort (of this, more in my next article);
these gains are an index not to the democratic idealism of the Tories (or the Labor Party leaders!) but to the weakness of the ruling class on the one hand, and the strength of. the working class on the other.

This leads us to the matter of –
 
Strikes
Among the “emergency powers” granted by parliament to the Tory-Labor government last May was the right to forbid strikes and lockouts. As Minister of Labor, Bevin clearly has this power in form. In practice, however, being an experienced and shrewd trade unionist, he has wisely followed a policy of talking tough – and doing very little to back up his threats. Thus on June 7, the N.Y. Times reported: “Mr. Bevin outlawed strikes and lockouts by making acceptance of arbitration decrees mandatory in all labor disputes.” This would seem conclusive enough: no more strikes! Yet on July 13 we find the N.Y. Post printing a dispatch headed: “BRITISH BAN STRIKES – Decree authorizes Bevin to Act”. This story merely repeats the June 7 Times story about compulsory arbitration; the only difference is that this time the government has issued a special “order-in-council” on the matter.
The British working class is notoriously law-abiding and orderly. Since last May there have been no strikes in England. But there have been a great many “work holidays” – and it would take a very clever lawyer, with lots of time on his hands, to distinguish a “work holiday” from a “strike”. A few of these strikes have been reported in small news items in the American Press. For news of most of them you must go to the files of British left-wing papers like the London New Leader (a really excellent job, by the way). Many if not most of the strike have been led by “shop stewards”, elected by the rank-and-file workers in a plant to carry on the struggle against the employers which the regular trade union officials, tied to a policy of “industrial peace” during the war, have abandoned. (In a later article, I shall go more fully into this shop steward movement, at present the most significant expression of the class struggle in England.) Let me set down a few notes on recent strikes, to give an idea of their scope and nature:

Oct. 10: 250 men at a Coventry aircraft plant have been on a “work holiday” for a week. Cause: the firing of a shop steward.
 
Nov. 23: 200 men have been out at Govans on the Clydebank for six weeks over the firing of a shop steward. The Clyde Shop Stewards Council is to meet on the issue and may, merge it into the larger issue of the refusal of the Clyde employers to grant a wage increase.
 
Nov. 28: The National Committee of the powerful Amalgamated Engineering Union meets to consider calling a strike of 1,500,000 construction workers. Issue: wage increase. Strike motion finally lost, by 25 to 11 votes.
 
Dec. 22: An “unofficial” strike begins, involving 5,000 tailors working on army uniforms. Issue refusal of management to fire a tailor who had violated union rules. Strike threatened to spread to other shops and to assume “serious proportions”. Finally called off, after a week, through intervention by the national union officials.
 
Dec. 28: Scottish miners, despite pleas of government to take only one day Christmas holiday, decided to take the usual two days off ... Glasgow transport workers vote overwhelmingly to stop work and seek shelter during air raids.
 
Jan. 11: Railway workers at the East End docks in London go back to work after successful strike. Issue: extra rates of pay for carrying out “highly dangerous” fire-watching duties.

Thus the anti-strike decrees have remained as much of a dead letter as the rest of the “totalitarian” powers granted the government last May. This is not because of any shrinking on Bevin’s part from outlawing strikes, of course, but simply because it is politically impossible for him with the best will in the world, to enforce such measures in the face of serious opposition from the British workers. (Hillman over here is in much the same position.) This is not to say that Bevin, by a combination of force and persuasion, has not in many instances succeeded in stifling incipient strikes. He has – just as Hillman and the top CIO-AFL bureaucracy have over here. But the process is much more difficult and complicated, the results not nearly so certain as in a real totalitarian regime such as Germany has.
When, as was the case recently in a Dundee engineering works, a strike can take place over the issue of the right to smoke on the job, one can hardly speak of totalitarianism! The British working class still has the immediate possibility of large-scale class action. The present regime maintains itself through its own strength than because of the tragic lack of revolutionary leadership in England today.
 
The Road Ahead
The liberals and the social-patriots, of course, point to the phenomena discussed in this article as evidence that Marxists have been mistaken as to the necessity of capitalism going totalitarian to fight a modern war. Let us admit frankly that many of us of the revolutionary life have exaggerated the tempo at which totalitarianism would develop in the warring “democracies”. The forms of democracy have survived a great deal better in England than many of us expected. But we were entirely right in predicting that an advanced industrial nation like England (or America) can fight an imperialist war effectively only by instituting totalitarian controls. And we were right in predicting that the British (or American) bourgeoisie would go ahead on the road to fascism in wartime as fast and as far as they dared What has happened in England is that the working class has so far been able, by militant action, to preserve n considerable degree of freedom – despite the earnest efforts of Messrs. Churchill, Bevin. Morrison & Co.
But indications have multiplied in the last two month’s that the necessities of war are forcing the British ruling class really to put the screws on both the liberties and the living standards of the masses. There is no space here to go into this matter, which must wait until the next article in the series – which will describe the recent cuts in food rations, the putting into effect last October of a heavy sales tax on consumers goods, the installation a few weeks ago of Bevin as director-in-chief of production, and the remarkable confidential memorandum of Ex-Ambassador Kennedy to President Roosevelt. The direction in which the Tory-Labor government is pushing British society is clear enough. The next few weeks will probably see a great intensification pf the pressure towards totalitarianism, under the generalship of that idol of the liberal weeklies, “Ernie” Bevin. For this is an imperialist war and the existence of such liberties as still obtain in England, far from being an indication of the non-imperialist nature of the war, as the social-patriots maintain, is in sharp conflict with the necessities of the war. I venture to predict that it will not be many moons before the liberal weeklies begin to wring their hands over the (to them) incomprehensible actions of Bevin, the Paladin of democracy.
 



TWO YEARS BEFORE HITLER came to power, Trotsky wrote: “A victory of fascism in Germany would signify the inevitable war against the U.S.S.R. It would be sheer political stupidity to believe that once they came into power, the German National Socialists would begin with a war against France or even Poland.... If he wins power. Hitler will become the super-Wrangel of the world bourgeoisie.” (Germany, the Key to the International Situation, 1931.)
It would be hard to compress more errors in prediction into so small a space. The “inevitable” war against the U.S.S.R. has turned out to be quite “evitable”; the National Socialists did begin with a war against France and Poland; Hitler and his movement are shattering to bits the world order of the bourgeoisie. Trotsky made these errors because he made a mistake typical of post-war Marxist thinking: he overestimated economic forms and underestimated political controls of these forms. The Soviet Union was a “workers state” with collectivized property forms; the Nazis were the political agents of German finance capitalism, which represented private capitalism in its most advanced, rationalized, concentrated form. The “antagonism” between these economies was therefore so acute as to make war between them “inevitable” (a dangerous word in any scientific discussion, doubly so in a period like this one) . When the war actually came, however, these two antagonistic economies made a pact for joint imperialist aggression, and the super-Wrangel of the bourgeoisie set his armies in motion against France and England (with America as sleeping partner), the nations where the bourgeois order is making its last historical stand. What Trotsky did not foresee was that new forms of political control were to arise during the Thirties which, while retaining the economic forms of socialism (Russia) and capitalism (Germany), injected into them an entirely new content – call it, for want of a better term, “bureaucratic collectivism” – which has turned out to be the decisive factor.
 
Our Analysis of the War
Even after the war came and the Soviet Union made its pad with the Nazis and entered on a course of military conquest, even then Trotsky refused to revise his theory, and allowed the American movement to split in half over the question of Russia’s role in the war. The Workers Party, I think, was correct in its interpretation of this issue. But after the split, there came the other big surprise of the war: Germany’s conquest of the Continent in 38 days of Blitzkrieg. Our analysis of the war had been that it would be in all essentials a repetition of the 1914–1918 war – a long-drawn out stalemate (with the Maginot and Siegfried Lines in place of the trench fortifications of the last war) between capitalist imperialisms of the same order, and with the “democracies” having a distinct edge because of their superior wealth and resources, their control of the seas and their support from the United States. In a long war of the 1914-1918 type these advantages would have probably proved decisive – as they did last time. But while the Allies were fighting the last war over again, the Germans were fighting a different kind of war, expressing a different, non-capitalist economic and social order. Germany’s crushing superiority in war machines (planes, tanks, guns) over the richer “democracies,” the new military tactics her armies displayed, and the new and non-capitalist ways in which she is now exploiting her victory – all of these phenomena can be explained only on the basis of a radical difference in economic and social systems between Germany and France-England.
But, just as Trotsky refused to reshape his theories on the Soviet Union when events proved them incorrect, so the Workers Party refused to reshape its mistaken conception of the war and of the nature of German fascism when the Blitzkrieg exposed its falsity. (It should be understood that the Blitzkrieg did not cause the differentiation between the German and the Anglo-French-American economic systems which it is the main purpose of this article to analyze and evaluate. This differentiation began to take decisive shape in 1936. The Blitzkrieg was simply an unmistakable indication of the change that had taken place several years previously.) The most serious attempt of the Workers Party leadership to answer the problems raised by the Blitzkrieg was J.R. Johnson’s article, which took up the entire July issue of The New International, entitled: “Capitalist Society and the War.” With his customary broad sweep, Johnson marshals sixteen printed pages of arguments drawn from every epoch and every clime to prove his main point: although we didn’t expect the Blitzkrieg, there is nothing really unexpected about it. (Cannon sang the same tune during the factional struggle: “Nothing has changed. We reaffirm our old position. Don’t get excited.”) Johnson goes back to Hannibal to demonstrate that the side taking the offensive has a big military advantage. (But why was it the Nazis and not the Allies who took the offensive?) He shows conclusively that Germany is the most highly industrialized and rationalized nation in Europe and so naturally could create a greater war machine than the Allies. (But an even more convincing argument, on economic grounds, could be made and was made that the Allies had the advantage.) He shows that the German Army has for generations been the most formidable military force in Europe. So the whole business can be explained simply in terms of higher industrial development and a more effective Army, factors which considerably antedate the coming to power of Hitler.
Excellent! But the question naturally arises: if the nature of the war and of the Nazi economy was so dear that the veriest tyro, armed with Johnson’s kind of “Marxism,” could correctly judge events, then how does it happen that we did not judge the events correctly? If Johnson’s premise is accepted, then he and all of us must be accounted either fools or ignoramuses to have failed to take into account such long-familiar factors as the high level of German industry and the military prowess of the Prussianized German Army. But I don’t think Johnson is a fool, nor the rest of us. We failed to understand both the nature of this war and the character of the Nazi economy because of the forms of our thought, because we used in our analysis an instrument which is badly in need of reshaping if it is to be useful in understanding the world of 1940 – the instrument of “traditional” or “orthodox” Marxism.
 
What Is “Marxism”?
Here it is important to state clearly that by “traditional Marxism” I mean not the basic theories of Marx and Engels but the school of thought which has developed historically since 1917 on this basis, and especially its present-day manifestations in this country in the Trotskyist movement. Personally, I consider myself a “Marxist” in that (1) I accept what seems to me the basic structure of Marxism, namely, historical materialism, the Marxist theories of the state and of classes, the economic contradictions (and increasing un-workability) of capitalism, the necessity for revolution, the desirability of socialism, and even – as an illuminating and useful way of interpreting history, not as a universal scientific law – the dialectic; and (2) I know no more realistic and fruitful approach to history than the Marxian. It is true that the bureaucratic collective regimes in Russia and Germany cannot be explained in the terms of Marx’s specific analysis of capitalism, since, in my view, they represent a post-capitalist kind of economic organization. But a distinction must be made between Marx’s analysis of capitalism and his more general theories, applicable to all historical periods. These latter, I think, are the best tools we have to analyze the new phenomenon of bureaucratic collectivism. I am also a great admirer of Marx’s concrete and empirical approach to historical questions, his painstaking examination of data, and the scientific character of his thought. In this article I have, therefore, argued the case pretty much in Marxist terms. The problem before us is not to “defend” Marxism by trying to show that basic changes are not occurring in the world today, but rather to recognize these changes and to use Marxism as an instrument to cope with them. 
Marxism I conceive to be a scientific discipline, a method of interpreting data and an instrument for bringing about political change. As such an instrument, its value is not in itself (as is the case with a religious doctrine, for example) but rather in its efficiency in achieving certain ends. Change and modification from time to time are therefore normal procedures. The dominant tendency in post-war Marxist thought, however, seems to be rather to regard Marxism as something having value in itself, hence something to be “defended” against the onslaught of the impious and unorthodox, just as a religious person defends the doctrines of his church. (I cannot conceive of “defending” a tool.)
 
“Traditional Marxism” No Longer Adequate
It is this kind of “Marxism,” which has unfortunately long dominated the Trotskyist movement, that I criticize throughout this article. It is this kind of thinking we must get rid of, especially in a period like this one, when the death-crisis of capitalism is proceeding at such a headlong pace and with such convulsive and unexpected turns. In The Third International After Lenin, Trotsky memorably contrasts the relatively gradual, “organic” evolution of capitalism in the pre-1914 period with the “irregular, spasmodic curtailments and expansions of production” and the “frenzied oscillations of the political situation towards the left and towards the right” in the post-war period. (The terms in which, in 1928, Trotsky criticised Bukharin’s Draft Program can unfortunately be largely applied to Trotsky’s own analysis of the evolution of the Russian and the German economies a decade later – “abstract... supra-historical ... didactic ... scholastic.”) The conclusions which Trotsky in 1928 drew from his analysis are doubly to the point today:
“The role of the subjective factor in a period of slow, organic development can remain quite a subordinate one ... But as soon as the objective prerequisites to the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism have matured, the key to the whole historical process passes into the hands of the subjective factor, that is, the party ... Without an extensive and generalized dialectical comprehension of the present epoch as an epoch of abrupt turns, a real reeducation of the young parties, a correct strategical leadership of the class struggle, a correct combination of tactics, and, above all, a sharp and bold and decisive rearming at each successive breaking point of the situation – all this is impossible.”
The pre-war social democracy, as Trotsky points out, could get along on a policy of following in the wake of the development of capitalist society; a miscalculation here or there was not fatal, since the general line of evolution was clear and the whole process proceeded so slowly as to allow time to reorient the party to meet the new conditions. Today, however, just as it is necessary for the state to intervene consciously into the economy, so too it is necessary for the revolutionary party to intervene positively into the class struggle, to estimate with scientific accuracy its precise tempo and character at the given historical moment. But this cannot be done successfully unless the theoretical weapons of the party are constantly overhauled and reshaped to meet changing conditions, or, in Trotsky’s words, unless there is “above all, a sharp and bold and decisive rearming at each successive breaking-point of the situation.” [1]
 
“What Is Capitalism”?
Before we can very well decide whether Germany today is a “capitalist” nation, we must first agree on a definition of “capitalism.” As it has historically developed, the capitalist system has various features, such as – political: democracy; ethical: liberalism, humanitarianism; philosophical: materialism; juridical: substitution of contract for status in social relations; economic: private property, production for profit, not for use. The feature which distinguishes it from all other historical systems of property relations, and the one which is basic in the sense that the other features can be shown to derive from it, is the last – production for profit, which means the regulation of production by the market. All of these features disappear under fascism, but it is the destruction of the capitalist market that decisively marks fascism as a new and different system.
In his introduction to the Living Thoughts of Karl Marx volume, Trotsky writes (emphasis mine throughout):
In contemporary society, man’s cardinal tie is exchange. Any product of labor that enters into the process of exchange becomes a commodity. Marx began his investigation with the commodity and deduced from that fundamental cell of capitalist society those social relations that have objectively shaped themselves on the basis of exchange, independently of man’s will. Only by pursuing this course is it possible to solve the fundamental puzzle – how in capitalist society, in which each man thinks for himself and no one thinks for all, are created the relative proportions of the various branches of economy indispensable to life.
The worker sells his labor power, the farmer takes his produce to market, the money lender or banker grants loans, the storekeeper offers an assortment of merchandise, the industrialist builds a plant, the speculator buys and sells stocks and bonds – each having his own considerations, his own private plans, his own concern about wages or profit. Nevertheless, out of this chaos of individual strivings and actions emerges a certain economic whole, which, true, is not harmonious but contradictory, yet does give society the possibility not merely to exist but even to develop. This means that, after all, chaos is not chaos at all, that in some way it is regulated automatically, if not consciously.... By accepting and rejecting commodities, the market, as the arena of exchange, decides whether they do or do not contain within themselves socially necessary labor, thereby determines the ratios of various kinds of commodities necessary for society....
This seems to me a reasonably accurate description of how capitalism works. There are two main elements: (1) production is regulated by exchange, that is, by the prospects of the individual and corporate property owners making a profit by selling their goods on the market; (2) this market regulates “not consciously” but as an impersonal, autonomous mechanism working “independent of man’s will.” [2]
In Germany today the market still exists, but it has lost its autonomy: it does not determine production, but is used merely as a means of measuring and expressing in economic terms the production which is planned and controlled by the Nazi bureaucracy. The old capitalist forms exist, but they express an entirely new content. [3] Since 1936, production in Germany has not been determined by the market but by the needs of Wehrwirtschaft: guns, tanks, shoes, steel, cement are produced in greater or lesser quantities not because there is more or less prospect of making profits on this or that commodity, but because this or that is considered more or less useful for making war. Economically, this is production for use, the use being, of course, a highly undesirable one from the social point of view. [4] Nor is this production controlled by a market mechanism working “independent of man’s will” but by a bureaucratic apparatus which plans production (as against the well-known “anarchy” of capitalist production) and which consciously and wilfully works out the best solution to the particular problem. No individual producer thinks “for himself”; on the contrary, if not one man, at least a small group of top bureaucrats, “think for all.” Trotsky speaks of each individual producer having “his own private plan,” but Dr. Ley of the Labor Front says: “There are no longer any private people. All and every one are Adolf Hitler’s soldiers, and a soldier is never a private person.”
 
This Is Not Capitalism
If we take Trotsky’s description of the role of the banker, the farmer, the worker, etc., under capitalism and apply it to Nazi Germany, we must conclude that, whatever Nazism is, it is not capitalism. Let us see.
“The worker sells his labor power.”
The labor market no longer exists. The price at which the worker sells his labor to the employer is set by the Labor Trustee for his industry, and wages cannot be changed without the Trustee’s OK. In most basic industries the worker cannot change his job without such permission, nor can the employer either hire or fire any large number of workers without permission. By decree of June 22, 1938, the state can conscript labor “for tasks of special political importance,” and hundreds of thousands of workers were thus drafted from German industry to build the Polish and Westwall fortifications in 1939. The present widespread use of war prisoners as conscript labor is an extension of this principle. The state has become a real “employer” of German labor and – as with the emergence of the state as the real “owner” and “entrepreneur” in the sphere of production – this means that the political aspect of the relationship has become more important than its economic aspect.
“The farmer takes his produce to market.”
But the price he gets there, like all prices, is determined by the Reich Price Commissar. The state rationing of foodstuffs instituted in the summer of 1939 and the slate control of foreign trade further make it possible for the state to control agricultural production. The Hereditary Homestead Law of 1933 removed some 700,000 peasant families from the class of capitalist producers and fixed them to the land as firmly and permanently as medieval serfs. The state is constantly requiring the farmers to produce more of this or less of that, and the grumblings of the bureaucracy about recalcitrant “kulaks” often has a real Soviet flavor to it. 
“The banker grants loans.”
But the criterion is no longer profitability but usefulness to the “interests of the community,” as defined by the bureaucracy. No loan of any size may be granted, regardless of how “sound” economically it may be, unless it furthers the general war effort. The German banking system, furthermore, has been directly subordinated to the state. In 1917, the Reichsbank, fortress of German finance capital under the Weimar Republic and in the early years of Nazism, was “placed under Chancellor Hitler’s direct authority as an organ of the German government.” To quote Reimann’s The Vampire Economy: “The totalitarian state reverses the former relationship between the state and the banks. Previously, their political influence increased when the state needed financial help. Now the opposite holds true. The more urgent the financial demands of the state become, the stricter measures are taken by the state in order to compel these institutions to invest their funds as the state may wish.”
“The storekeeper offers an assortment of merchandise.”
At prices set by the Reich Price Commissar, without regard to their profitability. When the demand for industrial labor of the Second Four Year Plan outran the supply, the bureaucracy even deliberately used its control of retail prices to drive out of business and into industrial jobs many shopkeepers. Furthermore, since a main aim of Nazi economics is to curtail spending on consumers’ goods in favor of spending on munitions, the “assortment of merchandise” the storekeeper offers has been steadily reduced by state action at the source of supply and by state rationing. The shopkeeper is reduced to a cog in the machinery of state distribution. 
“The industrialist builds a plant.”
That is, he builds it if he is able to get a permit from the state to do so. It he cannot, he is unable either to build a new plant or to repair his old one. The permit is granted or not granted, depending on the view the state official concerned takes as to (1) how much the proposed plant is necessary for war purposes; (2) whether the materials and labor needed could be better used elsewhere. Profits are not relevant. Thus although many industries have made large profits and have accumulated liquid cash reserves, they are unable to spend their money on much-needed new plants, with the result that many sectors of German industry (those considered least essential to the war effort by the bureaucracy) are nearing a state of physical collapse. Contrariwise, if the state decides that certain new plants should be built – for exploiting iron ore of such low grade as not to be profitable, or for making expensive artificial rubber or oil – then, whether he sees profit or ruin as the result, “the industrialist builds a plan.” Much of the recent ersatz, industrial plant was built up by such forced investment of private profits.
“The speculator buys and sells stocks and bonds.”
The continued existence of the Berlin Boerse seems to give a peculiarly intense personal pleasure to orthodox Marxists. For how can a stock exchange exist in a non-capitalist society? Like all other markets in Germany, the Boerse has lost its autonomy. Its fluctuations can be and are controlled by the state, which controls all the economic factors which influence the Boerse. It is also controlled more directly: the new capital market is reserved almost wholly for the sale of government securities, with a few war goods producers being allowed from time to time to issue new securities. In so far as it has any important function today, the Boerse is a medium for extracting funds from the bourgeoisie for the state’s purposes. For the rest, it is a vestigial organ of no utility or significance, like the vermiform appendix. How could it be otherwise when, according to official estimates, two-thirds of the national income passes through the hands of the State and can be directed into whatever channels those in control of the state think best?
To sum up the matter: the decisions that in a capitalist economy are made by the entrepreneur on the basis of his expectation of profit, in Nazi Germany since 1936 have been made by the state bureaucracy. To carry out the Second Four Year Plan in certain key industries, for example, Goering appointed a number of Reich Commissars. The function of this official is described, in a Nazi journal, in these terms? “He deals with factory regulations and technical problems, the process of work and its regulation, employment, distribution of raw materials, the flow of investment, the control of the capital market… coordination of capital goods production with consumer’s goods production and ... exports.”
 
Commodities Lose Their Mystery
It is illuminating to reread Marx’s Capital with the present German economy in mind. The two great riddles which Marx so brilliantly solved – the nature of commodity production and the process of extracting surplus value – seem to lose, in a fascist economy, most of the subtle mystery which cloaks them under capitalism.
“The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails,” begins Capital, “presents itself as ‘an immense accumulation of commodities,’ its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity.” What is a commodity? It is, says Marx, “a very queer thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties.” The reason for this mystery is the dual nature of commodities: they are “both objects of utility and, at the same time, depositories of value,” that is, they exist as both “use values” and “exchange values.” It is the latter which gives them their capitalist character, and Marx describes how these “exchange values” are realized through the market (emphasis mine):
As a general rule, articles of utility become commodities only because they are products of the labor of private individuals or groups of individuals who carry on their work independently of each other. The sum total of the labor of all these private individuals forms the aggregate labor of society. Since the producers do not come into social contact with each other until they exchange their products, the specific social character of each producer’s labor does not show itself except in the act of exchange.
When a state bureaucracy displaces the market as the regulator of production, the individual producers do not have to wait until the verdict of the market has been rendered to find out whether they have been producing socially useful goods or not, increasing or decreasing their production according to this verdict. They come into social contact with each other in the sphere of production, that is, they produce according to a conscious, prearranged plan, so that it would be technically possible – however politically inadvisable – for each individual producer to know before he begins to produce just where his own contribution fits into the general scheme.
A page of two later, Marx writes:
The categories of bourgeois economy consist of such like forms. [He has been describing the forms in which capitalist value is expressed.] They are forms of thought expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite, historically determined mode of production viz., the production of commodities. The whole mystery of commodities, all the magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labor as long as they take the form of commodities, vanishes therefore, so soon as we come to other forms of production.
Today we may see in Germany what Marx meant: “the whole mystery of commodities” has indeed vanished there. Steel is produced there for use, in guns, in tanks, in ships. Shoes are produced for use, on feet. The fact that the shortage of shoes (in itself produced by state planning) would have made the building of new shoe plants extremely profitable in the last few years meant nothing to the bureaucracy. That was a “theological nicety” they disregarded in the interests of Wehrwirtschaft. One secret of the superior effectiveness of the Nazi war economy as compared to the British or French is this directness of its approach, this freedom to plan for use without bothering about the mysteries of the market.
 
Labor’s Fetters Become Visible
So, too, with the other great mystery of the capitalist mode of production: the extraction of surplus value. There has unquestionably been an intensive exploitation of labor under the Nazi regime, expressing itself in the lengthened working hours and lowered living standards. [5] From this certain Marxists seem to infer, in a vague way, that Germany is still a capitalist state. But obviously all class societies have been characterized by such exploitation. The differentiating criterion must be sought elsewhere. Marx gives it: “The essential difference between the various economic forms of society, between, for instance, a society based on slave labor and one based on wage labor, lies only in the mode in which this surplus-labor is in each case extracted from the actual producer, the laborer.” Under slavery this surplus-labor (the labor over and above that needed for the maintenance and reproduction of the laborer himself) is appropriated by the ruling class in one way, under feudalism in another, and under capitalism in still another, through the appropriation of “surplus value.”
Surplus value is realized through the mechanism of the market system. The worker sells his labor power to the capitalist. Here, as in the case of the commodity, what seems at first glance a perfectly simple transaction, Marx was able to demonstrate is actually very subtle and complex. In previous forms of economy, the subject class could not possibly overlook the fact of its subjection, since its surplus-labor was directly, openly appropriated by the ruling class. But under capitalism, this relationship is concealed by the market mechanism. “He [the worker] and the owner of money meet in the market, and deal with each other as on the basis of equal rights, with this difference alone, that one is buyer, the other seller; both, therefore, equal in the eyes of the law ... He must constantly look upon his labor-power as his own property, his own commodity, and this he can only do by placing it at the disposal of the buyer temporarily, for a definite period of time. By this means alone can he avoid renouncing his rights of ownership over it.” The result is that the worker conceives of himself as the owner of a commodity (his labor-power) which he sells to the employer just as any owner sells any other commodity – free to dispose of his private property as he thinks best, to sell or not sell according to the price offered. Thus he doesn’t realize he is contributing surplus-labor to the employer, and it was of course Marx’s great task to make this clear to him. “The Roman slave was held by fetters; the wage laborer is bound to his owner by invisible threads ... His economical bondage is both brought about and concealed by the periodic sale of himself, by his change of masters, and by the oscillation in the market price of labor-power.”
In Nazi Germany, the threads have again become visible. Since wages have been frozen along with prices by state action, there are no more “oscillations in the market price of labor power.” Nor is there any “change of masters,” since the state is now his master, exercising all the functions of the employer: setting of wage rates, conditions of labor, hiring and firing. It is true that the forms of the old labor market are still for the most part kept up – though even here, as I have noted above, there is a trend towards direct state conscription of labor power – but these, as in the case of the capitalist market in general, are purely forms. A strike for higher wages or shorter hours would have to be directed against the state power which decides wages and hours; it would become at once a political act, to be dealt with directly by the Gestapo. The private “employer” is little more than a straw boss, enforcing orders handed down to him by the state bureaucracy. This change in some ways greatly intensifies the sharpness of the struggle between exploited and exploiter. But this struggle takes place in terms quite different from those which Marx described as characteristic of the capitalist system of society.
*  *  *
The objection that has probably occurred to many readers long before this point is that I am describing a kind of “pure” capitalism, in which competition and the laws of the market both have absolute validity, that this sort of system has never existed, and that the whole trend of evolution of modern capitalism has been away from it. Long before fascism, you had the rise of monopolistic finance-capital, in which these laws of the market were also violated on a large scale. Yet no one denies that monopoly capitalism is also capitalism.
In the following sections, I propose to deal with twentieth-century monopoly capitalism and to try to show that, although fascism clearly is the logical extension of this system, it differs from it basically. It has been necessary to spend a few pages on analyzing “pure” capitalism because only by first looking at “pure” capitalism is it possible to separate out its basic theory, to determine what are the essential characteristics which must be found if an economic system is to be termed “capitalistic.” This, of course, is why Marx spends most of his first volume on a dissection of an admittedly “ideal” capitalist system which never existed and never could exist. In the kind of monopoly capitalism that has grown up in the twentieth century, it is generally agreed that these essential characteristics of capitalism do exist and do determine production – though in a perverted and weakened form. What I have tried to show above is that in Germany they do not determine production; they have not been perverted or weakened, but rather displaced.

Notes
1. The attention of traditional Marxism, especially of the Trotskyist movement. has been centered almost wholly on how Hitler came to power, rather than on what happened afterwards. Thus we find that practically all the best known Marxist (or Stalino-Marxist) works on German fascism – Dutt, Guerin, Brady, Henri. Schumann – were written before the decisive “breaking-point” of 1936; that Trotsky published only one study – a brief pamphlet in 1934 – on the post-1933 development of German fascism, and that in the whole run of The New International, the theoretical organ of the movement from 1934 to the present, there have been printed only four articles on the subject: a long editorial on the significance of the 1934 “blood purge” (which has turned out to be a complete miscalculation); a chapter reprinted from Guerin’s Fascism and Big Business; Johnson’s recent Capitalist Society and the War; and Robbins’ The Nature of German Economy in the following issue. Such blindness to a major historical development suggests a radically mistaken conception of the period we live in. (The two post-Blitzkrieg articles are, of course, attempts to show that nothing has really happened. It is bad to be blind. It is worse not to realize it.)
2. Compare with Trotsky’s description of capitalism, the definition of fascist economy recently given by Otto Dietrich, Nazi press chief: “Economic society is not a mechanism regulating itself automatically ... It is an organism that is regulated and directed from one central point.”
3. Those Marxists who insist that the persistence of these forms – profits. wages, prices, etc. – proves that the German economy is still capitalist should remember that in the Soviet Union these forms also largely exist. The Soviet state trusts keep books in capitalist style and if they don’t show profits, the managers are liquidated; the workers are paid wages in rubles and spend them in shops on food, clothing, etc.; there is even a budding rentier class, living on the proceeds of investments in 6% government bonds. But most of us would agree that this is not a capitalist economy, that its contradictions are not those of capitalism but of quite another kind. (Speaking of forms note that formally Germany is still a republic: the Weimar Constitution is still formally intact, and Hitler rules merely by virtue of certain extraordinary emergency powers granted him quite legally under the Constitution.)
4. This seems a good point at which to clear up certain misconceptions as to terminology. In my Partisan Review article, and throughout this article. I use such terms as “a social war,” “production for use,” and “black socialism.” These terms are generally used in a favorable, approving sense: I use them, however, in these cases in a purely descriptive sense. Once this is understood, it should be possible to avoid much misdirected indignation.
The term “social” I use as referring not to the general interests of society, but as an adjective describing what the noun “society” means. It can be applied to this war in two senses: (1) it is a “social” war in the sense that in my view, Germany represents one social system (bureaucratic collectivism) and England another (democratic capitalism), which is not to say that either is thereby endorsed; (2) war today is a “social” enterprise in the sense that to prosecute it successfully the whole society must be organized for a general group-aim, the winning of the war.
By “production for use,” I mean this: although war materials are fold to the state by private producers, who make a profit, this is an incidental aspect of the transaction. The state does not buy more or less guns depending oh the market price of guns at the moment; the production of munitions is not regulated by their profitability. The state – and the ruling class whose interests it defends – must have munitions to survive, and they must be produced according to a plan and regardless of market considerations. (Nationalization of munitions industries, actually carried out in France under Blum and today in England, is not a serious blow at capitalism.) The objection is also raised that munitions are produced for profit in the sense that the aim of the war (in capitalist nations) is to win greater profits. But the purpose for which munitions are to be used has nothing to do with the economic forma within which they are produced. A gunsmith who makes a gun to sell is producing for the market. A gunsmith who makes a gun for his own use is producing for use – even though he later takes his gun, goes out hunting, and makes a profit from the sale of his game.
As to “black socialism,” a formulation which seems to be especially enraging, it means simply that in Germany you have certain of the economic characteristics of socialism together with a most reactionary political and social system. Much the same situation exists in the Soviet Union, and Shachtman’s formulation of “state socialism” is the same sort of an attempt to find a term combining these discordant elements.
5. J.R. Johnson. writing in the July New International [Capitalist Society and the War], absurdly overrates this factor: “We can sum up the ‘dynamism’ of fascism in a sentence. Every victory of Hitler in every field is due to his first act on coming into power – the destruction of the organized working-class movement.” In my opinion, the superiority of fascist to capitalist economy is due less to its undoubtedly more intense exploitation of human labor than to its superior ability to plan and control national production without hindrance from the archaic market system.
 



“The outstanding lesson revealed by the evolution of Britain’s war economy to date is that any attempt to achieve a compromise solution between a free economy and total ‘Wehrwirtschaft’ (war economy), particularly when faced by an enemy who has long since made the full transformation and is master of its technique, means not only skirting the very edge of disaster, but also foregoing the basic advantages of the old system without reaping the essential benefits of the new.
“This does not mean that there must be a slavish imitation of German practices, although much of what Britain has done has been necessarily in conformity with the same pattern, and even more of Marshal Goering’s machinery, with suitable minor alterations, could have been copied to advantage in the past 13 months.
“Thus this island must try, at least, to operate a total war economy ...”
So begins a 100-page confidential report by Joseph P. Kennedy, until lately, U.S. Ambassador to England, to President Roosevelt. The date – according to the Stalinoid newsletter, In Fact, which presents excerpts from the document in its January 13 issue – is October 10, 1940. These paragraphs gibe with the conclusions arrived at so far in this series:

only a totalitarian regime, in a capitalist nation like England, can put up an effective light against Nazi Germany;
England so far does not have such a regime, either, in the field of war economy (article 3 in the series) or in respect to the working class (article 4).

The problem of the day facing the Tory-Labor government in England, therefore, is how to advance more rapidly towards totalitarian controls, towards what Kennedy calls “long term planning forced by State fiat to maximize this country’s industrial effort in accord with the principle of totalitarian Wehrwirtschaft”. This is now on the order of the day, and it is Bevin, most powerful figure in the Labor bureaucracy, whose job it is to find a solution. In the last few weeks, he has already embarked on the road, with the steps to conscript labor.
The Kennedy memorandum indicates the approach of this new turn:
“There is undoubtedly a wide and growing opinion that the labor market has still too much liberty to go its own way and that the time has come lo bring labor under further compulsion ... According to usually reliable sources, Mr. Bevin has felt that the workers were entitled to a 4 or 6 months period to be free to do what they wished with their new or extra war earnings. The time is now shortly approaching, however, when the difficult and unpalatable job of the Churchill-Labor government must be to tell the workers that there is no way of avoiding serious inflation except through the wage earners being prepared to cut expenditures and to consume less. With open wage controls ‘political poison’, this means in practice the adoption of some sort of direct levy on virtually all incomes or some form of compulsory deferred savings ... or a very much wider extension of rationing and supply prohibitions; possibly a combination of all of these methods.”
Recent events seem to bear out this analysis. On December 1, the government ordered the wholesale supply of a wide range of consumer goods reduced by 50%, and also put into effect drastic reductions in meat and milk rations, which were extended even further six weeks later. And on January 6 Churchill announced a new “Big Four brain trust” to be given complete control of production: the Tories Beaverbrook and Duncan, and the Laborites Bevin and Alexander. Bevin, continuing as Labor Minister, was also made top boss of this supreme production authority. There have been complaints in the Labor press that this new committee is armed with insufficient powers over private business, that it will be able to coordinate and control production little better than the previous inadequate machinery has been.
But the point of the reshuffle seems to be not the better control of business – the Tories are in firmer political control of the government today than at any time since last May – but rather of labor. It looks as though Bevin were being put into a position where he can, at last, really crack down on labor. His job will not be an easy one. As we have seen, the British working class is still strong. Yet the brute pressure of war economics under capitalism can no longer be safely resisted: the masses must be put on short rations. How that Bevin is making the attempt, we may expect a dramatic intensification of class struggle in England.
The Kennedy Memorandum exaggerates the “now or extra war earnings” the British workers have enjoyed up to now. Bevin & Co. have already done a good job in reducing working-class living standards – though, as Kennedy correctly emphasizes, nothing compared to the blitzkrieg they are now preparing. It is true that, as the liberal weeklies like to point out. over one hundred million pounds have been added to British wages since the war began, and it is also true that some of the bigger and stronger unions have been able to force wages to keep within sight of living costs. But the overall picture is different: according to British Labor Research, wages have gone up 10% since the war began, while the cost of living has risen at least 23%. (This seems to be a Conservative estimate; Commerce Reports for January 11 last states that food prices have gone up no less than 58% since the war began.)
Nor is this all. The Tories have been careful to keep in their hands the financial conduct of the war, which means that the drawing up of the war budgets – which determine which class shall bear what part of the burden – was passed from the hands of the Tory. Simon, to the Tory, Wood. And Wood, protected as he is by governmental colleagues from the Labor Party, has piled taxes on the workers and the “little man” as Simon never dared to do. (One of the obvious uses of the Labor section of the present government is to get the masses to swallow the economic privations the war increasingly imposes on them.) It is true that income taxes in the high brackets now go up to 85% and that the 100% excess profits tax has driven net earnings of 337 big British companies down 21% from the last peace year (National City Bank Bulletin, Dec. 1940). And Chancellor of the Exchequer, Wood may be granted the point he made in presenting the third war budget last July: “If he confiscated every salary in the country over $8,000 a year, he said all he would get would be $280,000,000 or enough to keep the war going not quite nine days. That, he said, is his position, so it is mainly the little man who is on the spot tonight.” (Though nine days is something ...)
But there are more ways than one to skin a cat – if you want to skin it, that is. Hugh Dalton, foremost Labor Party economist, indicated one when last winter he declared baldly in parliament that the “very rich” should be taxed two pounds for every pound of their income – the extra pound lo be collected by a capital levy. “Six per cent of the population of this country.” he said then, “hold 80% of the property, and less than 2% hold 40% of the property. This is an injustice which our soldiers, sailors and airmen certainly are not fighting to maintain.” But that was before Mr. Dalton entered the government himself as Minister of Economic Warfare. Since that happy date, nothing more has been heard from him or his Labor colleagues as to a capital levy.
Nor has anything been heard from them as to the sales tax on consumers’ goods which Chancellor Wood put through last fall (also something that the Chamberlain government had never dared to do). The N.Y. Times of July 8 noted that at a meeting of the National Council of Labor, the rank and file overruled Greenwood and Morrison and insisted that the Council go on record against a sales tax. When the Churchill-Labor cabinet nevertheless tried to drive the tax through parliament, strong opposition from Labor Party members killed it – temporarily. Two months later the tax went into effect – one more indication, by the way, of the in creasing specific weight of the Tories in the present government.
 
”Meat ... or Bardia?”
The total revenue expected from the new sales tax is some $400,000,000 a year. This will run the war for less than two. weeks, at present rates of expenditure. But the tax is important less for revenue than as a means of cutting down on consumption (and thus production) of consumers’ goods. The most direct method is rationing or outright prohibition, and this is being resorted to more and. more. In a society like that of England today, this means – no matter how Bevin & Co. try to smooth over matters – a sharpening of class antagonisms. Consider, for example, the meat situation.
A few weeks’ ago the Tory Minister of Food, Lord Woolton, announced a cut in the meat ration from 47¢ worth of meat per person per week to 30¢, and two days later a further cut to 23¢ (which at war price’s means just, one pound of beef or two of mutton). “There are excellent reasons for this decision,” said Lord Woolton reassuringly, “among them the diversion of shipping to Libya. Would you rather have a little less meat ... or would you rather have Bardia?” (Another slice of Bardia, please ...) But there was more to it than Bardia. The N.Y. Times of Jan. 11 reported: “The London Trades Council went on record today protesting against the ‘scandal’ in the muddled meat supplies of Britain. They were concerned specifically with price reduction and equal distribution through the removal from power of those linked with combines and the food trust.” For Lord Woolton, as is the general practice in the Tory-Labor regime, has set up “to keep food prices at a reasonable level” a committee composed of “food manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers.”
Nor was this all. Rationing hit the working class much harder – to say the least – than it did the wealthy. The latter could buy unrationed luxury foods like chicken (at 65¢ a pound). Or they could gorge themselves without limit at expensive restaurants. The London Daily Mirror, popular tabloid, sent out a reporter with a well-filled wallet. Excerpts from his story:
Within five days I have eaten at least seven times my weekly meat ration, five times my butter ration ... Not content with this debauch, I have swallowed saddle of hare in wine sauce, lobster Thermidor, caviar, Hungarian pork goulash, quails in aspic and goose livers. In addition I have eaten two dozen oysters and a considerable quantity of fish, ranging from smoked salmon via tuna, sardines and anchovies to an enormous Dover sole. This mountain of food was obtained without the loss of a single food coupon ... I have watched the great as they dine – Morrison, Beaverbrook, Duff Cooper and Eden among them.
After this exposé and the London Trade Council protest, Lord Woolton promised to cut down food supplies to restaurants and to forbid the serving of more than one “basic dish” (fish, meat, poultry, cheese, eggs) at any single meal. But restaurant diners still don’t have to present food coupons (as housewives buying at stores do). It is an interesting footnote on this “war for democracy” that in German restaurants food has been strictly rationed since the beginning of the war.
 



Labour in the War
by John Price, with an introduction by Ernest Bevin
Penguin Books. 25 Cents
The Penguin Hansard: Verbatim Extracts from the Official Report of Debates in the House of Commons
Vol. 1: From Chamberlain to Churchill
Vol. 2: The National Effort
Penguin Books, 25 cents each
Here are three volumes in the “Penguin” series which have just reached this country from London and which should be of interest to the readers of Labor Action. Only one of them – Vol. 2 of The Penguin Hansard – is worth the general reader’s quarter, but there is something to be learned from all three.
Price’s Labour in the War is as dull a little book as I have had to wade through in a long time. It’s dull because it is a semi-official volume, written by the political secretary or the Transport and General Workers Union and with a foreword by Bevin which puts on it the official OK of the British trade union bureaucracy. It is written in that interminably long-winded and colorless style bureaucracies seem to favor, a style designed to cover up and conceal rather than to communicate.
To those innocent souls who hope that the British Labor Party, led by Bevin, will bring in socialism bloodlessly and painlessly after the war – for such innocents, this book will make sad reading. For it is clear that Price and his master, Bevin, conceive of the unions as organizations to DEFEND the existing capitalist system, to make it work better and smoother, and not as the spearhead of any working class movement against capitalism. Throughout the book, the emphasis is on how much “labor” has contributed to the war effort, how “reasonable” and “unselfish” the unions have been in subordinating their interests to the “common” war aims.
The more intelligent leaders of the British ruling class realize this full well. As Price writes, with the honest pride of a lackey whose master appreciates his services: “The place of the unions in the state is now recognized in some, though not all, government circles, amongst the better type of employers and in the more enlightened organs of the press.” So intensely respectable is Price, so determined to avoid all unpleasant themes, that, in his chapter on Trade Union Development he performs the miraculous feat of tracing the history of the British trade union movement for the past 150 years without even mentioning the 1926 general strike. (In which, by the way, his leader, Bevin, played a rather shabby part ...)
In defending the British labor movement against the horrid charge that it should have entered the government much earlier in the war, Price writes:
“If Labor members had joined Mr. Chamberlain’s government, they would have had no really adequate opportunity of influencing the conduct of the war. They would have been little more than hostages.”
But how much more than hostages are the Labor members in Mr. Churchill’s government today? It is significant that Price’s book ENDS with the formation of the Churchill-Labor government in May, 1940. Significant because he would have had to do a lot of explaining if he had carried the narrative even through the first six months of the new regime. Why did Churchill last fall accept the official leadership of the Conservative Party? Why was Laborite Morrison replaced in the vital Supply Ministry with the steel magnate, Duncan? Why was Halifax sent to Washington? Why was the Tory whip, Margesson, made Secretary for War? Above all, why has the Churchill-Labor government refused time and again to state its war aims? Mr. Price was well advised to end his book with May 1940.
 
The Parliamentary Record
Hansard is the British equivalent of The Congressional Record, and these two little books are made up wholly of extracts from this official report of the proceedings in the House of Commons. They are more interesting and valuable than similar extracts from The Congressional Record would be because the actual business of government is carried on to a much greater extent by the British Parliament than by our own Congress. The responsible ministers appear before the House frequently to explain their measures, answer questions, and generally debate the issues with the members of Parliament. (As though Roosevelt and Bull and Stimson were to argue personally for the Lend-Lease Bill in Congress, with heckling and questions from the members.) So these volumes of extracts from speeches give a vivid and often lively picture of political currents in England up through last summer (where they both end).
The first volume, titled From Chamberlain to Churchill, is the least valuable. It is devoted to the broader questions of political and military strategy, to the reactions of the House to the outbreak of the war, the Finnish war, and the Norwegian campaign. There is a good deal of pure oratory here and little that is not already well known. The chief impression one gets is the constant criticism of the policies of the Chamberlain regime and the remarkably stupidity and ineffectiveness of those policies. The bankruptcy of a ruling class which entrusted the defense of its interests to Chamberlain & Co. is underlined on every page.
The second volume, The National Effort, is devoted to the organization and debates through the summer of 1940, arranged under general headings: Munitions, Food, Trade, Labor, General Economic Policy, etc. Since I have already written at length in Labor Action on the British war economy, I won’t go into the content of the book here. It provides a rich mass of data on the subject, even though the selection of extracts (as with the other volume) naturally has a national-patriotic bias. The point must be made once more that it is strategic to end the book with June 1940, since an extension beyond then would show the discouraging (to the patriotic publishers of the Penguin series) fact that the same basic problems which were unsolved under Chamberlain are still unsolved under Churchill.
 



War by Revolution
by Francis Williams
Viking. 158 pages. $1.50
Everybody talks about revolution these days. Hitler talks about it, Bevin refers to it often. Petain uses the term almost daily and over here the liberal weeklies – like their colleague in London, the New Statesman and Nation – are constantly slinging the word around. The Man from Mars might think world revolution was at hand.
This kind of “revolution.” however, is strictly an export commodity. The idea is that if you can get the other side in the war to take your “revolutionary” talk seriously, it will be easier to win. This is the real basis of this little book by Francis Williams, a British Labor Party brain-truster who left the editorial staff of the party’s paper, the Daily Herald, to go into politics. According to the publisher’s blurb, he is “considered to be one of the coming men” in England today. His book, published in England several months ago and now reissued over here, is said to have created quite a stir in Labor Party and Liberal circles in London.
Mr. Williams’ thesis is that if this war “is fought as a national war for the victory of Britain and the established interests of Britain, it will in the end be lost. If it is fought as a war of democratic revolution in Europe it can be won.” He goes on to demonstrate in convincing detail that the conservative old order in England will never be able to meet the political drive and demagoguery of the Nazis and that there is slight military possibility of the Anglo-American alliance making headway against Hitler on the Continent by military means. He sees the only hope in the fostering of revolutionary movements in the occupied countries. Furthermore, he argues that the former European ruling classes cannot be depended on to lead these revolutions, since the Nazis can easily immobilize them (and are doing so) either by making small concessions to them as the price for political “cooperation” or by simply removing them from the posts of power. Hence it must be to the working class of Europe that any revolutionary appeals must be addressed. And in order to appeal to them, he continues, it is not enough to say that England is fighting for “freedom” or to promise them a restoration of the old world of pre-1939, since this was a world which meant poverty and insecurity for most of them.
 
An Admirable War Program
So far, so good. Most readers of this paper would agree with these points. And when the author comes to set down what he calls a “rough draft” of the war aims he urges the Churchill government to proclaim, we find such excellent sentiments as these:
“The British people ... pledge themselves in the war to fight for the establishment of a free Europe which shall give to all men and women within its territories security from poverty and avoidable distress.
“They affirm that all men and women have an equal right to share in the products of the wealth produced by their joint efforts ... and that the satisfaction of these claims must be the first consideration of all governments, taking precedence over all such interests, profits and privileges us have been common to inequalitarian societies in the past ...
“As an earnest of their intentions and of their determination to set aside all imperialist privileges the people of Britain further announce their readiness to assist forthwith in the establishment of a free and independent government of India answerable only to the people of India ... They undertake, farther, to renounce all imperial claims in their colonial possessions ...”
 
— Which Is Worth the Paper It Is Printed On
These are big and bold words. Needless to say, no such aims have been proclaimed. So what does Mr. Williams suggest should be done so as to persuade or force the present Churchill government to raise the banner of revolution – or if, as seems highly probable, this government refuses to do any such thing, to replace that government with one that will carry out his program? Mr. Williams gives us at great length his program for revolution OUTSIDE ENGLAND. But what about the revolution INSIDE ENGLAND which will be necessary before the other program can be carried out? Or doesn’t he think such a revolution will be necessary?
Apparently not, for in the whole book there is no hint – beyond the most general kind of exhortations – of what political measures must be taken in England itself. The book seems to be simply and purely an appeal to the good sense and humanity of the politicians now in control of the British government. Already it is clear that the appeal – as might have been predicted – has had no effect. The Churchill government has become steadily more right-wing in its composition, the Labor Party politicians who entered it last spring have been steadily reduced to the impotent and servile status of a Ramsay Macdonald (with the single exception of Bevin) and there have not been the slightest signs that Churchill is interested in freeing India, stating any war aims, or promoting any working class revolutions on the Continent.
Mr. Williams’ fine words have borne no fruit because he is asking of his liberal friends an impossibility – to wage a revolutionary war against Hitler (with the balance of power shifting steadily, as it always does in such cases, toward the Tories). I have no doubt he is sincere in his advocacy of working class democratic revolution, but he wrote his book on the wrong subject. What he should have discussed is how to bring about a revolution in England FIRST, as a preliminary to the revolutionary war he advocates.
 



The Assassination of Leon Trotsky
by Albert Goldman
74 pages, 15 cents. Pioneer Publishers, 116 University Place, New York City
When Leon Trotsky was brutally murdered in his home in Mexico City last summer, practically the whole American press, with the exception of the Stalinist papers (and the undercover Stalinoid PM) attributed the crime to the agents of Stalin. Many a worker, with a well-founded suspicion of the American press, no doubt thought to himself at the time: “Sounds logical, but how do I know the papers aren’t doing some more red-baiting? There’s no black-and-white PROOF that Stalin and the GPU were behind it.”
This proof now exists, in the form of this excellent little pamphlet by Albert Goldman, well known labor lawyer and legal adviser of Trotsky up to his death. As counsel for Trotsky’s widow, Goldman made a thorough investigation of the crime on the scene, and took part in the examination of “Frank Jacson,” the murderer. Here he gives the result of his investigation in a wealth of detail, much of it never before made public.
He piles up the evidence and shows beyond any reasonable doubt that

Jacson’s explanation of how he came to commit the murder is a crude lie from beginning to end,
 
Jacson himself is not what he claims to be, and
 
here is a mountain of evidence – including certain slips in Jacson’s “confession,” the origin of his passport, and his inability to explain the source of the large funds he possessed – to link him up with the one man in the whole world who had most to gain from Trotsky’s death, the man whose agents tried to shoot Trotsky earlier in the summer, the man whose orders sealed the fate of one after another of Trotsky’s family and household – namely, Josef Stalin, well described by Trotsky himself as “the Borgia of the Kremlin.”

This pamphlet, which should be put in the hands of every honest supporter of the Communist Party in this country (and there are, unfortunately, many such), closes the case of Leon Trotsky against the bloody, barbarous masters of the Soviet Union today. The charge, Murder. The verdict, Guilty!

Labor and National Defense
143 pages, $1.00. Twentieth Century Fund, 330 West 42nd Street, New York City
This survey, prepared by a group of economists, is valuable as a thorough, reasonably unbiased and up-to-date study of what the effect of the Roosevelt war program has been to date on America labor, and what it is likely to be in the future. Its main findings can be summed up:

A few months ago, economists were predicting that even when the war production program got going 100 per cent, there would still be considerable unemployment. Since then, however, the program has been so greatly expanded that unemployment will he wiped out by the middle of 1942.
 
This liquidation of unemployment is only relative, however. Actually, because of the chaotic, planless nature of capitalist production, there will always be shortages in one industry or region and surpluses of labor in another, so that, the survey estimates, even at peak war production, “there may be one or two million unemployed.”
 
The demand will be mostly for workers, with some degree of skill. “It is estimated that about 35 per cent of the men demanded will be skilled workers. 40 per cent semi-skilled and 25 per cent unskilled.”
 
It is interesting to note that this committee of bourgeois economists makes two recommendations which were pushed very hard several months ago by the CIO (and which were killed by the dollar-a-year men):



“Formation of management-worker committees in all defense industries”;
 
“wider distribution of defense orders and more extensive use of subcontracting.”



As I pointed out last month in The New International, such proposals coming from labor, although reactionary in their aim since they line up labor behind the imperialist war being fought by Churchill-Roosevelt, show that labor today can plan and organize production better than the bourgeoisie can.


The survey takes up at length the delicate question of strikes. It concludes that “friction” is bound to continue in future, since in most of the key war industries – steel, rubber, automobiles, oil, chemicals, etc. – the unions are young (post-1933) and in the midst of aggressive organizing campaigns.
 
It comes out against any outlawing of strikes or compulsory arbitration on the realistic grounds that past experience has shown that such measures just don’t work, that strikes go on just the same. “Strikes in democratic countries can be prevented only by agreement between employers and workers – not by law,” write the learned economists. This is true enough. But it doesn’t seem to occur to these wise men that, when and if the bosses have to choose between strikes and democracy on the one hand, and the survival of their system on the other, they will not choose ... strikes. This choice seems to be a long way off right now. The current strategy of the bosses, which this study of course reflects, is to go easy on labor, to retreat from the extreme measures which were being advocated in Congress five or six weeks ago. But labor shouldn’t deceive itself. This is not spring, but Indian summer, and the winter of fascism will surely come unless the workers fight with redoubled militancy in the future.

 



L. Hamburger
How Nazi Germany Has Mobilized and Controlled Labor
The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C., 63 pages, 25 cents
C.W. Guillebaud
The Social Policy of Nazi Germany
Macmillan and the Cambridge University Press. 134 pages, $1.25
Of these two little books on Hitler’s labor policies, the one that costs a quarter is very much better than the one that costs five times as much. In fact, Hamburger’s pamphlet is by all odds the best and most complete study of its subject I have seen. Despite the fact that it is put out by the ultra-conservative Brookings Institution, it approaches its theme from the point of view of the worker (something, as I shall show later, which Guillebaud’s book most distinctly does not do).
The theme of the Brookings pamphlet is stated on page one:
“The position of the workers has been transformed from that of substantial independence to a subservience more complete than that which existed under the feudal system of the Middle Ages.”
He elaborates the historical parallel later on:
“The ‘colonus’ of the later Roman Empire, the ‘serf’ of the Middle Ages, was considered part of the estate of his squire or lord. He was attached to, fixed on, the estate; he had no right to move away. He was, in the language of feudal law, ‘glebae adscriptus.’ Similarly the German worker has now become attached to, fixed on, his job – “glebae adscriptus” if it happened to be an agricultural one. or “factoriae adscriptus” (if one may say so) if it happened to be an industrial one.”
In a word, the free labor market has been abolished in Nazi Germany even more thoroughly than the free commodity market. Hamburger traces the processes in detail, giving each important regulation as it came along, and describing its effect on the workers of Germany, beginning with the compulsory mobilization of thousands of urban unemployed as “farm aids” under the decrees of March 3 and 11, 1933, and ending with measures of complete slavery which were instituted when the war began in 1939. He deals fully with the “work book,” the restrictions on freedom to change jobs, compulsory apprenticeship, the mobilization of women, youth, aged, Jews and criminals, and the compulsory shifting of hundreds of thousands of workers by the state authorities from one region to another, or from industry to another.
“Nazism has completely subjected the worker, in matters pertaining to employment, to a will foreign to his own,” writes Hamburger. “Such subjection is a servile concept. Under the Nazi regime, however, it is not the individual employer, it is the state which wields that will ... Hitler has built up, and successfully operates, a system of regimentation of labor, in scope and intensity such as the world has never seen.”
 
British “Fair Play”
C.W. Guillebaud is a professor of Cambridge University, England, and his booklet on the Nazis’ social policy was published over there this year. You might think that Prof. Guillebaud would be a little sharp with the Nazis, but you would be quite wrong. If you don’t look at the date, you would swear the book was written by a follower of the Cliveden Set [1] during the appeasement era. The author complains that “the war makes it doubly hard to maintain that objectivity which alone would make such a book worth writing or reading:” But he hasn’t let the war throw him off his balance – in fact, he leans so far to be “fair” to the Nazis that his book sounds like a paid ad for their system. And this in the second year of the war!
Guillebaud (who in 1938 performed the feat of publishing a book on The Economic Recovery of Germany, in which he hardly mentioned Hitler’s war policy) begins with a quotation from John De Courcy, leader of the arch-reactionary “Imperial Policy Group,” to the effect that in April 1939 any “unbiased” observer traveling in Germany had to recognize “a general contentment among the working classes.” Guillebaud says he agrees entirely with this. His book is essentially an attempt to explain this alleged fact by a thorough whitewashing of the Nazi labor policies. He has much good to say of the compulsory Labor Service, of the Winter Relief swindle, of Nazi housing (though he gently chides, “Here, as in many other (though not all) aspects of social policy, the promises of the National Socialists outran their performances”), and of the Labor Front.
All these basic characteristics of fascist labor policy, he sees as good. He does admit – in the most objective possible manner – that the Gestapo and the concentration camp are “a shame and a reproach to the new German order.” And he laments greatly that Hitler took it into his head to go to war, the implication being that the author would hove on the whole heartily approved the Nazi social policies had they been allowed to develop fully without being sacrificed to “the Moloch of preparation for war.” But, he adds with that wonderful British sense of fair play:
“It is but justice to recognize that the aims of social policy were kept continually in view and furthered as far as circumstances would permit. Nor is the record of the regime by any means devoid of achievement in that sphere.”
When you read a book like this, issued by a great English university at a time when England enters her death-struggle with Germany, certain things about the conduct of the war by the Churchill government and the deep silence on war aims become crystal clear. The Cliveden Set is no more, but Clivedenism is deep in the fibre of the British ruling class.

Fascism – A New Social Order
(May 1941)

From New International, Vol. VII No. 04, May 1941, pp. 82–85.
 Transcribed & marked up by Damon Maxwell for ETOL.
Proofread by Einde O’ Callaghan (December 2012)

IN DEVELOPING THE CONCEPTION of Nazism which I sketched in outline in The New International two months ago (and which the interested reader may find argued in more detail in the current issue of Partisan Review), I naturally have had many discussions with adherents of more “orthodox” views. These objections run pretty much along a few lines (most of which are laboriously traced out in Albert Gates’ article in the last New International). It seems useful, therefore, to try to formulate these objections in the form of five “hard questions,” and to try to deal with them briefly. [1] I hope that at least the answers may lay to rest certain elementary misconceptions about Nazi economics, as well as certain false assumptions as to the conclusions that one must “necessarily” draw if one insists that bureaucratic collectivism has displaced capitalism in Germany today.
 
Control Is Decisive
1. Has there been any trend towards greater nationalization (state ownership) of property under Hitler? If not, doesn’t this conflict with your theory?
Not only has there been no such trend, but the tendency has been in the other direction. “Reprivatisierung” (“reprivatizing”) was carried out by the Nazis on a big scale in 1936 and 1937. In this period, the state sold back to private interests its controlling shares (acquired in the last years of the Republic to prevent the bankruptcy of certain key banks and trusts) in Thyssen’s great steel trust, Vereinigte Stahlwerke; in the German Shipbuilding & Engineering Co.; in the Hamburg-South American Shipping Co.; and in the three big banks which dominated the whole banking system – the “Dedi” (Deutsche Bank & Disconto Gesellschaft), the Commerz und Privatbank, and the Dresdner. Yet this “reprivatizing,” which seems to support the traditional Marxist conception of the Nazi state, actually turns out to be a particularly nice example of the miscalculations one falls into if one takes too seriously the matter of private ownership in a totalitarian society, whether Nazi or Stalinist. By reprivatizing these banks and trusts, the Nazis gained (1) large sums of cash, (2) a certain amount of goodwill and confidence from the business community, which, in 1936 at least, still took these matters of “ownership” with Marxian seriousness. Both these commodities were useful to the Nazis, embarking on the Second Four Year Plan. In return, they gave nothing of importance. For note that they “restored” the properties not in 1934, when big business was still in the saddle, but in 1936-7, that is, after they had achieved such a degree of control of the economy that ownership had become a secondary matter. How secondary was to be revealed dramatically several years later when Fritz Thyssen, in 1936 restored by the Nazis to his full glory as the private owner of the Steel Trust, in 1939 fled across the border into exile.
Even more significant was the case of the Big Three banks. “There is no longer any question of private control,” commented the New York Times at the time. “All banks are now under the central control of the Reichsbank and the Economic Ministry, but the regime believes in private ownership so long as it does not involve the question of control.” Or, as Stolper put it in German Economy: “The subsequent reprivatizing of the large banks was of no practical consequence because meanwhile the state had assumed full control of the economic system as a whole.” At the same time as the Nazis reprivatized the Big Three banks, they also extended direct state control over the decisive factor in the banking system: the Reichs-bank, for so many years Dr. Schacht’s base of power. The New York Times of February 13, 1937, reported: “By a law decreed today, the Reichsbank was stripped of its technically independent character and placed under Chancellor Hitler’s direct authority as an organ of the German government.” A Marxist description of the German economy, written in 1936, had had this to say about the Reichsbank: “Schacht’s paramount economic power derives from the position of the Reichsbank, which is the most important economic institution in Germany. It has complete control of the capital market and of the main financial resources of the country. It forms a part of the Fascist state, yet it is – besides the Army – the only institution to which the Fascist totalitarian principle has not been applied.”
In his Fascism and Big Business, Guerin describes the change in ownership of the Big Three banks, which he, of course, sees as one more verification of the traditional Marxist thesis: but he does not even mention the much more significant change in control of the Reichsbank.
Could there be a clearer illustration of the misleading nature of the traditional Marxist categories than this matter of reprivatizing?
 
The Nature of Nazi Superiority
2. Is German fascism economically superior to democratic capitalism? If so, in what sense precisely?
The answer to the first question is Yes. Since 1936 Germany has been operating at practically 100 per cent capacity, with no unemployment and full use of the national plant. This production has been directed into the most necessary channel to any modern imperialist state: war production. The democracies have not produced at anything like 100 per cent and are not even now doing so, and their production is not even yet adequately integrated into the supreme purpose of a modern state – war. Furthermore, since 1936 we have seen Germany producing in quantity a whole series of synthetic products which hitherto modern industry had been able to produce only on a laboratory scale. Thus the German economy would seem to be dearly superior, in productivity and in technology, to the French, British and American economies.
The Marxist, however, asks: (1) is this increased production the result of new industrial techniques which exploit human labor more effectively, expressing themselves in higher productivity per man per hour – the sort of increased productivity which the industrial revolution at the end of the eighteenth century brought about? And (2) is this large-scale synthetic production due to new (post-Hitler) inventions and laboratory advances, comparable to the inventions of Watt, Arkwright, Whitney and other heroes of the industrial revolution? If the answer is Yes, then German fascism is a new form of economy in the sense that modern capitalism is, which is to say it is “progressive” in a Marxist sense. This does not seem to be the case, however. There is no significant difference, in this sense, between the German and the British or American forms of production. I have seen no figures indicating any superiority, in post-Hitler Germany, in man-hour productivity, nor is there any evidence that the new synthetic production, technologically, is anything more than an extension and application of discoveries made before 1933.
Wherein lies the superiority of Nazi economy may be suggested by Stolper’s comment on the production of synthetic materials: “The scientific and technical problems of their production were solved long before National Socialism came into power. The difficulty was merely the economic application of scientific devices on a large scale. This difficulty consisted first in the huge amounts of capital that had to be diverted to the new plants from other purposes, where they were employed more economically. The second difficulty was that these new materials were several times as expensive as the materials they were supposed to replace. For example, the price of Buna rubber is about seven times the price of genuine rubber.” That is, as I have shown above, it was desirable, for political reasons, for the Germany economy to cut loose from the world market and the international division of labor, since only thus could German supplies of essential war materials be assured. Laboratory technique gave the possibility of making artificial rubber, oil, wool, etc., on a big scale. But this ersatz production was so expensive and unprofitable – in terms of the world market – that business would never have undertaken it unless compelled to do so by the state. In a word, the problem of mass production of ersatz materials inside Germany was primarily a political, rather than an economic, problem, and the totalitarian controls wielded by the Nazis were what made a solution possible.
Similarly with the matter of production in general: the great problem of any advanced economy is not how to devise more efficient techniques for producing goods (technologically, we have been living in an economy of abundance, as against the i9th century economy of scarcity, for many years) but how to control the existing industrial mechanism so as to get it to work at full capacity on those products which are most desirable and useful for whatever aims the society may have. The problem is not how to increase productivity, but how to increase production, and the solution can be found only by political means. The Nazi economy is superior to those of England and America today in that it allows the state power to intervene so as to get 100 per cent production from the existing national plant and to organize this production in a planned, purposeful way. This can only be done by bursting the antiquated fetters which bourgeois economic forms place on production – and in this sense fascism is a kind of “black socialism.”
 
Fascism as a Class Society
3. If the Nazi is as you say it is, then will it not be able, in the future after the war, to introduce production for use, a planned economy, and plenty for all? In that case, what are the reasons for opposing it?
There is no economic reason why fascism should not create such a society after the war, and, by the same token, there is no economic reason for Marxists opposing it – any more than there was for their opposing the concentrating of industry into monopolistic trusts. But we don’t evaluate a society in terms of economic production alone; we also consider its effect on human beings. And here, as in the case of the trusts, there are good political reasons for fighting against fascism.
Fascism is not only a form of class society, but it is one in which the dominance of the ruling group and the exploitation of the ruled group reaches a degree of intensity unparalleled since the great slave states of antiquity. On a world scale, it means an Asiatic subjugation of all non-Germanic peoples to a German ruling race, just as internally it means the totalitarian control, by terror and propaganda, of the great mass of Germans by a political bureaucracy. This bureaucracy can maintain itself only by drawing an extremely sharp class line between themselves and the rest of society: absolute power must be counterposed to absolute subjugation. Hence, while it would be economically possible for fascism to develop into a sort of technocratic Utopia in which living standards would be high, politically this would tend to decrease the differences between rulers and ruled, since (1) access to and control of the means of production would have to be spread much more widely, and (2) such an economy would mean well-fed and well-housed masses, which in turn would mean leisure, education, a higher cultural level. Scarcity, hunger, ignorance – these are the necessary conditions for the maintenance of a totalitarian bureaucracy. As for conquered nations, the Nazis have already indicated the policy they must pursue there: not organization of their economies on a higher level, but, on the contrary, the de-industrialization of these nations, reduction of them as much as possible from advanced manufacturing nations to suppliers of foodstuffs and raw materials to a super-industrialized Germany. (Yes, Comrade Gates, there is “export of capital” – but to, not from, Germany!) Once more the relations inside Germany are reproduced on a world scale: in order to maintain absolute rule over conquered nations, the German state must concentrate the instruments of production in its own hands, keeping the rest of Europe on a subsistence level.
This is the most favorable possible outcome of the present war, for Germany. More likely is a continuance of the struggle with England for years, the entrance of the United States and possibly Russia into the conflict, and a long period – ten to twenty years – of continual or intermittent world conflict between Germany and her major imperialist rivals. In such a case, it would dearly be even less likely that the Nazi bureaucracy would relax any of its control over either the German masses or the European conquered nations or that we would see any technocratic era of plenty ushered in by fascism.
The distinction between the two outcomes is not very important anyway, since the first would merely postpone for a few years the struggle for world power between Germany and the United States. So even in that case, there could be little relaxation of the present “war economy.”
 
The New Ruling Group
4. How can Germany be termed a non-capitalist society when (1) the bourgeoisie still retain their property, still amass huge profits; (2) the bourgeoisie also keep their social status largely intact, living better than the rest of society and occupying positions of authority; (3) this alleged new ruling class, the bureaucracy, is just a handful of politicians with the same essential relationship to the means of production as politicians in capitalist countries?
Even traditional Marxists would agree that you have in Germany two economic systems existing side by side the familiar capitalist system with its apparatus of prices, profits, private property, money, the market, etc.; and a new sort of system, which might be called bureaucratic collectivism, in which production is ordered not by the interplay of capitalist factors but by official decrees and regulations based on a plan worked out consciously by state bureaucrats. The same dualism exists in this country today: the diehard Republicans are right when they detect in various New Deal measures (SEC, TVA, Wages and Hours Act, Wagner Act, AAA, RFC, FCC, FDIC) a non-capitalist tendency. The question is: which of these systems is dominant? My contention is that, while clearly it is the first in this country, in Germany it is the second. While the forms of capitalism still exist there, they have lost their autonomy and hence their character of economic prime-movers, and have become merely the technical bookkeeping means whereby the plans of the bureaucracy are put into effect.
(2) It is true that the bourgeoisie have not been reduced to the level of the working class either in power or in living standards – to put it mildly. There is some disagreement as to just how much the bourgeoisie’s living standards have been reduced, but it seems probable that their living standards are still far above those of the masses and that there still is a considerable degree of luxury open to them. It is also true that they exert a much greater degree of influence on the Nazi regime than any other of the old social classes do, and that many Nazi top bureaucrats have also become members of the bourgeoisie through acquisition of property. But these are not decisive tests of class rule. The position of the German big bourgeoisie in relation to the Nazi bureaucracy has resemblances to the relationship, centuries ago, between the feudal nobility and the new bourgeois ruling class. The feudal nobles were by no means reduced to the status of their peasants by the bourgeois revolution; in England especially, they kept much of their wealth and were able to fuse themselves with the new ruling class. But this did not alter the fact that they were no longer the ruling class in society. When one form of class rule succeeds another, the new ruling class often treats the old one with more consideration than the masses get. This is partly due to snobbery, but chiefly to the common interest both classes have in keeping the great mass of people out of power (the old ruling class, in the transition period, still commands some of the instruments of control) . It is only when a revolution is made by believers in a classless society, leading the lowest of the old classes, as in Russia, that the break with the old ruling class is sudden and complete.
(3) Finally, the new ruling class in Germany is by no means “just a handful of politicians.” Guerin describes it: “A caste of parasites, greedy and corrupt, was installed in the government. An idea of its numerical size can be obtained from the fact that at the Nuremburg Congress every year the parade of party leaders alone included nearly a million participants.” It is true that because of its hierarchical and centralized form of organization, the class is itself controlled at the top by a small number of political leaders. But the entire mass, from Hitler down to the humblest youth leader, has a common interest in the perpetuation of the party’s monopoly of power, derives a common economic security from its privileged status, and has a common sense of superiority, prestige and real power vis-à-vis the ‘grey mass’ of non-party people. Nor is it accurate to describe this political organization as essentially a reproduction, on a bigger scale, of capitalist political parties. These new rulers of society, like the bourgeoisie, rule because they have control of the means of production. It is true that this control is exercised in a different form from that of the capitalist ruling class, that it is based on political power over the means of production rather than on legal ownership of them. But the relationship of the Nazi bureaucracy to the means of production is that of a ruling class, in the strictest Marxist sense. [2] Sidney Hook well summarized the matter when he wrote in the New Leader of July 20: “If we follow the customary usage of scientific historians, the term “social revolution” will designate (1) a change in property relations, (2) effected by a transfer of political power from one class to another. Once we define property functionally, i.e., as the right, enforced by state power, to exclude others from the use of goods and services, then it is strictly accurate to say that in Germany (as in Russia) the basic instruments of production are owned by the party bureaucracy.” [3]
 
The Character of the Order
5. But why isn’t it “just a war economy,” a long-term in-vestment by the German big bourgeoisie?
By now almost every one grants the existence of certain non-capitalist features at least at present in the Germany economy. The theory of “just a war economy” or “a long-term investment by the bourgeoisie in future profits to be realized after the war” implies that these tendencies, however non-capitalist, are merely temporary, that after the war is over assuming a German victory – there will be a return to more “normal” capitalist economic and political methods. [4] This in turn implies a belief in the possibility of the reconstruction of the world market – with Germany in England’s place – and in the possibility that capitalism – failing as a successful socialist or colonial revolutionary movement – can survive this war. With these assumptions I disagree.
For my views on the world market and Germany’s war aims, I must again refer the reader to the current Partisan Review. Here I want to make a few points about the internal political situation in Germany today.
In a recent lecture, Shachtman made a notable admission: that today in Germany the bourgeoisie no longer control politically the Nazi bureaucracy, that they have for the moment lost (or surrendered) their political power – while, of course, still keeping their ownership of the means of production. At first glance, this seems to contradict the usual Marxist view of the state power as “the executive committee of the bourgeoisie.” For here we have a state power which makes political decisions independently of the bourgeoisie, who thus become pensioners of the state power, enjoying economic benefits only insofar and for so long a time as seems best to the bureaucracy to grant them. In answering a question pointing this out, Shachtman made two points: (1) Nazism is a species of Bonapartism, in which the state power temporarily assumes an independence from direct control by the ruling class; (2) as Engels pointed out, the development of finance capital long ago turned the bourgeoisie into a caste of superfluous, parasitic coupon-clippers, who no longer play an important role in production (as the early capitalist entrepreneurs did, who personally directed production, built up new industries) but who have become rentiers drawing “pensions” from the stocks and bonds which are their legal titles to the income from production.
To deal with (2) first: in the pre-fascist era the bourgeoisie controlled the state politically, and it was precisely the most important function of the state power to protect these pensioners’ property rights to the lion’s share in the income from production; under fascism, the state power has become politically independent of the bourgeoisie. Parasitic pensioners from the economic point of view in both instances, the big bourgeoisie in the one case controlled the political instrument which could guarantee their legal rights to their pensions, in the other case lost this control. Thus we come back once more to the central point, which traditional Marxists seem unable to grasp: that it is political control, and not legal ownership which is decisive.
Shachtman’s second point, that this is an essentially Bonapartist regime (admittedly a much more stable kind than has ever existed before), means that after the war the bourgeoisie will regain their political control of the state. What form, precisely, could this take? I can imagine only two – either a restoration of some degree of democracy or else a “palace revolution,” perhaps aided by the conservative army chiefs, which would replace fascist-quasi-Bonapartism with the pre-Hitler type of Bonapartism. But the latter would merely postpone the decision, since it is generally agreed that this type, purely and frankly a “rule of the saber,” cannot last any considerable period. Thus the general perspective must be a trend back towards democracy – which is, after all, the political form best suited to a capitalist market economy. I think this trend is unlikely for both political and economic reasons. Politically, why should the Nazi bureaucracy, which has won the war by its own methods and its own policies, both of which were strongly opposed by the big bourgeoisie, as I have shown, why should this triumphant class step aside and let the bourgeoisie take command again? And, assuming the Nazis would not yield voluntarily, how could the bourgeoisie engineer a palace revolution when the bureaucracy, having reduced to political impotence the junkers, the finance capitalists and the conservative army clique, is firmly in control of the whole state apparatus? Economically, the shift is even less likely, since, as I have tried to show, Nazi bureaucratic collectivism has won out over Schacht’s capitalist policies because it more closely corresponds to the structure of Germany’s highly rationalized, large-scale industrial economy. It is precisely the failure of the political-economic forms expressing finance capitalism – from the Bruning-Schleicher-Papen types of Bonapartism through Schacht’s “New Plan” – to solve Germany’s economic problems that made inevitable the establishment of the Second Four Year Plan and the victory of the Nazi bureaucratic forms. But will these difficulties be more or less serious after the war? If less, then there is at least a theoretical possibility of the relaxation of totalitarian controls. If more, there is not even such a theoretical possibility.
The crux of the whole matter is the possibility of the survival of capitalism throughout the next period of world war, and of the reconstitution, after the war, of the world market and an international capitalist economy. My views on this subject are expressed in detail in the current Partisan Review. It cannot be too often emphasized that the perspective of “orthodox” Marxists like Gates, Shachtman and most of the other leaders of the Workers Party is based on the assumption that, at some time in the future, with peace, there will be a tendency back to a more “normal” capitalism, that the bourgeoisie will take back the state from the “Bonapartist” totalitarians, and that it will be economically possible to restore something at least approaching the traditional capitalist world market. For my own part, I cannot share this faith in the recuperative powers of capitalism. I am much less optimistic about its survival!

Notes
1. In these questions I do not deal with perhaps the main point raised by Albert Gates: that inside Germany you have monopoly capitalism, and outside Germany the struggle of a “state capitalist” imperialism for a bigger share o! the world market. This is because in my article, The Economics of Nazism, in the current Partisan Review it chances that I deal extensively with these themes. Comrade Gates would have been well advised to restrain his polemical ardor until he had read this article!
2. In an article, Is Russia a Workers’ State? in The New International for December 1940, Max Shachtman argues that, while the Stalinist bureaucracy is a new class, the Hitler bureaucracy is not. He rests his entire argument on the purely formalistic quibble that in Germany you have private property forms, and in Russia you have collectivized property forms. The heart of Shachtman’s argument is this paragraph: “Private ownership of capital, that ‘juridical detail’ before which Hitler comes to a halt, is a social reality of the profoundest importance. With all its political power, the Nazi bureaucracy remains a bureaucracy; sections of it fuse with the bourgeoisie, but as a social aggregation it is not developing into a new class. Here control of the state power is not enough. The bureaucracy, insofar as its development into a new class with a new class rule of its own is concerned, is itself controlled by the objective reality of the private ownership of capital.” In this article I have tried to present data to show that, under Nazism as under Stalinism, “control of the state power” is “enough,” and that these private property forms are precisely – forms. Elsewhere in his article, Shachtman makes a valid distinction between property forms and property relations. The conclusion he reaches as to the nature of the Soviet economy applies word for word to the Nazi economy, as may be demonstrated by substituting the word “private” for “nationalized” and “Germany” for “the Soviet Union” – to wit: “However, what is crucial are not the property forms, i.e., nationalized [private] property, whose existence cannot be denied, but precisely the relations of the various social groups in the Soviet Union [Germany] to this property, i.e., property relations! [“!” indeed!]. If we can speak of nationalized [private] property, in the Soviet Union [Germany], this does not yet establish what the property relations are.” Thus we find Shachtman, in writing of Soviet economy, basing his conclusion on the property relations, correctly rejecting the property forms as secondary, while in defining the Nazi economy, he looks only at the property forms, which are those of private property, without considering, as this article tries to do, “the relations of the various social groups to this property.” To such shifts is the “orthodox” Marxist reduced today when he tries to escape the embarrassing – to his theory – implications of fascist economics.
3. It might be well to point out that, in agreeing with Hook’s formulation on this point, I do not at all agree with his general political conclusions as to the desirability of supporting England against Germany in this war – any more than, in accepting Hilferding’s analysis of totalitarian economics, I accept his well known general political views. As the Persian proverb has it: “A wise man gathers knowledge even out of the mouths of unbelievers.”
4. It is interesting to note that the two schools of thought which held this “long-term investment” theory most tenaciously were the conservative-bourgeois and the traditional-Marxist. Schacht and Trotsky both emphasized the fact that the big bourgeoisie was only yielding its control to the Nazis for the time being, that its concessions and sacrifices would be more than restored “after the war.” Schacht and the big bourgeoisie, being actually involved in the development of Nazism, have been the first to lose this illusion. The Marxists, looking on at a distance, have been able to remain blind to the reality even up to the present. This parallelism between Marxist and conservative-bourgeois thought, by the way, cannot be dismissed an as “amalgam,” since it can be shown that the thought-patterns are the same in each case because both schools of thought analyze economic relations in Germany within a capitalist framework, the Marxists putting a moral plus sign where the bourgeoisie put a moral minus sign.

The American War Economy
Where Are We? What Lies Ahead?
(April 1941)

From New International, Vol.VII No.03, April 1941, pp. 40–46.
 Transcribed & marked up by Damon Maxwell for ETOL.

WHEN WE LOOK ABOUT US and see the speed with which a war economy is coming into being – the billions appropriated by Congress, the feverish building of industrial plants and army camps and power dams, the headlines about steel profits and new records in shipbuilding and anti-strike legislation – It is hard to believe we are just at the beginning of the road to a modern war economy. Yet such is the case.
Today in both Germany and England six out of every ten working hours are devoted to production for the war machine, leaving only four hours for all the needs of the civilian population. Today in the United States only thirty minutes out of every ten working hours goes for war goods, and even by midsummer, when the program is expected to be in “full swing,” only about one hour and fifteen minutes out of every ten working hours will go for war. According to Commerce Reports for March 8, 1941, the German government is now absorbing – mostly, of course, for military purposes – the incredible total of 72 of the entire national income. Estimates are that the American government will spend this year about $23 billions for all purposes, which is about 25 of the national income. Even allowing for the fact that America has a much bigger productive plant than Germany and hence can produce as much with a smaller percentage of national income, it is plain we are only at the start of the road to an all-out war effort.
This article tries to estimate how far we have gone and in what direction, from the point of view of the working class, we are going. It may be useful to begin by setting out the line of argument. This can be put, briefly, thus:

American war production is increasing rapidly, but has fallen far behind the planned expansion. The bourgeoisie are currently much concerned about this.
 
The explanation is not in “defense strikes,” but in the conflict between the immediate profit and property interests of the bourgeoisie and the measures that must be taken to prepare for war (i.e., to protect their long-range economic interests). The bourgeoisie have shown little ability to subordinate the former to the latter and hence are unable to organize an effective war economy.
 
American labor has put forward the boldest and most intelligent proposals for organizing war production – the Reuther and C.I.O. plans. Politically reactionary, these are nonetheless impressive evidence of the bankruptcy of the present ruling class and the social maturity of the working class.
 
All classes of American society are at present enjoying, in different degrees, the benefits of the growing war economy, without as yet experiencing the disadvantages.
 
The Roosevelt Administration last summer talked of expanding both war production and civilian consumption at the same time – of an economy of “guns and butter.” This program could have succeeded only with an enormous plant expansion by American industry. This expansion, for good business reasons, industry refused to make, nor was the Administration either willing or able to force them to make it.
 
Hence the war economy now taking shape is to be an economy of guns instead of butter. Even New Dealers now admit this.
 
To business this means at present export controls and priorities, the thin edge of the wedge of state control.
 
To the masses this will mean in the near future an increasing diversion of their purchasing power into war channels, and thus lower living standards. The government will engineer this both “voluntarily” through baby bond and war-savings-stamps campaigns, and forcibly, through taxation, “compulsory savings” schemes, and finally direct rationing.
 
We are still a good distance away from the “crisis point” in the development of our war economy, when the imposition of totalitarian state controls will become not only desirable but necessary. This point will come when a state of full production and employment is reached, at which point only totalitarian controls can avert a runaway price inflation. This point may be reached in the summer of 1942.
 
The Roosevelt Administration is already well prepared with plans for total economic and social controls in future. But actually to put them into effect may be politically difficult, if not impossible. The question is: can totalitarianism be imposed wholly from above, administratively, as “white” or “cold” fascism?
 
The answer to that question will be found chiefly in the ability of the American working class to put forward the revolutionary socialist alternative to Roosevelt’s “white fascism” (and Hitler’s “black” fascism).
 

1. How Effective Is the War Production Program?
There are two parts to the Administration’s arms program: the creation of a powerful American war machine, and aid to England. For the first, Roosevelt’s latest proposal, which will probably have passed through Congress by the time this is printed, calls for the spending of $28 billions in the next three years. For the second, now moving into high gear with the passing of the Lend-Lease bill, there is not definite amount specified. An idea of the enormous expenditures planned for both these purposes plus the regular expenses of the government is given by the U. S. News (March 28) estimate of the total government spending in the single fiscal year that will begin next July 1: namely, $23 billions, or almost three times the 1939 government budget.
War Production Higher But Far Short of Plans
So far the most successful part of the program has been the speed with which Roosevelt has proposed and Congress voted ever huger appropriations. If voting the money were the problem, the United States would be in a position to invade the Continent tomorrow and occupy Berlin in a week. But – as the Nazis have understood for a long time and as the democracies are beginning to learn now – money is one thing, production another. It is true that there has been a rapid rise in the volume of actual arms expenditures (as against appropriations) in the last few months, as the following table shows:



July, 1940


 


$177 Millions




September


$200 Millions




November


$300 Millions




December


$473 Millions




January, 1941


$572 Millions




February


$592 Millions



But this table also shows that the rate of increase, though rapid, has been much less than planned. For the current fiscal year (ending June 30) a total of $6,500,000,000 was allocated for the war program. Two-thirds of the year has gone by and over half ($3,600,000,000) of that amount remains unspent. To fulfill the budget schedule, spending in the remaining four months would have to be at the rate of $900 millions a month – that is, the March total would have to jump about 80% over February and this rate of increase would have to be maintained. This seems clearly out of the question. As the table shows, the rate of expansion has been slowing down in an alarming (to some people) way of late: December was 57% over November, but January was only 21% over December, while February scored only a negligible (3.5%) gain over January.
Aid to England has also slowed down of late. Last August shipments to England totalled $125,000,000. By December they had declined to $101,000,000. As for the vital supply of American planes, the New Leader of December 7, 1940, sadly noted: “Even the most optimistic in Washington do not see how we can hit the scheduled 1,500 planes a month before 1942 ... Even at that time, we will only be able to turn over 750 planes a month to Britain, while German production stays at a 2300 a month level.”
This failure of American war production precisely at the point when the war approaches a Spring crisis, when Britain’s position may become desperate at any moment, and the German attack on British shipping is reaching new highs – this is naturally very disturbing to official Washington. Ex-Ambassador Bullitt, frequently a White House mouthpiece, said recently:
We know that our country is not producing weapons of defense fast enough and that we are not supplying weapons in sufficient quantities to the British, the Chinese and the Greeks ... We have not lived up to our tradition of American enterprise and industrial efficiency ... We are making just the effort that it is not troublesome to make. We could double our planned output of airplanes and tanks and merchant ships and guns in 1942 if we would but buckle to the task now. – (Time, March 10)
 
Why, Oh Why, Can’t We Produce?
This pathetic lament is typical of recent bourgeois comment on the war program. Also typically, Bullitt blamed it all on the isolationists and the communists. The most popular scapegoat, of course, is labor. The nation’s press has launched a campaign to get strikes “outlawed” and unions put under strict government control. Strikes in “defense industries” are played up prominently on the front page: reactionary Congressmen make the welkin ring with their cries of “treason” and “sabotage.” In a letter to the N.Y. Times dated March 6, Secretary Perkins gave some cold facts from the Bureau of Labor Statistics: (1) “Strikes in defense industries in 1940 resulted in lost time equal to only one-fourth of 1 per cent of the total defense effort”; (2) the average duration of defense strikes last year was 8 days, of non-defense strikes, 20 days; (3) “From September, 1940, through January, 1941, the number of man-days of idleness because of strikes has been 27 per cent less than it was year before ... The average number of days per strikes in January was 9.6 days as compared with an average of 16.6 days per strike in January in the five year 1935–1939.” [1]
No, it’s not in this direction that the explanation will be found for the lag in arms production, and the reactionaries who are now campaigning for stricter controls over labor will find, if they put their program through, that they have solved nothing. The roots of the problem lie much deeper: in the conflict between capitalist profit and property interests and the demands of a modern total war economy.
 
The Situation in Aircraft
Consider, for example, the vital aircraft industry. At the end of December, Knudsen admitted that plane production was 30 behind schedule. This was conservative. In August Knudsen had stated that military planes were then being turned out at the rate of 11,000 a year, and had predicted that by January 1941 the annual rate would be 18,000. But when that time came, practically no increase had been registered: 1,002 military planes were produced in January, which is at the rate of slightly over 12,000 a year. Other evidence could be cited: the fiasco, just beginning to leak out, of the Allison water-cooled engine; Admiral Towers’ recent testimony that the present serious shortage of engines for Navy planes would last until the summer of 1942; Knudsen’s announcement last October that the automobile industry would turn out 12,000 planes for Britain in a few months and his revision of the figure, several months later, to 3,600 – with the first of them not scheduled to come off the assembly lines until 1942.
What is behind this? The only important strike to date in aircraft was the Vultee strike, and not even Congressman Dies could blame it all on that. What is involved here, as in similar situations in other war industries, is the determination of the private companies, on the one hand, to protect their profits and their plant investment, and the inability (and unwillingness) of the Government to take the necessary steps (involving administrative invasion of legal property rights) to force planned and maximum production. It was the aircraft companies which led the sit-down strike of business last summer which forced through Congress the kind of excess-profits bill they wanted: they simply refused to sign contracts until their terms were met. Similarly, for months the plane companies insisted, despite Washington pressure, on filling all the extremely profitable orders from commercial airlines they could get, and it was only the exercise of priority power by the Defense Commission recently that finally forced them to give military planes the right of way. And it was pressure from the plane companies which as much as anything killed the Reuther plan for mass production of planes in idle automobile factories by the automobile industry (of which more later). Any radical change in production methods – such as the Reuther proposal – would, of course, render obsolete much of the present plant investment of the aircraft industry.
 
2. The Working Class Alone Can Plan
The pattern is the same in other industries as in aircraft: the logic of their immediate profit interests leads the bourgeoisie to sabotage the war program designed to defend their long-range economic interests. It is a little more complicated than that, however. The control and planning on a national scale which are the heart of war economy today, these are a new road for capitalism, ending God knows where, from which the bourgeoisie shrink back. So we find that the only class whose social interests are broad enough to allow it to think on the national planned scale required by a modern war economy is the working class, and we see, in England first and now in America, the supreme paradox, the irony of ironies – the working class showing more ability to create an effective economy to wage imperialist war than the ruling class itself. This suggests, I might add, how enormously more effectively a working class, socialist government could prosecute a war against Hitler.
It is the C.I.O. which has put forward the two boldest and most far-reaching plans for reorganizing the war program: the Reuther Plan and the C.I.O. proposal for industrial councils (specifically worked out in Murray’s plan for the steel industry). These plans – and their fate – deserve a bit of attention at this point.
 
The Reuther Plan
The Reuther Plan, as most people know, is based on the fact that, because of the seasonal nature of automobile production, the vast resources of the industry in machine tools, plants and skilled workers are idle, on a year-round basis, half the time. Reuther proposed to use these idle men and machines to build a standardized pursuit plane with mass production methods at the rate of 500 a day, or 150,000 a year. He claimed that this figure could be reached within six months. (Today, more than six months after the Reuther Plan was first proposed to the Administration, plane production is at the rate of 12,000 a year.) This could only be done, of course, by treating the entire auto-mobile industry as a single vast productive mechanism, planning and coordinating without any regard for existing corporate lines, competition, or property rights. The necessary authority to do this Reuther proposed to vest in a nine-man board, equally divided between labor, management and government.
The plan was at once greeted with a barrage of technological criticism from both the auto and the aviation industries. To the layman, these criticisms are not very convincing – and, furthermore, there is the fact that much of what Reuther proposed is now being done, on a small scale and with the proper safeguards to property interests, by the automobile industry. The real objections of both industries to the plan were not stated in public, since they involved the delicate matter of profits and property. The aircraft companies were against the plan because (1) they would lose business; (2) introduction of mass production would make worthless most of their present plant investment; (3) the relatively small aircraft companies would go to the wall once the huge and wealthy automobile companies entered their field. The automobile companies opposed the plan because (1) they would lose considerable managerial control over their business to a board composed mostly of government and labor representatives; (2) even if the board were “satisfactory” to the companies, the entire present structure of private ownership in the industry would be shattered (and might be difficult to restore later on, if the plan worked); (3) the plan, although in theory it would not interfere with normal automobile production, actually would involve such a drastic reorganization of the industry that production of cars undoubtedly would suffer, at least at first – and this premises to be the most profitable year the industry has had in a decade. Beyond all these objections was also the simple fact that the plan was proposed by labor. What would the public think if the C.I.O. turned out to know more about their industry than the automobile moguls themselves?
The reception the Reuther Plan got from the Administration was rather chilly. Far from being patted on the head and called a bright boy for showing papa how to win the war, Reuther never even got a serious hearing. He laid his plan before Hillman last August, who spoke to Knudsen, who has done and said nothing about the plan since then. On December 22, no doubt a little impatient, Murray of the C.I.O. made the plan public, discussing it with Roosevelt the next day. (“No commitment either for or against was made by the President,” reported the Times.) There followed a round of conferences with Washington officials, some radio speeches by Reuther, and then the plan seemed to quietly expire.
 
The C.I.O. Industrial Council Plan
Similar in essentials is the story of the C.I.O. Plan for setting up councils, with labor, management and government represented on each, to plan war production in each industry. The aim was to draw into war production the thousands of smaller companies that so far have been left out in the cold. Murray claimed that “out of 10,000 manufacturing establishments capable of providing defense materials, only 30 have received government contracts.” From the standpoint of production, this is bad. From labor’s viewpoint, it is bad also, since workers have to eat whether they work for big or little businessmen. Murray also presented a special plan for steel, based on the experiences of the S.W.O.C. “Large steel firms are overloaded with orders,” he stated, “while smaller steel firms are operating as little as 45% of capacity.” In these plans the C.I.O. put its finger on what is more and more coming to be recognized as a major weakness of the present war economy: that, following the line of least resistance, the O.P.M. has allocated orders mostly to the biggest companies, leaving untapped the collectively vast productive facilities of thousands of small firms. The C.I.O. plan would spread out control both geographically (away from Washington, into each industry) and socially (labor representatives), thus making possible a more even distribution of war orders. The objections to the C.I.O. Plan were of the same order as those to the Reuther Plan, and have proven equally decisive. [2]
 
The Parallel with England
The significance of the Reuther and C.I.O. plans is enormous, especially when one considers how closely the American experience parallels the British in this war. The British bourgeoisie has also been revealed by the stern test of war to be bankrupt as a ruling class. Not until the Labor Party entered the government last spring was there even the beginning of a serious war effort, nor was it accidental that in that first crisis cabinet the three key economic posts were given to labor politicians: Dalton in Economic Warfare, Morrison in Supply, and Bevin in Labor. What is the meaning of these unprecedented developments – the working class not merely passively submitting to the bourgeois war machine – as in the last war – but actually showing a greater boldness and grasp of how to run it than the bourgeoisie themselves? The explanation, I think, is that (1) the economic problems of waging war in 1914–1918, staggering though they were compared to anything that had been known up to then, were relatively simple and could hence be solved with a relatively mild reshaping of peacetime capitalism, as compared to the problems that must be met and the revamping of the peacetime economy that must be made in contemporary warfare; (2) capitalism today is incomparably more decadent and literally unworkable as an economic system than it was in 1914–1918, so that the bourgeoisie simply make a terrible hash of things when they try to function in the old ways. The working class thus has today an unparalleled opportunity to take the power that is slipping from the grasp of a dying ruling class – as, for that matter, have the fascist demagogues. The great tragedy of our period up to now has been that the reformist leaders of the working class in England and America have done all they could not to take the power so lightly held by the bourgeoisie. Labor “leaders” like Bevin and Morrison and Murray and Green are thrusting the working class back into the house of democratic capitalism just as the whole structure is collapsing.
Thus the actual effect (as against its symptomatic significance) of the intervention of labor into the organization of the war economy has been merely to tie the workers to the wheels of the imperialist war chariot, since this intervention is made without first securing control of the state by revolutionary action. It has not even strengthened labor’s bargaining power within the capitalist system: the Labour party chiefs have steadily lost power to Churchill’s Tories in England since last May, while the shift of the Roosevelt Administration to the right in the last few months needs no underlining. Nor has labor’s intervention, under these conditions, been very effective even technically. The reformist politics of labor bureaucrats like Bevin, Reuther and Murray, their timid refusal to call into action the working class – little effort was made to bring to bear on the Administration rank-and-file working-class pressure for the Reuther Plan, for example; its fate was decided entirely in conferences with top government officials – have made it possible for the bourgeoisie to use labor’s economic plans only to the extent they think is absolutely necessary for national survival. Thus Knudsen has put into effect the automotive-aircraft tieup advocated by Reuther and the spreading of war production advocated by Murray – but only in a crippled, small-scale form, safely within the bounds of private enterprises. Churchill has likewise taken care to sabotage the more “extreme” (i.e., effective) features of the labor politicians’ economic plans, so that even today the British war economy is far from maximum efficiency. It should be clearer than ever today that working class planning can be fully effective, whether for peace or war, only within a working-class socialist political system.
 
3. The Road Ahead for the U.S. War Economy
At present all classes of American society are enjoying the benefits of war economy without, as yet, feeling very seriously the disadvantages. This is because the government is injecting into the national economic system sums which make the New Deal’s peacetime pump-priming efforts look picayune: $23 billions of government spending a year means boom times on a 1929 scale. On the other hand, the Administration has, so far, refrained as much as possible from applying those controls over the property of the bourgeoisie and the consumption of the masses which will become increasingly necessary as war production develops. So for the present, every one is happy, the precise degree of happiness being related to the particular rung of the economic ladder one happens to occupy. Big business is, naturally, happiest: last year the average yield of all stocks on the N.Y. Stock Exchange was 5.7%, highest since 1932, and more dividends were paid out to stockholders than in any year since 1937. The middle classes also have cause for rejoicing. Their consumption has so far been greatly increased by the war boom: automobile production last year was the biggest in four years, and production schedules are set for another 1,500,000 vehicles in the second quarter of this year: there is a home-building boom on, with residential building contracts for February 56% ahead of last year; current department store sales are up 19% over last year. (These figures, by the way, indicate how far we are from even the beginnings of the sort of war economy Germany has had since 1936.) Even the working class is sharing in the boom, in its modest way: it is expected that by the end of the year the present 7,000,000-odd unemployed will be reduced by half.
 
The Incompatibility of Guns and Butter
But there is something uneasy and foreboding about this prosperity. The middle classes and workers see rationing and lower living standards ahead. Wall Street, too, is uneasy, as is shown by the lack of activity on the Stock-Exchange and the failure of stock prices to rise despite huge earnings. Here an important point must be made: that the immediate economic interests of the bourgeoisie and the masses are to some extent similar. That is, the business man wants to fill both Government war orders and also the civilian orders which are pouring in as a result of the general stimulus to the economy by the huge government spending; even though he makes more on a government order – which is not always the case – a businessman, with an eye to after the war, wants to fill the orders of his private customers as much as possible. “Business as usual” is his dream, which means that civilian consumption would be allowed to rise as high as the war boom would take it. Thus the question might be asked: since everybody, including the liberal weeklies, want a war economy of guns and butter, why isn’t this what we are going to get?
Before answering this question, we should understand clearly that this is not what we are going to get. The turn away from butter, in fact, is already in process. “When the defense program was first undertaken, the general policy was to superimpose it on the normal requirements for the civilian population ... The defense program has now, however, passed into its second stage. It can no longer be superimposed ... If it is possible to produce what we need and still take care of our business as usual, that, of course, is what I want to do; but we must have the defense material regardless.” (Donald M. Nelson, leading O.P.M. official, as quoted in Time, Jan. 27, 1941.) Last summer, Roosevelt declared cheerfully that the nation need not be “discomboomerated” by the war program, that business could proceed “as usual” and the people could have more and not less butter. In this as in other matters, events have made a liar out of our President. The conservative U.S. News for March 7 sums up the trend thus:
When the defense program was launched, official plans centered on a policy of providing the American people with both guns and butter. With idle plant and millions of unemployed, the opinion was widely held that defense requirements, superimposed on non-defense output, would lead the country to full employment and provide adequate arms without sacrificing living standards. “Business as usual” was not to be too greatly interrupted.
This theory has now broken on hard production facts. However much defense plant expands, officials now recognize that more government supervision is necessary to keep defense industries operating at peak. A gradual broadening of priority orders issued from O.P.M. is now viewed as inevitable.
The only way that the liberal-reformist program of guns and butter could have been put into effect would have been by an expansion of productive capacity large enough to supply both war and civilian needs. [3] But business doesn’t want to expand too much, because it is better to make a good profit on orders piled up months and even years ahead than to build new plants and risk being caught with ruinous amounts of excess capacity after the war boom is over. Thus we find the same pattern repeated throughout American industry in recent months. Several weeks ago the Federal Power Commission predicted a serious shortage of power for war industries “if power needs continue to be underestimated by the utilities as they have been in recent months.” The railroads, under pressure by the Administration to increase their rolling stock so as to handle the heavy volume of traffic expected in future, have steadily rejected the suggestion as “public hysteria.” A similar battle has been going on between New Dealers, who want greatly expanded steel production, and the big steel companies, who don’t. Roosevelt has finally settled the dispute in favor of the companies on the basis of a report by the conservative engineer, Gano Dunn. (And already business publications admit it will soon be necessary to apply priorities to steel.) The machine tool industry, one of the two worst bottlenecks in war production, has doubled its production in a year without making any significant additions to its plant – preferring to pile up huge back-logs of future orders and ration its customers. So too with aluminum, the other bad bottleneck, where the monopolistic Mellon-owned Aluminum Co. of America (backed by the dollar-a-year men on the Defense Commission) for months insisted there was plenty of aluminum for both civil and military needs – until, last fall, the shortage became so acute that priorities had to be applied by the government.
The pattern has been the same in every big industry: a quite understandable reluctance by business to sink capital in plants which may later on be excess capacity (and tend to drive down prices), and an equally understandable reluctance on the part of the Roosevelt Administration to take the drastic steps (planning, centralized control, government-owned plants) which would be necessary to expand industrial capacity to the point where it could supply both military and civilian demands. This was Mr. Nelson’s “first stage” of the war program, and the battle was won in every case by business. And so, since plant capacity is not enough to supply both guns and butter, the choice has had to be made for guns – which is the “second stage” we are now entering into. For the masses, this means, in the future, rationing (of this, more later). For industry it means, beginning now, increasing priority control by the government – that is, the rationing of scarce commodities like aluminum or nickel among industrial consumer on the basis of which industry is decided to be more essential to the war program, and hence entitled to “prior” call on the rationed commodities. And the decisions are made by the government bureaucracy (sweetened with dollar-a-year men) and are enforced by Federal law.
 
Priorities for Business
Business, naturally, doesn’t much like this invasion of its property rights either, but it chose it quite deliberately as a preferable alternative to plant expansion. (“Industry faced the problem of priorities with its eyes open,” comments one business paper.) But a lesser evil is nonetheless an evil. The explanation of the strange apathy of the stock market despite the huge profits being made today and despite the more than sympathetic attitude of the Roosevelt Administration, is to be found in the steady growth of governmental controls over business since the Nazi Blitzkrieg last Spring. (That the controls are mostly administered by sound business men – and not by New Dealers – softens the blow; but it all means, nevertheless, entering into a strange and perilous new economic world.) This growth has not yet been pushed by Roosevelt, who on the contrary has shown every desire to avoid “discomboomerating” American business. Like Caesar, he has thrice put aside the crown – and, like Caesar, he seems fated to wear it all the same. For the requirements of the war program are pushing American capitalism with an irresistible logic into the harness of state control.
As in Germany, the first steps towards total Wehrwirtschaft began in the field of foreign trade. Last June Roosevelt put an embargo on the export of machine tools, following this up a month later with an order requiring governmental licenses for the export of “any munitions, materials, or machinery needed in the national defense program.” On October 22, Roosevelt issued an Executive Order “decreeing priority for defense orders placed with private industry.” (The authority had been voted to him the preceding June 28.) “The order set up the first general governmental control over private industry in the peace-time history of the United States,” commented the N.Y. Times. The Administration moved slowly and with caution down this dangerous and untried path. Roosevelt selected the most ineffective and pro-Wall Street of the Defense Commission chiefs to administer priority control: E.R. Stettinius, Jr., former chairman of U.S. Steel Corp. and a loyal “Morgan man.” It was not until February 24, four months after Roosevelt set up the priorities board and eight months after Congress voted him the power, that Stettinius put into effect the first industry-wide priority systems, in the machine tool and the aluminum industries, where shortages had been acute for months. The pace has been accelerating, however. Several weeks later, Stettinius had to put three more industries under full priority control: nickel, magnesium, and synthetic rubber. And it is expected that in the near future three more will be added: zinc, scrap iron and lumber – the last two of which have already been forced, by government pressure, to lower their prices.
 
For the Masses – Taxes, Enforced Savings, Rationing
We need not be too much upset by the sad plight of business. For the masses much worse things are in store than priorities. For one thing, of course, priorities as they extend v/ill more and more affect the living standards of the people. Her aluminum pots and pans are the first, but by no means the last, sacrifice the American housewife will have to make for the war. But there is much more than that to it.
Congress has raised the national debt limit to $65 billions, and there is already talk of $100 billions. The money will have to be raised by taxation and by borrowing. A survey of business sentiment printed in the December Fortune found a 67% majority in favor of higher taxes. This is less surprising than it seems: the question is, who is to be taxed? Recent Congressional actions give some clue to the answer. The excess profits tax passed last summer set rates at from 25% to 50% against 100% in England today. And on February 24 last, the Ways and Means Committee of the House made history by reporting out favorably a measure to lower corporation taxes by over $100,000,000 a year – the first time in ten years Congress has taken a step towards lowering the corporation tax. There is a campaign on in Congress – opposed at present by the Administration – to raise much of the needed war money through a general sales tax. As for borrowing, the Treasury already has announced a campaign to sell “baby bonds” and war-savings stamps in order to tap the income of the working class. If this voluntary method fails to bring in enough revenue, there is talk of some adaptation of the famous Keynes plan for “compulsory savings” (by withholding part of the workers’ wages until “after the war”) which was defeated last winter in England by labor opposition.
It is important to understand that such measures, at present, are designed chiefly to raise money. They have another effect, however, which will become increasingly important: by diverting the masses’ spending power into governmental channels, that is away from consumption goods into war goods, they promote that shift from butter to guns which is essential in a war economy. Thus a sales tax is simply an indirect form of rationing. It was for this reason and not for the additional revenue it raised (which was relatively negligible) that in England last fall the Churchill-Labour government finally put into effect a general sales tax. The same economic effects came from the sale, whether voluntary or forced, of Government securities to the public.
 
The Crisis-Point: Full Employment and Production
Here in America we are only in the first stages of war economy. All these devices – priorities, export controls, taxation, baby war bonds – are as nothing compared to the totalitarian control over the entire economy one sees in Germany. Our capitalist economy is still far from the real crisis-point, when the inflationary tendencies of war economy threaten to get out of control. That point will come when the national economy reaches a state of full employment and full production, that is to say, when consumer buying power at its maximum runs into the stone wall of a productive mechanism that can expand no more. The result then will be a runaway price inflation, unless the state can intervene to freeze prices and wages and divert – by taxes and direct rationing – mass purchasing power from consumption goods into the war machine.
The American economy is still far from that point today, with 7,000,000 unemployed and a large reservoir of unused plant capacity. Prices in the first eighteen months of the war have risen very little, and a few weeks ago the American Statistical Society predicted that commodity prices are not likely to rise more than from 5 per cent to 10 per cent during 1941. As Chairman Eccles of the Federal Reserve Board recently put it: “I do not see how it would be possible to have a dangerous general inflation so long as we have a large amount of idle men and unused resources.”
The crisis is still far off, but it is approaching. Some observers think that full employment and production may be reached by the middle of 1942. Already the Defense Commission has prepared a series of Executive Orders for price control, to be issued when necessary by the President. Much broader powers than he now has, however, will have to be voted by Congress. A government official recently remarked that much of the national price structure “is now being held at proper levels by means of paper clips and rubber bands.” Something more than paper clips will be needed later on.
 
The Road Ahead
How much “later on” it is depends not only on the economic factors just mentioned but also on political developments. It is easy to forget that the United States is not yet, technically, at war with Germany. But this technicality is important, for until an actual declaration of war the famous “M-Day” plans drawn up years ago by Army experts cannot go into effect. [4] The nature of these plans is indicated briefly in Time’s comment (June 10, 1940): “The U.S. M-Day Plan is so perfect that the actual Nazi program of complete mobilization for a knockout blow was based on it, after a six-month study, in 1934.”
The totalitarian nature of the measures Roosevelt will propose “later on” is clear. But to propose is one thing, to execute an-other. The great political problem which will then confront Roosevelt will be how to persuade – or force or both – the bourgeoisie on the one hand and the working class on the other to yield to the government the necessary authority for putting into effect a totalitarian social and economic system. [5] This is the problem Hitler had solved by 1936 (the “crisis-point” in the development of the German war economy), that Daladier-Reynaud never solved, and that is still far from being solved in England even today under the pressure of imminent invasion. The difficulties England is having, and American is beginning to have, in creating a total war economy came chiefly, in my opinion, from the fact that, unlike the German situation, there is no mass political pressure behind it. The political question here, which I have no space to go into, is whether such a totalitarian economy can be imposed administratively, from the top, or whether a mass political movement like fascism is necessary. In other words, can there be a “white” or “cold” fascism? The answer to that question depends largely on the ability of the American working class to make its strength felt in economic and political action. And here we can take heart from the Reuther and C.I.O. plans which, however reactionary politically, demonstrate that the American working class, by virtue of its class position and interests, can think and plan in terms far broader and more effective than the American bourgeoisie is able to. Much the same lesson is to be learned from the intervention of British labor in this war. And let us hope that the sad fate of the C.I.O. proposals, and of the Labour party leaders in the Churchill cabinet, will sink home to the American workers, and that they will come to understand that the struggle against fascism, inside and outside the country, can only be fought on a revolutionary political basis. The only alternative to Roosevelt’s “white fascism” is revolutionary socialism.

Notes
1. Conservative papers have claimed that “defense” strikes, while not on a large scale, have involved key production points – so that a strike of a few hundred men in, say, an aluminum casting plant might hold up the work of many thousands of industries dependent on that plant’s output for some essential part. This is possible, but there is no way of proving it without much more research than I have seen devoted to the subject. And in any case it seems doubtful that this factor could raise the one-fourth of l per cent loss estimated by Secretary Perkins to anything significant.
2. About the same time as the Reuther and C.I.O. plans were made public, the National Association of Manufacturers held its annual Congress of American Industry. The historical bankruptcy of the present-day American ruling class was here dramatically revealed. The Congress of Industry devoted its sessions to such vital current problems as government ownership of the railroads (against), the St. Lawrence Waterway Project (against), the Wagner Act (against), the unbalanced federal budget (against), etc. Its biggest achievement was to launch the Robey investigation of “subversive” sentiments in the nation’s schoolbooks. As little as possible was said about the fact there is a war on, for, as Time put it: “The subject of defense found the cream of American industry unable to make up Its mind.”
3. It is true that there are still 7,000,000 unemployed, and that a large percentage of the national productive capacity is still idle much of the time. But to put these to work would involve government interference with the economic system on a tremendous scale. This idle capacity is wholly among the smaller plants. The big monopolistic corporations, whose pressure on the Administration is decisive, have more orders than they can handle now and are not at all interested in sharing the gravy with smaller competitors (who find it hard to get government orders precisely because they are small). Centralized planning and control could undoubtedly greatly increase production even by the big corporations, but the fate of the Reuther Plan is an indication of how far that solution is likely to get.
4. There may well be, however, a campaign to get Congress to grant M-Day powers to Roosevelt even in peacetime. Thus the U.S. News for March 14 reports: “High Army and Navy officials are convinced that this country’s defense effort will not click until Mr. Roosevelt takes the Army-Navy Industrial mobilization plan out of the mothballs and gives it a try.”
5. It goes without saying that the chief problem will be not the bourgeoisie but the working class, which loses more and suffers more under a total war regime. But let us not underestimate the difficulties to be encountered from the bourgeoisie as well. Their fears are well expressed in a recent businessman’s newsletter from Washington: “Trend is very strong towards bigger and bigger government. Defense emphasis tends to obscure this trend; to divert attention from steadily growing use of government power; to hide real meaning of what’s happening ... It’s a super-New Deal that is growing up, that is taking shape as government moves in to direct a vast and growing defense effort. Industry recalls that it was somewhat the same in 1917–18 ... But overlooked is the fact that Roosevelt is building defense into the regular machinery of government; that in 1917–18 wartime controls were built outside regular government machinery; that there will be much more difficulty deflating government after the present emergency than after the last one. Ideas that present defense controls are just a flash in the pan mistaken.”

1. The Mountain Brings Forth a Mouse
On April 29, 1938, President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress calling for “a thorough study of the concentration of economic power in American industry.” A few days later the Temporary National Economic Committee (better known as “the Monopoly Committee”) was born, It has been holding hearings and issuing reports ever since. Last week, after three years’ of activity, the Monopoly Committee closed up shop. It had spent $1,062,000, had once had a staff of 182 experts, had looked into 95 different industries and heard 552 witnesses. It leaves behind it as a permanent record 37 volumes of testimony, plus 43 exhaustive economic studies in special fields.
Out of all this you would expect something pretty formidable to come. Both Roosevelt in his 1938 speech and Chairman O’Mahoney of the Committee in his closing statement talk much of the connection between big business and fascism, and express doubts as to whether the “democratic way of life” can be preserved unless the growth of monopoly is checked. What does the committee propose to do about it? The recommendations in its final report boil down to:

better enforcement of the Sherman Anti-Trust Laws;
 
changes in present patent laws, to make it harder for patents to be used as a base for monopoly;
 
Federal chartering of interstate corporations (instead of leaving this in the hands of the states, as today);
 
encouraging small business by government-guaranteed loans.

All of these measures were proposed long before the Monopoly Committee began its studies; all of them are the mildest, most timid sort of reform gestures. The general press comment on the Monopoly Committee’s final report was well summed up in Time:
“With all the ammunition stored up, a terrific broadside might have been expected. Instead, the committee rolled a rusty BB gun into place, pinged at the nation’s economic problems …”
 
“On th’ Other Hand, Not So Fast”
In a word, although – as we shall presently see – the Monopoly Committee discovered an even greater concentration of economic power than it expected to find, its final report proposes to do precisely nothing about it. There’s nothing mysterious about the reason for this. Chairman O’Mahoney states it clearly at the beginning of his final statement for the committee:
“No member of this committee and no person in any way affiliated with it has ever made any suggestion to the chairman or to the committee the purpose of which was to do other than strengthen our traditional economic and political order ... I believe therefore that our final report should begin with a definite and unequivocal declaration of our faith in free enterprise.”
The same note was struck three years earlier in the Presidential message which called the committee into being. Referring to “unhappy events abroad,” the President warned Congress that democracy was not safe if “the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself. ... Among us today a concentration of private power without equal in history is growing.” The President also made it clear, however, that his proposal “is not intended as the beginning of any ill-considered ‘trust-busting’ activity.” Quite the contrary, he insisted that his main concern was “to preserve private enterprise for profit.”
The difficulty is a simple one. The United States today is dominated, politically and economically, by a few hundred huge corporations, banks and insurance companies. These are controlled by a few hundred thousand executives and big investors. This is that “growth of private power” which Roosevelt and O’Mahoney want to destroy – and this is also that system of “private enterprise for profit” which these gentlemen want to protect. Both jobs can’t be done at once – at least not by the same political leaders. But it is not in Roosevelt’s interest to recognize this simple truth.
And so his 1938 message to Congress was a Presidential monopoly message in the classic American tradition; which goes right back to the Sherman Anti-Trust Law of 1890. To it can be applied the comment of Mr. Dooley on a similar message to Congress by Roosevelt the First some 40 years ago:
“The trusts, says, he, are beejous monsthers built up by th’ enlightened intherprise iv th’ men that have done so much to advance progress in our beloved country, he says. On wan hand I wud stamp thim under fut; on th’ other hand, not so fast.”
The Monopoly Committee has produced much data of the greatest value and interest for all students of the American economic system. There is a great deal of material in its published record which the labor movement can use effectively in its fight. But that its recommendations for ACTION, even if put through Congress tomorrow, would solve none of the problems the committee was created to study – this is agreed on by bourgeois as well as Marxist commentators. And the reason is that this is a class society and that the committee approached these problems – of unemployment, poverty, economic disorganization – from the point of view of the ruling class, that is, of those very trusts and monopolies which have created these problems in the first place. In the immortal words of Chairman O’Mahoney, early in the committee’s history:
”We of the committee might just as well be sitting on the other side of the table [that is, with the monopolists being ‘investigated’]. Our interests are really the same.”

2. The American Ruling Class Sits for Its Portrait
In its three-year study of the American economy, the Monopoly Committee built up the most complete picture we have of the tremendous concentration of economic power in a few hands that has been going on in this country in the last 40 years. Its findings may be summed up very sketchily here under three heads:

the sheer size of big business in America today;
 
the dominating position of the big corporation in the American economy;
 
the tremendous concentration of wealth at one end of the social scale and the equally striking poverty of the great mass of the American people.
 

(1) The Bigness of Big Business
To bring home the huge size of the great American corporations, the Monopoly Committee adopted a dramatic device. It listed, in order of asset value, the 48 states and the 30 biggest corporations. This table is reproduced on this page. Note that only ten states have total assessed property within their borders of greater value than the assets of the two biggest corporations: the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. Also that, at the other end of the scale, there are 18 states which are “worth” less than the smallest of the 30 biggest corporations. These figures cause even Chairman O’Mahoney of the committee to raise the question: “In popular discussion, these corporations are regarded as ‘private enterprise.’ But how private is such enterprise after all?”
 
(2) An Economy of Private Monopoly
The committee analyzed the production of 1,807 manufactured products – a fair cross-section of the entire productive system. It found that for one-half of these products – ranging from cigarettes to steel ingots – the four biggest manufacturers in the field accounted for 75 per cent or more of the total U.S. output. A quarter of these products were found to be “extremely concentrated” – that is, the “big four” in the field produced much more than 75 per cent of the total output.
There has been a steady increase in the power of the big corporations for the past three decades, the committee found. In 1937, although “central office” establishments were only 3.8 per cent of the total number, they employed 51 per cent of all wage earners (as against only 47 per cent in 1929) and produced 61 per cent of the value of all manufactured products (only 54 per cent in 1929).
So, too, with corporate assets. There, is a “proletariat” and an “aristocracy” among corporations. In 1937, the 228,721 American corporations with assets of less than $50,000 each were 55 per cent of the total number of corporations, but between them owned less than 1½ per cent of the national corporate assets. At the other end of the scale, the 394 biggest corporations – less than 1/10 of 1 per cent of the total number of corporations – owned almost 45 per cent of all corporate assets.
And so, too, finally, with income. In 1929, the 3/10 of 1 per cent pf the nation’s corporations which had assets of over $1,000,000 swallowed no less than 80 per cent of the total corporation income. And in 1937, the “little fellows’’ (those with an annual income of less than $5,000), constituting. 65 per cent of all corporations, received considerably less than 2 per cent of the total corporate income, while the “big fellows” (those with annual Incomes of $5,000,000 or more) received 40 per cent of the total income. When Roosevelt speaks of “private enterprise,” he means, economically, big business. The little business man has long ceased to have much economic significance – or power.
 
3. Plutocracy and Poverty
The real political dynamite in the committee’s findings lies in the terrible contrast its statistics reveal between the wealth of a few hundred thousand citizens of this great “democracy” and the poverty of the vast majority of the inhabitants of the richest country in the world.
First of all, the committee shows clearly that the gigantic corporations which control the American economy (and government) are in their turn held tight in the fists of a few big stockholders.
The next time you read about the wide distribution of stock holdings in the big corporations – the 640,000 widows and orphans who “own” AT&T, for instance – remember these two facts:

in recent years, less than 1 per cent of the nations families have received over half the total dividends, and 1/10 of 1 per cent have received 35 per cent of all dividends;
 
even within the group of families receiving dividends, the same concentration occurs, so that 11 per cent of the dividend-receiving families got two-thirds of the total dividend distribution.

And the next time you read of how the policies of these huge corporations are democratically decided by majority vote of their millions of stockholders, remember these two facts:

the 20 biggest stockholders in the 200 biggest corporations between them held, on the average, one-third of the total voting stock (enough, ordinarily, to insure actual control of the corporations);
 
in 40 per cent of these 200 biggest Corporations, control was held either “in one family or in a small group of families.”

Finally:
“Fifteen of the 200 great corporations were controlled by three families (the duPonts, Rockefellers and Mellons) and their holdings in these corporations were valued at $1,400,000,000.”
So much for who RUNS the economy. The evidence is even more striking as to who BENEFITS from the American economy. Who gets the gravy, to put it crudely.
“In 1936,” reports the committee, “the lower two thirds of the nation’s income groups had only negative savings.” The term “negative savings” is a polite way of saying that two out of three American families that year had to spend more than their income in order to keep alive.
“The bottom third went into the red to the extent of $1,207,000,000 and the middle third to $252,000,000. The top third, on the other hand, saved $7,437,000,000. To put this in another way: if the whole population were divided into equal numerical groups of 2,750,000 families each, the top 10 per cent, with incomes over $4,600, saved 86 per cent of the total savings made in 1929, while the second 10 per cent, with incomes ranging from $3,100 to $4,600, saved 12 per cent, and the other 2 per cent of savings were accounted for by the remaining 80 per cent of the population.”
Another fact, which the committee does not dwell on but which is indirectly stated in the quotation just given, is that the vast majority of the FAMILIES of this country – eight out of every ten – live on a FAMILY income of less than $3,100 a year.
 
“A Very Difficult Matter”
The main line of the committee’s reasoning on this crucial question of the wealth of the few and the poverty of the many, can be summed up as follows:

“Fully one-half of all corporate stock dividends are received by less than 75,000 persons of the 130,000,000 who inhabit the United States.”
 
“These evidences of ownership, however; are only part of the story. The control of the resources of the country rests in even fewer hands.”
 
“The contrast between the $7,000,000,000 of savings in the upper third of the population and the $2,000,000,000 of dis-savings in the lower third suggests that some levelling off of the income pyramid would result in the immediate betterment of the position of the lower third, without depriving the country of any needed funds for investment ... How to implement such reasoning is a very difficult matter, however ...”

A very difficult matter, indeed! Especially if you start off with the aim so frankly announced by Chairman O’Mahoney in his final statement: “to strengthen our traditional economic and political order.”
 



January 10, 1941, may go down in American history as the official death-date of what is left of American democracy..For on that day a bill drawn up in the White House was introduced into the Congress of the United States. Its official title is: “A BILL TO FURTHER PROMOTE THE DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES”. (A lot of territory is covered by “for other purposes”.) Some waggish clerk gave the bill the symbolic number, H.R. 1776, but the less people think about the spirit of ’seventy-six, the better pleased the framers of H.R. 1776 will be.
H.R. 1776 is not very long. It goes right to the point. It begins with a definition of the term “defense article” as “(1) any weapon, munition, aircraft, vessel, or boat; (2) any machinery, facility, tool, material or supply necessary for the manufacture, production, processing, repair, servicing or operation of any article described in this subsection; (3) any component material or part of or equipment for any article described in this subsection; (4) any other article or commodity, for defense.” Steel mills, coal mines, rubber plants – these are all “defense articles”, since they are “facilities” for manufacturing boots and trucks and guns. And section (4) takes care of anything forgotten in the first three parts. Just about every product of American industry – and every plant for producing it – can be embraced under this heading if the President merely lays his hands on it and murmurs the magic word, “defense”.
The powers that the President is given by H.R. 1776 over “defense articles” are outlined in Section III. It is probable that this remarkable section will be toned down in the course of Congressional debate. But it is worth reprinting here in full just as it stands as an indication of how far the Roosevelt Administration is prepared by now to go on the road to to war and dictatorship. Its full text is as follows:
(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the President may, from time to time, when he deems it in the interest of national defense, authorize the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, or the head of any other department or agency of the government:

1. To manufacture in arsenals, factories and shipyards under their jurisdiction, or otherwise procure, any defense article for the government of any country whose defense the President deems vital to the defense of the United States.
2. To sell, transfer, exchange, lease, lend, or otherwise dispose of, to any such government any defense article.
3. To test, inspect, prove, repair, outfit, recondition, or otherwise to place in good working order any defense article for any such government under Paragraph 2 of this subsection.
4. To communicate to any such government information pertaining to any defense article furnished to such government under the proposed bill.
5. To release for export any defense article to any such government

(B) The terms and, conditions upon which,any such foreign government receives any aid authorized under subsection (A) shall be those which the President deems satisfactory, and the benefit to the United States may be payment or repayment in kind or property, or any other direct or indirect benefit which the President deems satisfactory.
In non-legal language this means that the President would have the power, if he thinks it in the interest of “national defense” to (1) hand over to England or China, or Peru, or any other nation “whose defense the President deems vital to the defense of the U.S.” every gun, plane, and tank now owned by the U.S. Army and every ship of the U.S. Navy; (2) repair and recondition the entire British (or Chinese or Peruvian) fleet in American shipyards and dry docks; (3) accept as “compensation” anything at all he “deems satisfactory”, from $1 up, or, if he thinks best, nothing at all; (4) organize the whole U.S. productive capacity to turn out munitions for England (or China or Peru).
All of this the President can do entirely on his own initiative, without consulting either Congress or Cabinet or another living soul. No wonder the N.Y. Times headlined its London dispatch that day: “ROOSEVELT’S PLANS ENCOURAGE BRITAIN ... Amazement and Gratification Are Expressed Over Terms of Our Defense Bill ... ‘THE ABSOLUTE ULTIMATE’ ...” The “absolute ultimate” indeed!
There has been considerable opposition to the new bill expressed already in Congress, mostly from Republicans, but one Republican has come out boldly for it: Roosevelt’s late “opponent” in the 1940 campaign, Wendell Willkie. Dropping the pretense of being less pro-war than Roosevelt which he had adopted in the closing weeks of the campaign. Willkie not only endorsed the bill but also announced he was leaving by Clipper in a few days for London, so that he could get a first-hand impression of the “international atmosphere”. The State Department, Willkie added, sees absolutely no objection to his proposed trip.
Thus the last footnote has been added to the fraudulent “Willkievelt” campaign, in which the voters of this great democracy were permitted to choose between getting into the war under the leadership of Franklin D. Roosevelt and getting into the war under the leadership of Wendell Willkie.
Candor compels me to admit that the best summary of the situation was formulated by none other than Alf Landon of Kansas, who said:
“There is no essential difference between Mr. Willkie’s position and Mr. Roosevelt’s position, which is to go to war if necessary to help England win. If Mr. Willkie had revealed it before the Republican National Convention, he would not have been nominated, and if Mr. Roosevelt had revealed it before the election, be would not have been re-elected.”
(The last sentence, of course, is a fraud. The only ones who may be said, to have been unaware of Willkievelt’s war policy, were those workers who were deluded into voting for the Boss candidates. Certainly not Landon!)
There is little doubt but that some of the more sweeping powers in the bill in H.R. 1776 will be curtailed in the course of debate in Congress. And one should also remember that in a not-yet-though-going-there totalitarian society like the United States there is always a big difference between the forms of State control, however sweeping, and the actual extent to which they are able, with the best will in the world, to be put into practice. (As I showed two weeks ago, England is far from having a total war economy even today, eight months after the Churchill-Labor government got from parliament the sweeping formal powers of the Emergency Acts.) But there seems little doubt that the bill, in modified form, will be passed by Congress. And even if Roosevelt is able to exercise in fact only a quarter of its formal powers, a great step will be taken on that road to war and dictatorship along which American capitalism is now marching.
 



The papers are now full of the failure of the American ‘national defense’ program to progress as planned. It is now seven months after the German blitzkrieg against France; the situation of England has grown desperate and it is becoming clear that only large-scale shipments of guns, planes, ships from America will make up for her productive losses from German bombing. Congress has appropriated billions on billions, orders have been placed, great gestures have been made of putting America on ‘a war footing’. Yet it now appears that little has been so far accomplished. The current statements of Stimson and Knudsen (who revealed a serious lag in plane production), the open conflict between New Dealers and private industry over increase of steel capacity and diversion of planes to the private airlines – when this much dirty linen gets washed in public, we may be sure much more is still in the hamper.
Much the same situation – and for the same reasons – seems to obtain in England today. The British Government is now spending on the war about $40,000,000 a day. It is expected that in the coming year, England’s $14,000,000,000 – which is half again as much as the highest national budget yet borne by the 131,000,000 American people. A war effort on this scale cannot be conducted within the social, political or economic framework of normal peacetime capitalism. War today is a social – though by no means necessarily a socialistic undertaking. It involves such enormous expenditures, such wide participation by the whole civil population, such a drastic shift in the national productive effort as to require that production be centrally controlled, planned and coordinated and that the interests of specific individuals, groups and classes be subordinated to the general aim of winning the war.
The particular war which the Churchill-Labor Government is trying to win has a twofold aspect. To the great majority of the British working class it is a war for ‘democracy’, a war to protect their class interests against the black reaction represented by Hitler. To the British bourgeoisie, however, it is a war against a rival group of imperialist bandits, who constitute a deadly threat to British imperial profits and plunder. Since the British bourgeoisie are still most definitely the ruling class, and since both the Labor and the Tory chiefs of the Government are agreed on the preservation of capitalism in England, it is the second view of the war which is the reality, the first which is the illusion The Churchill-Labor regime is waging an imperialist war, in defense not of ‘democracy’ but of the British Empire. The nature of this war has determined the nature of the present British war economy.
I can see two methods of getting the degree of centralized State control and coordination of the entire national economy which is necessary to meet on equal terms the kind of totalitarian war economy that has been built up in Germany. A working class socialist regime, which puts the most numerous and progressive class in full control of the economy, could build up a war potential in a country like England or the United States which could easily outstrip Hitler’s war machine. Or, of course, it can be done by instituting the same kind of a regime as Hitler has – a totalitarian dictatorship exercising rigid control over both the working class and the bourgeoisie, and able to suppress the contradictions of the capitalist market. But I doubt that it can be done as the bourgeoisie of America and England – with the enthusiastic cooperation of the important working class organizations – are now attempting to do it: by a patchwork ‘war economy’ built within the confines of democratic capitalism. Let us look briefly at the English experience as a case in point.
 
The Chamberlain Government
Every one now agrees that, for the first eight months of the war, under the Chamberlain Government, England had little more than the forms of a modern ‘war economy’. As Fortune (July 1940) described it:
“Englishmen could not recall such a state of laws and decrees. All shipping and ship construction, transportation and food distribution were nationalized ... A Ministry of Supply with power to decide priorities for thousands of commodities, was assembled and charged with the double task of organizing British industry for war and holding up exports ‘to win foreign exchange’ to pay for war goods. Yet, as in France, this State control for the first eight months of the war, was theoretical more than it was real, for it, too, sought to reconcile its aspirations with those of private enterprise.”
The forms of war economy can look fine on paper, but can prove to be merely forms. (Even the supreme step of nationalization may turn out to be a form merely; thus the French war industries, especially aircraft, were nationalized in the Popular Front period, while those of Germany remained in private hands.)
Despite all the laws and decrees, economists noted that under Chamberlain the number of unemployed remained well over one million, aircraft production rose very slowly, shipbuilding lagged, and all sorts of profitable but militarily useless luxury and consumers’ goods continued to be produced. The reason was that the control of this ‘war economy’ was in the hands of the same conservative politicians and big businessmen who had built up and controlled Britain’s peacetime capitalist system – and who stood to lose by any very drastic or sudden transformation of this system into a war economy. It is true that this loss would be merely immediate and temporary, and that victory in the war will mean huge postwar profits for the British ruling class. In this sense, an effective war economy would be a shrewd ‘long-term investment’ for the British bourgeoisie. But history goes to show that, so long as big business itself remains in direct political control of the war economy, immediate property interests are not effectively curbed and the result is pretty much of a compromise patchwork. This is the situation in England in this war.
 
Churchill-Labor Reorganization
When the new Churchill-Labor government, on May 22, twelve days after it took office, put through Parliament the Emergency Powers Defense Bill, giving Government the widest powers over capital and labor, much to-do was made in the press about the new ‘totalitarian’ regime. And indeed, compared to the laissez-faire policy of Chamberlain, there was considerable tightening of the British economy. A month later. Minister of Supply Morrison was able to announce some impressive gains in production of aircraft, guns and tanks. Unemployment has been reduced, civilian consumption curtailed, non-military imports severely rationed, a firmer control exercised by the State over production in general.
But looking back on the eight months the Churchill-Labor Government has been in office, and considering how desperate has been, and is today more than ever, the situation of Britain, one is struck not with how much but with how little has been done.
Chamberlain’s Sir John Simon has been succeeded in the key economic post of Chancellor of the Exchequer by the equally conservative and equally incompetent Sir Kingsley Wood, whose budgets, like those of Simon, have been sharply criticised as inadequate and timid.
Not until October was a real effort made to stop the wasting of productive facilities on luxury goods, and even then only a stopgap measure was taken: the imposition of a 24% sales tax. The sale of new automobiles was stopped only in October, and the sale of silk stockings and silk underwear (which had diverted much needed silk from the armed forces) was prohibited only this month. Most incredible of all, according to Commerce Reports of October 5: “A civil building control similar to that in the last war becomes effective on October 7, under which private building and construction will be prohibited except under license from the Commissioner of Works.” Measures like these were, of course, taken in Germany years ago. Unemployment has been reduced, but not very much. The latest figures to hand show 829,000 unemployed in the middle of September. Many of these, of course, lost their jobs because of the curtailment of consumers’ goods which the Government has been carrying on. But it is a severe indictment of the regime that, despite its desperate need for industrial production, it is unable to use these workers.
Finally, with a few exceptions such as Laborite Hugh Dalton in the Ministry of Economic Warfare, the representatives of the business community are still in control of the key posts in the British war economy. Beaverbrook, the millionaire publisher, heads the Ministry of Aircraft Production. The aforementioned steelmaster, Sir A. Duncan, in October replaced Laborite Morrison in the vital Ministry of Supply. And so on down the line. These gentlemen are still hesitant about invoking too drastically against their class colleagues the enormous powers they possess on paper. Thus in Commerce Reports for August 10, we read: “The compulsory powers available to Government have been invoked sparingly, reliance being placed on voluntary cooperation as far as possible.” What this means is that, as in the case of our own War Industries Board in the last war, one group of businessmen, temporarily representing the collective interests of the national bourgeoisie, sit down to bargain with another group of businessmen, representing each his own private interests (by no means necessarily synonymous) – and the result is at best compromise, at worst stalemate. England is in no situation today to afford either luxury.
 
Laborite Shinwell on the Situation
In Time for December 9 last, there was an interesting report on a speech recently made in Parliament by a Labor member, Emanuel Shinwell:
In a powerful, reasoned and disturbing speech, Shin well shocked the House by declaring: ‘Unless we can with speed and with utmost efficiency reorganize our resources ... victory may be beyond our grasp.’ Laborite Shinwell went on to denounce the Government’s propagandist optimism (lsquo;The people of this country have no desire to be fobbed off with an exaggerated optimism which has no foundation in fact.’) and the Government’s inconsistent announcements on industrial production ... Shinwell then gave some pertinent figures to back up his claim that shipping losses were ‘ominous’ ... Since the beginning of July, shipping losses have been at the rate of 4,000,000 tons a year. Against this the Admiralty’s shipbuilding program aimed at only 1,250,000 tons in the first war year, and even this figure was not reached. Lord Beaverbrook had upped aircraft production at shipbuilding’s expense, said Shinwell; the Government had not used its emergency powers to transfer labor to the most useful work; emergencies were being met by appeals, not by compulsion; “we can’t run the war by a succession of Flag Days”.
“Flag Days won’t win the war against Germany.” But for the kind of unstable, uneasy Tory-Labor coalition now ruling England, any too direct pressure against either capital . or labor is risky, and Flag Days (“appeals, not compulsion”) seem a much less dangerous method of conducting the war. It would not improve matters decisively if the Labor Party took over full control of the war effort. For the Labor Party is also committed to the defense of capitalism, and its leadership also fears to violate property interests and its leadership also must respect the ‘rights’ and interests of the British plutocracy. Nor is the Labor top bureaucracy any too sure of its holds on the working class, which is constantly pressing in a leftward direction.
The people of England can organize a war economy as effective as that of Germany only by changing the character of the war – overthrowing the present British ruling class by revolution and replacing it with a democratic working-class socialist order. This would put an unconquerable morale into the British masses, it would make possible a really planned and coordinated war economy, and above all, it would mean a set of war aims which would call forth working-class support behind Hitler’s lines on the Continent. Or the British plutocracy can do the job in its own way by trying to put into power a native brand of fascism. These are the ultimate choices. There is another aspect of British war economy, not touched on here, which I plan to consider next week: namely, the relative burdens borne by the workers and the bourgeoisie, and what if any shift has followed the coming into power of the Churchill-Labor Government.
 



President Roosevelt took two major steps in his war policy this week. He made an “all-out” speech to Congress asking for full military aid to Britain and declaring an undeclared war against Germany. And he appointed Sidney Hillman and W.S. Knudsen as the top bosses, with equal powers, of the entire rearmament program. Both moves were efforts to answer the same tough question: how to get the support of the American masses for a war which is not their war but a war to defend and extend the interests of American imperialism throughout the world?
 
First Meet Mr. Knudsen-Hillman
The appointment of Hillman to co-leadership with Knudsen of the whole “defense” program came as a shock to the conservative press. When the top “defense” body was being shaped a few weeks ago, it was originally proposed – and even announced – that Knudsen would be the boss, a one-man economic dictator like Baruch in the last war, while Hillman, representing – theoretically, at least – labor, was not even to be on the top board. The left New Dealers persuaded Roosevelt to include Hillman as a fourth board member, the other three being Knox, Stimson and Knudsen.’And now we find Hillman made co-leader with Knudsen, while Knox and Stimson take back seats.
It seems clear that the White House is impressed by the militancy with which organized labor has been fighting for its interests of late, and the failure of the flag-waving, red-baiting campaign to prevent strikes in “defense” industries. The Reuther plane-manufacturing plan, the current Ford organizing drive – these are also factors. Hillman’s appointment is thus partly a concession to labor. It is also an attempt to take labor into camp. For Hillman, as the President well knows, is a “safe” and “reasonable” labor leader, who can be relied on to do his best to keep labor in line for war production. When reporters asked what would happen if Hillman and Knudsen disagreed – on giving contracts to Ford, for instance – “the President insisted that the question was silly”. He just couldn’t imagine such a thing.
To persistent questions, Roosevelt replied that he had “only one defense chief” and that “his name is Knudsen-Hillman”. Roosevelt is no amateur in matters of this sort. He and his close advisers have had many months of experience with Hillman and have found him always entirely “reasonable”. It will be Hillman’s job to hold labor in line for the war and to prevent as much as possible strikes and other signs of labor revolt. But because of the very nature of his position and of his background, Hillman will have to yield more to working class pressure than, say, his partner, Knudsen, would have to. It is up to labor to provide that pressure in ever-increasing measure from now on.
 
Now Listen to FDR’s Speech
President Roosevelt’s speech before Congress went even farther on the road to war than his radio “fireside chat” of last week. He made it clear that, so far as his Administration is concerned, the United States is already at war with Germany. He repeated, in stronger terms, his proposal to send U.S. Army and Navy planes, guns and munitions “abroad ts our friends who by their determined and heroic resistance are giving us time in which to make ready our own defense”. And he added: “We will not be intimidated by the threats of dictators that they will regard it as a breach of international law or os an act of war.” Look at Norway, Holland, Belgium, he said; they trusted in international war and waited for the Nazis to attack first. The implication was clear ...
There was a noticeable lack of enthusiasm in the response of the members of Congress to the President’s fevered oratory. Maybe they were thinking of the seventeen billions they would be asked to vote for as an initial payment on the coming year’s war expenses. I think it more likely, however, they were beginning to wonder just how the Anglo-American bloc was going to be able to drive Hitlerism from the face of the earth – and how they could present the war aims of Churchill-Roosevelt to their constituents.
 
The “Four Freedoms”
The feeblest part of the President’s speech was its grand climax – the statement of American war aims. For the first time, Roosevelt ventured to put into itemized forms the aims he conceives Britain and America to have in this war. Here is the best he could do:
“In the future days which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.
“The first is freedom of speech and expression – everywhere in the world.
“The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way – everywhere in the world.
“The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants – everywhere in the world.
“The fourth is freedom, from fear, which translated into world terms, means a worldwide reduction of armaments ...”
It seems incredible that in the year 1941 the thrice-elected leader of the richest and most industrially advanced nation in the world should talk in these moth-eaten terms of Wilsonianism. They meant little in Wilson’s day, they mean less today. It is as though a witch doctor should try to cure a typhoid epidemic by magic passes and incantations. But there is a reason.
Roosevelt’s first two “freedoms.” of speech and religion, have existed in emasculated form in the capitalist world for a century and a half, without preventing periodic world wars. In actual practice the first of these along with other liberties, is fast becoming a chimera in the United States. For, Roosevelt’s verbal allegiance to democracy notwithstanding, totalitarianism – the abolition of such liberties as freedom of speech – is inherent in the very nature of the war he proposes to wage. (And what an index of the backward and reactionary nature of this so-called ‘advanced’ Administration, to include in 1941 as one of four supreme war aims – the winning of religious freedom! That was once taken, for granted!)
Roosevelt’s last two “freedoms” are faint echoes of liberal-capitalist illusions which have been thoroughly exploded by the course of events since the last war – and by Roosevelt’s own policies! Who still preserves the innocent faith to be able to believe in free trade and disarmament as panaceas for the ills of the twentieth century world?
Roosevelt, however, needs to be given this much credit: he probably doesn’t take his “war aims” very seriously either. But he is in the same spot as the present political leaders of England: he must call the masses into action to defend “democracy” against the totalitarian menace, and yet he must avoid any possible incitement to revolution, any possible implication that fundamental social and economic changes might be desirable. So he talks in what are for him catch phrases, which mean little in the face of reality, and hopes for the best. Though he may speak in mumbo-jumbo, Roosevelt knows witch-doctoring is a fake.
There is nothing in these four points of Roosevelt’s worth the blood of a single American worker. Yes, real democracy is something to fight for. But the Negro who lives under lynch terror, the worker who is threatened not to strike, know how little is the value of democracy in the mouth of a Roosevelt.
A war conducted to defend a socialist America against Hitler, a war in alliance with a socialist Britain, a war to build a new world of economic and social justice based on the rule of the working masses – this kind of a war could be expressed in slogans which would arouse support throughout Europe and make Hitler’s (and capitalism’s) position impossible. This kind of a war would enlist the full support of American workers. Roosevelt can’t fight it because he is defending the present capitalist system – which finds democracy an ever increasing embarrassment. So he has to maneuver around with Hillman and talk the old platitudes about free speech and free trade. It remains to be seen whether this is enough to persuade the working class of America that this is their war.
 



AS EVERY ONE KNOWS, popular education is one of the great historical cornerstones of bourgeois democracy. Free schools were one of the first and most insistent demands of the rising proletariat in the last century. The bourgeoisie made this concession partly because it could afford to and partly because it fitted in with its own interests. For all its limitations, parliamentary democracy meant a greater participation of the masses in the political life of the nation than either feudalism or the absolute monarchy had granted. And this in turn demanded a minimum of popular education. There was also another aspect, concisely expressed in the Encyclopaedia Britannica article on Education:
“The nation that is not to fail in the struggle for commercial success ... must needs see that its industries are fed with a constant supply of workers adequately equipped in respect both of general intelligence and technical training.”
Illiterate peasants are as little useful to the modern employer as to the bourgeois-democratic politician.
Thus one finds the rise of popular education synchronizing with the rise of industrial capitalism. In France, the foundations of the modern system of state-supported free schools was laid in legislation introduced in 1833 by Guizot, mouthpiece of the rising bourgeoisie and author of the celebrated slogan—“Enrichisses-vous!” Bismarck and the social democracy joined hands to create a model system of state education at the same time as German industry was rationalizing its plants and winning ever greater victories in world markets. In England, the Chartist agitation stimulated the raising of the annual parliamentary grant to education from £30,000 in 1839 to £100,000 in 1846, £396,000 in 1855, and £663,000 in 1858. In the United States, the first compulsory school attendance law was passed in 1854, in the middle of the decade during which the country, according to the historian, V.S. Clark, “made the most remarkable industrial progress in its history”—a decade which saw the nation’s two chief industries, textiles and iron, almost double their production.
Between 1865 and 1930, popular education in the United States steadily gained momentum. Decade after decade, the statistics on schools, like those on steel production, mounted ever more triumphantly. In 1870, 57% of all children of school age were enrolled in the public grade schools. By 1880 it was 65%, by 1900 72%, by 1932 83%. The boom in high school and college education came later, in the twentieth century. In 1890 only 6% of those between the ages of 14 and 17 were enrolled in public or private high schools. By 1900 the figure was 10%, by 1920 26%, by 1930 48%. College enrollment rose from 238,000 in 1900 to 598,000 in 1920 and 1,100,000 in 1930. These are figures to make any Fourth of July orator expand with justified pride. O, beautiful for spacious skies ...
 
Distress Signals
The depression hit the public school system like a hurricane. In 1930 annual expenditure per public grade school pupil was $90. By 1932 this had fallen to $82, and by 1934 to $65, according to the Statistical Abstract of the US (1938). The short-lived “Roosevelt recovery” won back some of the ground lost, expenditures rising to $74 per pupil in 1936. But the recovery has gone with the wind and for the last two years the national economy has hung in the doldrums, slowly and steadily drifting backward. By now, in the spring of 1939, there are increasing signs that a serious crisis is impending in popular education. According to Time for April 24, “By last week so many distress signals flew over US schoolhouses that educators were thoroughly alarmed.” Time itemized a few:

In Ohio the state school fund is $17,000,000 in the red, and several cities are facing a complete shutdown of their schools.
 
School funds are “low” in Colorado, Michigan, Illinois, the Dakotas.
 
The Pennsylvania Property Owners Association recently stated that “Pennsylvania’s public school system is doomed to early collapse”. Conditions are especially bad in the coal counties, where operators owe millions in local taxes—the great Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co. alone owing $3,000,000. In eight coal counties, 6,000 teachers have received no pay for from one to ten months. To support their families, those not lucky enough to get relief have been working after school hours as undertakers, night watchmen, store clerks, salesmen, and coal bootleggers.

“Pennsylvania’s educators,” writes Time, “pleaded with economy-minded Governor James to replenish the special State fund for schools in distressed areas, now exhausted. Having pleaded in vain, nearly 200 teachers last week marched out of 27 schools in Northumberland and Schuylkill Counties, declared they would not go back until they were paid.”
“Georgia owes its schoolteachers $5,000,000, sees no way of paying them before June 30—and after that date they cannot collect because of a State law prohibiting debt carry-overs to the next fiscal year. Unofficial calculations were that 200 Georgia schools, with 20,000 pupils, were closed ... In Lamar County, white children’s school term was shortened to eight months, Negro children’s schools were closed.”
The Little Red School House —
As these facts indicate, the current school crisis is most acute in the rural and small-town areas, where it is merely an intensification of a long-chronic condition.
“In 1930,” Time’s article begins, “although every US state had laws requiring that all children be schooled, some 800,000 US children of elementary school age had no school to go to. Most of them were in poor farm areas that could not maintain a school.”
Some weeks ago, Dr. Frank P. Graham, president of the University of North Carolina, in a public address put the number of illiterate adults in the United States at 3,000,000, most of them in the rural South. He also estimated that 12,000,000 other American citizens could not read well enough to understand a newspaper, thus being, for all practical purposes, also illiterate. Finally, he gave the basic reason for these appalling statistics: that in 1930 the farmers of the United States had 9% of the national income and 31% of the children. The newly published survey of the National Education Association, Teachers in Rural Communities, covering 11,000 teachers scattered throughout the country, reveals that the composite mean salary for the group is $833, with Negro teachers getting $346, and some individual salaries running as low as $200. Two out of three of these rural teachers “support” a family. Less than half of them have either telephones or heated bedrooms, and one-third of them don’t have that rural necessity: a car. Under capitalism, you get what you pay for. When one considers that half the public school pupils of the country are educated in these rural schools, staffed by teachers paid these coolie wages, the wonder is that only 12,000,000 Americans can’t read the newspaper.
 
— And the Big City
But the farm areas, as I have just pointed out, are chronic weak spots in the school system. Things are different in the cities, perhaps? Not at all! For the last few years, the schools of Chicago, for example, have been in a state of utmost demoralization, because of the failure of the city to pay the salaries of the teachers. But Chicago’s budget troubles are well known to be due to the corruption and inefficiency of the notorious Kelly city machine—which was, by the way, supported by both the New Dealers and the Stalinists in the last mayoralty election. Granted—but how can one explain away the disaster that is about to overtake the school system of the nation’s biggest city, which for some years now has rejoiced in a comparatively progressive and enlightened city administration? The Board of Education of New York City is currently faced with the necessity of dismissing 6,819 teachers, closing down all night schools, shutting the city playgrounds and swimming pools throughout the summer, and otherwise cutting down expenses. (The New York Public Library, for lack of funds, has also drastically curtailed its services.) This is necessary because the progressive LaGuardia administration has cut $3,000,000 out of the city’s educational budget, and the reactionary State legislature has cut another $5,300,000. Between the forces of progress and the forces of reaction, it looks as though the city’s school system is about to suffer the worst dismantling in its history. The reactions of the friends of “progress” to this fact are, to say the least, naive.
“I can’t believe that the State legislature will persist in depriving our present generation of the educational facilities to which they are entitled,” says Mrs. Joanna M. Lindlof, an official of the Board of Education. “I have too much respect for their intelligence and their desire to perpetuate democratic principles.”
But, in these days of mounting deficits, democratic principles don’t cut very much ice—except when it is a matter of defending them against the fascists on the other side of the Atlantic. The legislature has wound up its session and gone home with the New York City school budget still $8,300,000 shy, and Mayor LaGuardia has been so excited about the World’s Fair and the new express highways and bridges he is building that he hasn’t had time to worry about anything so unspectacular and plebeian as the school system. But the Merchants’ Association of New York has given thought to the problem and has put forward a solution, which you’ve perhaps already guessed. Yes, it suggests a cut in teachers’ salaries.
 
Education that Does Not Educate
The immediate cause of the crisis in popular education, of course, is the simple fact that our declining capitalist economy can no longer meet the bills. But there is a more general factor, and one with ominous implications for the future of bourgeois democracy. In the last century, the more liberal and enlightened bourgeoisie looked to education as the chief means of making capitalist democracy work. Once the masses were educated, then they could vote “intelligently” and the social system would function smoothly in an ever-ascending spiral of progress. It was a thrilling vision, but the liberals, here as in other matters, stubbed their toe on the hard rock of the class struggle. Schools don’t make money, and so the bourgeoisie were never willing to pay enough in salaries and other ways to get a really good school system. More important, the educational process was stultified and deformed by the pressure of class interests. No amount of intelligence and good will on the part of “progressive” educators like John Dewey and his followers could alter the basic fact about education under capitalism: that it must be conducted primarily in the interests of the ruling class. And as that class increasingly loses its historical or social function, the educational process also degenerates.
Last year the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching published the findings of a survey its staff had conducted, over a ten-year period, of higher education in the state of Pennsylvania. This survey, based on written questionnaires given to 45,000 high school and college students, deals a death blow to the nineteenth-century faith in education as the great social panacea. The NY Times editorially termed the findings “appalling” and stated that the Carnegie Foundation had been so alarmed that it had withheld them from publication “until they had been thoroughly mulled over”. The Carnegie survey made two major discoveries:

that students intending to teach scored lower in educational tests than the average of their classmates, and that in many cases they scored lower than high school students four years below them;
 
that of 4,000 high school students who went to college, 1,000 scored lower than the average of those who did not go to college, while 3,000 of the high school students who did not go to college scored higher than the 4,000 who did.

Speaking of “the able and often brilliant young minds that are left behind because they cannot pay college bills”, the survey drew the conclusion:
“Both state subsidies and the income from endowments are today flowing in large amounts to individuals who might be replaced by more appropriate intellectual investments.”
The survey also discovered that one out of every seven of the college undergraduates examined got lower scores in their senior year than they had in their sophomore year—i.e., the longer they stayed at college, the less they knew.
“In brief,” summarized the Times, “the findings indicate that our higher education does not educate.”
  
“The Odds Are on the Cheaper Man”
But what if our schools and colleges really did educate? In the last decade, American capitalism has deteriorated to such an extent that this has become a secondary question. According to the excellent little pamphlet, Youth Want Jobs, recently issued by the Young People’s Socialist League, seven of the twenty-one million young people of the nation are unemployed. Every year two million more young men and women are graduated from our high schools and colleges, two million pouring out of the educational system to find no jobs waiting for most of them. The most intellectually ambitious youth might well ask himself why he should spend years at his books in order to fit himself—if he’s lucky—for a WPA pick and shovel job. Or in order, when and if war comes, to get his well-cultivated head blown off. As Kipling wrote of the young Englishmen of an earlier age who went out to fight the Afghans:



A great and glorious thing it is
To learn, for seven years or so,
 The Lord knows what of that and this,
Ere reckoned fit to fight the foe —
The flying bullet down the Pass,
That whistles clear: “All flesh is grass.”
No proposition Euclid wrote
No formulas the textbooks know,
Will turn the bullet from your coat,
Or ward the tulars downward blow.
 Strike hard who cares—shoot straight who can—
The odds are on the cheaper man.



Not much can be said for Kipling’s social angle, but his general idea was sound: “The odds are on the cheaper man.” And this seems to be as true of the capitalism of our time in peace as it obviously is in war. Our ruling class of late has been showing more and more signs of impatience with higher education—except for their own sons, of course. Louis M. Hacker could write a few years ago of “the unanimity with which twentieth century America accepted a collegiate education as a prime requisite for future success, whether the chosen career was to be in business, politics, or the professions”. But a recent survey of business men showed that 42% of those queried believed that a young man’s chances of success were greater if he stopped his education with high school, while only 29% came out definitely in favor of a college education.
It is not very hard to see the direction in which all this is tending. A few weeks ago a Mr. Mark Jones, who is president of the Akron Belting Co., gave a speech before a teachers’ convention in New York City.
“The American standard of living is declining,” he said quite bluntly, “the economy is in devolution, and the number of individuals who are reaching the end of their economic resources is increasing day by day.”
This Mr. Jones blamed on the “ideologies of the left”, and went on to criticize educators because they had not done a better job of dispelling certain popular “illusions” encouraged by these ideologies. These “illusions” he listed as: equality, democracy, security, collective bargaining and economic planning.
“No fantasy of dreamers,” he concluded, “has exerted such a devastating effect upon the countless millions or upon the course of human events than the illusion of equality. For more than one hundred and fifty years it has served to delude the masses into belief in the equality of individuals and races.”
Thus Mr. Mark Jones of the Akron Belting Co., and thus the more conscious members of his class. It is clear that popular education, as it has developed in the last century, has no place in their future scheme of things—even if capitalism could pay the bills. This spring of 1939 may well be a major turning-point in the history of our public education system, for it is by now a question not only as to whether a declining economy like ours can much longer afford to educate the children of the masses, but also as to whether it is desirable, from the standpoint of ruling-class interests, that this should any longer be done at all. Nor should the statement made last month by the president of the National Education Association be forgotten:
“The United States is farther from universal education, to which the public looks for preservation of the fundamental traditions of democracy, than it was one hundred years ago.”
 




Stalinist Literary Front Cracks
From the Third American Writers Congress comes news of the resignations of Babette Deutsch, and of Frances Winwar, who was a member of the executive committee of the League of American Writers, which sponsors the Congress. Both resignations are protests against the increasingly obvious corruption and reaction of the Third International and against the Communist Party’s behind-the-scenes domination of the Congress. From outside the Congress, not one but two opposition groups of writers and artists have appeared on the scene. One of these new groups is the Dewey-Hook Committee for Cultural Freedom, of which more later. The other is the League for Cultural Freedom & Socialism. Unlike the Hook Committee, the League has issued a militant and revolutionary manifesto.
It is too early to judge the response to the League’s manifesto, which is only now being published. But already it is clear that the Hook-Dewey manifesto has the Stalinists worried. Its roster of names is incomparably more distinguished than that of the signers of the call to the Third Writers Congress. The liberal N.Y. Post reprinted the manifesto in full and commented favorably on it editorially. And so it is not surprising to find both the Nation and the New Republic this week devoting major editorials to polemics against the Committee. Whatever one’s quarrels with the manifesto, and I have a good many, one can but welcome its aid in the struggle against Stalinist control of cultural activities. Once that heavy hand is lifted off our arts and letters, we can all breathe more freely.
 

The Committee for Cultural Freedom, Again
The editors of the Appeal have turned over to me the following postcard:
“Gentlemen: In one of your recent issues I am coupled with the Dies Committee. In another I am listed as a player on the Studs Lonigan team in a coming game with the Marxist Maulers. You are wrong about both items. I cannot prevent you or your Mr. MacDonald [correct spelling: Macdonald] from coupling the Committee for Cultural Freedom with the Dies Committee, since the Stalinists have already done so. But since I specifically refused to authorize the use of my name in connection with your coming game, I shall be obliged if you will stick to the facts. Yours, etc., Sidney Hook.”
I don’t know about the baseball game, although I might say that Professor Hook’s complaint is the precise opposite of mine. He was put on the team against his will, while I, in my innocence, volunteered to play again for the Studs Lonigan A.C., only to be informed, indirectly, that I have crossed the Rubicon and am now a Trotskyist and so not eligible for the Studs Lonigan team. I don’t at all object to being called a Trotskyist, but I suspect that Captain Farrell is taking this devious method to keep me off his team rather than come out with the real reason, which is my ineptness at the game. In any case, this seems to me a clear case of a writer’s being discriminated against on political grounds, or worse, and as such I bring it to the attention of Professor Hook’s committee. The whole business badly needs to be aired in public.
I am glad of the chance to explain more fully why I consider it legitimate to draw parallels, of course on a strictly limited basis between the Dies and the Dewey Committees. All men of good will, of whom I hope and believe I am one, must agree with the Dewey Committee that “totalitarianism” is an evil to be fought against. But I must still insist that the Dies Committee – one of whose hearings I attended last week – is just as explicit, no doubt for the worst sort of political reasons, in its denunciation of all forms of “dictatorship” as is the Dewey Committee. In questioning the fascistic Mr. Deatherage, Congressman Dies made it quite clear he conceives of himself as the great protector of the common man against all “extremists,” whether of left or right, and that liberty and democracy to him were dearer than pelf or his very heart’s blood. No, it all depends on the analysis one makes of the social roots and meaning of totalitarianism. And on this crucial point, the Hook-Dewey manifesto is inadequate to the point of scandal. Its basic idea is that “totalitarianism” is a foreign growth which is insinuating its tentacles into our fair American democracy: “Through subsidized propaganda, through energetic agents, through political pressure, the totalitarian states succeed in infecting other countries with their false doctrines ...” I can see less difference than I should like to between this sort of red-and-black totalitarian-baiting, and the all-black totalitarian baiting of the New Deal and its Stalinist allies. In each case, the broad Atlantic stretches between, the heroic defenders of democracy and the enemy.
The only specific reference to the internal forces that may bring about dictatorship is the single sentence: “Even in the United States, its [‘the totalitarian idea’] beginnings are all too evident in the emergence of local political dictators, the violation of civil rights, the alarming spread of phobias of hatred directed against racial, religious, and political minorities.” I think that Professor Hook and many of his co-signers would agree, in private, that this is inadequate, to say the least, and that their manifesto’s emphasis on the foreign-menace aspect of totalitarianism is distorting. I think they would agree that the great threat to freedom of any sort in this country comes not from sinister foreign plots but from the struggle of the American ruling class to maintain its rule in the face of a disintegrating economic system. Yet their manifesto is discreetly silent on this theme – the very heart of the whole business.
The only reference in the entire manifesto, and this is hardly believable when one reads some of the good left-wing names appended to it, to either the labor movement or the war issue, the single reference is this, smuggled in at the end of a paragraph: “Ominous shadows of war are gathering in our land. Behind them lurk dangers not only to a free labor movement but to a free culture.” The virtue of such a formulation, and practically its only virtue, is that James Rorty and Dorothy Thompson can agree on it. (The first sentence is particularly impregnable.) But in my opinion the price was much too high to pay, even for so valuable an autograph as that of the Sibyl of the Herald-Tribune.
 




Inventory of an Armory
Two weeks ago I wrote the editors of Time a letter asking why they took so seriously the New Masses “exposure” of General Krivitsky and pointing out that the Socialist Appeal had revealed that General Krivitsky, when he broke from the Communist Party a year and a half ago, stated that his name was Samuel Ginsberg.
A few days later, I received the following letter, signed “I. Van Meter, for the Editors of Time”:
“Thank you for your critical note in regard to Time’s report on the New Masses’ recent exposure of General Krivitsky. What you say is quite true – as far as it goes. But there are a couple of big ‘guns’ that N.M. is still sticking to. We are planning to publish your letter in the forthcoming issue, together with an Editor’s Note giving an inventory of the N.M. armory.”
In Time for June 5, my letter was printed, followed by this Editor’s Note: “Says the New Masses: Krivitsky-Ginsberg never was in Russia, never was a Soviet official, is a fake. To these guns it sticks. Time sticks to no guns but its own.” Obviously, when Time called the New Masses, it found that the ‘armory’ of data about Krivitsky-Ginsberg was a myth. The one new allegation is that the General “never was a Soviet official.” This is definite and important, unlike the New Masses’ previous ‘charges.’
But the editors of the New Masses apparently have already forgotten – Stalinists must needs have short memories these days – that in their original ‘exposure’ they wrote: “You are just the kind of adventurer the infamous Yagoda would pick for his anti-Soviet dirty work.” They must now deny – and probably will do so without turning a hair – that the infamous Yagoda was ever a Soviet official. I can imagine Joseph Freeman scratching his head: Yagoda? Name sounds familiar. Who was that fellow anyway?
 

Indiana Harbor Episode
Comrade Herbert Martin writes from East Chicago, Indiana, about the Memorial Day parade in nearby Indiana Harbor, where Inland Steel and Youngstown Sheet & Tube have major plants.
“The parade,” he writes, “was organized and managed by the local post of the American Legion and was composed of all the local patriotic and chauvinistic organizations of the community. An added and most unexpected feature of this year’s parade was the inclusion of the Indiana Harbor section of the (Stalinist-controlled) International Workers Order. After all these years, the local Stalinists have finally achieved respectability enough to march in a patriotic, jingoistic Memorial Day parade along with the American Legion, the Boy Scouts, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the National Guard ... The Stalinists, carrying American flags, marched right behind a contingent of Polish Legionaires. These Legionaires were in wartime uniforms and wore decorations from Pilsudski himself for having served in the army which fought with the White Guards, and particularly for having fought against the Red Army at the famous battle of Warsaw ... I am bringing this item to your attention for whatever interest it may be.”
The item has plenty of interest, I should say. And – speaking of the socialist movement in Poland – the Soviet press a year ago carried a number of articles slandering the memory of Rosa Luxemburg and her companion-in-arms, Leo Jogiches, actually going so far as to charge them with organizing the Social Democratic Party of Poland under instructions from the Czarist police. The general reason, of course, was that Luxemburg and Jogiches enjoy a prestige, most uncomfortable for the self-termed “heirs of Marx, Engels and Lenin,” as internationalists and revolutionists. The specific reason, I am told, was that at the time the Kremlin was preparing to rid itself, via the concentration camp and the firing squad, of a sizable group of Polish militants and revolutionists who many years ago had found sanctuary in the Soviet Union from the White Terror of Pilsudski.
 

The Axe Falls
In my column in this month’s New International I described the preparations of the ‘reactionary’ N.Y. State Legislature and the ‘progressive’ LaGuardia city administration to slash over $8,000,000 from New York City’s school budget. The Legislature has now done its dirty work, slashing an arbitrary 10% off the educational budget of every city and town in the entire state. What this will mean in New York City is clear from the statement of the local Board of Education:
“The elementary schools will suffer a cut of about $3,000,000 in services. In addition to the elimination of 200 supervisory teachers, 600 anticipated vacancies will not be filled and approximately 984 teachers will be dismissed. Kindergartens will be abolished ... Evening high schools and evening trade schools will be eliminated ... The day classes for adults in English and citizenship and the evening elementary schools will also be eliminated. Here we are terminating a long and honorable tradition of the school system in the Americanization of immigrants and the removal of adult illiteracy. The community and recreational centers and afternoon athletic centers which play such an important part in the fight against delinquency must also be abandoned ... Summer play schools and nature education will also be eliminated.”
According to the N.Y. Times, members of the Board of Education have stated that these cuts “will turn the educational clock back nearly 100 years.” Thus our capitalist society, its advance blocked by insoluble economic contradictions, begins to retrace its steps. When this sort of regression reaches a certain velocity, we call it ‘fascism.’
 




Kremlin Kultur
“It seems to me that our intelligentsia are living in a particularly happy time ... The Soviet system alone gives the intelligentsia an opportunity to unfold its creative powers ... We shall release such forces that the mere thought of it makes us breathless. (Applause.) Comrades, on December 12 we shall all vote for the Communist Party, for him who expresses the aspirations of the people, Comrade Stalin. (Stormy applause, turning into an ovation. Shouts of ‘Hurrah!’) For the Soviet intelligentsia! For the creative work of the Soviet intelligentsia!” – Speech by M. Kalinin, president of the Soviet Union, before the representatives of the Soviet Toiling Intelligentsia of Leningrad, Nov. 26, 1937. (Quoted from International Literature, No. 1, 1938.)
There is an aged joke about some state legislature which once repealed the law of gravitation. It now appears that in the Soviet Union, where anything can happen these days, something of the sort is actually in process. According to Harold Denny’s report in the N.Y. Times for June 15 last, Socialist Agriculture, the official organ of the Commissariat of Agriculture, has just published a letter from twenty-four agricultural students denouncing as “bourgeois formalism” both the Mendelian law of heredity and the theory of genes and chromosomes for which T.H. Morgan was awarded the Nobel Prize. “The concept of the gene contradicts dialectical materialism,” write the students. “We share the opinion of Academician Lysenko when he says, ‘To my mind it is high time to extract bodily Mendelianism and all its equivalents from the courses of higher educational institutions.” Denny points out that “the fact the editor of Socialist Agriculture publishes the letter under the heading, ‘CHASE FORMAL GENETICS FROM THE UNIVERSITIES’ strongly indicates that that is just what will be done – that the Mendelian law, so far as the Soviet Union is concerned, will be repealed. Unless the editor of Socialist Agriculture made a fearfully bad guess.”
The Philistinism which has laid waste Soviet culture under Stalin appears clearly in the invidious comparison the students’ letter makes between “formal” and “modernistic” genetics – which is dismissed as academic hocus-pocus, mere theory – and “practical” genetics. The “formal” school of Mendel-Morgan is led by N.I. Vavilov, an internationally famous plant expert. The “practical” school is led by T.D. Lysenko, who is in high favor with the Kremlin (and unknown outside the U.S.S.R.). Lysenko is thoroughgoing in his Philistinism, rejecting not only Mendelianism but even the science of genetics itself, which he terms “merely an amusement, like chess or football.” (N.Y. Times, Dec. 14, 1936.) Lysenko and his followers charge the Mendel-Morgan-Vavilov school with placing a “fascist” emphasis on hereditary factors, and insist that any good Bolshevik must put the emphasis on environment. Several years ago they kicked up such a row that Vavilov was arrested as a “Trotskyist” and the Seventh International Congress on Genetics, which was to be held in Moscow in the summer of 1937, was abruptly cancelled on orders from the Kremlin.
Denny comments on the “remarkable” fact that such a controversy, involving cardinal points of political doctrine, should have been allowed to drag on for three years – indeed, that it should take place at all. I agree it is remarkable, and suggest that the Kremlin finds itself in a difficult position. For the more national consciousness the Kremlin finds it expedient to stimulate, the more expedient also it must find it to emphasize heredity over environment. And so, while on the whole inclining towards Lysenko’s doctrines, the Kremlin cannot quite bring itself to summarily outlaw Vavilov.
For these very special reasons, the Vavilov school has been allowed to survive and even to dispute publicly with the dominant school. But this is a unique situation. In other fields of culture, the Kremlin never hesitates to lay down the law swiftly and with finality. In his intellectual pretensions, if not in other ways, Stalin is a twentieth-century Leonardo Da Vinci, settling out of hand the most abstruse problems of science and esthetics, turning his attention from astronomy to cubism to the expressionistic theatre – and with the most devastating effects in each field. Below I have catalogued a few of the Kremlin’s more spectacular recent exploits in such matters. They will perhaps give some faint impression of what the intellectual atmosphere must be like at present in the Workers’ Fatherland.
 
Art
“Purification of Soviet art from ‘decadent modernistic influences’ as well as the ‘sticky sweetness of romanticism’ was demanded today in Izvestia ... ‘Neither French impressionism nor post-impressionism nor bourgeois romanticism in the art of the French revolution, nor the spirit of eighteenth century painting, can harmonize with Soviet art.’ The philosophical basis of Soviet art was defined thus: ‘New ideas, new spectators and new beauty are the principal accessories of socialistic art. Its basic morality is Soviet humanism.’” – N.Y. Times, Sept. 3, 1938.
 
Astronomy
“Professor Boris Gerasimovitch, head of the Pulkovo Observatory in Leningrad, was accused today of ‘servility’ toward foreign science by the newspaper Leningrad Pravda ... Professor Gerasimovitch is the foremost astronomer of the Soviet Union, and he possesses an international reputation as one of the world’s greatest astrophysicists ... The current campaign against servility is based on the fact that many Soviet scientists first publish their works abroad.” – N.Y. Times, July 19, 1936.
“Having jailed Director Gerasimovitch of the Pulkovo Observatory and shot Director Numerov of the Astronomical Institute at Leningrad and removed and jailed so many ‘wreckers’ and ‘traitors’ of star-science that no Soviet astronomers could be sent to the recent meeting of the International Astronomical Union at Stockholm, the G.P.U. has now turned its attention to the field of Soviet Art.” – Bertram D. Wolfe, in Workers Age, November 19, 1938.
 
Cinema
“On March 17, 1937, the Central Administration of the Photo-Cinema Industry stopped the production of the much talked-of and eagerly awaited film, Bezhin Meadow, on which Sergei Eisenstein, of Potemkin fame, had been working for over two years ... In an article in Pravda, Boris Shumiatsky, the head of the moving picture industry in the U.S.S.R., charged Eisenstein with having failed to ‘learn from life’, with having placed too much faith in his own ‘scholastic profundities’ and with ... ‘harmful formalistic exercises’ ... Eisenstein admitted many of the criticisms. He admitted having been possessed of the intellectual’s quixotic illusion that revolutionary work could be done individually ... ‘Fame came early to me,’ he said. ‘I overestimated myself, and that was a major error. I never advanced beyond the stage of elemental revolutionism ...’” – Joshua Kunitz in Moscow News, March 31, 1927.
“Boris Shumiatsky, chief of the Soviet motion picture industry has been quietly removed ... The magazine Soviet Art charged that his political blindness permitted ‘savage veteran spies, Trotskyist and Bukharinist agents and hirelings of Japanese and German fascism’ to perform their wrecking deeds in the Soviet Cinema ... He was also criticised for introducing the sex element into an almost completely masculine story, Stevenson’s Treasure Island, by transforming cabin boy Jim Hawkins into Jenny Hawkins.” – N.Y. Times, Jan. 17, 1938.
 
History
“One of the biggest problems confronting the Bolshevists is to get a comprehensive history of the Communist revolution. None has yet been written, and no one appears willing to undertake the task because of the virtual certainty that whatever line of thought he pursued today would be unpopular five or ten years hence.” – N.Y. Herald-Tribune, Jan. 10, 1936.
“The heavy guns of the Russian Communist Party have now been turned on the works of the late M.N. Pokrovsky, who until his death in 1932 was almost idolized as a Marxist historian, and on the younger Soviet historians who studied under him and now are accused of being active Trotskyists ... Pravda is especially angered by the low estimate of Peter the Great made by Professor Pokrovsky and his followers ... ‘Pokrovsky’s pupils,’ writes Pravda, ‘were fertile soil for all sorts of anti-party hesitations and wanderings ... Many of them became Japanese-German-Trotskyist agents of Rightist dissenters.’” – N.Y. Times, April 18, 1937.
“Nikolai Bukharin and Alexei Rykov, former premier, are denounced along with Leon Trotsky and other one-time Soviet leaders as murderers of Mr. Kirov in a new textbook on the history of the Soviet Union just published. This is the winner of a government competition, ‘and the group of historians who composed it received a premium of 75,000 rubles ... The textbook awards considerable praise to Peter the Great ...” – N.Y. Times, Aug. 25, 1937.
“Joseph Stalin was characterized today as not only a great statesman but as a model historian and. scientist by Emil Yaroslavsky ... ‘Comrade Stalin personally executed a vast amount of the work of compiling A Short Course on the History of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union’, said Mr. Yaroslavsky ‘Isn’t our admiration stirred by this work of Stalin, for which he found time amid gigantic State work? ... The concrete instructions ol Stalin to our historians, and concrete criticisms of their mistakes – all this caused a veritable about-face in our history.’” – N.Y. Times, March 13, 1939.
 
Law
“Serious charges are faced by Eugene B. Pashukanis, until a year ago regarded as chief-theoretician of Soviet justice ... Mr. Pashukanis had taught that the State was withering away ...” – N.Y. Times, April 4, 1938.
 
Lexicography
“The Lexicographical Institute in Leningrad is one of the latest institutions in the U.S.S.R. to suffer in the constantly widening purge ... Academician N.S. Derzhavin, editor-in-chief of the dictionary, who enjoys international reputation, has been removed from his post His assistant, Professor Obnorsky and his secretary are likewise accused of ‘counter-revolution’ and ‘wrecking’ and there is no reason to doubt that all three have been arrested ... The entire work will be rewritten under the direction of new editors.
“Leningrad Pravda published a bitter attack on Professor Derzhavin, asserting he subtly introduced heretical Trotskyist theories into circulation ... It cited the definition of the word ‘émigré’ as ‘one who lives permanently outside his own country’ as a sample, pointing out indignantly that the definition ‘said not one word about the treason of such people to their Socialist fatherland’ ... Worse still, ‘comparatively few quotations from Stalin were given’ while they freely relied on quotations from Bukharin, Kamenev, and Radek.
“The editors encountered difficulties a few years ago. They issued the volume, P, with a definition of the word, ‘passport’, explaining the hateful significance of this word under the Czarist regime ... The volume, had gone to press when the Soviet Government suddenly announced the introduction of a law requiring every citizen to carry a passport.” – Manchester Guardian Weekly, August 27, 1937.
 
Literature
“The Soviet Union is purging its writers The tallest reputations to fall so far have been those of V. Kirshon and A. Afinogenov, the two best-known playwrights in the Soviet Union ... They are only two of many. The current purge ... has turned up a nest of ‘enemies of the people’ in nearly every newspaper, magazine, and publishing house ... Until the new ‘party line’ becomes clear, it would be a foolhardy Soviet writer who would advance a new idea. One of them, asked recently why he had written so little recently, quoted an old Jewish proverb: ‘While a pogrom is going on, don’t rush out on the street.’” – N.Y. Herald-Tribune, May 11, 1937.
 
Music
“Dimitri Shostakovitch officially went into eclipse today as the Soviet Union’s favorite living composer ... Pravda branded his music as ‘unSoviet, unwholesome, cheap, eccentric, tuneless and Leftist’ and pleaded for music with a tune to it that one could whistle on the way home ... His ballet, Limpid Stream, was removed from the repertory of the Bolshoi Theatre. His opera, Lady Macbeth of Mensk, was cancelled on the eve of its opening in a theatre that had been rehearsing it for months.” – N.Y. Times, Feb. 14, 1936.
“Joseph Stalin ... yesterday attended the revised version of Glinka’s nineteenth century patriotic opera, Susanin ... The original version, entitled, A Life for the Czar, glorified Czarism ... The revised version retains the famous finale music but changes the words from ‘Glory, glory to the Czar!’ to ‘Glory, glory to the fatherland!’ ... Mr. Stalin repeatedly applauded his approval.” – N.Y. Times, April 4, 1939.
 
Philosophy
“Professor Shatkin, who said in a lecture at the Moscow Power Institute that Aristotle had laid down the fundamental principles of Menshevism and that Plato was the father of fascism, has been summarily removed ... This action was followed by a full faculty meeting at which both the Communist Party and the Young Communist organization were represented, as well as the administration of the Commissariat of Heavy Industry ...” – N.Y. Times, Oct. 22, 1938.
Theatre
“Vsevolod E. Meyerhold, head of the famous theatre bearing his name and long revered by Leftist dramatic groups abroad as a prophet of the revolutionary theatre, has received a terrific, drubbing from Platon Kerzhentseff, chairman of the arts committee of the Council of People’s Commissars ... Meyerhold’s first play in 1920, after he organized his new theatre, Mr. Kerzhentseff says, had a Menshevist traitor for a hero and the second was dedicated to Leon Trotsky.” – N.Y. Times, Dec. 18, 1937.
“The long-expected axe fell today on V.E. Meyerhold ... The arts committee of the Council of People’s Commissars ordered his theatre dissolved and members of his acting company transferred to other theatres ... The arts committee charged ... the Meyerhold Theatre throughout its existence was unable to free itself from the utterly bourgeois, formalistic positions alien to Soviet art, had distorted the classics for the sake of Leftist tricks, and formalistic stunts, and had failed in the production of Soviet plays, such few as it had produced being saturated with ambiguity, even downright.and anti-Soviet sneers.” – N.Y. Times, Jan. 8, 1938.
 
Et Cetera: Anthropology, Archaeology, Buddhist Lore, Ethnography and Soil Culture
“The directorate of the All-Union Academy of Science has recommended the immediate expulsion in disgrace of Nikolai Bukharin ... The grounds given were that Bukharin presided over the most dangerous counter-revolutionary nest within the academy. According to the report of the permanent secretary, N.P. Gorbunov, who presented the expulsion resolution, many departments of the academy were riddled with counter-revolutionary tendencies which disrupted the work of the scientific institutions ... Mr. Gorbunov’s report specifically condemned the Pulkavo Observatory ... the Soil Institute, Literature Institute, Law Institute, the Institute of Buddhist Lore, which was accused of publishing an organ of the Buddhist lamaist religion, and the Institutes of Archaeology, Anthropology and Ethnography ... He attacked Germany for expelling her best scientists and falsifying science ...” – N.Y. Times, May 21, 1937.
 



Editor:
On behalf of the League for Cultural Freedom and Socialism, I must repudiate the headline description of our League which recently appeared in the Appeal. The League is “Anti-Stalinist” but by no means “Anti-Hook” in the same sense. There is no reference to the Dewey-Hook Committee in our entire manifesto. There are major differences of principle between the two manifestos, but certainly no such head-on collision as the fevered imagination of your headline writer conjured up. Thank you for printing this correction in an early issue.



 


Sincerely
Dwight Macdonald
Acting Secretary

How George Dobbin Lost His Job
I am turning over this column to a guest conductor: George Dobbin, one of the Southern workers who tell their life stories in These Are Our Lives, an extremely interesting compilation made by the Federal Writers Project and published by the University of North Carolina Press. The story begin in the boom years of the War:
“Mills was beginnin’ to pay good,” George continued. “It wa’n’t long till I was makin’ $20 a week.”
“We done some good livin’ then,” Sally remarked. “It seemed like we never had to study and contrive so hard. I could buy all the milk my children needed.”
“Groceries kept agoin’ up,” George began again, “and they took up most of the wages, but then we did have enough to eat.”
“In 1919 we moved to Durham and first thing I knowed I was makin’ from 25 to 35 dollars a week. Times stayed good with us up to ’21. When I say times was good, I don’t meant we done no fancy livin’ atall but we sat down to the table three times a day and always found somethin’ on it.
“Then one day I went in the mill and seen a notice tellin’ of a twenty-five percent cut and a shortenin’ of time to three days a week. Hard times really ‘set in like always but groceries never come down accordin’ to the cut.”
“Them was miserable days for us,” Sally declared, “and many a time my little ones cried for milk.”
“And when it began to look like the livin’ wa’n’t worth the worry of gettin’ along I lost my job complete – left without ary little piece of a job.
“It was human kindness that caused me to lose it too. A body is hard put to it to understand how kindness can work against him sometimes but it sure happens. Word got out amongst the neighbors that we was havin’ a struggle gettin’ along with me one workin’ and seven children lookin’ to me for a livin’. First thing we knowed a woman come out and set to talk awhile with my wife. She asked her how we managed to live on what I made and the old lady answered we done the best we could. At different times three women come out and done just about such talk as the first one, and Sally, she answered ‘em all alike, but not ary times did she ever ask help of ‘em. But it wasn’t long till baskets of groceries started comin’ to us and it seemed just like manna from heaven. That’s been goin’ on a few weeks when my boss told me Mr. Wilder, the superintendent, wanted to see me.
“Soon as I could I went to Mr. Wilder’s office and told him Mr. Henry said he wanted to see me. He answered right quick, ‘Yes, Dobbin, I did. The comp’ny’s decided all who can’t live sumptuous on what they make at this mill is to be given ten-day notice. I’m givin’ you yores now.”
“‘But Mr. Wilder,’ I says, ‘I don’t understand what’s causin’ this. I have never raised one word of complaint against this mill.’
“‘Mr. Dobbin, it’s awful knockin’ on the mill,’ he says, ‘to have folks workin’ for this company that calls on the welfare and the Salvation Army for help. We don’t like to have the Salvation Army callin’ up this office and tellin’ us they’d like a contribution from us to help them take care of our hands.’
“I looked at Mr. Wilder settin’ there behind his desk and I knowed he couldn’t help feelin’ I was tellin’ the truth when I spoke. ‘Before God, Mr. Wilder,’ I said, ‘to my ricollection I’ve never spoke to a Salvation Army man or woman in my life and I’ve never been to no organization to ask for help.’
“‘But you’ve been agettin’ help, ain’t you?’ he asked.
“‘I’ve got help and I highly appreciate it,’ I said. ‘It’s kept my children from goin’ hungry.’
“‘You’ve got your notice,’ he answered me.”
 



Epilogue
The epilogue to the role played by the “democratic” powers in the Spanish tragedy has been pronounced by Alexander Wilbourne Weddell, a sixty-three-year old Virginia gentleman who recently arrived to take up his residence in Burgos. To the press of Generalissimo Franco he said:
“There existed, it is true, two waves of propaganda in my country until recently, but I hope the American people will understand the reality of this historic moment. The Spanish people must not doubt that in the United States there exists a deep admiration for the character of this great country. Americans understand the enormous difficulties that must be experienced by a nation that has brought to a victorious conclusion a war of the magnitude of the Spanish crusade.”
The Generalissimo’s journalists commented on these fine words with more than ordinary jubilation, for the speaker is the new ambassador to Burgos from the United States of America.
 
Frozen Surplus Value
If architecture in general is frozen music, the Soviet building at the New York World’s Fair might be called frozen surplus value. It is not pleasant, indeed, to think how much surplus value sweated out of the Russian masses this huge pile of multi-colored marble represents. The Soviet workers may grumble about scanty food and shoes that fall apart in the rain, they may complain – to themselves, that is – about the Stakhanovite speed-up system and the reintroduction of the “work-passport” of Czarist times, but they must admit the Kremlin spares no expense to glorify “their” state at capitalist expositions. In Paris two years ago, the Soviet pavilion was outshone in costly elegance only by that of Nazi Germany. A big feature of the exhibit there, and one which has been transported to the New York show, is a huge map of the workers’ fatherland done in gold and silver and lapus lazuli, with cities and other points of interest picked out in precious jewels. (The story is told of an elderly French peasant woman, in starched cap and wide peasant skirt, who halted before this example of proletarian art, examined it a moment and then walked away, muttering “Bah! Hypocrites!” and spitting indignantly.)
The Soviet building is unquestionably one of the major sensations at the New York fair. Built entirely of marble, it is the only permanent building in the international area, and will be taken apart stone by stone and transported back to Russia, for what purpose God only knows. The huge stainless steel statue of a young man bearing aloft a red star can be seen from almost any part of the fair grounds, and for a time threatened to undermine our system of government. Patriotic citizens, chiefly of the Roman Catholic persuasion, discovered that the red star was higher than any American flag in the whole place. Careful measurements, however, showed that the top of the parachute jump in the amusement area was just one foot higher than the star, and the stability of American institutions was restored when a retired Army officer, amid solemn ceremonies, climbed to the topmost pinnacle of the parachute jump and affixed thereto the stars and stripes. So now Old Glory waves a good twelve inches above the symbol of red revolution, and all is well.
The thing that impressed me the most about the Soviet building – aside from the ugliness of its liver-red and multi-colored marble trim and the brutal heaviness of its lines – was the collection of highly dubious statements which appeared, in all the permanence of bronze and graven stone, on every wall, inside and out.
“FOR THE USSR SOCIALISM IS SOMETHING ALREADY ACHIEVED AND WON. – STALIN.”
“THE USSR IS A SOCIALIST STATE OF WORKERS AND PEASANTS.”
“SOCIALISM AND DEMOCRACY ARE INVINCIBLE. – STALIN.”
“LABOR IN THE USSR IS A MATTER OF HONOR, A MATTER OF GLORY, A MATTER OF VALOR AND HEROISM.”
(I can agree partially with the last statement: labor in the USSR is certainly not a matter of such vulgar materialistic things as beefsteaks and warm clothes.) These inscriptions seemed to me to have a rather frantic air. They were so flat and final, so positive in their assertions. Might there possibly be a little self-reassurance here, a little whistling in the dark?
This game of inscriptions, furthermore, can be played at by others as well. In the building consecrated to the United States Steel Corporation, I read another series of doubtful assertions rendered in the boldest and most unequivocal of letters:
“THE US STEEL CORPORATION CONTRIBUTES TO NATIONAL WELFARE.”
“THE US STEEL CORPORATION PIONEERS TECHNICAL PROGRESS.”
“THE US STEEL CORPORATION PROMOTES INDUSTRIAL STABILITY.”
And in the Italian building I found Il Duce equally insistent.
“THE INTELLIGENT CAPITALISTS ARE NOT ONLY INTERESTED IN SALARIES BUT ALSO IN HOUSES, SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS AND SPORTING CAMPS FOR THEIR WORKERS. – MUSSOLINI.”
“PER UNA PIU ALTA GIUSTIZIA SOCIALE – M.”
 
Miscellany
I have been looking through Earl Browder’s latest literary effort, The 1940 Elections: How the People Can Win, in the hope that he would explain how “the people” can lose an election which is decided by the majority of their votes. So far I have found no explanation, but I have run across what is undoubtedly the Amalgam of the Month, namely: “Trotskyites, Lovenstoneites, spies, detectives, and agents-provocateur ...” Where would you put store detectives, comrade Browder?

The level of the attacks that are being made on the Federal Arts Projects is well expressed by the statement a certain Mr. Walton, formerly an official in the Federal Theatre in New York, made to a congressional committee the other day. “The present set-up,” said Mr. Walton, “is in my opinion nothing more or less than a fence to sow
the seeds of communism. Of course, every play does not carry that message. They are too clever for that. But you must bear in mind that the theatre for centuries has been used to sway public opinion. Voltaire once wrote a play that started the French revolution.” Mr. Walton’s history is as mixed as his metaphors. It was Beaumarchais, not Voltaire, whose Marriage of Figaro “started” the revolution.

Having worked out the horoscopes of William Green, John L. Lewis, Heywood Broun, Harry Bridges, William Z. Foster and Earl Browder, Horoscope states: “None of these leaders have horoscopes that would appear to warrant the Red Scare that is generally broadcast with the mention of their names. From the capitalistic point of view, the labor movement is ‘safe’ so long as it is in their hands.” Maybe there’s something to this astrology after all.

Mr. and Mrs. Albert H. Wiggin have given to the Greenwich (Conn.) Boys Club Association the funds to build a modern club house, with the general idea, according to Mr. Wiggin’s statement to the press of “building character for citizenship”. The last time Mr. Wiggin’s name got in the headlines was in connection with the several million dollars he had agreed to pay the stockholders of the Chase National Bank, who were suing him because of a number of rather peculiar transactions he put through during his term of office as president of that institution.

The Nazi drive for more children, whether begotten in or out of holy wedlock, seems to have born unexpected and unwelcome fruit. According to Time, for June 5:
“In the midst of spring fervor, Nazi health authorities publicized an unbelievable figure: 76% of all young men between 20 and 29, they said, proved, when examined for military purposes, jobs, or party membership, to be suffering from syphilis.”
 
Big Steel Swings Right
When the US Steel Corporation in March 1937 suddenly and unexpectedly signed a contract with the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, the indignation of the rest of the industry was extreme. The barons of Little Steel sounded like so many Nation editors on the subject of the Munich Pact, another great “betrayal”. Myron Taylor, the then chairman of the Steel Corporation, was cast in the role of the traitorous Chamberlain. A few months later, Little Steel showed that some steel men have principles when it bloodily smashed the Little Steel Strike, throwing the advancing CIO movement back on its haunches – where it has remained ever since. Myron Taylor was succeeded by the energetic and dashing young E.R. Stettinius, Jr., who at once established close contacts with various young New Dealers, especially those on the Monopoly Committee. Last summer the Steel Corporation went to Munich once more, again enraging its competitors by a major appeasement gesture towards the New Deal. It announced the abandonment of the basing price system, which for some three decades had been under constant attack by consumer and governmental organizations.
In the introduction last fall to Guerin’s Fascism and Big Business, I pointed out that the Steel Corporation was temporarily co-operating with the New Deal for the same reason German heavy industry in the Twenties cooperated with the Weimar Republic: because it was in the midst of a vast rationalization process, for which it needed a period of peace. But I predicted that “the Steel Corporation will find itself before long with a magnificent, enormous and highly efficient productive mechanism – and no market for its goods. Nor it there any reason to expect its directors to act differently when this happens, than their German colleagues did.” The Corporation’s reorganization program seems now about complete, steel production for months has been fluctuating between 45% and 55% of capacity, the CIO is in retreat, and so the directors of the Corporation are cutting their bonds with the New Deal.
The first open indication was the appearance of Walter Tower, executive secretary of the American Iron & Steel Institute, before the Senate subcommittee which has been hearing proposals for amending the Wagner Act. There is nothing startling about Mr. Towers’ seven proposals. They were set to the same music as most business suggestions for “reforming” the Wagner Act. The news was that Mr. Towers’ proposals had been previously unanimously approved by the directors of the Iron & Steel Institute, and that among these directors were four officials of the Steel Corporation. So deeply had the Corporation’s. signing up with the SWOC cleft the industry that this was actually the first time since March, 1937, that the Institute had been able to make any general statement on labor policy.
The ranks of the steel industry are evidently closing. The corporation’s break on price policy has had such a disturbing effect on the complex and normally rigid steel price structure, and profits in the past year have dropped so alarmingly, that this concession to the New Deal seems also likely to be withdrawn. From the White House, too, have recently come some plain indications that the period of big business “appeasement” has ended. The Steel Corporation’s new policy is one of many signs of a new and major shift in the ever-changing relationships of the New Deal with the various sections of the bourgeoisie. Next month I intend to attempt an analysis of the current trend of these relationships.
 
Our Master Minds in Action
The new president of the American Iron & Steel Institute is Ernest T. Weir, guiding genius of National Steel Co. To commemorate his accession to the supreme leadership of the mighty steel industry, I reproduce below a portion of the testimony he gave on March 3, 1938, before the LaFollette Civil Liberties Committee. Before our excerpt begins, Mr. Weir has been complaining bitterly about what he terms an “anti-industry” movement that is gnawing at the wellsprings of our democracy. Senator Thomas of the LaFollette Committee is trying to find out what he meant, exactly:
SENATOR THOMAS: Where do you find this anti-industry movement in America?
MR. WEIR: Well, it is general, Senator.
SENATOR THOMAS: General?
MR. WEIR: Yes, you read about it in the newspapers, you hear it discussed over the radio.
SENATOR THOMAS: Name a newspaper that is against American industry.
MR. WEIR: I do not say they are against American industry. They may give some misrepresentation of facts without being against American industry basically.
SENATOR THOMAS: Illustrate ...
MR. WEIR: You are asking me in detail about a very broad subject. If you want me to submit –
SENATOR THOMAS (interposing): Is there any one in the State of Utah that wants to destroy Utah industry?
MR. WEIR: I don’t know; I cannot answer that. That is a broad question.
SENATOR THOMAS: Do you think the Governor would want to destroy Utah industry?
MR. WEIR: Anybody in Utah?
SENATOR THOMAS: Yes, the Governor of Utah.
MR. WEIR: I certainly would not think so.
SENATOR THOMAS: Do you think the Utah Legislature would want destroy Utah industry?
MR. WEIR: I certainly would not think so.
SENATOR THOMAS: Do you think there is a paper in the State of Utah that wants to destroy Utah?
MR. WEIR: I don’t know.
SENATOR THOMAS: You don’t know?
MR. WEIR: Of course not. I am not familiar with the State of Utah; I am not familiar with the publications. If there is a publication in the State of Utah such as the Daily Worker, just submitted, I would think very definitely that was their intention to destroy the standard of government in the State of Utah. That is my own opinion.
SENATOR THOMAS: The standard of government is quite different from industry, is it not?
MR. WEIR: I do not understand your question ... You asked me, as I understood it, if there was anybody in the State of Utah that wanted to destroy the government of Utah.
SENATOR THOMAS: No; to destroy industry in Utah. Do you think there is anybody in Utah that wants to destroy the government in Utah?
MR. WEIR: I would not think so; I don’t know. You know Utah is rather a good-sized state. I don’t know. There may be.
SENATOR THOMAS: You are not serious about that? You do not think that we actually, out there in Utah, have to carry on a campaign so that people won’t destroy our State?
MR. WEIR: Senator, I know nothing whatever about the State of Utah. What I do know something about is the state of industry, and the necessities of industry, the operations of industry. I think I know something about them. As to the State of Utah, I know nothing.
 




Information, Please
For some time now we have been told by the press of the Socialist Workers Party that the fate of the workers of the world turns to a large extent on how the crucial situation in France develops. I agree entirely. But I have been, to put it mildly, disappointed with the way the S.W.P. press has covered the French front. The recent developments in the P.S.O.P. and the relation of the P.O.I., the London Bureau and the Fourth International, to them – this most central of all themes has been touched on only in the most gingerly way. The cut-and-dried account of the P.S.O.P. congress which was printed in the Appeal of June 23 – the entire story being told, in the most unenlightening and perfunctory way, in about 500 words – this is a recent case in point. I don’t see why the Appeal can’t find a Paris correspondent who will send in regular articles interpreting such things as the Stalinists’ attitude toward the Daladier regime, the latest tendencies in the P.S.O.P., the rumored right-wing split in the French C.P., and so on. I realize that the French situation, from the standpoint of the Fourth International, is at present both delicate and complex. But that seems to me all the more reason why it should be fully discussed in the Appeal. Ostriches, not revolutionists, hide their heads in the sand.
 

Add: Kremlin Kultur
There have been objections to my inclusion of Eisenstein, Shostakovich and Meyerhold in last week’s “agony column” on the grounds that, since the date of the news stories I quoted, all three of these artists have been taken back into official favor. As for the first two, the price they have paid for reinstatement in the Kremlin’s good graces is the abandonment of their experimental techniques in order to turn out the most banal and conservative work (Eisenstein’s Alexander Nevsky; Shostakovich’s latest symphony), utterly lacking in the qualities that made them world-famous. As for Meyerhold, I quote from today’s N.Y. Times:
“MOSCOW, June 23 – Vsevolod Meyerhold ... was taken from his Moscow home by secret police night before last and locked in a cell at Lubyanka prison. ... His arrest surprised Soviet stage and literary circles because recently he seemed to be coming back gradually into favor.”
 

“Egyptian Socialism”
In the May issue of Jewish Frontier there is an extremely interesting article by Salomon Schwartz on Social Legislation in the Soviet Union. Schwartz begins, with a point which fits neatly into the thesis of Trotsky’s recent article in the New International: namely, that the Soviet bureaucracy which used to masquerade as part of the working class, in the last year has openly asserted its differentiation from the workers. They don’t, of course, call themselves “bureaucrats”. No, the term the press now uses for these gentlemen is – “the intelligentsia”!
“Under the banner of the ‘intelligentsia’,” writes Schwartz, “there is being consummated a process which has practically nothing to do with that name. That process is the social self-assertion of the upper stratum of the Party and Soviet bureaucracy and its ‘liberation’ from the intimate ties of the proletarian ideology.”
Early last December the press began printing scores of letters from Stakhonovites, Udarniks, straw bosses, and, of course, ‘intelligentsia’, ‘exposing’ lax discipline and low production in the factories and ‘demanding’ strict laws be passed to remedy this. In the Ural machine plant, for instance, where this ‘spontaneous’ movement of protest began, Pravda indignantly reported that in the eleven months up to last December, there had been no less than 7,978 cases of unexcused absences from work. Schwartz points out, however, that actually this represents only an average absence per worker of one-half day a year.
These letters got action at once. (The pen is mightier than the sword!) Without consulting the much-publicized Soviet parliament, a flat violation of the much-publicized Soviet constitution, the Kremlin in quick succession put through a series of labor regulations of unprecedented severity. On December 20 it decreed the introduction of the “work passport”, that ultimate in control of the working class, first introduced by Napoleon III in 1854 as the “livret ouvrier”, and the very same sort of “fink book” as the New Deal’s Maritime Commission, backed up by the Kremlin’s American agents, is now trying to impose on American seamen. Hitler re-introduced it into Germany in 1935. During the whole campaign of letters-to-the-editor, by the way, no one dared suggest this work-book idea, and it was only after the Kremlin had issued its decree that its “innumerable spokesmen began to vie with each other in glorifying the new regulation.”
More edicts were issued on December 28 last, again without consulting any one – parliament, trade unions, even the Party – outside the top ranks of the Kremlin bureaucracy. These greatly extended the time a worker must be employed in a plant before he becomes eligible for sick benefits, cut down the period expectant mothers were given time off with pay from eight weeks before and eight weeks after the birth to five weeks before and four weeks after, required workers to give one month’s (instead of one day’s) notice before quitting a job, and ordered heads of factories, on pain of severe punishment, to discharge at once any worker who, without valid excuse, is either absent from work or over twenty-minutes late at any time. Finally, all workers who give up their jobs, whether they are fired or whether they leave of their own free will, are to be automatically dispossessed from their homes within ten days, regardless of whether the Housing Bureau has provided another dwelling for them. Thus the Soviet worker is shackled hand and foot to his job, a cog in the apparatus of Soviet production. The “socialism” Stalin is building in one country is coming to have an increasingly Egyptian flavor to it.
 




For four days I have spent most of my waking hours – and a few of the sleeping hours as well! – at Irving Plaza listening in on the second national convention of the Socialist Workers Party. Although I am not a member of the S.W.P., as a regular contributor to the Appeal, I was invited to sit in on the sessions. It was an enlightening, and heartening, experience.
From the convention I carried away chiefly an impression of youth – the average age of the delegates was announced as twenty-eight and a half years – and seriousness. This was no convention of middle-aged cafeteria-table Marxists, splitting fine points of dialectics over the coffee cups. In fact, the convention seemed to indicate that the S.W.P. has struck its roots far deeper into the American working class than I had supposed. These were for the most part working class leaders – in steel, in auto, in rubber, in the maritime field, among the unemployed. There were also, of course, a number of middle-class delegates as well – teachers, journalists, even an accountant or two.
But whatever their class origin, the delegates all quite clearly took with the utmost seriousness the sharpening crisis of American capitalism and the imminent threat of war. The high point of the convention, in many ways, was Cannon’s brilliant speech on the war question, and the discussion from the floor that followed it.
The convention revolved around a central axis: the problem of changing the S.W.P. from a propaganda-discussion sect into a mass party, how to turn the party’s face toward the masses. The level of the discussion was extremely high, and a great many excellent suggestions and illuminating bits of data came from the delegates’ comments. So far as I could see, the sessions were conducted in completely democratic fashion. I was particularly interested in the discussion on the press, with its constant hammering on the point that the Appeal must be written in simpler language, that its articles must be shorter, more concrete, and that it must be changed from a journal of comment into what Burnham called “a campaign paper”, concentrating its fire on certain definite objectives. Much the best suggestion seemed to me to be that there should be more letters and news stories from workers in the field, and less journalistic comment written in the editorial office. The responsibility for the lack of original material from the field is hard to place. The Appeal staff pointed out that their correspondents out of New York just didn’t write in usable stuff, while, on the other hand, comrades from Chicago and from St. Paul charged that the Appeal had failed to print what they had sent in. Whatever the reasons, the lack of first-hand stories from the field is the glaring weakness of the Appeal today.
 

Two Dangers
The convention illustrated pretty well the two great dangers in this transformation of the S.W.P. into a mass party. On the one hand, there are still some bad hangovers from the old propaganda-sect days, not so much in the rank and file as in the top leadership. The sessions, for example, all began from forty-five minutes to almost two hours late. On Tuesday, the last day, when many extremely important items on the agenda had not yet been taken up, the session, scheduled for ten a.m., did not begin until ten minutes to twelve. As a result, the unemployment discussion was cut so short as to be of little value, and the convention never did get around to several important items on the agenda. There was not the slightest reason, except sloppy management, that the report on unemployment could not have been presented as scheduled at ten.
I am told that at the last convention, in Chicago, meetings began promptly on time. The atmosphere of New York doesn’t seem to demoralize the bourgeoisie – so far as I know, banks open promptly at nine and close promptly at three, and directors’ meetings begin on the dot – but it has a terrible effect on the leaders of the S.W.P.
In the old days, punctuality was a minor virtue: it didn’t make much difference whether an all-day discussion on the nature of the Soviet state began on the minute or not. But in an active mass party, punctuality is a minimum requirement. How can people make a revolution who can’t even make an appointment?
The other danger comes from just the opposite quarter. If the top leadership is, understandably enough, not yet free of the attitudes of the old discussion-group days, the new rank-and-file is open to another disease. It was expressed in more than one contemptuous allusion to “petty bourgeois intellectuals”. It also came out in a tendency to set the rest of the country in opposition to New York City – a false and fatal antagonism. Several speakers seemed to think of New York as a nest of sterile, isolated, long-haired and long-winded intellectuals for whom every honest worker can have nothing but contempt. This anti-intellectual, anti-New York attitude – which unhappily finds some real justification in the hangovers from the party’s sectarian past I have mentioned above – seems to me to be the rankest sort of Philistinism. I see nothing immoral about brains. On the contrary, a party obviously needs all the brains, both practical and theoretical, it can command. To damn all theoretical intelligence because intellectuals have their typical weaknesses, is to throw out the baby with the bath.
It remains to be seen whether these defects will be remedied. The intelligence and seriousness of the delegates, and their closeness to the masses – all this seems to promise that they will.
 




Taxes and the New Deal
Taxation is a notoriously dull subject. Stuffy Republican journals print lengthy articles about it, but the left-wing press rarely gives any attention to the subject. This would seem to be a great mistake, for of all the tricks in the bag of that master shell-game politician, Franklin D. Roosevelt, of all his ingenious devices for fooling the masses, taxation is in some ways the most effective.
A recent Gallup poll found that one out of every four persons asked actually thought he paid no taxes at all. No less than 71% of these persons who thought they paid no taxes said they were for Roosevelt – as against 54% of those who knew they were paying taxes. In other words, the less a citizen knows about taxation, the better he likes the New Deal.
There is a general impression, especially among the lower income groups, that the New Deal “soaks the rich”, that it has been redistributing national purchasing power by collecting taxes from corporations and millionaires and spreading these billions out over the farmers, workers, unemployed. Actually, the New Deal has financed its spending programs not by heavy taxes on the rich – as, for example, the British Government has been doing ever since the war – but by selling Government bonds and notes to the banks. This amounts to postponing the whole question as to what class shall pay for the New Deal’s social reforms, since the bonds will not have to be paid off for many years.
But this is just the beginning of the story. Most of those who told the Gallup investigators they paid no taxes were earning $20 a week or less. Calculations show that a person getting $20 a week pays taxes today of no less than $100 a year – or five weeks’ pay. The reason, of course, these people thought they were not being taxed was that they paid no income taxes or other direct taxes. The joker in the deck, the elusive pea under the shell that Franklin D. manipulates so cleverly, is “hidden” taxation levied on consumption: sales taxes, tobacco, liquor, gasoline, and a thousand and one other taxes.
The wartime taxes on amusements, playing cards, etc., first awakened legislators to this rich mine of revenue. Consumption taxes have two great advantages: they bear most heavily on the masses, and hence are popular with the ruling class; and yet, extorted in driblets of pennies and usually without the consumer being aware of them, they awaken no great popular protest.
Pennies become dollars very fast, however, in this game. The Northwestern National Life Insurance Co. has published a table of indirect taxes paid by an average family living on $150 a month ($1,800 a year):

Corporations: $1,300,000,000 – Consumers: $3,400,000,000
Of the $14,200,000,000 taxes collected by local, state and national governments last year, no less than $8,000,000,000 was in the form of these hidden, indirect taxes. (The National Consumers Tax Commission, as reported in the N.Y. Times of June 19, last.) It is true that local and state governments have made even greater use of these “hidden” taxes than has the New Deal, but F.D.R. is learning fast.
In Workers Age of June 24 last, Cecil Owen, publicity director for Labor’s Non-Partisan League, pointed out that in 1929 corporations paid $1,200,000,000 in Federal taxes while consumers paid $1,000,000. In 1938, after six years of New Deal “reform”, corporations paid $1,300,000,000 and consumers $3,400,000,000. True, corporations pay less today because they are taxed on profits and profits are less than in 1929.
But the point is that the New Deal has raised the rates of taxation on business very little. For all the outcry about the undistributed profits tax, it produced a mere $75,000,000 a year and the effect of its recent repeal by Congress has been practically nil either on business or on Federal revenues. On the other hand, the New Deal has piled on the hidden taxes to a towering total. Tobacco and liquor alone last year yielded almost as much revenue as the entire corporation tax.
But the real discovery of Franklin D. is the payroll tax now being collected under the pretense of setting up a “reserve fund” for the old age and unemployment insurance provisions of the Social Security Act. As John T. Flynn demonstrated in The Social Security Reserve Swindle, an excellent article that recently appeared in Harpers, these payroll taxes are actually being used to pay the current expenses of the Federal government, and the “reserve” idea is a gigantic hoax and fraud. The swindle is so barefaced, indeed, that the New Deal has been forced to back down a bit: Congress recently was forced, by mounting public protests, to lower the rate of these taxes. The daring and scope of this particular bit of shell-game New Deal politics can be grasped if one remembers that last year these payroll taxes yielded no less than $1,500,000,000, practically all of which was at once spent for current governmental expenses. And the rates, even after the recent lowering, are adjusted so that this sum will increase greatly in the next few decades.
 




Bank Report
The big news in the press this week, bigger than Danzig, bigger than the W.P.A. strike, is a table buried in the financial pages of the N.Y. Times under the not-too-thrilling headline: FEDERAL LOANS UP IN BANK PORTFOLIOS. The table, based on the newly issued second-quarter reports of the fifteen largest Wall Street banks, shows the percentages of these banks’ total assets invested in various ways. it is worth reproducing:

  35%

The big news here is not something unexpected has happened, not “MAN BITES DOG”, for example, but precisely “DOG BITES MAN – AGAIN!” A trend which was alarming enough – to the bourgeoisie – a year ago has become even more serious in the past year.
Banks make money – and keep the capitalist system going – either by loaning their funds to business men or by investing them in business enterprises. But this table shows us that both loans and investments have in the last year shrunk even beow the alarmingly – again, to the bourgeoisie – low levels of 1938. On the other hand, there has been a decided rise in the percentage of assets held in the form of cash – that is, lying idle in the vaults, producing no income for the banks or for any one else – and in Government securities, which yield a very low rate of interest.
In short, only a little over one-fourth of these great banks’ total resources of $15,240,000,000 is at present invested in profit-making enterprises. The rest is either idle or else is siphoned out of the field of private enterprise completely into Government securities.
 

Bond Addicts
The banks aren’t making much money, but there is a great deal more to it than that. Their economic base has been shifted in the last ten years from private to state capitalism, from business enterprise to government enterprise. In 1930, the national banks of the country had $21,600,000,000 out on loan to their customers, and $4,106,006,000 invested in government securities. In 1937, they had $12,700,000,000 out on loan, and $12,300,000,000 in Government securities.
Small wonder that the conservative Senator Barbour, of New Jersey, recently described the banks as “bond addicts”, which have been “all but ruined as lending agencies”. The Senator admitted, sadly, that no outlet for bank funds exists in private industry, and that the banks, therefore, “are helpless and. cannot break the habit of putting surplus funds into Federal security issues.”
The resulting situation is a curious one indeed. The huge annual deficits of the New Deal have been met not by increased taxation but by selling government bonds and short-term notes to the banks. Thus the New Deal has borrowed the money it needed for its spending programs from those very citadels of finance capitalism most violently opposed to any such program. The banks have lent the money simply because there has literally been nowhere else – except a safe deposit vault – they could put it. The New Deal is dependent on the banks, and the banks are dependent on the New Deal. So far, the political implications of this increasingly closer relationship between finance capital and the state have remained simply – implications. But it is in this sector that we may expect, in the future, especially clear warning signals of the approach of an American form of fascism.
 

Money Goes on Relief
There are two major indexes of the success of the New Deal’s attempt to save capitalist democracy: idle men and idle money. The last two years have been heart-breaking ones for the New Dealers because, after some progress in 1935–6, the whole business collapsed again, and unemployment and excess bank reserves have been steadily mounting ever since. Unless new fields for profitable private investment are opened up in a hurry, the outlook for capitalism as we know it is not bright. The latest S.E.C. report on new security issues, for May of this year, is not encouraging. Only $31,200,000 in all were registered, only a little more than half the May 1938 figure – and over half of this measly $31,200,000 was accounted for by new investment trusts, which means a mere reshuffling of existing investments rather than creation of new outlets.
Meanwhile, money keeps piling up in the banks just as new thousands keep swelling the ranks of the unemployed. In the last three months alone, deposits of the fifteen largest Wall Street banks jumped 6%. Chase National, which a year or so ago outstripped London’s great Midland Bank to become the world’s biggest bank, has just reported an all-time high of almost $3,000,000,000 resources, which is $500,000,000 more than it had last year. Chicago has two billion dollar banks for the first time in its history. And while deposits mount, loans dwindle, investment in new enterprises has practically dried up. These vast accumulations of capital once were reservoirs from which money flowed to turn the wheels of tens of thousands of profit-making enterprises. They have become in our day stagnant pools, breeding places of disease for the whole capitalist system.
 




Franklin D. Roosevelt, Union Buster
As the Appeal has pointed out editorially, the recent
announcement of Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold that the
Department of Justice is preparing to prosecute trade unions under
the anti-trust laws, is a frontal attack on the American labor
movement. This is the first time in several decades that the
Department of Justice has dared thus to pervert the anti-trust laws.
It marks a new high point in the War Deal’s current offensive
against workers’ organizations. First the trial of scores of
WPA strikers in Minneapolis, then the Sioux City frame-up of
teamsters’ union officials, carefully staged by FBI agents, and
now, after this skirmishing, comes the full-dress legal onslaught.
 

Epstein on Arnold
In the N.Y. Times for November 26, there is a lengthy
communication which thoroughly exposes the reactionary nature of
Attorney General Arnold’s proposal. It carries especial weight
because it is signed not by a radical, not by a trade unionist, but
by the Solicitor General of the State of New York, Henry Epstein.
“One must read and reread Mr. Arnold’s
letter several times before its terrific impact on the development of
a bill of rights for American trade unions can be fully appreciated,”
writes Mr. Epstein. “Sugar coat it how you may, it remains a
throwback to the Danbury Hatter’s Duplex Printing cases.”
Here I might parenthetically interject that the editors of that
great liberal organ, The New Republic, didn’t get below
the sugar-coating. Believe it or not, in the issue of November 29,
they editorially approve Arnold’s letter, complacently
remarking: “We think sensible people will agree with Mr.
Arnold’s plan of attack.”
Solicitor General Epstein’s letter destroys completely the
legal alibi for Arnold’s plan. He points out that Congress in
1916 made a special point of including in the Clayton Act sections 6
and 20, expressly exempting unions from the operation of the
anti-trust laws. He also shows in detail how almost any trade union
activity could be legally attacked under Arnold’s
interpretation of the anti-trust laws.
“This warning of Mr. Arnold’s,” he
concludes, “gives evidence of some careful planning. Scarcely
hidden, however, is its actual threat to labor unions and their only
effective weapons. The danger lies in the fact that labor cannot know
when its acts will run into criminal prosecution, to say nothing of
civil damage suits.
“The warning is equally applicable to AFL and CIO.
Here is an issue on which they can unite, to combine forces and
prevent the nullification of labor’s gains through distortion
and misapplication of anti-trust laws. They have not long to wait.”
 

This Peculiar Boom
Since the Reichswehr crossed the Polish frontier on September 1,
American industrial production has increased 20 per cent, which is
very nearly the largest increase in such a short period ever
recorded. The steel industry, backbone of our industrial system, is
now operating at around 92 per cent of capacity. Between July and
November of this year, the number of blast furnaces in operation
increased from 40 per cent of the total in existence to 80 per cent –
a more rapid rise than took place even during the last war.
Steel’s prosperity has spread to all the other sectors of
our economic system. Third quarter earnings of the big corporations
are way above those for the same period of last year. Even the
railroads are making money these days. As for such industries as
airplane building (which now has almost $200,000,000 worth of new
contracts for planes on its books) and naval shipbuilding (where the
War Deal recently, without any publicity, gave up competitive bidding
and restored the old “cost-plus-10%” system which
produced such scandals in the last war) – these especially
favored sectors are coining money right and left.
But there is something phoney about this boom, just as there is
something phoney about this war. This is shown by the peculiar action
of the stock market in the last two months. In the opening weeks of
the war, there was a wild rise in stock prices. Then this hectic boom
slowed down, stopped, and for many weeks now the stock market has
been hanging in the doldrums – no great activity, prices
fluctuating back and forth without getting anywhere. The N.Y.
Times average of stock prices, which shot up to 114 in the
opening days of the war, has now declined to 110. A month or so ago,
when the corporations were reporting huge earnings for the quarter,
the Dow- Jones index of industrial stocks stood at 156. Its reaction
to these reports has been to decline slowly to a present level of
151.
This odd behavior of the stock market seems to have two main
causes. (1) Wall Street, which looks beneath the surface in such
matters, knows that there has not been enough of a rise in domestic
consumption to support the rise in production and earnings. (2)
Therefore, unless the war becomes “serious” and large
orders from the Allies flood the American market, the industrial boom
will collapse in the next few months. At present, this boom is as
phoney as the war – since it is based on the expectation of
huge war orders and not on any large amount of actual orders.
 

Will the War Solve Unemployment?
Recent propaganda from Washington has spread wide the impression
that the present war boom in industry is giving jobs at a rapid rate
to the nation’s jobless. In a few months, one gathers, the huge
total of the unemployed will have been whittled down to “reasonable”
proportions.
This is – propaganda. The fact is that already the 1929
level of production has been passed, and there are still at least ten
million unemployed workers. And even if the war boom reaches heights
which at present seem unlikely, even then there will be no important
decrease in the total of unemployed. Howard Hunter, a WPA official,
recently estimated that even if our exports to Europe increased by
$1,000,000,000 in the next year, which would mean a 100% increase,
this would employ only 600,000 more American workers – which is
about the net increase (after deaths, etc., have been allowed for) in
the country’s labor force every year. If exports to South
America were similarly increased, another 600,000 workers might find
jobs. Add in another million who would be employed because of the
internal expansion that would probably accompany such a rise in
foreign trade, and you still have reduced the unemployed only to
8,000,000. “We should have done with the will o’ the wisp
notion that a war boom is going to wipe out unemployment,”
Hunter concludes.
Politicians who talk about the tremendous effect a war boom would
have on unemployment are really thinking – the more
sophisticated among them, at least – in terms not of a neutral
America selling goods to the Allies, but of an America that is itself
in the war as a belligerent. When they speak of the labor shortage in
the last war, they are really talking about the period after we had
gone in, when we were feeding and equipping an army of four million
men and had extended unlimited credits to the Allies.
All this talk about a war boom solving the unemployment problem,
therefore, is no more and no less than propaganda to ease the working
class into the war.
 




Not Fit to Print
Those who read the midnight edition of the N.Y. Times for
Friday, December 8, found on page 5 a story headlined, “ANTI-WAR
SENTIMENT IN U.S. RISES, GALLUP SURVEY FINDS.” Readers of later
editions found this news story still listed in the index, but, on
turning to page 5, they discovered the story had been removed. Nor
was it to be found elsewhere in the issue. 

The Times is famous for its boast, “All the News
That’s Fit to Print.” The anti-war story apparently was
judged by the editors less fit to print than the following items, all
of which appeared in the later editions on page 5: (1) Princess
Hohenloe leaves England after losing her suit against Lord
Rothermere; (2) the first death of a woman in the Royal Air Force is
recorded; (3) a lengthy story headlined, “LONDON DOCKS HUM
DESPITE NAZI MINES.”
 

“To Make the World Safe for Kaiserism”
The last war was fought to get rid of the Kaiser. This war –
according to certain conservative statesmen now in the British
cabinet who are talking of setting up again the imperial throne of
the Hohenzollerns – is being fought to bring back the Kaiser.
“Plus ca change, plus c’est le meme chose,”
say the French, which means, “The more things change, the more
they remain the same.” Or, American style, “No matter how
you slice it, it’s always baloney.”
 

Perfidious Albion
The same British ruling class circles which now are fighting the
war to restore the Hohenzollerns, not so long ago were the loyal
allies of the Nazi regime. The Bank of England, for example, was for
years notoriously friendly to the Nazis, taking the lead in extending
to Hitler the vast credits he needed to complete his rearmament
program. Then Hitler marched into Czech Slovakia, and the British
ruling class suddenly “awoke” to the fact that his plans
for expansion would inevitably come into conflict with the British
Empire, and that the real threat to their class interests came from
Nazi Germany and not from Stalinist Russia. There followed the
momentous change of political orientation which culminated in the
outbreak of the war.
The rupture between the Nazis and the bankers of London, however,
is not as complete as you might think from listening to Winston
Churchill’s speeches. According to a recent issue of
Uncensored:
“Today, three months after the outbreak of war, the
Bank of England is accepting German paper as collateral for loans to
British banks. Since Britain still regards German credits as sound,
it is quite possible that she may sell German paper to neutrals –
for example, to Swiss bankers who have already made credit agreements
with the Germans – and thus help promote a lively trade with
Germany.”
It is an especially confusing twist, in this most perplexing of
all wars, that the great New York banks refuse to accept German notes
and securities as collateral for loans, and in fact have been trying
desperately to liquidate the $50,000,000 worth of German paper they
held at the outbreak of war. Thus the bankers of belligerent England
show more confidence in and friendship towards the Hitler regime than
do the bankers of “neutral” America.
 

Stalin’s Automata
Something I have thought a good deal about, especially in the last
few months, is the effect on individuals like Browder and Molotov and
other Stalinist mouthpieces of having to give expression continually
to lies – and lies, furthermore, which any child can see are in
contradiction to other lies they have uttered a few weeks earlier. It
is notable that Stalin is no orator, that he rarely breaks his
silence, at least not for publication. Shrewdly, he leaves to his
puppets the spirit-destroying task of formally justifying in public
the cynically opportunist twists of “the general line.”
The recent public utterances of Molotov and Browder would make one
ashamed of the human species – were it not clear that such
politicians by now can hardly be considered men. A century ago a
French nobleman named De Custine travelled widely in Czarist Russia
and wrote a perceptive book about it. His description of “the
human parts of the grand machine of state” applies also to
their successors of present-day Russia.
“Such parts,” writes De Custine, “acting
under an influence which is not in themselves, like the wheel-work of
a clock, are called men in Russia! The sight of these voluntary
automata inspires me with a kind of fear: there is something
supernatural in an individual reduced to the state of a mere machine.
If, in lands where the mechanical arts flourish, wood and metal seem
‘almost human’, under despotisms, human beings seem to
become as instruments of wood. We ask ourselves what can have become
of their superfluity of thought? And we feel ill at ease to think of
the pressure that must have been exerted on intellectual creatures
before they could have been reduced to mere things.”
 




Book Bargain
Without much question the book bargain of the year, of many years,
is a quarto, of 396 pages entitled: The Structure of the American
Economy, Part I, Basic Characteristics. It is put out by the
National Resources Committee, a government research agency, and was
prepared by a large staff of economists under the direction of
Gardner C. Means (who was co-author, with Adolf Berle, of The
Modern Corporation and Private Property). It is printed on coated
stock, with many charts, graphs and maps, covering everything from
interlocking directorates of the two hundred biggest corporations to
the amount of money spent by various income groups on food, clothing,
tobacco, books, etc. And it can be obtained by sending one dollar to
the Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D.C.
Marxists should find this book as absorbing reading as any
detective story. They will not expect Mr. Means and his staff to
reach any valid conclusions, and in this they will not be
disappointed. Mr. Means reaches no conclusions at all, in fact, which
is in this case perhaps a virtue. But he does present frankly and
honestly – within the limitations of the ruling class outlook –
the basic data on which any sort of effective political thinking,
Marxist or not, must be based.
 

Lost: Two Hundred Billion Dollars
In the next New International I plan to analyze and
summarize some of the wealth of data in this book. But there is one
point made here which is so dramatic an exposure of the insanity of
our capitalist system that it seems worth emphasizing here.
Everyone knows that during the last ten years there have been from
8,000,000 to 16,000,000,000 American workers for whom the system
could not provide jobs. Everyone, and especially the unemployed
themselves, know to what wretched, subhuman depths of poverty these
millions have been reduced. But it will come as a shock to most
people to learn that if the available manpower and machines in the
country had been employed fully in the eight years, 1930–1937,
our society would have produced two hundred billion dollars more
goods and services than it actually did.
Two hundred billion dollars is so huge a sum that it might as well
be two dollars. When figures reach a certain magnitude, they cease to
make any impression on the mind at all. They become abstract
concepts, like the number of trillion light years it would take to
reach some distant constellation. This volume however, makes it clear
what this figure means:
“The significance of this figure of two hundred
billions is hard to grasp, but some idea can be obtained by
considering what two hundred billion dollars would mean in terms of
concrete goods. If all the idle men and machines could have been
employed in making houses, the extra income would have been enough to
provide a new $6,000 house for every family in the country. If,
instead, the lost income had been used to build railroads, the entire
system of the country could have been scrapped and rebuilt at least
five times over ... Failure to use available resources meant a lower
standard of living for practically every group in the community.”
Later on, Means puts it in another why: “If the whole waste
of the depression due to idle men and idle machines could have been
used to build agricultural and industrial plant, the existing plant
could have been completely rebuilt.” That is, if we had had an
economic system not in contradiction to our productive forces, if
socialism had replaced capitalism in 1929, then every steel plant in
the country, every cotton mill and packing house and shoe factory and
every other industrial plant from Ford’s River Rouge plant to
the smallest one-room machine, shop, every mile of railroad track,
every locomotive, every barn and silo and grain elevator – all
of this and a thousand other such categories of productive plants
could have been duplicated if the unemployed had been fully employed
in those eight years. Today we would be able to produce just twice as
many goods and services as we actually are able to produce.
 

Still More
Nor is this all. Even when our cockeyed capitalist system is
functioning at its very top form, even in the boom year of 1929, it
was unable to make anything like full use of our productive
resources.
“The Brookings Institution,” writes Means,
“has estimated that in the peak year 1929 both production and
national income could have been increased 19 percent by merely
putting to work the men and machines that were idle in that year,
even without the introduction of improved techniques of production.”
Nor is this all. Means’s figure of two hundred billion
dollars only goes through 1937. But in the fall of 1937 there
occurred the sharpest economic decline in the history of American
capitalism. In half a year, unemployment rose by 3,000,000 to a total
of 13,000,000; in a year, the farm price index dropped from 128 to
92, the index of industrial production fell from 118 to 76. Only now,
under the artificial stimulus of a war boom, is our economy painfully
climbing out of the wreckage of 1937.
Means has no estimate of the losses from unemployment in the last
two years, 1938–1939. Considering the severity of the 1937–38
slump, it seems conservative to put the loss in the last two years at
the same rate as in the preceding eight years. This would mean adding
another fifty billion dollars, which would be enough to replace every
residential building in the country, from Park Avenue apartments to
sharecroppers’ shacks.
 




Understatement Dept.
“Experiments in how best to entertain soldiers back
of the Maginot Line have shown that movie shows come first, cards
second and games like dominoes third in popularity ... Few men show
any disposition to read books, possibly because there is always too
much interruption.” – news report in a recent N.Y.
Times.
 

Death, Inc.
In previous columns, I have noted how the former sharp distinction
between war and peace has become blurred in our age, until by now war
has been absorbed into the normal, everyday routine of life under
capitalism.
This seems to hold true of both the bourgeoisie and the workers in
this war. As to the former, the British Government announced a few
weeks after the outbreak of the war that it would pay compensation
for all damages to civilian life, limb and property “due to
action by or against the King’s enemies”. In announcing
this policy, Sir John Simon, Chancellor of the Exchequer, explained:
“The risk is one which affects us all and a particular person
or a particular property which is struck is a casual victim of the
general peril which the State is engaged in doing its best to
resist.” Thus war is officially recognized as one of the normal
hazards of doing business under capitalism, and the shopkeeper whose
windows are shattered by German bombs can collect from the State for
them just as if the damage had been done by His Majesty’s
police officers in the discharge of their duty.
The British business man can also insure himself – with
private firms – against the hazards of peace. “Armistice
insurance” is now one of the regular forms of insurance in
London. For a premium of ten pounds on every hundred pounds worth of
business, a business man can fully insure himself against all losses
which might result if the war ends in the next two months. For every
additional month after that, he must pay ten pounds more.
For the workers as well, this war has taken on something of the
character of normal peacetime activity. In the last war, workers
began functioning as soldiers only when they put on their uniforms.
This time in uniform they still retain the character of workers
engaged in some vast industrial undertaking. Thus one recent news
item from the Maginot Line read: “So great are the distances
that the troops actually ride to work on bicycles. We passed details
of them pedalling up from their living quarters to gun positions ...”
The phrase, “ride to work,” is significant.
Another report describes the new field uniform of the British
Army:
“The Highlanders whom General Gort visited were in their
picturesque uniforms ... The day was one of the last occasions on
which these and other Scottish troops will appear in the field in
their traditional uniforms. The change is being rapidly made from the
peacetime uniform to ‘battle dress’ – a most
unromantic but eminently practical costume for combat, consisting of
a one-piece khaki overall with a zipper fastener down the front and
snaps at the trouser bottoms to keep out the mud.”
Kilts and tartans give way to zippered khaki overalls. The soldier
has become a mass production worker who wears overalls and rides to
work on his bicycle. If the war drags on this way much longer, whole
industrial towns may spring up behind the lines, inhabited by
families of soldiers. The infantry “worker” will kiss his
wife goodbye in the morning and tramp, or cycle, off to “work”,
a rifle on one shoulder and a well-filled lunch box and thermos of
hot coffee under the arm. The thoroughly tamed trade union
bureaucracies in France and England will then raise some inspiring
new slogans: TIME AND A HALF FOR OVERTIME IN THE TRENCHES! NO
OFFENSIVES ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS AND SUNDAYS!
 

Anthology of War Poetry, No. 1
Bernarr MacFadden, publisher of pulp magaazines, last year offered
a $1,000 prize for an official song for the U.S. Army Air Corps –
hitherto songless. I reproduce below the first verse of the winning
ditty, officially approved by Major General Henry H. Arnold, chief of
the Army Air Corps:



Off we go into the wild blue yonder,
Climbing high into the sun;
Here they come zooming to meet our thunder,
At ’em boys, Give ’er the gun!
Down we dive spouting our flame from under
Off with one helluva* roar!
We live, in fame
Or go down in flame
BOY! Nothing’ll stop the Army Air Corps!



* NOTE (by publisher of song): For radio, substitute “ter-ri-ble”.
 



THE NATION SLIPS EVER more swiftly into the worn old grooves of the War To Make the World Safe for Democracy. Thomas Mann continues to extol bourgeois democracy, at good fees, before large and enthusiastic audiences. The Transcontinental & Western Air Line changes its subtitle from “The Lindbergh Line” to “The Sunny Santa Fe Trail.” Random House advertizes its new Pageant of the States: “Will inculcate a great love of country. An ideal gift book, particularly for youngsters.” Even Hollywood has dared at last, in spite of the Hays office and the Catholic censorship, to exploit the rising tide of antifascist sentiment. Walter Wanger, who produced Blockade, has joined Senator Capper, Frederick March, Dorothy Canfield Fisher, Henry Pratt Fairchild, Marc Connelly, and, of course, Thomas Mann in founding “Films for Democracy,” while the Warner Brothers have announced no less than four anti-Nazi films for this Spring. The tragic thing is that this universal detestation of fascism is, in itself, a credit to human nature. It is only when linked up, as it must be under capitalism, with the armed defense of the bourgeois status quo, that it turns sour. The next world slaughter, like the last, will be staged for the highest ethical reasons.

Blow, Bugle, Blow! The strongest note in the chauvinist symphony was sounded by the President. The Nation – which one remembers, with difficulty, as having been once a respectable liberal weekly – ran a lead editorial:
“The President’s opening message to Congress rang out like a bugle across the world to rally the dispirited and retreating democracies to a stand. Both its manner and its matter place it among the great state papers of our history. Glowingly eloquent, it was a long way from mere rhetoric. Its essential appeal was to the intelligence, and as such [sic!] it formed a striking contrast to the frenzied demagogy of the dictators ... To suggest that the President, in urging definite American resistance to aggression, was whipping up a jingo spirit is grossly unjust.”
I don’t want to be grossly unjust, especially to any one with as many headaches as F.D.R. has at the moment, but I admit I detected a certain martial strain in his bugle call.
But for all their enthusiasm, the editors of the Nation prudently kept their fingers crossed. As is their custom these confusing days, they took back in the fourth paragraph most of what they had stated in the first. Calling on the President to raise the embargo on shipments of munitions to Spain, they wrote:
“Hesitation will reduce a magnificent speech to mere wind. We look to him to act and act now.”
Since a good two weeks have gone by since this was written, and the President has shown no signs of acting, I take it that his “great state paper” has now been automatically reduced to “mere wind”. But what is one to think of political commentators who have to wait two weeks to find out the most elementary Facts of Life?
The Nation adjures the President in pathetic tones to raise the embargo. The New Leader headlines, “TORIES KEEP FOOD, GUNS FROM LOYALISTS”. But who applied the Neutrality Act to Spain in the first place? Who clapped on this embargo on arms for the struggling Spanish people? Who but that Paladin of Liberty, that plumed knight of Democracy, Franklin D. Roosevelt! When he found that, under the Neutrality Act, he could not prevent the shipment of munitions to Loyalist Spain, the President forced through Congress a special resolution forbidding such shipments. Now that it looks as though Franco is winning, now that the republic has its back to the wall, and above all now that fascism has suddenly been discovered to be The Enemy, every one from Secretary Ickes to “Wrong Horse Harry” Stimson, Hoover’s Secretary of State, wants to raise the embargo. Unquestionably, the President would like to do so. But I think it doubtful that he will, since he is neither a paladin nor a plumed knight, except in the fevered imagination of Nation editors, but rather an extremely skillful bourgeois politician who knows that the Catholic vote is formidable – and that, within twenty-four hours after a recent pronouncement by the Catholic hierarchy, more than 100,000 telegrams were delivered to Congessmen demanding the embargo be retained.

“Janus” sends in his monthly quota of smart remarks: There is no room in Russia for the German refugees, we hear, because the jails are full already ... “NO COSTER CASE POSSIBLE IN SOVIET UNION” headlined the Daily Worker.
After all, the Russian Coster is installed in the Kremlin ... Although it now accepts a wide variety of advertisements in its drive towards democracy and war, the Daily Worker draws the line at patent medicine ads. It is satisfied with corruption of the mind ... Chiang Kai-shek was a great disappointment to Stalin. Brüning was a great disappointment to Stalin. Schuschnigg was a great disappointment to Stalin. Chamberlain was a great disappointment to Stalin. Daladier was a great disappointment to Stalin. Roosevelt ...?

Clare Sheridan was a good-looking young Englishwoman, a cousin of Winston Churchill, who went to Russia in 1920 to make portrait heads of the great ones of the revolution: Lenin, Trotsky, Dzerzhinsky, Krassin, Kamenev, Zinoviev. (She doesn’t seem to have heard of Stalin.) When she returned to England, she wrote a little book about her experiences which, despite a certain gushiness, still makes good reading. Her account of Kamenev, under whose aegis she made the trip, is particularly interesting – and, in 1938, moving. She tells of a big labor meeting in Trafalgar Square they attended together:
“Some one recognized Kamenev, and the whisper went round and spread like wildfire. The men on either side of him asked if they might announce he was there, to which he answered a most emphatic ‘No.’ When Lansbury had finished speaking, there was an appeal for money for the ‘Cause.’ It was interesting to watch the steady rain of coins, and very touching to see how the poor gave their pennies. Lansbury buried his face in his hat to shield himself from the metallic rain. After that we went away, and a gangway was made for us, and all along the whisper went of ‘Kamenev,’ and the faces that looked at us were radiant as though they beheld a savior.”
Later on, she describes her parting, in Moscow, from Kamenev:
“He would not listen to any words of appreciation. He smiled in his genial, kindly way: ‘Of course we were glad to receive you, une femme artiste – what did it matter to us, your nationality, or your relations. There is only one thing que nous ne pouvons pas supporter’ – and for the first time in all the months I have known him a hard look passed over his face and he set his teeth: ‘The only thing we cannot stand, c’est l’espionage,’ and the way he said it gave me a shiver down my spine.”

Any one who has ever followed trade papers knows that business men talk quite differently among themselves than for public consumption. Such publications call spades by their right name, since their readers want information, not propaganda. Thus in a recent issue of one of those “confidential” news-letters that are sent out from Washington to a business clientele, there is a story about the New Deal’s latest plans for increasing consumption. “Idea is to find ways of enabling more people to eat more food,” the letter begins, and continues bluntly:
“It appears to be a fact that 1/3 of our people, perhaps even ½, don’t get enough to eat ... So – step up consumption, eat up surpluses, thus aid farmers. That’s the basic idea. How? One way might be by socialism or communism.”
Thus casually, between themselves, do business men concede that communism would give people more to eat.

To round out John Masefield’s quatrain on Chamberlain, printed in this department recently, Earle Birney of The Canadian Forum sends this stanza of his own composition:



And as Achilles dragged old Priam’s son
Three times round Troy, and then returned the dead
So Adolf tossed you from the war now sped
The gritty corpse of peace not yet begun.

The Coster Case (continued). At least two movies are being rushed to completion on the Coster case, and no doubt the full story will soon appear in book form. Meanwhile, there are several interesting items that may have escaped your attention ... To break a CIO strike of warehousemen, the late Coster-Musica signed one of William Green’s famous “fink contracts,” which had the usual sections setting minimum hours and maximum pay (instead of vice versa, as one might expect in a union contract), and pledging the AF of L to function as strikebreaker in case of any “trouble” with the CIO ... When one of the Musica sisters married a gardner, her brothers were annoyed because she had “married into the working class” – which didn’t prevent them, later on, from borrowing $1,000 from her ... It turns out that Coster’s biography in Who’s Who was almost 100% fictitious, including two mythical college degrees and an impressive roster of clubs to which he did not belong. The editors of Who’s Who have stated that it is their policy to offer “without question” a listing to such pillars of bourgeois society as “heads of the established institutions of learning ... bishops and chief ecclesiastics ... presidents of the larger businesses.” They feel that, among their 77,000 listings, “the Coster-Musica fraud has every indication of being unique”. Just what these “indications” are, they don’t specify ... The wits of Wall Street have had a field day with the scandal. It has been suggested that Coster might be termed a “hypothecary”, and that he committed suicide because “he couldn’t face the Musica”. And a rhyme is being circulated:



Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard
To get her poor dog a bone;
When she got there, the cupboard was bare
– And what a surprise that was to Price, Waterhouse & Co.

Rosa Luxemburg wrote her celebrated Junius Pamphlet from a German prison cell during the last war, but most of it is tragically applicable to the situation today. One passage out of many is worth recalling:
Our party press was filled with moral indignation over the fact that Germany’s foes should drive black men and barbarians, Negroes, Sikhs, and Maoris into the war. Yet these peoples play a role in this war that is approximately identical with that played by the socialist proletariat in the European states. If the Maoris of New Zealand were eager to risk their skulls for the English king, they showed as much understanding of their own interests as the German social-democratic group that traded the existence, the freedom and the civilization of the German people for the existence of the Hapsburg monarchy, for Turkey and for the vaults of the Deutsche Bank.
One difference there is between the two. A generation ago, Maori Negroes were still cannibals and not students of Marxian philosophy.
When one reads a passage like that, one understands why the Kremlin has recently let loose a campaign of slander and calumny against the memory of Luxemburg.

There have been some objections to my note on the Steel Workers Organizing Committee last month, especially to the sentence:
“And even if Little Steel signs up with the SWOC, it will mean only that its workers will be organized under one capitalist flag rather than another.”
I must admit this formulation is rather too sharp. However distorted and crippled by bureaucratic control, the SWOC is nonetheless a genuine union, and hence responsive to the pressure and the needs of the workers as the company unions of Little Steel by their very nature cannot be. And the more workers flock into the SWOC, the greater will be the rank-and-file pressure for a more democratic type of organization.

Note on Reformism: The Securities Act of 1933 forbade banks which accepted deposits to engage in the underwriting of securities. A great victory for the forces of righteousness! The wickedest monster of them all, J.P. Morgan & Co., was actually forced to give up its vast underwriting business! And so one of the third generation Morgans went off and founded the house of Morgan, Stanley & Co., which was completely independent of 23 Wall Street except that Morgan money financed it and Morgan customers somehow found their way thither. Latest news on the progress of this great reform move is supplied by a recent SEC release on securities issued between January 1 and September 30, 1938. Morgan, Stanley is far in the lead, with $365,100,000 worth of securities. Halsey, Stuart & Co., was a poor second with $144,300,000 and Bonbright an even worse third with $78,000,000.

Cat-out-of-Bag-Department: “To obtain full cooperation in such a broad and coordinated national defense program, improved relations between Government and business are necessary and will doubtless be sought by the Administration.” (From a market letter recently issued by Delafield & Delafield, of 14 Wall Street.)
 





On the Other Side of the Railroad Tracks
The 1938 edition of the Periodicals Directory is a volume of 465 close-printed pages which lists and describes 10,200 publications, most of them trade papers. There is a section headed “Grocery Trades,” with 29 publications listed, another headed “Vending Machines,” with 4, and so on. But there is no section headed either “Munitions” or “Armaments” or “War Supplies,” and the only trace of the subject in the lengthy index is: “Rifles – See GAMES AND SPORTS: Hunting; Shooting.”
The munitions industry apparently boasts not a single trade paper. As the respectable citizens of a community don’t talk about the red light district across the railroad tracks, so the business fraternity observes a taboo of silence on that great industry which has become the very heart of modern capitalism: Death, Inc. The furriers have trade journals, and so have those who make paper cups and harmonicas and perfumes and ice cream, but the merchants of death, whose vast enterprises are keeping the great capitalist economies of the world going along even as limpingly as they are today, these gentlemen do not discuss their trade in public. Their business lies across the railroad tracks.
 

Fig out of Thistle
According to the Good Book, thistle trees don’t produce figs. But I challenge any reader of this column to guess what periodical printed the following editorial comment on Roosevelt’s recent “War Message” to Congress:
“We must make up our minds, said the President, to save our religious and democratic institutions, for ‘we know what might happen to us of the United States if the new philosophies of forces were to encompass the other continents and invade our own.’ Although the aggressor States were not named, it was sufficiently obvious that Mr. Roosevelt had in mind Germany, Italy, and Japan. He failed to indicate, however, that whatever these countries formerly could boast of freedom and tolerance was destroyed from within, and not from without. Nor was any reference made to the complete improbability of an attack by any or all of those aggressor governments upon the United States, or to the even more remote contingency of success in any foreign attack so long as the liberties left us by our own government are worth fighting for and preserving.”
This voice of sanity in a mad world was raised by The Commercial & Financial Chronicle. The moral scarcely needs underlining: (1) businessmen talk among themselves realistically and not in the tones they use for wide public consumption; (2) unlike the liberal intelligentsia, finance capital has a serious stake in capitalism and so thinks twice before risking its vast properties in the maelstrom of a world war. Which doesn’t prevent it, of course, when the moment has arrived at which it judges war is “necessary.” from swinging its heavy battalions decisively into line between the liberal and reformist skirmishers. But if the Chronicle is to be taken as an index of Wall Street opinion, that moment has not yet arrived. In this, at least, the editors of the Nation are in advance of their age.
 

Afterthoughts on Monday Night
After the splendid demonstration put on by the Socialist Workers Party last Monday, it may seem ungrateful to offer criticism. But precisely because the affair was a success, because the SWP showed, in militant action, its superiority over the other parties of the Left, I think certain serious shortcomings should be pointed out. I must begin by stating that from eight o’clock on, I was inside the Garden – I hope it’s not necessary to add I was there on business, not pleasure. But I have checked my criticisms with those who saw the whole business, and I think they are justified.
Generally speaking, I should say the SWP did not plan the affair carefully enough, did not use showmanship in putting over its message, and failed utterly to exploit the demonstration as a means of advertising to the general public the SWP and its press. By the time I arrived on the scene – about 7:00 – there was not a banner or a placard to be seen except for one small cardboard sign a girl was holding aloft in her hands, without benefit of a stick. I was told the police had seized and destroyed all such signs at the beginning of the demonstration. But this should have been foreseen, and reserve supplies should have been provided, smuggled in under coats or cached in some place outside the battle zone. Without signs or banners, the public saw merely what I saw: a confused, anonymous mass of demonstrators. Far more serious was the failure to distribute SWP literature. I saw not a single copy of the Appeal, or the New International offered for sale, and I am told there was no effort made at any time to sell literature. I was told, indeed, that during the speeches by Max Shachtman, James Burnham and others, there was at least one enterprising vendor circulating among the crowd offering for sale – the Daily Worker! Among the tens of thousands of outsiders who in the course of the evening either took part in the demonstration or watched it sympathetically, there must have been thousands who would have paid three cents for an Appeal. For that matter, my own pamphlet, Fascism and the American Scene, should have sold well in such a crowd. But no one – including myself – thought of exploiting the occasion.
Small matters, these? It was just their superiority in details like banners and showmanship that gave the Nazis a great advantage over their left-wing opponents. (Hitler is said to design his party’s insignia and flags himself.) Today, when the Enemy has reduced mass propaganda to an exact science, a revolutionary party must pay attention to the details as well as the broad outlines, to the technique as well as ‘to the content of its appeal to the masses.
 




The trouble with lying is that, as Gainsborough remarked of Mrs. Siddon’s nose, there’s no end to it. What begins as a simple, unassuming frame-up is likely to end up by requiring a wholesale revision of history and art. Having successfully used the Moscow trials to destroy all potential leaders of an opposition, the Kremlin now finds itself committed to the extraordinary thesis that all the great leaders of 1917, except Lenin and Stalin, were even then traitors and spies. This campaign of falsification, probably the most ambitious in all history, has corrupted every sphere of Soviet life. The cinema, above all has been pressed into service to document the trials in celluloid. A year ago the first of such films, Lenin in October, arrived over here. And now two more are being shown in the little cinemas: Ermler’s The Great Citizen and Tutkevitch’s The Man With the Gun. These are two of the leading directors in the so-called “Stalin School” which has come to dominate the Soviet cinema in recent years. In 1932 they worked together on Counterplan, a monumentally dull and now forgotten film which was the first major effort to introduce “Socialist Realism” into the cinema. There is no point in analyzing their films from a cinematic point of view: there is nothing in either of them that will get their creators into trouble with the authorities, which is to say they are the tamest, flattest, most banal sort of Hollywood realism. But they are more interesting from a political standpoint.
 

Down with Tractors!
Ermler’s film shows us the struggle of “The Great Citizen” – evidently intended to be Kirov – against a sinister clique of saboteurs, evidently meant to represent the Bukharinist right-wing opposition to the first Five Year Plan. The plots and counterplots revolve around what would seem to be a simple enough question: whether it was desirable that the level of production should be raised. The Great Citizen takes a firm stand for industrialization, and also comes out strongly in favor of more tractors. The Bukharinists, motivated by that paranoiacal malignancy which seems to afflict the opponents of Stalin, try to persuade the workers that tractors are evil and industrialization a curse. It is never made clear why they take this position, nor, for that matter, why they are willing to gamble, and as it chances to lose, their high governmental posts in this campaign for a lower productive level. It seems to be a matter of art for art’s sake.
Everything comes to a head in a mass meeting, at which the Bukharinists are sandbagged with everything from mother love to the theory of socialism in one country, and are finally driven from the platform in deep and well-merited disgrace. After that, there is only one course left. The film ends with their first meeting with the emissary of an unnamed foreign power. As they plot, loud bursts of band music come in the windows from a passing demonstration of workers (who are celebrating the birth of a tractor), drowning out their talk. This is supposed to symbolize the ultimate triumph of the healthy masses. But I could not but remember that this music, the cheapest sort of Sousa brass band stuff, was advertised as by Dimitri Shostakovitch, the once-brilliant young composer who was admonished by Stalin several years ago to “write tunes the workers can whistle.” And the offstage music seemed to be a symbol, in its noisy triviality, of something else again.
 

Those Men Are Here Again
In Yutkevitch’s The Man With the Gun we see once more those twin demigods, Lenin and Stalin, pulling off the 1917 revolution practically single-handed. Their first appearance was in Lenin in October. Here once more, they steer the revolution to safe harbor in the teeth of treacherous opposition from their closest collaborators. “Never mind Zinoviev and Kamenev,” Lenin tells Stalin on the phone. “They are fleas which will always irritate us.” (He fails to explain why he didn’t crush these “fleas” then and there.) He takes Trotsky more seriously, however. “Keep a close watch on Trotsky!” he counsels Stalin. But later on it appears that Trotsky has escaped from his keepers long enough to see to it that the wrong calibre shells are sent to a crucial sector of the battle front. When the news is brought to Lenin, he makes it clear that he suspects the fine Italian hand of the commander-in-chief of his army. Stalin bustles off to repair the damage at once.
By now such films have worked out a formula for portraying Lenin. On the one hand, he is shown as a simple, homey sort of old fellow – in the memorable phrase of Robert Forsythe in the New Masses: “a man who might easily have played third base for the Brooklyn Dodgers.” He is constantly slapping people (usually Stalin) on the back, sharing their joys and sorrows, munching apples or cold boiled potatoes in democratic fashion, and otherwise demonstrating that he’s a regular fellow. But this unprepossessing old gentleman has the most extraordinary effect on all who come into contact with him. Their awe and reverence approaches the mystical; their faith in him is the complete, touching faith of little children. When the simple soldier who is the hero of The Man With the Gun learns that he has been talking, quite unsuspecting, to Lenin, he rushes back to his comrades, assembles them around him and stammers out, “I have just talked to ... LENIN!” Quick fadeout on his crazed, ecstatic face. Later on, he persuades a whole company of enemy soldiers to join the Reds simply by telling them he has talked to Lenin and that Lenin is O.K. and has their interests at heart. Thus on the one hand, Lenin is made human, all too human – to the point of vulgarization; and on the other, he is elevated to a living ikon, a leader whose mere presence, whose very name indeed, has magical powers. Both sides of the contradiction serve well the interests of the Kremlin today.
 

Uncomfortable Posts
I don’t envy the actors who have to play “Lenin” and “Stalin” in these tableaux. In this film, both parts are taken by different performers from those who played in Lenin in October. This Lenin is Comrade Shtraukh (Honored Artist of the Republic), and he has evidently taken to heart Krupskaya’s criticism of his predecessor’s ever-expansive gesturing. He seems none too easy in his part. Nor does Comrade Gelovani, who plays Stalin, seem to be having a good time. These are posts uncomfortably close to the lightning. What has happened to Comrade Gelovani’s predecessor I do not know, but the Times recently reported that Comrade Schushkin, who played “Lenin” in the earlier film, has been placed under arrest. Perhaps he took a Leninist line off as well as on the stage.
 




Twenty years ago, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were murdered by reactionary army officers acting in collusion with the Social Democratic government of Berlin. As we draw steadily nearer to another world war, as reformism once more prepares a blood bath for the masses, the tragedy of Luxemburg takes on contemporary overtones. I can think of no better beginning for this column of comment on the events of 1939 than to reprint a “newsreel” I compiled last year on the death of Luxemburg in 1919:
 

From the New York Times, Jan. 18, 1919
Berlin, Jan. 16 (Associated Press) – Dr. Karl Liebknecht was killed by soldiers yesterday while he was trying to escape from custody.
Rosa Luxemburg was beaten into insensibility by a mob and afterward was shot to death ...
Virtually the entire Berlin press regards the fate of Dr. Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg as having “something of divine justice in it,” as the Tageszeitung phrases it ... The press in general deplores the lynching of Rosa Luxemburg, but declares that she fell a victim of the basest passions which she herself had awakened ...
The whole city is now swarming with soldiers, wearing steel helmets, carrying loaded rifles, and with hand grenades hanging on their belts. ... Karl Kautsky, former Under Secretary in the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Ebert Government ... was arrested yesterday morning. He was liberated later.
 

From the New York Times, Jan. 19, 1919
Berlin, Jan. 16 (via Copenhagen) – Dr. Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were arrested last night and while being transported to the Moabit Prison were thrashed by infuriated people and shot like mad dogs, the latter by an unknown man whose pistol may have saved her from a worse fate ... Their end, however cruel, will certainly do much for the restoration of peace and order ... Military Governor Noske is conducting a sharp investigation for the Social-Democratic government, but it seems that the soldiers’ conduct was faultless in both cases.
 

From the N.Y. World, Jan. 18, 1919
Berlin, Jan. 17 – I went to Gustav Noske, military governor of Berlin, and asked him how it was possible, with 40,000 troops in the city, that a crowd could get a prisoner away from the soldiers and kill her. Herr Noske replied: “Only a few soldiers were with each automobile, as such an attack was unexpected; the crowd, roused to intense anger by weeks of agitation by both the victims, were too much for the soldiers to handle.” “Unfortunately,” I said, “the incident is going to make a bad impression abroad ...” “It is regrettable,” Herr Noske replied, “but they are dead and we can now only make an inquiry.” ... “Do you expect it will lead to agitation again here?” “If it does,” Gov. Noske replied, “we must put it down.”
 

From the New York Times, Jan. 25, 1919
Amsterdam, Jan. 24. The body of Rosa Luxemburg, the Spartacist leader who was killed by a mob recently, was found yesterday in the Landwehr Canal, according to a report from Berlin. The body was terribly mutilated. The news is being kept secret for fear of anarchistic reprisals.
 

From the London Times, May 22, 1919
Berlin, May 21 – The leading facts leaked out gradually, and there was little inclination among those in power to make a fuss over the end of a pair of rebels. But these rebels were the idols of the people, and their passionate sincerity had commended them to many prominent radicals whose support the Government required. And so after months of waiting, the Government decided that some sort of trial was necessary.
Herr Scheidemann remembered that the accused were soldiers and that the Peace had not been signed. The form of trial he selected was a court-martial, the court being appointed by the Garde-Schutzen Division to which the accused men belonged ... The adherents of the victims refused to take any part in the proceedings.
The accused were not brought to the dock in the usual way, but were introduced from the Judge’s rooms. They arrived laughing and radiant, their breasts decorated with orders. Throughout the trial, they conducted themselves nonchalantly, one of them reading a newspaper when he felt bored, another eating sandwiches, a third playfully trying to get hold of some hand-bombs which one of his chums in uniform happened to have in his pocket ...
On the evening of the murders, soon after sunset, Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were taken to the Eden Hotel, where they spent some hours in charge of their guardians. There was ... a good deal of conversation, some of it animated, in which the two victims discussed and defended their views. Orders were received that they were to be transferred to the Moabit Prison, and Liebknecht was taken to the back door of the hotel, where a military car was waiting. As they were leaving, one of the company cried out: “See that these swine do not reach the prison alive!”
As soon as Liebknecht got into the car, Private Runge aimed two blows at him with the butt of his rifle. One blow missed, the other cut his head open. Ober-Lieutenant von Pflugk-Hartung, the officer in charge, then got into the car. (He told the Court that he had taken quite a fancy to Liebknecht in the hotel, thought that for a Socialist he had interesting views and a good way of putting them.) He drew his revolver and told him that he would shoot him if he tried to escape ... Presently, in a dark corner of the Thiergarten, the car stopped ... Liebknecht was shot and killed, and evidence was accepted as satisfactory that he must have been running away. Pflugk-Hartung was acquitted, with great applause ...
About an hour later, Rosa Luxemburg was taken to the front door of the hotel ... There, for some reason that was not inquired into, Private Runge was also waiting for her. As soon as she got into the car, he swung his rifle and clubbed her on the head. It was doubtful if his blows had actually proved fatal, and it was suggested that he was mentally defective. And so he was given two years’ imprisonment.
Lieutenant Vogel, the officer in charge of this party, then got into the car, accompanied by two other officers. “Fraulein Luxemburg,” he testified, “received two violent blows on the head from the butts of rifles of helmeted soldiers. She collapsed, and when we came to a bridge the thought came to us all to throw her body into the river.” According to the other officers, however, she was shot through the head by Lieutenant Vogel. He testified that he threw the body into the river “to save the honor of the Garde-Schutzen Division.” ... He was given a sentence of two years and four months imprisonment. Already, however, his escape had been contrived. A man in officer’s uniform drove up in a motor car to the prison, presented a forged warrant and released the prisoner.
The Freiheit, the organ of the Independent Socialists, is alone in denouncing the proceedings. The other newspapers think that in a case of this kind, “where political feelings are involved,” perhaps the whole story has not been sifted, but they are satisfied that substantial justice has been done.
 

From a statement, signed “Hussar Otto Runge,” printed in Freiheit, Jan. 9, 1921
On January 15, 1919, between seven and nine o’clock in the evening, I was stationed as sentry before the chief entrance of the Eden Hotel. Cavalryman Drager was with me. About nine o’clock there was a great to-do and excitement: it was rumored that Liebknecht and Luxemburg had been brought in. Several orders were at once given me by officers and sergeants, and the remark was dropped that these creatures must not be allowed to leave the hotel alive.
Concerning Liebknecht, I received strict orders from officers to knock the fellow down with the butt of my rifle ... As for Frau Luxemburg, officers came to me and said: “I order you to see that Luxemburg does not leave the hotel alive. Mind you swallow that!” Lieutenant von Pflugk-Hartung made a note of my name and said to me: “First Lieutenant Vogel will send her straight to you; all you’ll have to do is to strike hard.” When Frau Luxemburg was being dragged into the motor, somebody jumped up behind just as it was driving off and sent a bullet into her head. I could see that very clearly, as I was only a short distance away. He then jumped down and re-entered the Eden Hotel from the Nurnberger Strasse ... Meanwhile the others had returned and were boasting: “We’ve done for Liebknecht nicely. A trick was played on him. We got him to try to escape.” ... Of Luxemburg it was said: “The old sow is already afloat.”
 

Editorial from the New York Times, Jan. 18, 1919
Lynch Law in Berlin
Regrettable as is the manner of death, the work of private violence, not the law, that came to Dr. Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, it was to be expected, and does a summary, if irregular, justice to the fomenters of robbery, murder and anarchy ... These two leaders, the man violent but weak, the woman a termagant of the familiar revolutionary type, have perished miserably by the sword they drew. The defeat of the imitation Bolsheviks, the victory everywhere where elections have been held of the parties of order – Conservatives, Centrists, Democrats, Majority Social Democrats – are of the best omen for a representative moderate National Assembly, for a responsible and stable government. The Allies and the United States have hardly less interest than Germany itself in such an outcome.
 



Descent into the Maelstrom
For months now the vessel of world capitalism has been in the situation of that ship described by Edgar Allen Poe which was sucked down, slowly and inexorably, into the maelstrom.
“The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth ... Round and round we swept—not with any uniform movement—but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yards, sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl. Our progress downward at each revolution was slow but very perceptible ... The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound gulf, but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped ... This mist or spray was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel as they all met together at the bottom, but the yell that went up to Heaven from out of that mist I dare not attempt to describe.”
As Poe’s sailor lay on the slanting deck of his ship and looked down with horror into the chaos he was gradually nearing, so the peoples of Europe and America watch their social system slide downward to war. The sailor escaped death by a simple strategem, but no tricks will save us. No one doubts that if war doesn’t come this month, it will come next month, and if not next month, next year. There have been war crises before in this country, but they have always been resolved one way or the other within a relatively short time. The present crisis, however, has been going on for an unheard-of period, and by now the tension has become almost unbearable. Day after day the thing drags on, generating ever-increasing pressures which are deforming all social and political forms. As the pressure slowly mounts, people are coming to accept war as not only inevitable but as the normal social function of the state, as the understood end towards which all social activity is directed. In “normal” periods of capitalism, war is popularly regarded as a regrettable accident which interrupts the march of progress. Today, war has become the supreme reality and meaning of the whole system: the only questions asked are, “When?” and “Where?” And as the crisis drags itself out, our responses to each day’s scare headlines become exhausted, our sensibilities become blunted. We understand Macbeth’s speech at the end of the play:



“The time has been, my senses would have cool’d
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
 Would at a dismal treatise rouse, and stir,
As life were in’t. I have supp’d full with horrors:
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
Cannot once start me.”
 



The President’s Private World
A striking example of the effect of the interminable war crisis is the political deterioration of the New Deal. It is not simply a matter of the President abandoning his reformist program and seeking peace with business: that turn was inevitable. It is a matter of the New Deal program, never too firmly anchored to realities, floating entirely free from the actual world into a cloud cuckoo land of its own. Until recently I was inclined to dismiss as Republican canards those stories about the President bursting into peals of maniacal laughter in the midst of a startled and shocked press conference. Nor do I, speaking seriously, swallow them today. But there is certainly something peculiar about the tone of recent White House utterances. While not actually bereft of his senses, the President does appear to be more and more living in his own private world.
On the front page of today’s Times, for example, are three separate news stories, two of them with three-column heads. In each of them, the President is the principal actor. The first states that the Times’ Washington correspondent has just discovered that some months ago, the President invited Mussolini to board a warship and steam out to meet him somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean and talk things over. Il Duce was also requested to invite Hitler to get on a warship and meet at the appointed meridians of latitude and longitude.
“The President’s purpose was to learn from the dictators at first hand their minimum terms for pledging lasting peace, and, if he found them practicable, to offer his services as intermediary.”
American liberal statesmen have always held the illusion that the conflicts of capitalist interests could all be peacefully adjusted by a few people talking things over, but not even Wilson’s exploits at the Peace Conference can match this scheme of the President. Hitler and Mussolini, it is hardly necessary to add, did not keep the tryst.
The second news story began,
“President Roosevelt challenged the nation today to end ‘an unfounded prejudice based on age alone’, which he said, was preventing men past forty from sharing with other age groups in revival of employment, and urged all employers to determine whether middle-aged workers were receiving a ‘fair opportunity to qualify for jobs’.”
This represents his attempt to grapple with one of the great social problems today. But let it not be thought the President failed to implement his words with action. He proclaimed, over the Great Seal of the US, that Sunday, April 30, should be known as “Employment Sunday” and the following week as “Employment Week”. One pictures industrialists retiring to their studies on “Employment Sunday” to mull over the President’s proclamation, following this period of quiet thought with “Employment Week”, six—or rather, five — days of busy planning with their aides as to how to take on more workers over forty. The opening sentences of the President’s proclamation must have caused them to knit their brows in earnest:
“As industry and business make substantial progress towards recovery, there are ever-increasing employment opportunities for all groups.”
From this, it follows logically that the older worker can and should be given his fair share of these new jobs. Yet, actually, the older worker is being laid off wholesale. It would seem that this returning prosperity and increasing employment exist only in the same private dream world which produced this amazing state paper.
The third and most important news story was headlined: “PRESIDENT ASKS $1,750,000,000 FOR THE 1940 RELIEF PROGRAM.” In the current fiscal year (which ends July 1) relief appropriations have totalled $2,250,000,000 and an average of 3,000,000 persons have been employed on WPA. Next year, the President proposes to cut down the appropriation by one-third, and to reduce the WPA rolls to 2,000,000.
“The sums asked,” reports the Times, “produced little unfavorable reaction in Congress.”
The sham battle between the White House and Congress over relief has now ended in the former’s going over completely to the “enemy” camp. And how does the President justify his proposal to cut off 1,000,000 American citizens from relief? In the entire message, whose text takes up four full newspaper columns, I can find just one sentence of explanation:
“Barring unforeseen and unpredictable developments, we are justified in expecting an upward trend in the volume of employment between now and June 30, 1940, and the sum just named represents my judgment as to the amount that should be provided on the basis of that expectation.”
The President does not give the data by which he arrived at this conclusion. Certainly, the dry, humdrum, everyday figures of carloadings and steel tonnage and employment totals which are to be found in the financial pages of the papers don’t bear him out.
But as one reads his message, one realizes that the President apparently doesn’t think he is cutting relief. With a noble humanitarian scorn he writes:
“When those who talk glibly or without information about cutting down the cost of relief are pinned down to the facts, they are obliged to admit that they can offer only two alternative plans: to cut down the number of needy persons receiving relief or to cut down the per capita work payments.”
To the ordinary, earthbound observer, it would seem that to propose reducing the WPA rolls by one-third would be “to cut down the number of needy persons receiving relief”.
But this is cloud cuckoo land, where the head of the most powerful capitalist state in the world proposes to solve the problems of war and unemployment by proposing, respectively, a meeting of three men in the middle of the Atlantic and the proclamation of “National Employment Week”. If the President acts thus, it is not because there is some malign streak of insanity in his make-up. It is simply because these last few months have subjected the whole structure of bourgeois society to such unheard-of strains that all statesmen unfortunate enough to be in power at this time are acting like lunatics.
 
The Monopoly Committee (Continued)
The present Congress is one of the most reactionary in our history. It has voted funds to continue the Dies Committee, and it has killed off the LaFollette Committee just as the whole story of the most threatening quasi-fascist group in the country, the Associated Farmers out on the West coast, was about to be spread on the committee’s records. It seems to me, therefore, of some significance that this Congress several weeks ago voted, without even a formal debate, the full $600,000 which the Monopoly Committee asked for its next year’s work. Clearly, the Monopoly Committee is considered “safe” on Capitol Hill.
Since the last New International went to press, the strategy of the Monopoly Committee has emerged with unmistakable clarity. This strategy is, roughly, to offset the solid concession’s it makes to big business with piously phrased professions of goodwill towards little business. Thus on April 4, the papers carried a story: “NEW DEAL MAPS AID TO SMALL BUSINESS,” which announced that the SEC, the Monopoly Committee, and the Junior Chamber of Commerce (composed of small business firms) were working together on a survey “to get the facts behind all the talk about small business enterprises not being able to get adequate capital and to provide for the small business unit the kind of research and economic advisory services which big business provides for itself.” Douglas, Frank, and Hopkins are all mixed up in this scheme, whose beauty is that it sounds fine and doesn’t actually mean anything at all. To finance a research bureau to serve the hundreds of thousands of small business enterprises throughout the land, Messrs. Frank and Douglas propose a governmental appropriation of $2,000,000 or $3,000,000, which is less than a single great corporation like US Steel or General Electric spends annually on industrial research. And as for federal loans to small businesses, the more the government pours into such enterprises, the bigger the pool of capital to be annexed by the great corporations when they get around to it. Not lack of financing but ruthless competition from big business is behind the rapid expropriation of small capital in this country. It would be insulting to the intelligence of Messrs. Douglas and Frank to suggest that they don’t know this perfectly well.
Six days later, on April 10, the tactical meaning of this gesture came out. That morning the Times carried a frontpage story headlined: “SENATE COMMITTEE INVITES BUSINESS TO TELL GRIEVANCES.” According to Chairman O’Mahoney, the hearings conducted to date by the Monopoly Committee represent the more aggressive and inquisitorial phase of the Committee’s work—the real old-fashioned trust-busting stuff. Now, the Chairman announced, business is to have “its turn”: the Committee is opening up “a new phase of its duties, particularly designed to afford business and industry an opportunity, in cooperation with the Committee, to present its own story of the nation’s economic problems”. The witness stand will now be turned over to all business groups which request it. There is no restriction on the kind of testimony, which may include “criticism of existing governmental ... policies”. So now, after three months of the most timid and innocuous sort of hearings, the Committee is offering itself as a sounding board for business propaganda. At once, the oil and the milk industries requested—and were granted—the use of the Committee’s witness stand. It is probably merely a coincidence that both these industries have recently been in difficulties with the Attorney General’s office over a little matter of anti-trust law violation. And so we shall soon have the comic spectacle of Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold prosecuting Sherman Law violators in the morning and listening in the afternoon to the same gentlemen lecture him and his colleagues on the iniquities of the Sherman Law.
 




World’s Fair Tale
You have probably seen photographs in the papers of the Soviet pavilion at the New York World’s Fair: a towering monstrosity, streamlined up to an enormous statue of a man in overalls holding aloft, in a Statue-of-Liberty attitude, a large star. The architect is Boris Yofan, most renowned of present-day Soviet architects, who did a similar job for the Paris Exposition, substituting for the man in overalls a pair of muscular young people in shorts.
Yofah also did the Palace of the Soviets in Moscow; whose colonnaded tiers rise up like a huge wedding cake to form a pedestal for a gigantic Statue of Lenin. That there is something esthetically grotesque in a building serving as the pedestal of a statue – and what statues! – this bit of grammar school architectural lore has yet to penetrate the Russian steppes.
At any rate, there is quite a story connected with Yofan’s latest monstrosity. It seems – according to some one who should know – that many months ago a pair of Soviet architects arrived in this country with a plan for a Soviet building at the Fair. This was submitted to the Fair’s architectural board, which, as is the routine, criticised it and suggested certain changes so as to bring it into harmony with the surrounding buildings. The architects went back to Moscow, and no more has been heard over here of either of them.
This winter Yofan and an associate, K.S. Alabian, arrived in New York and presented an entirely different plan. On examining this one, the Fair’s architectural board found that its ground plan was some fifty feet bigger than the space allotted to the building and, furthermore, that its central tower, bearing the workman-and-star, was one hundred and eighty feet high, which was just one hundred feet higher than the top limit which had been set for all governmental buildings at the Fair. The board was, therefore, about to return, the plans with a request for drastic revisions when a wire came from the State Department in Washington.
Its general gist was that the two previous architects had been liquidated because their plan had been criticised, and that it would be much appreciated if the Yofan-Alabian plans could be approved by the board without any major changes. So the board, being kindly fellows, let the tower stand – it is the second highest structure at the Fair, being eclipsed only by the Trylon itself – and, to give room for the extra fifty feet of ground space, moved over three adjoining buildings, one of them being, incidentally, the Japanese pavilion. Yofah returned in triumph to Moscow, where he was fittingly honored. And just before he sailed, he gave to the press an interview in which he made a number of contemptuous remarks about the bourgeois architects of the United States.
 

Footnote on the Romanovs
“More than 600 volumes of early nineteenth century fiction which came from the Imperial Library at Tsarskoe-Selo have been purchased by the University Library ... The books came from that section of the private library of Nicholas II which was housed in the Alexander Palace. There they must have remained on the shelves, undisturbed by the curiosity of the Emancipator or of his descendants. Otherwise, it is hard to account for their amazingly fresh condition, the completeness of the sets and the fact that many of them are found in the original paper covers just as they were issued.” From The Princeton Alumni Weekly, April 15, 1938.
 

More Afterthoughts
In my role of unofficial critic and reviewer of S.W.P. demonstrations. I found myself the other night on the campus of the City College of New York, taking in the Yipsels’ anti-war strike. The meeting was held outside one of the college buildings, and attracted perhaps two hundred people. The Stalinized American Students Union, which for good reasons the college authorities “recognize” as the official anti-war student group, held its meeting at the same time, in the Great Hall of the college, with Joseph P. Lash and Heywood Broun as the chief speakers. I poked my nose into the Great Hall long enough to estimate the attendance there at about 1,000. The contrast between these figures is sad, but it reflects no discredit on the Yipsels. They had plenty of banners, red flare lights, and slogans chanted in unison, as well as some excellent speakers. The smallness of the crowd they drew simply reflects the great strides the war spirit has made on our campuses.
There is, however, one criticism I would like to make. In the early part of the meeting, a number of Stalinists stood on the fringes of the crowd and shouted appeals to passing students to go to their meeting. These cries were so loud as to make it hard to hear the speakers. Finally, a few stalwart comrades presented themselves before the disrupters and, without having to actually use force, were able to convince them their place was elsewhere. After that, the meeting went on peacefully. I should say that this should have been done much sooner, and that only such a show of force – however much the danger of breaking up the meeting entirely – will silence such disturbers. I say this realizing quite well, of course, that force – or even the threat of it – is a two-edged weapon at radical meetings.
 




Stagecoach
As I noted here several weeks ago, the film Stagecoach, didn’t please the editors of the N.Y. Times who objected to its treatment of American history because it presents the banker as a rascal and the town woman as a heroine. But last night I happened to see the film, and I must report that, whatever its deficiencies as patriotic propaganda, it is the most entertaining and exciting movie I’ve seen in a long time. Stagecoach is a straight old-style “Western,” with the usual characters – comic stage-driver, lean and saturnine gambler, picturesque-drunk-who-has-seen-better-days, hearty-voiced sheriff, handsome and inarticulate “good” bad man, dance-hall-girl-with-golden-heart, etc. – and the usual climax in a terrific fight with Apaches which ends with the last-minute arrival of the Federal cavalry, bugles blowing and flags streaming. But these ingredients, properly treated, can make excellent cinema: the “Western” has naturally speed, action, and pictorial splendor, which is why it is the one kind of movie that has been made steadily and in quantity ever since the days of Edison’s nickleodeon. Stagecoach is about the best Western I remember seeing. It owes its quality largely to the direction of John Ford, who several years ago made an excellent film from Liam O’Flaherty’s book, The Informer. In this film, as in that, Ford shows himself a master at building up suspense. The Apaches here, the Irish Republican Army there, make their sinister, waiting presence felt all through the film – and the final explosion of action is as well done here as the Black and Tans’ house raid was in The Informer.
 

Revivals
While I am on the subject of movies, I might note that those who are interested in the cinema, as I am, as something more than a way to kill an evening, will shortly have a chance to see the cream of the best collection of old films in this country, that of the Museum of Modern Art. The Museum has arranged a series of thirty revival programs, which it will begin to show on May 11, and which will be repeated throughout the summer, up to October 1. Four of D. W. Griffith’s greatest films will be shown: The Birth of a Nation (May 13), Intolerance (May 14), Broken Blossoms (May 15), and Way Down East (May 16). Other specially notable revivals are: The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (May 17), Murnau’s The Last Laugh (May 23), Von Stroheim’s Greed (May 24), Pabst’s The Love of Jeanne Ney (May 29), Von Sternberg’s Underworld (June 2), Milestone’s All Quiet on the Western Front (June 4), and LeRoy’s Little Caesar (June 6). The showings will be at the Museum (11 West 53rd St., New York City), will be continuous afternoons and evenings, and will be free to all who pay the 25 cents admission charge to get into the Museum itself.
 

Ten Months of Evianism
Last July all the “democratic” powers sent delegates to the Evian Conference to devise ways and means of helping refugees from Nazi Germany. The Conference set up the Intergovernmental Committee on Political Refugees, which has now been functioning ten months with practically no results. The chief villain here is England. The British delegation to Evian did its best to kill the whole business then and there. Failing, the British at least got their man, Lord Winterton, who happens to be a known anti-Semite, made titular head of the Refugee Committee, and the headquarters located in London, where early in February, the American, George Rublee, resigned as active director of the committee and another Englishmen took his post. It was clear that the long drawn-out pretense of “doing something about the refugees” was about to be given up.
The Evian Committee’s obituary was written in a Berlin dispatch from Otto D. Tolischus in the N.Y. Times for April 25. Commenting on the complete breakdown of arrangements for receiving Jewish refugees into other countries, Mr. Tolischus writes:
“The hopes for easier emigration that the German Jews had pinned on the Evian Committee and on George Rublee’s negotiations with the German government have failed to materialize thus far. Little if anything has been done to create the machinery agreed upon between Mr. Rublee and the German government, and the general impression in German-Jewish quarters is that the main responsibility for this rests neither on the German authorities nor on the general war scare but on a certain lack of interest in those British quarters put in charge of the Evian committee’s work.”
The refugee question, all hypocritical moralizing to the contrary, is a matter of economics pure and simple. Germany wants to rid herself of the burden of the Jews, and to strip them of their property in the process. (The only class of Jews the Nazis discourage from emigrating are surgeons, who will be useful in patching up the by-products of the next war.) And the Jews find no refuge on the whole globe because of what Mr. Tolischus bluntly calls “the steadily increasing disinclination of other countries to accept virtually penniless refugees.”
 




Ungilded Lily
It would be gilding the lily to comment on the following “society item” from the N.Y. World-Telegram for May 16:
“Tommy Krock, long-lost member of the Manhattan stag line, turned up with a neatly clipped mustache and a monocle. ‘I’ve lost touch with my New York friends,’ he told Elizabeth Churchill who, with her fiancé, Tom Stoneborough, stopped for a chat. ‘I’ve been fighting in Spain with Franco for eighteen months. I expect to be here till September attending to a few munition deals.’ Mrs. Oliver B. Jennings, her hat composed of two bluebirds diving into two pink roses, accepted a cocktail from Nicky de Molas.”
 

The Protean Father Sheen
These are bewildering days. The political kaleidoscope clicks into new patterns overnight, the pieces getting all scrambled up again just as one had become accustomed to the old arrangement. The other day, for example, the Reverend Fulton Sheen, associate professor of philosophy in Catholic University, defined a “two-thirds American” as “one who condemns Nazism and Fascism without saying anything about Communism.” He also remarked of Hitler and Stalin: “They are both dictators. They both suppress minorities. They both say that all rights come from the state.” There is nothing remarkable about such remarks coming from a mildly liberal Catholic priest – except that it struck me that these formulations are almost identical with the statements made in the Hook-Dewey manifesto on behalf of “cultural freedom”. Father Sheen also revealed the Man-Behind-Stalin. His name is Satan. Again, nothing so strange in this from a Catholic priest. But, unless I am much mistaken, the priest who is even now giving Heywood Broun his spiritual preparations for his imminent entry into the Church of Rome is none other than this same Father Fulton Sheen. May we shortly expect Comrade Broun to purge the American Newspaper Guild of the followers of Stalin and Satan?
 

The Manton Case
Up to a few months ago, Martin Thomas Manton was the tenth ranking judge in the Federal judiciary system, coming next in line after the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. The revelation that Judge Manton for years had been selling his decisions to the highest bidder was the most sensational of a whole series of scandals which have been suddenly breaking out in all parts of the judiciary system. After months of delay, Judge Manton has finally been put on trial. His defense is in the competent hands of Mr. Noonan of Albany and Mr. Golder of Philadelphia. Mr. Noonan used to be Arthur (“Dutch Schultz”) Flegenheimer’s lawyer, and Mr. Golder used to represent Al Capone.
There are two episodes in Judge Manton’s long career on the bench which the press seems to have overlooked so far. One is the second Masses trial during the last war, the one in which Max Eastman made his brilliant three-hour speech against war and for socialism. The presiding justice was none other than Martin T. Manton, who had just been appointed to the bench by President Wilson. A more recent, and typical, episode was the Associated Gas & Electric case. For years A.G.E. was the major scandal of the utility industry, which is a large statement. Its corporate structure, for good reasons, was of a complexity remarkable even for a utility holding company, so complicated, in fact, that it used to be said that only the little-known and rather sinister Howard C. Hopson, mastermind of A.G.E., could really understand it. Sitting spiderlike in the middle of the great web of interlocking subsidiaries he had created, Mr. Hopson successfully defied investors and consumers for years. The Securities Exchange Commission has finally, after a long struggle, forced A.G.E. to some measure of house-cleaning. But back in the days when Mr. Hopson had things his own way, his trail crossed that of Judge Manton.
In June 1934, certain security holders of A.G.E. filed suit under Section 77-b to reorganize the company. It took Federal Judge Julian W. Mack a year to cut sufficiently through the legal red tape put in his way by the A.G.E. lawyers to declare there was a prima facie case of insolvency and to issue an injunction. It took him another year, until June 1936, to issue an order calling for the examination of the company’s books. Alarmed, Hopson’s lawyers asked for Judge Mack’s disqualification on the ground of “bias.” Another Federal judge dismissed this charge as “frivolous.” Then, at last, the desperate utility magnate played his last, and as it turned out, trump card. The tenth ranking Federal judge in the land suddenly stepped into the case and over-ruled both Judge Mack and Judge Patterson.
It would be interesting to know what galvanized Judge Manton into action.
 

Book Note
Thorstein Veblen wrote a number of important books which are now out of print, notably The Theory of Business Enterprise and The Engineers and the Price System. So far as I know, indeed, the only one of his books that is still in print is The Theory of the Leisure Class, which can be had in the Modern Library edition. It should, therefore, be great good news that Viking is reissuing one of Veblen’s books. But the volume selected turns out to be one of his minor works: Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution. This was written during the last war, and Viking makes it quite clear that it is now being revived as part of the cultural preparations for the next war:
“When Lewis Mumford in Men Must Act said, ‘Veblen’s book should be reissued as a contemporary document, which it is,’ Viking decided the time had come to heed the suggestion.”
To quote the Bard: “The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.”
 




Time Marches On!
“Socialism and jingoism seem to mix very well in England. During the last general election, one of the biggest guns on the Tory side was the German war-scare letters, written for the Daily Mail by Robert Blatchford, who is easily at the head of Socialist journalism in Great Britain. More recently, the big-navy cry has been raised by that veteran leader of uncompromising British socialism, H.M. Hyndman. The aristocratic Morning Post is the medium in this case.
“Socialist Hyndman is explicit. In the first place, England must have a Navy in order to safeguard her food supply. In the second place, she must have a Navy to safeguard the right of asylum for political refugees from other countries. In the third place, England has in her charge the liberties of the smaller nations, who look to her as their protector. Finally, England must be in a position to defend her own freedom. For these reasons, Socialist Hyndman is at one with those Tories who want a special loan for warship building, which is strange company, indeed, for the best-known English advocate of international socialism.” – (From The Nation, July 21, 1910)
 

C.I.O. and W.P.A.
When President Roosevelt several weeks ago asked Congress to reduce the W.P.A. rolls from 3,000,000 to 2,000,000, a deep silence spread over a large part of the labor and left-wing press. Had anyone dropped a pin in the editorial offices of The Daily Worker, the echoes would have been deafening. Nor did The New Leader consider the episode worthy of any major headlines. This is perhaps hardly strange, considering the political commitments to the New Deal of such groups. But John L. Lewis and his C.I.O. have less definite commitments and a more immediate interest in a big W.P.A. appropriation. And yet The C.I.O. News was as silent as The Daily Worker on the subject of the President’s message. Reading the News, indeed, one would not even know that the President had sent the message to Congress at all. The paper has a regular department called, apparently without irony: “YOUR W.P.A. JOB.” The week the President’s message appeared, this department was entirely devoted to a description of the beauties of a new plan for reorganizing relief activities which had just come out of the White House – but not a word on the one-third cut which had also just come out of the White House. Elsewhere in the same issue, the News had an indignant story about the pending W.P.A. cuts. This stated that 200,000 workers were about to lose their jobs “as a result of the cut in W.P.A. funds engineered by Congressional Tories” – but, again, not a word about the 1,000,000 W.P.A.’ers the President had just proposed to cut off the rolls.
I had almost lost my faith in The C.I.O News when, in the issue of May 15, it finally came out boldly against cutting W.P.A. to 2,000,000. On the front page was a big headline: “LEWIS URGES W.P.A. JOBS FOR THREE MILLION.” The YOUR W.P.A. JOB column begins: “The C.I.O. has fired the opening gun in its national campaign to make the W.P.A. adequately serve the needs of the unemployed during the next fiscal year.” This opening gun is a letter from the pen of John L. Lewis himself protesting against any cut in next year’s W.P.A. appropriation and giving in bold and stirring language a number of excellent reasons why the 3,000,000 figure must be kept as a minimum. A really splendid letter! But Mr. Lewis’s secretary must have gotten the address wrong. It is addressed not to “The Hon. Franklin D. Roosevelt, The White House,” but to “The Hon. Edward Taylor, Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, House of Representatives.”
 

Mountain Labors, Bears Mouse (Dead)
At long last the group of intellectuals of which Professor Sidney Hook is the leading spirit has made its public debut. The group began in a small way last fall as “The League Against Totalitarianism.” It has been gathering recruits ever since, and now it comes out in the N.Y. Times as “The Committee for Cultural Freedom” with a ringing denunciation of all tyranny and despotism wherever it may rear its ugly head, whether in Fascist Italy and Germany or in Soviet Russia. Politics makes strange bedfellows, and anti-totalitarian, bourgeois liberal politics makes the strangest of all. Among the ninety-six members of the Committee are such mates as Walter Damrosch and John Dos Passos, Louis Adamic and Henry Hazlitt, Sherwood Anderson and Willi Schlamm, James Rorty and Dorothy Thompson. I hesitate to quibble over a document signed by so many eminent names, and it seems odd that one should have to bring the point to the attention of so justly renowned a Marxist as Sidney Hook, but it seems to me that there are only two social bases from which one can fight totalitarianism, whether Red or Black, namely: the workers or the bourgeoisie. The Committee’s manifesto is silent on the question of socialism and social revolution. And so it plays the game of the bourgeoisie, and its denunciation of Stalinism takes on a reactionary character. As I recall the Honorable Martin Dies has also put himself on record against all forms of dictator ship, whether Fascist or Communist. And the headline-writer of the N.Y. Times shows that he grasps clearly enough the “point” of Professor Hook’s Committee – the “point”, that is, in relation to the objective line-up of social forces, regardless of what the left-wing members of the Committee may hope and believe they are accomplishing – when he writes the sub-head: “96 SCHOLARS AND ARTISTS LED BY JOHN DEWEY REVOLT AGAINST FAILURE TO DENOUNCE REDS.”
 




Hard Times at the Library
A headline in today’s paper reads: “LACK OF FUNDS COMPELS LIBRARY TO CURTAIL USE OF READING ROOMS.” Free libraries and free schools have long been among the proudest boasts of bourgeois democracy. These concessions were won by the masses in the heyday of capitalism, when the ruling class could afford them. But the shadows are closing in on this kind of “democracy.” In the last few months the processes of free education have broken down in an alarming way here and there throughout the country – a highly significant trend of which I shall have something to say in another place. And now comes the announcement that the special reference rooms of the New York Public Library – American history, art, music, science, periodicals, newspapers, etc. – will close at six every night (instead of ten) and will not be open at all on Sundays (instead of being open from one to ten p.m.). An average of 1,500 persons use these rooms on week, nights, and from 3,000 to 4,000 on Sundays. Most of these are probably workers, who can come in only in their off hours. For them, the “public” library has become inaccessible.
This is, of course, by no means the first such retrenchment. Year after year, as the depression has worn on, the library has been buying fewer books, cutting down on salaries, curtailing its services to the reading public. And more economies will have to be practiced before long, according to the president of the board of trustees, Frank L. Polk, of the great corporation law firm: Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Gardner and Reed. The difficulty, according, to Mr. Polk, is that the library’s budget is unbalanced. And how much is needed to restore the balance – and also the essential services just cut out? Some huge sum, doubtless, or our enlightened and progressive city administration would never have allowed the library, to be thus crippled! Well, believe it or not, the sum needed is exactly $190,000. I daresay Mr. Polk makes at least that much all by himself in one year’s practice of corporation law.
 

Herr Professor LaGuardia
In the column right next to the announcement of the public library’s difficulties, there is a long story headed: “MAYOR AND AIDES TO TEACH AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY.” The title of the course which the Mayor and his aides are to give is Government and Administration of New York City. I suggest that in the first lecture, the leaders of the LaGuardia administration – which is probably as “advanced” and “liberal” a big city government as you will find in this country at the moment – explain why it seems to them wiser to spend $40,000,000 on a new bridge from Manhattan to Brooklyn than $190,000 to keep the city’s chief library open at night; why it is more important to spend tens of millions on an East Side Express Highway, to allow people in pleasure cars to get downtown ten minutes quicker, than to spend $190,000 to allow workers to use the library after the day’s work is over; why Mr. Moses gets his tens of millions for fancy luxury projects like Jones Beach and Mr. Whalen gets his subsidy for the high-priced and useless World of Tomorrow, while $190,000 is considered too much to pay to maintain vital services at the city’s main public library.
 

Our Four-Billion-Dollar Baby
I must confess I had some sneaking doubts about this American democracy we are all to die for in the next war when I read two recent news items. Almost on the same day, the Social Security Board revealed that the average earnings in 1937 of the 30,166,000 wage earners on its rolls came to just $890; while the Ways & Means Committee of the House published the salaries of some 50,000 of these wage-earners who had received $15,000 or more each in 1937. It is a long step from $890 to the $1,296,000 which went to Mr. Mayer of the films, or the $500,000 which went to Mr. Hearst of the newspapers, or the $419,000 which went to President Watson of International Business Machines Corp., or the $381,000 which President Hill received from the American Tobacco Co.
But then I reflected on a third governmental report which has just appeared, and I realized that all of us, rich and poor alike, share the common ownership of a magnificent property worth currently about $4,000,000,000. This report is the Naval Expense Account for the fiscal year 1938, a matter of eighty-six pages of figures. The man-in-the-street, struggling to feed his family on $893 a year, often fails to realize he is co-owner of four billion dollars worth of guns and torpedoes and armor plate, including $420,000,000 worth of heavy and light cruisers, $275,000,000 worth of destroyers, $328,000 worth of “flags and bunting,” and $33 worth of livestock. It is a comforting thought. I figure that each and every one of the 120,000,000 inhabitants of this great democracy owns just $32.50 worth of the above-named commodities. If no one minds, I’ll take mine in cash, please.
 



Notes on a War
The catchword of the warmongers of the left is: “This war is different” – varied by “1939 is not 1914”. The implication is that, whatever the imperialistic taint of the last war, this time the issue is really vital to the security and happiness of the world. But the difference between the two wars on this score seems to be to be all in favor of the last war. In the twenty-five years that have elapsed since 1914, capitalism as a social system has enormously deteriorated. Fascism is the ultimate expression of this decay, but in the great “democracies” the process has also been going on. The last war was the catastrophe which marked the end of the old “free” capitalism of the last century, the end of Victorian rationalism, of the rosy illusions of reformism and Bismarckian “state socialism”, of the Manchester school of free trade and universal popular education and a dozen other quaint nostrums for the cancer that was even then eating away at capitalism. When the last war began, the reformist and liberal politicians who so effectively led the masses to the slaughtering pens were able to present the war as a final struggle to crush the diabolical enemy who would destroy all these things. The French and English masses were told they were fighting for parliamentary democracy against “autocracy” and “militarism”, and Wilson’s soap bubble vision of a League of Nations floated unpunctured above the trenches. Likewise, the German masses were told by the Social Democracy they were defending the fatherland of international socialism from Czarism and British imperialism. Both sides therefore marched off to battle with bands playing, flags flying proudly, and social-patriotic orators confidently proclaiming the noble aims of the war. Every one thought the war would “settle” things once and for all, and that the world would be, in Wilson’s phrase, “a better place to live in” once the victory had been won.
The crusading exaltation with which the masses went to war in 1914 is nowhere in evidence today. The troops have marched off to the battlefield and the civilian populations have gone about the complicated business of preparing against bombing and gassing from the air. in a numb, sullen spirit which only a propaganda ministry dares to call “sober resolve” or “grim determination”. If every one woke up with the jitters in the cold grey dawn of 1919, this time the party is beginning with the handover. Not even the liberal-reformist politicians can see any real perspectives for capitalism in the future. The events of the last twenty-five years have exposed to every one what in the pre-1914 period only a few Marxists understood: that war, mass misery, and increasing economic chaos are inseparable from the development of monopoly capitalism. Not even reformist politicians venture to put forth for public consumption any optimistic visions of a better world once Hitler is crushed. Not even the liberal weeklies dare to speculate very closely on what the “democracies” will do with their victory – if they win it. On the “democratic” side, this is a purely defensive war, a desperate rear-guard action with no perspective more ambitious than “Stop Hitler!” at its end. Therefore, the less said about war aims, the better. As Lord Linlithgow informed the Indian Congress Party the other day: “His Majesty’s Government have not themselves defined with any ultimate precision their objectives in the prosecution of the war, and it is obvious that such a definition can only come at a later stage of the campaign ...” Obviously.
* * *
Another difference between this war and the last one is that war came in 1914 with dramatic unexpectedness, while this time it has been tensely expected by everyone for years.
Even after the Sarajevo assassination in 1914 no one except a few highly placed diplomats and politicians who were on the inside and knew what was brewing, and a few Marxists who were on the outside but were able to judge the situation accurately by theoretical analysis – no one really thought it would come to a general European war. But during all those years when the entire liberal-reformist movement of Europe, from the “Marxist” social democrats Jaurès and Bernstein to the bourgeois liberal Lloyd George, were talking of the “new order” of gradual, peaceful, evolutionary progress under capitalism, in all those years the economic contradictions and basic imperialist antagonisms had been steadily building up to the explosion point. When the blow-up finally came, it was to the masses and their leaders a totally unexpected eruption of hidden, half-forgotten forces.
Taken by surprise, the masses in 1914 were easily whipped into a war hysteria. It would all be over in a few months, and victory would “settle” things once for all, so that the march of social progress could be resumed. It was possible, furthermore, for the apologists for capitalism to present the last war as a sort of natural, accidental catastrophe – an avalanche brought thundering down on Europe by the pistol shots at Sarajevo. This time, however, there is no such element of surprise in the outbreak of war. By now, war is seen clearly even by the masses to be no accident of nature. It has emerged nakedly as the normal mode of life for the decaying capitalist system. It is true that the labor movement is weaker this time than in 1914, and that there is less militant, organized opposition to war. But it is also true that the masses this time have fewer illusions about the causes of war and the good results to be hoped for from war. Apathy, passive submission, resignation, cynicism – such seems to be the popular mood at the outbreak of the second world war.
The last war represented a sharp break with the normal peacetime life of Europe. Within a month of the declaration of war, military moves of the utmost scope and importance were made. Before the first half years was out, the German armies had almost captured Paris, the battle of the Marne had been fought, and Von Hindenburg and Ludendorff had dealt a crushing blow to Russia at Tannenburg and the Masurian Lakes – the greatest victories of the entire conflict. This war has so far, by comparison, been fought in slow motion. The reason for the difference is, of course, partly technical: the formidable strength of the Westwall and the Maginot Line. But it also has broader implications. Europe has been in a state of war not since September 1, 1939, but since Hitler sent his troops into the Rhineland in 1935. This war, so far as England and France at least were concerned, was conducted with diplomatic and economic weapons rather than bombs and cannon. But the threat of armed force was always very close to the surface, much closer than before the last war. The delay in seriously beginning hostilities this time is significant of the merging of war into the normal political and social structure of life which has taken place in the last quarter of a century. Clausewitz’s famous axiom about war being the continuation of politics by other means has been stood on its head: this war has been suspended while the belligerents engage in a series of political maneuvers. This time, politics turns but to be the continuation of war “by other means”. Or rather, both techniques are being used simultaneously, the propaganda battles and diplomatic campaigns in Moscow, Washington, and other “neutral” capitals playing at least as important a part as the military and naval engagements. The distinction between war and politics as imperialist techniques, or between war and peace as ways of life under capitalism, this has been broken down, and war has been fused into the normal, everyday structure of existence both of the state and the individual.
* * *
This fusion of the military and the political-social aspects of war in our time also expresses itself in the totalitarian nature of modern warfare, in which civilians and soldiers are alike exposed to death and mutilation. The bombing plane has erased the term, “non-combatant”, from the military lexicon. It would even be possible to argue that the soldiers manning the Westwall and the Maginot Line are safer in their deep burrows of steel and concrete than the civilian populations of Paris and Berlin. Thus this war has developed from a duel between professional armies first to a struggle between mass democratic armies, and finally to its present form, involving the entire population of the belligerents, without distinction as to age, sex, or uniform. War has thus come to have an increasingly social – as against purely military and technical – character. Another aspect of this is the fact that a modern army is highly mechanized and needs vast quantities of machine products, everything from time fuses to electric cookers. It has been estimated that it takes about five industrial workers behind the lines to keep one soldier supplied with the instruments of his trade. On the one hand, the civilian population behind the lines has become more and more essential to the troops in the field, and on the other hand, this same population has become increasingly exposed to the attacks of the enemy. Thus it is more than ever essential that morale on the “home front” be maintained, while it is also more than ever possible for the enemy to break this civilian morale. Even in the last war, the home front was the decisive factor : the German military machine broke down finally not because of any great Allied victories – there were none – but because the political unrest behind the lines, caused by the privations of the civil masses, finally “infected” the army. Revolutionary opposition to this war may well spread faster on the home front than among the troops in the field.
 
Socialist Stomatology
These are times that try men’s souls, especially if they were unwary enough to enlist in the ranks of the “friends of the Soviet Union”. In this dark hour, these “friends” have been scuttling off the sinking ship of the Third International in droves. The liberal weeklies have indignantly flounced out of bed; such great minds as Granville Hicks and Heywood Broun, not to mention Robert Forsyth, have ventured to express their suspicions of the Kremlin in public; “innocent” groups are folding up on every hand. But all is not lost! Stalin still has Corliss Lamont. And he still has The American Quarterly on the Soviet Union, whose current issue, performs the really remarkable feat of printing 150 pages on Soviet affairs without venturing any further on dangerous ground than reprinting (strictly without comment) the text of the Stalin-Hitler Pact and of Molotov’s speech to the Soviet Congress about it. The curious reader can enlighten himself in this magazine, published a week or two ago, on Shakespeare in the Soviet Union, Children’s Theatres in the Soviet Union, Retailing Practices in the Soviet Union, Psychology in the Soviet Union. Oriental Studies in the Soviet Union, and, the grand climax, Dentistry in the Soviet Union!
Let professional grumblers and unstable intellectuals carp as they like about the trials, the mass purges, the Pact, the invasion of Poland, here is conclusive proof that socialism has been achieved in the Soviet Union, just as Stalin says. Here, in this sensational article by Dr. Alfred J. Asgis, is evidence of the enduring quality of Soviet socialism, which persists, granite, unalterable, through all minor episodes like the alliance with Hitler. The better to handle his vast topic, Dr. Asgis divides it into three eminently reasonable headings: “(a) Dentistry in the Soviet Union in general; (b) Dental education; and (c) The growth of the dental profession in the Soviet Union.” Dr. Asgis demonstrates beyond all reasonable doubt that Socialist dentistry under Stalin has made gigantic strides forward. Tsarist Russia, for instance, in its entire miserable existence was able to produce only 200,000 sets of false teeth, while in the year 1934 alone, the city of Leningrad alone produced 800,000 sets of Marxist dentures.
Dr. Asgis is honest enough not to conceal the fact that there are flaws in this stirring record of Bolshevik victory on the Denture and Bridgework Front. Thus he frankly admits that Soviet artificial teeth “are not up to the mark in shading and range in coloring”. He also reveals the existence of. a crisis in the production of dental rubber which may well be called to Kaganovitch’s attention after he has finished with the railroads. The trouble seems to be that the Kremlin has of late been preoccupied with other matters and so has not given to dental progress the full attention it should have. In Dr. Asgis’ words: “When other aspects of Soviet life demand immediate attention, such as agriculture, national defense, industry, etc., the growth of dental industry is naturally retarded.”
This seems logical enough. But there is a more serious explanation possible of the failure of Soviet dentistry, for all its sensational victories, to conquer these weaknesses. I have no wish to get either Dr. Asgis or his dental colleagues into trouble with the Soviet authorities, but it is impossible not to read between the lines of his article certain indications of serious ideological deviations. What is one to make of a formulation such as this, for example: “The majority of Soviet physicians are inclined to accept the endogenous theory of the cause of caries, caused by disorders in metabolism and by traumatic factors of a neurotrophic character.” This sounds like Menshevik, petty-bourgeois formalism to me. And there seems to be more than a hint of Trotskyist-Bukharinist defeatism in the statement attributed to Dr. Alexander A. Limberg, Professor of Stomatology at the Medical Institute in Leningrad: “Because the emphasis is on providing dental care for the masses immediately, it is impossible for the present to carry out the ideal program of education.” A good Bolshevik, Dr. Lemberg, doesn’t blame his own failures on the masses. It is significant, also, that Dr. Asgis quotes this dangerously incorrect formulation without in any way criticising it or disassociating himself from it. It is to be hoped, for his own sake as well as for that of the Soviet masses, that Dr. Asgis will hasten to correct these deviations in an otherwise valuable article.
 




Business Looks at the War
“Without steel modern war would be impossible – Airplanes, tanks, artillery, armor plate, battleships, shells, torpedoes, barbed wire are all principally made of steel.
“The machines of war are being continually destroyed and replacements use up tremendous additional quantities of steel.
“Steel companies, during the last war, were swamped with business which proved highly profitable to them and to their stockholders.
“Steel stocks have always been among the first to respond to the stimulus of war-buying.
“We believe that sound steel stocks, purchased around current levels, will prove very profitable – repeating, in many instances, the spectacular performance of the last war.
“We have prepared reports on three very attractive steel stocks ...” – Market Letter issued by Bonner & Bonner members of N.Y. Stock Exchange.

“The most important fact about the probable effects of the war on American business is that they are likely to be meager unless and until the nature of the warfare changes.

“WE ARE NOT NEUTRAL ... The present so-called neutrality law will not of itself keep us out of direct involvement in war. Revision of the law, as asked by the President and favored by majority public opinion, will not of itself draw us into war. In the final analysis we will go to war if and when our vital interests are threatened. Otherwise not. Whether our vital interests will or will not be threatened at some later stage of this war is entirely unpredictable and will not be determined by the kind of law that Senator Borah wants or the kind that Mr. Roosevelt wants. What are our vital interests? To cite two of the most obvious, the survival of the British navy is a vital interest to us and even more so is maintenance of the status quo in our entire hemisphere, including islands as far distant as Bermuda.
“Meanwhile we engage in bitter debate on ‘neutrality’ although, in the strict sense of the term, we a.e not neutral. We are not neutral in sentiment, for we favor victory for the Allies. We are not neutral in fact, for present law permits the British and French to buy from us most of the types of materials essential to prosecution of war, while circumstances prevent such materials going to Germany.” – The Trend of Events section, Magazine of Wall Street.

The Color Line in Culture
Waite Phillips is a Tulsa, Oklahoma, oil magnate – an “oiligarch,” in Time’s vocabulary. Mr. Phillips, a great public benefactor of Tulsa, recently turned over his big Italian-style mansion to be used as an Art Center. The other day the Art Center had its grand opening. Every one in Tulsa was there, except those whose skins happened to be black. Their presence was most distinctly not requested. But the Tulsa oiligarchs are broad-minded. They recognize that it would be unjust to exclude the city’s Negroes from the cultural advantages of the Art Center. Therefore, according to Time for November 6: “One Thursday a month will be set aside as Jim Crow day at the Art Center.”
 

Blood Money
Bourgeois economists lament the disappearance of the economic frontier in American capitalism. But there does exist one last great economic frontier for world capitalism, one remaining major market for the consumption of manufactured goods – a frontier which is at present located between the Westwall and the Maginot Line. The bombing plane, furthermore, has extended the range of this sort of “consumption'’ from the actual battlefields to the whole of Europe. The beauty of air raids on industrial centers, from an economic point of view, is that not only are large quantities of those expensive and complicated mechanisms called bombs used up, but that their consumption destroys even vaster amounts of other machines and commodities on the ground. Thus is created a double-barrelled market for goods: to replace those destroyed, and to destroy still others.
Merely on the strength of such rosy prospects, our own capitalist system in the last few months has taken a new lease on life. The N.Y. Times weekly index of business activity has risen from 92.3 of “normal” in the week ending August 26 last to 104.7 in the week ending October 28. Secretary of Commerce Hopkins has reported that the national income was 550,800,000,000 in the first nine months of this year, as against $48,700,000,000 in the same period last year. The American Federation of Labor, in its monthly business survey, states that since the war crisis began to sharpen at the beginning of August, about one million and a quarter American workers have found jobs.
The New Deal has been administering to American capitalism various reformist “shots in the arm” for the last seven years. But all sections of bourgeois opinion, from the AFL bureaucracy to the big business press, agree that the outbreak of the war has done more for American business than anything ever pulled out of the hat by Roosevelt and his brain trusters. This is flatly stated by the AFL business survey, and it is editorially echoed by the N.Y. Times, chief newspaper voice of big business. "Much as one may deplore a business boom arising out of the tragedy of war,” writes the Times in its usual sanctimonious style, “it is significant that the mere expectation of war demand has done more for recovery than our actual Government spending program.”
 

Great Expectations
But it is also significant – and a little worrying – that so far the whole war boom has been based on nothing but expectations. The September merchandise exports of the United States were 17% higher than they were in the same month last year. But this increase was not to any great extent in war goods: over a third of it was in cotton, shipped under the subsidy plan, and the rest was largely other agricultural products. The war demand hasn’t yet materialized. Steel production has gone up to over 90% of capacity, and more steel is now being produced per week than ever before in our history. But this is all based on the expectation of future war orders. And if the war fails to become "serious” in the next few months, or if, even worse, some sort of peace is patched up, then American business will find itself far out on a limb.
The Continental Steel Corporation recently announced that it was setting aside in a special fund the equivalent of two-months’ earnings as a “reserve for contingencies.” The “contingency” it stated in these frank terms: “The war in Europe, together with a domestic business improvement, has brought about an inflationary condition that could be rapidly reversed if peace negotiations were effected.” Or, in plain language, peace would be a disastrous blow to the Continental Steel Corporation, as to other American corporations.
 

The First Swallow
Already the first swallow of spring has arrived, a harbinger of the fertile summertime in store for American capitalism if only the war doesn’t peter out. This is the repeal of the Embargo. Writing in last Sunday’s Times, Arthur Krock realistically summarized its significance:
“The majority in Congress was persuaded that repeal of the arms embargo was desirable for two purposes – to remove the disadvantage it imposed on Great Britain and France in fighting Germany, and to set up an industrial war machine in the United States in the interest of national security.”
As to the first point, it is reported that the aviation industry has already received from the Allies $170,000,000 worth of plane orders. England is about to launch a $1,000,000,000 war loan drive among its citizens, the proceeds from which will mainly go for the purchase of American munitions. Washington officials estimate that in the next few weeks the Allies will place over here war orders totalling $500,000,000, and in the next eight months $2,000,000,000.
Krock’s point about repeal making it possible to build up, before the United States enters the war, a big native munitions industry has also received factual confirmation in the last few days President Roosevelt has personally urged that a steel-producing center be established on the Pacific Coast to turn out armaments. Also, the French Government has announced that it is lending $5,000,000 to two American airplane manufacturers so that they can expand their plants sufficiently to produce the huge number of planes France will need. Thus Allied capital will be used to help finance the expansion of our industrial war machine. This is what American “neutrality” means in the present war.
 




Il Duce on War
If there is one thing that this war is making clear, it is that world capitalism has reached a stage of decay so advanced that the distinction between “war” and “peace” has broken down completely. Or rather, there is no longer any such thing as “normal, peace-time conditions” under capitalist economy.
This point was developed at length in the last New International, in the editorial and in my own column. And now it is stated boldly and explicitly by one of the chieftains of the enemy. According to a dispatch from Rome in today’s N.Y. Times, Premier Mussolini, in a speech addressed – significantly enough – to the Supreme Commission for Autarchy, expressed himself as follows:
“There is not an economy for peacetime and an economy for wartime. There is only a war economy, because historically ... it has been demonstrated that a state of armed warfare is a normal state of the people, at least of those living on the European continent, because even in years of so-called peace other types of war are waged, which in their turn prepare our armed warfare.
“Therefore, it is the fact, or rather the imminent fatality, of armed warfare that ought to dominate and that does dominate economy.
“He who fails to reach this conclusion is an ignoramus who has not got the right to complain or be surprised at the catastrophe toward which he is going.”
In matters like these, Il Duce speaks with the authority of an expert.
 

“We’re All Socialists Now”
The late Judge Gary of the Steel Corporation once said, “We’re all socialists now.” The general reaction to the Judge’s statement was in the nature of a belly laugh. But those were simpler times. Today Gary might well be taken quite seriously.
A proclamation was issued by a labor leader the other day to the proletariat of a certain European country: “SOCIALISM AGAINST CAPITALISM! THAT IS OUR BATTLECRY!” These words were addressed to the workers of Germany by Dr. Robert Ley, head of Hitler’s “Labor Front.” The war aims of Germany Dr. Ley defined as “the complete destruction of England and the domination of her moneybags over the rest of the people on the globe.” (It might be added that the main point of Dr. Ley’s message to the German workers was that their working day was to be increased two hours – at no extra pay.)
Thus the Nazis are beginning to raise on high the banner of socialism. Perhaps even more extraordinary, the rulers of the Soviet Union have also taken this banner out of the Kremlin attic and have flung it to the breeze, exuding a strong odor of mothballs. Charlie McCarthy Molotov denounces the war as an imperialist blood bath. Charlie McCarthy Browder damns the Roosevelt Administration as the tool of the bourgeoisie and even ventures a few unkind words about the Roman Catholic Church. And the puppet master in the Kremlin smokes his genial pipe in approval, removing it only to ask for a few more islands in the Gulf of Finland.
 

Rousseau to Ribbentrop
It may be objected that it is laboring the obvious to point such contradictions between the words of power politicians and their deeds. From time immemorial, statesmen have veiled their real policies in the handsomest available ideological trappings. However, I think there is an interesting difference in the way such trappings have been used in the past and the way they are used today.
In the youth of capitalism, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, no one made any serious effort to pretend that there was anything very real or eternal about the verbal rationalizations used in the game of power politics. The language of diplomacy, was, of course, highly euphemistic; nor did statesmen fail to appeal to the noblest human sentiments in covering up whatever particular piece of skullduggery they were perpetrating at the moment. But it was generally understood that these high-minded phrases were simply the poker chips of the game, to be shoved about from day to day among the players as suited the tactical needs of the moment. Statesmen went through the forms just as lawyers go through the forms of talking about justice in our courts today – and with just as cynically realistic an understanding that it was all form and talk.
Then along came Rousseau and the rights of man and all sorts of other humanitarian and idealistic doctrines, finding their political expression in the French Revolution. There also arose the idea, hitherto unknown, that the people had certain democratic rights and that policies must be justified by their beneficial effect on the great majority of mankind. The liberal bourgeois politicians of the nineteenth century spent their lives in eloquently enunciating these high-minded, inspiring principles. It is true that the necessities of capitalism forced them constantly to act in sharp contradiction to their words. But if they wore an ideological costume to hide the shocking nakedness of capitalist exploitation, it was at least always the same costume. Gladstone was an old humbug, but he was eternally and consistently false to the same set of principles.
 

The Ideological Wardrobe
But where Gladstone got himself up in the same liberal costume all his life, Hitler and Stalin have a whole ideological wardrobe. Just as the King of England has one uniform for visiting the fleet, another for receiving the Lord Mayor of London, and so on, so Hitler, though he goes everywhere in the same belted uniform, changes ideological costumes according to whether his audience is made up of capitalists or workers. Molotov’s recent remark about fascism being “a matter of taste” – as though it were a question of choosing a new hat – is clearly in this spirit.
What the totalitarian regimes are now showing us is a weird combination of the eighteenth and the nineteenth century usages in these matters. They feel the nineteenth century’s need for gaining mass democratic sanctions for their policies, for shrouding their dirty work in high-sounding phrases of concern for the well-being of The People. But at the same time, they manipulate these ideological garments with the cynical abruptness of eighteenth century politics, changing from one cosmic, all-embracing philosophy to its opposite with the facility of a Metternich substituting one diplomatic formula for another.
In the last few months, the Kremlin and its mouthpieces have used indifferently, as instruments to be picked up or tossed aside according to the turn of events from day to day, the idealistic phrases of liberal bourgeois democracy and the impassioned rhetoric of Marxist revolution. When these bewildering changes of costume are possible, it is more important than ever for all who sincerely believe in the revolutionary road to cut through the jungle of phrases to the hard political reality underneath. Also to make this clear to the workers, lest they fail to differentiate between Stalin’s fake “Marxism” and the real thing.
 




The Food Stamp Plan Again
When I wrote in the New International several months ago about the Government’s ingenious orange and blue stamp plan for feeding the unemployed on Federal “surplus commodities”, I looked long and earnestly into the mouth of that particular gift horse.
There was at that time a plan to extend the sale of food stamps to families not on relief whose income was less than $19.50 a week. As I pointed out then, this move, although it meant an immediate gain in living standards for these non-relief poor families, had some dangerous long-range implications.
One of these was that it tended to extend the stamp plan as a substitute for relief, since in many communities local officials, regardless of the intentions of Washington, would so use the plan. Another, which applies to the whole food stamp plan despite the raptures with which the liberal press has greeted it, is that the substitution of food stamps for cash relief is a step backward towards the old food basket relief of Hooverian days. Finally, this extension of Government control over the consumption habits of those on relief – and, in this latest development of the non-relief poorer families – was one more step in the process of tying down the masses with bureaucratic regulations.
 

Too Many Guinea Pigs!
The WPA’s plan was to try out the new extension of the food stamp idea first in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma. Recently, “after considerable delay”, this initial test experiment got under weigh. A report in the N.Y. Times explains the reasons for this delay. At first, all non-relief families with an income of under $19.50 a week were declared eligible for food stamps. “A survey of the county, however, showed that such a maximum would place on the eligibility list almost half the families in the county.”
Thus the social breakdown of American capitalism has already gone so far – hail the American Standard of Living, at $19.50 per family per week! – that it is now found impossible to increase the income of the masses even in the niggardly and bureaucratic way proposed by the food stamp plans. The WPA officials temporarily avoided this difficulty by arbitrarily restricting the test experiment to four hundred families. But the other thousands of families with incomes of $19.50 a week down still exist in Pottawatomie County. And they must still be reckoned with once the new plan gets out of the test tube stage.
 

Footnote on Girdler
If the Supreme Court upholds the recent decision of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Tom Girdler’s Republic Steel Company will have to rehire 5,000 employees fired during the 1937 steel strike. It will also have to pay each of them back wages for the entire period since the strike, an act of enforced philanthropy which will probably cost Republic in the vicinity of $7,500,000.
Republic, which was put together just before the 1929 crash by the high-flying Cyrus Baton, has never been able to accumulate the fat cash reserves of the other big steel companies. Financially, Republic has always been the weak link in the chain of the steel industry. If it actually has to pay out any such sum as $7,500,000, Republic may be crippled or even put out of business.
This would be tough on Tom Girdler. But I must admit that this particular human tragedy leaves me unmoved. If ever there is a fascist drive to power in this country, Girdler will be one of the ringleaders. Even in the steel industry, Girdler stands out for his personal ruthlessness and barbarism. There is something warped and subhuman about his personality. He is a great hunter and horseman, and he makes it clear that he infinitely prefers horses to men. The only time I ever saw him, years ago, long before the Little Steel Strike and the Massilon and Memorial Day massacres, I received an unforgettable impression of inhumanity and even positive malevolence.
 

Like Shooting Rabbits ...
Republic had just taken over the Corrigan-McKinney steel plant in Cleveland, and was “rationalizing” it – that is, firing about half the employees. In describing this operation, Girdler dwelt with evident pleasure on the hundreds of Corrigan-McKinney workers he had been able to eliminate. He told how he and four or five other top executives made a tour of the entire plant the day Republic took over, constituting themselves a sort of firing squad to “execute” on the spot the superfluous workers. “We’d see five or six men working around a blast furnace,” he reminisced pleasantly. “We’d go up to them and point out three or four – ‘You ... you ... you ... get your pay check. You’re through!’” This seemed to amuse him. With a grin he summed up what the episode had meant to him: “It was some slaughter! Like shooting rabbits sitting!”
 



IN A FEW WEEKS the Temporary National Economic Committee, popularly known as the Monopoly Committee, will celebrate its first birthday. Its work has had the personal approval of the President, who was given direct control of $400,000 of its $500,000 initial appropriation, and who recently let it be known he hoped Congress would grant the Committee the $2,000,000 more it will need to complete its work through 1940. I think it is worth devoting this month’s column to a consideration of just what this Committee, so impressively sponsored, so lavishly publicized, has done in its first year of existence.
Congress set up the Committee in response to a special message from President Roosevelt suggesting “a thorough study of the concentration of economic power in American industry and the effect of that concentration upon the decline of competition.” As further defined by Congress and by its own members, the Monopoly Committee’s scope takes in every aspect of our economic life, from employment and wage levels to holding companies and branch banking. Twelve men are on the Committee: two reactionaries and one New Dealer from the House; one reactionary (King of Utah) and two wobbly liberals (Borah of Idaho and O’Mahoney of Wyoming) from the Senate; and six representatives from various executive agencies, most notable being Thurman Arnold (Justice), W.O. Douglas and his alternate, Jerome Frank (SEC), Garland Ferguson (Federal Trade Commission), and Isidor Lubin (Labor). The Committee’s executive secretary is Leon Henderson, chief economist of WPA and one of the leading leftish intellectuals in the Administration. Altogether, the Committee rates remarkably high in brains, the low level of the congressional contingent being more than outweighed by the calibre of the delegates from the executive departments. (It will be understood that this judgement is not absolute, but on the scale of American bourgeois politics today.)
It was Secretary Henderson who best summed up the question which the twelve wise men are trying to answer: “Why have we not had full employment and full utilization of our magnificent resources?” From time to time in our history, other such committees have struggled with this question: the Trust Investigation of 1900, the Armstrong Committee of 1906, the Stanley Committee of 1911, the Pujo Money Trust Investigation of 1912, the Industrial Commission of 1916. Each of these tried to answer this simple question, and each failed, for the same reason the Monopoly Committee is failing, because each tried to work out a solution within the bounds of capitalism.
The Monopoly Committee, however, is failing in a different way from any of its predecessors. In their attacks on the monopoly octopus, all these committees have fought the battle not of the proletariat, but of the petty bourgeoisie, driven bankrupt by the onward march of the trusts, eternally exploited and hornswoggled as an investor by the big bourgeoisie who pull the strings of the system. The older committees, in an era when the basic stability of American capitalism was not questioned, lustily attacked the enemy, exposing vast quantities of dirty linen and even extorting a few minor concessions. But by now it is clear that our capitalism as a whole is none too secure, and that minor reforms will not be enough. A slashing onslaught in the old trust-busting style might be more than the rickety old structure could stand—and so the Monopoly Committee adopts a tone of sympathy rather than of indignation toward the monopolists it questions. When capitalism is really sick, the petty bourgeoisie shows its basic class solidarity with the big bourgeoisie. If the Monopoly Committee has not yet gone very far beneath the surface and shows no signs of wanting to do so, it is not for lack of brains or money. It is simply that it doesn’t dare to.
 
“Our Interests Are Really the Same”
From the moment of its creation, the Monopoly Committee began assuring the business community that its intentions were of the friendliest. “This is not a punitive expedition,” Chairman O’Mahoney kept repeating. “I don’t believe in centralized planning.” By the end of August, the American Bar Association, the US Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manufacturers had all offered their “cooperation” to the Committee. (The NAM, indeed, carried cooperation so far as to announce that it was spending $50,000 of its good money on a patent study which it hoped would “aid” the Committee.) Until the hearings began, many in both the right and the left camps maintained that all this talk of “cooperation” was a ruse de guerre, that once the Trojan Horse was inside the citadel of monopoly, from its belly would come pouring forth an army of trustbusters thirsting for Wall Street blood. But now the Wooden Horse is inside the walls of Troy, and from it have issued not Greeks but—more Trojans. General Johnson, one of the most clamorous Cassandras of the right, recently admitted he had entertained unjust suspicions of the committee, that it really was “cooperating” in splendid fashion. And Arthur Krock, the NY Times’ bitterly conservative political editor, a few weeks ago expressed the hope that
“Senator O’Mahoney will keep it as thoughtful and restrained as he has thus far—or postpone it indefinitely if the crackpots and political maneuverers break their leashes ...”
But no one on the Committee particularly wants to break his leash. As Chairman O’Mahoney remarked, speaking of their attitude toward the industrialists and bankers who testify before them:
“We of the Committee might just as well be sitting on the other side of the table. Our interests are really the same.”
You could hardly ask for anything plainer than that.
After seven months of preparation and false starts, the Committee began its hearings with a series of lectures by economists armed with charts and pointers. These were so dull as to clear out half the spectators the very first day. There was nothing new in the data presented, but it is worth setting down a few of the major items. The Committee learned that the total loss in national income since 1929 is $293,000,000,000 or seven times the present national debt; that wages in 1929 were $63,000,000,000, dividends $16,000,000,000, as against 1938 totals of $54,000,000,000 for wages and $15,000,000,000 for dividends; that 54% of the nation’s families have incomes of less than $1200 a year; that even if production climbed back to 1929 levels, there would still be 7,000,000 unemployed; that the total loss of working time in the last nine years comes to one year and two months per worker.
 
Love Feast
After three days of charts and pointers, the Committee got down to business. It took up first the burning issue of—patents. The automobile barons were summoned to the stand to tell a beamingly sympathetic Committee (and, through the press, the rest of the American people) how enlightened their patent policies are. Edsel Ford said his father’s company swapped patents with other companies. “Fine!” said the Committee. President Macauley of Packard said that his company paid and collected royalties. “Bully!” said the Committee. The manager of the Automobile Manufacturers Association, to which everybody except Ford and Packard belong, said that the members pooled their patents. “Splendid!” cried the Committee. The AMA manager noted also that this pooling arrangement applied only to patents taken out before 1930, because the companies naturally wanted to cash in on their new gadgets before letting society, and their competitors, have the benefit of them. This bit of vulgar economic self-seeking the Committee passed over in delicate silence. They were plainly interested in the more idealistic aspects of the automobile business. They had a particularly good time spinning technocratic dreams with the genial Charles F. Kettering, chief engineer for General Motors, who put on for them his Homespun Inventor act.
“If we could only have an inventions congress here,” sighed Mr. Kettering, “in which we had business men and economists and representatives of government and could sit down and say, ‘Now what are the most probable things that we can do?’”
“So far as I am concerned,” warmly responded Chairman O’Mahoney, “the principal purpose of these hearings is to provide a forum for just such a conference with respect to our national economy. And may I say to you, Mr. Kettering, that I feel very much stimulated by your testimony this afternoon?”
No wonder the trade magazine, Steel, commented on “last week’s love feast of automobile executives with the Monopoly Committee in Washington.” Steel also reported that when Edsel Ford showed annoyance at the continual popping of photographers’ flashbulbs, one of the Senators on the Committee admonished him: “This helps to sell automobiles as well as politicians, you know.”
 
Empire in Glass
For its horrible example of a “bad” use of patents, the Committee was careful to pick a comparatively small industry, and even so to pull its punches. But the general effect was gruesome enough, all the same—and the one piece of good old-fashioned muckraking the Committee has allowed itself to date. It seems that a company no one has ever heard of, the Hartford-Empire Co. of Hartford, Conn., owns the patents on the machinery which last year produced 67% of the nation’s glass containers, including most of our fruit jars and almost all our milk bottles. It is a very nice business, indeed. Throughout the depression, Hartford-Empire’s revenues rose steadily year by year, touching 48% on invested capital in 1936 and 68% in 1937. What did it do to reap this rich reward from society? It does nothing so obvious as make bottles. It doesn’t even make the machines that make the bottles. It merely controls the patents without which no one can make these machines—and, consequently, no one can make milk bottles. It pays another company to make to its order these machines, which it then rents to such bottle makers as it thinks advisable. By never selling its machines, Hartford-Empire keeps complete control of the whole process in its own hands.
The Hartford patents are on the “gob” process. The only other important process, the “suction” method, is controlled by the big Owens-Illinois Glass Co. Last year, 29% of the nation’s glass containers were made either by Owens or by companies licensed by it, leaving just 4% of the industry for the “independents”. Hartford and Owens work amicably together, united by various contracts. Corning Glass, the other big glass company, controls Hartford-Empire through a series of intervening companies. As President Levis of Owens remarked to the Committee: “Everybody in the glass business is pretty friendly.” Everybody on the inside, that is. What happens to brash outsiders who try to buck Hartford’s patent empire was told in detail to the Committee. As was the long tale of Hartford’s suppression of such advances in the art of glassmaking as do not seem to be to its commercial advantage.
“In some cases,” concluded Chairman O’Mahoney cautiously, “the evidence seems to indicate that the original intention of the patent grant as stated in the Constitution to promote the progress of science and the useful arts, has been obscured.”
 
Patents—and Publicity
The automobile industry was not the only one to cash in on the excellent sounding-board offered by the Committee’s hearings. A Mr. Farnsworth who has a radio and television company told the Committee in detail how he had discovered the basic principles of television at the age of fourteen. A Mr. Baekland, inventor and promoter of the plastic, Bakelite, was induced to admit, also in detail, that Bakelite would be ideal for certain airplane parts now made of inferior materials. Dr. Coolidge, director of General Electric’s research laboratories, proclaimed the virtues of his firm’s “Invisible Glass” (with samples for the Committee members). The Capital wits began to say that if the Committee couldn’t get a further appropriation from Congress, it might finance itself by charging business men so much an hour for the use of its witness stand.
Except for the job on Hartford-Empire, such muckraking as the Committee did in the patent field was purely involuntary and accidental. It was quite by chance, for instance, that Dr. Jewett, head of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, happened to mention a vacuum radio tube which lasts 50,000 hours, as against the 1,000-hour life of the tubes now sold for use in home receiving sets. His laboratories invented this in 1923, and the parent company, American Telephone and Telegraph, has been using it in its business ever since. Although Dr. Jewett said this tube could be adapted to use in home sets, it has never been put on the market. Neither Western Electric, a subsidiary of AT&T, nor RCA, nor General Electric—who have cross-licensing agreements on patents with AT&T—have shown any interest in giving the public this 50-times better tube. (Mr. Lubin of the Committee said he was “terribly upset about this long life tube”.) When some one asked Dr. Jewett why these great companies had not put the tube on the market, he replied bluntly: “It isn’t commercially to their advantage to do it.”
  
Life Insurance Gets Another Whirl
The liberal-reformists gallop off to their crusades on the most dashing chargers, to the accompaniment of martial airs. But closer inspection reveals that the hoofs of their spirited steeds are firmly anchored, that the exhilirating motion is due to the revolving of the merry-go-round, while the humble source of the thrilling music is the steam calliope in the center. By this time, the reformers have covered a good deal of territory, always, of course, in a circular motion. The same problems, the same “solutions” crop up decade after decade, as the merry-go-round completes its appointed rounds. But if the law of motion of reformism is circular, that of capitalist accumulation leads in all too straight a line to monopoly, state capitalism, and fascism. The reformists are grappling today with the same monsters they failed to slay thirty years ago, but, while the dragon-slayers are no bigger, the dragons have grown in the interim to really terrifying proportions.
Which is a somewhat ponderous prelude to the investigation of life insurance companies which the SEC is conducting for the Monopoly Committee. Because of the appalling size of the major companies, and because 64,000,000 Americans hold some sort of life insurance policy, this is the key study of them all. But the repetitive nature of these things is already apparent. The classic insurance investigation, the one on which the SEC inquiry is frankly modelled, was that conducted by Charles Evans Hughes in 1905-6 for the Armstrong Committee of the New York State Legislature. The Armstrong Committee uncovered a remarkable amount of dirt—there was a remarkable amount there—and stimulated some drastic changes in the control and business methods of the great insurance companies. The committee reached two major conclusions: (1) insurance companies in 1906 were too big and wielded too great financial power for the good of the nation; (2) this power was autocratically used by a small group of insiders to advance their own interests, without any control either by their policy-holders or by society in general. Thirty years later, the SEC is making precisely the same discoveries about the insurance business, only on a larger scale.
In 1906 there were 136 legal reserve companies, with $2,900,000,000 in assets. Today there are 308, with $26,250,000,000. In 1906 the three biggest companies had half a billion assets apiece. Today, New York Life has $2,500,000,000; Prudential has $3,500,000,000; and Metropolitan, which had $176,000,000 in 1906, has amassed the incredible total of $5,000,000,000. (Every day of the year, including Sundays, Metropolitan finds itself with $2,000,000 it must invest.) At the end of last year, 49 of the biggest insurance companies owned 23% of all railroad bonds, 15% of all industrial bonds, 14% of all city mortgages. Last year the ten biggest companies alone bought 55% of all corporate bonds and notes issued. “No useful purpose,” the Armstrong Committee noted of the insurance companies, “will be served by their becoming larger.”
After the Armstrong investigation, many big companies went “mutual”, that is, they reorganized themselves so that their policyholders were also their owners. But this has turned out to be mere eyewash. Control is still gripped tightly by a small inner circle of financiers. The SEC finds that in recent years, in the twelve biggest mutual companies, the percentage of policyholders who even bother to vote for “their” trustees in elections runs from 0.01 to 2.51. There is no case on record of an “independent” (of the management) candidate being elected in a major company, and only five cases on record since 1906 of an independent candidate even being proposed. The Metropolitan had an especially high percentage of ballots cast in its elections. A dozen Metropolitan agents told the Committee that it was common practice for them to write in signatures on ballots themselves without bothering the policyholders.
As for the business conduct of the “trustees”—ironical term—the SEC already has found much the sort of evidence the Armstrong Committee uncovered. Al Smith used his trusteeship in NY Life to extort fuel oil orders for his Meenan Oil Co.; Mutual Life’s deposit at Bankers Trust jumped from $150,000 to $1,500,000 when President Colt of Bankers Trust went on its board; Guaranty Trust rejoices in five Mutual Life directors, and also in $23,400,000 of Mutual money on deposit; etc., etc.
The insurance hearings have been adjourned until the SEC completes its survey. The ineffable Chairman O’Mahoney hastened to do his usual whitewashing job: “Nothing whatever was developed at the hearings to reflect upon the integrity or the ability of the men who administer these huge organizations.” Whitewashing is still fairly easy; the surface has hardly been scratched.
 
Douglas Gets His Brass Ring
The chances that the SEC will dig really deep into the life insurance situation have probably been lessened by the “elevation” (read: sterilization) of its chairman to the Supreme Court. For Douglas is courageous, honest, and energetic—insofar as those qualities are consistent with a reformist philosophy. Much too bold and energetic, indeed, for both Wall Street and the White House in this era of appeasement. It goes without saying that Douglas accepted the nomination at once. This is another aspect of the reformist merry-go-round. The crusaders who ride its painted steeds, every now and then capture a brass ring which entitles them, not to another ride as in most merry-go-rounds, but quite the contrary—to dismount from their warhorses and take it easy in some comfortable berth of extreme honor. Thus Douglas takes the seat of Brandeis, who, thirty years before him, also viewed with articulate alarm the insurance monster — until he presently got his brass ring and retired to the Supreme Court. And the fiery prosecutor of the Armstrong Committee, whose bristling red whiskers used to strike terror to the most insolent insurance mogul, has long since found his berth as chief justice of the same august tribunal.
There is another sort of brass ring, less dignified and secure but more rewarding in other ways, which the riders on the reformist merry-go-round often snatch off. This is a job with one of the wicked corporations the crusader has been tilting against. A curious example of this sort of thing came to light during the Monopoly Committee’s hearings on the Hartford-Empire patent racket. The Committee’s counsel produced an extremely damaging memorandum from the company’s files, which bluntly announced its “three main purposes in securing patents” to be:

to prevent duplication of our machines;
to block the development of other machines; and
to get patents on all possible improvements of competing machines so as to prevent their reaching an improved stage.

The author of this memorandum was a certain Herbert Knox Smith, who was secretary and chief counsel for the company until his death in 1931. Mr. Smith had also been Commissioner of Corporations under Theodore Roosevelt, and as such had supervised a still celebrated series of reports on the tobacco trust, the meat trust, the steel trust, and so on. Apparently, he had learned so much about monopolistic methods while he was fighting the trusts that he was practically invaluable, in his later years, to a company like Hartford-Empire.
 
Hobson’s Choice
The Committee, of course, is split between its reactionary and its progressive wings. But this split is not very serious because the progressives are both more numerous and more articulate than the reactionaries. The really significant division, which is largely responsible for the inconclusive fumbling of the Committee to date, has appeared in recent weeks as the Federal Trade Commission has been taking over the witness stand. It soon became obvious that the progressives are deeply split among themselves. The FTC leads the old-fashioned trust-busters, who take the classic anti-monopoly position: enforce the anti-trust laws and restore free competition. The New Deal brain-trusters—Douglas, Frank, Henderson, Lubin, Arnold—are all for regulation rather than trust-busting. They seem to be working towards some sort of revived NRA, which would permit business to “organize” itself, subject to state control, exercised through commissions composed of representatives of business, labor, consumers, and the government. Already, Thurman Arnold and his chief, Attorney General Murphy, are reported to have worked out some such scheme for enforcing the anti-trust laws.
It must be granted that the neo-NRA advocates are more brilliant and sophisticated than their opponents.
They are more aware of the post-war changes in American capitalism, and the inevitable direction of its development. They hope, of course, to be able to confine the drive of monopoly capitalism safely within the bounds of reformism. But objectively, their proposals would make it easier for monopoly capitalism to take over complete and direct state power and install fascism. Sincere anti-fascists though they are—now — their program represents the slow swing of the middle classes behind big business in time of capitalist crisis and decay. It is the program of the White House and “business appeasement”. And so it is not surprising that the FTC finds itself pretty much isolated on the Monopoly Committee. It, too, is fighting the battle of the petty bourgeoisie, but from a position which is by now definitely of the past. The fight was lost when America came out of the World War the most powerful monopoly capitalist state in the world.
But the FTC is effective on the Committee far beyond the support its program gets. For one thing, it has had twenty-five years of experience in trying to regulate business, and it knows a great deal more about business than any of the brain-trusters do. For a large part of its raw material, the Committee is dependent on the FTC And since the FTC’s view of American business is realistic, and even cynical, the Committee finds itself constantly confronted with data which proves just what it doesn’t want to prove. Furthermore, the FTC, in its stodgy way, is able to poke holes in the thesis of the brain-trusters without much difficulty. Its officials refer to the NRA as an example of what happens when business is given self-regulatory powers. And they are constantly making such remarks as:
“The abandonment of free capitalism here as in other nations will require the abandonment of democracy.”
Or:
“Monopoly constitutes the death of capitalism and the genesis of authoritarian government.”
The Frank-Henderson-Arnold wing is equally effective in rebuttal. They have little difficulty showing that a return to pure competition would be impossible, and, even if possible, socially undesirable because of the nature of many industries. They can point to a long record of futility and impotence in trust-busting. The first great period of trust-forming began in 1898, eight years after the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was passed. The second big era of industrial combination began in 1922, eight years after the Clayton Act was passed and the FTC was created.
The fact is that the middle classes, for which both wings of the Committee speak, are confronted by Hobson’s choice. They can either struggle against monopoly capitalism—and ultimate fascism—with the antiquated and ineffective weapons offered them by the FTC. Or they can follow along after the President and his brain-trusters, whose program of regulation and “appeasement” is practical and effective today precisely because tomorrow it will offer the least resistance to fascism. The only hope of the middle classes lies in a program, the revolutionary struggle for socialism, which the Monopoly Committee cannot be expected to take into account. Without that alternative, the choice confronting the middle classes, and their Monopoly Committee, is Hobsonian indeed.
 



The School for Dictators
by Ignazio Silone
Harpers. $2.50
In this book Silone has written his masterpiece – a political satire that can be mentioned in the same breath with Aristophanes, Swift, and Voltaire. Nothing, indeed, is too much to be said for the book, except what the jacket blurb does say: “A master of prose attacks with bare fists the most absorbing single problem of our day. ...” Silone uses almost every other weapon on fascism, from slapstick drollery to the most severely restrained irony, but his attack is effective precisely because it is not delivered with bare fists. His literary style is an admirable synthesis of the classic and conversational – dense but not heavy, closely wrought but always lucid. He is learned in political history and fertile of ideas, but he knows how to be easy and unpretentious about things, never parading his learning or insisting too much on his ideas. His book, in short, combines the virtues of good prose and good conversation.
Although the theme of The School for Dictators is modern politics, it will not do to seek from it any positive conclusions. Nor does his book tell us anything about politics we didn’t know already. In fact, it is often superficial and confused in its specifically political analysis. Its importance, like that of the earlier Bread and Wine, is that it applies a set of values – humane, honest, and intellectually sophisticated – to the political phenomena of today. To guard and cherish such a human norm, independent of political parties (though not of political tendencies), is a valuable function of the intellectual. I might add that the politicians of the left can gain from this book some excellent insights not only into the real nature of fascism but also into certain deficiencies of their own programs.
I have never been as much impressed by Silone’s novels as perhaps I should be. They have seemed to me to be episodic, even at times tainted with journalistic trickery – as in the abrupt “black-out” endings of certain chapters. The characters have often seemed one-dimensional and all too obviously designed to point the moral. In this book, however, these weaknesses become virtues. The stylization of the three principal persons in the dialogue is appropriate to the satirical intent, and the form is episodic as good conversation must be, one idea touching off another. I have been told, by the way, that Silone had planned to carry the dialogue much further, but was persuaded by his publishers to let this much appear now. If this is true, we may hope for another volume.
In another way, too, The School for Dictators seems to me an advance over the novels: in its subject matter. Fontamara had the qualities and the defects of a poster: it was an intellectual’s attempt to present, from above and outside, the most primitive sort of peasant life, simplifying its values towards a propagandist end. Bread and Wine opened up the focus, including the intellectual as well as the petty bourgeois and the peasant in its scope. Much the most interesting parts, to me, were the conversations between Don Benedetto and Don Paolo. These conversations have now expanded to become the body of the present book, a progression I find all for the best. Silone, after all, is an intellectual, a man of ideas, representing a high development of modern consciousness, and here he deals directly with the central themes of his intellectual experience. The easy play of his mind in this book is as natural as Fontamara, for all its effectiveness, was mannered. This raises the question why so few of the “creative” writers of today occupy themselves with politics as a theme. (Brecht’s novel, A Penny for the Poor, is another, though less successful, attempt to treat such subject matter.) There seems to be a blight on the novel and the short story today. I suggest this is partly because politics has come to occupy so much of our consciousness that what for so many generations has been called “creative” writing has come to seem tangential to the central issues. And I suggest that the political themes which preoccupied Dryden, Pope, Swift, Voltaire and the other great eighteenth century writers may once more regain their supremacy in this century, whose intellectual atmosphere is in many ways similar. The School for Dictators may prove to be a seminal work in this respect.
 




In discussing Guerin’s book in this column two weeks ago, I made some remarks on an article in Harper’s by Gunther Reimann, Doing Business in Germany. This article seemed to me to be trying to prove the well-worn thesis of bourgeois journalism: the business man as well as the workers gets it in the neck under Hitler. Mr. Reimann, however, writes in and protests that I “misunderstood and misinterpreted” his article.
“In general, you indicate that I do not think fascism is a class phenomenon,” he writes. “I want to state that I regard fascism as the deepest stage of capitalist decay and a class phenomenon, and that I did not say anything contrary to this opinion in that article. The decay of capitalism produces new features which have to be studied and one of these features is the destruction of the sanctity of private property and private property rights by fascism.”
I am glad Mr. Reimann is not deceived as to the nature of fascism, and I agree that its violation of private property rights is something worth much attention. But I must still maintain that an article devoted only to this point and printed in a magazine like Harper’s gives the reader who is not familiar with Mr. Reimann’s political stand in general (as I was not) the impression that he is trying to demonstrate the anti-capitalist nature of fascism. Especially when its concluding sentence is: “To Germany’s business men, harassed by the Party, dogged by State Commissars at every move, insecure, worried about present and future, the Nazi ‘economists’ can only toss the slogan ‘Live Dangerously!’”
I am glad to be able to clear up Mr. Reimann’s position on fascism. I only wish he had made it equally clear in the pages of Harper’s.
 

France and the Refugees
The best news account I have read on one of the most shocking and scandalous horror stories of all time, is the recent story in Time on France’s treatment of the 450,000 Spanish refugees who fled over the Catalan border a month ago. After pointing out that the United States has offered to take in just 352 of the 450,000 and the Soviet Union has opened its gates to “only a few big Loyalist leaders” – the story gets down to the meat – and very maggoty meat it is, too. I think the details are worth quoting:
“Stuck with the refugees, French authorities adopted methods calculated to help ‘persuade’ them that they would be better off almost anywhere else. Typical rations were one loaf of bread for six men, a sack of rice for 400 men. Sanitation has been non-existent. Open latrines have been dug in the camp sand and all modesty about nature’s functions has long ago disappeared.
“The largest camps are situated on a treeless sandy beach just North of the Spanish border near Argeles-sur-Mer and St. Cyprien. They are enclosed by barbed wire, guarded every 20 feet by a Senegalese soldier. Inside the wire the camp’s are like some fantastically huge hobo jungle. Only a few refugees have roofs over their heads; the great majority dig holes in the sand and cover themselves with dirty sheets, blankets or coats. Many sleep in the open, rain or shine. Icy sea winds blow the sands continually. Most of the refugees have developed conjunctivitis. Fuel in the large camps is scarce. Cooking is done exclusively in tin cans. At one camp men and women at first stood in line all day waiting to get a little water from a small faucet. At another the only water available – and it is brackish – is obtained from pumps driven into the sand. All the water is bad and it is estimated that 60% of the refugees – or 250,000 – have dysentery.
“The refugees have been classified as 220,000 militiamen, 40,000 able-bodied civilian men, 10,000 wounded, 180,000 women and children. Hospital facilities are limited and primitive. Many men with weeks-old wounds covered by filthy dressings are still unattended ... The refugees have become a danger to the general health of adjacent communities ... Marseilles gangsters, always in need of women for the white-slave traffic which supplies Africa and South American countries with prostitutes, were reported circulating in the camps looking for new personnel.”
Time adds (1) “Although amply warned of the huge human tide approaching, the French Government made few advance arrangements to receive the refugees.” (2) “The chances are that France in the end will not be out one sou. The daily $185,000 bill can be met for a long time by expropriating the treasures the Loyalists deposited and shipped to France months ago.”
 

R.S.V.P.
But let it not be thought the refugees huddled in their holes on the beaches of St. Cyprien are altogether friendless. The North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy still exists, and the other day I received tangible proof of this: a large formal invitation, in the most elegant type faces, requesting the pleasure of my company at a dinner at the Hotel Commodore “to welcome Vincent Sheean, who has just returned from Spain.” A battery of “Distinguished Foreign Correspondents and Writers,” including Dorothy Parker, would lead a discussion on “THE SPANISH CONFLICT AND ITS INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE.” The roster of Patrons and Patronesses took four impressive columns. Let the refugees take heart! They have some very high-class friends – so powerful and respectable, indeed, that it seems hardly possible, with such support, that the Spanish Republic is now at its last gasp. But let the refugees not be downcast so long as their cause is the cause of Mr. Franklin P. Adams and Miss Ilka Chase and Mr. Malcolm Cowley and Mrs. Muriel Draper and the Hon. and Mrs. Stanley M. Isaacs and Mr. Rockwell Kent and Miss Freda Kirchwey and Mr. and Mrs. Henry Goddard Leach and Dr. Max Lerner and Bishop Francis J. McConnell and Dr. Thomas Mann and Mr. Frederick March and Col. William Jay Schieffelin and Miss Sylvia Sidney and Mr. George Soule and Mr. Franchot Tone and Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard. “R.S.V.P.” read the invitation but I didn’t.
 




Where Is Walter Duranty?
Those who have been struggling with Walter Duranty’s recent dispatches in the N.Y. Times are beginning to ask themselves where these remarkable productions are coming from. Myself, I should not be surprised if Walter is writing from a small room in the Bronx, with a bottle of whiskey within easy reach. Certainly, there is no need for him to be in Moscow to turn out these garrulous and banal “think pieces” on what he conceives to be the state of mind of the 170,000,000 inhabitants of the Soviet Union. The density of facts per agate line, never very high in Duranty’s stuff these days, is now the thinnest in journalistic history. This sort of reporting used to come from Riga, in the days before the Soviets became respectable. But the Bronx would do just as well.
 

Social Justice, à la Scab
In the New Leader for March 11 a bit of information appeared which should be useful to all who come up against Coughlinites in the trade union movement. I give it in full:
“DETROIT – Father Coughlin’s Social Justice, anti-Semitic, anti-labor publication of the fascist priest, has been put on the unfair list by the Michigan Federation of Labor because it is printed in a scab shop.”
 

Spontaneity Again
Comrade John Travis Writes in from Lynn, Mass., to clarify the question of spontaneity in revolutionary tactics, which was raised by a Luxemburgite in this column several weeks ago. I quote part of his interesting letter:
“Real social revolutionary action may involve spontaneous over-boiling of the masses. Nevertheless, the revolutionary vanguard that will lead the social revolution (we hope) will have 1ong been preparing for just such an explosion of the masses. They will at that time strive to direct the angry explosions of the masses into a powerful and effective revolutionary attack upon the class enemy and the capitalist system. Thus real social revolutionary action involves both spontaneity and preparation: the spontaneous explosion of the masses brought into control, and led by a revolutionary vanguard with a prepared revolutionary program, strategy and tactic.”

Mr. Mumford Sees the Light
The N.Y. Times had occasion recently to rebuke the Hollywood producers, of all people, for lack of patriotism. The Times pointed out indignantly that in such recent films as Jesse James and Stagecoach, the “bad men” of Western history are shown to have been Robin
Hoods waging heroic war against the wicked bankers and land-grabbing railroad builders.
“The thing makes good melodrama,” conceded the Times, “but it is not very effective propaganda for democracy. If the American people today are to have their hearts set aglow for Americanism and the American Way, it does not help matters to show that America’s great West was built up by pirates and assassins operating under railway charters from the government.”
The Times then devotes several lengthy paragraphs, which I omit, to demonstrating that the railroad builders were not pirates and assassins because where would we be without railroads?
“Democracy and Americanism,” it concludes, “have won many new converts in recent years, one might almost say recent months. But not all of them have succeeded in ridding themselves of old ideas and old phrases from the time when they were much less certain about the virtues of American democracy ... much more consistent is a writer like Lewis Mumford. Having rallied to the cause of democracy against the fascist menace, Mr. Mumford has the courage to discard the doctrine that America was taken into the World War by the Morgans and the munitions makers. Mr. Mumford now calls this version a fable.”
The Times doesn’t have the face to add the courageous Mr. Mumford’s final conclusion on the last War: “What was wrong was not that we sought to preserve democracy; what alone was wrong was that we failed.”
Time was when intellectuals like Mumford were applying their talents to debunking American history. But when New Republic liberals go star-spangled, they do a thorough job of it. It is to Hollywood, apparently, that in future we must look for a realistic interpretation of our national past.
 

Add: Defense of Reimann
Last week I printed Gunther Reimann’s protest that I had misinterpreted his article, Doing Business in Nazi Germany. And now Peter Tor writes in, also to protest that
“Reimann is not unaware of the intimate relationship between the Nazi bureaucracy and the capitalist class ... His bitter attack, a few months ago, on the People’s Front as a method of fighting fascism is an indication of his opinion ... On the whole, his book, Germany: World Empire or World Revolution, is not only one of the most stimulating analyses of Nazism, but one that can take its place beside Guerin’s, as a worthy addition to a revolutionist’s library.”
 




That’s Where the Money Goes
They say the United States is a great democracy because our industries are owned by millions of small stockholders, because the American Standard of Living is higher than anywhere else in the world. But the Bureau of Internal Revenue reports that in 1933 only 1,750,000 of the 120,000,000 citizens of this land had incomes high enough to be taxed. And even among these topmost 1,750,000, there was a striking concentration of wealth. Thus of those filing income tax returns in the highly prosperous year 1929, a tiny group of 3.28% got over 83% of all dividends paid out to individual stockholders. Or, to put it slightly differently, 0.3 of 1% of the population received 78% of all dividends paid that year.
What does this tight little oligarchy do with the lion’s share of our national income it receives? A recent issue of Town and Country, an expensive smart-set journal, gives us the answers, as compiled from a questionnaire sent out to several hundred butlers in New York City. Practically all their; employers, replied the butlers, have both town and country houses, the former averaging 18 rooms, the latter 22 rooms. (One family of five had a 44-room house, with 40 servants, or eight to each member of the family.) In the winter, each family entertained an average of 138 guests a month, and in the gay summer season, this rose to 181 guests a month. To keep host and guests happy took an average of 2,400 bottles of various beverages per family in the course of a year, including 242 bottles of Scotch whisky and 115 bottles of champagne. When it all became too utterly boring, the family went off to Bermuda, to the Riviera, to the South Seas – an average of two and one-half trips per year, each time with seven trunks. Town and Country failed to point out that if the 0.3 of 1% of the population whose butlers it queried could only raise the 78% of the national dividends they now get to a reasonable figure – say 9.0% – they could increase their consumption of whisky to 300 or 400 bottles a year and could afford to take four or five trips per year, with, say, ten trunks instead of a measly seven. The New Deal’s tax experts are now working on the problem.
 

Add: Walter Duranty
A friend sends in a quotation from Martha Dodd’s Through Embassy Eyes which to some extent confirms the hypothesis I advanced last week as to Mr. Duranty’s whereabouts – only the room is in Moscow, not the Bronx. Considering the ardent Stalinist sympathies of Miss Dodd, her testimony is rather damaging.
“When the Moscow trials were beginning,” she writes, “one rather venomous journalist said that Walter never appeared at the sessions, that he sat at home and wrote his news from what he knew would happen and from the information he might have gotten from other sources, while the others sweated every day and far into the night to report the courtroom drama. I faced Walter with these charges, and he admitted them to some degree. He said that he attended sessions regularly but that he did not spend every minute of the day, when they were going on, in the courtroom. He knew all the people involved, most of them personally and over a long period of time, he knew their past records, and he knew the charges against them. It was ridiculous for him to be as attentive as the rest of the correspondents.”
 

Footnote to Fortune
In the February, 1938, issue of Fortune there was a long and laudatory story on Celotex Corporation, which makes roofing, wallboard, insulating materials, etc. It was a very fine, up-and-coming enterprise indeed, one gathered, and it was run by a couple of supermen named Bror Dahlberg and Wallace Groves. “Both of them,” burbled Fortune, “are men with large ideas, and both like to take chances.” There was, it is true, a very delicate hint in passing that superman Groves “is a source of suspicion and concern to the Securities & Exchange Commission.” But the general impression was that two such splendid specimens of American business manhood as Messrs. Groves and Dahlberg had not been discovered since Fortune’s last corporation article.
This may well be true. But a few weeks after Fortune’s article appeared, its hero, Wallace Groves, was indicted in federal court on fifteen counts of conspiracy and mail fraud. If the case goes against him, as it seems likely it will, he will face a maximum sentence of seventy-two years. Apparently, he took one chance too many.
Fortune’s misstep is understandable. Wallace Groves, like the late J. Donald Coster, is no fly-by-night confidence man. He is one of the big shots in Wall Street, organizer – together with the eminently respectable Walter Mack, Jr. – of the $6,700,000 Phoenix Securities Corp., which controls such nationally known enterprises as Celotex Loft Candy Stores, and United Cigar-Whelan Stores Corp. If such demigods as these turn out to have feet of clay, where will Fortune turn for material?
 

Right Out of the Horse’s Mouth
“As president of the American Federation of Teachers for the past three years, I can say, with complete assurance that the charges of ‘communist control’ are untrue.” – Jerome Davis, in a recent New Republic. This explicit statement by President Davis, whose long struggle against Stalinism is well known, should set at rest those malicious rumors we have been hearing lately about the teacher’s union. They were evidently the inventions of Trotskyist-Bukharinist-Gestapo elements within the organization.
 




The Things They Don’t Talk About
Already we are getting a pre-view of what is in store for the labor movement in the next war. They don’t talk about these things much in political speeches, they don’t print much about them in the papers, and so you very probably don’t even know they are happening. You might think, for instance, that an army fighting for democracy would accept Negroes on equal terms with whites. You might think that when a nation goes off on a holy war for democracy, the rights of its workers at home would be scrupulously guarded. You might think that, in such an idealistic enterprise, business men would not be allowed to make money out of their fellow citizens’ blood. But what happened last week in Congress when the Army Air Corps Expansion bill was passed shows that you would be wrong on all three counts. To itemize:

The bill originally provided that at least one Army air school should train Negro pilots. “Much distressed,” reports Time, “the Air Corps quietly went to work on Capitol Hill to get Negro training killed ...”
 
The bill originally forbade the award of contracts for Army planes to all firms which had been convicted of violating the Wagner Act. The C.I.O. and the A.F.L. had joined forces to get this provision inserted. But as the bill was going through its final stages, the War Department “emphatically demanded” that this protection for labor be removed from the bill. It was.
 
There is a lot of talk in Congress about “taking the profits out of war.” Just what the honorable Congressmen mean was clearly enough shown when the Air Corps bill “limited” profits on all Army contracts to ... 12%!

Those idealistic liberals who want us to act as policeman for the world seem to be forgetting – as they did in 1917 – that to fight a war, whether for democracy or not, you must turn the nation over to those experts in death: the munitions makers and the War Department. The next war will be a crusade for democracy – somewhere else.
 

Tom Girdler, Dove of Peace
“The steel industry abhors war and fervently hopes for peace,” Tom Girdler, of Republic Steel Corp. and the Memorial Day Massacre, recently told a gathering of mining engineers. “The impression prevails,” he said sadly, “that the steel industry looks eagerly at profits from war. That is not true. War brings no genuine prosperity to the steel industry.”
It would be interesting to get Girdler’s definition of “genuine prosperity.” In 1917 Bethlehem Steel earned $54,000,000 and in 1918, $57,000,000. U.S. Steel earned $333,000,000 in 1916 and $530,000,000 in 1917, declaring in the latter year an extra dividend of 18%, Coming down to the present, I see by the papers that the Navy Department has signed contracts for $24,000,000 worth of armor plate with three steel companies – this being merely one of many such contracts involved in our current preparations to save the world again as we did so nobly in 1917.
In a certain sense, however, it is true that the steel barons don’t want war.
“We have seen the effects of war,” said Tom Girdler, “as written in the social, economic and political upheavals since 1918. These stresses and strains have brought civilization near the cracking point. Another world war might well result in the complete’ collapse of civilization.”
Neither Tom Girdler nor any other responsible member of the ruling class wants war now if it can be avoided in any possible way – short of giving up their profits, that is. As any one who has seen his gun thugs in action knows, Tom Girdler is no humanitarian. When he expresses fears lest the next war may mean “the complete collapse of civilization,” he really means “the complete collapse of capitalism?”
This is what is behind the concessions made by Chamberlain and Daladier to Hitler at the Munich Conference last fall. To quote the London correspondent of the N.Y. Times:
“The real motive of ‘appeasement’ is the fear of a war that might crack the political, economic and social structure of this country beyond repair, whether Britain won the war or not. Mr. Chamberlain and his colleagues feel sure that the British Empire could survive a war with Germany at the cost of untold human misery, but they are not so sure that the men and the system that have ruled the country for so many years would still be ruling it when the war was over.”
Moral: the more militancy the workers show, the less chances of a war.
 

Business Is Business
Business men overwhelmingly approve of President Roosevelt’s imperialistic foreign policy; and/but you don’t find them passing up any chances for profits. If a dictatorship wants munitions and can lay cash on the line, it gets them – and from the same business interests as support so enthusiastically the New Deal’s war drive to save “democracy.” Thus, the Department of Commerce has announced that the biggest foreign purchaser of American steel ingots and scrap iron in January of this year was Japan. In 1937 Italy got 63 per cent of its scrap iron imports from this country. Last year the United States supplied 68 per cent of Italy’s scrap imports.
Not long ago, a friend who had just returned from Pittsburgh told me of an interesting married couple there. The husband was president of a big firm of scrap iron dealers, and his best customer was the Japanese government. His wife was a leader in the Stalinist stooge outfit, the League for Peace and Democracy, and at the time was especially active in getting the women of Pittsburgh to boycott stockings made of Japanese silk.
 



To the Socialist Appeal:
I send you herewith a copy of a letter that I sent to the Workers Age, organ of the Independent Labor League (Lovestone-ites).
Sir:
In a recent issue of Workers Age it was announced that I am to be among the speakers in a series of lectures to be given at the Independent Labor Institute. To keep the record straight, I’d like to state that actually I had told the Institute several weeks before that I could not give a talk there, for various reasons. Apparently, there was some sort of misunderstanding.



 


Sincerely,
Dwight Macdonald



 



“THE EMPLOYMENT given by armament programs is false employment. It builds no permanent structure and creates no consumers goods for the maintenance of a lasting prosperity.

Roosevelt in Buenos Ayres. Date: 1936.

The Strange Case of Dr. Coster, or the Mystery of the Crude Drug Department, has now been presented in rich detail – which it certainly deserves – in the press. The story of how a convicted swindler and stool pigeon changed his name and became one of the big men of Wall Street, president of the respectable old $80,000,000 McKesson & Robbins drug house – this could hardly be improved on outside a novel. Indeed, it suggests, in its wild mixture of larceny, big business, and bourgeois respectability Bert Brecht’s satirical novel, A Penny for the Poor, which has just been published in this country. The press, of course, pretended that the Coster was something almost without precedent: the NY Times struck just the right note in its editorial attributing actual “genius” to Coster and implying that only such a superman could have gotten away with it on such a scale. But the Coster case was remarkable only in its details; capitalism, especially in its decline, breeds grand larcenies like maggots. Coster was smeared over the front page, but any one who had taken the trouble to follow last month’s financial pages – where the Coster affair, too, made its first modest appearances – could have compiled a dossier of business corruption:

Item: The SEC took action against Transamerica Corp., key holding company of the huge Bank of America system in California. The charges ranged from “creation of fictitious reserves” to a claim that the salary of President A.P. Giannini is not $1, as stated by the company, but $7,000,000 a year. The seriousness of this action is increased by the fact that Giannini is the only big banker who has been friendly to the New Deal from the first.
 
Item: A rising young investment banker named Wallace Groves was indicted for mail fraud. Mr. Groves had put together half a dozen investment trusts, bought control of United Cigar Stores and Celotex Corp., and acquired a yacht, an island in the Bahamas, and a movie actress for wife. Mr. Grove and his associates face possible prison terms of 72 years apiece.
 
Item: The SEC sought a Federal injunction against the Fidelity Investment Company, charging its officers were scheming to defraud 60,000 investors who hold $276,200,000 of its certificates. The Association’s president is a former Treasurer of the US, its chairman a former assistant attorney general of the US, and its directors include ex-Senators, ex-Governors, and directors of well-known corporations.
 
Item: The $1,000,000,000 Associated Gas & Electric Co., whose financial structure, for good reasons, is so complex that it is said only one man, the devious H.C. Hopson, can understand it, was up in two courts at the same time. In one of these, the bar of justice was presided over by Justice Edgar J. Lauer of the NY State Supreme Court, whose wife was at the time under indictment in still another court as a member of a smuggling ring.
 
Item: The well-known investment house of G.L. Ohrstrom & Co., of New York and Chicago, was charged with fraud and market manipulations by the SEC.
 
Item: The Whitney case bobbed up again to plague the NY Stock Exchange. President Hutchins of the University of Chicago, recently elected amid great fanfare as a “public representative” to sit on the board of the “reformed” Exchange, suggested that some action be taken about certain Exchange members who had known of Whitney’s thefts but had failed to notify the authorities. Knowing quite well that these accessories-after-the-fact included several Morgan partners, the Exchange board voted, 27 to 1, that the Whitney case was closed. President Hutchins thereupon resigned.

“Publication of this book was purposely withheld during the September international crisis although Mr. Briffault had been working on it for two years and it had reached the publishers in August. Reason: it did not seem wise to weaken, however slightly, a democratic country’s already critical position.” (From an advertisement for Briffault’s The Decline & Fall of the British Empire.)
That’s awfully decent of you chaps, really.

Football is the opium of the bourgeoisie: “Analyzing the pages and departments of a newspaper, Dr. Phelps found on page 1 a record of the world’s failures. ‘Since August 1, especially, the front page has been devoted almost exclusively to failure and disaster,’ he said ... For a sense of victory instead of failure and defeat, readers might turn to the sports pages, he suggested.” (NY Times, Nov. 20.)

Last month I pointed out that any talk of “prosperity” was mere demagoguery so long as new capital investment continued at the low level of the last eight years. Some further evidence now comes to hand as to the current stagnation in the two key sectors: bank loans and new security issues. A few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve System of New York announced the lowest weekly total of commercial loans reported by its members in several years. Time recently stated: “for the first time in history, banks are holding more cash than their outstanding loans.” And on November 30, the SEC reported on new security issues in October. At first glance, this looked more hopeful: the month’s total was $405,100,000, highest in almost two years, and far above the September total of $106,800,000. But on closer acquaintance, this total was Jess impressive. Most of it – 68% – represented public utility issues, of which less than 3% was new capital, the remaining 97% being merely the exchange of one bond issue for another. Of the $130,000,000 in non-utility issues, $100,000,000 was split 50/50 between General Electric and Firestone Tire & Rubber. GE’s issue was “in part” to refund an earlier issue. Firestone planned to use $33,000,000 to pay off bank loans, $13,000,000 to retire funded debt, leaving just $4,000,000 for possible new investment.
As new fields for profitable investment fail to open up, finance capital, the heart of the whole system, must inevitably draw more and more of its lifeblood from the State. A strange thing has happened to American banking under the New Deal: the economic base once supplied by private industry has crumbled and has been largely replaced by new foundations provided by the Federal government. Thus the same Federal report showed that the New York banks that week had $3,000,000,000 invested in US Government securities as against only $1,000,000,000 in “other securities.”
“The few big banks doing well today,” Time notes, “are those like Chicago’s Continental Illinois National and New York’s Manufacturers Trust, which have gone whole hog into buying Government bonds.”
This swing towards the State was symbolized at the recent convention of the American Bankers Association, when the anti-New Deal clique which three years ago seized control of the ABA was defeated in a bitter fight by a pro-New Deal group. The successful candidate heads a bank which derives more than its capital from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It is also interesting that the anti-New Deal group is also anti-big city and anti-branch banking and is led by a pious Mormon banker from Utah. The big city banks are drawing even closer to the New Deal, their chief source of revenue.

A mysterious correspondent who signs himself “Janus,” sends in a page of smart remarks. His more outrageous flights – such as his reference to “the dark Broun taste” in the Stalinists’ mouths after Munich and his query whether the liberals are scared of being “browderbeaten” by the CP – I must categorically refuse to circulate. But I pass along, with thanks, a few of his more reasonable maxims: Earl Browder claims that new members are rushing into his party. Scientific explanation: nature abhors a vacuum ... All is not Mike Gold that glitters with generalities ... Doubts are said to be assailing the editors of the Nation and the New Republic as to the Moscow Trials. They are also reported to be suspecting that Sacco and Vanzetti got a raw deal, too ... Fascism means war, says the CP. True enough, but it forgets that the converse is also true: war means fascism ... So far the revolution that Simon Gerson was to have fomented in the Manhattan Borough President’s office has not materialized. Probably because there was no objective revolutionary situation there ... Stalinism is twentieth century vigilantism.

Two ladies of doubtful virtue are quarrelling. “You’re a whore!” cries one. “So are you!” retorts the other. This came to mind when I read, in a recent issues of Workers Age, a little editorial headed: Why Such Hypocrisy? It seems that Frank N. Trager, writing in the Socialist Review, had sharply criticised the Lovestoneites for their opportunistic support of Murphy in the Michigan elections, and had claimed that the Socialists in the UAW had honorably refused such support. The Age pointed out that Walter Reuther, the most eminent socialist in the UAW, had not only come out for Murphy but also for the entire Democratic slate. “Doesn’t the whole thing smack somewhat of hypocrisy and double-dealing?” triumphantly concluded the Age. A bit too triumphantly, in fact, since obviously if it is scandalous that Reuther supported Murphy, it is also scandalous that Lovestoneites supported Murphy. Some time ago, Euclid pointed out that quantities equal to the same quantity are equal to each other.

Of late there have been indications that the Stalino-liberals are beginning to unhyphenate themselves and revert to their former status of liberals, pure and extremely simple. The moral degeneration of Stalinism, as unmistakably revealed in the Moscow Trials, was not enough to alienate these gentry. Disregarding the stench of mass murder, the Nation and the New Republic dutifully swallowed the trials. But since the Munich Pact, it has become clear that Stalinism is not only corrupt but also impotent. The mighty Red Army is no longer seriously considered by military experts, Soviet foreign policy has succeeded only in completely isolating the USSR, the map of Europe is being redrawn without even a formal consultation with the Kremlin. Russia, in short, has sunk to the rank of second-rate power. This is a much more serious matter. The Stalino-liberals are beginning to look around for a safer perch. In his new book, Max Lerner ventures a few cautious, but clearly heterodox, remarks about the dictatorship of the proletariat, 1938 model. (His refuge he has long been preparing: the US Supreme Court, whose liberal members he has been assiduously flattering in the Nation for years. His new berth – a professorship of constitutional law at Williams College – is much snugger than 35 East 12 Street, which has become rather drafty of late.) Malcolm Cowley is also said to be increasingly uneasy about the firmness of the CP as a base for a literary man who wants to get ahead. Even John Strachey has been quarrelling in print with the New Masses. I can’t help remarking on one curious aspect of all this: that the liberals, those specialists in ethics who are constantly protesting against Marxism as “amoral,” “unprincipled,” and even “cynical,” should fail to recognize the moral failure of Stalinism until its material failure had become patent.

The Walsh-Healey Act provides that all manufacturers holding government contracts must pay minimum wages, to be determined for each industry by a Public Contracts Board. This fall the Board, after lengthy hearings, set minimum rates for the steel industry. On the surface, it looks like a great victory for labor. The Board’s 45-cents-an-hour minimum in the South and its 62.5 cents elsewhere are well above the minimum rates now being paid by most steel companies. Some 75,000 steel workers are expected to benefit. Furthermore, as the CIO News points out:
“Little Steel’s basis for anti-union activities – its fear of losing its competitive position – has been cut out from under it.”
But there is another angle, not mentioned by the News: why should the Little Steel workers pay dues to the SWOC when




they get the same wages as SWOC members anyway, and
they owe this not the SWOC but to the New Deal.




Something seems to have been cut out from under the SWOC as well.
The real victor here is not the SWOC but the US Steel Corporation, which harvests one more fruit of its shrewd alliance with the SWOC and the New Deal. The Steel Corporation backed up the SWOC in the hearings, and the new rates set by the Board are those already paid in the Corporation’s plants. Now the Corporation, for a number of reasons, can make steel more cheaply than most of the independents, especially the smaller ones. These companies can compete only by paying lower wages. (Bethlehem, for example, which is drastically affected by the new rates since it does more government work than any other steel company, has been paying from 56.5 to 59 cents an hour minimum, as against the new rate of 62.5 cents.) The small companies have been especially vociferous against the proposed new rates. Presenting a petition for reconsideration, their lawyer said: “Circumstances strongly support the suspicion that political considerations have played a part in the whole matter.” He was right. For two years the Steel Corporation, in the face of the indignation of its competitors, has been playing the New Deal’s game. This is one aspect of the present “appeasement” policy of the House of Morgan, whose relations with the White House have been ever more friendly. (The NY Times of Dec. 3 reports that TASS the Soviet news agency, has uncovered a “Fascist clique” in this country which is “preparing an offensive against the progressive measures of President Roosevelt.” TASS gave first place in this clique to “Financial King Morgan.” This is not the first time the Kremlin has been two years behind the march of history.)
The whole episode is a dramatic example of the illusory nature of working-class gains when they are won not by action of the workers themselves but by a three-cornered deal between labor bureaucrats, reformist politicians, and business men. The wage increases tie the workers more closely not to their own organizations but to the New Deal. And the Steel Corporation walks off with the main prize. Of all the big CIO unions, the SWOC is much the most rigidly bureaucratic, the least open to democratic rank-and-file influence. So long as this is the case, further “victories” of the SWOC, like this one, will simply mean that one group of capitalists has successfully used the SWOC against its competitors. And even if Little Steel signs up with the SWOC, it will mean only that its workers will be organized under one capitalist flag rather than another. For this the bloody and tragic 1937 strike was fought!

Footnote on Imperialism: It is harder to be a good imperialist than the Nation perhaps suspects. I refer not to that monstrous “betrayal”, the Munich Pact, but to the private war the British Army has been fighting on the Northwest frontier of India. “Strange as it may sound,” reports the Indian correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, “one is forced to the conclusion on the frontier that the present disturbed conditions suit the tribes much better than peace.” It appears that the British have been paying monthly allowances to the Mahsuds, a “friendly” tribe, to guard the roads against certain “hostile” tribes. These allowances come to $2,000,000 a year – a sum large enough to affect the economy of the whole region. Furthermore, the British Army must pay the Mahsuds for transport and provisions, bringing total annual expenses for the war up to some $15,000,000. The tribesmen seem to have admirably grasped the economic possibilities of their situation. A Mahsud can drive a truck loaded with supplies for some British outpost over the most “dangerous” roads in perfect safety, since the “hostile” tribesmen are just as anxious as are the Mahsuds to keep the British Army around. The abandonment of such an outpost would be a blow to native industry comparable to the closing down of a textile mill in Lowell, Mass. The Guardian hints that the “hostile” and the “friendly” tribes are in cahoots to keep such profitable customers on the frontier. Its correspondent reports that since the Army arrived, the land has tended to go out of cultivation. The Fakir of Ipi (whom the Guardian describes with British restraint as “a remarkable man in his own way”) and the other border chieftains rule over a land barren of coal, oil, and iron. And so they exploit to the hilt their one great natural resource: the British regiments.

According to Living Age, which picks the story up from Literaturnaya Gazeta, a Soviet author recently submitted a translation of Corneille’s Horace to the publishing house, Isskustvo. Hearing nothing, the translator finally got an interview with the Director of Isskustvo’s dramatic department. “May I inquire about your report on Horace?” he asked timidly. “So you’re this Corneille, are you?” said the Director contemptuously, and, before the dazed translator could say a word, he read him the following report:
“Too little action. The whole play is built on long monologues dealing with duty, customs, etc. All action seems to take place offstage. The characters are not living persons but types. Very low level of artistic quality. Therefore, since the play is not suitable for production, I cannot approve its publication by the Isskustvo.”

In my series last summer in The New International on the columnists, I never got around to a rather minor but for all that quite interesting specimen: J. Otis Swift, founder and führer of the Yosian Brotherhood, who contributes a daily nature piece to the Scripps-Howard press. J. Otis Swift is what an earlier generation would have called a “nature faker”. Every Sunday of the year his Yosians – in a dozen groups – roam the hills and dales around New York City, looking for pitcher plants, tanagers, nuthatches and other natural phenomena. Mr. Swift in person leads one of these expeditions, expatiating to his flock on the beauties of nature. He is said to have walked backward farther – in order to face his listeners – more miles than any other human being in history. In his daily column, News Outside the Door, Mr. Swift also does a good deal of walking backward. His column expresses – on a rather primitive level, to be sure, but all the more plainly for that reason – the reactionary nature of modern Back-To-Nature philosophizing. In a lush style, reminiscent of the old Chatauqua tradition, ornamented with references to classical lore, Mr. Swift plays variations on two simple themes: “The City Must Go” and “The Old Ways Are Best.” Unlike Wordsworth’s Peter Bell, who could see in the primrose by the river’s brim merely a primrose, Mr. Swift is an adept in the language of flowers. “The knot-grass, Polygonum Aviculare,” he writes, “lingers around what was the yard where children played, long after the family has scattered, the old folks sleep in God’s Acre, the children have learned, out in the world, there is no place like home.” The Virginia Creeper, or Woodbine, leads him to the most unlikely conclusions. This he includes in an essay on “historical weeds” because it “teaches that most great isms which started out to reform the world and bring about Utopia are ‘gone where the woodbine twineth,’ that is, forgotten cemeteries.” Although the woodbine would seem to be pretty thick on Mr. Swift’s own philosophy, he seems to conceive of himself as a deep thinker: “the cosmic dreamer, sitting on a log in Fernlundgrot.” “Oh yes,” he concludes one column, “there is a lot of serious thinking to be done along the lovely Swampside Trail.” A few days later he writes:
“It is paradise at sunrise along the Swampside Trail ... Over the steps beyond the Eastern arm of the water course, where little green herons often fish, are tall yellow locusts from which policemen’s clubs are made. Nature philosophers, loving peace, law and order, are glad there are so many locusts left in America.”
Yes, indeed, there is a lot of serious thinking to be done along the Swampside Trail.

Harry Hopkins Comes to Munich: The “appeasement” policy of the New Deal towards Big Business proceeds at precisely the same rate as the New Deal’s arms drive, since the one is patently dependent on the other. Which is to say that it proceeds at a rather brisk pace. The most dramatic and blatant instance is the recent TVA-Commonwealth & Southern deal. On January 30, the Supreme Court, in a 5-2 decision, threw out of court die suit which fourteen private utility companies had brought against the TVA. The majority opinion told the companies that “neither their charters nor their local franchises involve the grant of a monopoly or render competition illegal.” The decision was so broad that it seems to open the door to the Federal Government’s competing in any field of “private” enterprise. From a juridical point of view, this may well be the most important legal victory in the entire history of the New Deal. But law means very little when bigger matters are at stake. The leader of the fourteen utility companies was Wendell Willkie, head of the great Commonwealth & Southern Utilities Co., dominant in the Southern utility field. On February 4, five days after this great legal victory, TVA announced it had come to an agreement with its defeated foe. TVA has agreed to pay to Commonwealth & Southern for its Tennessee properties $80,000,000.
“The deal,” commented the NY Times financial editor, “received yesterday the overwhelming endorsement of every financial and utility executive in Wall Street ... The outstanding preferred stock and bonds of the Tennessee Electric Power Co., the company to be sold, rose sharply yesterday in response to the settlement news.”
A business man’s information service sent out from Washington notes:
“Government is paying a fair price for power properties taken over by the TVA. The companies say so, publicly and privately.”
And the Saturday Evening Post exploits the latest hero of the business community, advertising in its current issue:
“WHEN A BUSINESS MAN OUT TALKS POLITICIANS – That’s News ... The New Dealers, when they concluded the TVA-Commonwealth & Southern deal, admitted they had met their master. Read the story of Wendell L. Willkie on page 10.”
Celebration – for the business fraternity – was indeed in order. Mr. Willkie’s original asking price was $86,300,000. TVA countered with an offer of $55,000,000. A “compromise” at $80,000,000 means a complete rout of the New Deal. TVA is now going to pay for such ghostly items as “Good Will” and “Value as a Going Concern.” According to the Nation, Mr. Willkie included under the former “the value of having the highest ratio of domestic household usage and the lowest domestic rates in the United States.” Since these assets were created only by his system’s forced competition with TVA, this means that TVA paid Mr. Willkie for assets which it had itself created.
But why this sudden and catastrophic rout of the forces of reformism in the very hour of their victory? The general cause, of course, is the necessity the Administration feels for placating business in order to enlist its support in manoeuvring the nation into the next world slaughter. But the specific precipitant in this instance was that great champion of the underprivileged, Harry Hopkins, who now is fighting the battles of the overprivileged with equal ardor in his new job of Secretary of Commerce. According to a recent NY Times dispatch:
“While the case was still pending before the Supreme Court, Mr. Hopkins suddenly entered the picture. Reports sprang out of Washington that the President had asked him to seek a settlement of the row ... Within a matter of hours, the TVA directors were soliciting an audience with Mr. Willkie.”
And Messers. Alsop and Kintner, whose syndicated NANA column is one of the best sources on the New Deal, recently made it quite clear what has happened:
“Mr. Hopkins,” they write, “has been living in an ecstasy of conferences with high business executives. He has impressed most of them very favorably, and he has liked them well enough, so that now he hopes to bring some of the most eminent among them to serve as his special assistants at the Department of Commerce. Meanwhile, he has heard from them (if he did not know already) what business wants. ...”
Six days after Harry Hopkins persuaded the TVA directors to be “reasonable,” on February 10, the Public Utilities Commission of the state of Tennessee found the Tennessee Electric Power Co. – the subsidiary which Commonwealth & Southern sold to the TVA for $80,000,000 – guilty on 917 counts charging it with bribing the Chattanooga Free Press, a daily paper. It seems Tennessee Electric Power had paid large sums to the Free Press – incomparable name! – to slant its news and editorial columns against the TVA. The minimum fine on each of these counts is $500, making a sum total of $458,500 which Tennessee Electric Power Co. is legally supposed to pay the state of Tennessee. But again, these paper juridical matters shrivel in the fierce fire of actual capitalist property interests. I predict that either Tennessee Electric Power will get out of paying anything, or else – and this is by no means excluded – this fine was foreseen and TVA assumed responsibility for it in advance. To quote the realistic formulation of Jo Conn Guild, Jr., president of Tennessee Electric Power: “This whole thing is a lot of bunk.”
 




The Wallace Plan
Several months ago, in my New International column, I quoted a Washington “confidential News Letter” on an embryonic New Deal scheme. “Idea,” ran the report, “is to find ways of enabling more people to eat more food ... It appears to be a fact that &frac13 of our people, perhaps even ½, don’t get enough to eat ... So, step up consumption, eat up surpluses, thus aid farmers. That’s the basis idea. How? One way might be by socialism or communism. Another way is by improving existing distribution methods WITHIN the profit system.” What interested me at the time was the frank admission that (1) the American masses don’t get enough to eat under capitalism; and (2) communism would mean, for them, more food. But now the “other” way, WITHIN the profit system, has materialized. It makes a neat rounding out of the story.
The alternative to communism turns out to be Secretary Wallace’s ingenious orange and blue food card system, which was lately saluted in an Appeal editorial. On the surface, the Wallace Plan is designed actually to give the unemployed, in this seventh year of the New Deal, enough to eat. General Hugh Johnson, an admirer of the Wallace Plan, admitted recently in his daily column: “Government studies of W.P.A. wages have shown that, while the amount available for food for a family of four, for example, is enough to prevent starvation [Who says democracy doesn’t work? – D.M.] it is not enough to provide a minimum balanced diet, especially for children, in some of the foods of which there is a surplus – dairy products, eggs, fruit and vegetables.” (And let it not be forgotten that W.P.A. wages, just above the starvation level, are much higher than home and local relief.)
For their, above-starvation foodstuffs, the unemployed have had to depend on the erratic bounty of the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation, which buys up big lots of surplus farm products and gives them to the unemployed. The system is designed to stabilize farm markets rather than to meet human needs, and so the unemployed function as a sort of refuse dump for whatever our insane economic system overproduces at any given moment.
The Wallace Plan continues to use the unemployed as a dump for surplus farm products. But instead of the Government giving the food direct to the reliefers, it gives them blue cards, which are exchangeable at their grocers for whatever foodstuffs are officially designated “surplus” that week. The beauty of this new arrangement is that every one – except, of course, the ultimate consumer – gets his cut of profit, from wholesaler to retailer.
Nor is this all. Secretary Wallace has decided that the unemployed cannot be trusted to spend their nickels wisely, and so he also proposes that the amount of each relief check which he and the other New Deal supermen in their all-wisdom decide should be spent for food – that this amount be paid not in cash but in orange tickets. Like the blue tickets – which apply only to surplus commodities – these will be redeemable in any store for food. The same Washington News Letter from which I originally quoted, in a later issue revealed that the Wallace Plan will be tried out first in a few selected cities and then, if it works, will be extended everywhere. “Clothing and other necessities are not included in the plan now, but it is freely said they may be added later, IF the plan works on food.” I hope the unemployed workers of the country will show by demonstrations and by other suitable action that the Wallace Plan doesn’t “work,” that they are still adult enough to buy their own shoes and hats and food even if this cockeyed economic system prevents them from working productively. For their banners, I suggest two inscriptions: “Mother DOESN’T Know Best!” And this sentence from the Washington Letter: “Purpose of Plan is primarily farm relief, secondarily human relief.”
 

A Luxemburgite Objects
Some one who wants to remain anonymous writes in to endorse, on the whole, my recent remarks in this column on the S.W.P.’s handling of the Anti-Bund demonstration outside Madison Square Garden. But he also adds:
“I wish to register, as a Luxemburgite, that the comparison with Fascist showmanship goes a bit too far, because there are limits to left showmanship that do not restrict fascism. These limits relate to the degree to which a genuine social revolution is in its actual occurrence – as distinguished from demonstrations, meetings, etc. – a self-induced mass act, rather than something, as Rosa said, ‘led with a baton.’ The fascist coup d’etat is always accomplished under the baton, and this is one of the signs that it is not a social revolution. While the socialist revolution, no matter what role the Party plays as a gear, overflows the rim of the ordered and assumes a ragged, uneven character – with even the most conscious elements running around wild and improvising. And this has to be prepared for, too.
“So, while I agree with your general criticism, I suggest you add to it the thought that if all the Party members had been on their toes, thinking of the total effect of their act, they would, even without preliminary preparation, which would have been preferable, have thought of various improvised means for letting the crowds know about the S.W.P., the Appeal, etc. In short, I just want to strike one note for the individual side, along with your chord on the organizational. Both ought to develop together. Of course, this is a big subject, and I’m just poking around in it here.”
But I’d like to ask my Luxemburgian lover of spontaneity – and I’m all with him there, myself – just how the demonstrators, on their toes or not, could have improvised banners and placards out of thin air, or could have conjured up copies of the Appeal when none were sent from headquarters?
 




At long last, after many delays and false alarms, Daniel Guerin’s Fascism and Big Business is off the press. I am informed by persons whose testimony I believe to be reliable that they have seen with their own eyes a large number of copies neatly piled up in the offices of Pioneer Publishers. Considering that I wrote the introduction and helped get out the book, it is perhaps unnecessary to say that I consider it a most important work. We have had a flood of books on fascism, which in liberal circles has become the new demonology, but Fascism and Big Business stands out both as to form and content. Simply written, clearly organized, it should be of great use in workers’ educational and discussion groups.
Guerin analyzes the phenomenon of fascism in Marxist terms. That is, he deals not in backstairs gossip nor in Freudian psychology, but in basic economic factors. His primary question is always: who profits? He helps explode a myth which has become a platitude in certain liberal quarters: that fascism is a form of state socialism, that Hitler and Mussolini are middle class revolutionists, that the iron hand of the fascist state rests as heavily on business as on labor, etc. These propositions Guerin buries under a landslide of data as to the essentially capitalist nature of fascism. An especially interesting chapter he devotes to the struggle for power between the fascist “plebeians” and their big business masters. He shows that even though the plebeians seem to control entirely the State power, in fact when the real showdown comes (the Party “reorganizations” of 1923, 1925, and 1928 in Italy; the 1934 “Blood Purge” in Germany) the plebeians always knuckle under, and he shows why this must necessarily be the case. Above all, Guerin makes clear in copious detail that fascism can be fought only by the united, militant power of the workers. After reading his account of how the “progressive” governments of Giolitti and Bruening handed over the power to the fascists without a murmur, it takes an airtight closed mind to continue to believe in reformist political action. Guerin’s Marxist economic analysis leads him straight to the conclusion that the fascist drive to power can be smashed only by its natural enemy: the working class.
 

It Has Happened Here
Guerin writes of Italy and Germany, but our own experience bears out his points. There was the recent Nazi Bund meeting in Madison Square Garden, for instance. What could express better the policy of the Stalinists and the other reformist and “liberal”’ groups towards this incipient fascist threat than these words of Guerin: “Let us be careful not to reply to fascist violence, the reformist leaders said in both Italy and Germany; we should arouse ‘public opinion’ against us. Above all, let us avoid forming combat groups and semi-military bodies, for we should risk antagonizing the public authorities, who, we are confident, will dissolve the semi-military groups of fascism.” And what could be more closely applicable to the Madison Square Garden affair, where the 50,000 workers and other anti-fascists who demonstrated under S.W.P. leadership against the Bund were attacked and dispersed again and again by LaGuardia’s police – what could be more pat than this quotation from Guerin: “They counted, not on the militancy of the masses but on the Prussian police ... But the forces of ‘Law and Order’ backed up the Brown Shirts.” For “Berlin Sportspalast, 1932” read “Madison Square Garden, 1939.”
 

Patching Up the Barrel
Radek once wrote: “Fascism is the iron hoop with which the bourgeoisie tries to patch up the broken barrel of capitalism.” A great many people these days waste much time in demonstrating that an iron hoop is not the most comfortable thing in the world. They reason that since the business man under fascism suffers from all sorts of bureaucratic restrictions, he is sorry he ever heard of Adolf Hitler. Therefore, fascism is not a class phenomenon. Q.E.D. One more article along this line appears in the current issue of Harpers: Doing Business in Germany by Gunther Reimann. The interesting thing about Reimann’s article is that, although he thinks he is proving that the business man gets it in the neck under Hitler, the actual data he brings up tends to confirm Guerin’s analysis of the class nature of fascism. Thus Guerin writes that heavy industry (steel, iron, coal, etc.) for good economic reasons backs the fascist drive for power, while light industry (textiles, foods, and other consumer goods) in general opposes fascism – until it grows too strong to be peacefully suppressed, at which point light and heavy industrialists unite to place the fascists in power. Reimann’s article tells how the heavy industrialists, due largely to the rearmament program, are prospering as never before, while by comparison “the manufacturer of consumer goods appears as an unhappy Cinderella.” Guerin shows how the fascists hand back to private ownership many enterprises formerly operated by the State.
Finally, Guerin demonstrates that the condition of the small shopkeepers and petty bourgeois who flocked to Hitler’s banner became worse, not better, after their Fuehrer took power. Reimann calls the small retailer “the most depressed and the most restricted business man in Germany.” This is his major argument, in fact, to support his thesis that Nazism is not “the shield of private property.” But it is, to say the least, misleading to lump small shopkeepers and steel magnates under one head as “capitalists.” In fascist Germany, as Guerin abundantly demonstrates and as Reimann himself indicates, those who control the very heart of modern capitalism, the big industrial magnates, are still firmly in the saddle. “What is really happening in German business,” writes Reimann, “is a gradual fusion between private enterprise and State bureaucracy,”, Or, to put it another way, the capitalist magnates retain their class supremacy by taking over the State.
 





Calling in an Expert
The Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration is not to be confused with the Harvard Graduate School of Public Administration. The former – better known as the Harvard Business School – was founded years ago and has expanded into a long series of handsome Georgian buildings along the bank of the Charles River. The latter is comparatively recent, and by no means as large and resplendent. The Business School is by now one of the key institutions of American capitalism. The Government School has yet to win its spurs. But business men are rapidly learning that politics, and not economics, is the master art in the world of today. They are more and more coming to face the problem of how best to manage the rather awkward transition from democratic capitalism to fascist capitalism. Last week the Harvard Government School stole a big march on its older rival when it hired the greatest living expert on this delicate process. It announced the appointment of a permanent Professor of Government: Dr. Heinrich Bruening, Chancellor of the German Republic from 1930 to 1932.
 

Footnote on the Late Dr. Coster
I present for what it is worth an odd item in last week’s financial pages, an item whose precise social significance I confess I am unable to determine. It seems that the sales of McKesson & Bobbins, Inc., for January, 1939, were $12,070,000, as against $12,132,000 for the same month of 1938. This seems to indicate that “public opinion” disapproved of the late J. Donald Coster-Musica by just $82,000 worth out of a $12,000,000 gross. It is also confusing to learn that, although one element of the scandal was that McKesson & Bobbins had gotten into repeated trouble with Federal agencies because its drugs were impure or adulterated, yet its drug sales this January were actually a little bigger than they had been a year ago. Is the old saw actually true – that any publicity is good publicity?
 

The Customer is Never Right
Sheets are as scarce in the Third Reich as everything else except guns. The story is told of a housewife who managed to persuade a shopkeeper to sell her a single sheet. When she got home, she found a tag on it stating that boiling would have a disastrous effect. She took it back to the shop and asked to exchange it for one that could be laundered. “Certainly,” said the shopkeeper, “but you must first sign this.” And he gave her a paper bearing the words: I AM AN ENEMY OF THE FOUR YEAR PLAN. The lady changed, not her sheet, but her mind.
 

Non-Sectarian Stalinism
Last week I received in the mail a moving appeal for funds from a Mrs. J.C. Guggenheimer, who is treasurer of the Non-Sectarian Committee for Political Refugees. “Dear Friend,” it began, “We are asking you to help save a life – a life that is in imminent danger at the hands of Hitler’s executioner. The extradition of 1,500 men and women, German and Austrian refugees, who before Munich had found asylum in Czechoslovakia, is being demanded daily by Gestapo agents in Prague. The enclosed folder will explain their plight, proven by the fate of Peter Foerster, whose head fell in Weimar on December 21, 1938.” The folder detailed some heartrending facts about these anti-fascists, caught in the steadily contracting net of a Czechoslovakia going fascist. Foerster’s case was especially tragic: he had escaped to Prague from a German concentration camp. After Munich, the Nazis demanded his extradition, and executed him the day after he was put back across the border. Not one of the democracies would give him a visa. Nor would the Soviet Union, which has, as every one knows, refused to allow a single refugee to cross her heavily policed borders. Even members of the Czech Communist Party, according to all reports, have been refused Soviet visas. Russia’s attitude on these 1,500 anti-fascist refugees trapped in Czechoslovakia, in fact, is so scandalous that even the New Republic ventured a mild editorial reproof in its February 1 issue: “Russia has done nothing and promised nothing (though Foerster’s life could have been saved by a Russian or any other visa).”
All this is familiar enough. What gives Mrs. Guggenheimer’s letter a certain news value is that her “Non-Sectarian Committee for Political Refugees” has for its chairman the Hon. Vito Marcantonio, and bears as its subtitle, in smaller letters: “International Labor Defense.” Thus the Stalinists appeal for funds to save refugees whom the Kremlin is delivering over to Hitler’s executioners. I have written a naive and worried note to Mrs. Guggenheimer asking for an explanation of this paradox, but so far she has maintained a discreet silence on the subject.
 

The Penalties of Wealth
These are uneasy, dangerous times, when anything may happen. The unemployed worry about how they will feed themselves if W.P.A. is cut again. The employed worry about the rising tide of anti-unionism and the dubious political future of the Wagner Act. All of us hold our breath as the explosion of a second world war is averted from week to week. Even the debutantes, it seems, have their worries. “This season, there are a dozen uncertainties!” exclaims a current ad for Vogue magazine, and proceeds to list them: “Will you wear a starched, flirtatious petticoat? Or will you turn gypsy in plaids and stripes and jingling jewelry? Will you do your hair in a chignon and tie an 1860 bonnet under your chin? Or will you crop your curls in a ‘baby’ cut and tuck them under a crisp white sailor?” I am not up to some of the technical terms – “chignon” suggests nothing at all to me, and “crisp white sailor” suggests perhaps too much. But I gather that even Vogue’s clientele finds modern life terrifying and confusing. We should never forget that the rich have their troubles, just like all the rest of us.
 




In a story about the next world war, printed in a recent issue of the English literary magazine, Seven, there is a marching song which today especially has a certain grim point to it. The author of the story is G.S. Fraser, and he introduces the song thus:
As they marched, they sang a song which had become popular during the war now known as the “dress rehearsal” – the Spanish Civil War. A singularly ribald composition, it was said to be the work of a young English communist who had fought in the International Brigade. For obvious reasons (it was coarse, brutal, unorthodox), it had not been included in his slim, posthumous volume.
The song went like this, to a good marching tune:



Many the skies and the omens above
But few the defenders and feeble the love:
As I passed by Lerida, I heard a man moan:
The beggars, the beggars won’t let us alone!
They regild the saints, they reopen the church,
By our fine-spoken friends we are left in the lurch.
Our cause was most moral, of words we had tons.
But the beggars, the beggars, who gave them the guns?
We went to old Stalin until we were sick,
He said we would beat them with dia-lec-tic!
He said that pure logic would see them in hell!
But the beggars, the beggars maneuvered too well!
We went to old Blum, and he spoke very high,
But he thought of Herr Hitler, and left us to die.
There’ll be weeping and wailing in Paris cafe.
But the beggars, the beggars, they’re well on their way!
We went to Old England, her heart is of oak,
But she soon made us feel we were sorry we spoke.
She wrote us some verse, but blockaded Bilbao
For the beggars, the beggars to give us the kayo.
O, all you fine rebels, whose guns go rantan,
I am a poor sod of a Government man.
I fought till I blistered, I walked till I bust.
But of all the damned beggars, you aren’t the wust!





Gas Masks and the Class War
All over England these days the ominous letters, A.R.P., are blazoned on billboards, sprinkled through the news columns, discussed over tea tables. A.R.P. means “Air Raid Protection” – a series of measures which have so far been put into effect with neither efficiency nor enthusiasm. A certain Sir John Anderson recently stated publicly: “People write as if we ought to aim at making war safe for civilians. My opinion is that we cannot make war safe for civilians.” Sir John’s opinion was heard all over England: he is Chamberlain’s Minister for National Defense. The reason for Sir John’s apathy is the simple fact that in England, as in the other great democracies, nine out of ten citizens are not “people of importance,” i.e., people of enough property to make any difference – except to themselves – whether they are blown to bits or not. Those who can pay for it have all the A.R.P. they want, and of the very best quality. Even in the gas masks issued by the Government to civilians the class lines are sharply drawn. I am told by a returned traveller that there are three types of masks, costing respectively $5, $2.50, and $.90. Every Englishman is free, of course, to buy whichever of these he likes. (“How just are the laws of the Republic,” said Anatole France, “which with stern impartiality forbid the wealthy as well as the poor to steal bread and to sleep in the parks.”) But somehow the well-to-do generally end up with the $5 type, which is a really excellent commodity; the petty bourgeoisie with $2.50 type, which is reasonably effective; and the great mass of workers and unemployed with the ninety cent type, which loses in a month or two such slight protective value as it originally had. My informant also told me that in a recent London slum fire, a tenement dweller put on one of these cheap gas masks to fight his way through the smoke and flames. He was found later, asphyxiated.
 

“Suffer the Little Children ...”
Last Sunday’s New York Times carries a revealing story on another aspect of A.R.P. in our sister democracy across the sea. The A.R.P. officials estimate there are 2,000,000 children in London and other cities who, in case of war, must be moved out into the countryside if they are to escape being bombed. They have been trying to find refuges for some of these children in the great English country estates.
“The protests,” comments the article, “may seem surprising to any one laboring under the impression that Britain is a democracy on the style of the United States or France ... Most British children living in the cities are poor. And as a Suffolk doctor put it very neatly in a letter to the editor: ‘Children from working class areas in the towns will not fit in with middle class or upper middle class families in the country. Their ways are completely different.’”
A hunting squire in Gloucestershire “urged the government to remember that slum children would not be happy in the country but would prefer the desolate South Wales mining towns – ‘more like what they were used to’.” Viscount Hailsham, until a few months ago Lord Chancellor, asks a whole series of “legalistic questions,” one of them being who will pay him for damage done his property by the children. The United Ratepayers Advisory Association has organized protests in 150 tax districts. Its slogan: “THINK OF THE DANGERS – DIRT, DISEASE, THEFT, VANDALISM, IMMORALITY, AND STRIFE!” Nonetheless, the article concludes in a more cheerful vein, “most of the better off are quietly preparing to put children either in cottages or in a separate part of the house where there is no good furniture to be scratched.” The Duke of Connaught, great-uncle of the King, has been pressed into service by the Prime Minister, who “felt it expedient to ask the royal family to show that such things are ‘done’.” The Duke has announced that he will allow 200 Cockney kids to find shelter in his country home. The article hastens to add: “The youngsters, to be sure, will not be admitted to the Duke’s house itself but will be put up in servants’ cottages ...” The Duke of Connaught suffers the little children to come unto him – but by the servants’ entrance, please.
 



II
Social Consciousness in Steel
When Europe went to war in 1914, the American steel industry lost no time in squeezing the last drop of profit from its strategic situation. As Allied orders poured in, prices soared, profits rose to unheard-of figures. Even after the United States entered the war, steel prices were maintained at prices high enough to yield huge profits. After vainly appealing to the steel-masters’ “patriotism,” the Wilson Administration was driven to threaten nationalization. This bluff, which every one knew the government had no intention of backing up, failed to move the steel industry. As Judge Gary, its spokesman, coldly remarked in March of 1918, just as the Germans were getting their last and most nearly successful “break-through” under way: “The manufacturers must have reasonable profits in order to do their duty.” Profits first, then patriotism.
In the opening weeks of this war, we find an amazing reversal of this policy. Overnight, as German guns roared in Poland and German torpedoes sent British ships to the bottom, a “buyers’ market” in American steel changed into a “sellers” market.” Orders from Europe began to pour in – for rails, for pipe, for scrap iron, light steel, and a hundred other types of non-military steel products. (The Neutrality Act forbids sale of munitions, but every ton of rails exported to a belligerent country releases that much of its own productive capacity for munition making.) The reaction to this flood of export orders was unexpected. On September 15, the Steel Corporation’s chief subsidiary, Carnegie-Illinois, announced that prices on light steel for the last quarter of the year would be the same as they had been in the third quarter. This policy of no price increases so far has been followed by the other major companies in publishing their last-quarter prices. And this is in spite not only of a rush of new business but also of a rapid rise in the prices of such raw materials as pig iron, spiegeleisen, and ferromanganese.
 
“Industrial Statesmanship”
The N.Y. Times, announcing this seven-days’ wonder, comments that “while this policy reflects the known desires of the Administration in Washington and takes into account the nationwide fear of high prices,” it is by no means popular with many steel men, “particularly those of senior rank.” It is not customary in the steel business for the “known desires of the Administration” to be deferred to, nor have the steel barons in the past shown any concern over high prices – quite the contrary. Why this excess of social consciousness?
The Times’ explanation is as puzzling as the fact itself:
“The view that the price of steel has an important bearing on the national wage and price structure ... was held to be a more important arguments against an immediate price advance than the sudden change from a buyers’ to a sellers’ market in the last fortnight, allowing prospects for handsome profits after a long period of lean earnings ... The steel industry has given evidence of industrial statesmanship which is quite at variance with the traditions and experience of former periods of prosperity.”
It is clear that something much more potent than “industrial statesmanship” must have induced the steel companies to temporarily forego “handsome profits.” This new policy is a particularly dramatic illustration of the institutional nature of both war and capitalism in the year 1939.
 
Towards State Capitalism
War in our time seems to have become such a gigantic social and economic enterprise, requiring such staggering capital investment and such a centralization of control, as to be beyond the grasp of even the most powerful private capitalist group or corporation. The problems raised by modern war, in neutral as well as in belligerent countries, can only be met by the state – acting, of course, as the agent, trustee, and executive Committee of the bourgeoisie. Hence the lead taken by the Administration, not “Wall Street” in arranging war credits for the Allies in this country. And hence this renunciation on the part of the steel industry of its sacred “right” to charge all the traffic will bear – a renunciation of immediate, individual profits for the sake of the greater security of the entire economic system. The Administration was the better able to persuade the steel industry to follow its lead because the present head of the U.S. Steel Corporation is a very different sort of industrialist from the stubborn and individualistic Judge Gary. When the House of Morgan two years ago put at the head of the Steel Corporation young E.R. Stettinius, son of a former Morgan partner, it served notice that a new era was beginning. For Stettinius has worked closely with the Roosevelt Administration ever since NRA days, and he has continued this “cooperation.” He was inevitably chosen to head the War Resources Board recently set up by the War Deal. In Stettinius, the “Morgan man,” the head of the nation’s biggest industrial corporation, the White House intimate, one aspect of the War Deal – and right now the most obvious aspect – is symbolized.
But Stettinius is also symbolic of the changing nature of American big business. As stock ownership has become more and more widely scattered, the conception of “ownership” has become increasingly vague. What Walter Rathenau wrote in 1918 of the then more advanced German capitalist system, is now applicable to our own:
“The claims to ownership are subdivided in such a fashion, and are so mobile, that the enterprise assumes an independent life, as if it belonged to no one. It takes an objective existence, such as in earlier days was embodied only in church and state, in a municipal corporation, in the life of a guild or religious order ... The depersonalization of ownership, the objectification of enterprise, the detachment of property from the possessor, leads to a point where the enterprise becomes transformed into an institution which resembles the state in character.” (Quoted in Berle and Means’ The Modern Corporation and Private Property)
This development, of course, has not affected the social base of the bourgeoisie, which still remains in its control, through ownership, of the means of production. But it has had a great, and all too little realized, effect on the agencies through which the bourgeoisie maintains its class rule. This is true above all in the supreme crisis of war. American capitalism went into the last war with a laissez-faire philosophy – though already its economic foundations had been largely institutionalized. This war finds the state and the corporation, Washington and Wall Street grown much closer together – and the shock of war, the supreme crisis of any social system, has already in the brief space of two weeks enormously hastened the process of fusion, as the overnight replacement of the old reformist “brain trusters” with Wall Street’s “men” in the top circles of the Administration dramatically indicates.
 



“While it isn’t written in the Constitution, nevertheless it is the inherent duty of the Federal government to keep its citizens from starving.” – Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933.
“The Federal government must and shall quit this business of relief.” – Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1935.
 
[Introduction]

I. Relief Under the Old Deal

II. New Deal Relief, 1933–1938

III. Relief in 1939, the Year of Transition

IV. The Future of Relief Under the New Deal
 



It is worth paying some attention to President Roosevelt’s letter of Sept. 9 explaining why he was cancelling his radio address on “Democratic Women’s Day.”
“A week ago,” he wrote, “I might consistently have spoken words primarily addressed to our Democratic women. But the events of the past few days render it imperative that every utterance of mine in these days of tension be addressed to all of our citizens, regardless of sex, age or political affiliation. We must all stand together in a firm resolve to bear witness before all nations to our unshaken patriotism ... Our plain duty now is to fulfill our obligation to the nation, regardless of political or partisan considerations.”
This is more than the usual star-spangled stuff about “national” interests coming before any “petty partisan” concerns. It is the most dramatic expression of a new major tendency in American political strategy.
In issuing a formal invitation to Republican leaders to confer with him on current state affairs, Governor Lehman of New York writes: “Partisanship and political interest must at this time be outlawed. I propose a truce on politics ... Political parties should combine their efforts for the good of the nation.” Addressing the heads of the National Youth Administration, Mayor LaGuardia expresses the hope that the youth of America would remain “calm and serene” in these stormy times and would join in the movement for national unity, which “would serve as a fine example” to Europe.
The President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce talks of “goodwill” and “great tolerance” as prime requisites for this crucial time.
 
Even Dies Joins “National Unity”
The sweet atmosphere of tolerance and brotherly love has even spread to the Dies Committee. When one unregenerate member the other day tried to infer from Browder’s testimony that the New Deal was “Communistic,” one of his colleagues angrily rebuked him for “playing cheap politics.” And Chairman Dies actually took some pains to lead Gitlow to admit that neither William Green nor John L. Lewis is a Communist. Furthermore – “Mr. Dies asserted that the committee did not want any implications drawn from the testimony that either the AFL or the CIO were Communist or Communist-dominated organizations.”
All this means that when an imperialist nation like the United States prepares to go to a war, the first thing that must be done is to cajole and browbeat the masses into suspending hostilities on the class-war front at home. Any sort of political disagreement becomes potentially dangerous, since it may open the door a crack for a working-class attack on the status quo. Hence the bourgeois politicians try to establish a sort of “moral disarmament” of all politicians, especially those with labor following. A truce in the class war is the required condition of a declaration of war abroad.
 
The Strategy of Disarming Labor
There are two main aspects to this strategy.
On the one hand, the forces of labor are crushed, gagged, or persuaded to keep silent. The Dies Committee’s new-found concern for the good names of William Green and John L. Lewis simply means that the Congressional reactionaries are beginning to see the trade union bureaucrats as, potentially, a means of easing the American workingclass into the coming war, just as they thus served in the last war. The iron hand concealed in the velvet glove of persuasion has already made itself felt. The day before the President wrote his little message to the Democratic women, he announced, in his decree of “limited emergency,” that the Department of Justice is to take on a number of extra G-men to help combat “subversive activity.”
There can be little doubt that, as the war crisis sharpens over here, the Administration intends to crack down more and more widely on any sort of labor and left-wing opposition to its war drive.
“We must, in these critical times,” said the President to the Democratic women, “maintain our old loyalties and the old ways of life upon which all of our happiness rests. To do this we must exercise a vigilant guardianship over our children. We must protect them from every evil force which would shake their faith in our fundamental institutions of democracy.”
It is pretty clear just what these “evil forces” are, and just what sort of “unity” the President wants to enforce on the nation.
The other arm of this “national unity” strategy is to turn the actual running of the government over more and more to the direct representatives of big business. In a capitalist society, “unity” means that the masses accept the status quo, which means in turn that a reformist government like the New Deal can increasingly dispense with the pretense of being independent of and even antagonistic to the ruling class.
 
Wall Street Moving into Washington
In my last article I described the beginning of the influx of Wall Street leaders into the government. In the last two or three days, the process has gone on faster than ever. The crucial post of assistant secretary of the Treasury in charge of customs and shipping (described as “the government’s chief neutrality officer”) has just been given to Basil Harris, vice-president of the U.S. Lines and a prominent shipowner. The War Resources Board has acquired a new member: John Hancock, a partner in the powerful Wall Street banking firm of Lehman Bros. Three more “dollar-a-year” men have been appointed to the Treasury: two conservative economists, and Walter W. Stewart, one-time aide to the late Ogden Mills and American adviser to the Bank of England.
Since the European war began, as I also noted last time, there has been a tendency for under-secretaries to shove aside the regular cabinet members. Another example is the fading out of Harry Hopkins as Secretary of Commerce and the rising star of his assistant, Edward J. Noble, a wealthy, energetic young manufacturer (Life Savers candy mints). In the words of Arthur Krock of the N.Y. Times:
“As the war offers new problems and perplexities to commerce, and the blockade of Germany offers opportunities to regain South American trade in this country, Mr. Noble’s function is steadily broadening and increasing.”
The President’s cabinet has been expanded to meet the crisis. From now on, three new men will take part in air cabinet meetings – though none of them is of cabinet rank. One is John Carmody, the mildly liberal head of the Federal Works Agency. The second is Jesse Jones, head of the Federal Spending Agency, a professional banker and a Garner Democrat. The third is none other than Paul V. McNutt, the semi-fascist Indiana politician whose appointment to the post of Social Security Administrator so shocked the President’s liberal supporters a month ago. McNutt is evidently becoming one of the inner circle of Presidential advisers.
And what has happened to the bright young liberals who used to have the President’s ear? What has become of Jerome Frank? Of Tommy Corcoran and Ben Cohen? Of Mordecai Ezekiel and David Cushman Coyle and Leon Henderson? The outbreak of war seems to have snuffed out their flame overnight. As Stephen Early, the President’s confidential secretary, put it the other day, when reporters asked him what had become of the “Brains Trust” – “That’s all out the window now.”

SECTION I:
Relief Under the Old Deal
“Primarily a Community Problem”
Unemployment is not, of course, a phenomenon peculiar to our times. It has always been an integral part of capitalist economic organization, a useful and necessary weapon in the hands of the ruling class. Likewise, there has always been a certain amount of unemployment relief. In the last century, Boston had its Provident Wood-yards, where the jobless cut wood for their bed and supper. (When more wood was produced than could be sold, boondoggling was resorted to: half the men would be set to work cording up logs into piles which the other half would then tear down.) In the winter of the 1877–1878 depression, the city of Washington set its unemployed to grading streets, at fifty cents a day. During another winter of deep depression, 1893–1894, Philadelphia spent $2,000,000 to keep alive 100,000 jobless men and their families – $20 a family. [1] That terrible winter brought forth Coxey’s Army, the first great “hunger march” of unemployed citizens to the national capital. It also produced President Cleveland’s celebrated epigram, when it was suggested to him perhaps the Federal government should appropriate funds for relief: “The people should support the government. The government should not support the people.” This majestic pun remained the last word on Federal unemployment policy throughout the next forty years.
In these early decades, there was mass unemployment and great suffering during the periodic economic crises, but these were emergencies, disasters like floods or fires which were brief and violent interruptions of the normal order of things. After the war, however, mass unemployment arose for the first time as a chronic problem. The Federal government remained as aloof as ever, but the city governments had to take over more and more of the relief burden. Long before 1929, private charity had proved inadequate. “As early as 1929 more than three-fourths of the relief bill was paid from public funds.” [2] Between 1911 and 1929, in sixteen large cities, population increased 41%, general expenses of government 256%, and relief expenditures 1,118%. [3] In the 1921–1922 depression, the number of unemployed was estimated at between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000, or one out of every seven non-agricultural workers in the country. President Harding met the crisis in the best Cleveland tradition, convoking a great “committee” of bankers, industrialists, and “labor leaders” under the chairmanship of his Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover. The committee, after much longwinded deliberation, decided that unemployment relief was “primarily a community problem”, talked vaguely of housing, roads, and public construction programs, suggested that the number of available working hours be evenly divided among the number of available workers (the ancestor of Hoover’s later “share-the-work” campaign, the most barefaced and unblushing attempt ever made by big business to shift the entire burden of unemployment onto the shoulders of the working class), and finally adjourned with an admonition of “patriotic patience on the part of all our people”. [3a]
But even more alarming than the unprecedented number of unemployed in the 1921 depression was the fact that all through the booming Twenties, except for 1929, there were never less than 1,500,000 men out of work, according to the minimum figure of the conservative Hoover Committee on Recent Economic Changes. [1*] By the time the bottom dropped out of things in 1929, unemployment was already a serious social problem.
 
The Great Disintegration
As the economic decline went on unchecked from 1929 to 1930 to 1931 to 1932, as the total number of unemployed reached five million, seven million, eight, ten million, and as the Hoover administration refused to do anything about it except issue optimistic statements, more and more strange and – to the bourgeoisie – disturbing things happened. American capitalism seemed to be going to pieces right before every one’s eyes, not because of any revolutionary upsurge of the masses – there were only sporadic outbursts – but because the system’s own contradictions were shattering it. Capitalism seemed, for a few years, to be breaking up of its own weight.
One million boys and men, and a few women, wandered about the country, homeless, looking for work, riding the freights. In the winter of 1932, fifty of them were killed on a single railroad, one hundred crippled. The police chief of the Southern Pacific Railway told a Senate committee that 79,200 “trespassers” were thrown off SP trains in 1929, 683,500 in 1932, and that of these three-quarters were under 25 years of age. The Kansas City police estimated that 1,500 men and boys rode into or out of the city every day on the freights ... In Oakland, Cal., the unemployed lived in sections of sewer pipe. In Arkansas, they took to caves and burrows in the Ozark mountains ... Detroit’s relief rolls listed two families after whom streets were named ... In West Virginia, children stood shoeless in the breadlines in the dead of the winter of 1931, and in one school 99 out of 100 of the miners’ children were found to be ten pounds or more underweight ... The records of the hospitals of New York City – where relief was comparatively generous – noted under “Cause of Death” in fifty cases during 1931: “Malnutrition” or “Starvation” ... When Henry Ford made a public offer of jobs in March, 1932, tens of thousands of men mobbed the great River Rouge plant, were met by city and company police with riot guns and dispersed, leaving four dead and fifty wounded ... Father Cox led an “army” of unemployed to Washington. The Bonus Army, primarily an unemployed movement, camped along the Potomac until Hoover had their hovels burned by the police and army ... Two hundred miners and their families were found living under a bridge in Arizona. Such encampments of the jobless, expropriated from their homes by the depression, sprung up on the outskirts of every big city, and were universally known as “Hooverville” ... Sometimes people refused to obey the rules of the game. It took a squad of deputies and three hundred rounds of machine gun ammunition to evict one family from its farm near Elkhorn, Iowa ... Mayor Cermak of Chicago wired the RFC: “If I cannot have funds for relief, I cannot answer for law and order.” ... The Hoover Administration deported 18,000 aliens in a single year of the depression ... In New York City evictions increased 30% in 1930, foundlings 100% ... Orders were issued to the Illinois National Guard in 1931:
“Blank cartridges should never be fired at a mob. Never fire over the heads of rioters. The aim should be low, with full charge and battle sight.” [4]






Chart I: Unemployment and Relief, 1933–1939




Sources: Figures on unemployment from AFL monthly estimates; figures on relief up to June, 1938, are from Report on Progress of the WPA Program, June 30, 1938; later figures are estimated.


 


This chart shows the month-by-month fluctuations of unemployment and relief under the New Deal. The upper line represents the total number of unemployed workers – “employables” only. The middle line shows the total number of households – not workers – receiving any kind of relief, Federal of local, home relief or work relief. The lower line shows the total households on work relief, which includes CWA (1933–1934), the Emergency Work Program of FERA (1934–1935), WPA (1936–1939), and CCC (1933–1939).
All these work relief programs were paid for either entirely or mainly with Federal funds. Up to 1935, 75% of all relief, home or work, was paid for out of the Federal treasury. Since then, all home relief has been paid for by the states and local governments, and the New Deal has limited its responsibility to WPA Note that the only time relief under the New Deal even approached providing for the bulk of the unemployed was in the very brief CWA interlude, and that since the slump in the fall of 1937 (whose severity can be gauged by the steep rise in unemployment shown here) relief has increasingly failed to keep up with unemployment.
In reading this chart, two points should be kept in mind. On the one hand, the relief line would not be expected to go as high as the unemployment line, since there is often more than one unemployed worker in a family. A WPA survey in March, 1935, for example, showed that in 4,200,000 families then on relief there were 6,200,000 unemployed workers. On the other hand, the AFL unemployment estimate, used here, probably considerably underestimates the number of unemployed. The only actual count that has ever been attempted – the Federal “unemployment census” taken in November, 1937 – showed about 2,000,000 more unemployed workers than the AFL had estimated for that particular week.
The gap in the “unemployment” line, by the way, occurs because at that point the AFL changed its method of computing unemployment, causing a sharp revision downward.






They tried everything, except relief, to “solve” the unemployment “problem”. Everything, that is, which would put the major burden where it rightfully belonged under capitalism: on the shoulders of the working class. Some one figured out that if everybody bought an apple every day from an unemployed man, the “problem” would be solved, and there was a period when every street corner in the business and shopping districts of New York had its apple seller with his box of apples. There were great national drives to raise funds for the “Community Chest”, to which every one, rich and poor, was expected to contribute his “fair share” for relief. In some cities, “block aid” campaigns were staged, the idea being that the inhabitants of each city block took care of their own unemployed. Thus the Astorbilts were responsible for seeing that their neighbors, the Vanderpoels, didn’t starve; and the Tony Pasquales, jobless for two years, had to see to it that their neighbors, the Mike Wochniks, also jobless for two years, got enough to eat. Equally ingenious was the great “share-the-work” campaign initiated by the Hoover administration and cheerfully promoted by the big employers. The idea here was that such work as there was should be equally divided among the available workers. The effect of this equitable arrangement was to relieve unemployment by cutting in half the average earnings of each worker. According to National Industrial Conference Board figures, average earnings in manufacturing in June 1929 were $28.69, and by the end of 1932, were $16.88. (Also, despite all this work-sharing, 40% of all workers by then had been laid off completely.) Finally, many of the unemployed themselves were driven to seek to escape completely from the capitalist system by organizing cooperative and barter exchange groups. Such islands of a more primitive economy were to be found all through the American capitalist structure in 1932. But there was no escape here, either. The history of the Unemployed Citizens League of Seattle, the most famous of such groups, illustrates clearly the ultimate futility of such efforts to build socialism in one county.
 
“No One Has Starved”
But in spite of apple-selling, Community Chests, block-aid, share-the-work, and barter groups, the unemployed continued to increase and to ask to be fed. “No one has starved,” was the only reply the Hoover administration made to all criticisms of its refusal to give relief. Even this modest claim was shown to be a lie by a well-documented and scathing review of Federal relief policies printed in Fortune in September 1932. The quintessence of Hooverian relief policy was summarized in a sentence in a letter written in September 1931 by Walter S. Gifford, head of the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and then chairman of the President’s Organization on Unemployment Relief. “To date,” wrote Mr. Gifford, “this committee has recommended that, as far as possible, unemployment relief be given to the individual in his home, thereby keeping him out of the public eye.” [5]
But no amount of keeping the jobless out of sight could prevent their numbers increasing daily. As the depression worsened, as new millions joined the ranks of the unemployed, as the savings of the unemployed were inexorably exhausted, the mass pressure for relief, militantly led at that period by the Communist and other radical parties, became increasingly hard to resist. Private charity first tried to cope with relief, and nation-wide drives for contributions were put on in 1931 and 1932 by Mr. Gifford’s committee. This proved inadequate, and the resources of local governments were next drawn upon. In twelve Pennsylvania cities, for example, private relief expenditures jumped from $1,700,000 in 1930 to $9,000,000 in 1932, but in the same period public relief funds rose from $2,400,000 to $16,800,000. [6] After 1932, private charity fell off sharply, and today less than 5% of all relief comes from this source. By 1932 the states were forced to come to the rescue of their local governments, and when Roosevelt took office in March, 1933, about $200,000,000 had been spent or appropriated by the states for relief. [7]
In the spring of 1932, Congress made relief history when it voted to permit the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to lend $300,000,000 of its funds to the states for relief purposes. The money was loaned, not granted outright, and Congress’ action was dictated as much by concern over the financial condition of the states and cities as over the sufferings of the unemployed. Its action was, even so, a historic event: for the first time the Federal government had accepted some responsibility for unemployment relief. President Hoover vetoed the bill, and it was repassed over his veto a week later. Its significance was more as a gesture than anything else, for up to the inauguration of Roosevelt a year later, the RFC had only lent out $80,000,000 for relief purposes. Relief even in this last year of the Hoover regime never got much above a national average of $7 a month per family. But Hoover’s instinct as a bourgeois politician was correct: this bill set a precedent. It opened the sluice gates, however small a crack, of the only reservoir of capital large enough to keep the unemployed millions above the level of slow starvation: the credit of the Federal government. Hoover’s genial successor, after a few years of experimentation, is doing his best to close the gates.
 
Footnote
1*. Just how conservative this figure is may be gathered from the fact that the Hoover Committee put the unemployed for 1927 at 2,055,000. while Lewis Corey, writing in The Annalist for March 9. 1928, set the figure at 3,606,000.

SECTION IV:
The Future of Relief Under the New Deal
This is the transition year in New Deal relief policy, but transition to what? The future depends on too many outside factors – notably the possibility of a European war, which may already be an actuality by the time this appears in print – for any very definite predictions. But there are two main tendencies in the Administration’s relief policies of late years which seem to point towards the kind of relief most likely to develop in the future. Let us conclude with some consideration of what each of these means to the unemployed masses.
 
Orange Stamps, Blue Stamps
For some months now the New Deal has been experimenting with a new way of distributing surplus farm produce to the unemployed. There is nothing new in the basic idea. Even Hoover’s Federal Farm Board used to hand over large quantities of surplus wheat and cotton to the Red Cross for free distribution among the unemployed. And after the disastrous political kickback from the original AAA policy of ploughing under cotton and destroying hogs – an error which to this day provides excellent ammunition to the New Deal’s opponents – the Administration turned to the same method to disembarrass itself of some of the huge stocks of farm products it bought to keep up farm prices. For years now the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation has been shipping carloads of free food to local relief authorities. Last year it gave away $62,000,000 worth. This was a mere drop in the bottomless bucket of New Deal farm subsidies. It was of peculiar importance, however, in the general relief picture.
When the Federal government in 1935 threw back onto the states the burden of supporting most of the unemployed, every one knew that in large areas neither the resources nor the willingness existed to do much supporting. It was politically impossible, however, for the New Deal to allow any large number of citizens to starve to death – to starve suddenly, that is, gradual starvation being another matter and politically quite permissible. Here is where the FSCC came in. Its food has always been distributed with the formal stipulation that it is to be used to supplement relief and not in place of relief. The stipulation was purely formal, however, and there are no recorded instances of G-men being sent to track down violations. In many rural areas, especially in the South and Southwest, surplus commodities have been the principal staff of life of the unemployed population. It is an unsteady staff to lean on: one week it may be cabbages, prunes and celery, the next butter and grapefruit, and the third navy beans, radishes, and eggs. But it explains how unemployed families in Oklahoma can live on $4 a month – the rest of the explanation being they don’t eat much.
In the past, the FSCC simply bought the produce in the wholesale market and shipped it to the relief authorities for distribution. The new plan is much more ingenious. Relief families are sold orange stamps, good at their grocer’s for any kind of foodstuffs, but only for food. The inducement to buy is that with every $1 of orange stamps, they get, free, 50 cents worth of blue stamps. These latter are good only for whatever farm commodities the FSCC declares to be “surplus” that week. The local relief authorities then pay the grocer cash for his orange stamps and the FSCC pays him cash for his blue stamps. Thus surplus commodities, instead of being shortcircuited from wholesaler to the consumer, go through all the regular channels of trade, with each middleman and retailer making his profit in the process. It means that the food trade as well as the farmer now gets a Federal subsidy.
The parentage of this ingenious plan can be traced to a meeting of wholesalers and retailers held in Chicago early in 1939. The assembled merchants adopted the plan with enthusiasm and arranged to press it in Washington. [43] In March, it was formally announced by Milo Perkins, the aggressive and high-powered young head of the FSCC, at a meeting in Washington of the National Food and Grocery Conference Committee. According to Business Week, Mr. Perkins, who used to be a manufacturer himself, made a “highly favorable impression” on the assembled grocers, who were delighted to find him “a practical business man who understands business problems”. [44] Secretary Wallace has also claimed paternity of the plan. The one thing certain is that no one connected with giving relief to the unemployed had very much to do with it.
The next step was to try out the plan on the dog – i.e., the unemployed. Every one understood this might be a ticklish business. At the Washington conference, it was agreed that a careful preliminary sounding-out should be made of various communities, and that the plan would be experimentally launched only in those where the unemployed seemed to be receptive. On May 16, it was first tried out, in Rochester, N.Y. There was one significant change in plans. As originally worked out in Washington, the plan was compulsory. Government experts were to determine “scientifically” just how much of a relief family’s budget should be spent on food, taking into consideration, of course, geographical and other factors. This amount would be deducted from the family’s relief check and given it in the form of orange stamps, good only for food. To this would be added the 50% “bonus” in blue stamps. By the time the Rochester test was made, however, the plan had been made voluntary. The unemployed were paid their usual cash relief, and could buy stamps or not as they chose. Even so, there was much nervousness as to just how the plan would go over. A half dozen high New Deal officials travelled to Rochester to watch its first steps in life. The response from those on relief was reasonably favorable – the local grocers, of course, were more than pleased – and it was decided to try it next in Dayton, Ohio. Again, the original plan was to make it compulsory, so as to compare it with Rochester, but at the last moment the New Dealers again lost their nerve. The plan has to date been tried out successfully in four cities and seems to have a big future before it. This year the FSC expects to spend as much as $100,000,000 on it – almost double last year’s figure. Politically, the plan is a masterstroke. It gives the unemployed more to eat. And it subsidizes not only the farmers but also the wholesale and retail merchants. These latter, unaccustomed to Federal largesse, have been loud in their rejoicings. And the small business vote has never been spurned by American politicians.
 
Back to the Grocery Basket
It seems ungrateful to look such a fine gift horse in the mouth, but there is a great deal more, for the unemployed, in the project than an addition to their diet. The compulsory feature, temporarily suspended, may easily be slipped back once the thing gets working smoothly. (Even now relief families must buy orange stamps to get the blue “bonus”, thus submitting their buying to some degree of official regulation.) From stamps for food it is a short step to stamps for clothing, and for everything else it seems wise to permit the jobless to have, until their entire consumption is regulated by decree and they live a caste apart, cut off from the rest of capitalist society on a moneyless, subsistence level. Already it has been unofficially announced that the plan will be extended to cotton textiles, in order to get rid of between 600,000 and 700,000 bales from the huge cotton carry-over in the Government’s warehouses. At the moment of writing, also, the plan is being extended in another and even more significant direction. In Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, non-relief families with incomes of less than $19.50 a week are to be allowed to buy the stamps. As Chart III shows, Oklahoma has the lowest standard of relief in the country. The stamp plan is here being used as a means of keeping families from demanding relief, in fact as a substitute for relief. Local officials who don’t make use of it this way will be exceptionally high-minded indeed.






Chart III: Average Relief Given, Per Family, in the 48 States. Date: April, 1939




Source: WPA average monthly wage from recent issues of WPA Statistical Bulletin (payroll for month divided by number of persons on WPA the last week of the month) and US Social Security Bulletin; figures for state relief payments are from Social Security Bulletin for April 1939, table 4, p. 6. Figures are for state and local funds excluding cost of administration, materials, equipment, hospitalizations and burials.
 




Since 1935, the New Deal has been doing its best to shift the entire burden of relief back to the state and local governments, where it rested in the days of Hoover. This year, because of the one-third cut in WPA put through at the suggestion of the White House, 1,000,000 more unemployed families will be thrown back onto local relief.
The responsibility for the increasingly low relief standards throughout the nation rests entirely with the New Deal. Early in 1937, after a nation-wide survey of relief conditions, the American Association of Social Workers reported:

“There can be no doubt that since the Federal government withdrew its aid from the states for direct relief, welfare practices in many areas have deteriorated to pre-depression levels.”

This chart shows the cold statistics just what this statement means. The bars indicate the total relief given in the month of April 1939 to the average family on relief in each of the 48 states. (The numbers represent dollars-per-month.) The chart shows dramatically the enormous differences in local relief standards – New York being about eight times as high as Oklahoma – and also the subhuman level of this sort of relief in general. The bottom bar represents the average WPA wage for that month. It was originally planned to show on this chart some “minimum emergency subsistence” budgets worked out by social agencies, but this proved to be impractical: the very lowest of such budgets, if represented on the same scale as the above payments, would have stretched the chart several inches beyond the edge of this page.






In the fall of 1933, the FERA sent out a questionnaire to the states asking whether they paid relief in cash or in kind. Of the 31 states replying, 28 stated they paid no direct cash relief whatever. [45] One of the great struggles of FERA in those early years of idealistic reformism was to get relief authorities to pay in cash and not in groceries. By 1935 the battle was largely won, and social workers praised the advance. But here, as in other matters, they have become increasingly alarmed at the turn things have lately taken. The brutal truth is that the mildest sort of reformist progress has by now become a luxury which the New Deal cannot politically afford. The ultimate effect of the food stamp plan promises to be to fasten on the unemployed once more the grocery-basket relief of Hooverian years. But the plan is the kind of recovery measure with relief trimmings that has always been the favorite approach of the Administration to the unemployment problem. And it is by its usefulness to farm prices and to the food trade rather than to the unemployed that it will be judged. In the frank words of a Washington news service for business men: “Idea of plan is primarily to help farmers dispose of crops, secondarily to feed the unemployed.”
* * *
But the stamp plan is not the chief future worry of the unemployed. Far more serious is the clearly expressed determination of the New Deal to throw the whole relief problem back into the laps of the states and communities whence it was plucked in 1933. Already, as we have seen, great progress has been made in this direction. The 1939–1940 WPA bill will add another 1,000,000 employables to the local relief rolls before the winter is out. This survey of New Deal relief policies – especially of their future trend – may therefore well conclude with an examination of two points.

What has happened, in the last few years to the increasing numbers of unemployed who have been recommitted to the care of local governments?
 
What are the main reasons why only the Federal Government can cope adequately with unemployment relief?

There is copious evidence as to the first question. A little of it is briefly reviewed below.
 
New Jersey, 1936
The classic example of the effects of Federal withdrawal from relief activities is what happened in New Jersey in the summer of 1936. By the beginning of the year, all Federal relief funds had been withdrawn. The state legislature set up a state relief organization, which functioned for a few months. But in April the State senate refused to vote any funds and turned the state’s 270,000 unemployed over entirely to the care of local governments. A month later, the NY Times made a survey of the results. Its findings – which the Times, of course, found admirable – may be summarized:
Trenton: Rolls cut from 3,682 cases to 1,602, cost per month from $102,000 to $30,000. “Nearly all the people we had to drop took it philosophically,” said the welfare supervisor.
Camden: 4,630 cases cut to 2,856. Relief director: “We’re going after the chisellers.”
Atlantic City: 3,105 cases cut to 1,700. Relief director: “We gave every case dropped a two weeks food order, telling them it was to be their last. Almost all of them took it for granted the city could not afford to support them. ‘We’ll try to get along somehow, at least through the summer,’ they would say.”
Williamstown: Relief per family $1 to $2 a week. Case of worker with silicosis, his wife and his two kids “living” on $2 a week.
Hoboken: 2,000 cases cut to 90. City poormaster, Barck, 71 years old: “I’m in favor of giving the old American pioneer spirit a chance to assert itself.” (In February 1938, Barck met his death at the hands of Joseph Scutellaro, an unemployed mason, who plunged a letter-spike into Barck’s heart when the poormaster refused relief and suggested Scutellaro’s young wife could make money on the streets.)
The American Association of Social Workers also looked into New Jersey relief that summer and added a few touches to the picture: Many towns gave no relief to single men, none to families resident less than five years ... Food budgets were cut in half in most places, with no money for rent, clothing, medical care, gas and electricity. ... Some towns solved the problem by issuing licenses to beg to all unemployed ... Others put them at forced labor, or turned them over to local sweatshops, at low wages ... Many “poormasters” – the term suggests the Elizabethan antiquity of the relief set-up here, as in many other states – fed their charges exclusively on surplus commodities distributed free by the FSCC. Typical ration for two weeks for a family of three: one package peas, six cans beef, one jar jam, one package prunes, six cans evaporated milk, one package oatmeal ... The Association concluded: “New Jersey is experimenting with slow starvation for relief recipients.” [46]
 
Pennsylvania, 1936
For three months in the spring of 1936, the Pennsylvania legislature was deadlocked on the question of relief. Early in July, in the midst of the deadlock, funds ran out completely. For nine days no relief was paid in the state. Another legislative tie-up at the end of the month cut off all relief for ten more days. The Philadelphia Non-partisan Committee on Relief investigated to see how the unemployed got through these periods. The NY Times of August 2, 1936, reported:
The survey disclosed that 67% of those cut off from relief “eked out subsistence through peddling, begging or scavenging, or pawning articles of clothing and carefully husbanded possessions” and that 25.2% were “about equally divided between dependence upon already overburdened private agencies, relatives, friends and neighbors in only slightly more fortunate circumstances, and upon food orders distributed by the police stations” ... About one-fourth of the families had some current income, averaging $3.78 per week per family ... In three-fourths of the cases there was no such income ... “Many ate surplus Federal commodities, consisting of flour, beef and beans.”
The committee announced that its conclusion was similar to that reached by the Community Council of Philadelphia which, after a like study in 1932 when 52,000 families were “off relief” for more than ten weeks, asserted that “people do not starve to death when relief stops. They just starve, with a margin by which life persists maintained by the pity of their neighbors and by a sort of scavenging on the community.”
“Although relief has been resumed ... families have mortgaged their future existence: scanty supplies of Winter clothing will have to be replaced; tools sold for food will have to be repurchased and debts will have to be repaid ... The effect on their mental state cannot be expressed in measurable terms.”
 
Chicago, 1938
In the spring of 1938, the legislatures of Ohio and of Illinois failed to vote relief funds. The basic cause was the same in both cases: the hostility of the dominant rural and small-town bloc to the increasing relief needs of the big cities. In Cleveland and Chicago, relief for a period of months broke down completely. A single news item will give some idea of just what this meant to the unemployed:
Chicago, May 21: The second largest city in this country, Chicago, has followed Cleveland, the sixth largest, into relief bankruptcy ... 93,000 families – 270,000 persons – have been receiving direct relief in Chicago. 69,000 of those families, those whose names begin with the letters “A” through “NUT”, received their May checks before the funds ran out. 34,000 families whose names fall between the letters “NUU” and “Z” can receive no aid until some action is taken by the legislature ... Meanwhile, relief stations are distributing small quantities of foodstuffs from the Federal Surplus Commodities Corp. ... This is a typical handout for a relief family in Chicago today: 5 cents worth of dry beans, 29 cents of butter, 9 cents of cabbage, 6½ cents of celery, 5 cents of rice, and 9 cents of prunes – 60½ cents worth. This, plus another 55 cents worth later in the month is to last an average family of three persons until June ... In Cleveland the situation is worse because it has been going on longer, since the end of April ... Governor Henry Homer of Illinois and Mayor Burton of Cleveland had made the identical statement: “No one will be allowed to starve.” [47]
Note: On May 19, WPA Administrator Harry Hopkins said: “No one is going to starve. The legislatures will take care of that.” They did.
 
Texas, 1939
The New Republic for March 22, 1939, printed a letter from a social worker in Texas:
Now they’re talking about dropping the WPA and substituting direct relief. That will mean a lot of starving people here in the South ... Texas gives no direct relief except old-age assistance (partly Federal funds) ... I do not know of any county that gives more than emergency aid to employment cases. This sort of aid may be about a dollar a month for staples such as sugar, salt, coffee. Surplus commodities are the only foodstuffs given ... The WPA in Texas and in the South as a whole is the only source of aid for able-bodied workers ... When I was in the Dallas district two weeks ago, a woman with children had killed herself because she was refused assignment to a sewing project In the East Texas district over 24,000 families were awaiting assignment to the WPA. Last year in Washington County, Mississippi, the richest county in the state, the average monthly payment for old-age assistance was $3.71 ... The old-age clients in Greenville, the county seat, were sent to a soup kitchen supported by Sunday movie benefits. There they could get soup and bread twice a day and take some home for the other meal if they brought a bucket.
 
Why the States Cannot Handle Relief
It is depressing that, at this late date, after all the experience piled up since 1929, it is still necessary to demonstrate the elementary fact that only the Federal Government can give adequate relief to the unemployed. The recent policy of the New Deal, however, makes it necessary to give, in the briefest outline, the reasons why the states and communities cannot, even if they would, cope with unemployment relief. There are roughly five major reasons:

The states lack the financial resources.
 
The smaller the political subdivision, the more likelihood relief funds will be used for political ends.
 
The smaller the subdivision, the more incompetent the administration of relief.
 
State legislatures are even more responsive to anti-relief pressure from business and rural interests than is Congress and the Administration.
 
Above all, unemployment is a nationwide phenomenon, and relief can only be equitably and efficiently administered on a national scale.







Chart IV: New Deal Into War Deal



 

This chart shows, in simplified form, the trend of relief as against naval and military expenditures of the New Deal from its birth up to the present. No commentary is necessary.
It should be explained that the fiscal year of 1933–1934 is taken as 100, and the trends of all three lines are shown in index numbers on that as a base.




Sources: national defense expenditures are limited to specific army and navy expenditures, and are taken from annual Budgets of US Govt, except for 1939–1940, which are appropriations voted to date as listed in NY Times, August 6, 1939; relief figures are from US budgets, NY Times, and Report on Progress of the WPA Program, June 30, 1938.






(1) Three-quarters of all state and local revenues come from general property taxes, almost wholly on real-estate. Since this form of property has been especially hard hit by the depression, tax assessments have had to be cut down and tax delinquencies have been common. During the 1929–1935 decline, 3,000 local governments defaulted on their debts. Many more have undoubtedly joined them in bankruptcy since the 1937 slump. This means forced economies in all services – not only relief but also schools, police, even garbage collecting. (Chicago, which has been bankrupt for years, is the classic example.) The one big source of revenue still open to states and communities for raising relief funds is the general sales tax, already used for that purpose in New York City and many other places. This is the kind of tax, of course, that bears most heavily on the masses. [48]
(2) For all the reactionary cry of “politics in relief!”, there has been remarkably little of it in either FERA, CWA or WPA It is the state, city, and county machines that make relief into a political football. The Earle administration in Pennsylvania, for example, used relief funds freely in the 1938 state elections. In Luzerne County, 12,000 road-making jobs were given out a few weeks before election day. An engineer later testified, in court, that 368 would have been an “adequate” working force. [49] After their votes had been registered, the unemployed, of course, were laid off wholesale. According to official state figures, 162,764 relief checks were issued on the weekly pay day falling on November 4, 1938, and 51,887 on the next pay day, November 11. Election day was November 8. [50]
(3) The number and complexity of local government units often make it impossible to organize relief sensibly. Each one of the 1,400 townships in Illnois runs its own relief system, completely independently of the other 1,399. [51] Sometimes a relief family on one side of a street will get twice as much milk for its baby as a family across the way in another county. Local relief officials are generally political appointees. A survey made in 1934 of the 425 poor districts in Pennsylvania showed that not a single one of the 967 persons in charge of them had any training whatsoever in social work. One third of them were farmers. [52]
“Persons recruited for the disbursing of relief in this period of purely local control,” reads another report, “were as a rule not adequate for the job. In one county, an ex-deputy sheriff was named ‘case supervisor’ ... because he was said to ‘know every one in the county.’ His method of checking up on applicants for relief was unique. He drove his car as far as the hard roads made going easy, then blew his horn. Every one came running.” [53]
(4) State legislatures usually will put to shame the most reactionary Congress on the matter of relief. The role which the Southern Democrats play in Congress on the relief issue is played in these legislatures – and usually even more effectively – by representatives from the country districts. The rural population doesn’t understand the need for relief. Mentally still living in the world of the unexhausted frontier, the farmers believe the unemployed don’t work because they are shiftless, and so they strongly object to supporting the unemployed. In states like Texas and Oklahoma where the rural counties completely dominate, relief standards are unbelievably low. (See Chart III.) In the big cities, where social thought is more advanced and where the unemployed are more organized and articulate, relief standards are higher. In states like Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania the unemployed often get the worst of both worlds: unemployment is a serious problem because of the many urban, industrialized areas, and yet relief funds are voted by a legislature often controlled by the farming districts. The result is such chronic collapses of relief as are described above.
(5) But these are all minor points compared to the fact that, in this period of monopoly capitalism, the American economy is integrated nationally, not locally. The economic forces that produce unemployment operate on a national scale. At the same time, there are the most tremendous variations between different communities as to both the amount of unemployment and the resources available for its relief. Unemployment varies widely at any given time between different industries. In September, 1937, for instance, 8% of the workers in manufacturing were idle, as against 24% in mining, 42% in construction, and 26% in fishing and forestry. [54] It is not surprising, therefore, to find wide variations also between different parts of the country. The 1937 unemployment census showed that unemployment was much more severe in New England, the Middle Atlantic states and the South than in the rest of the country. [55] The Middle Atlantic states have the wealth to cope with relief, but the South has not. In 1931 the national average of taxable wealth was $1961 per capita. In ten Southern states, it was less than 1,000. The taxable wealth in the richest state was about five times that in the poorest. [56] In the light of such statistics, it is not surprising to find that community A often has three times the relief load and half the resources to meet it with that community B has. As Chart III shows, this spring the average family in Oklahoma got $4 in relief a month, while the average New York family got $37. But the Oklahoma family was just as hungry as the New York family. Only a Federally financed and administered relief system will level out such inequities. The New Deal has gathered into the hands of the Federal government unprecedentedly wide powers to deal with interstate crime, to regulate various parts of the economic system, to control the radio, the courts, the whole fabric of social life. To this trend – an inevitable and long overdue development – there has been one great exception. The New Deal, as we have seen, for years has been shoving the relief problem ever more insistently back onto the states and communities. The more it is permitted to do so, the more desperate will become the plight of the unemployed.

SECTION II:
New Deal Relief, 1933–1938
Enter the New Deal
It must be confessed that, compared to Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt in the early years of the New Deal appears as a veritable St. George on a white horse galloping with streaming banners to the rescue of the unemployed. When he took office on March 4, 1933, the number of unemployed stood at an all-time high of 17,500,000. The relief system had broken down as disastrously as the banking system – though the front-page headlines went to the sufferings of the bankers rather than of the unemployed. As Governor of New York, Roosevelt had taken public issue with Hoover, insisting that relief was a state responsibility. (Hoover had taken the position that it was immoral for any political subdivision larger than a county to take official notice of unemployment.) The Governor had backed up his word by getting the state legislature to pass the Wicks Bill, which in 1931 set up for New York the first of the state relief organizations. Great things were therefore expected of the new President.
Under White House leadership, Congress passed the Federal Emergency Relief Act, appropriating $500,000,000 to be given as Federal grants-in-aid to the states to help finance their relief programs. The President signed the bill on May 12, 1933. As administrator of the FERA he appointed Harry Hopkins, a professional social worker, who had been head of the New York relief organization.
For all this show of action, actual relief expenditures somehow lagged. By August 21, three months after FERA had been established and almost six months after Roosevelt had taken office, only $139,000,000 had been given out in grants. [8] The fact is that the real interest of the President and his advisers, then as later, was not in relief but in recovery. Their approach has never been based on the needs of the unemployed but rather on what they would call “positive measures to restore prosperity”.
The ragged, hungry masses of the unemployed present a problem which, it has long been evident, bores and irritates the genial master of the White House. This imputes no exceptional heartlessness to the President. He is a humanitarian over the radio – and also, no doubt, in his personal life – but his primary political task is to make capitalism “work”. He knows quite well that unless he does this, the votes of the unemployed will be of no use to him, and that if he does it, he won’t need them. The second proposition he illustrated clearly enough by drastically cutting WPA at the first sign of an upturn in 1936. He has, therefore, preferred to treat unemployment with recovery rather than relief measures. An advantage or a disadvantage of this system – depending on one’s point of view – is that when the recovery measures blow up, as they always do, the unemployed are the chief victims of the explosion. An example is the recent defeat by Congress of the Administration’s lending-spending program. The President now claims that he had suggested the one-third cut in WPA only because the spending program – a “positive recovery measure” – would give jobs to those dropped from WPA But Congress accepted his WPA cut and rejected his spending program, leaving the unemployed holding the bag as usual.
On June 16, 1933, the President signed the bill which really appealed to him and his advisers as a way of meeting the unemployment problem: the National Industrial Recovery Act, significantly described by New Dealers as “essentially an employment measure”. This firstborn of the prolific breed of New Deal white rabbits was divided into NRA and PWA: while private industry was regulating itself back to prosperity under the Blue Eagle, the Public Works Authority was supposed to prime the pump with a $3,300,000,000 public works program. The theory was that for every job on PWA, two jobs would be created in the industries supplying its materials. The President hopefully described PWA as “a bridge over which men may pass from relief to normal employment”.
 
The Magic Beanstalk: CWA
But the Blue Eagle laid an egg and the PWA bridge never reached the other side of the abyss. As the fifth winter of the depression approached, it became clear that a more direct attack on unemployment was necessary. Some left-wing advisers persuaded the President that a big work relief program, giving millions of men quick jobs on projects requiring little expenditure for materials, would turn the trick which PWA had flubbed. They were aided by the most renowned advocate of this particular panacea for capitalist ills, the English economist, J.M. Keynes, who visited the White House and made a deep impression on Roosevelt. On November 8, 1933, the President set aside $400,000,000 of PWA funds to be used by a new agency, the Civil Works Administration, which would be run by Hopkins and his FERA organization.
The CWA was much the most generous and humane of all New Deal relief programs. (It is significant that it was sold to the President as a recovery rather than a relief measure.) By the middle of January, 1934, 4,000,000 men were working on CWA projects throughout the country. Half were drawn from FERA-financed state work relief rolls, the other half were from the ranks of the unemployed not on relief. It was the first and last time that a Federal work program provided jobs for workers without requiring them first to pauperize themselves in order to get on local relief rolls. Prevailing wages were paid for a full-time working week, not the “security wage” that came in later with WPA Finally, FERA continued to help the states provide for the millions who were unemployable or who could not be accommodated on CWA.
During these winter months of 1933–1934, relief was being given to 27,750,000 men, women and children, or over one-fifth the population. This was an all-time high. It was reached then not because the need was greatest – it had been greater a year earlier and would be greater in the winter of 1937–1938 – but because for a few months the New Deal had a program which came somewhere near providing for all the unemployed who needed relief. This modest standard was never again achieved.
Social workers and relief administrators throughout the country hailed CWA as a great step forward. “I shall never forget,” writes one, “the tremendous enthusiasm with which it was greeted and the inspiring meeting held in Washington on November 15, 1933, when it was launched.” [9] President Roosevelt addressed the gathering and in moving terms described CWA as aimed especially at all who were “too proud to go and ask for relief”. As a recovery measure, however, CWA soon proved much too expensive. Worse yet. “many employers objected that the wages paid by the Government were attracting men from private industry”. [10] On February 28, 1934, therefore, three months after the “inspiring meeting”, the President announced that CWA was to be liquidated as quickly as possible. Evidently the Presidential sympathy for those “too proud to ask for relief” had evaporated. In the future, indeed, millions who asked for relief with no pride at all were to find it impossible to get.
Within a week 52,000 letters and 7,000 telegrams inundated the White (House and FERA headquarters protesting the destruction of CWA. Unemployed demonstrations took place all over the country. For months an average of one delegation a week called on Harry Hopkins to ask for the restoration of CWA. [11] Nor was Hopkins in any doubt as to what his fellow social workers thought about this move. William Hodson, now relief commissioner for New York City, expressed himself thus:
I say it was a tragedy when the Federal Government abandoned the CWA program on March 31, 1934. It is true that the President had announced the program as temporary in nature; nevertheless the people of the country believed that civil works would be carried on and tapered off gradually as the employment index rose and people could leave civil works employment for jobs in regular industry. This was not to be and the sudden transition from work and wages without a needs test, to work relief on the basis of destitution was a bitter shock to the unemployed. [12]
C.W. Bookman, executive secretary of the Cincinnati Community Chest, had this to say:
Probably the most serious defect of the CWA was the hope it built up in the hearts of millions of unemployed, and then dashed to earth, that at last a job at a reasonable wage was to be provided for them by their government until such time as industry could reemploy them ... It was a serious thing to destroy the confidence and break down the morale of ten to twelve million people who, through no fault of their own, had endured four years of privation and want. [13]
Serious or not, the Administration did it. Up to this point, social workers had endorsed the New Deal in relief with whole-hearted and rather naive enthusiasm. The junking of CWA was a terrible shock to them. More shocks were to follow. The attitude of the National Conference of Social Work and the American Association of Social Workers became increasingly disillusioned, critical, even hostile as the New Deal relief policies came to have an ever more Hooverian coloration. Politically unsophisticated, they did not understand what speedily became crystal clear to the President: that the unemployed were a political liability rather than an asset. Once this great truth had dawned on the Administration, it acted with characteristic decision. CWA was liquidated with brutal rapidity. In February, 3,216,000 workers were on its rolls. In April, there were 38,000 left. The beanstalk had grown up overnight and was chopped down at one stroke.
Those CWA workers who could qualify as paupers went back to state and local relief, financed mostly by FERA The rest had to wait until they had exhausted all their resources before they were allowed the privilege of home relief. After the rosy dream of CWA, this was bad enough. But something much worse was coming.
 
“This Business of Relief”
In his annual message to Congress of January 4, 1935, President Roosevelt outlined a new relief policy. When the Federal government had taken over the major responsibility for relief in 1933, the move had been universally popular. The breakdown of local relief had gone so far that many conservatives feared actual revolution. The states and communities welcomed Federal funds as, in many cases, the only way to escape bankruptcy. But as conditions improved, the right wing demanded more and more insistently that the Federal credit be no longer used to support the unemployed. What had been a universally popular program in 1933, two years latter had become a sore spot, a vulnerable point in New Deal policies. And relief, unlike the Neutrality Act or the Supreme Court reorganization, is not the kind of an issue on which the White House will put up a fight.
It was reported that the President’s new program “had been laid down at a conference in December 1934 of the National Industrial Conference Board and the National Association of Manufacturers, representing business and banking leadership in the United States. These leaders had demanded an end to relief from the Federal Treasury and that where work was provided it should be paid for at less than the normal rate of wages in order that there might be no incentive to remain in public work rather than to seek private employment”. [14] On the relief issue, as on so many others, big business joined hands with the Congressional spokesmen for the backward South and with the forces of rural and small-town conservatism throughout the nation. (Any one who follows the Gallup and Fortune polls must be struck with the similarity of political sentiment shown by the wealthy and the farmers.) Pressure of this sort was more than a reformist Administration could resist, especially since no comparable pressure was ever exerted from the left on the relief issue. The keynote of the President’s 1935 message, and of all subsequent New Deal relief policy, was his blunt statement: “The Federal Government must and shall quit this business of relief.”
The President’s new program sounded reasonable enough. He put the total number of heads-of-families on relief at 5,000,000. Of these, he estimated that 1,500,000 were “unemployable” because of age or other disabilities. These he proposed to turn over to the state and local governments, without any aid from the Federal Treasury. The remaining 3,500,000 “employables” were to be given jobs on a gigantic new $4,000,000,000 Federal work relief program, which began to take shape in the spring of 1935 as the WPA (Workers Progress Administration). Thus the Federal Government got out of relief, as demanded by business, and provided jobs instead of the dole, as demanded by the unemployed. But the 3,500,000 jobs in practise turned out to be an illusion. That figure was approached only twice in the history of WPA, and the average in its four years of operation has been closer to 2,000,000. The White House has consistently tried to reduce the WPA rolls, purging hundreds of thousands of WPA workers every time the slightest business upturn gave an excuse. The one-third slash now being made in the rolls at the request of the President, on the grounds of a microscopic rise in the business index, is merely the latest of a long series.
But even had WPA provided the 3,500,000 jobs promised by the President, it would still have been grossly inadequate. At the time the program was first announced in 1935 there were 12,000,000 employable workers out of a job, and almost 7,000,000 households on the relief rolls. Thus the effect of the new program was to formally disavow Federal responsibility for the great majority of the unemployed, and to throw these millions back onto the streets and communities for support. Up to 1935, three-fourths of the nation’s relief bill had been paid by the Federal Treasury, through FERA’s grants-in-aid to the states. From now on, the unemployed were divided into a minority on WPA and a great majority, getting on the average about $25 a month per family to live on as against the $50 average WPA pay. From now on, WPA came to be regarded as simply a big employer, like the US Steel Corp., which hired and fired workers as the fluctuations of business conditions – in this case, the political interests of the New Deal – dictated. From now on, the communities struggled to keep the bulk of the unemployed alive, and since their financial resources were inadequate, the result was a nation-wide drop in relief standards and a return in large areas to the misery and chaos of Hooverian days.
There were also several minor jokers in the new program, whose rich humor the unemployed slowly came to appreciate.
1. One of the scandals of Hooverism had been its refusal of all help to the masses of men and boys whom the depression set wandering about the country, looking for work. The New Deal at once accepted responsibility for transient relief – obviously a job that could be done only by the Federal government – and put into effect an intelligent and humane program. This was now tossed out the window.
“In September, 1935, the order was issued to the states to close intake at the transient treatment centers and camps and to liquidate the entire program as of November first. The transient, unsettled person was to become the ‘forgotten man’ of the New Deal, as he had been of the old ... The stream of transient flow was driven underground. We had returned to the chaos of March, 1933.” [15]
The sufferings of the people described in Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath are a dramatic illustration of what has happened to the transients.
2. There was no provision for increasing WPA pay to provide for big families – though it was supposed to be a “security wage”. It was calculated that workers with more than three dependents were better off under home relief, which allowed extra money for more children, than under WPA There were many cases of real suffering in large families whose head had been forced to take a WPA job, under pain of losing relief altogether.
“The transfer from work relief to WPA,” writes a social worker, “means the complete abandonment of the family wage on relief operations, which was one of the most enlightened procedures developed under FERA” [16]
It is an indication of the remoteness of the WPA administration from the living needs of the unemployed that this injustice, neither difficult nor expensive to rectify, has remained unchanged down to the present.
3. The best joke of all, however, one so good the President repeated it this spring, was what WPA did – or rather, attempted to do – about wage rates. This deserves a section to itself.
 
The 1935 Strike
The first event in the life of the newborn WPA was a strike which offers some instructive parallels and contrasts to the 1939 WPA strike. CWA had given full-time work at prevailing wage rates. Its successor, the Emergency Work Relief program of FERA, had kept the prevailing wage principle, but had cut down the hours of the highly paid workers so that they were able to earn only a “security wage”. That is to say, skilled workers were paid at union rates, but were given only a third or a half as many hours work per month as the unskilled workers. Business had long been pressing for the abandonment of the prevailing wage principle on relief jobs.
In his WPA message, the President said:
“Compensation ... should be in the form of security payments which should be larger than the amount now received as a relief dole but at the same time not so large as to encourage the rejection of opportunities for private employment.”
The unions tried to get Congress to attach to the WPA bill the McCarran amendment, stipulating that prevailing wages were to be paid. The New Deal forces killed this amendment, but permitted a “compromise”: the whole question of wage rates was to be left up to the President.
Just what this compromise was worth and just how loyal a friend of labor was the great humanitarian in the White House – these matters became clear as the WPA program was launched that summer. From the White House came the categorical order: security wages, without reference to prevailing rates of pay, were to be paid on all WPA projects. In New York City, where the first attempt was made to get WPA into operation, this meant that the wages of common labor rose from $50 to $55 a month, while hours of work rose from 96 to 120 a month. Skilled workers were even worse off: their wages rose 50% (from $61 to $93.50), their hours increased 130% (from 48 to 120).
The first Emergency Work Relief projects were transferred to WPA in New York City on August 5, 1935. Before their unions had taken formal action, bricklayers, ironworkers, plasterers, plumbers, and other skilled workers began walking out on the job. General Hugh Johnson, WPA administrator for New York, flew down to Atlantic City to plead with the AFL leadership to call off the strike. (It is interesting to note how much more seriously the New Deal took this strike than the 1939 strike: Johnson appealed frantically to the leaders and the rank and file, in person and on the radio; whereas his successor, Colonel Somervell, didn’t trouble to make more than routine press releases throughout the strike.) The strike continued to grow. On August 9, the Central Trades and Labor Council, after a formal strike vote, made it official.
The backbone of resistance to the strike was clearly located in the White House. Johnson was known to have been against the new wage policy. “Labor doesn’t like it and I don’t like it,” he said, adding correctly: “It’s going to give me a lot of headaches.” [17] He was badly heckled by the Trades Council when he appeared before it with a last-minute plea hot to vote the strike.
“The union delegates challenged his statements, his logic and arguments. They cited things he had said while NRA administrator in support of the prevailing wage rate, and asked why he had changed his mind.” [18]
Since he hadn’t changed his mind, the General found such questions hard to answer. Mayor LaGuardia, also, was in an obviously uncomfortable position.
“I can’t see how there should be a strike on relief jobs,” he said on August 7. “But after all, we’re living in a free country. You can’t make any one work if he doesn’t want to work.” [19]
But there was never any question as to the attitude of the President. On August 10 he came out publicly against the strike, with the usual You-Can’t-Strike-Against-the-Government line. He took swift steps to implement his words: WPA administrators were authorized to recruit scabs through the National Re-Employment Service; and an executive order forbade the use of Federal funds for home relief to WPA strikers. [20] Since from half to three-quarters of every community’s relief funds came from FERA, and since no separate accounting was practical, this meant that it was almost impossible to pay relief to strikers. Even so, it was not until August 15, after two weeks of evasion and indecision, that LaGuardia dared to announce that strikers would not receive city relief. (In 1939, he made this announcement on the first day of the strike.)
The course of the strike was a curious one. On August 13 the papers jubilantly announced its complete collapse.
“Among the membership of the striking unions,” commented the NY Times, “the ‘work-or-starve’ order of President Roosevelt was described as having broken the strike spirit before it spread widely.”
For a month, the strike dropped almost completely out of the press. In spite of the efforts of the then militant Workers Alliance to arouse the unskilled workers, the strike never approached a mass movement. The unions stuck to it persistently, however, and on September 18, Johnson, admitting he had not been able to get the program up to capacity, hinted at a concession on the wage principle. The Administration had not even tried to launch WPA projects on any large scale in the rest of the country. Two days later, Hopkins, after negotiations with President Meany of the New York Federation of Labor, authorized state administrators to adjust wages – by cutting hours per month – as seemed best to them. If this was not, as the NY Times labelled it in an indignant editorial, “a complete capitulation to the demands of union leaders”, it meant at least that the status quo as of before WPA had been restored. WPA, like FERA, would pay union wages wherever the unions were strong.
In 1936 the AFL was able to get Congress to write into the WPA bill a definite commitment to the prevailing wage principle. Labor’s friend in the White House, however, bided his time patiently. This spring the President took advantage of the reactionary temper of Congress to have his man, Colonel Harrington, urge the Woodrum Committee that prevailing wages be junked. It is still too early to say definitely whether the Administration has finally won its long fight. It has on its side this time two great advantages: the more reactionary political climate in 1939 than in 1935; and the fact that it is much harder to strike successfully against a law passed by Congress than against a mere administrative ruling, such as was overturned by the 1935 strike.
 
Back to Hooverville
Delayed by the strike, the WPA program went ahead slowly. It was not until the end of 1935 that the last of the FERA grants were made, and the Federal government was out of “this business of relief”. In the process of shifting from FERA to WPA, the New Deal did some characteristic chiselling at the expense of the unemployed, by dismantling the old program faster than the new one was built up. “The fine social consciousness which characterized the early days of the New Deal,” lamented the Nation in its most pathetic style, “appears to have faded.” [21] The “fading” brought a more vigorous reaction from the unemployed of Kansas City, who stormed the Wyandotte County court house in August to protest a cut of two-thirds in relief rates.
“The protest,” stated the NY Times, “followed a curtailment in relief funds made necessary by a cut in Federal work relief funds for the county from $225,000 to $80,000 a month, pending start of the WPA program.” (Italics mine.)
The chief effect of the withdrawal of FERA funds – and this was permanent and not temporary – was a return to the chaos, the glaring inequities, and the subhuman relief standards of Hooverian times. The effect on the unemployed, in some ways, was even worse, since a full six years of depression by now had drained dry their last financial resources. But even here the New Deal tried to coin some political capital, by contrasting the declining local relief standards with the relatively high wages paid on WPA! Thus Aubrey Williams, the man whom the sob-sisters of the liberal press talk about in Lincolnesque terms, said proudly:
“By September of this year, the average relief payment had already receded to $25.90 and in some states had sunk to $4.50 a month. Under the work program, on the other hand, the wage payment approximates $50 a month. Thus we have achieved through a work program what two and a half years of a relief program could not accomplish.” [22]
And this was the spokesman for the extreme left wing of the New Deal relief apparatus!
At the end of the year, the American Association of Social Workers conducted, through its chapters throughout the nation, a survey of relief conditions: It reported that the new relief set-up had resulted in “low-grade pauper treatment over wide areas”. Conditions among the millions who couldn’t get onto WPA were worse than they had been at any time since the beginning of the New Deal, and were actually worse than they had been in the last months of the Hoover administration. [23] Another report pointed out that WPA had fallen short by 500,000 of the 3,500,000 jobs promised a year ago by the President. [24]
 
The Purges Begin
The White House answered these criticisms by suggesting to the new Congress that in the fiscal year 1936–1937 WPA could get along on an appropriation of $1,500,000,000, which was $500,000,000 less than would have been needed even to continue it on the low level it reached in 1935. In the first six months of 1936, one out of every five WPA workers was cut off the rolls. This was the first of those recurrent mass purges which have been the most prominent feature of WPA policy. To quote an article in the Saturday Evening Post, of all places:
“The purges are purely arbitrary. Mr. Hopkins orders one when he has an idea the job market will stand it, and if Mr. Hopkins’ idea should ever be wrong, God alone would have to help the reliefers cut off the rolls.” [25]
Another purge took place in the fall. “Mr. Roosevelt is personally responsible for the present attempt to cut 150,000 workers off from the WPA rolls,” wrote the New Republic’s Washington correspondent.
“All sources agree that, during the campaign, he became greatly disturbed over WPA spending. As soon as the votes of the WPA voters were safely counted, he is supposed to have given the order for dismissals.” [26]
In his Baltimore speech of April 29, 1936, the President had for the first time publicly admitted that unemployment looked like a permanent problem. And yet his first post-election speech was an appeal for contributions to the Community Chest drive, expressing the hope that, as prosperity returned, relief would become once more a matter for local charity. The parallel with Hoover was becoming embarrassing.
On November 16, Farley indiscreetly revealed what was in the back of “The Boss’s” mind when he told reporters that WPA was to be liquidated and relief shifted back entirely to the states and communities. By December the WPA rolls had been so deeply cut, with such an alarming rise in local relief rolls as a consequence, that the Conference of American Mayors cabled a desperate appeal to the President, off on a “goodwill” junket tour of South America. [27] Unless the firings were stopped, they threatened to appeal directly to Congress. But the firings went on.






Chart II: How Much Has Roosevelt Asked for Relief? A 4-Year Record




Sources: For amounts asked by various relief groups, NY Times; for amounts actually
appropriated by Congress, the annual Budget of the US Government.
 




The usual apology offered for the New Deal’s relief record is that President Roosevelt has wanted more adequate relief, but that a reactionary Congress has refused to vote him the funds. But how much of a fight has the New Deal actually put up for more generous WPA appropriations? Here is the damning record, in black and white.
The white columns represent the various (WPA appropriations publicly asked for by the reactionary right-wing in Congress (RW), by President Roosevelt (FDR), by Left-Wing New Dealers in Congress (LW), by the Conference of American Mayors, headed by Mayor LaGuardia. of New York City (CM), by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and by the Workers Alliance (WA). The all-black columns show the amounts actually voted by Congress in each instance. It is apparent at a glance that President Roosevelt has generally asked for WPA appropriations only a little higher than the Congressional reactionaries, and considerably below the amounts proposed by even so politically moderate a group as the Conference of Mayors. And in some cases, Roosevelt has actually asked for less than the Congressional right-wing proposed! There are also instances of Roosevelt being forced to revise his original proposals upward – indicated by the figures “1” (for his first proposal), “2”, etc. The chart also shows plainly how much more “reasonable” the demands of the Workers Alliance have become in the last year.
The abbreviation, “D.A.” means “Deficiency Appropriation” – i. e., additional amounts voted by Congress during the fiscal year to supplement the amount originally voted at the beginning of the year. It should be noted that the original appropriation for the last fiscal year (1938-1939) was about the same as the original appropriation for the current fiscal year. But this original sum last year was voted for only the first eight months of the year, and it was expected – as was the case – that further deficiency appropriations would be voted in the course of the year. This year, however, the original sum voted is expressly stipulated to be spent in twelve equal monthly instalments over the entire year. Thus it is unlikely that any additional deficiency appropriations will be voted this winter.







What Happens Afterward
This is a good place for a few words on just what happens to those who are dropped from WPA in these purges, the greatest of which is taking place at this very moment. In asking for a smaller WPA appropriation in 1936, the President used for the first time his by now routine excuse: business is improving, and so those purged will get jobs in private industry. Year after year, this argument has been advanced by the White House. Year after year, it has turned out to be, to put it politely, fallacious. There may be some dispute as to the precise nature of the technological and economic reasons for this – next month we will examine them. But there is little question as to what becomes of those cut off the rolls. A little of the evidence may be cited.
1936: A WPA survey of sample cases “closed for administrative reasons” found that less than 10% of the families averaged three meals a day. Most of them had “somewhat less than two meals a day”, many had only one.
“Fresh meat, eggs, butter, cheese and milk had practically disappeared from their diets ... Most of them were destitute, lacking practically everything required for health and social efficiency. Some lived on food given by friends. Others begged scraps from stores.” [28]
1937: That summer, before the fall slump, 335,000 workers were purged from WPA In New York City 23,700 out of 25,000 purgees applied at once for home relief, and 14,600 were at once placed on the rolls. In Illinois the state relief commission reported an increase of 12,213 cases whereas the normal seasonal trend called for a decline of up to 14,000 cases. In Indianapolis 60% of those laid off applied at once for home relief, in Cleveland and Columbus 75%. A survey made by the NY Post after this purge showed that 1.5% of those dropped had gotten full-time jobs, 10% had part-time jobs, 54% were on home relief, and the rest existing God knows how. [29]
1938: In the fall of 1938, after another purge, the WPA made a study of what had become of those dismissed in five representative cities: Atlanta, Baltimore, St. Louis, New Bedford and San Francisco. The New Republic summarized the findings:
“The average WPA wage over the whole country is $55 a month, which gives no leeway for savings. Thirty days after being dismissed, one-fifth have no income whatever. A fifth are living on friends and relatives, and another fifth are dependent mainly on direct relief. Two-fifths are earning on the average $25 per month from work in private industry, almost entirely, of course, part-time and odd jobs. Three months later the proportion on direct relief has risen to about one-half, and the proportion that has applied is much larger.
“In many parts of the country, direct relief is not available at all. Numerous states refuse relief to any one who is ‘employable’, whether he can get a job or not. A former WPA worker is considered an employable. But even those places which help a dismissed WPA man have only limited funds. (When many are discharged at once – and WPA dismissals are nearly always on that scale – funds run out and a crisis occurs. Then you have conditions like those seen in Chicago recently, where nobody got more than15 per cent of what he needed for clothing, shelter, medicine, etc.” [30]
 
“Homes Without Food”
Early in 1937, as the business index continued to rise, the President had Harry Hopkins announce a further cut of 600,000 by the end of June. This time protests came not only from the Workers Alliance and the Mayors’ Conference, but also from a hastily formed committee of the governors of New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin, who journeyed in a body to the White House to urge that no further cuts be made. The President told them he would give “serious and sympathetic” consideration to their plea.
This last proposal of the great humanitarian in the White House was too much even for the faithful Harry Hopkins to stomach. He obediently announced that 600,000 were to be dropped, but he also testified frankly before a Congressional committee that it would be impossible to cut that many without causing “widespread suffering”. He also made a prophecy which the business boomlet of that very summer was to verify down to the last iota:
“Carefully prepared estimates show that unemployment will approximate 6,500,000 to 7,500,000 in 1937, even with a return to 1929 levels of production. This figure can be taken as a minimum.” [31]
Despite all protests from mayors, governors and his own WPA administrator, the President insisted on carrying out the cut, as may be seen by reference to Chart II. In the spring of 1937, Grace Abbott devoted the presidential address at the National Conference of Social Work to a bitter attack on New Deal relief policy. “The Federal government’s withdrawal from the home assistance program led to the chaos in which we now find ourselves. The whole relief program has collapsed in many areas.” Indignantly she described “the homes without food and without fuel in bitter weather, the children too hungry to go to school, whole families without warm clothing and bedding, the people without provision for medical care, and the evictions that have gone on so relentlessly”. She charged there were “people actually living on nothing but surplus commodities in whole areas”. [32] (On this last, see under Orange Stamps, Blue Stamps on page 282.)
 
The 1937 Slump
Such protests fell on ears even deafer than usual. Business was still on the upgrade, the 1936–1937 boomlet was approaching its climax, and the White House was making political hay while the sun shone by drastically cutting down on all Government expenditures, especially WPA By the fall of 1937, WPA had been reduced to its all-time low. That fall, business started on a nose dive, caused chiefly by the withdrawal of public spending, which for speed and steepness of decline was unprecedented in oar history. The downward curve of WPA collided disastrously with a sharp upward curve of unemployment – see Chart I. Between September 1937 and January 1938 non-agricultural employment dropped from 35,000,000 to 32,200,000. The White House met the crisis in the best Hooverian tradition. For months the WPA rolls were held down to the low figure they had reached just before the crash. The Federal Government, indeed, refused to recognize officially the existence of the decline, except vaguely as “a temporary recession”. Two months after it began, the President, speaking on the radio for the annual Community Chest drive, declared that “the return of prosperity” meant that the Federal Government “will more and more narrow the circle of its relief activities”. Once more he washed his hands of responsibility for the unemployed:
“Although Federal relief activities will have to be curtailed, there must needs be no abatement of state, local and individual relief work. Indeed, local and private activities must be increased.” [33]
By the end of the year, unemployment had grown so serious that the Administration was forced to increase the WPA rolls to 1,950,000 – this figure being 500,000 under the 1936–1937 average, although the need was at least twice as great this winter. On February 10, the President reluctantly asked for a $250,000,000 deficiency appropriation. The CIO had wanted $1,000,000,000 appropriated, the Mayors’ Conference, $400,000,000. “On both sides of the Capitol, the President’s letter was referred to as a ‘conservative’ request.” [34] Between September 1937 and May 1938, 3,300,000 non-agricultural workers lost their jobs; WPA rolls expanded in that period by only 1,300,000, and it took several months of deepening depression to get this modest expansion even started. What this meant in human terms was revealed by a nation-wide survey made by the American Association of Social Workers that winter:
Relief allowances, already below levels necessary to maintain life and health, have been further pared; relief has been made hard to get and difficult to endure ... Relief offices have been closed periodically; new applicants are being refused Family groups which include a so-called employable denied any relief in many sections. Malnutrition common among relief families throughout the country. Children kept from school because of lack of clothing ... Wholesale evictions ... In Chicago an analysis of the clothing needs of 100 men on relief showed 72 without overcoats, 7 without any kind of a jacket, 40 with bad shoes, and 10 without underwear of any kind.” [35]
As it had year after year, the Association recommended that Federal funds be granted to the states for relief, and, also as he had year after year, the President paid no attention to this recommendation.
 
Business Improves – Off with Their Heads!
The preceding fall, before the “recession” had gone very far, the President was reported to have decided to ask for a total WPA appropriation of $1,000,000,000 for 1938–1939. But by the spring of 1938 even the White House didn’t dare to oppose the demand from all quarters for a bigger WPA appropriation. There was a slight improvement in business that summer and fall. At once, the old policy of drastic reduction of WPA was put into force. According to one survey: “From November 1938 to January 1939, WPA wages declined sharply – by nearly 10% in two months – while general relief rose even more sharply – by 19%. Between November and January, 310,000 persons throughout the United States had resigned or were laid off from WPA jobs and were not replaced; during that same period the general relief rolls had increased by more than 241,000 cases. In January 1939, although the total expenditure for relief was less than in November, 1938 – because of shrinkage of WPA expenditures – there were still nearly 23,000,000 persons on relief in more than 7,000,000 families.” [36]

25 Million

Dwight Macdonald
Twenty-five Million of Us

[Introduction]
THERE ARE at the present time in this country between 10,000,000 and 12,000,000 completely unemployed workers and – with their dependents an army of at least 25,000,000 men, women and children. In a social system based on the production and consumption of goods, these twenty-five million – one-fifth of the nation – are excluded from all part in the normal work and life of society. In the most highly rationalized productive system in the world, it is impossible to “find” jobs for one-fifth of the workers. In the richest and most powerful capitalist society in history, one out of every five citizens is a pauper. If he is lucky, his destitution is officially recognized by the state and he and his family are maintained by the state on a level just above starvation. The less fortunate beg, borrow, and steal – if they can. But however they keep themselves alive, or don’t, these twenty-five million have no place in the nation, no value to society. They are outcasts, pariahs, parasites on the body politic.
The great majority of these outcasts will never, under capitalism, find a place in society again. Mass unemployment has been a feature of our capitalism since 1929, nor do most economists see any reasonable prospect for it to be liquidated. Every year half a million new workers enter the job market. Every year technological advances – stimulated rather than discouraged by the “hard times” – raise the productivity of labor to new levels. The business boom of 1936–1937 raised production almost to 1929 levels, without reducing unemployment at any time below 7,000,000.
Several years ago, President Roosevelt and his advisers began to realize that mass unemployment is a permanent feature of American capitalism. The question of relief thus came to take on an entirely different and much grimmer political aspect than it had in the early years of the New Deal. It is no longer a matter of “tiding over” the unemployed until the next period of prosperity sets them afloat again. It is a matter from now on, of providing state sup-
port for them permanently. This explains the unprecedentedly vicious attack the Congressional reactionaries have made this year on relief standards, and also the extreme faintness, to say the least, of the New Deal opposition to this attack. “No other administration measure of equal importance has been so weakly defended,” wrote the New Republic’s Washington correspondent of the 1940 relief bill. For the brutal fact is that the political weight of the unemployed is far from enough to outweigh the bad political effects of the deficits which their support has cost the Federal treasury. All hands in Washington, Republican and Democrats alike, want desperately to get out from under. And the movement to do so – by reducing relief payments once more to Hooverian levels – has made enormous progress since the first of the year.
But mass unemployment, the major social symptom of capitalist decay, is a problem for revolutionary as well as bourgeois politicians. Unemployment is the great splitter of the ranks of the working class. Already antagonism is growing dangerously between the unemployed and the employed, especially those whose jobs are protected by strong unions. Already Father Coughlin and other fascist demagogues are making the same overtures to the unemployed that Hitler so successfully made in Germany. Already the New Deal’s reformist program has gone far along the road to failure which the Weimar Republic trod, with the same disillusioning effects on the masses of the unemployed. Above all, since the first of this year, the political drive of the two major bourgeois parties against relief standards has reached a new and unprecedented stage of intensity. Without an understanding of unemployment and the problems of the unemployed, it will be impossible for any revolutionary party to defeat fascism and bring about socialism in America.
* * *
This article is divided into two sections. Part I, presented here, is a survey of unemployment relief. It traces the development of Federal relief policy from 1929 to 1939, analyzes in detail the relief legislation this year, and considers the political and social implications of the current drift of New Deal relief policy. Part II, which will appear next month [1*], will be devoted to the social, economic and political aspects of unemployment: the future of technological unemployment, the social composition of the unemployed, the role of unemployed organizations like the Workers Alliance, the lessons to be drawn from this summer’s WPA strike, etc.
 
New Deal Relief Enters Its Third Period
The history of New Deal relief policy can be divided into three periods.
The first period lasted from the establishment of the FERA in the spring of 1933 to its liquidation and replacement by WPA at the end of 1935. In this period, when unemployment was still considered a temporary problem – “FERA” stands for “Federal Emergency Relief Administration – and before any great political pressure had developed against Federal relief spending, the New Deal accepted responsibility for all the unemployed, putting up three dollars for relief to every dollar spent by state and local governments. “While it isn’t written in the Constitution,” President Roosevelt declared in 1933, “nevertheless it is the inherent duty of the Federal government to keep its citizens from starving.”
The second period began with the establishment of WPA in 1935 and lasted up to the beginning of this year. The New Deal narrowed its relief responsibilities down to between 1,500,000 and 3,000,000 of the unemployed (the total varying from year to year) to whom it gave WPA jobs, at wages which came to something more than 35% and less than 60% below a “minimum emergency budget” as defined by the WPA itself. The rest of the unemployed – about three-fourths of the total number – were turned back to the states and communities, that is, to a standard of relief compared to which the wretchedly inadequate WPA wage is positively lavish. The keynote of this period was struck in President Roosevelt’s famous pronouncement to Congress early in 1935: “The Federal government must and shall quit this business of relief.” How this can be reconciled with his earlier statement about “the duty of the Federal government to keep its citizens from starving” neither the President nor his many advisers have tried to explain.
In the third period, which began with the opening of Congress in January of this year, the New Deal’s persistent effort to “get out of this business of relief” has been reinforced by a powerful reactionary drive in Congress. The 1940 Federal relief bill, passed by Congress on June 30 and signed by the President a few days later, is a long step toward liquidating WPA and reducing all relief once more to the local-community levels of Hoover’s regime.
Until this year, President Roosevelt has been remarkably successful in concealing from the masses the real nature of the New Deal’s post-1935 relief policies. This was partly because the New Deal appears to be positively lavish compared to the relief standards of Roosevelt’s immediate predecessor. The New Deal has been able to show a rise in average monthly relief payments per family from less than $7 under Hoover to $17.22 by October, 1933, and $30.30 by January, 1935. But there are two important qualifications to be made here.

Since 1935, as this article will copiously demonstrate, both average relief payments and the number on relief have gone down considerably.
 
The longer the depression lasts, the more the savings of the workers are exhausted and the larger, therefore, relief payments must be.

Barring recourse to actual mass starvation, the New Deal had no choice but to greatly increase relief payments. Also, note that, although the 1937 collapse hit the workers after eight years of “hard times”, and hence with even greater impact than the 1929 slump, yet relief rolls increased comparatively little and are at present being drastically reduced again. According to the NY Times of August 21, 1939, the combined home and work relief rolls of New York City on that date stood at the lowest figure since the beginning of 1933.
The other reason the masses have been so slow to wake up to the real direction of New Deal relief policy is the consummate political skill of President Roosevelt. Year after year, he has made speeches dripping with humanitarian sympathy for the unemployed. Just as persistently, though not quite so publicly, he has done his best to keep WPA appropriations down (see Chart II for the record) and ordered Harry Hopkins to purge hundreds of thousands off the rolls at the slightest upturn in business. The New Deal’s left-wing supporters – the liberals, organized labor, even a large section of the unemployed themselves – have listened to the speeches and overlooked the actions. This master of shell-game politics knows just how to use his spiel to divert the crowd’s attention from his deft manipulations.
This year, however, the New Deal has come out so openly against the unemployed that large sections of the masses are beginning to lose faith in Everybody’s Friend in the White House. But if the masses are growing restive, not so the top leadership of their organizations. All the organs of reformism – the liberal weeklies, the CIO News, the New Leader, the Daily Worker – have kept silent about the increasingly open relief-wrecking policy of the New Deal. This has produced a really fantastic situation. When President Roosevelt proposes that 1,000,000 WPA workers be dropped next year, John L. Lewis addresses a militant letter of protest to – Chairman Taylor of the House Appropriations Committee. When the President’s WPA administrator suggests to the Woodrum Committee that the 1940 relief bill abolish the paying of union wages on WPA, the Daily Worker damns – the Woodrum Committee. When the White House assumes leadership of the drive to smash the WPA strike, when the President declares “You can’t strike against the Government” and instructs his Department of Justice to prepare indictments against the strike leaders, the entire liberal and labor press with one mighty voice denounces – the Congressional Tories. The more the right wing presses the New Deal, the more the New Deal gives ground. And the more the New Deal retreats, the more frightened become its left-wing supporters, the more frantically insistent on complete support and the Trotskyist immorality of any criticism of the New Deal which will “divide the ranks” of the hard-pressed forces of righteousness. Practically, however, this policy means that the New Deal these days feels enormous pressure from the right and practically none at all from the left.
The result is that by now the President can hardly be said to be yielding to Tory pressure on the relief issue.
Since 1935, his skirmishes with the Tories on relief have been at best sham battles. But this year he has openly put himself at the head of the “enemy” forces – so openly as to suggest that he is gambling on a European war in the near future to take care of the whole unemployment and relief issue. In the meantime, the unemployed millions are rubbing their heads and wondering what hit them. In truth, they were ganged up on by one of the most formidable coalitions in our political history, ranging from the bureaucracy of the CIO and the Workers Alliance through the White House to the “Republicrats” in Congress. Every actor has played his appropriate role in the tragi-comedy. Unless the unemployed come to realize that in this cast the ostensible heroes are really the worst villains of all, the play will not have a happy ending. It is one of the purposes of this article to help along this process of enlightenment.

Twenty-five Million of Us

SECTION III:
Relief in 1939, the Year of Transition
Thus the New Deal entered on 1939, its relief policy more definitely set than ever towards the weakening and eventual complete liquidation of WPA But now the reactionary bloc in Congress took the ball out of the President’s hands. There was no basic difference in policy: what the New Deal had been doing, gradually and in a left-handed way, the Congressional Tories, unhampered by the need for any idealist-reformist false front, now proposed to do openly and speedily. For a few months there was a remarkable sham battle, with the President making political capital out of a pretense of defending WPA against the inhumane onslaughts of the Tories. But the New Deal generalship in Congress was, understandably, half-hearted, and the Tories inflicted some embarrassing defeats on the Administration. The President finally put an end to the comedy in his relief message of April 27, in which he openly joined the enemy, asking for a WPA appropriation so low as to arouse no opposition even from the Republicans.
The comedy was good while it lasted. Every one from the Workers Alliance to the “Republicrats” played their parts to perfection. The following chronology will give some idea of its richness.
JANUARY
3. Senator Carter Glass strikes the keynote of Congressional action on relief: “Whatever is asked for relief will be three times too much.” [37]
4. “The November plans of the White House advisers to shift WPA funds and workers to munitions-making have been reluctantly given up as impracticable. However, they have not been wholly scrapped ... It is still hoped that the WPA may be used.” – T.R.B. in the New Republic, Jan. 4, 1939.
13. For the first time in the history of the New Deal, the House cuts a relief appropriation asked for by the President. To make up the deficiency in funds for the rest of the fiscal year (through June 30), the President asked $875,000,000. This inadequate sum the House reduces to $726,000,000, by a vote of 226 to 137. The session lasted eight hours, and the jokes bandied back and forth “filled the House with merriment in probably the most colorful sitting of that body in years”. The “Republicrats” took over entire control of the session, shouting down all liberalizing amendments and writing into the act whatever struck their fancy. One successful amendment – thrown out of the final bill by the Senate – denied WPA jobs “to any person who attempted to influence the political opinion of another”. When the time came for a final vote on the measure as a whole, and the Speaker asked if any one wanted a separate roll-call on any amendment, not a voice was raised on the Democratic side of the House. “A gasp of astonishment went up from the crowded galleries.” The New Deal had served notice it would not even go through the motions of fighting on the relief issue.
16. Ralph Hetzel, unemployment director of the CIO, springs into action with a call to all CIO locals to – write letters to their Congressmen.
18. The Senate committee on appropriations considers the President’s $878,000,000 deficiency request. Borah makes a more militant appeal than the President or any New Deal leader has ventured:
“I am for economy, but there are plenty of places to cut Federal appropriations without taking it out of the hides of poor, helpless people on relief. Many of them are now living like beasts, hundreds of thousands of them ... Here they are, proposing to drop 200,000 people in the dead of winter, and 200,000 more when the cold March winds are blowing. God knows what these people are going to do, unless they starve ... When the armaments bill comes along, there will be no close figuring.”
David Lasser, president of the Workers Alliance, wants to know: “Is the majority of this Congress trying deliberately to provoke a situation of social disorder?” The possibility seems to worry him.
19. Colonel Harrington estimates the WPA rolls will have to be cut one-third before July if the House’s $728,000,000 is permitted to stand.
The Social Security Board releases figures showing a 4% increase in relief cases between November and December 1938.
A heavy snowstorm hits Washington. It is reported that many Congressmen are wavering in their feeling that relief should be cut.
20. Ralph Hetzel issues a bulletin: a “preliminary survey” by his staff shows that a majority of Senators favor the President’s miserably inadequate WPA figure to the House’s wretchedly inadequate figure. This seems to Mr. Hetzel to be glad tidings. Nothing is said about the $1,050,000,000 originally asked by the CIO.
21. The Senate appropriations committee votes, 17 to 7, for the House figure.
22. The Workers Alliance announces that over 500,000 members and sympathizers will parade throughout the nation next Saturday to protest against the Congressional cuts. (N.B. Parades fail to materialize, on account of rain or something.)
23. David Lasser writes a letter to each and every Senator. Comrade Lasser is hurt because his testimony before a Senate committee last week was deleted from the printed record. “We regret ... It is our feeling ... If the committee had informed me that my statement was awkwardly put, I would have been glad to clarify it.” (N.B. No one asks him to “clarify”.)
26. Ralph Hetzel issues a clarion call for more postcards to Congress. Mr. Hetzel: “The tide seems to be turning.”
27. The tide turns – backwards. The Senate votes, 47–46, for the House figure. The vote is apparently a terrible shock to Majority Leader Barkley, who had promised the President victory by at least five votes. Barkley had been so sure of winning that he had allowed Senator Thomas to use up all the New Deal’s debating time with a speech on the silver issue. By now, such bungling – if bungling it was – in the handling of the New Deal’s relief bills in Congress has come to be taken for granted. Relief somehow is not an issue that brings out the best efforts of New Deal parliamentarians ... The importance of the relief issue is shown by the fact that the Senate vote is the biggest to be turned out in the last three years. Every Senator either voted or was paired, except Senator Chavez, Dem., of New Mexico, who was detained at home defending a score of friends and relatives against Federal indictments charging misuse of WPA funds.
The Hon. Mr. Chavez put himself on record, however, as favoring the House figure.
FEBRUARY
7. President Roosevelt signs the $725,000,000 deficiency appropriation bill. He asks Congress to appropriate $150,000,000 more at once, as “a state of emergency” exists. He states, without bothering to mention it was his administrator who did it, that WPA rolls have been reduced by 360,000 since last October by not filling vacancies, and that by now there is a big waiting list of certified relief cases desperately in need of WPA jobs. But now it will be necessary to cut 1,000,000 off WPA on April I. The President announces that from now on, he himself will personally lead the fight for $150,000,000 more.
15. Representative White, of Ohio, says that Congress made the WPA cut as “an experiment”.
MARCH
6. Headline: ROOSEVELT FOR RESTORATION OF $150,000,000 RELIEF FUND BUT AGAIN ASSURES BUSINESS. PROMISES NO NEW TAXES.
9. Colonel Harrington states that even if the President’s $l50,000,000 is voted by April 1, it will still be necessary to drop 150,000 more WPA workers.
“This reduction, Colonel Harrington said, had been contemplated all along by the President and was intended by him when he originally asked Congress for $875,000,000.”
14. More than a month after he personally assumed leadership of the great battle for $150,000,000 more funds, President Roosevelt gets around to writing a formal letter to Congress about it. It is significant that neither now nor at any time in the last few years of such fake struggles with Congress over WPA appropriations has the President carried the fight to the people. Relief is too explosive an issue to be handled over the radio. The President prefers to rely on parliamentary maneuvers. Thus at this juncture, he “persuades” the mild New Dealer, Chairman Taylor of the House appropriations committee, to supersede the anti-New Deal Woodrum as head of the subcommittee on WPA The persuasive instrument is a promise of a million dollar irrigation project for Taylor’s home county. This Metternichean maneuver bears no visible fruit whatever, so far as the WPA fund is concerned.
It is revealed that, pursuant to the first WPA deficiency bill, 30,000 aliens have been dropped from WPA. In signing the bill, President Roosevelt made no objection to this provision.
David Lasser threatens that if the pink slips go out next week, “we will print 3,000,000 ballots for distribution among WPA workers to determine whether they want to stage a protest march on Washington”. (N.B. The ballots were printed, the vote was, according to the Workers Alliance’s own figures, about 20 to 1 in favor of a march, but no march took place. Once more, parade called off on account of rain – or something.)
20. The Workers Alliance brings one hundred hand-picked delegates from the South to plead, in the Congressional corridors, with the Southern Democrats for more relief funds. Net result: a Workers Alliance lobbyist gets his face slapped by Congressman Cox of Georgia when he makes the social error of presenting to the Congressman a Negro constituent. (The more respectable the left becomes in matters like this, the more unrestrained is the violence of the right.)
27. Congressman Cox gets the House to approve, 362 to 27, his proposal for an investigation of the WPA.
30. “We have never sought by the Federal program to provide for all who are eligible for WPA. If the full amount of $150,000,000 were appropriated there would still be approximately a million certified as eligible for WPA who would have to rely upn their own resources or upon the care of the states and localities.” This is an argument advanced against the $150,000,000 figure, by Representative Woodrum of Virginia, veteran leader of the anti-relief forces in the House.
31. The House votes $100,000,000 for relief, almost unanimously. This is the outcome of an extraordinary situation. The New Deal leaders in the House became convinced they could not carry the $150,000,000 figure. Woodrum offers to “compromise” on $100,000,000. The New Dealers agree and withdraw from the fight, leaving the fight against those who would cut relief below even this figure in the hands of Woodrum. Thus, for one day at least, Franklin D. Roosevelt yields his sword and buckler as the peerless champion of the unemployed to the gentleman from Virginia.
APRIL
11. The Senate considers the President’s request for $150,000,000 WPA funds. Senator Barkley, majority leader, makes a remarkable speech refusing to fight for the White House figure, on the grounds that $100,000,000 is all that can be gotten. “I am not going to kid the Senate, or kid the people of the United States by holding out the hope that they can get something they cannot get,” declares this great liberal statesman.
“So far as this amendment is concerned, I have not tried to exercize control over the vote of any Senator. I thought it unwise to precipitate this fight. ... I have not hawked myself around and electioneered in the cloakrooms.”
Such a display of high-mindedness in a party floor leader, approaching the scrupulous detachment of a Gallup Poll investigator, is a worthy companion-piece to the behavior of the New Deal leadership in the House on this same matter. The Senate votes for Mr. Woodrum’s $100,000,000, just as Senator Barkley predicted would happen.
14. Colonel B.B. Somervell, WPA administrator for New York City, proposes to his charges that they all work doubly hard, so as to complete all possible projects before the lay-offs begin. To stimulate their enthusiasm, he announces that the WPA group which has done most work by the end of the month will receive – “special mention.”
27. President Roosevelt sends to Congress his annual WPA message. For the fiscal year beginning July 1, he suggests an appropriation of $1,477,000,000, which will mean dropping 1,000,000 off the rolls. “The sum asked produced little unfavorable reaction in Congress.”
MAY
14. John L. Lewis, fearless leader of labor and militant champion of the masses, speaks out boldly, mincing no words, against the proposal to cut 1,000,000 off WPA, demands emphatically that at least 3,000,000 WPA jobs be provided next year. For a man in high public position, however, Mr. Lewis seems strangely ill-informed. He apparently is unaware that the 1,000,000 cut was proposed by the President, since in his eloquent letter there is not a single reference either to the New Deal or Roosevelt. Furthermore, through some clerical error, the letter is addressed not to “Franklin D. Roosevelt, the White House”, but to “Edward T. Taylor, chairman, House Appropriations Committee”.
23. Colonel Harrington, WPA chief, tells the Woodrum Committee that the Administration expects to be able to reduce WPA rolls to 1,500,000 by July 1, 1941 – a cut of just half.
JUNE
12. The Woodrum Committee ponders next year’s WPA appropriation. “Even the more conservative members,” reports the NY Times, “were said to regard Mr. Roosevelt’s request for $1,470,000,000 as ‘most reasonable’.”
17. The House passes its WPA bill for 1939–1940, an extremely reactionary measure, following almost completely the suggestions of the Woodrum Committee. The seriousness of the New Deal objections to this bill may be seen in the final vote on the measure: 373 to 21.
“Confusion marked the later hours of debate ... Hoots, catcalls, and boos greeted speakers ... The session was held before packed galleries, enjoying the ‘show’ ... As the hour grew late, the members shouted down the reading clerk as he attempted to read amendments. And without hearing them – it was impossible in the press gallery directly above the reading clerk to distinguish the words – the House voted them down.”
23. The Civil Service Standard, official organ of District I of State, County, and Municipal Workers of America (CIO), runs an editorial on the WPA situation: “The new Public Enemies can be routed! The civil service will rise to a man behind Roosevelt, LaGuardia, Lewis, Harrington, Somervell, and Hodson!” There is talk of the Standard being tinged with Stalinism.
29. The committees of the House and of the Senate wind up their long discussions of the WPA bill, which must be passed by both houses before midnight, June 30, the end of the fiscal year. Throughout these discussions, it has been clear that the House is more reactionary than the Senate as to the new bill. The liberals and organized labor pin their hopes to the Senate – but they forget that the House is also much more determined. The final joint bill reported out by the committee is, in all important respects, the House’s bill, that is to say, Representative Woodrum’s bill.
30. On the last day of the fiscal year, the 1940 relief bill, which goes into effect tomorrow, passes both houses of Congress. In the House, Representative Woodrum has a field day. “Congress for the first time has vigorously moved into this picture and asserted its prerogatives,” he quite correctly declares, and promises more such “assertions” in the future. The New Deal “opposition”, halfhearted at best, by now is completely helpless and demoralized. After taking up almost all the debating time, Woodrum “yielded to several New Dealers, who were forced to be content with whatever words they could sandwich in between derisive shouts from the other members, who showed an unwillingness for any delay and for any defense of WPA or its projects”. The final vote is carried by “a shouting, cheering majority of 321 to 23”. The minority was unable to force a roll-call. In the Senate, the bill was passed not only without a roll call but without even a record vote.
 
The Roosevelt-Woodrum Act
Thus was passed by the representatives of the people – who took care not to put their votes on record – the act which laid the legal basis for Federal relief in the present fiscal year (July 1, 1939 to June 30, 1940). It is by far the most reactionary relief measure to be passed since the beginning of the New Deal. It makes basic changes in the whole WPA set-up. The liberals, the Stalinists, and the CIO leadership unanimously blame its drastic provisions on the Congressional Tories. Just what does the act provide? What is the effect of each provision? And who is responsible? Let us see.
 
1. Provision: This fiscal year’s WPA appropriation set at $1,477,000,000. This sum, furthermore, is to be spent in twelve equal monthly instalments. (Hitherto, WPA funds have been spent when and as determined by the administrator.)
Effect: WPA rolls must average 2,000,000 this year, down 1,000,000 from last year. The equal-monthly-instalments provision is designed to make it harder to put through deficiency appropriations. In the past (see Chart II) the initial appropriation has usually been completely spent before the end of the fiscal year, and Congress has then had no choice but to vote more funds.
Responsibility: Credit for the equal-instalments provision goes to the Congressional “Republicrats”. Credit for the cut in total funds belongs to President Roosevelt, who wrote in his relief message to Congress on April 27:
“For the fiscal year 1940, I recommend, therefore, that the specific sum of $1,477,000,000 be provided for the Works Progress Administration ... This represents a reduction of one-third below the amount provided in the current fiscal year and will permit the employment of slightly more than 2,000,000 persons during the twelve months beginning July 1, 1939.”
 
2. Provision: All employees to work 130 hours a month, at no increase in wages.
Effect: Hitherto, WPA workers have been paid a monthly “security wage” – which is not affected by this provision – and the hours of work required of them per month have been adjusted so as to make their rate of pay that prevailing in private employment. The new arrangement means that union wages are no longer paid on WPA, and is therefore a serious blow at the national wage structure, especially in the building trades.
Responsibility: Rests entirely with the White House. Roosevelt’s WPA administrator, Colonel Harrington, first advanced this suggestion in his testimony last spring before the Woodrum Committee. After a long description of the technical difficulties of administering WPA with work-months of varying lengths and of the “inequities” the system inflicted on the unskilled workers – a smoke screen for the real object of the White House: to break the unions’ power on WPA – Colonel Harrington concluded:
“It is my recommendation that persons employed on projects of WPA be required to work 130 hours per month and that the earnings of such persons be on a monthly basis ... and that substantially the present national labor costs be maintained.” [38]
In signing the final bill, President Roosevelt made no objection to this provision – although the Democratic platform in 1936, on which he was reflected, included a specific prevailing wage pledge. We have already seen how the White House tried to abolish prevailing wages on WPA in 1935. And the current investigation by the Department of Justice into building-trade wages fits into the same general pattern. As the Washington columnists, Alsop and Kintner, recently put it:
“The President was not sorry to see the prevailing wage struck out of the last bill ... He is well known to regard the unions as primary obstacles to recovery.” [39]
 
3. Provision: All persons who have been on WPA for more than 18 months must be cut off the rolls by September 1. After thirty days, they can get back on again if

they are re-certified as completely destitute by the local relief authorities,
there is room on the WPA rolls, and
the local WPA head wants to take them back on.

Effect: This will cause much suffering to hundreds of thousands of WPA “veterans”, who will be forced onto relief at half or less their WPA earnings. It will also make it much more difficult to hold together WPA unions, since the organized workers will be largely replaced by new people from the rolls.
Responsibility: Rests primarily with the Republicrats. But it a worth noting that this ingenious union-busting device was first publicly proposed by Colonel Brehon Somervell, who has been in charge of WPA in New York City since 1936. The press in June 1937 was full of discussion of “The Somervell Plan” – identical with the present one – for getting rid of what the Colonel called “WPA career men”. [40] It is also worth noting that Colonel Somervell was not rebuked publicity by his superiors, nor did the President object to this provision in signing the bill.
 
4. Provision: Wage differentials between various parts of the country to be abolished, except insofar as they reflect differences in living costs.
Effect: Hitherto, wages have varied widely in different regions. Unskilled workers in the South, for instance, have been getting $26 a month, in the big cities of the North, $56. There is nothing like this much difference between Northern and Southern living costs. (A recent Bureau of Labor Statistics study put it at less than 3%.) There is, however, a great difference in living standards. The new provision aims to eliminate this difference. This is being done chiefly by raising WPA wages in the South. In New York City, for example, unskilled WPA workers have had their monthly pay cut $8 (from $60.50 to $52). In Southern cities WPA unskilled rates have gone up about $15 a month. [41]
Responsibility: The Southern Democrats put this one across. Their aim was partly to force a further series of wage cuts, but chiefly to get more WPA money for the South, whose share has always been low. (According to figures presented by Senator Byrnes of North Carolina: in 1936–1938, the thirteen Southern states, with a total population of 33,800,000, got only $609,400,000 WPA funds between them; while New York State alone (Pop.: 12,600,000) got $737,200,000, or about three times as much per capita.) But there is likely to be one unexpected kick-back to this provision: even a small rise in WPA wages in the South will bring them above the coolie level of private-employment wages down there, and thus tend to force up the whole Southern wage level. This is, of course, the last thing the Southern Democrats would want to happen.
 
5. Provision: Administrative costs may not exceed 4% of total expenditures.
Effect: Ostensibly a way of insuring that the maximum of funds spent go for relief, this provision is actually a cunning way of wrecking the whole program. It will reduce administrative outlays below the level of efficiency, will make it impossible to plan out projects with enough care, and so will lower the quality of work done. Thus public opinion will be prepared to favor complete liquidation of WPA.
Responsibility: Rests entirely with Congress.
 
6. Finally, there are a number of less important provisions, originated by Congress but not opposed very strongly by the Administration. All aliens are to be dropped from the rolls. At least twice a year, the financial status of every WPA worker must be investigated – at a cost of between $5 and $10 a head! In future; no project is to cost over $52,000 for materials – a limitation designed to restrict WPA to the kind of “boondoggling” projects most vulnerable to political attack. The Federal Theatre Project is abolished outright, and the art, music, writers, and research projects have been greatly restricted. The Administration put up a comparatively strong fight against this last change.
 
7. One minor provision deserves a paragraph to itself. One, at least, of the WPA millions got a raise in pay, namely, Colonel Harrington, whose salary was raised from $7,200 to $10,000. It seems the Colonel completely charmed the Woodrum Committee, and its chairman in particular. When the House discussed a proposal to replace the Colonel with a bi-partisan board –
“Colonel Harrington’s chief supporter turned out to be Mr. Woodrum himself, who in appreciation of Colonel Harrington’s precise and dignified testimony, publicly urged that he be made one of the proposed three-man WPA administrative board”. [42]
When it came to signing the bill, the President showed that he agreed with Mr. Woodrum that the Colonel should have his pay raised, just as Mr. Woodrum agreed with him that the other WPA-ers should have their pay cut.
 



It took almost three years for the United States to get into the last war. It seems safe to predict, that, if the present war lasts that long, we will be in it before it celebrates its first anniversary. Already the stage is set, and the Administration is waiting impatiently in the wings for its entrance cue. Social Security cards have been turned over to the War Department, to be used when the appointed time comes as a handy index of the nation’s man-power, complete with names and addresses. The Treasury Department, according to the N.Y. Herald-Tribune for August 31, has made all arrangements to print a new issue of Liberty Bonds. The Department of Justice has already begun an anti-espionage campaign. “There will be no repetition of the situation in 1917, when a democracy was unprepared to meet the espionage problem,” says Attorney-General Murphy. The War Resources Board, headed by Chairman Stettinius of U.S. Steel, has been set up to rule American economic life with dictatorial powers the day war is declared. The Administration is already working on plans to curb war profiteering and to lay in stocks of necessary war materials not produced in this country, such as tin, manganese, and rubber.
A paragraph buried deep in the N.Y. Times of September 2 reveals what is behind all this activity:
“President Roosevelt has been telling friends recently that the United States must be far better prepared for an emergency, if one comes, than it was in 1917, and the feverish activity among departments concerned with military, naval and industrial preparedness continued today. On several occasions lately, the President has pointed out the lapse of time between this country’s declaration of war in 1917 and the departure of the first troop ships for Europe.”
The actual outbreak of war has enormously speeded up the process of transforming the New Deal into the War Deal. By now, the vital departments in Washington are dominated by the trusted agents of the big bourgeoisie. These men are mostly assistant secretaries of this or that, members of the “Little Cabinet”. There is Louis Johnson in the War Department, creator of the War Industries Board, hard-boiled reactionary Legionnaire and friend of big business. There is Sum-ner Welles in the State Department, wealthy and aristocratic career diplomat, who has more or less openly shoved aside his chief, the mild, idealistic Cordell Hull. There is John W. Hanes in the Treasury Department, who made a fortune in Wall Street bfore he came to the Treasury last year, and who was in complete charge of the department until Secretary Morgenthau got back from his vacation a few days ago.
Messrs. Hull and Morgenthau are generally considered the extreme right wing of the Cabinet, but they are real liberals compared to Messrs. Johnson, Hanes and Welles. Not that it would make much difference since, in time of war, all secondary distinctions of “conservative” and “liberal” drop away and only the primary label, “bourgeois”, remains.
 
“Dollar-a-Year” Men Again
Morgenthau’s first act on getting back from abroad, for example, was to appoint three special assistants. They are: W.R. Burgess, vice-chairman of the great National City Bank of New York; Tom K. Smith, a St. Louis banker; and Earle Baillie, partner in the powerful private banking firm of J.&W. Seligman. Baillie was a Treasury official for a few weeks several years ago, until he resigned because of the New Deal’s “radicalism”. Now he gladly returns “to serve his country” at $1 a year.
Like their predecessors in the last war, these dollar-a-year men – and the imminence of our entry into the war is marked by their reappearance – are willing to give up high-salaried posts in order to protect their general class interests. In war, the supreme crisis of capitalism, the government becomes openly and without any fooling around what Marx called it: “the executive committee of the bourgeoisie”. And just as Earl Baillie would expect no pay for serving on the board of U.S. Steel, Inc., so he expects no pay for his services on the board of U.S.A., Inc.
A glimpse of what is happening in the upper reaches of the War Deal was provided in a recent column by Arthur Krock, chief political writer for the N.Y. Times. Mr. Krock, whose son Tommy lately returned from fighting for Franco in Spain, is a bitter reactionary. As the New Deal has been transformed into the War Deal, his attitude has changed accordingly, from hostility to suspicion to cautious approbation and now to something very close to enthusiasm.
“Lately,” he writes, “the President has been receiving, more and more, counselors of whom E.R. Stettinius Jr., U.S. Steel head, is a type. They have been calling at his request to discuss problems concerned with national security and defense. In any scheme of national unity such men must have that continuous access to Mr. Roosevelt which for some time has been confined to members of the one New Deal group which is always urging him to ‘fight’ one economic, social or political class on behalf of another.
“Ever since the threat of European war became acute, some observers profess to have noted a growing coolness at the White House toward this type of Presidential adviser, beginning with a rebuff of their protest against the Stettinius board. These observers say that consultants on the President’s radio speech last night did not include those makers of acid phrases, those buglers of class battle, whose contributions have often been found in White House oratory, but were headed by Secretary of State Hull and Under-Secretary Welles, very differently disposed counsellors indeed.”
Even before America’s entry into war, then, Wall Street has quite openly taken charge of the government. From that fact alone, even if we did not know the contents of the dictatorial Industrial Mobilization Plan, we know what “democracy” we are going to” get in the “war for democracy.”

A Short History of Liberalism, Vol. II.
The Liberals Dismount
I must admit I was a bit surprised at the abruptness with which the liberal weeklies hopped off the Stalinist band wagon after the horrible news about the Soviet-Nazi pact was out. I had expected a decent interval of squirming, rationalizations, and covering-up. Instead, in the very first issues published after the news broke, both the Nation and the New Republic began to swing their editorial axes in no uncertain fashion at the foundations of the impressive ideological structure they themselves for years now have been building up. The demolition job was done so fast, indeed, as to suggest the use not of axes but of straight dynamite. Thus ends a long and beautiful friendship.
There is a lesson here, it seems to me. We have tended to over-rate the fidelity to Stalinism of the vast army of liberal-bourgeois fellow-travellers of the American C.P. So long as the Stalin regime seemed useable as a catspaw for America’s war aims, so long did the liberals remain among the faithful. But once this role of Stalinism was cast in doubt – to say the least – the liberals dropped the C.P. like a hot potato. The question of who was using whom has been resolved most dramatically: it is now crystal-clear that the liberals were using the Stalinists, and not vice versa. Thus the pact has acted as one of those major, cataclysmic political shocks, which as Trotsky once put it, suddenly and unmistakeably lay bare the real, underlying class relationships of the intelligentsia. It takes such cataclysms to expose their roots, since in this sphere such connections are normally vague, hidden, and complicated.
 

The Ghost Goes West
The most pathetic casualty of the crisis was the newborn Committee of 400 which the Stalinists recently concocted to counter the damaging effects of the Committee for Cultural Freedom and the League for Cultural Freedom & Socialism. Such creations are shadowy, spectral affairs at best, but this particular ghost went west in record time. It burst into the press on August 14 with a stirring appeal to all men of good will to forget their petty sectarian quarrels and unite behind the Kremlin in the good fight against fascism. ‘’The Fascists and their allies are well aware that democracy will win if its supporters are united. Accordingly, they are intent on destroying such unity at all costs ... They have tried to prevent a united anti-aggression front by sowing suspicion between the Soviet Union and other nations interested in maintaining peace.” Just one week to the day after this noble, moving appeal, the pact was announced. What this news has done to the psyches of Dr. Max Lamer, Prof. Robert Morss Lovett, Corliss Lamont, Vincent Sheean, Dashiell Hammett, Donald Ogden Stewart, and their 394 comrades in arms – this is matter for Freudian speculation.
 

Johnson vs. Johnson
A central pillar of the War Deal is Louis Johnson, Assistant Secretary of War and the real power in the War Department. Johnson is a tough Legionnaire-politico, so tough, in fact, as to appall even General Hugh Johnson (no relation). The newly created War Resources Board, chairmanned by Stettinius of U.S. Steel and manned by DuPont-Morgan executives, was Louis Johnson’s brain-child. In one of his recent Scripps-Howard columns, General Johnson makes some sharp criticism of this board.
Old Iron Pants isn’t shocked by the idea in itself. Quite the contrary: “The need for such a board is absolute ... American industry in war must be under a one-man dictatorship as ruthless as Hitler’s.” It is the composition of the board that bothers the General. “To lead a country into war,” he writes with cynical frankness, “you have to do everything possible to carry full popular support ... Imagine the American enthusiasm for what would instantly be called ‘a Morgan-duPont war personally conducted by General Motors and the U.S. Steel Corp’.” The General goes on to accuse his namesake of a bit of Trotskyist sabotage: “Somebody in government was very dumb in ... inventing delay and discord as our first step in war preparation. Could it have been Assistant Secretary of War Johnson?” Comrade Vyshinsky, reach me that dossier marked “J”.
 

The Basutos Are Saved
Whether there is war or not, and whether the Axis or the Democracies are the victors, one thing can be predicted right now: no force except their own revolutionary action is going to strike off the shackles from the colonial peoples. The veneer of “democracy” is at its thinnest in the colonies. There the real nature of the struggle between the democratic and the totalitarian states appear nakedly, unmistakeably as a thieves’ quarrel over the privilege of picking the pockets of the masses.
Thus in a recent issue of the Pariser Tageszeitung, a German emigre daily of the Thomas Mann school of anti-fascism, there was an indignant news item headed: GOEBBELS ALSO KNOWS BASUTO, to the effect that Nazi propaganda, in the Basuto language, was being circulated in a newspaper among the Basuto tribes of the Transvaal. And how did the British meet this threat? The N.Y. Times report is specific: “The authorities of the Union of South Africa, realizing the danger of such propaganda among the easily influenced natives, especially when many of them are in economic difficulties, promptly confiscated the paper.” The Basutos are in “economic difficulties,” it seems. But they are not without powerful friends. Herr Hitler solves their troubles with propaganda. And Mr. Chamberlain solves them by “promptly” confiscating Herr Hitler’s propaganda. Which leaves the Basutos just where they were before.
 



Lost in the Dismal Swamp
AT FIRST GLANCE, Charles and Mary Beard’s America in Mid-Passage looks like the book bargain of the year: almost 1,000 pages – 977, to be exact – of history, forming the final volume (1925–1938) of the authors’ celebrated Rise of American Civilization. Trying to read this thick volume, however, is like being lost in the Dismal Swamp lands of Virginia. The style, none too firm and precise in the Beards’ best books, is by now definitely marshy. (The Beards begin their section on the CIO-AFL split with this lucid sentence: “Whether as a consequence of the new federal legislation or as another incident in a long stream of economic and intellectual tendencies, a terrific clash among labor leaders and within the ranks of industrial workers tore into the labor system and intensified the conflict of other interests in America.” I find it hard to visualize an incident in a stream, nor do I see how a clash can tear into a system. The scenery, furthermore, is extremely monotonous: the Beards evidently have a corps of none too imaginative research workers, who have piled up on the masters’ desks a huge heap of newspaper clippings, which are crammed into the book without very much predigestion.)
There is at once too much data in the book and not enough. There are too many longwinded quotations from public figures like Nicholas Murray Butler – the Beards, like most liberals, take all speeches, articles, and other verbal outpourings of public personages with the utmost seriousness – and too little solid statistical documentation. There is an interminable amount of vague speculation about the episodic shifts of the New Deal, and very little about unemployment, the labor movement, or left-wing groups. It is hardly believable, but the Beards on the one hand devote seven full pages to summarizing the plots of three obscure novels – Jack Conroy’s The Disinherited (two pages), Kay Boyle’s My Next Bride (three pages) and Hamilton Basso’s In Their Own Image (two pages), and on the other hand devote to the General Motors strike just one sentence (“In February, 1937, the Committee ‘breached the united front of the basic industries in winning a contract with the General Motors Corporation’, hitherto an adroit and indomitable foe.”). The entire CIO campaign in Big and Little Steel is disposed of in just one sentence:
“While the country was watching the outcome with anxiety, ‘Big Steel’ came to terms with industrial unionism in March 1937; but ‘Little Steel’, personified in its spokesman, Tom Girdler of the Republic Steel Company, refused to sign on the dotted line and presented a solid front of resistance.”
There is not a single word in all these thousand pages, so far as I have been able to find, about either the San Francisco maritime strike of 1934 or the Minneapolis truck drivers’ strikes.
Such disproportions are symptomatic of the terrible effects of the ever-sharpening crisis of American capitalism on the liberal consciousness. When a historian of the rank of Charles A. Beard shows such an obvious deterioration, it is small wonder that the liberal weeklies, edited by journalists of much lesser stature, have degenerated as they have done in the last two years.
But the passage which really makes one gasp at its ignorance, irresponsibility, and malice is the following description (p. 540) of the role of the “Trotskyites” – Beard apparently lumps all anti-CP tendencies on the left under this heading – in the CIO movement:
Despising the Stalinite wing of communism with the intensity of disillusionment following utter confidence in Utopia, Trotzkyites took delight in pointing out and exaggerating the communistic element in the industrial unions. A small fraction themselves, they would have wielded slight influence had it not been for the energy of the general opposition riding full tilt against the Committee. Riding with it, they obtained for their testimony and for their “revelations” a degree of publicity that could not have been won otherwise. In this state of affairs their writings and agitations gave the press an opportunity to whip up resentment against the only form of unionism that, in the nature of mass production, could offer any method of accomplishing the wholesale organization of labor in the United States.
When a reputable historian thus echoes the grossest and most easily refuted falsifications of the Stalinist press, one senses the advanced stage of decomposition reached by the bourgeois-liberal tradition in history-writing, as in history-making.
 
The Crisis in Education (Continued)
Month before last I devoted this department to a consideration of the crisis in popular education, as revealed in nation-wide slashing of school funds and worsening of educational standards. I think it worth devoting a little space now to the recent annual convention of the National Education Association. The seriousness of the current educational crisis manifested itself dramatically in the sessions, attended by no less than fifteen thousand teachers and educators from all over the country.
The National Education Association, which has 800,000 members, is a rather conservative and stuffy organization. Its past meetings have been staid, routine affairs. Not so the 1939 gathering. Speech after speech emphasized the terrible cuts that have already been made in school appropriations, and the even deeper cuts that will probably be made in the next few months. President Shaw gave the keynote speech, pointing out that 800,000 children between seven and thirteen did not go to school last year because there were no schools open for them to go to (he didn’t mention the much greater number who didn’t go to school because of insufficient food or clothing, or because their small earnings were needed at home), and that there were no high school facilities for 3,500,000 boys and girls of high school age. He spoke of the importance of education in preventing crime, in preserving democratic forms, etc. But when he came to suggest a Way Out, he could only say:
“The teaching profession must improve greatly its contact with the public to the end that those who produce funds for the support of the schools will have more clearly in mind the facts and their importance in connection with our particular form of government.”
In plain words: teachers must go out and sell the ruling class on the idea that cuts in school funds mean a weakening of “democracy”. Dr. Shaw suggested they start in working on Kiwanis, Rotary, and the American Legion. This would seem to be a rather tough selling assignment.
Hardly more hopeful as a solution was the “Trust in the New Deal” note struck by many other speakers. There is now before Congress, as it has been for many months, a bill to appropriate large sums of Federal money for the rescue of the beleaguered school system. The reporter for the NEA’s legislative commission, President Graham of the American Association for School Administration, spoke most hopefully of this.
It is my opinion [he said] that the opportunity for passing the Federal aid bill in 1940 is good. It can be passed in the Senate at the present time. A majority of the Senators are for it. If the Administration would give active support in the House, it could be passed for the House.
Last June in New York the President, in his speech to the NEA, showed that he believed in Federal aid. Therefore, it is my conclusion that the opportunity to pass the bill in 1940 is excellent.
The good doctor’s logic is impeccable, but his premises are shaky. The President has an excellent command of heart-warming language, but he is an impulsive sort of fellow who often lets his heart run away with his head. And his head these days is concerned with two subjects only: the coming crusade to make the world safe for democracy, and the 1940 elections. The difficulties of the school system will be solved by the New Deal only in so far as the solution fits into these dominant patterns.
Far from urging Congress to appropriate new millions for education, the President has taken the lead in cutting WPA. This produced an ironical situation at the NEA convention, by the way. One of the speakers, L.R. Alderman, director of the educational division of the WPA, drew a gloomy picture of the nation’s educational progress:
“When we take a look at ourselves, we see that two-thirds of us adults have less than an elementary school education, that 85% of us have less than a secondary school education, and that there are twice as many of us who are illiterate as there are college graduates.”
One of the reasons for this deplorable state of affairs, he said, is the common belief that adults cannot be educated. Proudly he described the WPA program for adult education, which has reached through its classes no less than 7,000,000 men and women. But even as he was speaking, WPA officials in Washington were working on plans to liquidate this and similar programs, which had become impossible luxuries as a consequence of the drastic cut in WPA funds. And who first proposed this cut to Congress? Who but that same Franklin D. Roosevelt to whom the assembled teachers looked so hopefully for a solution of their fiscal difficulties!
 
Rappoportiana
From a recent issue of Les Hommes du Jour, a French periodical, I excerpt some rather amusing mots d’esprit by the well-known French left-wing politician, Charles Rappoport :
“Leon Blum is more successful in small things than in great. It’s not really his fault, but rather that of the times: you don’t replace window panes during an earthquake. And Blum is a glazier of the tottering capitalist regime.”
* * *
“Bolshevism is Blanquism, with Tartar sauce.”
* * *
“Stalin, instead of executing the constitution which promises every liberty, prefers to execute the revolutionists who inspired it.”
* * *
Some one once asked Rappoport why he detested the social democrats so much. “Because they have forced me to become a Bolshevik.”
During a tea-table discussion on Bolshevism, a countess once asked him: “Is it true that in Russia the commissars of the people have blanks with which they can requisition the pretty girls they pass in the street?” “Madame la Comtesse,” he answered, “you are getting your regimes mixed. Here, in the Champs Elysée, a hundred franc bill is a requisition order for most of the women, pretty and otherwise, one passes in the street.”
 
Civil War Among the Masses
When jobs are few, as they are today, the masses can react in one of two ways. They can fight against the ruling class which maintains the system that is starving them. Or they can fight a civil war among themselves for the scanty employment and governmental funds available. It is an ominous sign of the times that such internecine warfare between the various sections of the masses seems to have become more pronounced since the 1937 business decline.
Thus at the NEA convention described above, one of the main themes was the increasingly open conflict between the advocates of old age pensions and those who want to maintain educational appropriations.
“For the first time in the history of our civilization,” said President Frasier of Colorado State College of Education, “the oldsters are lining up against the youngsters.”
The group organized to discuss the crucial topic, Can America Afford to Educate Her Children? – it is significant that the theme was put in the form of a question – spent most of its time debating “whether states must choose between schools for the young and pensions for the aged”.
Octogenarians can vote, school children can’t. The political advantages, both short term and long term, would seem to lie with the old folks. Short-term: the weight of the Townsend and similar movements in last fall’s elections, and the fact that Congress has just liberalized old-age pension payments under the Social Security Act but shows no signs of acting on Federal aid for education. Long-term: the declining birth rate and increasing longevity of the average age of the American population: actuaries expect a steady rise in the average age of the population over the next few decades. Youth will have to fight, and fight hard, for every concession it gets in the future – under capitalism, at least.
Age-vs.-Youth is only one of many such struggles now breaking out in our dying economic system. A week after the NEA convention, the National Federation of Business and Professional Women’s Clubs met in Kansas City, and spent most of its time talking about “the most serious problem confronted in its twenty years of existence”. Recent Gallup polls have shown that 85% of those polled oppose married women holding jobs. In some twenty state legislatures bills have been introduced barring married women from state and city jobs and other forms of employment.
“We must remember,” warned one of the speakers at the convention, “that it was easier to get the vote than it may be to retain our jobs. This is possibly going to be a battle for livelihood, a kind of fight in which men are not apt to be gallant or even just. They give no quarter here.”
It is one of the paradoxes of capitalism that most people oppose jobs for married women on the grounds that they don’t “need” the money since they have a husband as breadwinner – whereas in actuality, as the 1937 Federal unemployment census showed, many if not most of the married women now working have been forced into employment because their husbands are jobless or on part-time wages too small to support their families. The number of women and children in jobs has been going up in late years, because only by selling the whole family labor power – remember Marx on capitalism as the guardian of the family hearth! – can many working-class families get along.
Youth against age! Married women against men! Thus are the masses atomizing themselves into warring groups waging merciless civil war upon one another. Many other similar antagonisms might be mentioned. The old Negro-vs.-white conflict has been sharpened by discrimination’s against the Negro in hard times – always “first to be fired, last to be hired”, as the relief records of any large city will show. There is also anti-Semitic feeling, another old and dangerous division which, according to many observers close to labor, has been spreading lately even in the ranks of the working class. Most fatal of all, there seems to be a growing antagonism between employed and unemployed workers, a split in the ranks of the proletariat which offers fine opportunities to fascist demagogues. Unless these internecine struggles are suspended in favor of a common struggle against the economic system which makes jobs scarce in the first place, it will be fascism and not socialism that puts an end to the present social chaos.
 




Gold Is Where You Find It
An average of fifty people write in every day of the year to the Department of the Interior asking about the chances for settling down in the Mantanuska colony in Alaska. A lot of people also write in asking where they can get a divining-rod to locate buried treasure. Both these requests are in the same class, as far as the Department of the Interior is concerned. It has to write back that divining-rods don’t work, and that the capitalist system doesn’t either – or, at least, that there aren’t any jobs in Alaska, or anywhere else.
 

Boss Bites Business Manager
In the July 5 issue of The Guild Reporter, mouthpiece of the American Newspaper Guild, there is a little tale of poetic justice that seems worth reprinting here:
DENVER – Retribution has caught up with C.A. Moore, business manager of the Denver Rocky Mountain News, and a Scripps-Howard executive for 19 years, who knows how to dish it out but can’t take it.
Some months ago, Moore, deep in the security of a well-paying job, forced a sub-standard bulletin board agreement upon the Denver Guild. The agreement, which was entirely unilateral, covered commercial department employees. He refused to even discuss a contract which the Guild sought as a supplement to an exciting editorial agreement. He challenged the Guild’s right to represent employees. “Loyalty” pledges, semi-secret and open anti-Guild propaganda appeared among employees. But an NLRB election gave the Guild an overwhelming majority, and bargaining started.
Moore stalled for months. Finally, under pressure, he posted the sub-standard agreement. It included a maximum of 10 weeks’ dismissal indemnity for 10 or more years’ of service.
Several weeks ago Moore was fired. The next day he came around and demanded dismissal indemnity. He was handed a check for 10 weeks’ pay.
“I’ve been with Scripps-Howard almost 20 years,” be protested. “I should get a half-year’s salary.”
“Nothing doing,” he was told. “The bulletin board agreement calls for 10 weeks’ pay as a maximum. The agreement was your baby.”
 

Judge Manton Again
In this column several months ago I pointed out one episode in the career of Justice-at-a-Price Martin Manton which seemed to have been overlooked by both Dewey and the press: the Judge’s last-minute interjection of himself into a case involving the Associated Gas & Electric Co. I now see by the papers that a $12,000 check made out by A.G.E. payable to Manton has turned up in the hearings on A.G.E. now taking place before the Securities & Exchange Commission.
 

The I.A.M.S.S.P.R.S.T.M.S.H.T.H.
“A quick check indicates that any man who belongs to the International Association of Marble Slate & Stone Polishers, Rubbers & Sawyers, Tile & Marble Setters Helpers & Terrazo Helpers can safely bet any other unionist that the IAMSSPRSTMSHTH has the longest name of any international union in America.” – The Industrial Worker, May 13, 1939.
 

The Cream of the Jest
The New Deal’s attack on the “economic royalists” – remember when F.D.R. used to talk in such terms? – has never been more than a bad joke. And the other day the royalists skimmed some very rich cream off this particular jest.
When it was discovered, in 1933, that J.P. Morgan and his partners had paid no income taxes in 1931 and 1932, the New Deal made the nation ring with demagogic outcries. With much pomp and circumstance, F.D.R. pushed through Congress a bill making it impossible to deduct capital losses in figuring income tax – the particular loophole Messers. Morgan & Co. had crawled through. With equally loud lamentations, Morgan & Co. paid up sums in back taxes.
They paid, but they also appealed. And a week or so ago, without any pomp and circumstance or public uproar whatsoever, buried deep in a routine press release from the Treasury Department, the following tax refunds for 1931 and 1932 were announced:



J.P. Morgan


 


$338,774.25




Thomas W. Lamont


  138,783.45




R. C. Leffingwell


    80,254.53




Junius S. Morgan


    45,231.73




George Whitney


    44,587.25



But the really rich cream of the jest – heavy, Grade A, 80 cents a quart – is that these gentlemen will get not only their money back but also interest on it at 6%, which is a lot more than they could have hoped for in any reasonably safe investment these days.
 




The Old Misleader
Some one remarked to me the other day that for a long time he had thought the tone which Bolshevist revolutionaries used towards the reformists was much too sharp and melodramatic. Recently, however, he has come to see that every epithet, every “hangman of the working class!”, every “lackey of capitalism!” was and is justified, that it would be almost impossible to paint in too black colors the treachery and cowardice of groups like the Social Democratic Federation. The closer American capitalism draws to its supreme crisis of war and fascism, the more implacably anti-revolutionary become the reformists. The working of this process can be seen easily if one has followed, as I have, the last year of the S.D.P. organ, The New Leader. As the war draws near, this journal has taken on an ever-increasing similarity to the jingoistic, chauvinist “socialist” sheets of the Europe of 1914. The one difference is all in their favor: they at least waited until the war had actually broken out before dropping the “socialist” mask and appearing frankly as recruiting agents for the bourgeois war machines.
But The Old Misleader isn’t waiting for M-Day to dish out what Engels was vulgar enough to call “the old crap.” Week after week, its front page is black with scare heads about the inroads that fascism is making in Peru and the heroic defense measures of brave little Poland, the current workers’ fatherland. This week’s glad tidings for the American working class is the front-page head: POLISH CAVALRY CAPABLE OF ROUTING MOTORIZED NAZIS.
 

F.D.R. Removes the Fig Leaf
When it comes to domestic news, The Old Misleader is, just now, in a really pathetic position, as are its comrades in arms, The Nation, The Daily Worker, and The CIO News. It is getting increasingly harder to kid the masses about their friend in the White House when he publicly congratulates Congress on removing the prevailing-wage provision from this year’s WPA act, when he denounces the WPA strikers and looses his G-men on them, and when he appoints to head the Social Security Board the quasi-fascist machine politician Paul McNutt.
And so a hasty glance at The Old Misleader fails to indicate there’s a WPA strike on at all. Its issue of July 15, at the height of the whole business, relegates the strike to less than a column on page two. (This story, incidentally, is a masterpiece of falsification. By carefully mixing up two entirely separate sections of the WPA bill – the one nullifying the prevailing wage clause, and the one forbidding regional differences in wage rates – the author is able to write: “Although the Administration opposed abolition of the differentials, the President has announced that his Administration will attempt to carry out the new provisions “of the law.” Actually, of course, the President favors the abolition of the first (or prevailing wage) “differential,” and is opposed only to the abolition of the regional wage differential.
The only other reference in the whole eight pages to the ticklish subject is a cut-and-dried little notice in a corner of page eight, headed in small type: “S.D.F. Scores WPA Cuts.”
The banner headline on page one is: ANTI-AXIS FORCES ANGERED BY U.S. ‘NEUTRALITY,’ with the subhead, amazing even in this cloud-cuckoo land: OLDER GERMANS, EMBITTERED BY CONGRESS ACTION, TURN TO HITLER. It seems that Jack Sandford, the Misleader’s enterprising correspondent in France, performed a remarkable journalistic feat. As soon as he received the news that Congress had refused to revise the Neutrality Act, he at once took a Gallup Poll of the eighty million citizens of Germany to see how they felt about it. He is, naturally, somewhat excited about his findings, as, evidently, were the editors. “The psychological effects,” he hints darkly, “may be incalculable.” And then for the real news scoop: “I learn already that it has thrown masses of the elder generation of neutral Germans into the Nazi camp.” That hitherto unchallenged mass psychoanalyst, Walter Duranty, had better look to his laurels!
 

Those Terrible Trotskyites!
On this same front page there is another story which deserves a few words: TROTSKYITE ‘GUARDS’ DRIVE AIDS COUGHLIN. This is a very snooty little piece, very superior indeed – “the tiny Socialist Workers Party,” “the obscure Trotskyite newspaper, The Socialist Appeal,” etc. Specifically, the Misleader is sore because Comrade Milton’s proposal that his local of the ILGWU form a Workers Anti-Fascist Defense Guard gave Father Coughlin a chance to attack the ILGWU and to wound the tender sensibilities of that shrinking violet, David Dubinsky.
When it comes to more general criticism, the usual Stalinist objections are raised. (It is interesting how indistinguishable on all major matters are the lines of the S.D.F. and the C.P.) Such guards “provoke violence.” They are “illegal.” There is “strong public opinion against private armies.” And, above all, what’s wrong with the police as protection for workers’ meetings against the Coughlinites?
All of these arguments, except the one about illegality (which is news to me), would apply to any strike. But the workers would be foolish to listen to any such line. Despite the danger of provoking violence, despite the undoubtedly strong public opinion against the use of force by pickets, and despite the splendid protection offered by the forces of law and order, the strikers must nevertheless, however reluctantly and with however heavy hearts, wreak violence on the persons of any scabs in the neighborhood. Any one who has been on a picket line knows this, and any one who has seen LaGuardia’s cops “protecting” anti-fascist meetings or has had a glimpse of the Social Justice goon squad in action knows why Workers Guards are necessary.
 




“Business Is Business”
The great nations are today helping one another to be ready to fight, quite possibly with each other, as never before. From their principal ports hundreds of ships are streaming over the seas with the finished products and the materials which war must have. “Business is business,” and in no business today is there more intense competition than there is in this great business. All perfectly legal, of course; yet, for example, it cannot be exactly pleasant, just now, for an Englishman to learn that Britain is sending 300,000 tons of coal to Germany every month; that Italy has just arranged for 1,000,000 tons of that necessity, from British mines; that during 1938 Germany received from Britain, France and Belgium ten million metric tons of imports largely of a character of potential assistance to her in preparation for war; that during 1938 Germany’s imports of pig iron and scrap were nearly five times greater than they were two years before; that Britain, France and Belgium sent to Germany 45 per cent of that nation’s recently imported supplies of iron ore and ore containing manganese. And the great supplies of oil that Britain has sent to Germany are, of course, a matter of common knowledge.
Britain’s aircraft factories are producing large quantities of planes for export as well as those for her own defense. The United States’ exports to Japan have been, and are being, of enormous assistance to that country. The Netherlands East Indies are practically defenseless, and the jittery mood of those important islands is evidenced by the wiring of oil wells for destruction. Yet the Netherlands were one of the three countries which supplied Japan with 75 per cent of her war necessities last year. Russia, of course, has sent vast supplies to China, but Germany’s deep affection for Japan has not interfered with her also entering the rich Chinese market. Indeed, Tokyo believes that Germany has aided China in this respect more than has any other nation. In the World War thousands of German soldiers perished before Verdun on barbed wire “made in Germany” which France received, through Switzerland, shortly before the war began, and many a British soldier met his death through an agency that was the product of his homeland. So it would be again.
Krupps still find business satisfaction in the fact that at Jutland both the British and German fleets carried their products. Before Hitler, Krupps employed 46,000; today, 105,000. Business is excellent. A recent annual report of Krupps ended thus:
In conclusion, the committee desires to report that it has taken full cognizance of reports that a conference designed to bring to pass a reduction of armaments is to be held, and that it has definitely established that these reports are baseless. The industry may, therefore, be assured that the coming year will be a period of undisturbed activity and steadily increasing prosperity. Makers of armaments in other lands also see few evidences of any depression.

NOTE: What you have just read is the full text, reprinted without addition or alteration, of an editorial which appeared in the N.Y. Times for August 21, 1939. Just what was in back of the mind of the editors of the Times in printing such an editorial, I don’t know. But anyway, they have my thanks for doing a job I couldn’t have done (much) better myself. – D.M.
 




Automotive Progress – in Reverse
The twenty-first edition of Automobile Facts and Figures was recently issued by the Automobile Manufacturers Association. It is an enthusiastic volume, full of big figures: last year motorists paid one out of every eight tax dollars, their total tax bill coming to $1,529,312,125 ... total cars registered were 27,628,879 ... the industry was the nation’s No. 1 consumer of steel, rubber, plate glass, nickel, lead and mohair ... it accounted for the direct and indirect employment of 6,380,000 workers, or one-seventh of all persons gainfully employed last year ... and so on ... and so on.
There was one rather interesting fact about this “surging giant of production”, as the N.Y. Times called it editorially, which somehow didn’t get into the book. It may be found in a recent report of the National Association of Sales Finance Companies, and it is that last year more automobiles, both new and used, were repossessed because of failure to keep up payments than in any year in the history of the industry. Almost 20% of all used cars sold were repossessed (next highest peak was 13% in 1932) and almost 7% of all new cars (the 1932 peak being slightly less than 6%).
“It is somewhat astonishing,” comments the Cleveland Trust Company’s Bulletin, “to find that the increase in repossessions resulting from the sudden business relapse which began late in 1937 was considerably more serious than that at the bottom of the great depression in 1932.”
A serious crack seems to be developing in the imposing facade of the automobile industry – one of many such cracks which have become increasingly evident in the structure of American capitalism since the 1937 collapse.
 

Weather Report
Those who follow the whimsically humorous weather reports which are printed on the first page of the N.Y. World-Telegram every evening must have been startled to read the report for July 29 last:
“The winds today are taking a middle of the road position. They are moderate and southerly. The temperature is far from subversive – a good substantial, sound money, 85 degrees at most. But the humidity is sheer Trotskyism – insidious, crafty, boring from within and without.”
The friend who called this to my attention adds that the report appeared this way in the home edition, but that in later editions the reference to Trotskyism was deleted. He suggests that the term is coming to have the same significance for the bourgeoisie that “Communism” had before the C.P. went respectable. I hope he’s right.
 

Spain: Work in Progress
As might have been expected, the victory of Franco is bringing into being a Fascist regime of so extreme a type as to be almost a burlesque on even Italy and Germany. The complete crushing in the Civil War of all resistance from the masses and the backward nature of the Spanish economy and ruling class made this result easily predictable. But the lengths to which things have gone is still a little surprising. From the press I glean a few of the more startling recent disclosures:

Item: Every family must get an official budget book and must record thereto “with the greatest honesty and scrupulousness” all receipts and expenditures. These books will be periodically inspected by the Ministry of Labor “to determine the actual necessities of the home,” that is, to see how low the wage scale may be safely fixed.
 
Item: At San Sebastian, swank bathing place, women’s bathing suits must carry knee-length skirts and have tops that reach the neck and men bathers must wear tops. Fine for violations: $18.
 
Item: Maids in the houses of Madrid noblemen now get $4.50 a month. This correspondent adds: “You can tell the maids from the aristocrats on the streets because the maids are not allowed to wear hats.”
 
Item: The Ministry of the Interior has organized a large crop of censors to survey all past productions of Spanish art, literature and music and to “eliminate” any works they consider “inimical to the interests of Spain.” A staff of “several thousand” functionaries censor every letter sent or received and all phone calls. All Spaniards must report to the Ministry the presence in homes or shops of any books of “unfriendly character.”
 
Item: Women are strictly forbidden to lie down on Spanish beaches.
 
Item: On July 30, General Franco decreed that all Spanish men between the ages of 18 and 50 must work fifteen days each year for the State without pay. This return to the medieval corvée has been ventured in no other Fascist nation so far; even Hitler pays the unemployed youth who work on the farms something, and they get their board and keep besides. But, as Franco eloquently put it in a recent speech: “Work, being a social duty, will be universally demanded in some form or other of all Spaniards who are not crippled, as it must be deemed a tribute that all must pay to the wealth of the country.”

The most interesting item of all, however, is that on August 7 the New Deal administration, which so shocked and pained its admirers by its prompt diplomatic recognition of the Franco regime, took steps to show its friendliness for its sister democracy in more substantial form. The Export-Import Bank, chief organ of the Administration’s dollar diplomacy, announced it was extending $13,750,000 in credits to Nationalist Spain to make it possible for it to buy American cotton. The editorial moaning and wailing of the Nation and the New Republic can be imagined!
 




A Short History of American Liberalism
“Mr. Walter Lippmann has temporarily severed his connection with the editorial board of the New Republic to enter the service of the War Department.” – Editorial announcement in the New Republic for June 9, 1917.
 

“Unpardonable! ... Amazing!”
I doa’t want to waste much more space on The New Leader, but I had no room last week to make one interesting point, namely, that journal’s current success in getting unattached leftist writers to adorn its pages. Its list of contributors sounds like a roll-call of the Trotsky Defense Committee: Sidney Hook, James Rorty, Suzanne LaFollette, Benjamin Stolberg, Charles Yale Harrison, Max Nomad, Ferdinand Lundberg. The odd thing is that, from what I can gather, most of these writers object, with varying degrees of violence, to the Leader’s basic editorial program: its support of the war drive, and its shameless prostration before the New Deal. (A classic in its way was the headline on a recent memorial tribute to Morris Hillquit: “HILLQUIT’S LIFELONG STRUGGLE BEARS FRUIT IN NEW DEAL LAWS”. But I still prefer Trotsky’s characterization of Hillquit as “a socialist leader for dentists”.)
There are many and complex reasons for this curious state of affairs, but right now I want to do no more than remark on two fresh and peculiarly dramatic examples.
In the July 29 issue, Charles Yale Harrison devoted his regular department, which is the main feature of the editorial page, to a denunciation of the President for his recent WPA actions. Of the Woodrum relief bill he writes: “To place the blame for this iniquitous act solely upon the shoulders of the Tories is sheer intellectual dishonesty. Mr. Roosevelt, as any Washington correspondent will tell you, never lifted a finger to halt its passage.” After some fine sneering at the miserable squirmings of the liberal and Stalinist journals, Mr. Harrison has to add: “And even the publication which is graced by this column lapsed into an unpardonable editorial silence.” If the silence was unpardonable, then it would seem logical to expect Mr. Harrison not to pardon it. But it was hardly a surprise to find him, in the next issue, back at the same old stand.
In the August 5 issue, James Rorty writes a letter beginning: “In your July 8 issue I read with amazement the resolution on peace, war and fascism adopted at the annual convention of the Social Democratic Federation of New York City.” (The Leader’s contributors seem to live in a state of perpetual surprise that Social Democrats behave like – Social Democrats.) Mr. Rorty’s letter is answered by Algernon Lee with a blast headed, “SOCIALIST MOVEMENT NEVER PACIFIST; FREEDOM WORTH FIGHTING FOR”. Lee doesn’t yield an inch, of course: the editors know quite clearly just what they want and where they are going, even if their contributors don’t.
The Leader’s contributors view its scandalous editorial policy from a height of magnificent personal aloofness. They do their stuff in one column, while the editors go to town across the page. It’s like a very pure and high-minded young man who, with the utmost detachment from all that goes on about him, comes in every night to play the bawdy house piano for the customers.
 

How’s-That-Again Department
“Since the first of the year, the outlook for the New Deal has undergone a startling transformation ... Politically, what has happened to revive the New Deal fortunes is that the anti-New Deal Democrats have come to realize it would be suicide for them and their party to repudiate the New Deal ... The expected assault on the New Deal by an obviously conservative Congress did not materialize.” – from an article, The New Deal Has a Future by Alfred M. Bingham in the current issue of Common Sense. Mr. Bingham’s article bears the sub-head: “An Editorial Observer Finds the Washington Atmosphere Tense with a New Confidence and Sense of Direction.”
 

Sweet-Land-of-Liberty Department
A friend sends in the following exhortation printed on the menu of a New York restaurant:
“Americans are bad people to cross when their simple pleasures are threatened. Think what happened over tea in 1776. [NOTE BY D.M. (just to show that Earl Browder isn’t the only one who knows about such matters): The Boston Tea Party took place December 18, 1773.] Or what might happen if ‘Pie à la Mode’ were denied us today.
“Think it over. Ice cream on pie stands for the American Way. A truly Yankee Doodle dish, Americans eat Pie à la Mode only for the fun of it. Not for duty. Not because they’re told they must.
“Ice cream on pie is an American heritage – a symbol of a free land, where one can say, do, and eat as he pleases. On our menu it appeals to the robust, free-thinking, free-eating, free-spending type of American who has built this great country of yours. Let him have it.”
The pie à la mode, my friend adds, was lousy.
 



To the Editors:
KRONSTADT is with us once more – this time as The Truth About Kronstadt, a mimeographed pamphlet written by John G. Wright and published by the National Educational Department of the SWP. I have no great wish to rehash the Kronstadt affair. It seems to me there are many more basic questions than Kronstadt involved in the problem of the degeneration of the Soviet state. Furthermore, at this time, the problems of the present are so pressing and threatening that one begrudges time and energy spent on even the most important historical questions. Let sleeping dogs lie, for the moment at least, I would say. But the very fact that Wright’s pamphlet has just been published seems to show that this dog – wretched cur! – is not sleeping.
I feel a special obligation not to pass Wright’s pamphlet by in silence because of the fact that my first appearance in the pages of The New International was as a critic of Trotsky’s article on Kronstadt. I was not convinced by that article, and I am not convinced by Wright’s pamphlet. Wright scores some sharp points, particularly as to the haste with which the insurgents precipitated the uprising, and the evidence that bourgeois counter-revolutionary forces abroad made use of the uprising for their own purposes. But he does not meet either of the two strongest charges levelled at the Bolsheviks in this affair – does not meet them, I suspect, because they cannot be met.
The first charge is that the uprising was primarily an explosion of mass discontent with the Bolshevik rule because

the masses were being starved by the oppressive regulations of “War Communism”, and
 
the Communist party, in gutting the Soviets of all political power and outlawing all other parties, whether working-class or not, had blocked all avenues through which the masses could express their opposition to this War Communism.

If I may be allowed the metaphor without being accused of perpetrating an amalgam, Wright presents the Kronstadt uprising in much the same terms as the American press usually presents a strike – as the work of a handful of “agitators”, in this case, bourgeois-Menshevik-White Guard agitators. But, as we know from strike experience, agitators can set masses in motion only when there is a basis for their agitation in widespread popular discontent. The fact that within a few weeks after Kronstadt, Lenin retreated from War Communism to the NEP – and, incidentally, later admitted it was a serious political error not to have done so earlier – and the fact that the published demands of the rebels were for free elections to the Soviets, a relaxation of the restriction on internal trade, etc. – all this seems to indicate that Kronstadt was primarily an expression of deepseated popular protest against the policies of the Communist party. Party, irrespective of what use party. (And it does not settle anything to talk about “the grey mass” or “petty-bourgeois elements”.)
Wright’s pamphlet, however, does not even mention the specific demands of the Kronstadters.
The other main charge is that the Bolsheviks suppressed the uprising with extreme brutality. Wright does take notice of this in a footnote, but only to distort it.
“A fortress had finally been taken by storm,” he writes, “after a resistance that was most stubborn and determined. Previous assaults had been repulsed with heavy losses, Now the fighting shifted to the streets, block to block, house to house. A hand-to-hand struggle ensued, the most savage form of modern warfare. ‘A massacre!’ wails Serge ...”
But Serge, as I recall it, makes no such infantile accusation as this. He charges that, after the rebels had been disarmed, there was a general massacre of prisoners. And that such as were not shot down on the spot were executed in batches by the Cheka, after secret trials, for some weeks after the uprising had been completely crushed. Granted it was necessary to suppress the uprising once it had reached the stage of armed rebellion, I can see no moral or political justification for such bloody reprisals. They appear rather to be the automatic, mindless, brutal product of those same bureaucratic tendencies which Lenin spent the last years of his life in fighting and which finally drove Trotsky into exile.
To see the Kronstadt uprising as flowing from the mistakes of War Communism, and to criticize the severity with which the rebels were punished – this is by no means to agree with the anarchists and the social democrats that Kronstadt “exposes the fundamentally anti-democratic and totalitarian nature of Bolshevism”. I think Kronstadt was a bad mistake, but a mistake explained and, to some extent, justified by the terrible social and economic difficulties of those early years of the revolution. (Incidentally, the book which more than any other I have read convinced me of the necessity for many of the stern and undemocratic measures taken by the Bolsheviks in these years was, oddly enough Victor Serge’s L’an Une de la Révolution Russe, a really excellent history which deserves to be issued in an English edition.) It seems to me a serious error to defend Kronstadt – and many other actions taken by the Bolsheviks in those early years – as a normal mode of behavior for a revolutionary party. I am in favor of less defense, less polemicizing against all critics on this subject, and more willingness to examine the whole affair dispassionately and objectively with a view to extracting whatever historical lessons it may hold as to what seems to me to be a key problem for all revolutionaries today: how to maintain the maximum degree of working-class democracy after the revolution has been made.



 


NEW YORK
Dwight MACDONALD



  



“There is something phoney about this war,” remarked Senator Borah the other day. He was referring to the fact that France and England declared war six weeks ago and have not yet begun to fight. But he might also have noted something phoney about the war issue as it has been presented in Congress recently. The much-advertised and long-awaited debate on neutrality legislation, in which Borah himself is a leading participant, has turned out to be pretty much of a flop. Here, too, the battle has not yet been seriously joined. The Administration forces have said nothing of their real aims and interests, which center about bringing as much help as possible to the Allies. And their “opponents,” the isolationists, have strangely acquiesced in this conspiracy of silence. It is clear that neither side has much stomach for a real fight.
 
Friendly Enemies
The truth seems to be that there is still a certain amount of division among the big bourgeoisie as to just how much of a“forward policy” in respect to the war is right now advisable. The great bulk of Wall Street opinion is without much question already behind the President’s policy – although with the caution and reservations one might expect considering the big property interests at stake. But there still remain certain powerful sections of big business inclining more, for the present, to an isolationist line. In this category, E.T. Weir of National Steel, Henry Ford, and the DuPonts are outstanding. This explains why such Republican stalwarts as Senator Vandenberg of Michigan are leading the fight against raising the arms embargo. In Vandenberg’s own state, for instance, the split is clearly defined, with General Motors for raising the embargo and Ford against it.
The politeness and gentility with which the neutrality fight has been conducted is explained by the fact that the politicians in Washington understand well enough that this difference of opinion is by no means indicative of any disagreement as to the necessity of America’s final entry into the war, but is merely a friendly disagreement as to ways and means and, above all,timing. Both sides in Congress insist that nothing is further from the minds of their honorable opponents than dragging this fail-nation into the war. There are certain accusations, after all, that come too close to home to be bandied about in public.
 
1917 and 1939
As I pointed out last week, the relationship between the government and big business has become much more intimate in the two decades of development that American monopoly capitalism has gone through since the last war. This makes it easier in one way and harder in another to expose to the masses the imperialist nature of the War Deal.
It is easier to expose the Roosevelt Administration’s war drive than it was to expose that of the Wilson Administration because this time big business has channelled its war aims through the governmental apparatus, so that the War Deal acts in a much more aggressive and whole-heartedly belligerent way than did the Wilson regime. Thus the War Deal is forced to go ahead in a more determined way, and is also forced to take on more of a Wall Street coloration than was necessary for Wilson in the years preceding our entry into the last war. (Roosevelt set uphis War Resources Board headed by Stettinius of U.S. Steel before our entry, while Wilson called on Baruch to set up the War Industries Board only after the declaration of war in 1917.)
By the same token, however, the task of exposure is harder because this time Wall Street is not making the mistake of coming out in the open and acting as the business agents and ardent propagandists of the Allied powers. The pro-war propaganda of the Roosevelt Administration seems to be quite detached from any financial interests, to be the free-will act of an independent government body – while in the last war such propaganda was crudely and openly conducted by finance capital itself.
 
Casting Out the Devil
The complexity of relations between big business and government in this war crisis is demonstrated by the recent liquidation of the War Resources Board. When the WRB was set up last summer, headed by Stettinius of the Steel Corporation and composed mostly of DuPont and Morgan executives, there was aloud outcry from liberal, labor and left-wing New Deal sources. As the debate on neutrality opened in Congress, the WRB threatened to become a really serious talking point for the isolationists. Therefore, the day before Congress met, Roosevelt suddenly announced that the WRB would meet once more, draw up a report, and then commit hari-kari. He also went out of his way to publicly humiliate and repudiate Assistant Secretary of War Johnson, author of the WRB plan and the “man” of big business in the War Department.
Loud were the outcries of victory among the liberals and the left isolationists. Actually, no more had happened than that the President, for sound reasons of immediate political strategy, had decided that the WRB had been sprung on the public a little prematurely. He therefore quietly withdrew from this too advanced position, incidentally stealing a good deal of the thunder his isolationist opponents were preparing for him in Congress. As Time (Oct. 9) put it: “About all they had left to hit him with then was the reasonable supposition that Big Steel’s Stettinius will be back on the pre-war scene in Washington at some more politic time.”
“Reasonable” is a classic understatement.
 



This week I should like to develop a little further the theme of my last column: that modern war is so vast a social undertaking and the capitalism it expresses is by now so closely integrated with the bourgeois state, as to make it impossible for old-style “private enterprise” either to fight a war or even to meet the problems of neutrality. The state simply must step in and handle matters.
In 1914–1917 the dynamic leadership of the war drive came from Wall Street, with the Wilson Administration up to the last putting on at least an appearance of opposition. This time the Roosevelt Administration is openly playing a war game, with Wall Street rather inclined to keep in the background. This is by no means to imply that this war is not, like the last one, Wall Street’s war. The basic motivation of Roosevelt’s war drive is to protect the interests and profits of American big business. And the final, fateful decision as to the time and conditions of our entry into the war will be determined in Wall Street and not in the White House.
 
Instrument of Big Business
The Roosevelt Administration is as much the instrument of the big bourgeoisie as was that of Woodrow Wilson. Even more so, indeed, since in the last two decades there has taken place, a gradual coalescence of big business and the government. This means that the relationship of Wall Street and Washington in this war is far more subtle and complicated than it was in the last war. It is not enough to perceive the basic fact that the country is being dragged into a second world slaughter in the interests of American capitalism. We must also understand just how this is being done this time. We must be aware of certain differences in technique which in turn reflect twenty-five years of development of our monopoly capitalism.
The other day the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reported to its members on the outlook for foreign trade. This report was a sermon in caution and scepticism, warning that war booms produce bad economic hangovers, and advising its members against “over-confidence.” This tone of moderation and wariness is characteristic these days of the whole financial press. On the other hand, the President whips up the war spirit with ever-increasing abandon, the current climax being his personal announcement – such dirty jobs are usually left to minor officials – that submarines “of unknown nationality” had been sighted off our coast. This bit of frank war-mongering, released just as the Congress was about to start debating neutrality legislation, got the front-page scareheads it was intended to.
 
The Morgan Myth
There is a widespread illusion, sometimes to be found even in the pages of the Appeal, that J.P. Morgan & Co. is playing exactly the same role in maneuvering America into this war it did in the last. This emphasis does not correspond with the known facts.
When the last world war hit the American economic system, no governmental measures whatever had been taken to cope with it. The financial community was hastily mobilized by the Governors of the N.Y. Stock Exchange and by the leading Wall Street bankers, headed by Mr. Morgan. But this mobilization was insufficient. The impact of war abroad and the hasty selling of large blocks of American securities by foreign holders, these caused a temporary financial panic. The Stock Exchange had to be closed for several months. There was an industrial slump before the Allies began to buy over here in big quantities.
This time, J.P. Morgan, symbolically enough, happened to be on the high seas when the war began. It would have made little difference if he had been on the spot, as he was in 1914. For one thing, the present Morgan is rather stupid, carries little weight in Wall Street, and for many years has had very little to do with running the House of Morgan. But even if he possessed the brains and the influence his father had in his day, the present J.P. Morgan would have played a rather small part in the drama. Months ago the arrangements to meet the impact of a European war on our financial system had been made, and when war actually came they were merely put into effect. This job was done neither by the Stock Exchange governors nor by the big bankers of Wall Street, but rather by the Federal agencies which now dominate the nation’s financial system: the Securities & Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve Board, and the U.S. Treasury Department. Working in close collaboration with the British Exchequer and the Bank of England, these powerful state agencies drew up plans so effectively that from the firing of the first gun in Poland, stocks began to soar, and an uninterrupted war boom began over here.
So it has been also with two other functions which the House of Morgan fulfilled for the Allies in the last war: the raising of credits over here, and the purchase of American war materials. In the first week of the war, Administration officials announced they were prepared to extend credits to the Allied nations through two governmental agencies: the Reconstruction Finance Corp, and the Export-Import Bank.
It is true that when J.P. Morgan got off the boat the other day, he said something about it being “reasonable” to assume that the Allies would call on his firm “to repeat our performance.” But this remark, which caused a great flutter in left-wing journals, turned out to be merely an indication of how much out of touch with things Mr. Morgan is these days. His partners promptly denied any such possibility, and so did the British and French governments. Officials of the War Deal disclosed that Roosevelt had advised the British government against allowing the House of Morgan to give an encore of its famous 1914 performance. As T.R.B. cynically notes in the Sept. 27 New Republic:
“The advice was sensible. To create pro-English sentiment among the mass of voters here, the House of Morgan should be kept out of sight ... In 1914–1917, the English government had Ambassador Page to help them influence American opinion: in this war they seem to have done much better.”
 
A Matter of Scale
But it is not only for propagandistic reasons that the House of Morgan is not being called in again by the Allies. The main reason is that today Government agencies rather than Wall Street bankers control the technical workings of our financial system. (The basic control of the system, of course, remains in the hands of big business. It has merely been found advisable, for the benefit not of “the people” but of business interests, to centralize technical management in Washington.) This is true in times of peace, and it is truer than ever now that war has enlarged the problems of capitalism to abnormal size.
An anonymous “financier” put the essence of the matter pretty well when he was quoted in the N.Y. World-Telegram of Sept. 14 as follows:
“Buying materials is not a banking firm’s function anyway. When J.P. Morgan & Co. went into it in the last war, everyone thought the fight would be over quickly and the work could be done. Then it turned out to be a gigantic undertaking. It expanded tremendously. Buying for this war is expected to begin at the same scale and may go on from there to something which would dwarf the imagination.”
The French have already announced that all their purchases will, for the time being, clear through the commercial attaché of their embassy in Washington. There is also a semi-official report that a Franco-British joint purchasing agency will be set up in Canada to arrange all purchases in North America. This agency, it is expected, will work closely with the procurement division of the U.S. Treasury.
War today is just, too vast an enterprise for even the most powerful private bankers to handle. If war hasn’t been exactly socialized, it has at least reached the stage of government ownership. It goes without saying that, as in the case of other forms of government ownership under capitalism, the change is made in the general interests of monopoly capitalism.
 



This week I am turning over this department to the National Industrial Conference Board, a statistical and research agency financed by big business. In 1929 the Board published a volume entitled A Picture of World Economic Conditions at the Beginning of 1929. This was a most cheerful and optimistic work: the booming twenties were at their highest period of prosperity, war had been “outlawed” by the Kellogg Pact, and all was for the best in the best of all possible worlds. The speed and extent of the collapse of world capitalism since then is, of course, a dramatic proof of the superiority of Marxist to bourgeois economic theory. And an excellent index as to just how catastrophically world capitalism has gone to pieces in the last decade is to be found in the opening pages of this 1929 survey. So without further comment on my part, which would be merely gilding the lily – I turn over this column to the National Industrial Conference Board.
 
“A Universal Will to Maintain Peace”
“The year 1928,” begins the first chapter, “has witnessed many noteworthy developments in the field of international relations and in economic and political conditions in individual countries. These developments have on the whole been favorable to a continuation of the progress which has been made in recent years towards a complete recovery from the numerous and deep-seated maladies caused by the unprecedented economic and political upheaval of ten years ago. The formation of the League of Nations: the creation of the World Court; the establishment of the Dawes Plan; the Disarmament Conference in Washington;the admission of Germany to the League; the conclusion of the Locarno treaties; and finally, the signing of the Multilateral Treaty for the Renunciation of War by the United States, France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and ten other nations in Paris on August 27, 1928 – all indicate that the nations of the world are replacing the old system of checks and balances. Ententes and defensive and offensive alliances by a new conception of international relations based on mutual understanding and a universal will to maintain peace.
 
Enter the “Practical Business Man”
“In their efforts to maintain harmonious relations among the nations, the governments have been materially assisted by private individuals. The work of diplomats and statesmen, of military experts and professional politicians is being supplemented by that of practical business men, leaders of industry and finance, economists and statisticians. At no other time in the history of the world has the cooperation of public officers and private enterprise been so intimate and so forceful as during the last few years. Often in the past, the conflict of commercial interests has been the cause of, or the excuse for, war largely because the representatives of industry and trade had no opportunity to sit around a table and discuss their difficulties in a friendly manner. The growing influence of private business on state policies is a most encouraging sign of our era. A business man knows that the prosperity of his business is bound up with the general prosperity of his country; and this principle he applies to international relations: the prosperity of his country can not be maintained at the expense of other nations . The leaders of industry are trying to eliminate one of the causes of war – unreasonable and illegitimate competition for world markets.
 
Peace on Earth ...
“The signing of the Multilateral Treaty for the Renunciation of War on August 27, 1928, by representatives of fifteen nations has been hailed throughout the world as a most significant contribution towards the advancement of peace ... As finally adopted and signed, the Treaty is a plain declaration on the part of the signatory powers that they ‘condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.’ ...
“The right of all states to wage a defensive war is not denied by the Treaty, nor does the Treaty define what constitutes a defensive war. Each nation is ... the sole judge of what constitutes the right of self defense and the necessity and extent of the same ... The Treaty does not restrict the right of France, for example, to fight for Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Rumania, or Jugoslavia, her allies ...
“The Treaty enunciates a great moral principle ... It would be useless to speculate what the practical value of the Treaty will be, but there seems to be no doubt that it is a step in the right direction. For this reason, the signing of the Anti-War treaty stands out as the most notable achievement of 1928.
“The Kellogg Treaty is also responsible for the negotiations for the conclusion of treaties of mutual friendship between Russia and her other neighbors, particularly with Poland ...
“On the basis of a detailed analysis of the whole field of Germany’s economic life, the Agent General for Reparation Payments concludes that ‘Fundamentally, confidence has been restored, and Germany has been re-established as a going concern on a relatively high level of economic activity.’
“Among the so-called Succession States, which came into existence as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, Czechoslovakia has shown the greatest economic power and political stability.”
 
The “Practical Business Man” Again
It is only fair to say that the National Industrial Conference Board arrived at the conclusions quoted above in the most impeccably scientific manner. For each of these fantastic (as of 1939) misjudgements, there was the soundest statistical foundation. As President Alexander of the Board puts it in his Preface to the volume:
“In the preparation of its publications, the National Industrial Conference Board avails itself of the experience and judgement of the business executives who compose its membership and of recognized authorities in special fields ... The publications of the Board thus finally represent the result of scientific investigation and broad business experience.”
In other words, the National Industrial Conference Board is a solid, responsible scholarly institution which goes haywire only along lines approved of by the best business and statistical brains of the country. Its fantasies are not its own individual daydreams but the hallucinations of the ruling class as a whole.
 




Footnote on International Law
In a recent issue of Time, John J. Clarke, of Beverley Hills, California, says more in two sentences than has been said to date in the entire Neutrality Law debate in Congress. Mr. Clarke’s sentences: “The President’s message on Neutrality evidenced a desire to return to International Law. The interesting thing about International Law is that the only way to enforce it is by war.”
 

The Swag
The old-fashioned nineteenth century type of imperialist conquest was, in essence, straight robbery. But it was veiled by the fact it was indirect – a matter of “spheres of influence,” of “opening up new markets” and “bringing civilization to backward peoples.” “Take up the white man’s burden!” exhorted Kipling in 1899, presenting imperialism as a Salvation Army movement to uplift the darker-skinned peoples of the world.
The Nazis have stripped away these pretensions from imperialism, as they have carried other tendencies of capitalism to their blunt, naked logical conclusion. Hitler’s imperialism is reduced to its simplest terms: as direct a matter of banditry as any bank robbery. When the Reichswehr moves into a new country, its first concern is The Swag. Banks, insurance companies, fraternal and trade union funds – all possible reservoirs of cash and credit, are picked clean, their assets being immediately transferred to Berlin. The Reichswehr functions as a strong-arm crew for the Reichsbank.
This is a factor which has a real effect on Hitler’s economic staying-power in the war. Every new conquest is, in the most concrete financial terms, a loss to the Allies and a gain to Hitler. The German Institute for Bank Research and Science recently issued a report on Polish industries. This showed that 43% of the total shares in Polish corporations are held by foreign capital – an index to the backward nature of Polish economy and one explanation for the so dramatically exposed hollowness and rottenness of the Polish ruling class. Of these shares, some $60,610,000 worth were owned by French interests, some $52,600,000 by American interests, and so on. All of this loot now goes into the Reich’s coffers – except, of course, for Comrade Stalin’s cut.
 

The Great International Bank Robbery
The sums just mentioned are invested in plant and equipment, and are not readily convertible into cash, the most pressing need of the Nazi state in this war. No doubt the Reichswehr has been also sending back to Berlin large amounts of cold cash from Poland just as it did from Czechoslovakia. But these conquests have also opened up to the Reich another reservoir of gold: the Bank for International Settlements, an institution in Basel, Switzerland, whose resources are owned jointly by the central banks of the world. Writing in the of October 22, R.H. Fetridge describes this international bank stick-up. Every time the Reichswehr takes over a country, the Reichsbank takes over its gold deposits in the B.I.S. The Czechoslovak job netted $25,000,000 in gold, Danzig and Poland have yielded an undisclosed additional sum. “Despite angry protests from Great Britain,” writes Mr. Fetridge, “no way has been found to prevent the transfers of these gold deposits.” The Bank of London was able to prevent Hitler getting hold of the Czech gold on deposit in London, but the B.I.S. is in neutral Switzerland.
 

The Hitler Mob Takes Over
Furthermore, the Nazis now have working control of the B.I.S. When the bank was founded, each of the chief nations participating had 19,000 shares – England, France, Germany, the United States, Italy, Japan, and Belgium. But naturally every fresh Nazi conquest has added shares to the original 19,000. Poland alone has yielded 4,000 BIS shares. Germany now holds the imposing total of 31,700 shares. The English and French members of the bank’s board refuse to attend meetings any more. They would like to liquidate the bank, but there is a provision in the by-laws that this can be done only by a three-fourths vote of the shareholders, a majority impossible to get without Germany and her friends.
The board meetings of the BIS these days must be comic affairs, with the Nazi bandits solemnly insisting on everything being done according to full legal forms. They have not only stuck up the bank, but have at the same time installed themselves as its chief stockholders. And to add spice to the joke, the new president of the bank is an American T.H. McKittrick, of the respectable old banking firm of Higginson & Co.
Thus ends another of the attempts made in the twenties to bring some law and order into world capitalism. The BIS was one of those experiments in international cooperation like the Kellogg Anti-War Declaration, the World Court, and the League of Nations. Its purpose was to provide an orderly way for adjusting international financial relationships in the chaotic post-war period. But its chief effect has been to aid the power which above all others refuses to abide by any of the rules of the game, and aggressively threatens the order and stability which the BIS was founded to establish. Just as the League of Nations was used as an instrument of power politics by the then strongest European imperialist group – England and France – so the BIS is now being manipulated by the Nazis. Such is the inevitable fate of all such schemes to establish “order,” “justice,” and “cooperation” in a system which more and more reverts to the brute law of the jungle for its real, as against its officially proclaimed, code of conduct.
