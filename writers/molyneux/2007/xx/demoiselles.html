<p class="fst">This year marks the centenary of the painting of <em>Les
Demoiselles d&#8217;Avignon</em> by Pablo Picasso. There cannot be many
paintings whose anniversary would occasion an analysis in a journal
of socialist theory &#8211; an honour usually reserved for revolutions
and other great events in the history of the class struggle &#8211;
nevertheless <em>Les Demoiselles</em> certainly repays serious
consideration. Aside from its individual stature as one of the
outstanding paintings of the 20th century, there is its enormous
importance as a turning point in the history of art and, indeed,
wider cultural history, and also its powerful resonance today.</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Les Demoiselles d&#8217;avignon</em> is an oil painting on canvas
begun by Picasso in late 1906 and completed in the summer of 1907. It
is eight feet tall, seven feet eight inches wide, and has hung since
1937 in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The painting depicts
five nude women, clearly prostitutes in a brothel. Of the three women
on the left, the leftmost is shown side on, apparently drawing back a
curtain to reveal the others, and the second and third are shown
frontally, staring straight out of the canvass. The depiction of all
three women, especially the head of the furthest left, is influenced
by Ancient Iberian (pre-historic &#8220;Spanish&#8221;) sculpture that
Picasso had seen the previous year in the Louvre. The two women on
the right, one standing slightly in the background between curtains,
the other squatting in the foreground, have been given heads that
resemble the African sculptures or masks that the artist is known to
have seen in the Mus&#233;e d&#8217;Ethnographie du Trocad&#233;ro. The bodies of
all the women are rendered by means of flat, angular planes of colour
with little shading or modelling. Jutting out at the centre of the
bottom of the painting is a bowl of fruit &#8211; a melon, grapes, pear
and apple. The painting received its title not from Picasso but from
his friend Andr&#233; Salmon in 1916, and it is either, depending on
interpretation, euphemistic or ironic for it refers to a brothel or
brothels on the Carrer d&#8217;Avinyo in Barcelona, of which Picasso
evidently had personal experience.</p>

<p>So much for the basic facts. By far the most frequent comment on
<em>Les Demoiselles</em>, in both journalism and art history, is that
it marks &#8220;the birth of modern art&#8221;. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
Let us first consider the justification for, and truth of, this bold claim.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western"><em>Les Demoiselles</em> and modern art</h4>

<p class="fst">The simplest, most widespread, distinction between &#8220;traditional
art&#8221; (by which is meant European art from about 1300 onwards) and
&#8220;modern art&#8221; is that the former was engaged, at a minimum (it did
other, more important, things as well) in the attempt to imitate the
appearance of people, objects and scenes in the real world, whereas
the latter is not. Traditional art is commonly portrayed as
representational, naturalistic or &#8220;realistic&#8221; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>,
whereas modern art either wilfully distorts physical appearances or,
in abstract art, abandons them altogether. There are numerous
problems with this crude distinction, not least the difficulty
involved in regarding paintings of Madonnas, angels and Venuses as
&#8220;realistic&#8221;, but there is also clearly some truth in it. At least
the faces of the Madonnas, the tunics of the angels and the breasts
of the Venuses looked like observable faces, tunics and breasts. And
while some &#8220;traditional&#8221; artists (Hans Holbein, John Constable,
Gustave Courbet) are more mimetic (imitative) than others (Sandro
Botticelli, Hieronymus Bosch, El Greco) and some &#8220;moderns&#8221; (Paul
Klee, Wassily Kandinsky) more expressionist or abstract than others
(Amedeo Modigliani, Pierre Bonnard), one has only to compare a
representative list of traditionals with a similar list of moderns to
get the point &#8211; on the one hand Van Eyck, Piero della Francesca,
Titian, Rembrandt, Diego Vel&#225;zquez, Thomas Gainsborough, Francisco
Goya, Edouard Manet and Vincent van Gogh who, despite the immense
differences between them, were all engaged in producing recognisable
images of persons and things; on the other hand Georges Braque,
Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich, Piet Mondrian, Max Ernst, Joan Mir&#243;,
Jackson Pollock, and Mark Rothko who, despite their differences, were not.</p>

<p>The tipping point between the two &#8211; the clearest, most decisive
assault on the past, the key breakthrough to the new &#8211; is indeed
<em>Les Demoiselles d&#8217;Avignon</em>. Before <em>Les Demoiselles</em>
even Picasso&#8217;s own work, his blue and rose periods, was clearly a
continuation of the mimetic tradition, closer in many ways to
Rembrandt, Goya, Manet and Van Gogh than to his work of one, two or
three years later. <em>Les Demoiselles</em> opens the floodgates,
first to cubism and then in rapid succession to futurism, synthetic
cubism, expressionism, vorticism, abstraction, suprematism, dadaism
and more besides. Within just ten years artists were producing works,
such as Malevich&#8217;s <em>Black Square on White</em> and Duchamp&#8217;s
ready-mades, which would not previously have been regarded as art at
all (and were not so regarded by the majority at the time), but which
have subsequently achieved, at least within the art world, classic
and iconic status. <em>Les Demoiselles</em> is a veritable revolution
in paint &#8211; the art equivalent of the French Revolution, indeed of
the Storming of the Bastille.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of traditional art, very closely bound up
with its naturalism, was the high level of craft skills it involved
and demanded. These skills, developed particularly in the 16th and
17th century, lay especially in the precise rendering of surfaces:
lace, satin, velvet, sable, glass, silver, feathers, flesh tones, the
folds in drapery or robes and so on. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>
This is reflected in the way people commonly talk about art &#8211; &#8221;Look
at the detail!&#8221; or, &#8220;It makes you feel as if you can touch it&#8221;
&#8211; and for many it was these skills that served as the surest
guarantee of artistic quality, of the status of traditional paintings
as &#8220;real&#8221; or &#8220;great&#8221; art. In retrospect it can be seen that
the premium on these skills was waning from Claude Monet and
impressionism onwards, but it was <em>Les Demoiselles</em> that was
the decisive break. In 1907 it would have looked like not just a move
away from the traditional skills, but a full-scale assault on them.
This was the beginning of art which would provoke the outraged cry,
&#8220;My four year old can do better than that!&#8221;</p>

<p>For centuries, roughly from the Renaissance to the 19th century,
&#8220;beauty&#8221; was a, perhaps the, dominant concept in aesthetic
theory, the value, together with the closely related &#8220;harmonious
form&#8221;, to which it was held that art should aspire. Of course there
was always art which could not reasonably be described as beautiful,
for example the dark fantasies of Bosch or William Hogarth&#8217;s
satirical series (<em>Marriage &#225; la Mode</em>, <em>The Rake&#8217;s
Progress</em>, etc), but such work was generally deemed of a lower
order than that of artists such as Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da
Vinci and, especially, Raphael, where beauty and harmonious form were
more clearly in evidence. The philosophers Edmund Burke and Immanuel
Kant supplemented &#8220;beauty&#8221; with the concept of &#8220;the sublime&#8221;
to accommodate works, such as Michelangelo&#8217;s <em>Last Judgment</em>,
which, if not beautiful, were manifestly awe inspiring. Above all,
the concept of beauty ruled the genre of the female nude, where it
had the added advantage of masking or providing an alibi for the
issue of sexual desirability and lust. In the tradition of nude
painting that stretches through Botticelli, Giorgione, Titian,
Rubens, Vel&#225;zquez, Goya, Ingres and Renoir the aim of the artists
was always to present their female subjects as beautiful. (Rembrandt
is, I think, the only significant exception prior to the 19th
century.) Clear inroads into this tradition were made by Manet&#8217;s
<em>Olympia</em>, Paul C&#233;zanne&#8217;s <em>Bathers</em> series, and
Toulouse Lautrec&#8217;s brothel scenes, but again it is with <em>Les
Demoiselles</em> that the sharpest confrontation takes place. Picasso
not only does not attempt to make the women &#8220;beautiful&#8221; but, by
the use of the African masks, positively insists on their ugliness
(by the conventional standards of the day).</p>

<p>The enormously disturbing newness of <em>Les Demoiselles</em> is
confirmed by the reaction, not of the public or the critics, but of
Picasso&#8217;s &#8211; avant_garde artist friends when they first saw it in
his studio. Both Henri Matisse and Georges Braque were at first
repelled by it. Braque suggested that Picasso had been &#8220;drinking
turpentine and spitting fire&#8221; <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>,
while Andr&#233; Derain is alleged to have claimed that &#8220;some day
Picasso would hang himself behind his canvas&#8221;. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western"><em>Les Demoiselles</em> and theories of modernism</h4>

<p class="fst">There have been, of course, a number of more rounded and
theoretically sophisticated accounts of the emergence of modern art
than the simple distinctions discussed so far. Probably the most
influential, at least within the art world, is that of the American
art critic Clement Greenberg. Greenberg established himself by being
the principal champion of abstract expressionism, and for 20 years or
so (roughly the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s) was the leading art
critic in America and, therefore, the world. His status in art
criticism approximated to that of John Maynard Keynes in economics or
F.R. Leavis in literature. Greenberg began in the late 1930s as at
least a semi-Marxist in the Trotskyist influenced milieu around
<strong>Partisan Review</strong>, but during and after the Second World War
moved, like so many, towards a mainstream or right wing liberalism
and in the process became a rigorous formalist in matters of art
criticism and history, rejecting, more or less absolutely, any
discussion of the content or social context of artworks.</p>

<p>For Greenberg, modernism was more than art and literature: it
included &#8220;almost the whole of what is truly alive in our culture&#8221;
<a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a>, and its essence lay &#8220;in the use of
the characteristic methods of a discipline to criticise the
discipline itself &#8211; not in order to subvert it, but to entrench it
more firmly in its area of competence&#8221;. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>
Each art form had to demonstrate in practice that the kind of
experience it provided was not to be obtained from any other
activity. This meant each art form systematically shedding all
conventions not essential to its survival as art, and focusing with
increasing intensity on its unique and defining characteristics. In
the case of painting this was the making of marks on a
two-dimensional surface:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The limitations that constitute the medium of painting &#8211;
the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of pigment
&#8211; were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be
acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Modernist painting has
come to regard these same limitations as positive factors that are to
be acknowledged openly. Manet&#8217;s paintings became the first
modernist ones by virtue of the frankness with which they declared
the surfaces on which they were painted ... It was the stressing,
however, of the ineluctable flatness of the support that remained
most fundamental in the processes by which pictorial art criticised
and defined itself under modernism. Flatness alone was unique and
exclusive to that art ... and so modernist painting oriented itself
to flatness as it did to nothing else. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Greenberg&#8217;s account cannot be accepted as adequate or
satisfactory. First, it treats the development of art as almost
completely (and quite implausibly) autonomous from society, history
and politics (except in the very last analysis of the existence of
&#8220;modern&#8221; society). Second, it operates by the sleight of hand of
simply excluding from the canon of modernism all painting not
participating in the project of flatness (for example surrealism,
Diego Rivera and the Mexican muralists or Francis Bacon).
Nevertheless, the history of European art from about 1850 to 1950
shows that Greenberg has identified a real and important tendency.
From Manet, through impressionism, Gauguin, C&#233;zanne, cubism,
Kandinsky and Mondrian, to Pollock and abstract expressionism, one
can clearly see the compression of the three-dimensional picture
space, which had been opened up in the 14th and 15th centuries. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>
It is like watching a stage in which the backdrop moves ever closer
to the apron until it has squeezed out, in Greenberg&#8217;s words, &#8220;the
kind of space that recognisable three-dimensional objects can
inhabit&#8221;. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>There is no single painting that so clearly illustrates and
exemplifies Greenberg&#8217;s argument as <em>Les Demoiselles</em>: the
stripping away of inessential conventions, the replacement of
sculptural modelling by flat planes, the extreme compression of space
between background and foreground &#8211; all these undergo a qualitative
intensification in this work.</p>

<p>If, however, we turn to more Marxist theorisations of modern art
<em>Les Demoiselles</em> retains its pivotal role. John Berger does
not fully discuss modernism as such, but he clearly regards cubism as
the crucial modern movement and the revolutionary art of the 20th
century. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> For Berger, cubism
synthesises the materialism of Gustave Courbet and the dialectics of
C&#233;zanne, and is a response to the scientific and technical
breakthroughs of the period (Max Planck, Albert Einstein,
electricity, the Eiffel Tower, the aeroplane, etc) and the positive
economic promise of monopoly capitalism (the possibility of a world
of material plenty and equality) before it was dashed by war and
fascism. But for Berger it was by painting <em>Les Demoiselles</em>
that &#8220;Picasso provoked cubism. It was the spontaneous and ...
primitive insurrection out of which, for good historical reasons, the
revolution of cubism developed.&#8221; <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>Perry Anderson&#8217;s account of modernism in his article <em>Modernity
and Revolution</em> has a similar point of departure to Berger, but is
more systematic and is applied to the culture as a whole, not just
painting:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In my view, &#8220;modernism&#8221; can best be understood as a
cultural field triangulated by three decisive coordinates. The first
... was the codification of a highly formalised academicism in the
visual and other arts, which itself was institutionalised within
official regimes of states and society still massively pervaded,
often dominated, by aristocratic or landowning classes ... The second
coordinate is ... the still incipient, hence essentially novel,
emergence within these societies of the key technologies or
inventions of the second industrial revolution: telephone, radio,
automobile, aircraft and so on ... The third coordinate ... was the
imaginative proximity of social revolution. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst"><em>Les Demoiselles</em> fits neatly into this schema. French art
remained dominated by the aristocratic Academy with its annual salons
more or less until the end of the 19th century, and Manet, the
impressionists, and the post-impressionists (Seurat, C&#233;zanne,
Gauguin, Van Gogh) were all met with derision. The automobile is
developed, essentially, in the 1890s in Germany and France, and the
first mass production is undertaken in the US in 1902. The Wright
Brothers made the first powered flights in December 1903 and in
September 1906 Santos Dumont made a public flight in Paris. Guglielmo
Marconi established the world&#8217;s first radio station in 1897 on the
Isle of Wight, and opened the first wireless factory in Chelmsford in
1898. Above all the attention of Europe was captured by the 1905
Revolution in Russia. Moreover, if we examine the chronology of the
landmarks of the modernist revolution in the other art forms we find
that <em>Les Demoiselles</em>, almost invariably, precedes them: in
music, Igor Stravinsky&#8217;s <em>Firebird</em> was composed in 1910,
and <em>The Rite of Spring</em> between 1912 and 1913, while the
Ballets Russes was formed 1909 and first performed <em>L&#8217;Apr&#232;s-midi
d&#8217;un Faune</em> in 1912; in literature Marcel Proust&#8217;s <strong>A la
Recherche du Temps Perdu</strong> was begun in 1909, James Joyce&#8217;s
<strong>Dubliners</strong> appeared in 1914, Franz Kafka&#8217;s <strong>In the Penal
Colony</strong> in 1914 and his <strong>Metamorphosis</strong> in 1915.</p>
<p>Even from the standpoint of Georg Luk&#225;cs, the principal Marxist
opponent of modernism, I think it would be fair to say that <em>Les
Demoiselles</em> exemplifies many of the tendencies &#8211;
fragmentation, absence of perspective, abandonment of totality &#8211;
which he held against modernism.</p>

<p>Of course one can push this too far. From a wider perspective,
such as that of Marshall Berman in his powerful work, <strong>All That is
Solid Melts into Air</strong>, &#8220;modernism&#8221; is a cultural response to
the whole experience of &#8220;modernity&#8221;, ie modern capitalism, not
the product of any individual work or artist &#8211; and this is surely
right. Modern art and modernism would have happened in some form
regardless of whether <em>Les Demoiselles</em> had been painted.
Indeed in this wider view modernism long pre-dates Picasso,
stretching back, perhaps, to Kant and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe or
in painting to David and Goya, or Th&#233;odore G&#233;ricault and Courbet.
Perhaps what we really need is the idea of two modernisms: one
encompassing the progressive culture of the whole epoch inaugurated
by the French and industrial revolutions and still continuing today;
the other deriving from the specific conjuncture analysed by Anderson
and Berger and lasting until the Second World War, which perhaps
could be called High Modernism (on the model of the High Renaissance
or High Stalinism). This would have the advantage of combining
Berger&#8217;s broad dynamic vision with Anderson&#8217;s rigour, without the
latter&#8217;s numbing pessimism and the door it opens to postmodernism. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless this broad view does not negate the role played by
<em>Les Demoiselles</em> at a crucial historical moment, or its
exceptional influence on the tempo and form of modernism&#8217;s
development. Just as the knowledge that Lenin did not cause or create
the Russian Revolution does not exclude the fact that his part in it
was greater that of any other single individual, so understanding the
wider historical determination of modernism is perfectly compatible
with recognising the exceptional role of this particular work.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The Power of <em>Les Demoiselles</em></h4>

<p class="fst">I have so far discussed the impact of <em>Les Demoiselles</em> on
the development of modern art in purely formal terms, and that was
indeed the nature of its influence &#8211; it produced a flood of cubist
paintings of men with guitars and cafe tables, not a flood of
paintings of prostitutes. Nevertheless it would not and could not
have had this massive formal influence if it had not been such an
exceptionally powerful painting in its own right, that is if its
formal innovations had not been seen by other artists (especially
Braque) to work in practice. And the moment we consider or analyse
the power of <em>Les Demoiselles</em> as an individual painting we
have to deal with its subject matter, and see its formal qualities as
a way of treating that subject matter. In other words we must view
the painting as a totality, a particular fusion or unity of form and content.</p>

<p>This brings us to the simple and inescapable fact that <em>Les
Demoiselles</em> is a picture of five prostitutes and is about
prostitution. However, it is striking how many art historical and
journalistic accounts do try to escape this fact or, at least, to
avoid any serious discussion of it. <strong>Guardian</strong> art critic
Jonathan Jones argues, &#8220;Most of all, this is a painting about
looking ... it&#8217;s misguided to see [it] as a painting &#8216;about&#8217;
brothels, prostitutes or colonialism.&#8221; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a>
This is evasion. Yes, it is about looking, but precisely about
looking at, and being looked at by, prostitutes. Everything in the
picture&#8217;s composition reinforces this. Many paintings position us
when we look at them &#8211; Titian&#8217;s <em>Venus d&#8217;Urbino</em> makes
us the courtesan/Venus&#8217;s lover or patron, Manet&#8217;s <em>A Bar at
the Folies Berg&#232;res</em> makes us a customer ordering a drink &#8211;
but <em>Les Demoiselles</em> fixes us more definitively than any work
I can think of: as the client of the brothel for whom the women are
displaying themselves. The phallic bowl of fruit jutting upwards in
the centre foreground becomes our phallus leading us into the brothel
and towards the women. Thus the painting stages an &#8220;in our face&#8221;
confrontation with the institution of prostitution.</p>

<p>But if <em>Les Demoiselles</em> is &#8220;about&#8221; prostitution, what
exactly is it saying about prostitution?</p>

<p>There is, in the literature, a biographical story which purports
to answer this question and thus to &#8220;explain&#8221; the meaning of the
painting. Picasso had a friend who died of syphilis, having been
infected by a prostitute, and, according to these accounts, <em>Les
Demoiselles</em> is an expression of the fear and anger felt by
Picasso as a result. But, regardless of the truth or otherwise of
this story, it does not account, or accounts only very partially, for
the nature and power of the finished work, which is making a more
general statement. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>According to John Berger that general statement is &#8220;a raging,
frontal attack, not against sexual &#8216;immorality&#8217;, but against life
as Picasso found it &#8211; the waste, the disease, the ugliness, and the
ruthlessness of it ... instead of criticising modern life by
comparing it, as much in sorrow as in anger, with a more primitive
way of life, he now uses his sense of the primitive to violate and
shock the civilised ... He is not in the least concerned with formal
problems. He is concerned with challenging civilisation. The
dislocations in this picture are the result of aggression, not
aesthetics.&#8221; <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p>But, if the syphilis story is too narrow, Berger&#8217;s &#8220;rage
against civilisation&#8221; is too broad. He is right about the element
of rage in the painting, but insufficiently precise in identifying
its target, again evading the issue of prostitution. Partly, I think,
Berger is led astray by following the conventional view of the
African heads on the women on the right as aggressive. My own view is
that they are not intrinsically either frightening or savage and that
they are present in the painting for two reasons: first because in
African art, art from a pre-capitalist society, Picasso had found an
important source for a new, non-naturalistic way of representing the
world; second, in terms of the content of the painting, they occur
precisely as masks, as blocking mechanisms behind which the real
features of the women are concealed. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p>A number of feminist art historians have seen the rage as directed
primarily against women as such, and have viewed <em>Les Demoiselles</em>
as a highly misogynistic painting. One of the most forceful of these,
Carol Duncan, argues that the emergence of modern art coincided with
women starting to claim equality (she cites the suffragist movement)
and that a great deal of modern art expressed a defensive male sexist
reaction to this:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Indeed, as women&#8217;s claims to full humanity grew, the
more relentlessly would art rationalise their inferior status ... In
fact, the defence of male supremacy must be recognised as a central
theme in modern art. Gauguin, Munch, Rodin, Matisse, Picasso and
scores of other artists, consciously or unconsciously, identified
some aspect of the sexist cause with all or part of their own
artistic missions. Art celebrating sexist experience was accorded the
greatest prestige, given the most pretentious aesthetic rationales,
and identified with the highest and deepest of human aspirations.
Nudes and whores &#8211; women with no identity beyond their existence as
sex objects &#8211; were made to embody transcendent, &#8220;universally&#8221;
significant statements ... the image of the whore even came to stand
for woman in her purest, most concentrated form. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">For Duncan <em>Les Demoiselles</em> is the epitome of this sexist trend:</p>

<p class="quoteb">What is so remarkable about this work is the way it
manifests the structural foundation underlying both the femme fatale
and the new primitive woman. Picasso ... dredged up from his psyche
the terrifying and fascinating beast that gave birth to both of them.
The <em>Desmoiselles</em> prismatically mirrors her many opposing
faces: whore and deity, decadent and savage, tempting and repelling,
awesome and obscene, looming and crouching, masked and naked,
threatening and powerless. In that jungle-brothel is womankind in all
her present and past metamorphoses, concealing and revealing herself
before the male ... Picasso presents her in the form of a desecrated
icon already slashed and torn to bits ... no other work reveals more
of the rock foundation of sexist anti_humanism or goes further and
deeper to justify and celebrate the domination of woman by man. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Duncan&#8217;s comments on modern art in general have some truth in
them, certainly more than is usually recognised in conventional art
history. It is also true that Picasso&#8217;s life, and some of his art,
provides evidence of sexist attitudes. It is even the case that there
is anger, misogynistic anger, in Picasso&#8217;s depiction of the Avignon
prostitutes. Nevertheless, I believe Duncan&#8217;s judgment of <em>Les
Demoiselles</em> is fundamentally mistaken and this brings us to
heart of what the painting is about and the nature and cause of its power.</p>

<p>The central feature of <em>Les Demoiselles</em> is the
confrontation between the artist/brothel client/viewer &#8211; at this
moment they are one and the same &#8211; and the gaze of the central
women (second and third from the left). Yes, he and we enter the
brothel and look at the prostitutes with anger, but this look, and
this anger, is returned in spades (if I may use the card playing
metaphor) in the implacable gaze of the prostitutes, which functions
as both an expression of their situation and feelings, and as a
mirror reflecting back his/ours. Thus <em>Les Demoiselles</em>, far
from being crudely sexist or simply misogynistic, is a uniquely
intense and dramatic depiction of the mutual antagonism, estrangement
and alienation involved in the institution of prostitution.</p>

<p>Bourgeois society oscillates between two attitudes to
prostitution: on the one hand moral condemnation and legal
persecution of the prostitute (largely the department of the church,
the police and the courts); on the other hand, sometimes sentimental,
sometimes <em>risqu&#233;</em>, glamorisation, largely the province of the
arts. In the latter, Hollywood has played its part but so has &#8220;high
art&#8221; (Titian&#8217;s <em>Venus d&#8217;Urbino</em>, Boucher&#8217;s and
Ingres&#8217;s <em>Odalisques</em>). In both cases what is evaded is the
economic deprivation and emotional trauma which lead women into
prostitution, and the sexual deprivation and emotional alienation
which lead men to prostitutes.</p>

<p>Once this is grasped it also becomes evident that the formal
innovations, which had such an impact on the course of art, all
contribute to the intensity of the dramatic confrontation that is <em>Les
Demoiselles</em>. Picasso needed the radical break with traditional
forms of naturalistic representation, needed the assault on
conventional standards of beauty, needed the African masks, to smash
and eliminate any traces of sentimentality and glamorisation. Above
all Picasso needed the flattening, the extreme foreshortening of
space in the painting, to thrust the women into our faces, to stage
this eyeball to eyeball confrontation between us and them, client and
prostitute, and to cut through the ingrained habit of evasion of the
reality of prostitution. And it is precisely the success of <em>Les
Demoiselles</em> in achieving this that makes it so genuinely
shocking, not just to Braque and Matisse a hundred years ago, but to
us today, when its formal qualities have long become familiar. To
look at <em>Les Demoiselles</em> is still to receive the visual
equivalent of a sharp slap across the face.</p>

<p>The issue of prostitution is still very much with us, and in all
its forms from the concentrated hatred of the Ipswich murders, and
the extreme exploitation and alienation of the virtual slave trade in
women from Eastern Europe and elsewhere, to the milder, but
insidious, relegitimisation of sexism through lap dancing, lads&#8217;
mags and raunch culture.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is more involved and more at stake here than just
the critique of one particular social institution. Bourgeois
society&#8217;s mystification of prostitution and evasion of its
realities (replicated in the art critics&#8217; evasion of the real
content of <em>Les Demoiselles</em>) is habitual not just because of
the hypocrisy of so many bourgeois politicians, priests and
moralists, preaching &#8220;family values&#8221; in public while privately
behaving quite otherwise, but because what the commodification of sex
does to the human relations between the people involved is
symptomatic of what alienation and commodification (i.e. capitalism)
do to human relations as a whole. Marx explained this with great clarity:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Prostitution is only a <em>specific</em> expression of
the <em>general</em> prostitution of the <em>labourer</em>, and since
it is a relationship in which not the prostitute alone, but also the
one who prostitutes, fall &#8211; and the latter&#8217;s abomination is still
greater &#8211; the capitalist, etc., also comes under this head. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Of course, it is not my argument that Picasso was intellectually
conscious of all of this. We do not, and cannot, know exactly what
passed through his mind as he worked on <em>Les Demoiselles</em>, and
paintings are rarely visual illustrations of intellectual theses. My
guess would be that Picasso worked part consciously, part
intuitively, and was concerned more with the representation of
feelings than of thought out ideas. But this is not really the point.
What we have to work with and respond to is the painting itself, and
this confronts us with the fact &#8211; surely a significant one &#8211; that
the picture which revolutionised art was a hugely powerful statement
of rage at the commodification of sex and life.</p>

<h3 class="western">Notes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> See for example, Wullschlager,
2007, or Jones, 2007.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f2" name="n2">2.</a> I am using &#8220;realistic&#8221; here in
the way it is used in everyday language, the media and mainstream art
history, which basically accepts the method of representing the world
-developed in the Renaissance as true realism, and not in the
specific Marxist sense developed by Frederick Engels, Georg Luk&#225;cs
and others. Luk&#225;cs distinguished between &#8220;naturalism&#8221;, the more
or less accurate depiction of surface appearances, and &#8220;realism&#8221;,
which penetrated surface appearances to reveal the real driving
forces in society. Luk&#225;cs developed this distinction in relation to
literature, so that for him Honor&#233; de Balzac was a great realist,
whereas &#233;mile Zola was merely a naturalist, and &#8220;the central
aesthetic problem of realism is the adequate presentation of the
complete human personality&#8221; (Luk&#225;cs, 1948). It can perhaps be
applied to some &#8220;traditional&#8221; (i.e. European 1300&#8211;1900) visual
art, so that Rembrandt&#8217;s &#8220;realism&#8221; could be contrasted to the
&#8220;naturalism&#8221; of Van Dyke or numerous hack portraitists. But it is
very difficult to see how it can cope with post-1900 art, with its
divergent phenomena such as geometric and expressionist abstraction,
dadaism, Marcel Duchamp and the &#8220;ready-made&#8221; tradition, pop art,
conceptual art, installation art, performance art, etc. And it cannot
be used to understand the difference between &#8220;traditional&#8221; art
and &#8220;modern&#8221; art which is what I am concerned with here.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f3" name="n3">3.</a> John Berger supplied the historical
materialist explanation for this, linking it to the rise of
capitalism and its fixation on property and commodities. See Berger, 1972a.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f5" name="n5">5.</a> Warncke, 1997, p165. There is a
significant difference between this and the outrage that greeted
Manet and the impressionists in that the latter came from the public
and the press, whereas this came from the artists in Picasso&#8217;s
immediate circle and resulted in the public not seeing the painting
for nearly ten years.</p>

Neil Davidson has suggested that the position of the younger
Greenberg in his essay <em>Avant-Garde and Kitsch</em> is in some ways
superior to the position cited here. I think that this is true, but
space does not permit an account of the development of his views.
Justice for Greenberg will have to wait.</p>
