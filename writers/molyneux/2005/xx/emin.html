<p class="fst">Tracey Emin is the most famous contemporary artist in Britain.
This is the first time a woman has occupied this position and that
is, in itself, worthy of note. Moreover her fame is connected to what
makes her a serious and important artist.</p>

<p>Media treat her as a celebrity because they have picked up on the
fact that she is independently popular, she has a &#8216;fan base&#8217;. Who
are these &#8216;fans&#8217;? Mainly, though not exclusively, they are
younger women. They are part of the new expanded audience for modern
art, but they are not art world insiders. They relate to Emin because
Emin&#8217;s work relates to their experiences in a way that no other
artist&#8217;s does.</p>

<p>Most of her work is autobiographical. Its main subject matter is
her traumas and triumphs growing up in Margate, and becoming the
person she is today. It is often criticised for being &#8216;self-centred&#8217;.
This criticism completely misses the point so eagerly seized on by
her &#8216;fans&#8217;. The experiences re-presented in Emin&#8217;s art are not
just personal experiences, but are common to a wide layer of young
women growing up in this time, in this society. Normally these
experiences remain private, confided perhaps to &#8216;best friends&#8217;
but otherwise hidden from public view and therefore shameful. By
making these experiences into art, Emin actually engages in a process
of &#8216;democratic sharing&#8217; with her audience. The work is not
didactic and does not preach. It does not seek to impose a specific
response. It simply says, &#8216;This is what happened to me; this is how
I felt about it,&#8217; and perhaps, &#8216;This is how I dealt with it.&#8217;
If it strikes a chord, as it evidently often does, then so be it.</p>

<p>Emin&#8217;s first work to make a public impact, her tent, or <em>Everyone
I Ever Slept With, 1963&#8211;95</em>, was a good example of this. The
tent sat on the gallery floor. On the inside Emin had sewn the names
of her bedmates of the previous 30 years. To see or experience the
work the viewer has to crawl into the tent. Thus Emin has created a
&#8216;private&#8217; space, a den with private information about her life
which the public is invited to share. The fact, which she stresses,
that the names included not just lovers but also others she had
shared &#8216;the intimacy of sleep&#8217; with (such as her twin brothers
and aborted foetuses) is important. It does not negate the sexual
interpretation of the title, but it modifies it, ensuring that the
sexual is not separated from the emotional. What we are offered to
share is not gossip or titillation but feelings, including painful feelings.</p>

<p>Emin&#8217;s most famous work, <em>My Bed</em>, is a complex piece,
which has appeared in different forms, but essentially it works on
the same principle. According to the stereotype, women are the
homemakers and responsible for housework. A messed-up house shames a
woman, makes her a &#8216;slut&#8217;, much more than it does a man. The
bedroom and above all the bed itself represent a place of privacy,
intimacy and sex, pain and illness. The stained sheets are a visible
trace of all this and thus taboo: &#8216;You don&#8217;t wash your dirty
linen in public.&#8217; <em>My Bed</em> takes all this as its starting
point and confronts it, knowing that for some of us all the time and
many of us some of the time it is a lie. It is a spectacular coming
out. And out there thousands, perhaps millions, of people say, openly
or privately, &#8216;Yes! I&#8217;ve been there, I know what that&#8217;s about!&#8217;
That is why <em>My Bed</em> is one of those few works of contemporary
art that captures people&#8217;s imagination and stays in the public memory.</p>

<p>Much of the media coverage of <em>My Bed</em> seemed to assume that
she had simply transplanted her actual bed or bedroom into the Tate.
This, as a moment&#8217;s thought would have made clear, was nonsense. <em>My
Bed</em>, which had already appeared in Tokyo, was a consciously
constructed work, as much a made work of art as Van Gogh&#8217;s painting
of his bedroom. In so far as it was a sufficiently convincing
representation of a disordered bedroom to persuade journalists that
it was the real thing, this is testimony to Emin&#8217;s skill. <em>My Bed</em>
is also visually powerful in its own right.</p>

<p>Emin is a skilled practitioner in a range of media. Her drawing is
superb. She is able, with great economy, to achieve very accurate and
telling representations. Her line combines strength and
vulnerability, confidence and pain in exactly the right proportions,
and matching visual form to intellectual/ emotional content is
precisely the key skill of the visual artist.</p>
<p>Three of the themes in Emin&#8217;s work &#8211; class, sex and art &#8211;
are more or less omnipresent and make for its distinctiveness and power.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Class:</em> The most immediately striking and unusual thing
about both Emin&#8217;s persona and her work is the way in which she
positions herself as a working class artist.</p>

<p>Clearly Emin is not currently working class.</p>

<p>She is probably a millionaire and she functions, as all successful
visual artists do, as boss of her own small business. Her class
background was complex. Until Emin was seven her mother had a hotel
in Margate, but bankruptcy and poverty ensued when she broke up with
Emin&#8217;s father, and Emin&#8217;s youth, whether or not strictly
proletarian, was plebeian. Nor is she an artist who sees or presents
herself as associated with or representative of the working class movement.</p>

<p>What she does do is present herself as culturally working class.
This is evident in the way in which she conducts herself: in her
accent, of course, but more importantly in what she says and how she
says it. She makes no attempt to engage in &#8216;intellectual art speak&#8217;
but sticks to unaffected everyday language. This is highly unusual in
the art world, the ethos of which is very upper class. The language
used in her many appliqu&#233;d blankets, films and monoprint drawings is
the language of the street, including the swear words, the
grammatical errors and the misspellings. But, above all, the
experiences her art deals with are, by and large, the experiences of
working class girls.</p>

<p>The short film <em>Why I Never Became A Dancer</em> is one of her
most important and powerful works. It tells of Emin&#8217;s aspiration to
be a dancer and her participation in a dance competition in Margate,
the prize for which meant going to London. Just as she feels things
are going well she finds herself surrounded by a circle of local lads
(many of whom she has had sex with). At first she thinks they are
clapping her, and then she realises that in fact they are chanting in
unison &#8216;Slag, Slag, Slag&#8217;, and she runs from the ballroom in
dismay. The film ends with her dancing, alone and just for herself,
and saying to the camera, &#8216;Shane, Eddie, Tony, Doug, Richard ...
this one&#8217;s for you.&#8217; Of her recent film on teenage suicide, <em>Top
Spot</em>, Amy Lane wrote in <strong>Socialist Review</strong>, &#8216;There is
nothing that does not reflect the reality of Britain&#8217;s working
class estates. It is a painfully accurate portrayal of modern
adolescent experience&#8217;. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p>There is an element of class prejudice as well as misogyny in the
media and critical hostility to Emin. Middle class critics often miss
the point of her work because the kind of experiences she deals with
are not part of the world they inhabit.</p>

<p>Emin&#8217;s consciousness of this relationship with her audience was
evident in her fury at <em>Top Spot</em> being given an 18 certificate
by the censors, preventing it from reaching the very people it was
intended for.</p>

<p>It is often said that Emin is not political. If this were true I
would not find it a problem for, as Trotsky insisted, art cannot
simply be judged on its politics. As it happens it is not true. Emin
does not see herself as an artistic representative of a working class
political movement but she does have a political consciousness and
outlook, and this is clear from many of her public statements and
appearances. She is anti-racist, anti-homophobic, and anti-war. A
colleague, who knows the London art scene, says that in that world
Emin is known as &#8216;a committed socialist&#8217;.</p>

<p>I set this down for the record, but I do not believe that either
her leftish views or her affluent lifestyle constitute major grounds
for the evaluation of her art.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Sex:</em> That sex should be a major theme in Emin&#8217;s work is
hardly surprising. Sex has been a central theme in European art from
the Renaissance to Picasso and beyond (not to speak of Ancient Greece
and Rome, Japan and so on). But it should be said at the outset,
there is no element of eroticism or titillation here, unlike in
Botticelli, Renoir or Klimt. Nor is it sexual fantasy or dreams, as
we might find in surrealism, or the sex of the brothel featured so
heavily in late 19th century French art. It is real, everyday sex &#8211;
as experienced by her, of course, but also by millions of other
people. This, in itself, is remarkable. I do not think there is a
precedent for it in the whole of European visual art.</p>

<p>The history of art develops dialectically with each new
generation, movement or individual artist usually defining themselves
in opposition to the immediately preceding dominant trend. Part of
this process is the discovery of new material, both physically and in
terms of subject matter, to make art out of, which was often
previously thought of as &#8216;unartistic&#8217; (or vulgar, ugly, etc.).
This is one of the reasons why new art so often meets with the
reaction that it is &#8216;not art&#8217;. Thus, mid 19th century French art
painted &#8216;the heroism of modern life&#8217; as opposed to the heroes of
classical mythology; and the Futurists and Constructivists
aestheticised the machine and technology, previously anathema to
classicists and romantics alike. Picasso spoke of the difficulty of
finding a new subject and cited Van Gogh&#8217;s <em>Boots</em> as an
example. Tracey Emin has found a new subject.</p>

<p>A key feature of Emin&#8217;s treatment of sex is her disclosure of an
early teenage phase of promiscuity in Margate. In the voiceover on
<em>Why I Never Became a Dancer</em> she describes it as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;And then there was sex. It was something you could
just do, and it was for free. Sex was something simple. It didn&#8217;t
matter that I was young, 13 or 14. It didn&#8217;t matter that they were
men ... 19, 20, 25, 26. It never crossed my mind to ask them what the
attraction was. I knew ... sex was what it was ...&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">I suspect that even if it is not a majority experience, such a
phase among working class girls is quite common, driven by a complex
mixture of low self-esteem, the search for love, intimacy, pleasure,
excitement, desire to grow up, ambivalent yearnings for a baby, and
so on. Usually the experience remains hidden, for obvious reasons,
from parents, or school and the authorities. It therefore remains
largely unrecorded and unrepresented. Films and novels have
occasionally visited the territory, but not, until now, the elevated
world of fine art.</p>

<p>Emin&#8217;s treatment of this experience appears simple &#8211; a plain
rendering of the facts &#8211; but it is in fact quite complex and
nuanced. In <em>Dancer</em> she defends herself against the charge of
being a &#8216;slag&#8217; and records her conviction at the time that she
was &#8216;better than all those boys&#8217;. But in <em>Masculinity</em> she
writes that she &#8216;developed the ridiculous habit of sleeping with
men much older than me&#8217;. She also claims that her promiscuous phase
was very &#8216;educational&#8217; in an interview for <em>The South Bank
Show</em>. This &#8216;ambivalence&#8217; towards her sexual experiences runs
throughout her work.</p>

<p>Emin records many bad sexual experiences in her art but she does
not &#8216;aestheticise&#8217; them. She deals with childhood abuse,
humiliation, abandonment, rape and abortion in the way these things
actually happen to women (never as her own or others&#8217; fantasy
material) and with the severe emotional trauma and pain they caused.
There is no romanticisation of abjection.</p>

<p>This central theme is held in tension with two others. The first
is that her experiences, though often bad, have not proved
insuperable. Yes, they were deeply painful but they were not,
including the rape, &#8216;unspeakable&#8217; or &#8216;the worst thing
imaginable&#8217;. She does not revel in her suffering, only in her
ability to have overcome it. <em>Why I Never Became A Dancer</em> ends
with a seagull soaring up and away from the shores of Margate.</p>

<p>The second is the retention, despite the traumas of the past, of
an open, affirmative attitude to sex and sexuality:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;You don&#8217;t fuck me over/You gently lift me out of
bed/Lay me on the floor/And make love to me&#8217; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Holding these three elements, each of them a humane and
progressive response, in tension with each other but without allowing
any of them to be compromised, is a very considerable artistic and
emotional achievement.</p>

<p>Emin does not present herself as a feminist artist and is not
generally thought of as one. But, in dealing with sex Emin deals also
with sexism. <em>Why I Never Became A Dancer</em> confronts the &#8211;
very crude &#8211; sexism rampant among certain teenage boys and young
men. <em>My Bed</em> challenges the sexist attitude that makes a
disordered bedroom much more shameful for a woman than a man. Indeed
there is a sense in which the totality of her art practice and
persona challenge the double standards about sex.</p>

<p>The question of class interacts with the question of sexism here.
Emin is not seen as a &#8216;feminist&#8217; artist because feminism and,
especially, feminism in the art world has been a largely middle class
phenomenon, focusing mainly on the issues that concern middle class
and professional women: especially how women are represented in the
media, literature, art, etc. The issues Emin deals with &#8211; how
teenage girls get &#8216;slagged off&#8217; and &#8216;broken into&#8217; &#8211; are not
recognised as feminist because they come from a different world. But
the fact is that Emin tackles sexism at the sharp end.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Art: I Need Art Like I Need God</em> is the title and
content of one of Emin&#8217;s pieces in neon lighting, and &#8216;art&#8217;, in
particular Emin&#8217;s relationship to art, is a central theme in her work.</p>

<p>One of the ways &#8216;art&#8217; features in Emin&#8217;s work is through her
references to other artists. Of course many artists do this, but
Emin&#8217;s range of reference is broad and impressive (which gives the
lie to another of the myths about her, namely that she is some kind
of &#8216;primitive&#8217; or &#8216;naif&#8217;).</p>

<p>Most obviously she is indebted to her hero Edvard Munch, and to
Egon Schiele. The use of language in both the monoprints and the
blankets nods to Basquiat; the neon lighting pieces are influenced by
Don Flavin and Bruce Naumann; <em>My Bed</em> recalls Rauschenberg&#8217;s
<em>Bed</em> and, more subtly, the bed of Manet&#8217;s <em>Olympia</em>; <em>The
Helter Skelter</em> construction references the Tatlin tower; the
blanket work in general builds on the use of sewing and textiles by
feminist artists of the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

<p>Of course if quoting other artists was the main point of these
works it would make them banal, but with Emin&#8217;s pieces this is not
the case. Her principal tribute to Munch is <em>Homage to Edvard Munch
and All my Dead Children</em> and is accompanied by her verbal scream
which is truly disturbing and terrible. Her drawings may owe
something to Schiele but are in no way imitations or similar in
content. In the case of the blanket work Emin has transformed the
genre, freeing it of its craft and genteel associations, and making
it into vibrant new form in its own right.</p>

<p>As we know from Marx, in class societies the ruling class
invariably (if not completely) dominates the culture. However the
domination in the field of visual art has been more complete, more
extreme than in other art forms. This is because whereas the poet or
novelist needs only pen and paper, visual art must be embodied in
materials (which are very expensive), stored, and exhibited, either
in museums and galleries or in public places (which of course are
never controlled by the public). And because in the capitalist epoch
the art market has focused on the buying and selling of &#8216;unique&#8217;
and &#8216;original&#8217; works, in contrast to music and literature, which
centre on either the large-scale selling of mechanical reproductions
&#8211; books, CDs, etc. &#8211; or live performances to collective audiences.</p>

<p>As a result, from Tutankhamun to Lorenzo de Medici and Henry VIII
to Rockefeller and Saatchi, visual art has been dominated by the very
rich and very powerful. This in turn has meant that the exclusion and
marginalisation of working class people, women and black people has
been even more marked in visual art than in other art forms. There is
no female painter whose standing compares with Jane Austen or George
Eliot and not a single painting by a black artist in the National
Gallery. In this context the work of Tracey Emin is both an example
of limited change that has occurred and a challenge to the present
and the future. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p>Marx also tells us that art, like religion, philosophy and
politics, is part of the superstructure of society, which arises from
and is conditioned by the economic base. I would add that the
economic base, that is, the forces and relations of production, gives
rise to and shapes a developing ensemble of social relations which
range from how people dress, to family and sexual relations, to how
people look at a king or a beggar and how a king or a beggar looks at
the people, to how we experience the sea, the countryside and the city.</p>

<p>What major art does is express and comment upon these changing
social relations in a visually powerful way. Giotto and Brueghel,
Hals and Rembrandt, Hogarth and Goya, Courbet, Picasso and Warhol all
do this in their differing ways. And so does Emin.</p>

<p>The changing social relations that Emin addresses are those
shaping the relative positions in society of women and men,
especially young working class women and men. The changes in this
sphere in the course the last half century or so have been
spectacular: the huge rise in the number of women (especially married
women) in paid labour, the Equal Pay Act, the Sex Discrimination Act,
the pill, legalised abortion, freer divorce and lip service to
equality all over the place.</p>

<p>In other ways they remain strictly limited: no fundamental change
in the division of labour in the home, no equal pay in reality, women
still hugely underrepresented in top jobs, sexist images all over the
media. Of course the change is not evenly spread across society. In
my judgement the least has been at the very top among those who own
the wealth and control the state. There, bourgeois male power remains
firmly entrenched. The biggest change has been among the professional
middle classes &#8211; academics, intellectuals, media people, etc. &#8211;
where the success of girls in education and higher education has had
its effect and equal opportunities policies abound.</p>

<p>Many working class women have also benefited from the changes,
from the shift in general attitudes and the increased educational and
job opportunities. But for the majority, especially in the manual as
opposed to white collar working class, where money for child care is
scarce or non-existent and the struggle for survival dominates, the
change has been minimal. Some working class men, in the main the
politically more progressive, have changed their attitudes, but many
have not and the old sexism remains rampant. The problems are
particularly acute among teenagers and young men anxious to establish
their virility, and this is what working class girls and young women
have to cope with.</p>

<p>These are the contradictions which Emin has lived and which her
art expresses and responds to with clarity and passion. Politically
there is an obvious problem in that while Emin&#8217;s work ultimately
carries a message of hope, it is hope for an individual not a
collective or social solution, and this can only be possible for a
small minority. Unfortunately we don&#8217;t get our art to political
order and given the historical period of Emin&#8217;s artistic formation,
the 1980s and early 1990s, it is hardly surprising that collective
working class emancipation through political action was not high on
her agenda. What matters more than the correct politics is whether
the problems addressed are real, whether the art has integrity and
whether it is visually imaginative and powerful. Emin&#8217;s work
succeeds on all these counts with the extra factor that it really
speaks to people, and people beyond the normal range of &#8216;art
lovers&#8217;, in a way that is achieved by no other contemporary artist.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p class="note">Thanks are due to my students with whom many of these ideas about
Emin have been discussed, in particular to Lucy Sanders, Roxanne
Chappell, Jessica Masterman, Danielle Wright and Kim Heal for their
stimulating presentation on <em>My Bed</em>.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> <strong>Socialist Review</strong>, December 2004, p.&nbsp;34. This short
piece by Amy Lane is the best published article on Emin I have read anywhere.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f2" name="n2">2.</a> Words appliqu&#233;d to <em>Garden of Horror M</em> (1998).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f3" name="n3">3.</a> It perhaps needs emphasising that while capitalism remains, the
ruling class&#8217;s cultural hegemony in general, and its domination of
the art world in particular, can be challenged and partially eroded &#8211;
but not abolished.</p>
