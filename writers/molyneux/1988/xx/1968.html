<p class="fst">Wordsworth was writing about the French Revolution but his words
express splendidly how a generation of revolutionaries felt about
1968. So powerful were the emotions engendered by the events of that
year that even when the passage of twenty years has, in all too many
cases, cooled them into mere nostalgia for a past that has long since
been renounced or &lsquo;outgrown&rsquo;, there is still sufficient
interest for the anniversary to attract quite large-scale media
attention.</p>

<p>As I begin this article in the first week of 1988 the <strong>New
Statesman</strong> has already produced a special 1968 supplement, <em>World
in Action</em> has done a &lsquo;Where are they now?&rsquo;
documentary featuring three activists of the period, and I have
before me four substantial books on the subject which it is the task
of this article to review. By the time this review appears it is very
possible that revolutionaries of post-sixty-eight vintage will be
thoroughly fed up with the reminiscences of their elders.</p>

<p>Nevertheless is it important that revolutionaries, young and old
alike, should seriously study the struggles and movements of 1968. To
change the world it is necessary to understand it and the present can
only be understood as a product of the past. Many important features
of today&rsquo;s world were directly shaped by the events of twenty
years ago, e.g. neither Irangate nor the US intervention in the Gulf
can be understood except in the context of Vietnam, and the war that
grinds remorselessly on in Ireland had its opening skirmish in Derry
on 5 October 1968.</p>

<p>For the revolutionary left 1968 was particularly decisive,
undermining the well-nigh absolute hegemony of the old reformist and
Stalinist organisations and opening a space in which the project of
revolutionary party building became a realistic possibility. Even
more than a decade of downturn has not sufficed to close that space
completely.</p>

<p>Here it is necessary to insist, in spite of and <em>because</em> of
the likely media hype, that 1968 is not a myth or a romantic
fairy-tale conjured up by ageing hippies harking back to the good old
days of their lost youth. On the contrary it was a year of real mass
challenge to the international capitalist order on a scale that had
not been seen since the end of the Second World War and possibly
since the great revolutionary wave of 1917-23. Even the briefest
chronology of the year&rsquo;s major confrontations makes this clear:</p>

<p class="fst">If anything the memoirs of old or ex-student revolutionaries are
likely to underestimate rather than overestimate the significance of
the year for the simple reason that they were almost certainly
marginal to the really big struggles. Unfortunately the media
discussion of 1968 is unlikely to correct such imbalances, still less
form a basis for serious study, and sadly the same applies to two of
our four books.</p>

<p>First there is David Caute&rsquo;s <strong>Sixty-Eight: The Year of the
Barricades</strong>. This is both the worst and the most right-wing of the
bunch in that it is the only one not explicitly on the side of the
movements it describes. Caute studiously avoids any clear statement
of his political position, in the name of historical &lsquo;objectivity&rsquo;
perhaps, and strikes a pose of standing atop the barricades of his
title looking down condescendingly on both sides. I suppose one could
call this &lsquo;liberalism&rsquo;, but it is a liberalism which, as
so often, lends infinitely more aid and comfort to reaction than it
does to those in revolt. Perhaps the people Caute really identifies
with are</p>

<p class="quoteb">The majority of university teachers [who], while often
initially sympathetic to student demands, finally rejected the whole
movement, equated &lsquo;student power&rsquo; with anti-rational
left-fascism &ndash;; and welcomed its repression.</p>

<p class="fst">Perhaps Caute would dismiss this as a slander, and at a safe
distance of twenty years he has no need to welcome the repression,
but how else to explain his penchant for quoting distressed and
outraged academics such as Diana Trilling and Sir Douglas Logan and
the evident relish with which he combs the movements for every folly,
absurdity and scandal he can lay his hands on.</p>

<p>Anyone who has experienced or even thought seriously about
revolution knows that mass spontaneous struggles of the oppressed
(without which revolution is impossible) inevitably include certain
blunders, excesses and even crimes. However it has always been the
mark of reaction to focus on these scandals as if they represented
the essence of the movement, and of the treacherous liberal
&lsquo;sympathiser&rsquo; to use them as an excuse for retiring to
the sidelines. This is precisely what Caute does.</p>

<p>His approach is a mixture of the academic and the journalistic,
with a heavy bias towards the latter and the vices of both. The quest
for understanding is continually sacrificed to the quest for good
copy. It is this which determines his heavy over-emphasis on events
in America (seven whole chapters, two on the Chicago Convention
alone), for it is the American student movement with its isolation
from the ranks of the organised working class that supplies the
richest harvest of &lsquo;crazies&rsquo;. By contrast Ireland, with
not a Yippie in sight, does not rate a mention &ndash; not even in
the chronology.</p>

<p>Similar motivations seem to lie behind Caute&rsquo;s concern with
the sixties counter-culture. Cultural developments inevitably reflect
and respond to what is happening in the wider society but the
relationship is not mechanical. There was indeed a close and
important connection between the left, the student revolt and the
sixties cultural explosion that included everything from the Beat
poets to the Beatles and Jean Luc Godard to Richard Neville, but they
were not the same thing. Rather they were movements whose paths
crossed in a significant conjuncture but whose directions (and
composition) were different. Caute however is interested in amalgams
not distinctions, in sensational montage not analysis. As a
consequence he both falsely conflates the counter-culture and the
left and fails to see the merit that existed in many of the artistic
and intellectual products of the period. It is the persona not the
poetry of Allen Ginsburg that interests him, the image of Timothy
Leary not the ideas of R.D. Laing.</p>

<p>The intellectual poverty of the book is, perhaps, best illustrated
by the questions Caute poses in the introduction.</p>

<p class="quoteb">What were they [the rebelling students]: courageous
visionaries or romantic Utopians? Genuine revolutionaries or
posturing spoilt brats? An authentic resistance movement or a
frivolous carnival by kids who had never known poverty and the fear
of unemployment? An idealist challenge to imperialism or a pantomime
of rhetorical gestures? A rebirth of the critical intelligence or a
long, drugged &lsquo;trip&rsquo; into fashionable incoherence? This
book aims to provide a history which will yield tentative answers to
these questions. (<strong>Sixty-Eight</strong>, p.&nbsp;vii)</p>

<p class="fst">With a problematic like that, drawn straight from the world of the
Sunday colour supplements, it is hardly surprising that Caute&rsquo;s
book is so weak. Its merit is that its four hundred-odd pages
contain, amidst the retrospective smirking and cynicism, a good deal
of factual information. In terms of theory and analysis it is
worthless.</p>

<p>Tariq All&rsquo;s <strong>Street Fighting Years</strong> is distinctly
preferable in its politics and tone &ndash; Tariq, at least, is clear
which side he is on &ndash; but hardly better as a historical account
or as a guide to understanding. Indeed, this is really the most
disappointing of the books because we might have expected something
much better.</p>

<p>Tariq&rsquo;s approach is autobiographical and this in itself is
the root of some of the problems. I do not mean by this that
socialists should reject autobiography in principle or that works in
this genre can never be major contributions &ndash; think of
Trotsky&rsquo;s <strong>My Life</strong> or Serge&rsquo;s <strong>Memoirs of a
Revolutionary</strong> &ndash; but Tariq is not Trotsky or Serge, not by a
long chalk. Quite apart from questions of theoretical acumen and
literary talent, the great strength of <strong>My Life</strong>, for example,
is that Trotsky was central to the events he describes and those
events were central to the epoch. Tariq, however, was central only to
the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign in Britain which was a very minor
episode among the epic battles of 1968, and as a consequence the
autobiographical form repeatedly distorts any overall picture of the
period.</p>

<p>Moreover, Tariq was not in any sense a typical sixty-eighter.
Nineteen sixty-eight was above all an eruption of new forces from
below whose aspirations were democratic and egalitarian in the
extreme. Naturally these new forces threw up new leaders (though
often the leaders were foisted on the movements by the media) but
usually these leaders at least came from the rank and file, even if
their rise was meteoric. But Tariq never seems to have been part of
the rank and file. His class background, his education and status
(President of the Oxford Union in the early sixties, reviews editor
for Michael Heseltine&rsquo;s <strong>Town</strong> magazine) made him always
of the elite, always a star, and for this reason there are crucial
aspects of the sixty-eight experience he is unable to grasp or
communicate.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know or show what it was like to organise at
grass roots level even among students (the working class seems to
cross his path only accidentally) and he has almost no involvement in
direct collective struggle. Leading a solidarity campaign, even when
a couple of its demonstrations end in punch-ups, is not quite the
same as being in a fight, as part of a collective, against an
immediate enemy, whether it is a university authority, a boss, or the
state. Consequently he misses the key &lsquo;feeling&rsquo; of the
time, namely the extraordinary elation of hitherto anonymous
powerless individuals discovering their collective power.</p>

<p>Many of the participants in the struggles of sixty-eight became
completely intoxicated by this experience and, lacking any knowledge
of the sober realities of class struggle, failed to see any
limitations to it &ndash; a fact which gave rise to much
ultra-leftism and some of the absurdities seized on by Caute.
Nonetheless it was one of the central driving forces of the
international movement. Tariq doesn&rsquo;t really express it. This
is not because he was a premature hardened Bolshevik, it&rsquo;s
because he was never anonymous and powerless. For this reason it is
quite false to claim, as the book&rsquo;s jacket does, that this is
&lsquo;an autobiography of an entire generation&rsquo;, if by that is
meant a generation of revolutionaries.</p>

<p>Tariq&rsquo;s best quality is that he is always on the right side,
opposing bad things, supporting good things: anti-imperialist,
anti-capitalist, anti-Stalinist, anti-racist, anti-sexist,
anti-sectarian; pro-Vietnam, pro-Che, pro-Malcolm X, pro-student,
pro-socialist, pro-democracy and pro-the revolution. But this good
quality is offset by two bad qualities, both of which are amply
displayed in <strong>Street Fighting Years</strong>.</p>

<p>The first of these I can only describe as an alarming absence of a
basic sense of revolutionary decency. How else could he write,
without a blush, passages such as the following?</p>

<p class="quoteb">There were two small tables beautifully laid out for
supper and soon other guests arrived, somewhat less punctually than
myself Kenneth and Kathleen Tynan and Eleanor Bron were assigned the
same table as me, while sundry starlets and Ursula Andress, attired
in an amazingly low-cut outfit, were seated on the other table a few
feet away. Brando was the perfect host, dividing his attention
equally between us and his other guests ... Dinner was followed by
dancing and later Brando kindly offered to put me up for the night,
but the Tynans, who had left early, had insisted I spend the rest of
the night at their flat in Mayfair. This seemed a more relaxed
option.</p>

<p class="quote">Over brunch the next day ... (<strong>Street Fighting Years</strong>,
p.&nbsp;75)</p>

<p class="fst">This may have been the spirit of &lsquo;swinging London&rsquo; in
the sixties, it was not the spirit of sixty-eight.</p>

<p>Tariq&rsquo;s other bad quality, less offensive but ultimately
more damaging, is the superficiality of his politics. It&rsquo;s not
that his political judgement is especially poor, in fact much of the
time it is eminently sensible compared to that of many people around
at the time, but it is always impressionistic, based on surface
appearances, never the product of serious Marxist analysis.</p>

<p>For example he writes quite a lot about the in-fighting on the far
left and the &lsquo;style&rsquo; of the respective groups (Militant
were &lsquo;Seventh Day Adventists&rsquo;, the Socialist Labour
League, forerunner of the WRP, were &lsquo;run like a one-party
statelet&rsquo;) but the political differences are simply not
discussed seriously. Consider this account of the International
Socialists (IS):</p>

<p class="quoteb">The IS members were entirely different and, on most
questions, were refreshingly undogmatic, but their view of world
politics seemed to be bizarre and far too Eurocentric. When I first
heard them talk among themselves they gave me the impression of being
a weird breed of professional anti-communists. When I discovered that
for them there was no qualitative difference between Chiang Kai-shek
and Batista on the one hand and Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro on the
other, I realised that I would always be a stranger in their house.
(<strong>Street Fighting Years</strong>, p.&nbsp;119)</p>

<p class="fst">Tariq must know that this is a travesty: that the real issue was
not Eurocentrism but the centrality of the working class and that the
argument was not about whether to support Castro against Batista or
Mao against Chiang but whether the societies over which Mao and
Castro presided were, in the absence of workers&rsquo; revolution and
workers&rsquo; power, some variety of socialism or workers&rsquo;
state or whether they were state capitalist. Tariq knows this but
prefers not to get involved in such &lsquo;theoretical&rsquo;
controversy &ndash; much better to skate over the matter with
superior phrases about &lsquo;bizarre&rsquo; views and &lsquo;weird
breeds&rsquo;.</p>

<p>But is the debate about Stalinism and the nature of third world
national liberation movements irrelevant to the subject matter of
Tariq&rsquo;s book? On the contrary it is of burning relevance. For
the central theme of his account and, in his view, the central theme
of the events of the late sixties, is the struggle against the
Vietnam War and in support of the Vietnamese Revolution. His own
visit to North Vietnam in early 1967, when he saw at first hand the
hideous atrocities perpetrated by the American bombing, is described
as</p>

<p class="quoteb">a formative experience; something I can never forget ...
What I had seen was the most epic resistance ever witnessed in the
sordid annals of imperialism. (<strong>Street Fighting Years</strong>, p.&nbsp;113)</p>

<p class="fst">Yet now, twenty years later, thirteen years after the fall of
Saigon, we are offered no critical reflections on this experience.
Despite the fact that the outcome of events in Indo-China (above all
the monstrous Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea, but also the Chinese
invasion of Vietnam, the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea and the sad
spectacle of the boat people) posed questions about the underlying
nature of these revolutions in the sharpest possible form; despite
the fact that his own organisation, the Fourth International, debated
the matter furiously, with Ernest Mandel (to whom <strong>Street Fighting
Years</strong> is dedicated) insisting that the Pol Pot regime must be
designated a workers&rsquo; state in order not to open the door to
the theory of state capitalism; despite the fact that disillusionment
with Vietnam and China wrought havoc on the left internationally;
despite all this, Tariq maintains a discreet silence on the question.
Instead all we get is silly comments like the following:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Many years later I was talking to a veteran communist
leader in India. He was describing a meeting with Ho Chi Minh in
1964, two years before my visit. The Indian asked Ho Chi Minh to
explain how the Indochinese Communist Party, which had been formed at
roughly the same time as the Communist Party in India, had succeeded
whilst they in India had failed. The Vietnamese had laughed and
replied: &lsquo;In India you had Gandhi. Here I am Gandhi!&rsquo; The
remark was more serious than one might imagine. (<strong>Street Fighting
Years</strong>, p.&nbsp;113)</p>

<p class="fst">The irony is that in so far as the remark is at all serious (in
suggesting that both Gandhi and Ho represented varieties of bourgeois
nationalism) it is in a way that quite escapes our author.</p>

<p>In one respect, however, <strong>Street Fighting Years</strong> does give an
insight into the theoretical basis of Tariq&rsquo;s views. It reveals
the decisive influence on his thinking, not of Marx or Trotsky, but
of Isaac Deutscher. Deutscher, exponent of a literary Trotskyism
shorn of its revolutionary cutting edge, propounded the view that the
Soviet bureaucracy would reform itself from above, and it is
Deutscherism that informs Tariq&rsquo;s latest enthusiasm, Mikhail
Gorbachev. A &lsquo;powerful spectre ... beginning to haunt the
European powers&rsquo; according to Tariq,</p>

<p class="quoteb">Gorbachev was foreseen by Deutscher. One hopes that the
Soviet leader will soon repay the compliment by publishing
Deutscher&rsquo;s monumental histories of the USSR. (<strong>Street
Fighting Years</strong>, p.&nbsp;269)</p>

<p class="fst">What a pathetic re-enactment of the illusion, so characteristic of
Tariq and many of his comrades in the late sixties and early
seventies, that if the Trotskyists loved-up to Castro, Ho Chi Minh
and others with sufficient fervour they would &lsquo;repay the
compliment&rsquo; by recognising Trotsky. The only difference is that
no one is going to storm the US embassy chanting &lsquo;Gorby! Gorby!
Gorby!&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the end, however, it is the omissions as much as the howlers
that make this book such a let-down. It doesn&rsquo;t capture the
spirit of the period, it doesn&rsquo;t offer a Marxist analysis, and
it doesn&rsquo;t even tell you much about street fighting, of which
Tariq, as far as I know, did little.</p>

<p>Ronald Fraser&rsquo;s <strong>1968: A Student Generation in Revolt</strong>,
provides a very refreshing contrast. Fraser is a talented and
conscientious oral historian who will be known to many readers of
<strong>International Socialism</strong> for his outstanding <strong>Blood of Spain</strong>.
Here, with a team of assistants, he has attempted the ambitious
project of recreating the struggles of sixty-eight through the
memories of 230 student activists of the time drawn from six
different countries. Moreover the attempt succeeds, at times
brilliantly. Fraser really has captured the &lsquo;feeling&rsquo; of
the student revolt in those heady days.</p>

<p>This is important for two reasons. First because, while it is
pretty generally acknowledged that there was a special sixty-eight
atmosphere, there are (as Caute&rsquo;s and Ali&rsquo;s books
testify) rival interpretations as to what exactly that atmosphere
was. The revolutionary liberatory experience born of collective
defiance and initiative needs defending against those who depict the
whole thing as some frenzied psychedelic trip, or the epitome of
radical chic, or merely the exaggerated folly of naive youth.
Secondly because as much as possible of this experience needs to be
communicated to the current generation of socialists and
revolutionaries &ndash; the children of the downturn &ndash; who,
through objective circumstances, have never known the exhilaration of
such a movement but who, if they are to remain revolutionaries, have
to believe, emotionally as well as intellectually, that such things
can happen.</p>

<p>Fraser and his collaborators achieve this by allowing the
participants to speak for themselves, often without interpretation or
commentary (though not, of course, without the interpretation of
selection &ndash; a significant point as we shall see). The best way
of illustrating this is simply to quote from the book.</p>

<p class="quoteb">It&rsquo;s a moment I shall never forget. Suddenly,
spontaneously, barricades were being thrown up in the streets. People
were building up the cobble stones because they wanted &ndash; many
of them for the first time &ndash; to throw themselves into a
collective spontaneous activity. People were releasing all their
repressed feelings, expressing them in a festive spirit. Thousands
felt the need to communicate with each other, to love one another.
That night has forever made me optimistic about history. Having lived
through it, I can&rsquo;t ever say &lsquo;It will never happen&rsquo;
...<br />
Danny Cohn-Bendit, student leader at Nanterre, on the night of
the Paris barricades, 10/11 May 1968. (<strong>1968</strong>, p. 7)</p>

<p class="fst">The more straitlaced among us may cavil at this talk of &lsquo;love&rsquo;
and &lsquo;communication&rsquo;, but in an uprising people do have
such feelings just as much as rage or bitterness or hope. I visited
Paris shortly after the Night of the Barricades and there were no
street battles during my brief visit but I saw how people had been
changed &ndash; transformed is a better word &ndash; by their
experiences. I too will never forget it and can&rsquo;t ever say &lsquo;It
will never happen&rsquo;.</p>

<p class="quoteb">My most vivid memory of May &rsquo;68? The newfound
ability for everyone to <em>speak</em> &ndash; to speak of anything
with anyone. In that month of talking during May you learnt more than
in the whole of your five years of studying. It was really another
world &ndash; a dream world perhaps &ndash; but that&rsquo;s what
I&rsquo;ll always remember: the need and the right for everyone to
speak.<br />
Ren&eacute; Bourrigaud, student at the Ecole Superieure
d&rsquo;Agriculture, Angers, France. (<strong>1968</strong>, p.&nbsp;7)</p>

<p class="fst">Bourrigaud is describing what happened in a small conservative
town in western France when the municipal theatre was occupied!</p>

<p class="quoteb">It became a permanent forum of debate. Workers came and
took part&ndash;;it was the first time they had ever set foot in this
temple of bourgeois culture. Some of them spoke about their
experiences during the Popular Front occupations of 1936. (<strong>1968</strong>,
p. 194)</p>

<p class="fst">But it is a representative experience &ndash; in Paris it was the
Odeon, the national theatre, that became the forum, non-stop,
twenty-four hours a day. Indeed something like it happens in every
revolution &ndash; witness John Reed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">What a marvellous sight to see Putilovsky Zavod pour out
its four thousand to listen to Social Democrats, Socialist
Revolutionaries, Anarchists, anybody, whatever they had to say, as
long as they would talk! For months in Petrograd, and all over
Russia, every street-corner was a public tribune. In railway trains,
street-cars, always the spurting up of impromptu debate everywhere
... At every meeting, attempts to limit the time of speakers voted
down, and every man free to express the thought that was in him. (<strong>Ten
Days that Shook the World</strong>, p.&nbsp;40)</p>

<p class="fst">But for us in Thatcher&rsquo;s Britain May &rsquo;68 is the
closest to home, the proof of what is possible in advanced
&lsquo;democratic&rsquo; western Europe, and what is possible in
revolution is what seems impossible the rest of the time:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The savage night of battle that followed was heard all
over France. Radio reporters covered it live ... A well-known former
soccer commentator (!) was reporting the events for one station:</p>

<p class="quote">&lsquo;Now the CRS are charging, they&rsquo;re storming
the barricade &ndash; oh, my God! There&rsquo;s a battle raging. The
students are counter-attacking, you can hear the noise &ndash; the
CRS are retreating ... Now they&rsquo;re regrouping, getting ready to
charge again. The inhabitants are throwing things at the CRS &ndash;
oh! The police are retaliating, shooting grenades into the windows of
apartments ...&rsquo;At this point the radio station, which had been
telling the commentator over the air not to dramatise events,
interrupted him. &lsquo;This can&rsquo;t be true, the CRS don&rsquo;t
do things like that!&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m telling you what I&rsquo;m
seeing ...&rsquo; His voice went dead &ndash; they&rsquo;d cut him
off. (<strong>1968</strong>, pp.&nbsp;187&ndash;88)</p>

<p class="fst">One of the ways in which Fraser&rsquo;s book excels is in
depicting the process of political awakening and commitment as it
occurred in numerous individuals as part of the overall movement.
Each story is different, unique, but from Berkeley to Belfast there
is a common theme &ndash; the individual changing in the midst of
collective action:</p>

<p class="quoteb">My world had been very staid, very traditional, very
frightened, very middle class, and respectable. And here I was doing
these things that six months before I would have thought were just
horrible. But I was in the midst of an enormous tide of people ... It
was phenomenally liberating ... At the same time it was political
struggle. It wasn&rsquo;t just Columbia. There <em>was</em> a fucking
war on in Vietnam, and the civil rights movement ... 1968 just
cracked the universe open for me. And the fact of getting involved
meant that never again was I going to look at something outside with
the kind of reflex condemnation or fear. Yes it was the making of me
&ndash; or the unmaking.<br />
Mike Wallace, occupation of Columbia
University, New York, April 1968 (<strong>1968</strong>, p.&nbsp;8)</p>

<p class="quoteb">And when we decided to occupy it was like the revolution
had started! I was just a typical student, like most of those sitting
in. But we discovered what is meant by collective strength, we felt
our power. I can remember one of the IS student leaders saying: &lsquo;We
are sitting in because we have to protest against starvation in the
Third World. &rsquo; Clearly it had nothing to do with that &ndash;
and yet somehow clearly it did. We were taking on the world, the
political power structure and we sensed that rebellion from below
could change it.<br />
John Rose, LSE, 1967 (<strong>1968</strong>, p.&nbsp;112)</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;Immediately, another march to City Hall [Belfast]
was proposed. The law required that the police be given notice of all
marches and an individual&rsquo;s name be given as the responsible
organiser. No one stood up to accept the latter role.</p>

<p class="quote">&lsquo;And then, all of a sudden, I remember this
extraordinary voice with its amazing rhetorical ability come from one
of the rows ...&rsquo; recalled Anne Devlin, sixteen-year-old high
school student and daughter of a Catholic labour politician. &lsquo;The
voice went out to the roof and came back again: &ldquo;Mr Chairman, I
am an orphan, I have nothing to lose, I will give my name ...&rdquo;
It was Bernadette [Devlin]. Where she got the voice and the
confidence to do it, I don&rsquo;t know, but she grabbed her moment
in history and set herself on a course for ever after.&rsquo; (<strong>1968</strong>,
pp.&nbsp;207&ndash;8)</p>

<p class="quoteb">Well, one morning my young brother comes running home,
out of breath, with his little satchel, saying: &lsquo;Come quick,
there&rsquo;s a demonstration!&rsquo; So instead of going to school I
followed him and we found ourselves on the Boulevard Saint-Michel in
the middle of this huge demo. How can I describe it? A fabulous
happiness, a tremendous joy! I recognised a lot of friends from the
Vietnam committee, we kissed. And then I see myself, holding hands
with my brother, shouting, laughing, going through the streets with
the demo. It was May &rsquo;68!<br />
Lily Metreux (<strong>1968</strong>, p.&nbsp;179)</p>

<p class="fst">In revolutions people express outrage and anger at the brutality
of the system but outrage and anger are not the mainspring of
revolution; revolutions are egalitarian but revolution is not made
for equality; revolutions demand justice but, at bottom, revolution
is not about justice; revolution is about <em>freedom</em> &ndash; yes,
freedom of the individual &ndash; and individual freedom is
inseparable from collective power. This is not the conscious message
of Fraser&rsquo;s <strong>1968</strong>, but it is a message that vibrates from
a multitude of its pages and for that reason, in itself, it deserves
to be widely read.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it also has serious political weaknesses. Fraser,
like Caute and even, to some extent, Tariq, does not really lay his
political cards on the table, but it would appear that, like a number
of his interviewees, he has retreated from the explicit commitment to
revolution typical of sixty-eight to a vague radical reformism. He
would probably endorse the comment of Robert Linhart, former leader
of the Union des Jeunesses Communistes Marxistes-Leninistes, that
&lsquo;the illusion in our ranks, Trotskyists and Maoists alike, was
the seizure of power. Noone believes in that anymore&rsquo; (<strong>1968</strong>,
p.&nbsp;325). He also seems to agree with Frank Bardacke that the
American SDS&rsquo;s turn to revolution in 1968 was a mistake, and
with David Gilbert that it led people to look for &lsquo;almost
magical solutions&rsquo; including a &lsquo;regurgitation of the
Marxist formulation of the working class&rsquo; (<strong>1968</strong>,
p.&nbsp;261).</p>

<p>The result of this retreat is that the book ends very much with a
whimper &ndash; the familiar invocation of the movementist alliance:
more democracy, greater civil rights, more freedoms ... the demands
of women, ecologists, ethnic and cultural minorities and others.
(<strong>1968</strong>, p.&nbsp;332) It is to Fraser&rsquo;s credit as a
historian that this feeble concluding perspective has not greatly
obscured the incendiary material that precedes it, nonetheless it
does limit it and distort it in various ways. Symptomatic of this is
that Fraser restricts his account to students. This is a major fault.
Of course no one would deny that students were immensely important in
1968, but it is quite false to present the struggles of that year as
purely or even predominantly student.</p>

<p>The Vietnamese Tet Offensive was not launched by students; it was
not students who burned the ghettos across America when Martin Luther
King was assassinated; it was not the street fighting on the Left
Bank but the general strike of ten million workers that made the May
Events the high point of the whole movement; Czechoslovakia&rsquo;s
Prague Spring and the resistance to the Soviet invasion involved
students but was also far wider, and the same applied to the struggle
in Northern Ireland; in Italy there was a direct connection between
the student unrest and the revolt of the workers in the hot summer of
1969.</p>

<p>Failing to recognise this and focussing exclusively on students
means, for example, that Fraser devotes only part of one paragraph to
a description of only one of the ghetto uprisings, and that by a
black student at Columbia who was not directly involved. However more
is at stake here than just balance and comprehensiveness of coverage.
Fraser&rsquo;s student exclusivity is a concession to the view
(epitomised by Caute who produces the blatant fabrication that &lsquo;only
black America provided a revolt by those who were exploited as well
as alienated&rsquo; [<strong>Sixty-Eight</strong>, p.&nbsp;vii]) that
sixty-eight was primarily a revolt of the privileged. If sixty-eight
was a purely student affair then its significance as a challenge to
capitalist power is enormously diminished. The whole demon of
revolution is neatly exorcised for it is self- evident that students
by themselves cannot make the revolution.</p>

<p>Taking students as the starting point also makes it impossible to
produce a coherent explanation as to <em>why</em> this international
revolt took place. In so far as Fraser attempts to tackle this
question, it is via the biographical experiences of his informants,
but here the oral history method lets him down. Accounts of
individual experience, skilfully selected and juxtaposed as they are
here, can be very effective at describing <em>what</em> happened, but
cannot themselves explain <em>why</em> it happened. This is a task
which requires Marxist analysis but Fraser does not provide it.</p>

<p>A book which does is Chris Harman&rsquo;s <strong>The Fire Last Time:
1968 and After</strong>. The enormous superiority of this work over the
others reviewed here &ndash; and really it is in a different class &ndash;
derives first and foremost from the fact that Harman is alone in
approaching the subject armed with the Marxist method, i.e. a method
which makes its point of departure the development of the forces of
production and the effect of this development on the relations of
production and the class struggle and then goes on to consider the
impact of and response to these changes at the level of the
superstructure (politics, ideology, etc.).</p>

<p>Harman has produced a <em>tour de force</em>: much more than just an
account of 1968, it is an overall guide to the class struggle in
Europe and America from the late sixties through to the mid-seventies
set firmly against the background of the development of world
capitalism since the Second World War.</p>

<p>In seeking to convey the quality of <strong>The Fire Last Time</strong>, I
find myself searching rather desperately for relevant comparisons.</p>

<p>It cannot be compared with even the best works of Marxist academic
history (Hill, Thompson, de Ste Croix, etc.) which take a period in
the distant past and study it in enormous detail, for, while it is
not scholarly in that sense, it operates on a far wider scale and, in
dealing with virtually contemporary history, it tackles problems that
are both more difficult and more pressing. What do spring to mind are
some of the classics of the Marxist tradition: Luxemburg&rsquo;s <strong>The
Mass Strike</strong>, Trotsky&rsquo;s <strong>1905</strong>, even Marx&rsquo;s
<strong>Eighteenth Brumaire</strong>. I have no wish either to flatter Chris or
to embarrass him, so I should say promptly that he does not have
Marx&rsquo;s genius for expressing the profoundest theoretical
insight in a brilliant epigram, or Luxemburg&rsquo;s magnificent
revolutionary &eacute;lan or Trotsky&rsquo;s extraordinary confidence
and dialectical sharpness so the comparison doesn&rsquo;t really
stand. That it should even arise is praise enough. Certainly it is a
model of Marxist historical writing and particularly striking is the
sure-footed way it moves from country to country, struggle to
struggle, constantly relating the details of a specific episode to
the total picture.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best way of bringing out the politics of Harman&rsquo;s
book is to show how its treatment of a number of key issues differs
from that of the other three authors. This has the added bonus of
focussing on some of the arguments about the legacy of 1968 that are
likely to arise on the left in this anniversary year.</p>

<p>First the question of what caused the upheaval. As we have seen,
neither Caute nor Ali, nor even Fraser seriously addresses this
question. In so far as they offer an answer it is, essentially, the
Vietnam War. The importance of Vietnam is obvious, especially in
America, and there is no doubt that internationally it was the most
frequently recurring issue, the common thread linking protest
demonstrations in &lsquo;London, Paris, Rome, Berlin&rsquo; etc. In
itself, however, the war will not suffice as an explanation, for even
the most vicious and disastrous colonial war (Algeria is another
example) would not have had the effect it did if it had not
intersected with ripening contradictions inside the capitalist
heartlands.</p>

<p>Harman approaches this problem systematically. He begins by
describing the state of the world pre-1968, &lsquo;the long calm&rsquo;
that accompanied the post-war boom and its ideological reflection in
the theories of such diverse intellectuals as Crosland, Strachey,
Parsons, Bell, Marcuse, Barran and Sweezy. All of these,
notwithstanding their radically different viewpoints, assumed that
western capitalism had solved its basic economic problems and
permanently incorporated the working class. Harman demonstrates that,
while the facts underlying this view were real enough, it was a
profoundly false and one-sided generalisation. On the one hand it was
based solely on the situation of north-west Europe, the American deep
south and Northern Ireland where quite different economic, social and
political conditions prevailed. On the other hand it ignored the way</p>

<p class="quoteb">economic expansion itself bred cumulative changes in the
structure of the world system which were bound, eventually, to call
into question the foundations of political stability. (<strong>The Fire
Next Time</strong>, p.&nbsp;5)</p>

<p class="fst">Here Harman points first to the contradictions inherent in the
permanent arms economy which permitted the lesser powers (Germany,
Japan, etc.) to take advantage of the boom conditions sustained by
America&rsquo;s unparalleled arms spending without themselves having
to pay for them and thus enabled them to enjoy rates of growth which
eventually undermined US hegemony. This in turn led the US to attempt
to reassert its dominance in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Secondly Harman notes how the boom produced a massive process of
urbanisation and proletarianisation which gradually reshaped the
whole social structure. This had a particularly dramatic effect in
the more backward sectors of advanced capitalism (southern Europe,
southern USA, Ireland, etc.) where the old attitudes of rural
deference and small farmer conservatism on which the authoritarian
regimes in those sectors had rested were steadily uprooted. In this
way the social foundation was laid for the later rise of
working-class militancy and revolts against Jim Crow racism,
Gaullism, Orangeism and the Mediterranean dictatorships.</p>

<p>Thirdly Harman shows how, as part of the same process, the boom
transformed the position of students, enlarging their numbers and
lowering their status and conditions, with the result that by the
sixties, &lsquo;neither in class origin nor class destination were
students &ldquo;the children of the bourgeoisie&rdquo;.&rsquo; (<strong>The
Fire Last Time</strong>, p.&nbsp;41). Moreover he explains how</p>

<p class="quoteb">The transitional relationship between students and the
different classes of society and their allotted role as transmitters
of the ruling ideology make students especially sensitive to
ideological crisis in the wider society. If that ideology is in
palpable contradiction with reality as they experience it, they are
themselves thrown into intellectual turmoil and can react with moral
indignation. (<strong>The Fire Last Time</strong>, p.&nbsp;42)</p>

<p class="fst">Thus whereas in Caute, Ali and Fraser sixty-eight appears as an
almost miraculous eruption, a sudden moral revolt against the horror
of Vietnam and the values of &lsquo;consumer society&rsquo;, Harman
uncovers its material roots, including the material roots of the
moral revolt. Whereas in Caute, Ali and Fraser the student rebellion
is seen as essentially separate in origin and course from the
struggles of the working class, Harman is able to treat both student
and worker militancy as responses to the changes undergone by
international capitalism and thus trace the underlying connections
between the movements of sixty-eight and the great period of
working-class struggle that followed in Britain, Italy, Spain, Greece
and Portugal.</p>

<p>The question of causation leads on directly to a second key issue
&ndash; that of revolutionary continuity. A widespread view, echoed
more or less in the three other books, is of a sixties &lsquo;mood&rsquo;
unconnected with revolutionary movements in the past and now
definitely over, never to return. This, indeed, was how it seemed
(and seems) to the majority of activists &ndash; the proportion of
militants with a political memory or political consciousness
stretching back to earlier revolutionary periods was infinitesimally
small. For Harman, however (and here again we see the superiority of
Marxism over subjective impressionism), &lsquo;1968 is a year of
international revolution no less than 1793, 1830, 1848, 1917 and
1936&rsquo; (<strong>The Fire Last Time</strong>, p.&nbsp;152). In other words
it is one episode, one high point in an ongoing class struggle that
is inherent in the existence of a class-divided society and that
<em>continues today.</em></p>

<p>Harman is not, of course, suggesting that nothing has changed. He
traces meticulously how all the movements born in the late sixties
eventually ran into the sand and how in 1974&ndash;76 there came &lsquo;a
second turning point&rsquo; in which</p>

<p class="quoteb">the structures by which ruling classes maintained their
own internal coherence and ruled the rest of society were repaired &ndash;
in the most extreme cases virtually rebuilt. (<strong>The Fire Last Time</strong>,
p.&nbsp;339)</p>

<p class="fst">He shows how the characteristic form taken by the restabilisation
was a pact between government, big business and the reformist labour
leaderships (the Social Contract, the Pact of Moncloa, the Historic
Compromise) which induced the working class to acquiesce in attacks
on its living standards that would have been fiercely resisted in
earlier years, which in turn paved the way for a new period of calm
and a general swing to the right. But, Harman insists, this new
stabilisation is no more permanent than its predecessor in the
fifties. Indeed it is a lot less firmly based because of the overall
economic crisis of the world system. For this reason the ruling
classes have every reason to fear, and we have every reason to hope
for, &lsquo;another sixty-eight&rsquo;.</p>

<p>This revolutionary perspective gives Harman&rsquo;s book a purpose
and coherence completely lacking in the other accounts. It also leads
him to devote considerable attention to an aspect of the struggle
which they treat only in passing and with a certain disdain &ndash;
the question of revolutionary organisation. For Caute, Fraser and
even Ali, the various revolutionary groups, organisations and
embryonic parties which arose or played a role in 1968 are just part
of the general kaleidoscope of events. For Harman they represent
various attempts to solve a fundamental problem &ndash; the creation
of a revolutionary party of the working class, i.e. the instrument
indispensable to any ultimate victory, whose absence made a crucial
difference on a number of occasions in these years (May &rsquo;68 in
France, Portugal 1975 for example). He therefore takes the groups&rsquo;
ideas and activity seriously and the result is a fascinating account
of the development and trials of the revolutionary left.</p>

<p>What particularly distinguishes this account is that it avoids
getting bogged down in sectarian minutiae. Harman&rsquo;s focus is
always on the relationship between theory and practice, on how the
ideas of the revolutionaries assist or hinder them giving a lead to
the various spontaneous movements when they arise, and on their
capacity to keep revolutionary activity on course in periods when it
is necessary to swim against the tide. In this way the story of the
revolutionary left is integrated into the analysis of the class
struggle as a whole.</p>

<p>The revolutionary groups of 1968 and after suffered from many
defects, most obviously smallness, inexperience and isolation from
the working class. This, however, was more or less unavoidable given
the nature of the immediately preceding period. More serious in the
long run, Harman shows, was their confused politics. Arising in a
period when the classical Marxist tradition had been all but
obliterated, they by and large turned for their ideas to a mixture of
theories adopted and adapted from third world nationalism &ndash;
Fanon, Guevarism and Maoism. Even some of the Trotskyist groups were
similarly infected (as Tariq&rsquo;s book reveals).</p>

<p>When the struggle was advancing, these ideas tended to fill the
revolutionaries&rsquo; heads with dreams of instant revolution (&lsquo;The
duty of a revolutionary is to make the revolution&rsquo; said
Guevara) which diverted them from the crucial task of gaining a base
in the working class. When these expectations were shattered on the
rocks of reality and it became necessary to retreat, such ideas
offered no basis for coming to terms with the new situation and led
in the main to collapse and disillusionment.</p>

<p>This, of course, is a generalisation. Italy is the extreme case
where the largest revolutionary left in Europe destroyed itself in
the space of a couple of years; Britain, where the influence of
Maoism was minimal and where the SWP was able to maintain itself
during the downturn, is something of an exception. Nevertheless it
has not been a question of returning to square one. Just as
capitalism has not been able to restore the secure economic and
political conditions of the fifties, so revolutionary socialist ideas
are nothing like as marginalised as they were in the fifty years that
preceded 1968.</p>

<p>Which brings me to a final crucial difference between <strong>The Fire
Last Time</strong> and the other books: the audience they are written for.
Caute&rsquo;s book, as far as one can judge, is aimed at &lsquo;the
general public&rsquo; with only a passing interest in 1968; Tariq&rsquo;s
and Fraser&rsquo;s (despite its great merits) cater primarily for the
left nostalgia market referred to at the beginning of the article;
only Harman has written a book for the revolutionaries of today, that
is a book which reviews the past in order to look to the future and
which will serve as a real guide to action.</p>

<p>In so doing he has provided a unique analysis of a period of
international history rich in lessons for present and forthcoming
battles. It also contains many specific analyses &ndash; of the
British upturn, of the Portuguese revolution, of the end of the
Franco regime and so on &ndash; which could not be properly discussed
in this review but which are of great value and interest in
themselves. It should be bought and read by every reader of this
journal.</p>
