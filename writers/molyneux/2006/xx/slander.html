<strong>Trotsky</strong><br/>
<em>Pearson Longman, 2006, &#163;14.99</em></p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;Readers of this biography&#8217;, writes Geoffrey Swain, Professor
in Russian and East European Studies at Glasgow University, &#8216;will
not find their way to Trotskyism.&#8217; Well, some might despite the
author&#8217;s best intentions, but this cannot be regarded as an overstatement.</p>

<p>There are now many books on the life and politics of Leon Trotsky
<a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> and this is one of the worst. It casually, but outrageously and
repeatedly, slanders Trotsky. Perhaps such slander should be ignored,
but I, for one, am fed up with the casual &#8216;academic&#8217; slandering
of great revolutionaries. Such books do real damage. They find their
way onto university booklists, especially the booklists for the
author&#8217;s courses, and exercise an influence on some students. They
say, with the full weight of academic authority behind them, &#8216;Don&#8217;t
even begin to look to Trotsky (or Marx or Lenin &#8211; Lenin is a
favourite for this kind of treatment) for an intellectual alternative
to the present system,&#8217; and, inevitably, many of the students lack
the resources to reply or even to discern the fraud that is being
perpetrated. I, therefore, intend to respond &#8211; without academic diplomacy.</p>

<p>Swain does not hang about. On page 3 of his introduction he offers
the following assessment of Trotsky&#8217;s intellectual capacity and
theoretical contribution:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Trotsky scholars might be surprised to find in this
biography that there are no references to Baruch Knei-Paz&#8217;s great
study <strong>The Social and Political Thought of Leon Trotsky</strong> ...
[his] approach makes Trotsky a far greater thinker than he was in
reality. Trotsky wrote an enormous amount and, as a journalist, was
always happy to write on subjects about which he knew very little.
Trotsky could write beautifully, but he was no philosopher. Knei-Paz
does a better job than Trotsky himself in synthesising his ideas.
Trotsky was a jobbing journalist and revolutionary activist and his
writings cannot be divorced from their context. Trotsky&#8217;s first
revolutionary comrade, Grigorii Ziv, doubted that Trotsky had the
patience to fully engage with Marxism as an intellectual tool. A
similar verdict came from Lunarcharskii ... [who] concluded ... &#8220;He
is as bold as can be in opposing liberalism and semi-socialism, but
he is no innovator&#8221;.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Leaving aside the merits of Knei-Paz <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>, this is, by any
standards, a monstrous, in legal terms &#8216;perverse&#8217;, judgment. I am
well aware that journalism can be an honourable profession &#8211; one
thinks of John Reed, Paul Foot, John Pilger, Eamonn McCann, Robert
Fisk (all of them more than journalists) &#8211; but to describe the
author of <strong>The History of the Russian Revolution</strong> as just a
&#8216;jobbing journalist&#8217; is laughable. No, it is slander of the first order.</p>

<p>For those  who have read <strong>The History</strong> further comment is
superfluous; for those who have not it is in three volumes, runs to
more than 1,200 pages, and combines in one majestic whole a broad
theoretical analysis of the revolution&#8217;s place in history and an
exposition of its internal dynamic as it unfolded day by day in the
deeds and thoughts of the different classes and parties and their
leading, and not so leading, spokespersons. It is widely considered
to be the greatest historical work of the 20th century. Nor does <strong>The
History</strong> stand alone: Trotsky&#8217;s other major theoretical works
include <strong>Results and Prospects</strong> (which sets out the theory of
permanent revolution), <strong>The Third International After Lenin</strong>,
<strong>The Struggle Against Fascism in Germany</strong> (which to date remains
the foremost Marxist analysis of Nazism and how to fight it), <strong>The
Revolution Betrayed</strong> and <strong>Literature and Revolution</strong>. Swain
&#8216;deals&#8217; with this large body of inconvenient evidence by simply
ignoring it. Not a single one of the works I have cited, nor the
theoretical analyses they contain, are either summarised or discussed
anywhere in Swain&#8217;s book.</p>

<p>Instead Swain offers as corroboration a quotation from the
esteemed Ziv (whose own contribution to Marxist theory stands at
zero), who only knew Trotsky as a youth and whose last, fleeting,
contact with him appears to have been in New York in early 1917, by
which time Ziv had become a supporter of the First World War. This is
backed by a quote from Lunarcharskii, which dates from 1923 (before
most of Trotsky&#8217;s main theoretical works were written), which is
unrepresentative of Lunarcharskii&#8217;s overall assessment of Trotsky
and which is anyway palpably false: Trotsky&#8217;s theory of permanent
revolution is clearly one of the most important innovations in
Marxist theory since Marx, likewise his analysis of fascism. This is
a bit like saying Shakespeare was a good comic dramatist but couldn&#8217;t
handle tragedy and then writing a book about him which doesn&#8217;t
mention <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>King Lear</em> and <em>Macbeth</em>.</p>

<p>Even worse, because it denies one of the central principles of
Trotsky&#8217;s entire life, is the following assertion, also in the
introduction but repeated in the conclusion:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;There is little [in this book] about world revolution.
Trotsky believed in world revolution, but no more and no less than
every other Bolshevik, and like all other Bolsheviks this belief was
largely rhetorical ... It was only in exile in 1933 that
internationalism actually became central to Trotsky&#8217;s
purpose&#8217; (pp.&nbsp;2&#8211;3).</p>

<p class="fst">Here only the first sentence is true. The rest is arrogant
garbage. Reading the comment on the Bolsheviks I could not avoid
thinking of Professor Swain secure in his Chair at Glasgow University
and wondering whether this man had ever in his life held a principle
for which he was required to make a serious sacrifice. The Bolsheviks
were men and women who risked their liberty and their lives for their
ideas, who suffered, not by way of exception, but virtually as a rule
imprisonment, Siberia and exile, and who, almost alone among Europe&#8217;s
socialist parties, took an internationalist position in August 1914.
And he has the gall to say they were not serious about their beliefs.</p>

<p>As for Trotsky, the evidence for the centrality of
internationalism to his theory and practice long before 1933 is so
abundant that to present even the main body of it would fill this
whole journal. In 1904 Trotsky opposed the Russo-Japanese War on an
internationalist basis. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> The theory of permanent revolution
developed in 1905&#8211;06 is internationalist in its premise &#8211;
Russia&#8217;s combined and uneven development is a product of its
relationship to international capitalism; and in its conclusion &#8211;
that a victorious socialist revolution in Russia would be able to
sustain itself only if the revolution spread to Europe. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> In his
years of exile prior to 1917 Trotsky was actively engaged with the
revolutionary movement in a number of countries, including Austria,
the Balkans, France and the US. In 1914 he, with the Bolsheviks and
Luxemburg and Liebknecht, was one of the few to remain loyal to
internationalism and played a leading role in the famous anti-war
Zimmerwald Conference in 1915. After October he was appointed
Commissar for Foreign Affairs, in part because of his
internationalism, and at Brest-Litovsk he, at first, refused
(mistakenly) to sign a peace with the Germans on internationalist
grounds. From 1919 to 1922 he played an active and leading part in
the Communist International. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p>Swain knows all this and mentions much of it but only as isolated
individual &#8216;facts&#8217; and he does not allow these facts to affect
his argument. He even claims that Trotsky really supported Stalin&#8217;s
doctrine of socialism in one country. He bases this claim on
Trotsky&#8217;s silence on the question in 1925&#8211;26 (which was for
tactical reasons and did not at all signify agreement) and a couple
of quotes taken out of context from Trotsky&#8217;s discussions of
economic construction. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> He completely ignores a) that Trotsky had
opposed socialism in one country in advance in <strong>Results and
Prospects</strong>, and b) Trotsky&#8217;s major theoretical critiques of
socialism in one country in <strong>The Third International After Lenin</strong>
(which runs to 72 pages and predicts with striking accuracy the
effect the doctrine will have on the international communist
movement), <strong>Permanent Revolution</strong> and <em>Appendix II</em> of <strong>The
History of the Russian Revolution</strong> &#8211; all of which were written
before 1933.</p>

<p>Faced with the undeniable importance of international questions
(principally Germany 1923, Britain 1926 and China 1925&#8211;27) for
Trotsky in these years, Swain has a neat solution:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;His critique of the failed German Revolution in 1923
was simply camouflage for an attack on his then domestic opponents
Zinoviev and Kamenev. It was the same with his writings on the
British General Strike, although here his opponents were Bukharin and
Stalin. As to his enthusiasm for China in 1927, that too was
essentially domestic in focus, for Chiang Kai-shek&#8217;s destruction of
the Chinese Communist Party was simply a metaphor for Thermidor, for
what would happen in Russia if the kulaks ever found a general&#8217; (p.&nbsp;3).</p>

<p class="fst">Swain is trading, for this cheap slur, on his audience not having
read the texts in question, for it is hard to imagine how anyone who
had read them, with their combination of passionate polemic and
theoretical acuity (I wish I had space to quote them) could accept
his cynical interpretation. Nevertheless it is obviously a line of
argument with a future. How about, &#8216;The anti Vietnam War protesters
didn&#8217;t care about Vietnam, they just had a grudge against LBJ over
the draft&#8217;? Or, &#8216;The SWP only opposed the wars on Afghanistan,
Iraq and Lebanon because of what Blair was doing on privatisation and
the Labour Party&#8217;? Nearer the mark might be, &#8216;Swain has no real
interest in Trotsky, he has only written this book for the money and
another entry on his publication list.&#8217;</p>

<p>Sadly, refuting slanders takes much longer than issuing them and
it is therefore impossible in the space of a review to pursue any but
the grossest of Swain&#8217;s falsehoods and misrepresentations. One that
has to be noted, however, is his insistent repetition of the old
Stalinist charge that Trotsky &#8216;underestimated the peasantry&#8217;.
Swain tells us that &#8216;Trotsky&#8217;s attitude to the peasantry was his
Achilles&#8217; heel&#8217; (p.&nbsp;216). In fact Trotsky never denied, in
theory or in practice, that the peasants would play a crucial role in
the Russian Revolution. What he argued was that the peasantry was
unable to play an independent role, i.e. independent of the
leadership of one of the main urban classes, the bourgeoisie or the
proletariat. In this Trotsky based himself on Marx&#8217;s famous
analysis of the peasantry in <strong>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis
Bonaparte</strong> and the whole history of peasant revolt in Russia and
internationally. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> Moreover he was vindicated by the actual course
of the Russian Revolution.</p>

<p>What the Stalinists did in accusing Trotsky of &#8216;underestimating
the peasantry&#8217; was run together, in a single demagogic phrase,
Trotsky&#8217;s attitude to the peasantry before and after the October
Revolution. Prior to the revolution the &#8216;underestimation&#8217;
consisted of rejecting Lenin&#8217;s view that the existence of a large
peasant majority in Russia excluded the establishment of workers&#8217;
power (in this Trotsky was proved right). After the revolution it
consisted of overestimating the obstacle the peasants constituted to
the construction of socialism and exaggerating the threat of kulak
(rich peasant) inspired counter-revolution. If Trotsky did exaggerate
the kulak threat it was not because he was wrong about the peasants
but because he underestimated the threat posed by the Stalinist
bureaucracy. Swain sheds no light on this question, but simply echoes
the Stalinist line.</p>

<p>Swain&#8217;s book also contains an absolutely astonishing omission.
There is no mention of, not a single sentence on, Trotsky&#8217;s
campaign in 1930&#8211;33, from exile in Prinkipo, to alert the German
Communist Party to the danger posed by Hitler, to criticise the
strategy imposed by Stalin, and to urge the formation of a united
front against the Nazis. Given the brilliance of Trotsky&#8217;s writings
on the subject and the extreme importance of the events, this
omission amounts virtually to historical censorship. How can it
possibly be justified? Not, I assume, by ignorance, or by
considerations of space &#8211; Swain manages to devote a couple of pages
to Trotsky&#8217;s affair with Frida Kahlo (the priorities of the <strong>News
of the World</strong> at work here, I suspect), and whole sections to the
relatively minor episodes such as the Vienna <strong>Pravda</strong> of 1908&#8211;10
and the Vienna Conference of 1912. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> Presumably Swain did not think
he could get away with claiming that for Trotsky Hitler was just a &#8216;metaphor&#8217;.</p>

<p>The book also says next to nothing about such minor matters as the
Spanish Civil War, the Moscow Trials, the international slander and
persecution of Trotsky as a fascist agent, Stalin&#8217;s purges and
gulag, or the little question of whether socialism was actually built
in the USSR. Trotsky&#8217;s spats with Victor Serge and Ante Ciliga are,
however, featured, while the struggle for the Fourth International
is, of course, dismissed as a trivial irrelevance.</p>

<p>All these slanders, distortions and omissions do serve a purpose,
however. Swain&#8217;s avowed focus is on the period when Trotsky was in
power or near to power, the decade of 1917&#8211;27 and the years of
Trotsky&#8217;s direct struggle with Stalin. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> What they enable Swain
to do is to treat that struggle in largely personal terms, as a
battle for power between rival individuals, devoid of real principles
and in isolation from wider social forces (I imagine he thinks of it
as something like the rivalry between Blair and Brown). He attributes
Trotsky&#8217;s defeat partly to &#8216;personality failings&#8217;,
characteristic of Trotsky from his youth, partly to a &#8216;disagreement
about how the party should operate&#8217;, with Lenin as much as with
Stalin, and partly to his &#8216;ideological obsession with the kulak
danger&#8217; (p.&nbsp;4). I doubt Swain realises it but this is all
taken more or less directly from Stalin. It is not only factually
false but also a miserably inadequate methodology &#8211; a species of
the long discredited &#8216;great man&#8217; theory of history.</p>

<p>&#8216;History&#8217;, wrote Marx, &#8216;is the history of class struggle.&#8217;
This applies as much to Russia in the 1920s as it does to everywhere
else. Trotsky lost to Stalin because at the time in question the
social force he represented &#8211; the working class &#8211; was weaker than
the social force Stalin represented, the rising bureaucracy. There
were two ways in which Trotsky could have won: through the victory of
the international revolution or, possibly, through abandoning the
working class to engage in an unprincipled personal power struggle &#8211;
in that case he would have ceased to be Trotsky. That the first
option did not materialise is Trotsky&#8217;s and humanity&#8217;s tragedy;
that he rejected the second, despite extraordinary difficulties and
pressures, is his greatness. Swain&#8217;s inability or unwillingness to
comprehend any of this leaves him with the distinction of having
produced what is probably the most mendacious account of Trotsky
since the days of high Stalinism.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h3 class="western">Notes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> These include Isaac Deutscher&#8217;s magnificent trilogy, <strong>The Prophet Armed</strong>, <strong>The Prophet Unarmed</strong> and <strong>The Prophet
Outcast</strong>; Tony Cliff&#8217;s <strong>Trotsky</strong> (4&nbsp;vols.); Pierre
Brou&#233;, <strong>Trotsky</strong>; Victor Serge and Natalya Sedova, <strong>The Life
and Death of Leon Trotsky</strong>; Ernest Mandel&#8217;s <strong>Trotsky &#8211; a
Study in the Unity of his Thought</strong> and <strong>Trotsky as Alternative</strong>;
Baruch Knei-Paz, <strong>The Social and Political Thought of Leon Trotsky</strong>;
Ian Thatcher, <strong>Trotsky</strong>; Dimitry Volkogonov, <strong>Trotsky: the
Eternal Revolutionary</strong>; John Molyneux, <strong>Leon Trotsky&#8217;s Theory
of Revolution</strong>; Duncan Hallas, <strong>Trotsky&#8217;s Marxism</strong>. Of
these Deutscher&#8217;s is the finest literary-historical achievement,
Cliff&#8217;s the best and most detailed politically, and Hallas&#8217;s the
best introduction. Unsurprisingly Cliff, Mandel, Hallas and Molyneux
receive no mention in either Swain&#8217;s book or his bibliography &#8211;
presumably lest the readers might find their way to Trotskyism!</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f2" name="n2">2.</a> Long ago I wrote a highly critical review of Knei-Paz&#8217;s book
for the <strong>Critique</strong> journal. Unfortunately I cannot find a
reference for it, but it was reprinted in H. Ticktin and M. Cox
(<em>eds.</em>), <strong>The Ideas of Leon Trotsky</strong> (London, 1995).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f3" name="n3">3.</a> Bizarrely for his own argument, Swain actually records this
fact (p.&nbsp;18) but presumably fails to notice the contradiction.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f4" name="n4">4.</a> Again Swain quotes Trotsky to this effect (p.&nbsp;29).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f5" name="n5">5.</a> Trotsky&#8217;s articles and speeches fill two volumes &#8211; see Leon Trotsky, <strong>The First Five Years of the Communist International</strong>, vols.&nbsp;1 and 2 (New York 1972).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f6" name="n6">6.</a> Trotsky&#8217;s silence in 1925&#8211;26 was one of a number of
hesitations and tactical compromises he made in order to avoid an
irrevocable split. In my view these were mistakes and derived
ultimately from Trotsky&#8217;s failure, because of his lack of a theory
of state capitalism, to see that the Stalinist bureaucracy could
become a new ruling class. These matters are discussed in some detail
in J. Molyneux, <strong>Leon Trotsky&#8217;s Theory of Revolution</strong>, and T.
Cliff, <strong>Trotsky: Resisting the Stalinist Degeneration</strong> (vol.&nbsp;3).
What Swain does is exploit these hesitations to misrepresent
Trotsky&#8217;s fundamental views.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f7" name="n7">7.</a> There is a basic Marxist principle at stake here. Until very
recently the overwhelming majority of the world&#8217;s exploited and
oppressed were peasants, not workers. If it were not for this
political weakness, produced by their objective economic and social
circumstances, they and not the proletariat would be the main
revolutionary class, as was argued by the Narodniks in Russia and by
various third worldists in the 1960s.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f8" name="n8">8.</a> What these events do show is Trotsky at odds with Lenin, and
Swain follows the Stalinist practice of highlighting every
disagreement with Lenin, no matter how minor or superseded by history.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f9" name="n9">9.</a> Swain claims that &#8216;the decision to concentrate on the years
in power enabled me to do justice for the first time to Trotsky and
Russia&#8217;s Civil War&#8217;(p.&nbsp;2). Our ideas of justice obviously
differ, but, once again, this is not even factually true. Tony Cliff,
unmentioned by Swain, dealt with the Civil War and Trotsky&#8217;s role
in it, at greater length and in greater detail (and with much greater
political understanding) in <strong>Trotsky: the Sword of the Revolution</strong> (vol.&nbsp;2).</p>
