<p class="fst">How many failed interventions can the world tolerate? Since the
end of the Cold War we have seen a succession of attempts, led by the
US and its supporters, to use military power ostensibly to solve
local problems. But whatever the immediate effect of the
intervention, the long term result has been to leave the underlying
problems unresolved and even more difficult to resolve. Somalia,
Bosnia, Kosovo-Serbia, Afghanistan and now Iraq &#8211; the list grows.
But as one intervention has succeeded another, interest seems to fade
in the consequences of earlier actions. But these consequences remain
to be dealt with by the local populations and they can contain the
seeds of future conflicts. It is important therefore for socialists
not only to expose the immediate hypocrisies behind the interventions
but also to look beyond them to the nature of the wider imperial
system. This requires an analysis of the present, but also a more
adequate understanding of the past.</p>

<p>The <strong>Balkan Socialist Tradition: Balkan Socialism and the Balkan
Federation</strong>, edited by Andreja Zivkovic and Dragan Plavsic, is a
major documentary collection of articles from the pre-1914
international and Balkan socialist movement that have never appeared
in English before. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> It will enormously advance our understanding
both of development in the Balkans and the way in which the Balkan
left responded. Published as a book length issue of the journal
<strong>Revolutionary History</strong>, it is edited to the highest standards
with a strong commentary, detailed footnotes, a glossary and clear
maps, all of which explain the context of the writings and provide a
wealth of historical information. My only regret is that an index has
not been added to help those who wish to track the way issues of
detail were used as the debates of the time developed.</p>

<p>To get most benefit from the debates translated here it is
necessary to have a general understanding of Balkan developments but
readers who followed the arguments at the time of the last NATO
attack should have what is necessary and there are now a number of
short background accounts that can also be recommended to those who
want more. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> But all those who wrote in English on this topic would
have benefited from having this collection to hand, for even the most
cursory skimming of the text reveals how partial and impoverished our
understanding of the Balkan past and the role of the left within it
has often been.</p>

<p>Before 1914 Balkan socialists struggled with issues that are still
with us today. Capitalism came late to this region as it did to most
of the world. But it showed little capacity to deliver harmonious
development. Instead it encouraged the development of a region of
suspicious statelets with competing claims to the loyalty of the
local population. (Today, of course, with the fragmentation of the
former Yugoslavia the division is even greater.) Moreover it did this
in an area which had become the focus of great power rivalries and in
which local conflicts inevitably became mixed up with outside interests.</p>

<p>The Balkans could not remain as it was. Small states with narrow
local markets and competing interests were no basis for stability.
One solution might have been unity through the expansion of a single
state &#8211; the way that Prussia unified Germany or Piedmont
effectively unified Italy. But no single Balkan state had the means
to do this, nor were the Great Powers interested in allowing it to
happen. Another solution was some kind of federation or alliance from
above. This briefly and partially came about in 1912 as Bulgaria,
Greece, Montenegro and Serbia ganged up on their fellow Balkan state
Turkey. But this partial alliance immediately fell apart in the
Second Balkan War in 1913 where Greece and Serbia, now joined by
Romania, went to war with Bulgaria over the spoils of the first war.</p>

<p>The alternative that emerged on the radical left was to fight for
a Balkan federation from below by challenging both the local states
and the imperial interests that helped to guide them. This idea of
federation from below was not simply a slogan to be painted on a
banner. It emerged from the fight against the nationalist policies of
the individual states and a growing understanding of the nature of
the new age of imperialism.</p>

<p>Crucial here was a changed appreciation of the role of Russia. In
the mid-19th century Marx and Engels had seen a backward but
politically and militarily strong Russia as the major obstacle to the
advance of capitalism, democracy and eventually socialism. In 1914
some socialists still saw things this way and Russophobia was an
important tradition in both Germany and Austro-Hungarian socialism.
But in the late 19th century not only did the power of Russia visibly
weaken but after 1900 it now became part of a wider imperialist
system in which the dominant powers would sometimes co-operate and
sometimes compete with one another to redivide the world and manage
their interests. As this happened the issue became more and more one
of opposition to the imperialist system as a whole. This is the
context for the detailed discussions in the contemporary documents
discussed in this book. And they will reveal to the interested reader
jewels hitherto hidden as well as a tradition of socialist activism
in the most difficult circumstances that still stands out today.
Let&#8217;s take some examples.</p>

<p>The crisis that led to the First World War began with the
assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo by
Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist. Austria took this as a
pretext to crush Serbia and the Great Powers lined up on two sides to
fight. Faced with the threat of European war most socialists in
Europe, organised in the Second International, threw aside their
internationalism to support their own countries&#8217; war efforts. Lenin
and the Bolsheviks in Russia did not. But how many people know that
neither did many Balkan socialists? And how many know that in Serbia,
as the Austrian armies advanced and socialists came under the most
enormous pressure imaginable, some still held up the banner of
internationalism? Here we have, for example, the speech of Dragisa
Lapcevic, who with enormous courage opposed the war in the Serbian
parliament even as the Serbian armies were being hammered by the
first blows of the Austrian military. Here we have the bitter lament
of Dusan Popovic as he records the problems of editing an anti-war
paper in Serbia while he tries to come to terms with the war-death of
one of the great Balkan socialists of the day, Dmitrije Tucovic. The
stand of people like this and others in neighbouring states was only
possible because of the clarity with which leading members of the
left in the Balkans saw the decisive issue as one of an imperialist
war which relegated local issues to the background. The memory of
their stand reinforces all the opprobrium that history has
subsequently heaped on western socialists who in far less difficult
conditions took weaker positions.</p>

<p>The arguments of these Balkan socialists developed under the
umbrella of the Second International. But the book also makes clear
how our understanding of these debates often underplays their
sophistication and complexity. This is partly a product of the
failure of 1914 and the inevitable tendency to concentrate on the bad
elements that led to it. But this is to neglect the good, which also
existed, and the way in which socialist theorists tried to confront
the ways the world was changing. Part of the reason figures like
Lenin and Luxemburg were so shocked by the betrayals of August 1914
was their recognition of the positive contributions that had been
made before. Kautsky suffered particularly here and if he is seen
only in terms of his positions after 1914 and 1917 and through his
widely translated popular tracts it is difficult to understand why he
was so important. But a reading of his sharp analysis of the problems
of the Ottoman Empire translated here should persuade even the most
sceptical that, whatever his failings, here was also a man of great insight.</p>

<p>But our misunderstandings are also a consequence of the prism
created by Stalinism and anti-Stalinism. The former we can now
discount, but in doing so there has been a tendency to rely on
Trotsky and his friend and fellow left oppositionist Christian
Rakovsky for guidance on the issues at stake in the Balkans.
Trotsky&#8217;s writings as war correspondent in the Balkans in 1912 to
1913 are an invaluable source and a classic of their kind, but his
appreciation of the debates of the time was sometimes wanting. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>
The collection does not translate, for example, a robust rebuttal of
Trotsky by Dimutur Blagoev, a great Bulgarian Marxist practically
unheard of outside the Balkans. It does, however translate Blagoev&#8217;s
blunt dismissal of Christian Rakovsky who at this point was both
trying to help paper over critical differences and also too naively
viewing the potential of development from above for resolving the
problems in the Balkans. This is not to say the positions adopted at
the time were and are unquestionable. In one section, for example,
Dragan Plavsic raises uncomfortable questions about the response of
Balkan socialists to the First Balkan War. Rather the issue is that
there was both a serious debate and no sense of the need to defer to
authority in a way that represents the best tradition of socialist
discussion. Here were people who were self-confident in their
arguments and who had a political credibility to match it, but who
subsequently became lost to history until this book helped to
resurrect them for a new century.</p>

<p>But the collection also helps us understand the deficiencies in
some other positions. Perhaps the most important here are the
problems that the Austro-Marxists had in dealing with the national
and imperial questions of the time. Those on the left today who are
inclined to be sympathetic to the abstract attractions of their
arguments about solving the national problem through fighting for
cultural autonomy within big states will learn much here from the way
in which this position crumbled towards a <em>de facto</em> support of
big powers when confronted with real issues like Bosnia before 1914.</p>

<p>As the collection proceeds the editors note striking parallels
between issues raised before 1914 and recent events. But they also
recognise that the problem is not one of using the past as a stick
with which to beat people in the present. Rather through a better
understanding of the past we can gain a better understanding of the
present and therefore also have a better chance of going beyond it.
Those of us who opposed Western intervention in the former Yugoslavia
in the 1990s were hostilely received by many on the liberal left &#8211;
including those who had previously stood with us. But our sense that
a dangerous pattern was being created has been vindicated by events
and the tradition we helped to precipitate has become part of a wider
movement of opposition that can be seen in the protests against the
war on Iraq. This book (and with it Misha Glenny&#8217;s <strong>The Balkans
1804&#8211;1999: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers</strong>, London 2000)
has given birth to a serious attempt to lay the basis for a deeper
understanding of the Balkans that puts at our service the best
traditions of historical research and co-operative translation. As
the problems of Western intervention extend we will need to combine
more a general education in the history of imperialism and resistance
to it with detailed and genuinely &#8216;scientific&#8217; accounts in the
best sense. It is good to have this kind of book therefore not only
for what it tells us about its subject but as a model for others to
emulate for other places at other times.</p>
