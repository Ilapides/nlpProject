<em>Manchester University Press, 2006, &#163;15.99</em></p>

<p class="fst">Three books in as many years are an achievement by anybody&#8217;s
standards. What Gareth Dale has done here is more &#8211; through his
discussion of the rise and fall of East Germany (the GDR) he has
staked out a claim as a major influence on our interpretation of
events in the second half of the 20th century in Europe. Whether it
will be seen that way by the left is, however, another matter.</p>

<p>Discussions of the Eastern bloc societies tend to suffer from
three problems. First, slight and poorly documented essays by left
academics seem to be valued more than substantive pieces of
theoretically and empirically engaged work. In an earlier generation
both Tony Cliff&#8217;s <strong>State Capitalism in Russia</strong> and Chris
Harman&#8217;s <strong>Class Struggles in Eastern Europe</strong> suffered from
this condescension from people who had neither produced a similarly
sustained analysis nor, it seemed, aspired to. Second, the focus of
discussion has too often been on the USSR/Russia as if Eastern Europe
were a world apart. For some the Russian &#8216;social formation/mode of
production&#8217; was so specific it had to be analysed separately from
those in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and so on. Third, the so&#8209;called
Socialist countries were also seen as a world apart from &#8216;Western
capitalism&#8217; and therefore also required a different kind of
analysis, though there was little agreement as to what that was.</p>

<p>Gareth Dale&#8217;s three books on East Germany challenge each of
these problems. He draws on a detailed knowledge of the GDR based on
personal experience of its last days, interviews, archival work and
an impressive grasp of the published literature. Second, he sees his
work as contributing to a general analysis whose implications go
beyond a society of 17 million people which in the years 1945&#8211;89
became one of the frontlines of the Cold War but which has now
disappeared. Third, he is continually engaged in a discussion which,
while it does not neglect the specific characteristics of the GDR,
nevertheless rejects the idea that this was a non-capitalist society
with a non-capitalist logic. In these terms he adds to the more
recent work of Jane Hardy and Al Rainnie on Poland <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>,
my own work and that written with Rumy Husan on Russia and Hungary
<a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>, and the discussion on the Balkans
<a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> &#8211; all of which tries to show the
importance of the analysis of this journal through a detailed
confrontation with the reality of the former Eastern bloc societies.
And it is hopefully no slight to any of us to say that in many
respects he outdoes us all.</p>

<p>But do we need a trilogy on the rise and fall of the GDR? The
answer is yes. Each of these books takes up a different theme and the
degree of overlap is limited. <strong>Between State Capitalism and
Globalisation</strong> is a major economic history. It has already
received a positive, if critical, reception, from one commentator
bemused by its combination of detailed knowledge of economic change
in the GDR and an explicit theorisation from the perspective that the
Eastern Bloc countries were state capitalist. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>
And if you are hoping that this review contains all you might ever
need to know about the GDR then pause for a moment &#8211; <strong>Between
State Capitalism and Globalisation</strong> offers more. It opens with a
long discussion of capitalism and the global economy which has value
for all of us and is the strongest published attempt to engage with
debates on state and capital from a state capitalist perspective. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
The GDR aside, it should be compulsory reading for anyone interested
in these issues.</p>

<p>State control represented what one vice-president of the GDR state
planning commission called &#8216;an attempt to transpose the economic
rationality of the capitalist enterprise onto the national economy as
a whole&#8217; (p.&nbsp;19). And it seemed to work. The 1960s saw the
high point of confidence for the ruling class in the Soviet bloc. In
the GDR Walter Ulbricht fondly imagined that it (the most advanced
Soviet bloc society) would overtake the West. But from the late 1960s
globalising forces which affected all economies began to expose the
weaknesses of the GDR approach (and that in the rest of the Soviet
bloc). Its leaders rejected isolated development in favour of greater
links to the global economy but this brought debts and dependence and
then weakened their room for manoeuvre by the end of the 1980s, and
especially in 1989.</p>

<p><strong>Popular Protest in East Germany, 1945&#8211;1989</strong> takes up the
question of the resistance. It opens with the June 1953 uprising when
workers, who had been repressed and brutally exploited, exploded in
anger in the confusion of the period immediately after Stalin&#8217;s
death. Dale argues the size of these protests in the GDR has been
consistently underestimated. They were shortlived but they &#8216;developed
at a breathtaking pace&#8217; and were only crushed &#8216;by the deployment
of ruthless military force&#8217; (p.&nbsp;10). &#8216;The situation is extremely
serious,&#8217; said the then head of the secret police. &#8216;It&#8217;s a
question of them or us&#8217; (p.&nbsp;31). Though the rising was
defeated the memory lingered on. &#8216;We sure showed them that they
can&#8217;t just do whatever they like with us,&#8217; said one worker
(p.&nbsp;33). Indeed the fear of a repeat of 1953 weighed more
heavily on the minds of the GDR ruling class even though Erich
Honecker boasted of the value of summary execution in deterring
&#8216;counter-revolution&#8217;.</p>

<p>Thereafter Dale traces the more submerged forms of resistance that
survived in the next decades, and the way that the regime used a
combination of relative prosperity, ideology, surveillance and
repression to sustain itself. He compares the arts of resistance with
those of domination, emigration and youth rebellion and the emergence
of small-scale dissident movements in the 1980s.</p>

<p>The final part of <strong>Popular Protest</strong> focuses on the 1989
revolution. For many people this is symbolised by the day that the
Berlin Wall came down, but Dale stresses it was a much longer process
with real worker involvement both on the streets and in the
factories. &#8216;Between August 1989 and April 1990, 2,600 public
demonstrations and over 300 rallies took place, as well as over 200
strikes and a dozen factory occupations. The largest three of the
2,600 demonstrations attracted well over 1 million people. No
accurate figures exist for the total number of participants in
demonstrations and public protests. That it was several million is
indisputable. One researcher has estimated the figure over 5 million&#8217;
(p.&nbsp;181). At the top the regime&#8217;s leaders were desperate for a
way out. &#8216;Erich, we can&#8217;t beat up hundreds of thousands of
people,&#8217; said secret police chief Erich Mielke to Erich Honecker.
This made a gamble on a technocratic deal with the West and
unification look increasingly attractive even if some leaders had to
be sacrificed.</p>

<p>The interesting question is why the mass movement also came to see
this a solution. Dale quotes a placard at a Christian Democrat rally:
&#8216;Helmut [Kohl], take us by the hand, show us the way to the
economic miracle land&#8217; (p.&nbsp;167). But he then rejects the idea
that such a simple material analysis is adequate, and especially so
in terms of the level of mobilisation. Here he suggests two things
were crucial. One was that the high levels of protest did not
necessarily reflect a strong belief in the people&#8217;s own capacity to
change the world. In some respects, 1953 was more radical than 1989.
The submerged character of conflict in the next decades meant that,
when things exploded, East German workers lacked the self-confidence
to strike out in a different direction. This was then compounded by
the peculiar character of the leadership that emerged.</p>

<p>The suddenness of the collapse brought to prominence a collection
of intellectuals, artists, Greens and religious figures &#8211; some of
whom played courageous roles that individually put most readers of
this journal to shame. However, collectively they found it hard to
connect. &#8216;It was always difficult to make worldly problems
intelligible to the intellectuals and artists of the opposition,&#8217;
said one worker. Indeed from the other side Dale honestly records the
problems of his own fleeting attempts to intervene. Leaders and &#8216;led&#8217;
therefore moved in different ways. In the first phase workers looked
to these &#8216;leaders&#8217; almost in spite of themselves. Then, when the
movement began to radicalise even more, its erstwhile leaders who had
been temporarily catapulted into prominence were looking to negotiate
and even join the government. Thus a gap was opened up which could
not only be capitalised on by the West German leader Helmut Kohl, but
which also provided the basis for a negotiated shift of power as a
top&#8209;down process. Dale quotes an American commentator
suggesting that unification &#8216;left little room for citizen input. It
was the hour of the policymaker and the bureaucrat. [It] relegated
people to being subjects, rather than agents of change&#8217; and of
course, there were no mass mobilisations in West Germany either.</p>

<p><strong>The East German Revolution of 1989</strong> treats these themes in
much greater detail. But Dale again stresses that it makes more sense
to investigate events in a country like the GDR in the context of a
wider understanding of &#8216;German, European and world history&#8217;. He
rejects the continuing influence of Cold War thinking on the history
of the GDR in favour of recognition of what he calls &#8216;shades of
grey&#8217; between Eastern and Western Europe. He also develops his
critical engagement with social movement theory to analyse the
interaction of the &#8216;streets&#8217; and &#8216;civic protest&#8217; groups. &#8216;Had
we related to workers&#8217; demands we could have become a lively, trade
union-linked left wing movement. Instead we became a sect,&#8217; said
one of the few workers in the New Forum civic group (p.&nbsp;228).
But he adds to this a more structured discussion of &#8216;history from
above&#8217; by looking at why the regime acted as it did. Here he
stresses the negotiated nature of the transition and the way in which
East Germany&#8217;s leaders were able, with the assistance of their
counterparts in West Germany, to undertake &#8216;a very orderly
retreat&#8217;. The rhetoric of &#8216;Communism&#8217; was used so long as state
driven competition seemed to work. When it came to the crunch and a
more market based regime seemed to offer a solution to the problems
of running the GDR &#8216;their commitments could be &#8211; and were &#8211;
abandoned without a fuss&#8217; (p.&nbsp;xi).</p>

<p>In this sense the GDR initially followed the pattern of ruling
class continuity visible elsewhere in Eastern Europe. But the GDR&#8217;s
leaders were less successful as a group because, when the transition
depression hit, they found themselves part of wider German structures
through unification. This meant that they had fewer ways of bending
the system to protect themselves so that eventually &#8216;only a
relatively thin layer of East Germany&#8217;s ruling class was able to survive&#8217;.</p>

<p>This whole analysis &#8211; its depth, detail and theorisation &#8211; is
important. This is not to say that readers will necessarily agree
with everything Dale writes. I would have liked to see more
comparative growth data used to inform the discussion in <strong>Between
State Capitalism and Globalisation</strong>. When discussing East German
workers in both <strong>Popular Protest</strong> and <strong>The East German
Revolution</strong> I think Dale might have moderated his comments about
&#8216;their substantial shop floor strength&#8217; had there been more
discussion of the similarities of the labour process east and west.
But these are matters for detailed discussion. What should stand out
for all of us is the overall achievement and challenge which Gareth
Dale has laid down.</p>
