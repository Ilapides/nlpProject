<p class="fst">Is the Cold War returning? Relations between Russia and the West
now are at their lowest point since the mid-1980s, and some in the
West are happy to interpret this as an impending return to the days
of the Cold War. Under Vladimir Putin Russia has begun to recover
from the low point of its &#8220;transition&#8221; in August 1998 when it
defaulted on its $40 billion debt and the rouble lost 60 percent of
its value in two months. Now, a decade on, some economic recovery has
helped to give a foundation to some political recovery. The fact that
Russia is a nuclear power with a permanent seat on the UN Security
Council means that Moscow&#8217;s concerns are magnified in the world
system and this creates difficulties and embarrassments for the
United States in particular. When in May 2006 Dick Cheney, the US
vice-president, denounced Russia&#8217;s use of oil and gas as &#8220;tools
of intimidation and blackmail&#8221;, Putin responded by denouncing the
US as &#8220;Comrade Wolf [who] knows whom to eat. He eats without
listening and he is clearly not going to listen to anyone.&#8221; <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p>Those who believe that the Cold War was a clash between
&#8220;capitalism&#8221; and &#8220;socialism&#8221; have little ability to explain
this new tension since on any account Russia and the US are now part
of the same system. Those who took a more sceptical view of the
argument that the Cold War was some clash between systems are in less
difficulty. Conflict is inherent in capitalism. The Cold War was not
so much a clash between &#8220;capitalism&#8221; and &#8220;socialism&#8221; as
between the globalising capitalism of the West and the more closed
&#8220;state capitalisms&#8221; of the East &#8211; a clash whose real nature was
disguised by the ideological claims of each side. The collapse of the
USSR therefore removed conflicts at some levels, but left those at
others untouched, and now, as before, Russia&#8217;s role in the global
system balances cooperation and tension.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Russian challenge?</h4>

<p class="fst">Three aspects of Russian policy today have aroused concern in the
West. The first is Russia&#8217;s reassertion of a degree of foreign
policy independence. The US has stumbled in Iraq and this has
provided a space for differences to be more openly expressed. A
Russian government document put it bluntly in April 2007: &#8220;The myth
about the unipolar world fell apart once and for all in Iraq ... A
strong, more self-confident Russia has become an integral part of
positive changes in the world.&#8221; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> The
argument was expressed more fully by President Putin at the Munich
Conference on Security Policy in February 2007. Here he was
sufficiently ill-mannered to state some fairly self-evident truths &#8211;
from referring to the &#8220;hundreds and thousands of civilians&#8221; being
killed in war today (in Iraq) to talking about the unequal trading
relationships the West continues to impose on the poor countries of
the world. But the centre of his attack was on the idea of a unipolar
world, dominated by the US, with:</p>

<p class="quoteb">one centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre
of decision making ... one master ... one sovereign ... today we are
witnessing an almost unconstrained use of force &#8211; military force
... one state and, of course, first and foremost the United States,
has overstepped the national borders in every way. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The second aspect of Russian policy to cause concern has been the
apparent deployment of its gas and oil power for economic and
political advantage &#8211; &#8221;geostrategic blackmail&#8221;. Notoriously in
January 2006 Russia temporarily cut off gas supplies to Ukraine; then
Belarus appeared to be threatened and later Lithuania. These local
actions threatened potential knock-on effects since 20 percent of
Russian gas to Central and Western Europe goes through Belarus and 80
percent through Ukraine. Central and Western Europe are now directly
dependent on Russian gas for 25 percent of their supplies, a figure
that is expected to rise to around a third in 2010 and, according to
some accounts, 70 percent by 2020. The idea that gas (and oil)
controlled by state-based companies such as Gazprom might be used in
a politically motivated way obviously raises concerns in Europe. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>The third element of concern about Russian policy has been the
reconsolidation of Russian state power and its deployment against
regime critics. Within Russia the Kremlin took on and jailed Russia&#8217;s
biggest oligarch, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and broke up his oil company,
Yukos. The main TV media are clearly under Kremlin control, as is
much of the formal political system. Beyond this, the finger of
suspicion has been raised as various critics of state policy,
corruption and criminalisation have died. Since 1993 over 150
journalists have been killed, for example. The most notorious
killing, in October 2006, was that of Anna Politkovskaya, the best
known journalist critic of Russia&#8217;s wars in Chechnya. Then in
November 2006 came the spectacular killing in London of the otherwise
minor figure of Alexander Litvinenko. How direct a role the Kremlin
had in this remains speculative but it has not stopped people
pointing the finger at the Putin regime.</p>

<p>But clashes of interest between states go beyond immediate
triggers. Putin&#8217;s sharp words against the US are designed to get
Russia a more prominent place at the high table, not to overturn it.
And we obviously also need to tackle Western complaints about Russia
with a pinch of salt, given the tendency of Western states also to
turn a blind eye to repression wherever it is in their interests. In
fact to understand what is happening we have to recognise the extent
to which international tensions are structured by the basic state
inequalities that exist in the global economy. The dominant player
here since 1945 has been the US. Even during the Cold War the USSR
struggled to challenge it, and once the USSR collapsed US power was
massively increased relative to other states. In the words of
Zbigniew Brzezinski, the US was now:</p>

<p class="quoteb">A power of unprecedented worldwide reach and grasp ...
America stands supreme in four distinctive domains of global power:
militarily, it has unmatched global reach; economically, it remains
the locomotive of global growth ... technologically, it retains the
overall lead in the cutting areas of innovation; and culturally,
despite some crassness, it enjoys an appeal that is unrivalled. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Today Russia&#8217;s policies reflect the interaction of internal and
external elements, but to make sense of it we need to start with the
external dimension and Russia&#8217;s changing reaction to the West&#8217;s
policies of the last decade and a half.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>American policy &#8211; pinning Russia back</h4>

<p class="fst">In the midst of another diplomatic spat in spring 2007 an
editorial in the <strong>Guardian</strong> claimed, &#8220;The West won the Cold
War and advanced eastwards in time honoured fashion&#8221;. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a>
Seen from Moscow this is the truth of what has happened since 1991.
The USSR broke up and Russia retreated, while the West in general and
the US in particular advanced to fill the vacuum. In his 2007 Munich
speech Putin quoted the words of a former Nato general secretary,
Manfred Werner, from 1990: &#8220;The fact that we are ready not to place
a Nato army outside of German territory gives the Soviet Union a firm
security guarantee.&#8221; Today it looks very different, claimed Putin:
&#8220;Nato has frontline forces on our borders.&#8221;</p>

<p>How should we explain the approach of the US and the West under
its leadership? As the debacle in Iraq grows, few are prepared to
defend the regime of George Bush, but blaming US policy on a
Washington leadership supported by neoconservatives is too
simplistic. Since the 1990s the US ruling class has held a shared
view that this has been the US&#8217;s moment, but it is a moment that
will not last and which must be maximised for its longer-term
advantage. In the more liberal version of this vision this requires
deployment of US soft power, a degree of self-sacrifice of immediate
US interests for longer-term goals and a sensitive leadership. For
the neocons the vision requires the deployment of hard power,
self-interest and tough leadership. But both approaches are rooted in
the same drive for global domination, and actual policy has involved
elements of both. For example, from the standpoint of Russia&#8217;s
leaders the recent Bush regime&#8217;s unilateralism only confirms
tendencies that go back to the Clinton era and beyond that to the
reign of George Bush Snr. The end of the Cold War was an opportunity
to really contain Russia, at best as a &#8220;normal country&#8221; &#8211; i.e.
a compliant and junior US client &#8211; at worst as a peripheral force.
In 1992 the <em>US Defence Planning Guidance</em> paper said that the US
should &#8220;account sufficiently for the interests of the advanced
nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership or seeking
to overturn the established economic and political order&#8221;. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p>So far as Russia was concerned this produced a delicate balancing
act. Some of the hard logic of this was spelled out at the time by
Brzezinski. The focus of US power had to be on Europe and Asia, what
he called, &#8220;the grand chessboard&#8221; and &#8220;the chief geopolitical
prize&#8221;. Here Russia&#8217;s size and position make it &#8220;a major
geo-strategic player, in spite of its weakened state and prolonged
malaise&#8221;. It was therefore necessary to undermine it, externally by
keeping the former Soviet bloc states beyond Moscow&#8217;s control, and
internally, by balancing a concern with Russia&#8217;s economic recovery
with the need to avoid strengthening Russia &#8220;politically and militarily&#8221;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">America thus faces a difficult dilemma regarding tactical
balance and strategic purpose. Internal Russian recovery is essential
to Russia&#8217;s democratisation and eventual Europeanisation. But any
recovery of its imperial potential would be inimical to both these objectives.</p>

<p class="fst">Today, like many others, Brzezinski suggests that the tactics of
Bush&#8217;s regime have weakened the US&#8217;s capacity to achieve its
strategic objectives. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> But we should
not let this argument detract from recognising the wider assumptions
of an imperial strategic purpose. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>
Equally the fact that the decisions made by the US sometimes reflect
problems and opportunities not of its making (for example, the
alacrity with which the former Central European states have turned to
the West) should not distract us from also recognising that US policy
has sought to use events for its own narrower ends.</p>

<p>US policy has produced many areas of friction with Russia but here
we will mention four issues. The first has been US determination to
push its global military dominance. This has partly been done by its
support of the &#8220;son of Star Wars&#8221; project which has led it to
unilaterally abrogate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty (one of
the prizes of Cold War diplomacy) and to now threaten to locate
(albeit encouraged by compliant local governments) radar bases in
Poland and the Czech Republic. This system is supposed to be directed
against rogue states but it only makes sense (if it makes sense!) if
the threat is Russia. But American military dominance has also been
reflected, from Moscow&#8217;s point of view, by US actions in Bosnia and
Kosovo, Afghanistan and now Iraq.</p>

<p>The second tension arises from the way that the US has encouraged
first the former Soviet bloc states of Central Europe and then the
successor states of the USSR to link into the West, while seemingly
excluding Russia. While Russian leaders expected states in its former
sphere of influence to be integrated economically with the West, at
one stage they naively believed this would not be accompanied by
military and geo-political integration. In fact it was led by this,
with Nato membership preceding the expansion of the European Union.
In July 2006 Putin pointed out, &#8220;There is no more Warsaw Pact, no
more Soviet Union, but Nato continues to exist and develop&#8221;. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>
This is not simply an issue to the west and south of Moscow. To the
east the US continues to help Japan modernise its military with half
an eye on China and half on Russia. Western officials portray this in
the most benign light, but a more cynical view might suggest that the
wildest encirclement ideas of the Cold War hawks in Washington are
being realised while many of the darkest nightmares of Russian Cold
War warriors in Moscow are coming true.</p>

<p>A third tension is competition over oil and energy. While any
deployment of energy power by Russia is seen as illegitimate, the US
is determined to maintain its supplies of cheap oil by whatever
economic, political and military actions are necessary. As George
Bush Snr infamously put it in 1992, &#8220;The American way of life is
not negotiable.&#8221; Oil and energy pipeline issues have therefore
become mixed up with US policies around the globe, and not least in
Iraq. The result is not merely distrust of Russian energy power but
its sidelining in areas where Moscow feels it might have legitimate interests.</p>

<p>Finally, we should also note the aggravation of a fourth element &#8211;
the imperial arrogance of US policy. Beggars cannot be choosers. The
US does not have therefore even to make minor accommodations. Trivial
in itself but telling symbolically has been the US tardiness in
dealing with relics of the Cold War such as the 1974 Jackson-Vanek
amendment which treated the USSR/Russia as an economic pariah state.
During the Cold War US policymakers had to disguise their real
designs to some degree in order to win hearts and minds. The real
dynamics of US policy were therefore often set out in
semi-confidential and confidential documents, hinted at and alluded
to. Today they are discussed openly. Not everybody is prepared to
grit their teeth and accept this. Russia&#8217;s leaders believe they
should also be accorded a degree of respect. As one Western diplomat
said at the time of the St Petersburg G8 summit in 2006, they have
all &#8220;the right suits, watches and the right cars&#8221;. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p>In making these points we are not trying to justify the Putin
regime or defend &#8220;a lesser imperial power&#8221; against a &#8220;major
imperial power&#8221;. This is not the issue. Rather our point is that
Western commentators and politicians who claim that Western policy is
benign and Russia&#8217;s response paranoid need to be more realistic. Of
course there is self-interest and arrogance in Russia&#8217;s own
position (not least in its failure to understand the grievances of
the states that it formerly ruled). There is also an element of play
acting and a degree of paranoia too. But, as the saying goes, just
because you are paranoid it doesn&#8217;t mean that they are not out to
get you.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The fall of Russia</h4>

<p class="fst">Russia hit rock bottom both internally and externally in the
crisis of the summer of 1998. It had lost its Eastern European empire
in 1989. Then in 1991 the Soviet Union was broken up, leaving Russia
the largest fragment with 148 million out of its population of 288
million. Economic output fell by 45 percent during the transition to
market capitalism &#8211; a virtually unique peacetime collapse. And in
1998, as the rouble crashed, it all seemed for nothing. The mass of
the population suffered enormously in a social catastrophe. Male life
expectancy fell from 64.2 years in 1989 to 57.6 in 1994 (female life
expectancy fell by 3.3 years in the same period). The birth rate fell
from 13.4 (per thousand individuals per year) in 1990 to a low of 8.3
in 1999; the death rate rose from 11.2 in 1990 to a peak of 16.4 in
2003. Russia&#8217;s total population would have fallen more had it not
been for migration from the &#8220;near abroad&#8221; of the former states of
the USSR of 2.5 million people pushed out by equal penury and fear of
anti-Russian moods. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>But in the process there were winners as well as losers. The
Russian ruling class was restructured in no small part through
grabbing the state property that it once managed. This involved three
stages. The first was the spontaneous &#8220;nomenklatura privatisation&#8221;
of 1989&#8211;92 when, as one Russian put it, many of those managing
resources pursued the smell of property like a beast after prey.
Formal privatisation took place in the 1992&#8211;5 period in what was,
in effect, a further managerial buy out. The third stage was when
Boris Yeltsin exchanged key state holdings for financial support &#8211;
a set of deals that consolidated and increased the holdings of the
so-called oligarchs. The aim of those at the top was to convert their
de facto control of state property into de jure (legal) control of it
as private property and in the process to plunder it as much as
possible. Investment all but collapsed, falling to about 20 percent
of the levels of a decade earlier. Inequality grew dramatically. On
the basis of the <em>2004 <strong>Forbes</strong> Rich List</em> it
has been calculated that, while the wealth of US billionaires was
equivalent to some 7 percent of output, the wealth controlled by the
then 26 Russian billionaires was 19 percent of Russian output. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a>
Some of the new wealth was spent ostentatiously in Russia but much of
it was carried abroad. Often money was laundered through the
financial system in what economists call &#8220;capital flight&#8221; but
some of it taken out in cruder forms: &#8220;I saw people with suitcases
stuffed with money,&#8221; said one of the people who helped some of this
cash re-emerge in London. &#8220;It was a fallout from what was sweeping
Russia at the time; it was the Wild West. Much of the money had been
made in state sell-offs and it seemed with every new convulsion
there, a new wave of exiles arrived.&#8221; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>The paradox of the transition and the Yeltsin era was its
combination of continuity and instability. Key state institutions
survived &#8211; the bureaucracy, the military, the secret police, etc.
Many of the new players turned out to be the old ones, or their
children or acolytes. But the structures of power were weakened as
insiders and opportunists seized their chance. What in Russia are
called the &#8220;verticals&#8221; of power &#8211; the links between the top and
bottom of society, and the links between the centre and the regions,
were thrown into disarray. Some thought this would last forever.
Boris Berezovsky suggested that 50 percent of the economy was
controlled by seven oligarchs and Mikhail Khodorkovsky said,
&#8220;Politics is the most lucrative field of business in Russia. And it
will be this way forever.&#8221; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p>This plunder weakened Russia within and without to such a degree
that even members of the ruling class began to see that some greater
degree of order was necessary lest Russia become a &#8220;failed state&#8221;.
The problem was whether things could begin to be put back together.
When power formally passed to Putin at the turn of 2000 it was not
obvious that they could. How has he managed to be more successful
than many anticipated?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The recovery of Russian economic and state power?</h4>

<p class="fst">In March 1999 the <strong>Economist</strong> magazine made a spectacularly
bad prediction: &#8220;The world is awash with oil and likely to remain
so&#8221;, oil was selling at $10 a barrel and might fall to $5, but
&#8220;basket cases&#8221; such as Russia and Nigeria would have to sell it
whatever the price, and so endure &#8220;huge budget and current account
deficits&#8221;. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> Today, of course, oil
economies are awash with cash. By 2002 oil prices were in the range
of $22 to $28 a barrel, and by mid-2006 they had hit $75 a barrel.
This windfall came courtesy of George Bush and the war in Iraq.</p>

<p>Since 1998 Russia has grown at around 6 to 7 percent a year on
average. Today it is near to exceeding its 1991 levels of per capita
output, albeit with a very different income distribution. The decade
and a half of lost growth appears to have come to an end. Inevitably
economists debate the explanation for this turnaround. One factor is
that the 1998 collapse made imports much more expensive, providing
some space for Russian production to expand. The question is the
balance between any internal recovery and the oil windfall. For
Russia&#8217;s leaders, as well as those who supported the market
transition, it is important that the state that they head be
something more than an &#8220;energy superpower&#8221;, that something more
has been achieved than simply turning the country from what cynics
used to call &#8220;Upper Volta with rockets&#8221; to &#8220;Upper Volta with
oil wells (and a few rockets)&#8221;. And it is true that as growth
continues its base must widen. But taking all this into account (and
allowing for a whole series of technical issues about how to deal
with the continuing distortions in the measurement of output) it is
difficult to escape the conclusion that energy exports have been and
remain at the core of Russia&#8217;s recovery.</p>

<p>One OECD economist talks of &#8220;the staggering extent to which
recent growth has been driven by the expansion of output and exports
of the national resource sector, and especially by ... Russian oil
companies&#8221;. This resource sector also includes steel, aluminium,
nickel and fertiliser. But beyond it, however, &#8220;Russian industry is
still unable to compete with imports of many sought after consumer
goods&#8221;. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a> Indeed this dependence
produces the fear that Russian industry will remain weakly
competitive because energy sales help to keep the value of the rouble
high and therefore weaken competitiveness (what economists refer to
as the &#8220;Dutch disease&#8221; said to particularly characterise oil economies).</p>

<p>The data in <a href="#t4">tables 4</a> and <a href="#t5">5</a> in the appendix to this article show
the unbalanced distribution of gas and oil reserves and production in
relation to global demand. Currently Russia is the world&#8217;s second
largest oil exporter. In 2004, for example, energy exports made up 55
percent of total exports with metals a further 14 percent. Machinery
and equipment were only 7 percent. <a href="#t1">Table 1</a>, however, shows that the
actual production of gas and oil is not as impressive as it has been
in the past, despite their central role in the internal and external
economy. Resource-rich regions, as well as Moscow and St Petersburg,
have benefited disproportionately from Russia&#8217;s extractive
recovery. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Putin regime has been able to use this energy driven recovery
to create a degree of order within Russia, imposing what is
euphemistically called &#8220;a managed democracy&#8221;. In doing this Putin
has often moved cautiously. Even if his ultimate destination has been
a strong Russian state, Putin&#8217;s policies seem designed to build on,
rather than call into question, the post-Soviet settlement. Several
elements of this are important.</p>

<p>The first is the relation of the Putin regime to Russia&#8217;s
business class. This is the subject of some controversy. Is the
regime the friend or foe of Russian business? To what extent is
business colonising the state or is the state colonising business?
While some commentators see the Putin regime as a threat to business
and, through this, to a continued market transition, others see it as
their guarantor. Similarly, while some are struck by the role of
political appointees and members of the former security forces at the
top of Russian companies, others are struck by the direct access that
business has to the state. It is important not to overestimate the
strength of the Russian state and the political regime. If much
business is dependent on the state, so is the state dependent on business.</p>

<p>There is no contradiction between a degree of state recovery and
the broader interests of those who control the Russian economy. As
Thompson, another OECD economist, has put it, &#8220;For Russia&#8217;s new
rich, state-building and structural reform were intended to
consolidate the victories they had won in the 1990s&#8221;. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a>
One aspect of this is the deal Putin supposedly struck with 21
representatives of big business in July 2000. What happened is not
known precisely, but the popular account is that Putin agreed to
leave the changes of the 1990s untouched provided business leaders in
turn supported the state and his regime and did not make political
capital against him. This seems to be more or less what has happened.</p>

<p>The evidence against this is the fate of some of the biggest
oligarchs of the Yeltsin era. Boris Berezovsky has been given
political asylum in the UK, Vladimir Gusinsky lives in the US and
Israel, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky &#8211; Russia&#8217;s biggest new
capitalist &#8211; is in jail for tax fraud and his company, Yukos,
effectively renationalised. These are spectacular cases but in each
instance these oligarchs appeared as potential centres of open
opposition to Putin. Beyond them, however, the pillaging of the 1990s
produced a super-rich elite with over 50 dollar billionaires and some
100,000 dollar millionaires. While many ordinary Russians would like
to see these join Khodorkovsky, Putin has shown no sign of wanting
this. The security origins of some of the power brokers today &#8211; the
so-called silovki &#8211; reflects the clannish nature of the Putin
regime and the continuity of the KGB-FSB (the federal security
service) nexus. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a> But, compared to
Yeltsin&#8217;s clique, known as &#8220;the family&#8221;, Putin&#8217;s seems to
have a broader base. Certainly there is a concern with &#8220;our
people&#8221;. Andrei Illarionov, an adviser who fell out with Putin,
talks of &#8220;an ideology of &#8216;nash-ism&#8217; (our people) offering
privileges, subsidies, credits, power and authority to those who are
nashy (ours)&#8221;. But significantly some now refer to those at the top
who are &#8220;our people&#8221; not as a &#8220;family&#8221; but as a
&#8220;corporation&#8221;. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p>As one Russian commentator puts it, today Russia is a country
where &#8220;interests reign supreme&#8221; and especially financial interests:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Private and corporate interests are behind most of
Moscow&#8217;s major policy decisions as Russia is ruled by people who
largely own it ... Under President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s watch the
Russian state has turned into something like Russia Inc with top
Kremlin staffers and senior ministers sitting on the boards of
various state-owned corporations and taking an active interest in
their progress and profits. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A second crucial aspect of the Putin regime has been the
successful attempt to regain control over Russia&#8217;s resources (and
some production) through the development of state and semi-state
companies. The natural gas monopoly Gazprom and Rosneft, which now
controls some 55 percent of Russian crude oil output, are the leading
examples. Khodorkovsky&#8217;s Yukos was, by a circuitous route, taken
over by Rosneft. BP has been forced to retreat in its Anglo-Russian
joint ventures and Shell has been squeezed in the giant Sakhaklin-2
gas project in the Far East. The giant Russian companies that control
decisive sectors of the Russian economy are certainly examples of
&#8220;state capitals&#8221; but they are no longer insular as their
acquisitions abroad and their appearance in the world financial
markets (not least London) shows. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a>
As Dmitri Trenin has put it, those in control want geo-economic power
as much as geo-political &#8211; &#8221;they plan to build Russia as a great
power with a global reach, organised as a super-corporation&#8221;. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p>The third element of Putin&#8217;s emerging policy has been to try to
restore some coherence to the Russian state, to restore some of the
&#8220;verticals&#8221;. This has involved trying to smash separatism, most
notably in the bloody war in Chechnya. It has also involved trying to
re-establish clear links between the centre and Russia&#8217;s 89
regions. In particular Putin used his powers in 2004 to impose the
appointment rather than election of regional governors. It has also
involved trying to re-establish a degree of state bureaucratic
competence and not least to restore the tax base. Again, however,
there has also been caution. Rich Russians are expected to pay their
taxes but they are rewarded with a flat rate income tax of 13
percent. The regional governors are expected to give Putin his due
but in turn the overwhelming No.&nbsp; of old ones were reappointed.</p>

<p>The fourth direction of state policy has been to try to capture
some of the gains from the economic recovery and the oil windfall. A
state stabilisation fund was created &#8211; effectively a financial
insurance fund to sustain the state budget for three years if oil
prices fall by a half and tax revenues drop. Beyond this, as average
real wages have risen sharply from the dangerously depressed levels
of the 1990s, a more modest attempt has been made to deal with the
extreme poverty of pensioners and lower level state employees, who
experienced some of the hardest conditions in the transition. Again
there is caution. The stabilisation fund has so far had a financial
focus neglecting what the OECD calls &#8220;income generating&#8221;
components. Poverty has fallen but it is still widespread and the
class and regional gaps are huge. By value, for example, four
provinces &#8211; Moscow, Moscow Region, St Petersburg and the oil rich
Siberian province of Tyumen &#8211; are responsible for more than half of
all output. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p>Finally the Putin regime has tightened control of the political
system. The elections of December 2007 are already stitched up. No
one doubts that, barring something completely unforeseen, they will
produce a compliant Duma. This is because in 2004 Putin changed the
electoral system to weaken potential opposition. Formal politics has
taken on a virtual character as pseudo parties have been created and
manipulated and the TV media in particular controlled. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a>
The big question now is over the March 2008 presidential elections.
Under the constitution Putin cannot serve a third term but he now has
the power to alter the constitution if he wants and enough control of
public support to do it. He insists he will not. If he maintains this
position power will pass to his anointed successor. Putin could then
return in 2012 while retaining a key position or he could even (it
seems unlikely) risk retirement. In one sense, however, his decision
is a lesser issue. Whether Putin stays, goes, or steps back, Putinism
&#8211; the emerging logic of a strengthened internal and external
system, based on a &#8220;managed democracy&#8221; &#8211; will continue so long
as the conditions which allow it continue.</p>

<p>It is this recovery that has also allowed Russia to be less
compliant externally. Putin can now appear as the defender of the
&#8220;Russian nation&#8221;, the leader of a power which, whatever its
immediate difficulties, might have a brighter future. This means that
Russia&#8217;s leaders can now try to get back some at least of the power
that was humiliatingly lost in the 1990s, and that they can do so on
the basis of a new realism about the &#8220;benign&#8221; intentions of the
West. This, from their point of view, does not mean a return to an
old style Cold War. Russian capital, however ill-gained, has begun to
flow abroad and with it many Russians, including its ruling class who
fly backwards and forwards to the best resorts, hotels, second homes,
luxury shops and so on. They do not want the old days. But it does
mean that they look forward to Russian capital having some leverage
in the global economy and to the Russian state being a player in a
&#8220;multipolar&#8221; world. The idea of a straightforward US-Russian
alliance, which briefly flickered in the 1990s, has been abandoned.
So too has Gorbachev&#8217;s idea that Russia would be allowed to fit
easily into &#8220;a common European home&#8221;. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p>But there is an enormous amount of pragmatism in Russia&#8217;s
position. There has to be. Its leaders need to maximise their
advantages from a position that is still weak. This means putting
pressure on the near abroad and countries such as Georgia and Ukraine
to warn them of the costs of moving too close to the US. It also
means trying to divide its bigger competitors to weaken their
resolve. This is one reason for the bilateral energy deals with
different European countries. It also lies behind the cultivation of
closer relations with some countries than others. The contradictions
of Russia&#8217;s relationship with Britain show the problems for Moscow.
Politically the London-Washington link is so strong that Britain
appears as a political problem for Moscow. But the UK also operates
as an open door to the global economy. Lax City regulations allow
Russian companies to float in London. Money is laundered there,
football clubs are bought and the Russian rich find a welcome in
&#8220;little Moscow on the Thames&#8221;. There has, therefore, to be a
carefully modulated rhetoric globally &#8211; trying to turn the West&#8217;s
own rhetoric against itself, pushing but pushing not too far in order
to balance integration into and a degree of independence within the
global economy.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Still a weak hand?</h4>

<p class="fst">The US wants a unipolar world. Moscow wants a multipolar one. But
neither can have what they want. <a href="#t2">Tables 2</a> and <a href="#t3">3</a> show the key elements
of the balance of power. The US is the dominant player but Iraq has
exposed that its reach has limits. Russia on the other hand, thanks
to its geography which still stretches across 11 time zones, remains
a player but still a weak one compared to both the old USSR and other
states today. The Russian defence budget is due to rise, but even so
it is still only running at around 5 percent of the US budget, as
Putin has acknowledged. Thus when Putin responded to US pressure
first by threatening to retarget Russian missiles and then, in July
2007, suspending Russia&#8217;s obligations under the conventional forces
in Europe treaty these gestures had a big element of posture
politics.</p>

<p class="fst">If Russia continues to grow this gap will diminish somewhat
(though it should be remembered that Russia is still not at the
relative position it was in 1989). But even if the rebound is strong
and sustained the gap will remain enormous. Economically Russia now
appears a second division economy. The difficulty for the Russian
regime is that growth will not continue indefinitely at the high
rates of the past years. Some of the causes of the current high price
of oil are structural. Others reflect the situation in Iraq. Oil
prices always fluctuate and when they go down they will test how
diversified the Russian economy has become. From the time of Brezhnev
to Gorbachev the USSR was condemned for underpinning living standards
through exports of raw materials, especially oil, and failing to
build a competitive industrial (or service) base. Today the situation
of Russia is, it seems, little different. Russia&#8217;s oil and gas
wealth is produced by around a mere 3 percent of the work force. No
economy with a population the size of Russia has been able to
generalise wealth on the basis of energy and raw material exports
(Saudi Arabia&#8217;s population, for example, is one seventh that of
Russia).</p>

<p class="fst">One reason for scepticism regarding Russia&#8217;s economic prospects
is that investment, while rising too, still remains too low,
especially in agriculture and manufacturing. If average consumption
is now greater than in 1989 (but distributed differently) investment
is still well under half the 1989 level. Even in the oil and gas
sectors there are huge problems because of the backwardness of the
technology. In gas production Rudiger Ahrend, an OECD economist,
calls the situation &#8220;dire&#8221;. The basis for continued improvement
is what the 2006 OECD report on Russia calls &#8220;a pattern of
self-sustaining investment driven growth that can be maintained over
the long-run&#8221;. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a> Yet key sections
of the ruling class still see their future in terms of organised
plunder. The former chess champion and now Putin opponent Garry
Kasparov, despite his own political weaknesses, makes a valid point
when he says, &#8220;It&#8217;s not like America in the 19th century.
Carnegie, Morgan, Rockefeller, they built something new. These
people, they were just in the right place when the national wealth
was being distributed&#8221;. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a>
Building, therefore, is hardly central to their nature.</p>

<p>The continuing tendency to withdraw profits is both cause and
consequence of the fact that although some order has been restored
there still remains massive inefficiency, corruption and
criminalisation. Indeed some claim that the level of state corruption
is significantly higher than under Yeltsin. In 2006 Transparency
International, the pro-market and anti-corruption NGO, put Russia
126th out of 159 states in its corruption index. In June 2006 Putin
seemed to admit to continued problems when he sacked the Russian
procurator general, in part for failing to deal with corruption. In
November 2006 the deputy prosecutor general estimated that bribes to
state officials might amount to an extraordinary &#163;125 billion. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p>Nor is it just a question of low physical investment. Although the
OECD still talks of the value of Russia&#8217;s educational base, its
social infrastructure in general has suffered enormously in the last
two decades. Even in oil and gas Putin was driven to ask in 2003,
&#8220;What is the good of having oil and metal if we do not have the
know-how to extract them? ... We keep importing workers from Europe,
as if we did not have our own system for training them in this
country&#8221;. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> The idea that Russia
can sustain an innovation boom to growth looks highly questionable.</p>

<p>The Putin regime combines a far from unique authoritarianism and
centralisation of state power in some areas with neoliberalism in
others. If the main ownership structures are now established, this
does not mean that there is not a space and need for further
restructuring, and this will be painful if subsidies and protection
are withdrawn. In the Soviet era certain forms of state provision
were subsidised to buy social peace. Now internal customers are also
being asked to pay more. The state continues to have neoliberal
welfare reform on the agenda, which means effectively solving the
education and health care crisis by increasing prices. Thus even as
the standard of living rises for some, the state is risking a
confrontation. Moreover, even if expression of it is being squeezed
out of the formal political system, there is still much public
bitterness alongside support for the general goals of the Putin
regime. One independent MP (who will probably not survive the
December 2007 elections) told Western reporters that &#8220;Putin&#8217;s
system is a petro-state where a small group have monopolised
resources and divided them between the political class, state
bureaucrats and managers. A couple of million live well, while the
majority are poor&#8221;. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a> This sense
of division regularly comes through in opinion polls.</p>

<p>But sustained opposition is hard. This is only in part because of
the authoritarian and oppressive nature of the regime. The
manipulation of formal parties to create psuedo movements certainly
sows confusion. To derail the nationalist Communist Party the Kremlin
sponsored the creation of the nationalist Rodina party. To prevent a
youth revolt it sponsored the right wing Nashi youth movement.
Similarly repression, though mild in comparison to some countries, is
periodically turned against embryonic movements from below. But a
bigger problem is continuing disorientation, demoralisation and
depoliticisation in Russia.</p>

<p>The heyday of a popular movement for change in Russia was probably
the brief flowering of 1989&#8211;90. Thereafter people&#8217;s lives were
ripped apart to a degree that is hard for us to imagine. While a few
made good, others became more nihilistic and the majority turned in
on themselves. Defensive struggles were sometimes sharp but many
ordinary Russians simply struggled to survive. The most glaring sign
of this is the problem of what two demographers have called &#8220;the
Russian cross&#8221; &#8211; the cross on the demographic graph between the
rising death rate and the falling birth rate. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a>
The gap between them is still huge. Demographic projections are
notoriously unreliable but non-current trends see Russia&#8217;s
population falling from over 140 million today to 100 million in
2050. One major reason for this is the huge rise in alcohol
consumption, as a generation of Russian men drown their sorrows and
death ends their lives prematurely. Russia now has 2.3 million
official alcoholics.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, resentment periodically breaks out. Whatever support
Putin commands as an individual there is still widespread concern at
the situation he has ruled over. People feel the injustices of their
situation &#8211; the inequalities and flaunted wealth, the corruption
and crime &#8211; despite the uneven improvement. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a>
And economic recovery occasionally allows for some demands to be made
in a slightly more positive frame of mind &#8211; employers can also
grant wage increases to avert trouble. In 2003, for example, there
were only 67 strikes officially recorded in Russia. These figures
underestimate small day-to-day acts of resistance, which have been
commonplace. But in 2004-5 there was a mini strike wave, though the
strikes were almost all small. In 2006 officially recorded strikes
all but disappeared, but wages continued to rise. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a>
There have also been continuing demonstrations, especially against
reforms that affect jobs and welfare. From the point of view of the
Putin regime these are little more than minor irritants, but just as
we have suggested that at the top there has been less consolidation
than some suggest, so the same is true at the bottom.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f3" name="n3">3.</a> Quoted from the official
translation on the Russian president&#8217;s website.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f4" name="n4">4.</a> Gazprom, under majority state
ownership and formally headed by first deputy prime minister Dimitry
Medvedev, sits on the largest reserves of natural gas in the world
and -controls the third largest oil and gas energy base after Saudi
Arabia and Iran.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f8" name="n8">8.</a> Brzezinski, 2005.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f9" name="n9">9.</a> A different US leadership might
have handled things with more sophistication than the George Bush
regime but a so-called realist analysis rather than a neoconservative
one still recognises the inevitability of clashes of interest.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f10" name="n10">10.</a> Quoted in the <strong>Guardian</strong>, 5

a positive spin) on regional inequality see World Bank, 2007.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f22" name="n22">22.</a> Trenin, 2006, pp95-96. In this,
of course, Russia is less different from the US and UK than many make
out. Here, however, the corporate state hides behind a façade,
albeit weakening, that does not exist in Russia.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f23" name="n23">23.</a> Trenin, 2006, p96. Discussing
the squeeze on Western companies, Daniel Yergin writes that &#8220;this
is an era in which power has shifted toward state companies and the
questions -international oil companies are facing in Russia are
similar to the access questions they are facing elsewhere&#8221; &#8211; <strong>The
Financial Times</strong>, 20 April 2007.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f24" name="n24">24.</a> Gazprom&#8217;s self-declared
mission is &#8220;the strategic objective of becoming a global energy
leader&#8221;, quoted in the <strong>Guardian</strong>, 12 April 2007.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f25" name="n25">25.</a> Wood, 2007.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f26" name="n26">26.</a> There are now four main
parties/groups in the Duma &#8211; United Russia, A Just Russia, the
Communists, and the Nationalists. As a result of the 2004 changes
parties must have a minimum of 50,000 members spread over at least
half of Russia&#8217;s provinces; a list system is used, so reducing the
role of independents. The minimum vote needed for Duma representation
was increased from 5 to 7 percent and the minimum 25 percent turnout
was removed.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f27" name="n27">27.</a> See Lavrov, 2007, for an
official statement of the Russian leadership&#8217;s view of Russia&#8217;s
global role. This is the text of the Russian foreign minister&#8217;s
article for the US journal Foreign Affairs which was withdrawn in
disputed circumstances.</p>
