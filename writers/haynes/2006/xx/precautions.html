<p class="fst">What is to be done about global warming? The greenhouse effect is
caused by our pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when we burn
carbon-based fuels like coal, gas and oil. The atmosphere acts like
greenhouse glass, trapping the heat we need to survive. But when the
greenhouse becomes too hot, disaster beckons.</p>

<p>It is the advanced world that causes most of the problems and it
is the poor world that suffers most as the number of &#8216;ecological
refugees&#8217; rises. Andrew Simms&#8217; <strong>Ecological Debt</strong> offers a
vivid description of how this happens. The advanced capitalist states
have plundered the world and continue to trap poor countries in a
network of economic debt. But in any ecological accounting the debt
would be the other way. The few owe the many because of their
disproportionate use of resources and the disproportionate pollution
that they cause. This is getting worse as competition for resources
and energy grows. Two thirds of the anticipated increasing demand for
oil in the next two decades will have to come from the Middle East,
for example. This may not be the only reason for the US presence in
Iraq but it is a powerful contributing factor.</p>

<p>Simms rejects the idea that capitalism has a self-correcting
economic mechanism. Some claim that when prices rise the system will
adjust and reduce the burden on the environment. For Simms, any such
price signals would be too slow and distorted by dirty subsidies.
They would also require unrealistic increases in technological
efficiency. Inevitably the costs would again fall more on the poor.
So far so good. Simms&#8217; account echoes what some on the left have
argued. In two articles in the <strong>Journal of Economic</strong> (Issues
34&nbsp;(3), September 2000 and 37&nbsp;(3), September 2003), for
example, Rumy Husan and I have argued that even if the market
argument worked (we don&#8217;t think it does), then it could only
equalise global incomes over huge time periods and with unsustainable
environmental costs.</p>

<p>Is there an alternative? Simms suggests that if nothing changes
the result will be chaos. Only a reduction and redistribution of
resources makes any sense. This is what, following Aubrey Meyer,
Simms calls &#8216;contraction and convergence&#8217;. I would prefer to talk
of restructuring, redistribution and convergence. But the key issue
is, can we get either inside the system?</p>

<p>Simms&#8217; answer is by far the weakest part of this book. He veers
towards the apocalyptic at one point, suggesting that &#8216;global
warming probably means the death of capitalism as the dominant
organising framework for the global economy&#8217;. Yet much of the
second half of the book is taken up with the idea that the
international legal system can be used to control and moderate
capitalism. Simms never seriously considers the limits to the law at
the national level, let alone the international level. Nor does he
ask who will enforce it.</p>

<p>To have an illusion in the law is also to have an illusion in the
state and the ability of states to work together. In <strong>Between Equal
Rights</strong> (reviewed in <strong>International Socialism 2&nbsp;:&nbsp;107</strong>),
China Mi&#233;ville has shown in terms of legal theory why international
law cannot work in the way that its supporters hope. But even without
this we might have hoped for a more sceptical position from an
environmentalist like Simms. He uses the idea that the law needs to
control the &#8216;global commons&#8217; &#8211; the common land, atmosphere,
etc., that we all share. But in England it was the rich who took the
original common land from the people using the law and state
together. Legal challenges have a place, but by themselves they are
not enough and to the extent that they are effective they owe as much
to the sound of noisy opposition beyond the courtroom walls as to
&#8216;legalistic thinking&#8217; inside.</p>

<p>Such arguments underpin Steven P. McGiffen&#8217;s <strong>Biotechnology:
Corporate Power Versus Public Interest</strong>. McGiffen reviews the
legal basis of the control of Genetically Modified Organisms across
the developed world, in the developing world and through
international treaties. Whereas Simms&#8217; writing is light, McGiffen&#8217;s
is dense. But he is the more realistic about what law and regulation
can do. Corporate power, he argues, likes legal protection for some
things &#8211; patents, for example, or forcing farmers to keep buying
seeds from the company store. Corporate power dislikes regulations
which conflict with its basic drive for profit and attempts to
commodify increasing areas of life across the globe.</p>

<p>This undermines the possibility of the &#8216;precautionary approach&#8217;
whether it be to climate change or GM farming. The &#8216;precautionary
approach&#8217; is the argument that, since we cannot know exactly what
climate change or genetic modification will bring but we suspect that
any negative changes might be irreversible or only reversible over
generations, we should err on the side of caution. In contrast,
McGiffen argues that corporate power has no interest in a &#8216;measured
and considered&#8217; debate or measured regulation. Both are subject to
&#8216;the ferocious, self-interested lobbying of multinational
corporations with a stake in biotechnology&#8217;.</p>

<p>This is justified by a GM science that makes vastly inflated
claims. Companies prevent or denigrate independent tests.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting facets of global capitalism at the
moment is the huge power of agribusiness. Hundreds of millions of
people produce the food that feeds billions, but if it enters into
the global economy then this food is funnelled through a tiny number
of multinational companies. Ten pesticide companies, for example,
control 84 percent of the global pesticide market and five of these
(Du Pont, Syngenta, Bayer, Monsanto and Dow) control 25 percent of
the commercial seed market as well. These same five companies control
71 percent of patents of agricultural biotechnology.</p>

<p>The problem is how to go beyond this situation. McGiffen argues
that &#8216;under pressure from a public increasingly aware of problems
associated with biotech&#8217; in some places the law and elected
representatives have gone some way to creating some controls. But
elsewhere those who try to regulate the system &#8216;have become nothing
more than builders of the road along which the juggernaut of
corporate-controlled biotechnology is moving, and crushing all that
stands in its way&#8217;.</p>
