<p class="fst">David Harvey<br/>
<strong>A Brief History of Neo-Liberalism</strong><br/>
<em>Oxford University Press, 2005, &#163;14.99</em></p>

<p>David Harvey, the leading Marxist geographer, manages to cram a
lot into this brief history of the renaissance of free market
capitalism in the guise of neoliberalism. He wants to explain how,
from New York, to Europe, to China, key figures like &#8216;Volcker,
Reagan, Thatcher, and Den Xiaoping all took minority [neo-liberal]
arguments that had long been in circulation and made them ... the
central guiding principle of economic thought and management&#8217;.</p>

<p>This shift did not happen automatically. Neo-liberalism triumphed
in the 1990s after &#8216;a series of gyrations and experiments&#8217;. Its
success, Harvey argues, reflected two main things. One was pressure
on profits in global capitalism. The other was the determination of
the ruling class to find a solution that would remould the world in
their favour.</p>

<p>The bluntness, even crudeness, of this second argument will shock
some, especially as Harvey has not been afraid in the past to argue
for more complexity rather than less. Now he argues that the paradox
of the last two decades has been that while the left has been
agonising about the disappearance of class, our rulers have been
pursuing a project which has aimed to consolidate their political
power and to secure an astonishing redistribution of wealth in their
favour. &#8216;If it looks like class struggle and acts like class war,&#8217;
writes Harvey, &#8216;then we have to name it for what it is&#8217; (p.&nbsp;202).</p>

<p>Seemingly more sophisticated accounts cannot grasp this central
element of neoliberalism. The philosopher John Grey, for example,
presents neo-liberalism as an intellectual conceit, a genuinely
utopian project, which is bound to fail, as 19th century free market
liberalism did before it, when it encounters the real world. Joseph
Stiglitz, on the other hand, treats neo-liberalism as an intellectual
error. While the best economic theorists have been showing the limits
of the market, market populists have mistakenly stripped away any
qualifications from public debate and policy.</p>

<p>For Harvey, accounts like this fail to focus on the way in which
self-interest has been at the heart of the neo-liberal project. The
wider political system has been deliberately manipulated through the
strategic intervention of think tanks, pressure groups, lobbying and
the like, and behind all this have stood ruling classes intent on
strengthening their power. The left too, in not wanting to appear
unsophisticated, has missed the obvious. Neo-liberalism as a project
for raising the rate of global growth, reducing inequality, widening
freedom has consistently failed. But this was never its real object.
At first more or less intuitively and semi-consciously, but then more
openly, neo-liberalism has secured its main object: &#8216;to
redistribute, rather than generate, wealth and income&#8217;. This was
not, as writers like Grey or Stiglitz might argue, an unfortunate
by-product of theoretical failings &#8211; it was the main agenda all
along.</p>

<p>I have much sympathy with this view. The audacity of the changes
of the last two decades is so great that it is intimidating. However,
as the contours of the changes become clearer so does the centrality
of the concentration of global power and wealth. Although Harvey adds
many nuances &#8211; discussing how the ruling class itself has been
remoulded, the uneven spread of neo-liberalism, its Chinese
manifestation and so on &#8211; the central demand that one should judge
neo-liberalism by what it has done and see this as the object all
along makes considerable sense. Indeed it might be possible to go
even further and to supplement Harvey&#8217;s class account with a more
particular corruption theory of privatisation &#8211; seeing its real
object as providing legal ways through which the state could be
milked for the individual benefit of members of the ruling class. At
the turn of the 19th century the state was a huge redistributive
mechanism which took from the poor to give to the rich &#8211; they it
called &#8216;old corruption&#8217; at the time. In many countries a similar
mechanism of &#8216;new corruption&#8217; has been created for the turn of
the 21st century.</p>

<p>Harvey suggests that we can find an alternative to this through
struggle &#8216;to regain popular control of the state apparatus&#8217;. But
this is a problem. Any self-respecting political activist will
support struggles which help to limit the control our rulers have
over us. But is this enough? Note the strange sound of the word
&#8216;regain&#8217;. Does Harvey really mean to suggest that there was once
a point where the state apparatus was under popular control?</p>

<p>The issue here runs deeper than a difference over political
tactics. Harvey follows the valuable work of Dum&#233;nil and Levy (< a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/2005/xx/crisis.htm" target="new">reviewed</a> in <strong>IS 2&nbsp;:&nbsp;108</strong>) in tracing how the crisis of global profitability emerged in the late 1960s, the extent of its
resolution and the way that the redistribution of wealth and income
has changed. But despite his effective summary of these trends he
offers no real examination of where the crisis of profitability came
from in the first place. Instead he characterises the period after
1945 as an era of &#8216;embedded liberalism&#8217;, meaning by this some
form of welfare capitalism. Corporate power was constrained by state
ownership, planning and regulation, and inequality held in check by
the welfare state.</p>

<p>There are two obvious difficulties with this that bear directly on
Harvey&#8217;s argument. The first is that if the democratic deficit was
less after 1945 than it is now, it was still substantial. Socialists,
including Harvey, have argued that state action never confronted the
fundamentals of the capitalist system, but aimed to perpetuate them.
Even then the redistributive impact of the state was less than is
often imagined, as any critique of earlier welfare states would show.</p>

<p>The second obvious problem is that this system broke down. When
the crisis of profitability began to emerge, attempts to use more of
the same failed. State action was undermined by global flows of
capital and goods; the state&#8217;s own fiscal crisis; and political
polarisation. Harvey describes all of this but he does not want to
discuss its implications for the future, and the possibility and
direction of change.</p>

<p>History certainly shows that neoliberalism is but one of the forms
capitalism can take. The analysis Harvey makes also shows that the
system is more neo-liberal in rhetoric than practice and that its
stability is far from assured. This means that the state is an area
of struggle. But Harvey, like Joel Bakan in his The Corporation,
risks the charge of nostalgia by presenting a return to the past as a
solution for the future.</p>

<p>There is little in Harvey&#8217;s account here to tease out exactly
how he would resolve this. But it is not hard to see that the central
hole in his analysis is the nature of state power. He repeats the
failing of Karl Polanyi, who he draws on at a number of points. In
<strong>The Great Transformation</strong>, published at the end of the Second
World War, Polanyi wrote a devastating indictment of <em>laissez-faire</em>
liberalism as an attempt to impose a utopian doctrine on the world.
Out of its failure came depression, poverty and war but out of it
also came a determination of society through the state and community
to assert itself against the liberals. This analysis remains much in
the minds of all critics of neo-liberalism. But what I have elsewhere
called the Polanyi problem (See <strong>Journal of European Economic
History</strong>, 1998, 27&nbsp;(3)) here becomes the Harvey problem. Just
what are these things called &#8216;society&#8217;, &#8216;the community&#8217; and
the &#8216;state&#8217;? And in whose interest do they work and with what limits?</p>

<p>This is not only a problem for Harvey&#8217;s political analysis. It
also affects his economic discussion. He sees a key part of the
neo-liberal agenda as involving what he calls &#8216;accumulation by
dispossession&#8217; &#8211; effectively a primitive accumulation of capital.
Accumulation by dispossession is a nice concept but it needs careful
application. Here, for example, he defines it as having four main
features: &#8216;privatisation and commodification&#8217;;
&#8216;financialisation&#8217;; &#8216;the management and manipulation of
crises&#8217;; and &#8216;state redistribution&#8217;. The elements are clear but
they form a ragbag category and seem to confuse a number of different things.</p>

<p>When Marx wrote of the original primitive accumulation of capital
in the 16th and 17th centuries he saw it as a process involving two
related aspects. One was plunder from outside of the system &#8211; gold
from the Americas for example. The other was the separation of labour
from the means of production &#8211; for example, forcing peasants off
their land through the enclosure acts. Today it is puzzling to
imagine a process which involves either a significant accumulation
from outside of the system or by the separation of workers from
control of the means of production &#8211; for where in the last century
has that control been evident? This is most clear when Harvey tries
to apply it to the heartlands of capitalism.</p>

<p>Harvey might want to make the argument that this can be seen in
the incorporation of previously state controlled economies like
Russia and China into global capitalism. But this presumes that these
societies were non-capitalist in the first place &#8211; a point that
would be rejected here but is not explicitly confronted. But Harvey
appears to want to go further than this and suggest that similar
processes can be seen within advanced capitalism. The idea of
&#8216;accumulation by dispossession&#8217; seems to suggest that what might
appear as a normal part of crisis restructuring, where there is a
movement from control being held in one capitalist &#8216;pocket&#8217; to
another, is, in reality, a movement from a &#8216;non-capitalist pocket&#8217;
to a capitalist one.</p>

<p>So he writes, for example, of whole state sectors being opened up
as &#8216;new fields for capital accumulation&#8217; from public utilities to
welfare provision to warfare. We can agree that with privatisation
these have become more ruthlessly subject to the &#8216;calculus of
profitability&#8217; but it does not make sense to argue that they were
outside of this before. This suggests a strange view of the nature of
the capitalist state, whether in its welfare or warfare forms.
Financialisation seems more to refer to a redistribution within the
system, as does the management of crises and state redistribution.
Most of what Harvey discusses here seems familiar in terms of crisis
theory, and given his argument that things should be called by their
proper names it is perhaps unhelpful to try to give these the
additional gloss of &#8216;dispossession&#8217;.</p>

<p>There are then serious arguments to be had. But these should not
alter the fact that this is also a good account of neoliberalism and
one that we can draw on to sharpen our attacks on the malign and
cynical self-interest that Harvey suggests motivates it.</p>
