<p class="fst">&#8216;Tell me what you think about Hungary and I will tell you who
you are,&#8217; said a Polish writer in late November 1956. So in this
spirit let us make a declaration. The Hungarian Revolution of 1956
was an authentic working class revolution. Other factors were
involved; revolutions are complex things. But the driving forces of
the Hungarian Revolution were the efforts of the workers. First they
established organs of popular power. Then they fought to extend them
to defend Hungary against the invading Soviet forces that eventually
allowed the puppet government of J&#225;nos K&#225;d&#225;r to crush the revolt:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Most of the provincial councils and workers&#8217; councils
in the capital became, to an ever increasing degree, representative
of an attitude unknown in Hungary: the belief in self-government, or
to put it in other words, government by soviets, in the original
sense of the term &#8211; people&#8217;s councils, organs of local power. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Neither then nor now did the revolt fit into a conflict between
Washington and Moscow, between West and East. On 7 November, as
Russian forces fought Hungarian workers in Budapest, a group of
fighters in T&#252;zolt&#243; Street ran up a red flag in honour of the
October Revolution, the fortieth anniversary of which fell that day.
The fluttering flag, like others in those desperate days, signalled a
different version of socialism not only in Hungary but the world
over. The flag was a rebuke to a Soviet imperialism that had grown
upon the ashes of the real October Revolution. For this reason such
flags also found little favour in the West. &#8216;We wish for neither
capitalism nor Stalinism,&#8217; said the Revolutionary Council of
Budapest University. And this is the problem. With Stalinism and the
USSR gone, the pressure everywhere is to reinterpret the past as a
march to Western capitalism. So the role of the workers in the
Hungarian Revolution remains an embarrassment. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<h4>The Hungarian Revolution</h4>

<p class="fst">Hungary in 1956 was a small European country of some 10 million
people. Once a central part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was
now reduced in size and status by two world wars and the unhappy
period between them of authoritarian rule, repression and failed
development. It was occupied by the Soviet army at the end of the
Second World War and incorporated into the Soviet bloc as the Cold
War developed. For Moscow, Hungary was in the front line against NATO
to the West. For Washington, the Hungarians were another of Moscow&#8217;s
&#8216;captive peoples&#8217;, a bargaining chip in the jousting for position
that characterised the whole Cold War era.</p>

<p>The events of 1956, however, did not derive directly from
geopolitical competition. They were a product of the way in which
Cold War pressures manifested themselves internally as economic,
social and political contradictions. The Eastern European regimes
claimed to be socialist but they were driven forward by a competitive
industrialisation in which the resources for accumulation were
squeezed from the mass of the population using whatever repression
was necessary. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> But on the mass of people pressure was so intense
as to become counter-productive, and after Stalin&#8217;s death in 1953
his successors signalled a degree of relaxation. However,
contradictory messages, policy changes, and admissions of the
monstrous levels of repression in the past &#8211; culminating in the
denunciation of Stalin&#8217;s behaviour by the new Russian leader Nikita
Khrushchev in his &#8216;secret speech&#8217; of February 1956 &#8211; opened up
a space for the open, if still cautious, articulation of discontent.</p>

<p>In Hungary M&#225;ty&#225;s R&#225;kosi, &#8216;Stalin&#8217;s best Hungarian
disciple&#8217;, was sidelined from Moscow in favour of Imre Nagy, a
loyal but reform minded &#8216;Stalinist&#8217;, in 1953. But Nagy could not
consolidate his grip and a change in the balance of power in Moscow
enabled R&#225;kosi to come back in 1955 and expel Nagy from the
Communist Party. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> Blind to the pressure for change, R&#225;kosi&#8217;s
triumph was short-lived. After Khrushchev&#8217;s secret speech R&#225;kosi
again found support draining in Moscow &#8211; Khrushchev later talked of
&#8216;that idiot R&#225;kosi&#8217;. At home the growing ferment in the
Hungarian Communist Party was reflected in huge popular debates held
by the Pet&#246;fi Circle &#8211; initially a forum for party youth.</p>

<p>Critics of the regime were emboldened by events in Poland where
June 1956 saw a near-rising of workers against the regime in Poznan.
<a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> Moscow removed R&#225;kosi (he now thought of himself as &#8216;the last
Mohican of the Stalinist era in Eastern Europe&#8217;) on 18 July, and
replaced him, not with a reformer like Nagy, but another man
identified with the old Stalinist era &#8211; Ern&#246; Ger&#246;. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> Meanwhile
growing revelations about the many victims of Stalinism in Hungary,
most notably L&#225;szl&#243; Rajk, a leading Communist minister executed as
a traitor and spy in the paranoia of 1949&#8211;50, stimulated further
defiance. The new prime minister, Heged&#252;s, said that &#8216;by now a big
part of the media is not controlled by the party any more&#8217;. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> The
Hungarian leadership was forced to allow the ceremonial reburial of
the body of Rajk on 6 October and this led to a spontaneous
demonstration of support for change. &#8216;The reburial of Rajk&#8217;s
remains dealt a massive blow to the party leadership, whose authority
was not all that high to begin with,&#8217; Ger&#246; told the Soviet
ambassador, Yuri Andropov. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>The real explosion came just over a fortnight later on 23 October.
Students had called a demonstration in support of Poland, where a
reformist government seemed to be standing up to severe political and
military pressure from Moscow. But the demonstration immediately
brought tens of thousands on to the streets . The regime felt the
full force of popular anger when the hated state security secret
police &#8211; the 50,000-strong AVH &#8211; fired upon crowds.</p>

<p>The revolt went through three stages.</p>

<p>From 23 to 28 October there was disorder as protests spread and
the old order began to disintegrate. &#8216;The democratic storm ... is
... raging in full force,&#8217; said one Hungarian newspaper at this
time. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> In this storm the initiative passed to the streets and the
factories. &#8216;It was the (inner party) opposition who &#8216;prepared&#8217;
the revolution and yet no one was so dumbfounded by the outbreak as
they&#8217;, wrote S&#225;ndor Fekete in an early participant account. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a>
Russian forces initially attempted to come to the aid of the
Hungarian leadership but were then withdrawn as the revolt gathered
force. Nagy was made prime minister but immediately found himself
overtaken by the popular mood.</p>

<p>From 29 October to 3 November a degree of order driven from below
was established. Nagy, at last, responded to popular demands with
announcements of policy changes aimed at democratisation and the
weakening of Moscow&#8217;s grip. But neither he nor anyone in the
Hungarian leadership could offer Moscow the prospect of containing
the ferment from below. For the Russian leadership fear of the
strategic implications of the loss of Hungary and the way revolt was
erupting from the bottom up was too much.</p>

<p>On 4 November the revolution entered its third and longest stage.
Moscow had already decided that it had been a mistake to withdraw
Russian troops and new units had begun to enter Hungary on 1
November. But it was on 4 November that they attacked Budapest and
other centres. There were several days of armed resistance, but the
odds were in favour of the well armed Russian forces. Nagy fled to
the Yugoslav embassy and was later betrayed and executed. Other
leaders were rounded up and arrested; still others fled across the
border to the West along with some 200,000 others (2 percent of the
population). Those who had died fighting the Russians and the old
Hungarian regime were buried in unmarked graves. Since 1989 there has
been a huge effort in Hungary to uncover their fate, but putting a
name on a headstone is a poor memorial if in the process what a
person died for remains hidden from history.</p>

<p>Workers&#8217; councils, formed from 23 October, now continued to
oppose the occupation until December when widespread arrests and
repression finally overcame resistance. It is here, in the role of
these councils, that we see the real nature of 1956 as a social
revolution, and it is exactly this that current accounts are anxious
to bury. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a> But before we examine the workers&#8217; councils in some
detail it is worth pausing a little to say something about the street
fighting in 1956.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Street fighting people: round one</h4>

<p class="fst">On 23 October and in the days following the most visible aspect of
the Hungarian Revolution was the street fighting. For a revolution to
occur state authority must weaken sufficiently to disorient the
forces of repression. This had happened in Hungary. On 23&#8211;24
October the panic in the Budapest leadership was such that some fled
&#8216;into underground bunkers that were unsuitable for any work&#8217;,
according to Soviet politburo members who were there. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> The
regular police proved powerless, and in Budapest a significant number
of the 1,200 officers, led by S&#225;ndor Kop&#225;sci, the Budapest police
chief, defected to the demonstrators. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> The army too was
disorientated. The only major unit to initially obey orders to
repress protests was the Third Army Corps whose commander forced his
men into action and even bombed demonstrators in Tiszakeske and
Kecskemet from the air before he thought better of it and fled to
Russian protection. Most army units took a position of benign
neutrality. Sometimes they intervened to enforce ceasefires on the
state security forces. Occasionally units, as well as individual
soldiers, went directly over to the protesters. The main group
defending the state was therefore the hated state security AVH. It
was because they appeared so isolated that Ger&#246; called on Soviet
forces for support late on 23 October. With some 31,000 troops
immediately at hand, and some 1,100 tanks and air power, this was a
formidable force.</p>

<p>In most of the provinces, where there was also a limited presence
of Russian forces, the Hungarian security forces were soon
overwhelmed, despite the shooting of protesters. Conflict in Budapest
was more costly. At the peak perhaps 15,000 demonstrators, armed with
weapons seized or donated from the civil defence, police and army,
faced the disintegrating AVH and the Russian army. The fighting was
serious at a small number of key points, but both the AVH and
Russians were uncertain of what to do. The Russians had confused
orders. Ordinary troops were quickly disconcerted when they found
that they were facing ordinary Hungarians. There was some
fraternisation. Tensions rose high on 25 October when indiscriminate
shooting led to many deaths outside the Hungarian parliament. On
26&#8211;28 October the radicalisation and polarisation continued, as did
the brutal Russian response &#8211; &#8216;To solitary shots we replied with
salvos,&#8217; said one Soviet commander. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> It was at this point that
Nagy managed to establish a ceasefire and announce that Soviet troops
would withdraw from Budapest &#8211; the start, many hoped, of a
negotiated withdrawal from the whole of Hungary.</p>

<p>The evidence from Budapest is that much of the street fighting was
done by young people, including even schoolchildren. The fighters
tended to form self-organised groups, often around key individuals,
some of whom may have had a murky past, though it is difficult to
separate claim and counter-claim. But it would be wrong to make too
much of this. &#8216;It is touching that it was the hooligans of
Ferencv&#225;ros who created ethics out of nothing during the
revolution,&#8217; said a student at the time. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a> It is clear that a
broad process of radicalisation was occurring. Not the least example
of this was the role of Colonel P&#225;l Mal&#233;ter who became &#8216;the most
popular hero of the revolution&#8217;, for which he would pay with his
life, executed by the K&#225;d&#225;r regime. Mal&#233;ter had had an erratic
career which ran from being a bodyguard of the pre-war dictator
Horthy, to a Russian trained partisan fighting the Nazis and then a
senior figure in the new army. He at first tried to play a neutral
role when he was sent to try to relieve the Kili&#225;n Barracks but then
appealed to the ministry of defence to have Soviet forces withdrawn
to reduce the tension and loss of life. When this was refused he
famously cast his lot with the revolutionaries: &#8216;I must inform you
that I will fire on the first Soviet tank to approach the Kili&#225;n
barracks.&#8217; <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The rise of the workers&#8217; councils</h4>

<p class="fst">Most of Budapest had stopped work, supported by growing strikes in
the rest of the country, while these struggles were taking place. A
new network of committees and councils began to emerge. The echoes of
1917 are obvious. Some of these new forms were factory committees.
These would then link into revolutionary (sometimes called national)
councils or committees. But in smaller places local area-based
councils were formed straight away. The pattern and the names are
often confusing because, unlike in Russia in 1917, there was not time
for more sophisticated forms of organisation to be worked out. But
this does not diminish the central role of these councils or what
they achieved in a short time. &#8216;Without their political pressure,&#8217;
say the authors of the standard Hungarian account edited by Gy&#246;rgy
Litv&#225;n, &#8216;the Nagy government would probably have stopped halfway.&#8217;
<a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> But the significance goes beyond this immediate political
dynamic, which is why they remain so controversial and why they are
so difficult for more conservative accounts to digest.</p>

<p>Budapest was the centre of the workers&#8217; council movement. Once
the second city of a great empire, it was now the overblown head of a
small country and contained nearly a fifth of Hungary&#8217;s population.
Over half of the country&#8217;s industrial output was produced there by
46 percent of its industrial workers. They were concentrated in
engineering works, chemical plants, consumer and food industries.
Here too were a significant part of Hungary&#8217;s building and
transport workers. Industry was not evenly spread within the city.
Two of the most concentrated areas were the &#218;jpest district to the
north and the Csepel island in the Danube to the south, long an
industrial area based around iron, engineering, paper and oil. The
city, split by the Danube, tended to be more industrial on the Pest
side than the Buda, the area developed for the imperial middle class
and now the site of the residences of many of the people who had done
well under R&#225;kosi.</p>

<p>The first Budapest workers&#8217; council was established on 23
October in the &#218;jpest district at the huge Egyes&#252;lt Izz&#243; (United
Lamp) Factory which employed around 10,000 people. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a> A day later
factory committees and workers&#8217; councils were spreading to most of
the city&#8217;s plants and districts. On 29 and 30 October district
workers&#8217; councils began to be created in the areas where the bigger
plants were concentrated &#8211; &#218;jpest, Obuda, Angyalf&#246;ld, Csepel.
Then on 31 October a parliament of workers&#8217; councils for Budapest
was convened with delegates from 24 factories and looked to establish
a new order within them. Many elements of this order remained unclear
but most commentators have been struck by the sophistication of the
demands. The delegates declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The supreme controlling body of the factory is the
workers&#8217; council democratically elected by the workers ... The
director is employed by the factory. The director and highest
employees are to be elected by the workers&#8217; council ... the
director is responsible to the workers&#8217; council in every matter
which concerns the factory. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The councils also looked to the political situation, demanding a
whole range of measures of democratisation and, above all, the
withdrawal of Russian troops. In this process the old instruments of
Stalinist rule were simply pushed aside. The Communist Party and the
official trade unions, two of the means of repressing the working
class and driving forward accumulation, were marginalised. As Lomax
writes, &#8216;When a few days later the government, the Communist Party
and the Central Council of Trade Unions called in turn for the
creation of workers&#8217; councils [in a failed attempt to direct them &#8211;
<em>MH</em>] they were merely giving official recognition to an already
accomplished fact.&#8217; <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p>Inevitably the geography of workers&#8217; councils outside of
Budapest reflected the industrial geography of Hungary, with the
strongest ones in the north and the weaker ones in the towns of the
southern agricultural plains. But, as Peter Fryer, the shocked but
honest reporter for the British Communist Party&#8217;s <strong>Daily Worker</strong>,
put it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">these committees, a network of which now extended across
the whole of Hungary, were remarkably uniform. They were at the same
time organs of insurrection &#8211; the coming together of delegates
elected by factories and universities, mines and army units &#8211; and
organs of popular self-government which the armed people trusted. As
such they enjoyed tremendous authority, and it is no exaggeration to
say that until the Soviet attack of 4 November the real power in the
country lay in their hands. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Listeners to a radio broadcast from Miskolc heard the following
declaration on 25 October: &#8216;We have had enough! Enough of the
autonomy of certain leaders! We too want socialism, but according to
our special Hungarian conditions, reflecting the interests of the
Hungarian working class and the Hungarian nation&#8217;. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> Miskolc was
the second largest town in Hungary. It had a population of some
140,000 in 1956 and was situated to the north east of Budapest in
Borsod county, &#8216;the largest unbroken industrial area in Hungary&#8217;.
<a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a> The whole area had been a centre of rapid expansion in the
post-1948 industrialisation drive, based on concentrated investment
in heavy industry, cement and brickworks, as well as a textile mill.
As Miskolc expanded so it merged with Di&#243;sgy&#246;r, the site of
Hungary&#8217;s first iron foundry and now the main iron and steel centre
as well as the location of a large machine works making rolling stock
and turbines.</p>

<p>It is here that we find the second great centre of the workers&#8217;
councils of 1956. While local students formed a student parliament,
committees were formed in the factories and then workers&#8217; councils.
Things began to move on 22 October with the formation of various
committees and then, on 24 October, a &#8216;labour council&#8217;.
Organisation spread within and between plants in the neighbouring
towns. Government authority collapsed locally in the face of a mass
demonstration in Miskolc on 26 October when 38 people are thought to
have died as state security forces opened fire and the crowd took its
revenge. The workers and students and existing forces which defected
to them quickly restored order and Radio Miskolc could announce on 27
October that &#8216;for two days the town of Miskolc has been under the
leadership of the workers&#8217; council and student parliament.&#8217; The
new councils of the industrial belt linked up to form a countywide
Borsod Workers&#8217; Council. When the claim was later made in Budapest
that what was at stake was a counter-revolution, the Borsod County
Workers&#8217; Council simply said, &#8216;You have only to pick up the
telephone, and in three hours we will be there, the workers of Ozd,
Di&#243;sgy&#246;r, Miskolc, all 20,000 and armed.&#8217; <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p>To the north of Budapest was the smaller town of Salgotarjan. Here
industry was based on coal, iron and steel and there was no
university. Anyone stopping there in late October would have found a
town in which the radicalisation appeared to have involved one of the
most peaceful power shifts. On 25 October a strike became general and
on 27 October there was a march to the town centre. The local
Communist Party attempted to lead the workers&#8217; council movement but
it was pushed aside. But the relative calm of this period would be
deceptive, for in the next phase Salgotarjan would become a major
centre of resistance to Russian invasion and the K&#225;d&#225;r government.</p>

<p>Gy&#246;r had a population of around 70,000 in 1956. Situated on the
Danube, 80 miles north west of Budapest and on the main Budapest to
Vienna route, the town had grown on the basis of the expansion of its
pre-war wagon building works, textiles and consumer goods industries.
Nearby were the coal mining town of Tatab&#225;nya and smaller towns
based on opencast coal and bauxite mining. Some discontent appeared
before 23 October but news of the events in Budapest led to a small
demonstration on 24 October, which quickly snowballed. In the evening
state security forces again opened fire. The next day thousands came
out. Strikes were generalised and local authority collapsed. On 26
October a town-wide National Revolutionary Committee was formed and
the next day Radio Free Gy&#246;r announced that &#8216;national committees
and workers&#8217; councils were being formed everywhere between Gy&#246;r
and Tatab&#225;nya&#8217;. The Gy&#246;r council became the core of the
Transdanubian National Council formed to represent the western half
of Hungary.</p>

<p>While this was happening the state security forces had acted out
another massacre at nearby Mosonmagyar&#243;v&#225;r in which 52 had died.
Order was only restored when the state security police were disarmed
by local troops under the control of the Gy&#246;r council. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> The
strength of the workers&#8217; councils here was based on the Gy&#246;r
factories and nearby mines at Tatab&#225;nya and Balinka. The Gy&#246;r
National Council not only issued a programme, but also ran the town
and even negotiated for a time with local Soviet military leaders.
But its most demanding task was trying to cope with the political
cross currents in Gy&#246;r. The mood in the town was heated and,
especially early on, there was frustration with the timidity of Nagy
in Budapest. Some right wing forces tried to take advantage of this,
as did adventurers, some from within Hungary, others from across the
border. There were several tense episodes before the leaders of the
local council were able to encourage a focus on building a base
through the development of the workers&#8217; council movement in the
wider Transdanubian area.</p>

<p>Further south on the Danube, some 40 miles from Budapest, was
Szt&#225;linv&#225;ros (now Duna&#250;jv&#225;ros). This was intended as the
centrepiece of Hungary&#8217;s new industrial development. In the late
1940s it had only been an overgrown village but in the spring of 1950
the building of the Stalin iron and steel works began under the
supervision of Soviet engineers with ostensibly a model &#8216;socialist&#8217;
community &#8211; the biggest investment project of Hungary&#8217;s first
five year plan. By 1956 Szt&#225;linv&#225;ros had a population of 30,000
and, as in Russia, welfare there very much took second place to
demands of steel output. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p>Agriculture still dominated much of the south of the country. Here
the major towns had been trading, administrative and educational
centres, with their social structure less intensively affected by
Stalinist industrialisation. Debrecen is Hungary&#8217;s third largest
town with a population of some 130,000 in 1956. It had been the scene
of Kossuth&#8217;s short-lived declaration of independence from the
Austrian Empire in 1849 and the base for the Soviet-backed liberation
government in 1944. On 23 October demonstrating students were joined
by workers. Local party leaders ordered forces to open fire, killing
three people. Over the next days talks between representatives of the
local soldiers, students and workers led to the formation of the
Debrecen Socialist Revolutionary Committee which soon became the
effective power in the town until the second Soviet onslaught on 4
November. A second southern town, Szeged, with a population of just
under 100,000, was the place where the first independent student
organisations had been created before 23 October. After the 23
October events in Budapest, students in Szeged were involved in local
protests and occasional clashes until 26 October when security forces
withdrew. Workers&#8217; councils in the local factories were set up
which then linked with student groups to form a People&#8217;s
Revolutionary Council on 30 October. This then began to organise a
local national guard.</p>

<p>Pecs had been the site of Hungary&#8217;s first university and was
also a major trading and agricultural processing centre. In 1956 it
had a population of 110,000. Its post-1948 growth had been affected
by the development of coal mining nearby and uranium mining. Here,
however, the old order held together better in the first days. Local
bosses encouraged factory committees in the belief that they could
put their own people at the head of them but they were pushed aside.
Then, as news spread of events elsewhere, the local state security
police began to crumble. On 28 and 29 October councils were elected
and a national guard created. The Pecs councils were less impressive
in depth than those in the north, but the town would be a major
centre of resistance to Russian forces in the next phase.</p>

<p>It was, however, not just the towns that were affected by the
revolution. As Table 1 shows, Hungary was still a predominantly
agricultural country. Authority began to collapse in the rural areas
on the Saturday and Sunday of 27&#8211;28 October. The process had echoes
of traditional peasant revolt. News arrived of the urban protests,
sometimes brought directly by migrant workers returning from the
factories. Discussions took place in village centres and pubs, and on
the Sunday around and in churches. Fearful of a state which they saw
as both oppressive and exploitative, the peasants, reflecting an
older moral economy, sought to legitimise their revolt symbolically.
Village national committees were elected in many places. While some
of the old, imposed rural leaders fled and others were offered some
kind of protective security, less hated figures might symbolically
hand over village centre keys to the new committees. The state
campaign against religion had been especially resented and therefore
dressing in one&#8217;s Sunday best to go to church had a special
resonance that weekend. Sometimes local Stalinist party secretaries
were made to carry the crosses. Tax records were seen as an
instrument of the power of the state and burned in some places. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a>
Some villagers also loaded carts with food to take to towns both as a
gesture of solidarity and as an assertion of the superior morality of
the gift over the past history of forced deliveries to the state.</p>

<p>The level of politicisation in the countryside was much lower than
in the towns. But, with the power of the state gone, many peasants
took the opportunity to leave what they saw as state organised
agriculture. By early 1957 only around 6 percent of peasants were
left in state cooperatives which now had some 10 to 12 percent of
arable land. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p>The question arose of how far the workers&#8217; councils should
sustain the strike and cooperate with the Nagy government as it began
to broaden the agenda of change under the pressure of the councils.
Almost from the outset delegations had gone to Nagy to influence him.
Then on 1 November, with the Russian forces seemingly withdrawn and
Nagy radicalising his position, delegates from the councils argued
that the strike should be called off while maintaining the general
role of the councils. This produced some sharp local debates but when
the district councils in Csepel and &#218;jpest agreed to support a
return to work the position was endorsed and the date set for Monday
5 November. But the agreement would be rendered redundant by the
second Soviet military assault.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The significance of the workers&#8217; councils</h4>

<p class="fst">What was the significance of the workers&#8217; councils? The fact
that they were set up against a so-called &#8216;socialist state&#8217; and
then destroyed by it should show that neither before nor after 1956
was Hungary in any sense socialist. The fact that the councils
involved workers seizing control of the means of production should
also show that what was wrong with Hungary was not some &#8216;political
degeneration&#8217; at the top but a system which exploited and oppressed
workers both politically and economically. &#8216;The communists
nationalised all the factories and similar enterprises, proclaiming
the slogan, &#8220;The factory is yours &#8211; you work for yourself.&#8221;
Exactly the opposite of this was true. They promised us everything,
at the same time subjugating us and pulling us down to the greatest
misery conceivable,&#8217; said one Csepel worker. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a></p>

<p>But these are only the first questions posed by the workers&#8217;
councils in 1956. Clearly the councils were tools of destruction
through which the old regime was being brought down. But were they,
and can they again be, tools of creation through which a new
democratic economic and political order can be built?</p>

<p>There is a horrible irony in the fact that many historians today,
and not least those in Hungary, are as anxious to dismiss this
possibility as was the K&#225;d&#225;r regime that destroyed the workers&#8217;
councils in 1956. Those for whom the only alternative to dictatorship
is a Western style bourgeois democracy solve the problem of 1956 by
concentrating on the political demands. The re-emergence of some 20
political parties, with the potential to compete for parliamentary
power, was bound, they suggest, to lead to a market transition and,
sooner or later, a degree of privatisation. Nineteen fifty six is
made to anticipate 1989. It was a &#8216;bourgeois revolution&#8217;, said
the Hungarian politician Viktor Orban in 2001. For Peter Kende, one
of a number of participants who now doubt their own past, &#8216;by
history&#8217;s inscrutable logic the Hungarian people seem to have
achieved in 1989 what they fought for in 1956&#8217;. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a> Litv&#225;n,
another participant historian, is less direct, redefining 1956 (in a
phrase of Istv&#225;n Bib&#243;) as a &#8216;revolution in human dignity&#8217;. But
all revolutions involve the oppressed asserting their dignity against
the oppressor. Moreover dignity comes in different forms &#8211; not all
of them compatible. If people in 1956 did not believe it could be
found in the old system, they equally did not seem to believe it
could be found in the restoration of other discredited forms. Istvan
Bib&#243;, who attempted to theorise what was happening at the time,
called it &#8216;the beginning of one of the most exciting socialist
experiments of the century&#8217;. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a> &#8216;The intended economic order&#8217;,
writes Litv&#225;n&#8217;s group of historians, &#8216;would place decision
making in industry, mining and transport in the hands of the
producers.&#8217; But sooner or later, they also imply, workers would
have been forced away from this &#8216;possibly utopian&#8217; road. &#8216;The
healing of a ruined economy was impossible without a more or less
free market.&#8217; <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a></p>

<p>But if the workers&#8217; councils were incompatible with a Stalinist
state capitalism masquerading as &#8216;socialism&#8217;, how could they have
been compatible with more free market capitalism either? It is true
that what was called &#8216;workers&#8217; participation&#8217; existed in some
social democracies and in Yugoslavia in the 1950s, but participation
is not control. These were top down initiatives in which real
influence from below was severely constrained. The importance and
challenge of the Hungarian councils lie in their contradiction to
these lesser visions of change. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a></p>

<p>The Hungarian workers&#8217; councils grew from the bottom up and were
marked by the breadth and depth of participation. They combined
national demands with a fundamental social agenda which looked to a
new system moulded from the workers&#8217; councils, independent free
trade unions and competing socialist parties. This idea is less
distinctive than some have suggested. It recaptured elements of an
earlier socialist tradition (even, we would suggest, a Bolshevik one)
that had been squeezed out by the statism of social democracy and the
one-party developmental dictatorship of Stalinism. Its base would lie
in the claim that &#8216;the factories must become truly collective, and
not capitalist property&#8217; and the argument, expressed in different
forms, that &#8216;the working class itself wants a guarantee that it
will be armed so that it can stop any force from negating the basic
aim of the revolution and its achievements so far&#8217;. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p>Here at least we must grant the K&#225;d&#225;r regime the virtue of
consistency. For it the workers&#8217; councils were a fantasy in theory
and mob rule in practice. They had no creative element; they were
simply destructive. The regime was quick to identify every incident
and build it up as one of the crimes of 1956. The most notorious,
perhaps, was on 30 October when state security police opened fire
from inside the Budapest Communist Party headquarters. Protesters
returned the fire, killing, among others, Imre Mez&#246;, the local party
secretary and Nagy supporter, and then lynched a number of the people
in the building, some of whom may not have been involved in the
shooting. But the regime&#8217;s own data puts any popular violence into
perspective. There were, it claimed, 215 &#8216;victims of
counter-revolution&#8217; of whom were 169 were military; 14 of these
were claimed to have died from summary execution. Forty six deaths
were civilians, of whom eight were Communist officials killed or
lynched by crowds. &#8216;Believe me, we are not sadists, but we cannot
bring ourselves to regret those kind of people,&#8217; said one
contemporary who was asked. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a> The majority of deaths, even if they
were all regime deaths, clearly came in the fighting. All the
occasional indiscriminate &#8216;crimes&#8217; of the real revolution cost no
more lives than a single massacre by the forces of the Hungarian
state or the Russian army. Far from the revolution involving
widespread mob rule, the Litv&#225;n group writes, &#8216;there is abundant
evidence that the freedom fighters themselves penalised any
lawlessness resolutely&#8217;. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p>Most present day accounts want to claim that the councils had
limited capacity. But the creative energy and self-discipline of the
councils create a problem for them. The historical undermining of the
legacy of the workers&#8217; councils today does not derive from a grand
theory of bourgeois democracy or the majesty of its reality. Where is
such a reality today? Rather it derives from an accommodation to
current practice. Historical accounts inevitably reflect the time in
which they are written. The best can partly rise above this and
connect past, present and a range of new futures; the worst bludgeon
the present into the past to deny any future other than what is. The
political vision that emerged out of the transition in Hungary was a
narrow one, and leading Hungarian intellectuals accommodated to it.
It does past, present and future a grave disservice.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Street fighting people: round two</h4>

<p class="fst">&#8216;Today at dawn&#8217;, Imre Nagy broadcast on Sunday 4 November,
&#8216;Soviet troops attacked our capital with the obvious intention of
overthrowing the legitimate government.&#8217; The second Soviet
intervention, &#8216;Whirlwind&#8217;, was more massive and better organised
than the first. The Hungarian army was immediately demobilised by
Russian troops. The new National Guard had had no time to organise
for such a contest. Potential leaders like Mal&#233;ter were arrested.
Kop&#225;sci was soon rounded up. Resistance again had to come from
below. The Soviet general Zhukov later claimed that his forces had to
disarm 35,000 Hungarians. This may be true but they could never have
matched a major army.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the stand taken in key areas was heroic in the face
of often overwhelming force. Fierce fighting took place in several
provincial centres including Pecs in the south. But generally the
stiffness of resistance reflected the distribution of sections of the
working class. &#8216;The greatest armed resistance to the Soviet forces
occurred in the large iron and steel centres of Dunapentele, Ozd and
Miskolc, and in the mining regions of Borsod, Tantab&#225;nya and Pecs,&#8217;
writes Lomax. At Dunapentele, the former Szt&#225;linv&#225;ros, the workers&#8217;
council faced with the Soviet army declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Dunapentele is the foremost socialist town in Hungary.
Its inhabitants are workers, and power is in their hands. The houses
have all been built by workers themselves. The workers will defend
the town from &#8216;fascist excesses&#8217; but also from Soviet troops. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Within Budapest the same pattern emerged. In the centre street
fighting was hard at the Kili&#225;n Barracks, Corvin Passage and T&#252;zolt&#243;
Street &#8211; all these places became legendary. But it was also
considerable in &#218;jpest and Kobanya. It was no less fierce on the
Cespel Island where workers held out until 10&#8211;11 November.</p>

<p>In 1957 the K&#225;d&#225;r government was quick to issue its own data to
claim that the cost of violence was greater during the first wave of
fighting, when the Soviet army withdrew, than in the second wave
after its re-entry. Its &#8216;order&#8217; was supposedly preferable to the
&#8216;disorder&#8217; of the revolution. &#8216;Two thirds of the injured were
wounded before 3 November and one third after 4 November.&#8217; But the
figures, based on hospital admissions, can hardly be a guide since
arrest was more likely after 4 November. The deaths seem to have been
40 percent in the first round and 60 percent in the second round of
fighting. Property destruction was largely a product of the second
phase. The regime claimed only 4 percent of housing in Greater
Budapest as a whole was damaged but this somewhat foolish statistic
could not hide that fact that 23 percent of housing had been damaged
in the 9th Ferencv&#225;ros district and 18 percent in the Jozsefv&#225;ros
district. Fifty percent of the Budapest dead were recorded in these
two districts and the 7th. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a> As Peter Fryer wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I have just come out of Budapest, where for six days I
have watched Hungary&#8217;s new born freedom tragically destroyed by
Soviet troops ... Vast areas of the city &#8211; the working class areas
above all &#8211; are virtually in ruins. For four days and nights
Budapest was under continuous bombardment. I saw a once lovely city
battered, bludgeoned, smashed and bled into submission. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The data on the Budapest dead tell an even clearer social story of
a predominance of working class youth. Twenty percent of the dead
were under 20 years old, and 28 percent aged between 20 and 29.
Seventy five percent of the injured were reported to be under 30;
1,330 of the dead were recorded as workers, only 44 as students.
Another K&#225;d&#225;r source suggested that &#8216;according to the figures
supplied by the hospitals, 80 to 90 percent of the wounded were young
workers, while students represented no more than 3 to 5 percent&#8217;.
<a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Resistance and the struggle for power</h4>

<p class="fst">With the armed resistance crushed by 10&#8211;11 November a month and a
half of passive resistance to occupation and counter-revolution
began. The Hungarian army had disintegrated, the political leaders
had been arrested or had fled, and writers and intellectuals, however
prominent, lacked an organisational base of their own. It was the
workers&#8217; councils which were the basis of opposition and they stood
at the head of a general strike. &#8216;We are and shall remain the
leaders in Hungary,&#8217; said S&#225;ndor Racz when he was elected
president of the new Central Workers&#8217; Council in Budapest. Despite
the continued emphasis in some accounts on the role of intellectuals,
the Writers Association passed a motion on 12 November which read,
&#8216;We throw in our lot with the Hungarian working class, the
peasantry and the revolutionary youth, and in the course of further
developments we shall work together with their democratically elected
organisations.&#8217; <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p>It is not difficult to see why. If we take industrial production
in September as 100 then in October it was 71.1 percent of that level
and in November a mere 17.6 percent. Even with the actions of the
authorities in December it only rose to a monthly figure of 30.5
percent of the September level. To close down over 80 percent of
industrial production effectively for over a month must register as
one of the most complete and sustained general strikes in history.
And in particular sectors for which data was collected by the
statisticians the strike was even more effective. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p>A journalist writing for the <strong>Observer</strong> in Britain reported the
situation in mid-November:</p>

<p class="quoteb">A fantastic aspect of the situation is that although the
general strike is in being ... the workers are nevertheless taking it
upon themselves to keep essential services going, for the purposes
which they themselves determine and support. Workers&#8217; councils in
industrial districts have undertaken the distribution of essential
goods and food to the population in order to keep them alive. The
coal miners are making daily allocations of just sufficient coal to
keep the power stations going and supply the hospitals in Budapest
and other large towns. Railwaymen organise trains to go to approved
destinations for approved purposes ... <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The impact of the invasion on the workers&#8217; and revolutionary
councils was uneven. In some areas they quickly collapsed but those
based on factory committees in urban, working class environments
proved more resilient and their organisation deepened. So strong was
it that the K&#225;d&#225;r government was forced to temporarily recognise
the workers&#8217; councils while trying to gain time to contain and
undermine them and pick off their leaders. In some areas arrests
began immediately. On 5 November, for example, 12 members of the
Borsod workers&#8217; councils attempted to negotiate and were arrested
and taken out of Hungary. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a> Occasionally, however, such arrests
had to be rescinded and negotiations were held with Soviet commanders
to this effect.</p>

<p>The biggest developments were in Budapest. On 12 November the
Revolutionary Workers&#8217; Council of &#218;jpest proposed the creation of
a Central Workers&#8217; Council for Greater Budapest. In spite of
attempts by the authorities to disrupt it, on 14 November the new
Central Council met at the Egyes&#252;lt Izz&#246; plant. The meeting, which
was chaotic, elected a provisional committee made up from delegates
from the district workers&#8217; councils. <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a> As in any revolution,
individuals were thrown up who quickly proved unequal to the task and
were replaced by others who found a strength, courage and vision that
perhaps they had not appreciated they had. Two of these were workers
from the Beloiannis electrical factory. S&#225;ndor Racz was a young tool
fitter who was soon elected president of the council. S&#225;ndor Bali,
another tool fitter, was older and more experienced, having been a
past member of the Social Democratic Party and Communist Party but
also having conspicuously refused to take advantage of the
possibilities of social mobility that the regime offered before 1956.</p>

<p>It was Bali who was the leading influence on the perspectives of
the Central Workers&#8217; Council. These involved seeing it as the
organising centre for the Budapest workers&#8217; councils. It became,
said Bal&#225;sz Nagy, &#8216;a hive of activity&#8217;. New elections were held
in the factory committees and workers&#8217; councils to ensure the
legitimacy of these organisations and hence the Central Council
itself. &#8216;The factories are in our hands, the hands of the workers&#8217;
councils,&#8217; said one leaflet from late November. But the key
political issue was whether to negotiate with the K&#225;d&#225;r regime. The
brute face of military power was everywhere. Bali therefore proposed
that the Central Council negotiate but refuse any formal recognition
of the government. But negotiate to what effect? The Central Council
and the councils on which it drew were determined to deepen their
role. The big immediate weapon they had was the general strike. But
general strikes cannot last indefinitely, especially one so complete.
The most conservative voices argued for the strike to be called off
to give K&#225;d&#225;r time to show his intentions. The most radical argued
for it to be maintained to the bitter end, come what may.</p>

<p>In the midst of military occupation, with perhaps 2,000 dead
already and many more wounded and under arrest, the difficulty of
these choices should not be underestimated. In the event the position
that won was to agree to return to work in return for concessions.
But what concessions, and could the government be trusted? This
produced sharp arguments in some of the Budapest districts and
committees. In Csepel, for example, leaders who saw this position as
too radical were removed in favour of delegates who thought it too
moderate. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a> Racz argued that the workers&#8217; councils were in a
position of growing strength: &#8216;The government is now beginning to
make certain concessions, and it will make still more. We just have
to force it to do so. We must wait until work has been resumed
everywhere, because otherwise the Russians will occupy the industrial
centres and replace the workers. The question now is whether we will
be the masters or the Soviet command.&#8217; <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a> Outside of Budapest too
there were divisions. Some miners took the view, &#8216;You can work if
you want, but we shall provide neither coal nor electricity; we shall
flood the mines.&#8217; <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a> But negotiations went ahead with the K&#225;d&#225;r
regime for the removal of Soviet troops, the generalisation of
workers&#8217; councils, and the defence of the right to strike. The
return to work was set for 17 November.</p>

<p>But the government&#8217;s position was well described by a British
reporter. Its aim was &#8216;to divert workers&#8217; councils into innocuous
channels by &#8220;legalising&#8221; them as organs of economic
self-government, somewhat on the Yugoslav model, but denying them the
right to put forward political demands or issue a newspaper&#8217;. The
perspectives were far apart and &#8216;merely led to continued deadlock
in Budapest&#8217;. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a></p>

<p>To maintain its position the Central Council could not stand
still. The organisation had to be widened. Accordingly on 19 November
it accepted a plan to create a new Parliament of Workers&#8217; Councils
and made an appeal for delegates to meet in Budapest on 21 November.
But when delegates arrived at the sports stadium where the meeting
was due to be held they found it surrounded by Soviet tanks (some
called them &#8216;K&#225;d&#225;r taxis&#8217;). A smaller meeting was held at the
headquarters of the Central Council which, again after debate,
accepted its positions. But while the talk was going on, workers,
fearing that delegates had been more widely arrested, were coming out
on strike again and on 22&#8211;23 November Budapest was hit by a general
strike which also served to commemorate the outbreak of the
revolution a month earlier. The Central Council had no choice but to
put itself at the head of this.</p>

<p>The K&#225;d&#225;r regime and Soviet forces were far from idle during
this time. It is clear now that J&#225;nos K&#225;d&#225;r swung to become the
figurehead of the Russian invasion quite late on. When he arrived in
Budapest on 7 November in a Russian armoured car he had no plan or
authority other than that given to him by the Russian army. <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a> The
secret police had gone, the army had disintegrated, and government
was in disarray. His new &#8216;party&#8217; &#8211; the Hungarian Socialist
Workers Party &#8211; barely existed (in December it only had 37,000
members, a few percent of the old Communist Party). In the next weeks
K&#225;d&#225;r talked but refused to yield, supported as he was by the
Soviet occupation. Imre Nagy and his supporters were tricked out of
the Yugoslav embassy with the complicity of the Yugoslav government
on 23 November, arrested and taken out of Hungary. But K&#225;d&#225;r also
tried to build a new base for himself through the formation of the
Hungarian Revolutionary [<em>sic</em>] Home Guard Militia, which was
supplemented in early 1957 by a &#8216;Workers&#8217; [<em>sic</em>] Guard&#8217;.</p>

<p>It was the militia, with the Russian army, that would eventually
crush the revolution in December. Another strand of K&#225;d&#225;r&#8217;s
policy was to send out the signal that there would be no return to
the past, whatever repression followed, Attempts were made to buy off
working class discontent with backdated pay rises, peasant discontent
with concessions on forced deliveries and agricultural process, and
the discontent of small craftsmen through tax and property changes.
R&#225;kosi and Ger&#246; remained in exile and gestures were made on
religious freedom and towards an even more obvious co-option of
national symbols. But the regime, like all established orders, had an
additional weapon and a very powerful one &#8211; time. It could sit it
out and try to stretch out negotiations to a point when it felt able
to move. By early December K&#225;d&#225;r and others seem to have begun to
feel that their time was coming.</p>

<p>The Central Workers&#8217; Council (CWC) did not want the provocation
of a major demonstration on 4 December, a month on from the second
Soviet invasion. Fearing the consequences if the authorities used
force against a mass demonstration, an evocative procession was
organised of some 30,000 women dressed in black. They walked through
Budapest until they encountered Soviet troops. The demonstration was
deeply symbolic and moving. But in terms for the balance of power
between the councils and the government it was too little. The
authorities now began to move quickly.</p>

<p>The K&#225;d&#225;r regime began to widen arrests and then news came
through that on 8 December a massacre had occurred at Salg&#243;tarj&#225;n,
with the arrest the leaders of miners&#8217; workers&#8217; councils and the
shooting of 39 demonstrating miners. The Central Council meeting in
Budapest called a 48-hour general strike for 11&#8211;12 December, &#8216;the
like of which has never before been seen in the history of the
workers&#8217; movement&#8217;, an official Hungarian paper was forced to
report. <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a> The government responded by declaring that the CWC and
local councils were illegal (but not yet the factory committees) and
declaring a state of emergency. Some 200 working class leaders were
rounded up and arrested. Racz and Bali were major targets but they
were protected for a time by the workers in their factory. They were
only induced out by a duplicitous personal offer from K&#225;d&#225;r to
negotiate. They were then arrested. When other strikes and
demonstrations against the arrests were called the response was just
as ruthless as it had been in Salg&#243;tarj&#225;n. Workers were shot down
in the streets in several places including Miskolc, Eger and Zalaegerszeg.</p>

<p>Workers&#8217; opposition was now forced underground and on 5 January
1957 the government announced the death penalty for a refusal to work
and strike agitation. Several workers&#8217; councils ceremoniously
dissolved themselves rather than just fade away under the weight of
this repression. The Csepel council said that to continue &#8216;would be
to deceive our comrades. We therefore return our mandate to the
workers.&#8217; <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a> When, on 8 January, workers on the Csepel Island
demonstrated their support they too were met with Soviet tanks and
more were killed. Five days later the K&#225;d&#225;r government further
widened the death penalty. The regime was able to move on and suspend
the Writers Association on 18 January and close the Journalists Club
on the 20th. After nearly three months the Hungarian Revolution had
finally been crushed.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The pattern of repression</h4>

<p class="fst">The story of a revolution can also be told through the nature of
the victims when it is repressed. The weight of repression has
obviously to serve as a warning to the main social forces involved
never to attempt the same again. Here too then we find evidence of
the absolute centrality of the workers&#8217; councils. Arrests began to
mount between November 1956 and the end of 1959. Some 100,000 were
arrested, 26,000 tried and 22,000 sentenced; 229 formal death
sentences were passed but accounts suggest that as many as 350
executions may have occurred. Those of Imre Nagy, Mal&#233;ter and others
were the most prominent. Leading intellectuals were jailed. But the
target of repression was much more the working class. The majority of
the arrested and sentenced &#8216;were workers 20 to 30 years of age&#8217;.
Death sentences fell especially on workers accused, rightly or
wrongly, of street fighting. Among the arrested &#8216;the group that
contributed the greatest number of those sentenced consisted of the
members of the workers&#8217; councils and revolutionary committees from
factories and local institutions&#8217;. Death sentences were rarer but
long prison sentences the norm, including life (for Bali and R&#225;cz,
for example). Despite later amnesties &#8216;quantitatively ... this
group was hardest hit, by both judicial sentences and by extra-legal
measures of repression&#8217;. As the Litv&#225;n history notes, the
targeting of this group was hardly an &#8216;accident&#8217; but &#8216;a major
goal of the repression&#8217;. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Fifty years on</h4>

<p class="fst">Once the threat of the revolution had been overcome K&#225;d&#225;r began
to build bridges to the Hungarian people. From the early 1960s he
became the most successful Eastern bloc leader. But the memory of
1956 still had to be contained through suppression and distortion.
The same process is at work today but the politics are different.</p>

<p>When the Soviet bloc collapsed in 1989, &#8216;the transformation in
Hungary was perhaps the most tranquil of all&#8217;. <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a> This was a
negotiated transition, negotiated in no small part by those who had
made their careers under K&#225;d&#225;r and who saw the chance not only to
survive but also to prosper in a new Hungary. Manipulating 1956 as a
&#8216;national&#8217; myth served the interests of these people as well as a
new generation of leaders committed to the market and private
property. Today Hungary is a member of the European Union. It is an
ally of the United States, and the share of multinationals in its
manufacturing turnover is over 70 percent &#8211; second only to Ireland.
Ordinary Hungarians, however, like most ordinary people in the
transition regimes, have seen fewer of the benefits of change. This
has been especially the case in the industrial areas that were the
core of 1956.</p>

<p>In this new situation the radical interpretation of 1956 is
unwelcome. So too is a recognition of the hollowness of Western
policy in 1956 which was strong on rhetoric but involved standing by
to allow Russia to crush the revolution and maintain its sphere of
interest and the overall balance of power. &#8216;Alas, the logic of
great power policy made accomplices of many otherwise honourable
Western politicians&#8217;, writes the Litv&#225;n group. <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a> This is
self-deceit of the worst kind, for 1956 was the year of both Hungary
and Suez. It simply writes into history the cynical idea that it is
better for a small country to prostrate itself voluntarily before
Washington and Brussels than be enslaved by Moscow.</p>

<p>Did Hungarian workers want to control their own lives? The
self-deceit works again. Of course, but now it must be understood
that freedom can never be anything more than the freedom to apply to
work for this or that multinational and their freedom to reject you.</p>
<p>But the story of 1956 is bigger than this. Different regimes in
France struggled to contain the legacy of its great revolution for
200 years. But it has not always been easy. One of the songs heard on
the streets of Budapest in 1956 was in fact the <em>Marseillaise</em>.
What Kende now calls &#8216;history&#8217;s inscrutable logic&#8217; is often
more inscrutable than those who invoke it suggest. Connecting to the
real history of 1956 shows that its legacy is much more open than
many would like us to believe.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f2" name="n2">2.</a> It is ironic that accounts of the post-1956 K&#225;d&#225;r regime
often paid more attention to the &#8216;counter-revolutionary&#8217; role of
workers in 1956 than some post-1989 Hungarian accounts. The main
translated general history of the post-1989 era, Ignac Romsic&#8217;s
<strong>Hungary in the Twentieth Century</strong> (Corvina, 1999), (which
incidentally concludes with a near racist celebration of Hungary&#8217;s
thousand year struggle to resist &#8216;Asian and Eurasian tyranny&#8217; in
favour of membership of the Christian West) does not mention the
workers&#8217; councils in its discussion of the first stages of the
revolution. It then gives them scant attention in the resistance
except when they became victims of repression. &#8216;The spirit of the
revolution,&#8217; Romsic argues, &#8216;lived on most conspicuously among
groups of intellectuals&#8217; (p.&nbsp;316).</p>

ever rational is an interesting question but whatever logic it had
was further undermined as it was being planned by Stalin&#8217;s dispute
with Tito in Yugoslavia, which denied the iron and steel works
expected supplies from that country. Horv&#225;th&#8217;s study of
Szt&#225;linv&#225;ros shows that many of the new workers and especially the
skilled ones came from other towns including Budapest. This confirms
the pattern evident in the work of Mark Pittaway which stresses the
role of skilled workers in 1956. See, for example, M. Pittaway, <em>The
Reproduction of Hierarchy: Skill, Working Class Culture, and the
State in Early Socialist Hungary</em>, <strong>Journal of Modern History</strong>,
