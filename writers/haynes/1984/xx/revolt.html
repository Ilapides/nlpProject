<p class="fst">In the years between 1910 and the outbreak of the war in August
1914 the British working class went through a period of unparalleled
militancy. In industry after industry workers went on strike, many
becoming organised for the first time as union membership leapt from
2,477,000 at the end of 1909 to 4,135,000 at the end of 1913. Troops
were called in as some disputes grew into local general strikes.
Naval gunboats and army machine guns were made ready in case of need
and several &#8216;rioters&#8217; were shot and many more injured in clashes
with troops and police. Periodically the strike wave appeared to ebb
and &#8216;society&#8217; could breathe a heavy sigh of relief. It was in
this vein that the <strong>Times</strong> wrote in August 1913 that &#8216;strikes
are no longer of interest except in so far as languid attention may
be given to events 6,000 miles away on the Rand&#8217;. But then the wave
of militancy would flood forward again and only a month after strikes
appeared &#8216;no longer of interest&#8217; the <strong>Times</strong> had to
breathlessly report that &#8216;Dublin is now practically in a state of
civil war between Labour and Capital&#8217;. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
For four long years this pattern was maintained making what
contemporaries called &#8216;the labour unrest&#8217; the longest period of
sustained militancy in recent British working class history.</p>

<p>It is this that makes an understanding of the whole period so
important. At other times the British working class has seemed a
potentially revolutionary force but it has always been possible to
explain this away as a result of &#8216;special causes&#8217;. In the years
1800&#8211;1848 for example, the forces which contributed to the first
&#8216;making of the English working class&#8217; obviously derived in large
part from the transitional stresses of the industrial revolution.
Similarly the militancy of the years 1918&#8211;1921 (with its &#8216;nine-day
echo&#8217; in the General Strike) is in part explained by the
exceptional stress of the war. At all other times the record seems to
be one of the gradual &#8216;forward march&#8217; of a working class firmly
integrated into capitalism. Except that is for those four years
before the war when the hollowness of all the glib assumptions about
the passivity of ordinary people were exposed by a massive strike
wave which took place against a background of impeccably &#8216;normal&#8217; conditions.</p>

<p>But if the &#8216;labour unrest&#8217; cannot be explained away it can be
marginalised and diminished in stature. The very inadequacy of the
contemporary term &#8216;labour unrest&#8217; at once serves to isolate us
from a full understanding of these years and this has been reinforced
by historical treatment of the militancy.</p>

<p>For early moderate labour historians the revolt was essentially an
irrelevant byway on the road to the development of an orderly system
of industrial relations. The strikes were explained as an
overenthusiastic response to the economic cycle and the increase in
union membership by the encouragement given by the administrative
provisions of the 1911 National Insurance Act. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>
More recent work has completely marginalised the revolt by stressing
the continued vitality of liberalism in these years. With the Labour
Party very much its junior partner and able to win perhaps only a
dozen seats at most without an electoral alliance preventing liberals
standing against labour candidates the industrial militancy is
pictured as having no political consequences of significance. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p>Nor have the left wing historians challenged this picture. Rather
their emphasis on the &#8216;subordinate&#8217; character of the British
working class has reinforced it. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> The
only challenge to this has come from historians associated with the
forerunner of this Journal, James Hinton, Richard Hyman and Bob
Holton and this challenge has not been sustained Recently Hinton has
described his previous work as being concerned with &#8216;ghosts&#8217;
which presumably now need to be exorcised. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
It has therefore been left to two historians in America, at one
remove from the stultifying traditions of British labour history, to
insist both on the importance of these years and their wider
significance. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Sectionalism and the long downturn</h4>

<p class="fst"><a href="#t1">Table I</a> sets out the three basic government recorded strike series
for Britain from 1895 and the two averages that can be derived from
them. I have discussed the nature and limits of these statistics
elsewhere as well as how they compare with later periods and
internationally. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> Here our concern
will be to use them as an indicator of changing levels of militancy
and its contours.</p>

<p>It is immediately evident from Table I that the pre-war revolt was
preceded by a long period of downturn in levels of conflict. The
numbers of strikes fell, average size fell and strikes became longer
as workers had to fight harder for any gains or to defend existing
conditions. Our series starts when the 1888&#8211;1892 strike wave was
over and registers the bitter defensive battles that took place in a
number of industries in the 1890s. A home boom allowed some workers
such as those in building to push forward offensive demands and so
keep up the overall level of strike activity but after the turn of
the century the depth of the downturn became much more evident and
the number of strikes dropped to an all time low in peacetime years.

<p class="fst">The defensive character of unionism in these years is important
because it was at this time that many of the distinctive traits of
the labour movement were consolidated. Some left wing historians have
seen the period as one of an heroic battle against a general
capitalist offensive which, assisted by a number of adverse legal
decisions, finally culminated in the Taff Vale judgement. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>
But this is too simplistic. In areas like shipping and the docks
where conditions made it relatively easy to use blacklegs and the
services of William Collison&#8217;s strikebreaking National Free Labour
Association such an offensive is clearly evident. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>
But elsewhere what stands out is the acceptability of unions to
employers. What was at issue was rather the terms on which unions
should exist. Here it is becoming increasingly apparent that many
employers who were faced with unions saw them as double-edged. While
they might challenge employer prerogatives they could also hold back
and discipline workers as well. On this basis employers were prepared
to work with unions if the balance could be swung in their favour.
<a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> It was the need to tilt the
balance this way and not the desire to destroy unions that led to
major set piece confrontations in, for example, cotton in 1893, the
shoe industry in 1895 and, above all, engineering in 1897&#8211;1898. At
a national level the employers were spectacularly successful but on
the ground a degree of workplace power still remained. This was
particularly true in engineering where workers were still able to
exercise some degree of shop control. If Taff Vale is seen in this
light it too appears as a legal decision aimed at strengthening
&#8216;responsible trades unionism&#8217; which would respect contracts with employers.</p>

<p>Moreover a significant minority of union members were prepared to
consider accepting this view as well as the conciliation and
arbitration machinery which was increasingly sponsored by the Board
of Trade after the passing of the 1896 Conciliation Act. For a time
Ben Tillett and Tom Mann were both supporters of conciliation and
arbitration and over Taff Vale socialist unionists like George Earnes
of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE) wavered. In part this
is to be explained by the way that the union were being drawn into
uncharted seas but more significant is the way in which the downturn
in militancy in the 1890s had pulled whole sections of the labour
movement to the right in the absence of any strongly argued political
alternative. The result was that the inward and defensive character
of unionism came to be widely shared even on the left.</p>

<p>In this relative political isolation the basis of progress was
what Tillett later called &#8216;funds and sectional combination&#8217;. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a>
Unions would rely on their sectional strength and accumulated funds
which could maintain strikers in localised disputes. Obviously it was
only the craft unions which could operate in this way and the &#8216;new
unions&#8217; of the semi and unskilled tended to fall by the wayside
unless they too operated on craft lines, becoming &#8216;cautious,
limited, conservative and sectional. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p>Where these policies broke down was in the big confrontations such
as the 1898&#8211;98 engineering dispute. But no-one on the left was able
to generalise these experiences and workers remained trapped in what
W.F. Hay, a militant South Wales miner, called &#8216;the bow and arrow
stage trades unionism&#8217;. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> By the
end of 1909, therefore, only some 15% of the workforce was organised.
It is important to remember that this shift made the British trades
unions the most powerful in the world but that power was dissipated
across some 1100 different organisations.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The rise of a union bureaucracy</h4>

<p class="fst">The other side of the coin of this process of sectional
development was the emergence of a trade union bureaucracy in its own
right. There had, of course, been individual officials long before
but the growth of a class of officials was very uneven. In cotton,
for example, they had appeared at a relatively early stage but in
engineering the ASE had only a general secretary and a clerk as late
as 1866. In the next decades officialdom took root with the rise of
central and district officials. The ASE, for example, had a salaried
district staff from 1892. Insofar as we can generalise across a very
varied experience it does seem that officials were stronger the
weaker, more isolated and apathetic the union membership. Thus in
engineering strong shop control kept them in check while in building
their differentiation was much greater. But everywhere there was the
same common tendency towards a developing bureaucracy of officials
with their &#8216;two souls&#8217;.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we still lack an adequate account of this. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a>
Some officials used their positions spectacularly to their own
advantage. The early miners&#8217; leader Alexander MacDonald, for
example, made a modest fortune on the side, enjoying to the full the
high life of meetings with employers. William Abraham (Mabon) the
Welsh miners&#8217; leader earned &#163;700 a year at a time when the best
paid hewers would probably be earning no more than &#163;2 a week at most
and Abraham was also a director and company shareholder as well as a
landlord. In the cotton industry officials could earn &#163;250&#8211;&#163;300 a
year and it was a relative commonplace for them to later take
employment with the cotton masters. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>But these are extreme examples and the critique of the trade union
bureaucracy does not depend upon the effective bribery, sycophancy or
stupidity of officials. Rather this was a secondary consequence of
the growth of union officialdom. The majority were, no doubt,
&#8216;overworked and underpaid&#8217; and quite sincere in their beliefs and
actions. But this was precisely the problem, as one old engineer told
the Webbs, &#8216;Alas! It is not bribery. Not his morality but his
intellect is corrupted&#8217;. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p>This arose for a number of reasons. In the first place the
official was removed physically from the discipline of the workplace
and the conflicts of the workers. His own conditions were secure both
from particular workplace pressures and the general ups and downs of
the economy as a whole. Secondly, the development of collective
bargaining machinery gave officials a dual role of negotiating better
terms for their members and delivering the goods to management for
the duration of the agreement in terms of orderly workplace
relations. Anything that broke that routine therefore challenged
their credibility both in their own eyes and those of the management.
The degree of conservatism bred by collective bargaining machinery
varied considerably. Although by 1910 it covered only about a quarter
of the workforce these nevertheless included most trade unionists.
But the focus of this bargaining tended still to be local rather than
national &#8211; thus limiting to some extent the degree of detachment of
officials from their members.</p>

<p>Even so, the tension in the officials position was apparent
everywhere and it was reinforced by outside influences. The Webbs
well understood how these pressures worked, &#8216;the officials of the
great societies found themselves elected to School boards and even to
the House of Commons, pressed by the Government to accept seats on
Royal Commissions and respectfully listened to in the lobby&#8217;. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>
<p>It is interesting that the integration of ex-officials into the
state was particularly pronounced. Typical was John Burnett who had
made his reputation leading the &#8216;9 hours movement&#8217; in the
North-East in 1871&#8211;2. He later became secretary of the ASE and from
1886 Labour Correspondent of the Board of Trade. But he was just one
of many and as state functions increased so did the tendency to draw
in union officials. By 1912, for example, one estimate suggests that
&#8216;nearly 400&#8217; posts created by the liberal government in the
factory inspectorate, Home Office, Board of Trade and National
Insurance administration had been filled by trade unionists. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>
<p>These widespread pressures to contain the unions did not, however,
go unchallenged. The Board of Trade in the early 1890s, using a very
generous definition of &#8216;official strikes&#8217;, found that over a
quarter of the strikes they surveyed had not been approved for
various reasons. More interestingly still these strikes tended to be
larger on average than approved ones. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a>
What gave these struggles their importance is that they arose out of
informal workplace organisation and an attempt by workers to maintain
the &#8216;frontier of control&#8217;. We know most about these struggles in
engineering and building but scattered evidence from other industries
which has yet to be drawn together shows them clearly to have
extended far beyond these two industries. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a>
The problem was how could they be built upon?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Workers in revolt</h4>

<p class="fst">If we turn back now to <a href="#t1">Table I</a> and focus on the years 1910&#8211;1914
we can see the dynamics of the strike wave in action. The number of
strikes reached a peak in 1913 and on average in these years strikes
were running at twice the level of the previous five years. The
number of strikers and strike-days peaked in 1912 because of the
national coalmining dispute that year. Over the period as a whole
there were 4.5 times more strikers than the previous five years and
just under 4 times as many strike-days. The dimensions of individual
strikes changed too. Column four shows that the average size of
strike grew. Column five reflects indirectly the way in which strikes
paid off. The average length of strikes fell, especially in 1911, as
workers&#8217; militancy brought them quicker gains and intimidated
employers (the increase in 1912 is largely accounted for by the
national coal strike).</p>

<p>These broad dimensions are probably common to all strike waves but
the previous ones had taken place in the pre-statistical age.
Obviously earlier strike waves were absolutely smaller but it is also
possible that they were relatively smaller too (except for the very
earliest ones which started from a small base). But more significant
than mere quantitative comparison is, the way in which the strikes in
this era differed qualitatively from what had occurred before.</p>

<p>In the first place these strikes were not contained within the
existing union organisations. Rather they were a dual revolt against
employers and the established union leaderships and collective
bargaining machinery where it existed. It was these aspects that gave
them their second characteristic, namely violence and aggression.
This was reflected not only in the extensive overt violence against
blacklegs, employers and magistrates as well as in the sabotage of
machinery but also in the way in which working class self-confidence
came to have a belligerent character. In the Black Country in 1913,
for example, strikers marched from factory to factory singing with
considerable intimidation what became their theme song &#8216;Hello,
hello, here we are again&#8217;. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a> The
second factor spilt over into a third distinguishing characteristic &#8211;
the strikes came to represent an implicit challenge to the existing
political system. This was only in part a conscious revolt against
parliament. Rather it reflected a deeper challenge to the restrictive
limits of political activity in Edwardian Britain. At a time when
playing street football was a major &#8216;crime&#8217; of working class
youth the willingness of strikers to engage in street politics, to
march at a moments notice several miles to bring out another factory
served to challenge the closely circumscribed limits of what was
acceptable. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a> And for a few this did
indeed then develop and link into a more conscious and coherent
critique of the nature of the political system.</p>

<p>The detailed history of the major disputes and the related
increase in union membership can be found elsewhere. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a>
Here we will be content to note the bare outlines in order to look
more closely at the characteristics of the whole revolt. The first
phase of open militancy ran from September 1910 to August 1911 and
centred on the South Wales coal held with a mass refusal to accept
the terms negotiated by the union leadership. Eventually the miners
were forced back but not before violent clashes had shaken the
Rhondda and burned the name Tonypandy into Welsh working class
consciousness. Between June and September 1911 the focus switched to
transport strikes, first with the conflicts in the ports which
stopped Hull and Liverpool and then spilling over into national
railway strike. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a> On August 15 two
men were shot dead in Liverpool and a few days later two more were
shot dead in Llanelli.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1911&#8211;1912 the focus switched back to mining
with a crippling national strike that involved 93% of all coalworkers
closing 87% of all blast furnaces within 5 weeks and seriously
hitting rail transport after only 3 weeks. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a>
In the spring and early summer attention turned back to transport
again with a crucial dock strike in London at the fore. The defeat of
this strike was a major setback. Sympathy action in other ports,
which had been expected but not planned, did not materialise and the
strikers in London were left isolated. For a time the momentum of the
strike seemed to waver but then in 1913 it surged back once again.
There were renewed strikes on the railways and in the mines but more
notable was the spread of strike activity into new areas: the
&#8216;prairie fire&#8217; strikes in the Black Country engineering and metal
working industry and new conflicts in building. At the same time in
Dublin James Larkin was leading a strike which paralysed and
polarised the city. In the end 656 workers were jailed, and 5 killed
in what was a mini-civil war which threatened religious divisions as
both catholic and protestant workers faced what James Connolly later
called &#8216;an alliance of Dublin Castle with its police, the
Orange-Tory magistrates, Nationalist employers and the Catholic
hierarchy&#8217;. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p>Larkin&#8217;s own position as a strike leader often reflected a sharp
divorce between his &#8216;theory&#8217; and practice but his denunciation of
the Labour Party leaders as being as &#8216;useful as mummies in a
museum&#8217; and the TUC as &#8216;fools who mask as leaders&#8217; was one that
many strikers came to share through their own experience. And his
basic advice to &#8216;never trust leaders  ...  trust yourselves&#8217; was
an attitude which typified the militancy of this time. It was an
attitude, moreover, which carried the wave of strikes forward to the
outbreak of war in 1914. As Table I shows in the first seven months
of 1914 strikes were running at a record level with a major building
strike in London now capturing most attention. To many worried
observers it seemed as if in the autumn things were bound to get
hotter still.</p>

<p>Equally significant was the development of union organisation.
Membership increased by some 60% and union density rose 23% in 1914.
Anti-union tactics which had been maintained successfully for two
decades in industries like shipping and the railways were simply
blown away. In 1910, for example, only a third of railway workers
were organised. By 1914 the figure was three quarters. But
organisation spread far more widely taking the first significant
inroads among white collar workers and bringing in unskilled workers
to a far greater extent than in the 1888&#8211;1892 &#8216;new unionism&#8217;
period. The Gasworkers and General Labourers Union increased its
membership from 32,000 in 1910 to 135,000 by the end 1913. In the
same period the Workers&#8217; Union increased its membership from 5 to 91,000.</p>

<p>But it was not simply organisation. The strikes were also a revolt
against traditional union forms &#8211; against bureaucratic leadership
and sectional organisation. Amalgamation committees led from below
sprang up, often opposed by union leaders and with at best usually no
more than lukewarm support. Perhaps the greatest success was the
partial break with sectionalism on the railways which led to the
formation of the National Union of Railwaymen, &#8216;a triumph of
industrial unionism&#8217;, and then in 1914 came the formal attempt to
link the action of 1.5 million miners, transport workers and railway
men in the Triple Alliance. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p>Of course the wave of militancy did not sweep everything before
it. 75% of the workforce remained outside of the unions and
sectionalism and bureaucracy continued to exist and worked to subvert
the gains of these years. But two decades of union, growth had been
compressed into four years and diverted towards the less skilled and
the old ways had been thrown heavily on the defensive.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Strikes and consciousness</h4>

<p class="fst">The revolt of these years cannot be explained without reference to
economic, social and organisational pressures. But either by
themselves or together this range of explanation is inadequate. Real
wages had been falling as prices had risen while at a more general
level the increasing size of capitalist organisation and a new
intensity of work reinforced the pressures on workers. Then in
1910&#8211;1914 unemployment fell sharply creating the basic conditions
for militancy. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a> But the militancy
went far beyond a simple response to changed conditions to develop a
momentum of its own. The rising level of struggle produced a sharp
polarisation, on the one hand between workers and employers and the
state and on the other between the workers and their official
leaderships whether in the unions or the Labour party. The ideology
of labourism was not destroyed but it was thrown back on its heels.
As one militant mason wrote in 1912 &#8216;we know something about the
men who are going to rebuild our Society (union) if it gets rebuilt,
but those men are not officials ...  The trade union movement is bled
white by officialdom&#8217;. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p>This changing consciousness was far from coherent and it involved
more than just &#8216;a sense of impending clash&#8217;. Its tangibility can
be felt in a number of ways. At its most class conscious level it can
be found in the increasing precision of the militants argument which
can be traced in journals like <strong>The Industrial Syndicalist</strong>, <strong>The
Syndicalist</strong> and most notably in the classic pamphlet of the time
&#8211; <strong>The Miners&#8217; Next Step</strong>.</p>

<p>At a broader level it can be found too in the character of the
strikers demands. Holton points out that in the South Wales coal
dispute the strike committee began by calling on workers to &#8216;Down
Tools&#8217; in support of higher wages and ended by calling on them &#8216;To
put an end to Capitalist Despotism and do battle for the cause of
Industrial Freedom&#8217;. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> But Such a
progression was by no means unusual. Three years later the strikes in
the Black Country began over simple wages issues but quickly brought
in other elements that threatened to go beyond this: As One worker
said &#8216;he was looking forward to the time when there would be one
union for every man in England. Something was going to happen that
would shake the foundation of the Midlands&#8217;. Union leaders who were
opposed to strike action had to chase after strikers and begin to
talk too of &#8216;class conflict&#8217; in order to retain their credibility
with the workers. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>Strike committees and militants can, of course, frequently run
ahead of the feelings of the mass of strikers, particularly near the
end of a dispute. At these times the sloganising becomes more shrill
and no doubt this often happened in these years. But what is
interesting and different is the extent to which strikers kept up a
high level of activity and a high visibility creating a stronger
unity than before. Mass picketing was a commonplace, daily strike
meetings, frequent demonstrations led by brass bands in a carnival
atmosphere and often directed against specific targets like factories
still working, street collections and so on. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a>
Thus in the South Wales dispute although the men were forced back in
August 1911 on terms they could have had the previous autumn
militancy nevertheless recovered &#8211; a feature which is typical of
this period. In these terms the analysis of strike demands and their
relationship to changing attitude must be taken seriously in any
assessment of what was happening. But the most concrete evidence of
changing consciousness can be found in the record of strikes itself.</p>

<p>For contemporaries the most notable aspect of the explosion of
consciousness was the sympathetic strike. In fact between 1911 and
1913 the Board of Trade only recognised 37 genuine sympathetic
strikes involving only 25,733 workers. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a>
The real change in the character of strike profiles has to be
measured less formally than this. One important manifestation was the
explicit linking of strike demands of different groups which tied
together the skilled and the less skilled. This was particularly
evident in the transport disputes. But below this we find a new sense
of confidence spreading through informal channels. These links
particularly benefited those workers in parts of industry which had
never been able to strike before. Here the victories of the strong
gave new courage to the weak. One indication of this is the way in
which strike length changed. As Table I shows the average length of
strikes fell but this was not evenly distributed across all strikes.
In particular in the very smallest disputes the fall was most
dramatic. For example, in 1908&#8211;1910 strikes involving less than 25
workers averaged 24.1 days but in 1911&#8211;1913 they averaged only 10.4
days. Similarly those involving less than 100 Workers averaged
respectively 23.8 and 12.9 days in the two periods. Since workers
were winning more gains in these years it is highly unlikely that
this is accountable for by small unsuccessful strikes though even a
new willingness to go on strike and be defeated would be an important
sign. This new confidence also affected the duration of strikes in
other ways. Between 1905&#8211;1909 39% of strikes lasted less than a
week and 71% less than a month. In the strike wave 46% were settled
in a week and 80% in a month. At the other end of the scale 4.7% of
strikes lasted more than 20 weeks in 1905&#8211;1909 but only 2.45% in 1910&#8211;1913.</p>

<p>What is being registered here is not only a change in workers
attitudes but also a loss of employer confidence. The Board of Trade
also kept a record of the results of strikes. This could hardly be
objective but it is useful as an index of attitudes. It clearly shows
a close relationship between the number of claimed employers
victories and the total level of strike activity &#8211; the more strikes
the fewer victories the employers claimed. Thus in this period we see
a sharp fall in the percentage of employer victories and a
significant increase in the number of &#8216;compromises&#8217; that were struck.</p>

<p>The strike profile changed in one other way which is crucial. The
new confidence fed into action by women workers on a significant
scale. In 1911, for example, in Bermondsey some 15,000 women in the
sweated trades came out and they were soon followed by charwomen
working for the London County Council. In the Black Country in 1913
too women played a prominent role encouraged by the early successes
of men (Lord Askwith&#8217;s account has misled many into thinking it was
women who set off these strikes). Union organisation was also
extended among women by 54% in these years. This was slightly less
than amongst men but it was still significant in that it created a
credible base for women&#8217;s trade unionism for the first time in a
number of work places.</p>

<p>These moves did not break entrenched attitudes overnight. A
women&#8217;s organiser of the Workers&#8217; Union, for example, partly
pandering to male prejudices, told strikers in Walsall that
&#8216;unorganised women were a real menace, and it was because the men
workers have looked down on them that women have encroached on
industries&#8217;. But chinks appeared and were beginning to be prised
open. In the history of the National Union of Boot and Shoe
Operatives, for example, we find the intriguing case of Lizzie
Wilson, a Leicester militant. Shining through the bemused contempt of
the union&#8217;s historian comes the story of a woman who led a struggle
to change union attitudes to its women members, in 1910&#8211;1911,
condemning the leadership as being incapable of dealing &#8216;with the
needs of the members of present day, especially women ...&#8217; In the
end she was driven to lead a revolt which led to the creation of an
alternative women&#8217;s union in the area which apparently lasted until
the 1930s. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> No doubt there were
other such cases but until historians take these years more seriously
the story behind this and other episodes will remain unknown.</p>

<p>In the four years 1910&#8211;1913 somewhere between 25 and 30% of the
workforce went on strike according to the official statistics. This
was a major transformation but it still left a further 70&#8211;75% who
did not strike. No doubt amongst these were a hard core of workers
who remained indifferent to the challenge of the time. But to judge
the revolt like this is misleading. In the first place many strikes
were not included in the statistics because they were not considered
serious enough. Equally some strikes were strategic and victory in
them enabled other workers to make significant gains without
themselves going on strike. But more important than either of these
points is the way in which the strikes that did take place fed upon
and fed into a growing opposition based in the working class
community as well as in the factory.</p>

<p>Reactions to strikes very often became community reactions not
only because strikers were from these communities but because a
related dynamic of community protest linked into industrial struggle.
A major tangible grievance, for example, that has been insufficiently
discussed was rents. The Black Country strikes were preceded by what
landlords and the local press chose to call a &#8216;Tenants War&#8217;
against rent rises and this problem similarly affected other areas.
The result was that strikes developed into &#8216;riots&#8217; such as those
which shook Tonypandy in 1910. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a> In
Hull and Liverpool too the working class community was involved in
attacking police and attempting to rescue arrested strikers, bringing
together both catholics and protestants at the same time. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a>
The strikers themselves assisted this process by not being afraid to
take their demands into the communities, holding house to house
collections and evening meetings to gather support. All of this
therefore acted to involve those who were not on strike, other
workers, women at home and even in 1911 a rash of strikes by
schoolchildren. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a> And when the state
reacted with violence this only served to intensify solidarity
against what was seen as a hostile force whether represented on the
ground by troops or the police.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Crisis and the state</h4>

<p class="fst">But the nature of crisis cannot only be discussed in terms of one
side. We have also to look at how the ruling class, through the
state, failed to resolve the problems it faced in these years. Before
1914 governments did not have a coherent policy towards &#8216;industrial
relations&#8217;. Only the Board of Trade worked consistently,
encouraging &#8216;responsible bargaining&#8217; but aiming at the same time
to keep the State at one remove from strikes. The revolt strained
these designs to breaking point. The Board of Trade was overwhelmed
by the immensity of the strikes and time and again its chief
conciliator George Askwith was brought in at the last moment to
resolve conflict. For a time he became almost a folk hero dashing
through the night from one crisis to another. When the South African
government asked to borrow his talents the British government refused
because it could not afford for him to be out of the country for so long.</p>

<p>Where Askwith was not sufficient government ministers tried their
hand but in the succession of crises such interventions worked to
diminishing effect. The way in which control threatened to be lost is
powerfully illustrated by the way in which the repressive face of the
state was brought to the fore. A Royal Commission in 1908 had
recommended against the use of troops in strikes but they were soon
widely in use. At first they reinforced the local police and the
Metropolitan Police whose task it was to act as the <em>first</em> line
national back-up in a crisis. Then in August of 1911 Churchill
ordered the troops in to do the strikers work in the transport
strikes of that month. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p>The sensitivity on this issue was shown by the prosecution of Tom
Mann and others for issuing a leaflet calling on troops not to shoot
on strikers. The crisis was most acute in August 1911, panic seized
local government as transport ground to a halt. Troops were
dispatched to over 30 towns and opened fire in Liverpool, Llanelli
and London. Territorial Army weapons were immobilised or removed in a
number of places for fear they would be turned on regular troops by
strikers or their sympathisers. Although the worst panic only lasted
a few days its seriousness is often not understood. Almost every home
based regiment was mobilised and on August 19th army officers were
given the right to deploy their men independent of civilian control. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p>If this military crisis passed the general problems for the state
did not. The crucial issue was the ambiguity of &#8216;collective
bargaining&#8217;. Under the pressure of the unrest union recognition
spread and formal collective bargaining machinery was extended. But
worried contemporaries did not see this as it was later seen as &#8216;the
great social invention that has institutionalised industrial
conflict&#8217;. One of the more intelligent contemporary attempts to
assess the strike wave concluded that &#8216;bargaining cannot abolish
strikes and lock-outs any more than diplomacy can abolish war&#8217;.
<a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a> The problem was that control of
this machinery did not lie securely in the hands of the national
leaderships of the unions. Most collective bargaining remained local
opening up the possibilities of militants using it to their own
advantage. This &#8216;rank and filism&#8217; was not widely theorised but it
was no less real for that. It did, however, inform <strong>The Miner&#8217;s
Next Step</strong> which marked a major advance in the attitudes of
militants to their unions. This started from the assumption that &#8216;so
long as the system of working for wages endures, collective
bargaining remains essential&#8217; but then went on to explore how rank
and file militancy could push it in favour of the workers. The
problem with the analysis in the pamphlet was that it placed
excessive reliance on bringing union leaderships to heel rather than
building an alternative leadership in the mines and factories, whilst
still working within the existing unions. But even with this
important limitation the problem of control was still a very real
one. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a></p>

<p>An important expression of this was the increasing scepticism
about conciliation and arbitration machinery. In fact in these years
the whole machinery of conciliation and arbitration set up by the
state was dangerously exposed. The spread of conciliation was
effectively halted as a means of resolving disputes. The extent to
which this occurred has been obscured by the fact that in one
industry there was a massive increase in conciliation cases making it
look as if the total number of cases rose dramatically, but in
reality there was hardly any increase at all elsewhere. At the same
time in major conflicts the success of conciliation came to depend
heavily on the personal qualities of Sir George Askwith &#8211; obviously
a dangerously narrow base to depend on. Moreover it was not just the
workers who came to doubt the value of this machinery. By 1913
employers too were beginning to look for stronger solutions. The
difficulties were symbolised when Sir Charles Macara who was a
leading member of the Industrial Council &#8211; a body designed to bring
employers and unions together to restore harmony &#8211; suddenly
appeared as the intransigent leader of the cotton employers in the
lock-out of Lancashire cotton workers. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p>Again these basic problems were clear to many contemporaries:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>it is notorious that the machinery of the present
(Conciliation) Act ...  has proved altogether inapplicable in most of
the more widespread of recent labour troubles ...  the parties to
such disputes have shown no readiness to agree upon arbitration. The
Board of Trade has therefore been compelled in such cases, to fall
back on its vaguer powers under the Act ...  a power which, it need
hardly be said, has failed to be efficacious in some of the gravest
emergencies.</em> <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There was thus a basic ambiguity in the response to the
institutions designed to contain the workers militancy. Very often
the militancy pushed through these limits and a minority of militants
began to see at least part of the way in which these actions could be
taken further. The Triple Alliance well illustrates this. In one
sense it was no more than a simple extension of trade unionism
designed to increase pressure on the state and hold the militants in
check. In these terms it was &#8216;the cripple alliance&#8217; from the very
outset. But it also had another side which the militants fought for
and before the war it was not obvious that the officials would
succeed in using the Triple Alliance to divert action rather than
lead it.</p>

<p>For the state this was precisely the problem. The pragmatic policy
that emerged was one of co-opting union leaders. In May 1911
Churchill could on this basis encourage union membership, &#8216;I
consider that every workman is well advised to join a trade union&#8217;.
But rank and file protest undercut this process and in 1912 Buxton
from the Board of Trade had to report to the Cabinet that &#8216;the
leaders have lost influence and consequently self-confidence, and
naturally are unwilling to take the same responsibility as they would
gladly have taken, and did take, under former conditions&#8217;, it took
the first world war itself to consolidate this integration of the
union leaderships into the state itself. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The failure of the left</h4>

<p class="quoteb"><em>The trade union leaders, almost to a man, deplored it,
the government viewed it with alarm, the ILP regretted this untoward
disregard for the universal panacea of the ballot box, the SDF asked
&#8216;Can anything be more foolish, more harmful, more ...  unsocial
than a strike&#8217;; yet disregarding everything, encouraged only by a
small minority of syndicalist leaders, the great strike wave rolled
on, threatening to sweep everything away before it.</em> <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a></p>

<p class="fst">History abounds with missed opportunities but unfortunately they
too often exist only in the mind of the historian. Yet some stand
out, and the years 1910&#8211;1914 have a serious claim on our attention
in these terms. How was it that the left was unable to capitalise on
this tide of revolt?</p>

<p>On the eve of the &#8216;labour unrest&#8217; the left consisted of three
main organisations. The oldest and most radical was the Social
Democratic Federation. This was a &#8216;Marxist&#8217; organisation but of a
very peculiar kind &#8211; Second International Marxism mediated by the
foibles of its founder, financier and still dominant personality,
H.M. Hyndman. <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a> In spite of many
difficulties it had survived a number of breakaways and in 1909 had a
membership of some 10,000 plus. Alongside it stood the more moderate
Independent Labour Party founded in 1893 and now with some 30,000
members. The ILP was in theory a socialist organisation but its
leaders had always been prepared to subordinate their socialism to
the task of winning seats in parliament. This led them to act as the
midwife to the founding of the Labour Representation Committee in
1901. When candidates of the LRC won 29 seats in the 1906 elections
the basis for a viable parliamentary Labour Party was created.</p>

<p>But the cost of this electoral success was high. To the extent
that it existed socialism was now subject to a double subordination.
Unlike on the continent the early socialists were faced with an
already strong trades union and co-operative movement. They therefore
had the choice of trying to win it over to socialism or compromising
their socialism and trying to come to some sort of arrangement with
it. In terms of winning a parliamentary victory the second road
seemed to offer a short cut and the ILP leaders jumped at it. For
their part the trades unions, holding the purse strings, were happy
to tolerate the occasional piece of socialist rhetoric in the
narrower interests of using parliamentary representation as a
pressure to win limited legislative gains &#8211; most notably the
reversal of the Taff Vale judgement. It was in these terms that Keir
Hardie and others constructed their &#8216;Labour Alliance&#8217;. But there
was also a second element of subordination to a sometimes secret,
sometimes open alliance with Liberalism. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a>
Again this was dictated by the belief that it offered a short cut to
parliamentary influence, if not power.</p>

<p>There were important differences between the SDF, the ILP and the
Labour Party in parliament though a concentration on the leaders and
formal ideologies has obscured many instances of cooperation between
local branches. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a> But for the
purposes of understanding their role in the years 1910&#8211;1914,
however, it is what they have in common that is important. Here the
most significant point is their common focus on parliamentary and
local government elections. This meant that not only were they
committed ideologically to parliamentary methods but their structures
had developed to support this commitment. As a result they were
ill-fitted to respond to a strike wave whose very essence was
extra-parliamentary and whose militants openly denounced parliament
as a charade.</p>

<p>In this they were not, of course, alone. The European left
generally was trapped in this framework and although there were
important differences between the social democratic parties of Europe
the particular weaknesses of the British left encapsulate in this
sense the general weaknesses of the European left before 1914. The
one major exception to this was to be found in Russia. There the
repressive policies of the Tsarist state meant that &#8216;the social
democratic model of a broad mass party representing the whole of the
working class was simply impossible. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a>
Instead the Bolsheviks were forced to organise in the workplace
rather than on the geographical lines of parliamentary
constituencies. Politically too the depression imposed a much greater
unity and made the party a more homogeneous working class one. At the
same time there was no layer of functionaries at the top whose power
depended upon either trade union or parliamentary position. Instead
leadership depended more on the ability to convince members of the
correctness of actions and politics. Thus prior to 1917 the practice
of Bolshevism had already emerged even if the theory still awaited
its final completion. But much of the theory was there too in
outline. Already Lenin and those around him had begun to see these
elements as having a merit in themselves and not just to be shrugged
off once a parliamentary system was created.</p>

<p>It was this that separated them from other groups on the left in
Russia and in Europe more generally. It is obviously foolish to
idealise the coherence of a party structure that had to operate in
the chaotic conditions of the Tsarist Empire but the significance of
the break that the Bolsheviks had made in political organisation and
their ability to link political and economic struggled was apparent
with hindsight before 1917. In fact between 1912 and 1914 they were
able to use a strike wave to gain a commanding position amongst
Russia&#8217;s small but militant working class and so succeeding where
the British left failed.</p>

<p>But the ways in which the SDF, ILP and Labour Party developed were
also self-defeating even in their own more limited terms. Not only
did the focus on parliament mean that they were subject to all of the
pressures that social democratic parties are normally subject to. It
also meant that their appeal was effectively emasculated by the
parliamentary system itself. The problem here was that the franchise
operated in such a way as to exclude some 70% of all adults (it was
one of the narrowest in the whole of Europe). On top of this
electoral boundaries were drawn in such a way as to minimise the
number of working class constituencies while the costs of winning
seats in &#8216;the best club in Europe&#8217; imposed huge financial strains
that could not help but affect the way in which the parties were
organised. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a></p>

<p>Access to parliament was seen as being necessary in order to
implement state control or &#8216;collectivism&#8217;. Again they suffered
here from the general failure of social democratic parties to come to
terms with the nature of the capitalist state. But the failure was
compounded too by the consequent inability to make contact with the
widespread and deeply ingrained tradition of working class hostility
to the state. There was thus a basic barrier between what socialists
advocated and the instinctive reactions of ordinary people. <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a></p>

<p>This problem was simply explained away in terms of the blindness
of the working class to what was being offered them. For their part
the parties were equally blind to working class actions such as
strikes, a politically &#8216;disruptive&#8217; activity to which they were
indifferent and at worst opposed. With largely middle class
memberships they were a part of the labour movement but they did not
organise within it. In fact many socialists went further in that they
shared a deep and ill-concealed contempt for ordinary people who were
too &#8216;stupid&#8217; to recognise the abstract attraction of their
socialism &#8211; an attitude typified in Robert Tressell&#8217;s novel <strong>The
Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</strong>. Organisationally too they had
much in common in that they were all bureaucratically centralised
with only limited internal democracy. In practice this meant that
decisions were hard to enforce, with the result that the branches
were constantly pulled in different directions by their own
memberships. <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a></p>

<p>But this was obscured as were the oligarchic cliques running them
by another shared characteristic &#8211; namely their moralistic concern
with socialism as a form of abstract propaganda. This at one and the
same time pulled them together as organisations and isolated them
from the cold realities of the world. Behind it socialism could
become &#8216;a milch-cow to those who made careers through it, a ladder
to bureaucratic jobs outside, or a comforting ideology for
professional intellectuals&#8217;. <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a></p>

<p>There is a tendency to imply that there was a certain
inevitability about the way in which these characteristics developed.
But what is interesting is the recurrent history of revolt against
these traditions. The early days of the SDF, for example, were marked
by William Morris&#8217;s objections to the parliamentarism of Hyndman.
In the ILP in the early 1890s Hardie&#8217;s conception of the &#8216;Labour
Alliance&#8217; had to overcome the arguments of Tom Mann and others that
any serious socialist party should be equally opposed to Liberalism
and Toryism and see work in the trade unions as one of its main
tasks. Again in the late 1900s various opposition currents emerged in
both of these organisations. Sometimes the desire was only to make
them more effective in their own terms but again some began to
question the terms on which they had been built. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a></p>

<p>None of these critiques were fully developed with the result that
there tended to be an oscillation between temporary sharp internal
criticism before differences were sunk in the wider interests of the
party or movement and an attempt to maintain purity through extreme
sectarianism such as that found in the Socialist Labour Party &#8211; a
breakaway from the SDF. As a result the left entered the strike wave
without any organisation capable of capitalising on it. Instead it
was out of the failure to come to terms with the strikes that the
elements of the questioning of the existing forms began to come
together prefiguring parts of the model which existed, as yet
unknown, in Russia though without ever completing it before 1914.</p>

<h4 class="western">The Labour party, the ILP, and the BSP</h4>

<p class="fst">The scale and unofficial character of the revolt struck at the
very heart of the carefully constructed alliances on which the Labour
Party was based. MPs found themselves faced with the choice of
defending the officials whose unions paid them or supporting the
actions of the workers whose support they rhetorically invoked. To
his credit Keir Hardie chose the later path though his actions were
often less radical than his words, &#8216;syndicalism&#8217;, he declared,
&#8216;is the direct outcome of the apathy and indifference of this House
towards working class questions, and I rejoice at the growth of
syndicalism&#8217;. <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a> But the rest of
the party many of whom were current or former union leaders remained
Silent. And when the silence was broken it was only to lecture
strikers. In 1911 Arthur Henderson and three other labour MPs
proposed a bill to make strikes illegal without 30 days notice. But
at least they allowed for strikes. Phillip Snowden, known for his
radicalism as the &#8216;English Robespierre&#8217;, came out against strikes
at all in the labour press and in a more qualified way in his book
<strong>Socialism or Syndicalism</strong>. <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a>
The value of outbursts like these as a weapon with which to attack
strikers was not lost on the press. Snowden&#8217;s condemnation of
syndicalism was published just as the 1913 strike wave was gathering
momentum in the Midlands. His argument was immediately taken up by
the local press:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>Mr Snowden&#8217;s writings have frequently given us the
impression that he has become a great deal more impressed since he
entered Parliament by the wisdom of things as they are ...  We are
quite at one with Mr Snowden in his condemnation of Syndicalism and
the General Strike.</em> <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a></p>

<p>The fact that the Labour Party was acting as a bulwark of the
existing order was not just a figment of the militants&#8217;
imagination. Lloyd George saw its role in exactly these terms.
&#8216;Socialism&#8217;, he said, meaning the Labour Party, would destroy
&#8216;Syndicalism&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;the best policeman for the Syndicalist is
the Socialist&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>there is this guarantee for society, that one microbe
can be trusted to kill another, and the microbe of Socialism, which
may be a very beneficient one, does at any rate keep guard upon the
other, which is a very dangerous and perilous one. I have, therefore,
no real fear of the Syndicalist.</em> <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These positions accentuated the emerging crisis in the ILP and the
other groups that made up the grass roots of the Labour Party. One
indication of this is the failure of socialist and co-operative
society affiliation to the Labour party to grow. Between 1905&#8211;1910
membership in this category rose by 85% but in the years 1910&#8211;1914
it rose by only 7%. Behind these figures lies the particular problem
of the ILP. During these years, says its historian, the Party
&#8216;appeared irrelevant and tired&#8217;. Its ideological standing
diminished, the circulation of the Labour Leader declined and finally
a significant minority of rank and file members broke away. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a></p>

<p>One expression of this paralysis was the way in which many
intellectuals moved to a fundamental questioning of the nature of
parliamentary socialism. While the columns of the Daily Herald from
1912 gave such people a wider platform which was used for bitter
political and personal attacks on the labour leadership they tended
in their own politics to support a proliferating number of marginal
and utopian groups. GDH Cole was typical in trying to subvert the
Fabian Society &#8216;to permeate the permeators&#8217; in order to create an
&#8216;intelligence department&#8217; for the labour movement and a purged
Labour party led by, amongst others, Phillip Snowden! <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a></p>

<p>Rank and file opposition, by contrast, did have a practical edge
to it and it came to a head in 1911. Under the impact of their own
quickening radicalisation and the pressure of socialists like Victor
Grayson, a dissident group led particularly by Leonard Hall (who had
been an ILP member since its foundation) finally despaired of
changing the ILP. A measure of the significance of their loss can be
seen in the consequent decline in ILP branches in <a href="#t2">Table II</a>. It is
evident too in the decline in affiliation fees which slumped by 25%
between 1910&#8211;1912 and a further 11% between 1912&#8211;1914. <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a></p>

<p>The dissident ILPers left to join the British Socialist Party
(BSP) which was an attempt to bring together all those groups to the
left of the ILP. In the autumn of 1911 a Socialist Unity Conference
was held in Salford with over 200 delegates including 41 from ILP
branches and 86 from SDF branches and then in May 1912 the founding
conference of the BSP was held. The new party thus drew together the
old SDF with an amalgam of local socialist groups and the former ILP
members. The latter represented a developing critique which centred
on support for industrial action against parliamentary action. The
Manifesto of the Birmingham section of the BSP spoke of &#8216;the
machine gun action of all vast armies of Labour organised as a
national, union of all workers in all industries&#8217;. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a>

At the unity conference it was claimed that 35,000 socialists were
represented and the founding conference of the BSP claimed to
represent 40,000 members. These figures have been widely quoted but
they were probably exaggerated. However, even if only half that
number were genuinely represented the BSP still presented a
potentially formidable, force.</p>

<p>Unfortunately within a year the promise had disappeared. The
problem lay not so much with Hall and the ex-ILP contingent as the
old SDF which still made up the core of the BSP. Under the pressure
of the unrest the old leaders around Hyndman had begun to move to the
left in their rhetoric but all of the ambiguities towards strikes,
parliament and even nationalism remained. It did not take long for
them to come out. When Hall tried to get full support for the
industrial revolt he could only muster a third of conference support
in 1912. After this the old guard came out in the open rehearsing
increasingly right-wing arguments on nationalism and above all
opposing strikes:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>All workers, whether they like it or not, are
consumers as well as producers, citizens as well as wage earners ... 
Any policy failing to act upon this must be a disruptive agency, at a
time when working class consolidation is crucial.</em> <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a></p>

<p class="fst">For the militants this was the last straw and they began to drift
away. With them went the hope that it was possible to turn the
existing political organisations into fighting alternatives. The
logic was now for the BSP to liquidate itself given that as a
parliamentary organisation the Labour party was obviously more
effective and this is just what happened. In 1914 the BSP applied to
affiliate to the Labour party and it was finally accepted in 1916.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Syndicalism</h4>

<p class="fst">Outside of the ILP and the BSP the most important political
expression of the workers militancy was the syndicalist movement. The
leading force behind syndicalism was Tom Mann helped by a small
number of able publicists and militant rank and file workers like
Noah Ablett a South Wales militant and part author of <strong>The Miners&#8217;
Next Step</strong>. Mann had begun to publish <strong>The Industrial
Syndicalist</strong> after he returned from Australia in 1910. This was a
monthly for direct action and 11 in all were published. The first
issues fell on fertile ground and in December 1910 the Industrial
Syndicalist Education League (ISEL) was set up. Syndicalist influence
continued to grow though 1911 and 1912 encouraging both the militancy
and the splits in the ILP that we have discussed. <strong>The Industrial
Syndicalist</strong> ceased publication at the height of the strikes in
1911 and Mann replaced it with the Liverpool based <strong>Transport
Worker</strong>. Then in December 1911 the first edition of <strong>The
Miners&#8217; Next Step</strong> was published only to be sold out within
three months.</p>

<p>In 1912 the ground seemed even more promising. In January
publication of <strong>The Syndicalist</strong> began and then in the spring a
massive boost came first, from the arrest of Mann and Bowman over
their <em>Don&#8217;t Shoot</em> leaflet issued to troops, then the
national coal strike and finally the publication of the Daily Herald
which had begun as a printers strike sheet. During the summer of
1912, <strong>The Syndicalist</strong> had a circulation of 20,000. The
culmination came in the Autumn when the ISEL conference drew together
delegates from unions, trade councils and rank and file amalgamation
committees representing a claimed 100,000 workers. Their purpose was
to unify syndicalism and create a more coherent and effective
organisation. &#8216;The 1912&#8211;13 reorganisation of the ISEL represented
the highpoint of formal organisational cohesion within the
syndicalist movement before the war&#8217;. <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a></p>

<p>Yet within months the ISEL too had splintered and syndicalism as a
movement fragmented. The split came on the issue of reorganising
existing unions or creating new dual unions. Except in the short-run
the latter position has always proved disastrous in Europe but its
apparent success in America gave it sufficient credibility for some
to use it to divide the impressive unity of 1912. Syndicalism though
did not simply die away. Locally it remained important and one of the
largest fragments &#8211; the Industrial Democracy League led by Mann
with its Journal <strong>Solidarity</strong> had wider influence. But the
promise had clearly failed to materialise.</p>
<p>The normal explanation for this is somewhat trite. Syndicalism, it
is argued, ignored politics and paid the price for it. Syndicalists
did declare themselves to be &#8216;anti-political&#8217; and some did mean
it literally but for most &#8216;anti-political&#8217; meant
anti-parliamentary and anti-Labour party. This ambiguity was a
weakness but not as damning as it is often made out. The syndicalists
did have an impressive theoretical critique which recognised that
parliament was a façade
that hid the real bases of power and saw state control not as the
liberation of the working class but as the development of (their
term) state capitalism. Against this they held out for the value of
direct action by the working class through strikes not only
nationally or internationally. These elements were not all held to
the same extent by everyone, nor were they always expressed
unambiguously and coherently but they did mark a major step forward.
The problem was not so much then the lack of a theory as the lack of
an organisation to use it.</p>

<p>J.T. Murphy, a militant who first entered politics as a member of
a syndicalist inspired union amalgamation committee later described
the tasks of revolutionaries as to be &#8216;in the unions, of the
unions, but not determined by their limitations&#8217;. Syndicalism met
the first two criteria but as Murphy recognised, in going beyond it,
syndicalism broke itself on the last. <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a>
Simply working within the unions was not sufficient. This was
apparent in a number of ways. When major crises broke the
syndicalists lacked an organisation capable of supporting their
militants and enabling them to maximise the potential in strikes. In
the national coal strike in South Wales, for example, the militants
seem to have held themselves back. In the 1912 dock strike in London
Tom Mann recognised the need to argue and win other ports support for
the London dockers but others did not and in any case there was no
political organisation available to do this. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a>
Then during periods when militancy turned down the syndicalists were
deprived of a focus of action which could sustain both themselves and
their periphery. Equally when it came to the links with the community
the trade union focus too served to limit their impact. The
syndicalists great achievement was to recognise clearly where the
real power of capitalism lay and where the potential power of the
working class was but they could not themselves link the industrial
and the political. The fragmentation of syndicalism only perpetuated
these problems as it turned into sectarianism in 1913, and in 1914 it
intensified them.</p>

<p>Outside of these groups the only other group worthy of note was
the Socialist Labour Party (SLP). This had been formed in 1903 as a
breakaway from the SDF and it had come under the influence of
American industrial unionist Daniel De Leon. As is clear from Table
II it was a minuscule group though it had some industrial in strength
on the Clyde and its militants had played a key role in the Ruskin
College revolt of 1909 when the working class Students had revolted
against the teaching offered. What makes the SLP important is that
alone amongst the political groups it had a serious industrial
orientation and in one case &#8211; at the Singer factory on the Clyde in
1911 it briefly held perhaps 1500 out of 10,000 workers in its trade
union organisation.</p>

<p>For this it certainly deserves respect but Ray Challinor has gone
further and argued that in the SLP we can find &#8216;the origins of
British Bolshevism&#8217;. Certainly the SLP shared some theoretical
elements in common with Bolshevism before 1914 but it was not alone
in this and it is difficult to see why it should be singled out.
Equally it had many of the worst sectarian traits and its dual
unionism did no service to itself or to the militancy in general. The
super-discipline imposed by rigid control from the top, the knowledge
of marxism enforced by an exam system, the opposition to any
unofficial or branch leadership positions in unions and other related
features made it the very opposite of Bolshevism which was based upon
the development of a layer of self-reliant militants. <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The aftermath</h4>

<p>But the problem with looking around at groups and individuals to
find &#8216;origins&#8217; at this time is that it claims both too much and
too little. It claims too much in the sense that no-one had found the
model of a revolutionary political party that could steer between the
twin dangers of sectarianism and simple liquidation into the
parliamentary activities of the ILP and the Labour party. It claims
too little in the sense that it obscures what Bob Holton has called
&#8216;an indigenous dynamic&#8217; that was leading a whole series of
diverse rank elements towards the need for a political party along
the lines of that created by the Bolsheviks in Russia. That it needed
the impact of the first world war and the Russian Revolution to act
as a catalyst to cause these elements to fuse together should not
prevent us from recognising the importance of the militancy of
1910&#8211;1914 in creating them.</p>

<p>This needs to be insisted upon partly because some historians,
most notably Walter Kendall, argue that the Communist Party when it
was formed &#8216;was an almost wholly artificial creation which wrenched
the whole course of the (labour) movement&#8217;s left wing out of one
direction and set it off on another&#8217;. <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a>
But at a much wider level than this it also needs to be insisted upon
against those on the left who argue both that the British working
class is &#8216;non revolutionary&#8217; and that the existing political
forms have contained and can contain &#8211; perhaps with modification &#8211;
working class revolt. What the experience of 1910&#8211;1914 shows is
that at a time when the Labour Party and the trade unions were far
more flexible than they are today militants still found through
bitter experience that they were inadequate and that the fight for
socialism requires much more than these. The tragedy was that the
lesson had not been learnt before and so little was made of the
militancy. And, of course, to the extent that it is still denied each
generation is doomed to its cost to learn it too by even more bitter experience.</p>

<p>Did the militancy then find no political expression? Some
historians who have concentrated on parliamentary by-elections as an
index suggests not. But this ignores two factors. Firstly, the
militancy acted to increase the alienation of many from participation
in parliamentary politics and elections altogether. It has been
argued that this effect can be seen in some union elections but the
point has wider validity. This is not just a question of apathy. What
often happened was that &#8216;indifference&#8217; to the political system
changed under the impact of militancy to a conscious rationalisation
that participation produced nothing. How widespread this was is
difficult to say but further investigation may show it to have been
significant. <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a></p>

<p>The second factor is that parliamentary by-elections are subject
to too many variables in terms of constituency differences and are
too few in number to make any reliable judgements possible about
underlying changes in working class consciousness. There does however
exist an index which while not removing these problems does minimise
them somewhat. This is the evidence of local government elections.
What this shows was a clear swing to the left. This, while being an
indicator of changing consciousness, was far from a vote of
confidence in the existing parties or system. The evidence for this
lies in Table III.</p>

<p class="fst">Column 1 shows the organisational loss of momentum of the Labour
party and the ILP. The average number of candidates fell and is only
as high as it is during the period because of the large number
standing in 1913. Column 2 shows that there was indeed a significant
5% swing to the left and column 3 shows how this was rewarded in
terms of elected candidates. Typically the article from which this
data is taken makes no mention of the impact of the &#8216;labour unrest&#8217;
in explaining electoral performance. But the militancy cannot be
written out of history so easily. Our suggestions is that it caused a
swing to the left which was caught in these statistics and which took
place in spite of rather than because of the antics of the
parliamentary left. Certainly their leaderships drew no comfort from
these results. In this sense too it would be unwise to use the
problems of the Labour party as support for the proposition that
Liberalism was healthy. For a minority, perhaps a significant one,
the question mark hanging over the relevance of both to ordinary
people was bigger than ever in 1914.</p>

<p>Then in August 1914 it was all over. Weeks after a relatively
minor assassination Europe was at war. &#8216;The great General Strike of
1914&#8217; wrote George Dangerfield, had been &#8216;forestalled by some
bullets at Sarajevo&#8217;. <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a> But had
it? Even if we ignore this overblown scenario does not the collapse
of the militancy seen in <a href="#t1">Table I</a> and the mass voluntary enlistment of
workers show that it was all an illusion?</p>

<p>But things are not so simple. In the first place it is debatable
whether the working class had been moved on a significant scale by
imperialist war before and, in the second place, &#8216;enthusiasm&#8217; for
the war was general across Europe. <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a>
What we need to understand therefore are the specifics of each
situation and their relation to what went before.</p>

<p>If we pursue this a number of obvious points stand out. The war
was with a major European enemy and not one on the outposts of the
Empire and to this extent it was qualitatively different, the left
had certainly compromised itself by its jingoism and nationalism in
the past and the government had played on this using international
tension as an appeal to moderate conflict on the railways in 1907 and
again in 1912. Perhaps against this background what is remarkable is
the slowness with which working class support for the war was
generated. This might sound perverse in view of the huge voluntary
enlistment that emerged within weeks but to repeat a shopworn phrase
&#8216;a week is a long time in politics&#8217; and the way that support
snowballed is important.</p>

<p>One indication of this can be found in the only study of working
class recruitment between July and September 1914. This shows that in
spite of the gathering war clouds from July 25 there was no
discernible impact on recruitment before war broke out. When war was
declared the initial demands were for skilled men who were offered
much higher rates of pay than were available in civilian life and for
middle class groups like motorcyclists who were offered considerable
&#8216;bounties&#8217; if they enlisted with their machines. So far as
recruitment into the ranks is concerned the early pattern of
recruitment involved an intensification of the pre-war pattern &#8211;
largely unskilled workers though with a tendency for average age to
rise. And this recruitment took some days to snowball. <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a></p>

<p>It did so against a background of panic and disarray on the left.
Few socialists came out openly against the war, some abstained but a
majority quickly capitulated and openly supported the war effort.
This did have a real and legitimising influence for it gave the
propaganda claims about the war a credibility. It also gave
credibility to attempts to halt the militancy in its tracks. The
strikes did not simply stop by a vote of acclamation by workers fired
with a lust for war. What happened was that union executives used the
excuse of war and the confusion it caused to resolve their own crises
of leadership by imposing executive decisions on the strikers. <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a></p>

<p>It by no means follows from this that a stronger anti-war stand
would have pulled a majority of workers away from their initial
enthusiasm for war. This is plainly untrue. But it is legitimate to
suggest that a stronger anti-war base was possible. And small though
it was such a base did exist amongst workers and this is not to be
accounted for simply by the dominance of liberal pacifism. Nor was it
so negligible in comparative terms. <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a></p>

<p>This may not seem much to hold onto in the face of the catastrophe
of a world war. But the limited socialist opposition to war in August
1914 was to grow and feed into the next period of revolt when workers
protest in Britain was to go beyond the limits of 1910&#8211;1914 and for
a time be part of a general European revolutionary wave.</p>

strikes were 20% of all recorded strikes but only 6% in the years 1902&#8211;1910.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f11" name="n11">11.</a> A good indication of this is
that consistently over two thirds of strikes were settled by some
form of negotiation. In the 1890s around 13% were settled by
replacing workers and this fell to around 10% in the 1900s.
Throughout, strikes settled in this way were roughly a quarter of the
size of the &#8216;average strike&#8217; suggesting that this was a resort of
small rather than big employers.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f48" name="n48">48.</a> The Labour Party did not have
individual membership at this time. Membership came through its
affiliated organisations &#8211; trade unions, co-ops and ILP. James
Hinton analyses this double subordination in his <strong>Labour and

terms of the first generation of MPs are well analysed in D. Martin,

<p class="note"><a href="#f51" name="n51">51.</a> There is a large literature on
these constraints which is well summarised in W.L. Arnstein,
<em>Edwardian politics: turbulent spring or indian summer?</em>, in A.
O&#8217;Day (<em>ed.</em>), <strong>The Edwardian Age</strong>, 1979. Briefly &#8211; all
women were excluded from the vote, approximately 12% of males failed
to gain the vote under the various franchises in operation and a
further 30% who did get a vote lost it because they failed to meet
the registration requirement of living in the same house for 12
months. The wealthy, also had plural voting rights. Election costs
were huge &#8211; the ILP had to raise &#163;20,000 for the few candidates it
stood in 1894: so that money had to be got from trade unions or
wealthy &#8216;philanthropists&#8217; like Andrew Carnegie the American steel
industrialist or George Cadbury. Constituency boundaries were also
drawn so as to minimise the number of working class constituencies.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f52" name="n52">52.</a> This was first brought out by
Pelling, <strong>op. cit.</strong>, who argued that &#8216;there was nothing
&#8220;bourgeois&#8221; about this popular distrust of state intervention. On
the contrary, it can be readily associated with the view of the state
taken by Marxists, that it was an organisation run by and for the
benefit of the wealthy&#8217;, p.&nbsp;5. Reynolds, <strong>op. cit.</strong>,
gives a graphic description of this attitude with a keen
understanding of its rationale.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f53" name="n53">53.</a> D. Morris, <em>Democracy,
oligarchy and the ILP. 1906&#8211;1914</em> (mimeo), 1982.</p>

religion of socialism in Britain. 1883&#8211;1896</em>, <strong>History
Workshop</strong>, no.&nbsp;4. Autumn 1977, p.&nbsp;16. This important
article tries to push the &#8216;golden age&#8217; of socialism back to the
1880s and early 1890s when parties were embryonic. But while
indicating some of the ways in which the &#8216;fall&#8217; came Yeo fails to
explore how the ideological forms of socialism which he (with some
justice) celebrates also both allowed the &#8216;fall&#8217; to occur and
acted as a theoretical cover for it.</p>
