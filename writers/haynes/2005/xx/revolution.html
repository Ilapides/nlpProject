<strong>Revolution and Counterrevolution: Class Struggle in a Moscow Metal Factory</strong><br/>
<em>Berghahn Books, 2005, &#163;45</em></p>

<p class="fst">Alexander Rabinowitch<br/>
<strong>The Bolsheviks Come to Power: the Revolution of 1917 in Petrograd</strong><br/>
<em>Pluto Press, 2004, &#163;12.99</em></p>

<p class="fst">A book on the history of Russia which begins by asserting that
&#8216;the Marxists got it right. Leon Trotsky and Tony Cliff provided
the theoretical groundwork for much of my understanding of the
Russian Revolution while Victor Serge acted as the &#8220;conscience&#8221;
of the revolution by giving it such an inspirational and principled
voice&#8217; is bound to be of interest to readers of this journal. And
this is a book to beg, steal or borrow, for it is in a sense the
missing volume in the analysis of how state capitalism developed out
of the degeneration of the Russian Revolution.</p>

<p><strong>Revolution and Counterrevolution</strong> explores the lives of
workers in Moscow&#8217;s largest metalworking factory &#8211; the Guzhon
factory, which became the Hammer and Sickle works &#8211; in the years
between 1900 and 1932. It marks a double first in writing on the
Russian Revolution. It breaks the implicit taboo that has seemed to
prevent historians tracing the experience of these workers across
both the rise and fall of the revolution, and it is based on the most
intensive research in the Moscow archives.</p>

<p>Chapter one describes the emergence of an organised working class
in the Guzhon works, the heady days of 1905, the repression after the
defeat, and the pre-war radicalism that followed the massacre of
workers on the Lena Goldfields in 1912. This marked the start of an
upturn bringing large-scale industrial conflict back to Russian
factories on the eve of the First World War. Chapter two tells the
story of the 4,000 Guzhon workers involved in the revolution,
complementing the city-wide accounts of Petrograd and Moscow that
were written by Western historians in the 1980s. In 1917 factory
committees were created in the works, workers won the eight-hour day,
management was forced back and the level of class consciousness rose
to new heights.</p>

<p>&#8216;In the Marxist sense of a working class conscious of its
collective strength, 1917 marked the zenith of proletarian power in
the 20th century,&#8217; writes Murphy. It is at this point that his
analysis strikes out on its own to establish &#8216;how ... a movement
based on egalitarianism and freedom transformed into a system based
on exploitation and repression&#8217;.</p>

<p>The argument that the Russian Revolution degenerated from the high
point of 1917 under the blows of foreign intervention and civil war
will be familiar to readers. But what kind of country was Russia
between this point and Stalin&#8217;s consolidation of power? Although
Trotsky discredited the concept by stretching it to cover the era
after 1928, the idea of a degenerating workers&#8217; state captures an
important part of the reality. Lenin used a slightly different
formulation describing Russia as a workers&#8217; state with bureaucratic
deformations in a peasant country. Those of us who have written about
this have often been so fixated on the degeneration aspect that we
have neglected to analyse enough the extent to which, despite the
poverty and penury, there were positive gains and evidence of a still
vibrant, if more attenuated, culture below.</p>

<p>Here Murphy makes three important contributions. Firstly, he
rejects the legend of the Civil War &#8211; that Bolshevik labour policy
at this time anticipated Stalinism through &#8216;its iron discipline and
brutal terror&#8217;. The extreme collapse during the Civil War affected
the Hammer and Sickle works just as badly as other factories, but he
finds no evidence in the archives to support &#8216;grossly inflated
estimates about early state repression, concentration camps and
coercion&#8217;. The Civil War unravelled the working class and so
undercut class consciousness in favour of &#8216;a desperate and
apolitical individualism in the factory&#8217;. In 1921 the factory
nominally had 1,412 workers with conditions so bad that they were
producing only 4 percent of the pre-war output. Yet these remaining
workers &#8216;were almost completely unfazed by a state that had
virtually ceased to exist&#8217;. This was very different then from what
came later.</p>

<p>Secondly, whatever the deficiencies of Russia in the NEP period,
and they were many, Murphy argues that early on there was a positive
attempt to narrow the gap between the revolution and its base that
had resulted from the Civil War. In the early 1920s workers had real
material grievances in a situation of great difficulties, but they
articulated them within the context of a regime with which they had
an &#8216;uneasy compromise&#8217; and felt some identity. Certainly they
went on strike, they held boisterous mass meetings, but they also
joined the party for positive reasons and saw factory committees and
trade unions as vehicles for the expression of their grievances. This
led to the creation of a system of arbitration for disputes that came
to involve 6 million workers and which gave real weight to workers&#8217;
interests:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;The early Soviet participatory institutions differed
markedly from those of both the Tsarist and Stalinist eras. It was
workers&#8217; trust and involvement in workplace institutions that gave
the factory regime an essential degree of legitimacy.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Thirdly, Murphy shows how this was undercut in the second half of
the 1920s and how Stalin was able to rise to power on this increasing
separation of the state from the workers. This partly reflected the
pressures forcing the state towards industrialisation, but it also
reflected the changing position of workers, traced by Murphy in the
case of the Hammer and Sickle works.</p>

<p>Although the power of the workers to resist the bureaucratic
degeneration towards counterrevolution was weakening, Murphy supports
the argument of Michael Reiman in his <strong>The Birth of Stalinism</strong>
that there was something of a crisis in the factories in late 1927.
It appeared briefly that there might be a surge in support for the
opposition to the leadership. But this was overcome and after 1928
any independent working class expression was increasingly suppressed.
In the Hammer and Sickle works a minority of workers were co-opted
but most were forcibly squeezed by the state to help provide the
resources for industrialisation. &#8216;Management coercion rested on
social pressures by a milieu of hardened state loyalists to bully
other workers and utilised control over food as its most effective
weapon to discipline the workforce.&#8217; So far from Stalinism having
popular mandate, it was based on repression beneath which there was
&#8216;simmering but fractured discontent&#8217; among the workers of the
Hammer and Sickle factory.</p>

<p>Murphy&#8217;s book will not be popular in academic circles. Each of
the arguments he presents involves a challenge to the orthodoxy which
stresses the continuity between 1917 and Stalinism. It will be less
popular still because it is based on such serious research: &#8216;Fifteen
years after the doors of the archives swung open, not a single
source-driven study has supported either of the contending arguments
&#8211; that the workers were either terrorised by the early Soviet state
or impressed with Stalinism.&#8217;</p>

<p>But if his book is disliked because it stands out against the
mixture of eclecticism and confusion that passes for wisdom in the
study of Russian history these days then so much the better. The
pettiness of the academic world sometimes seems to know no bounds and
the pressures to conform are great. We should be grateful that Kevin
Murphy has had the courage to write a book which ends so confidently
with the argument that &#8216;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels were correct
... The history of the Russian Revolution is the history of class struggle.&#8217;</p>

<h1>Leadership battles</h1>

<p class="fst">During the 1970s and 1980s a &#8216;social history school&#8217; of
writers challenged both official Soviet histories of the Russian
Revolution which regarded the Bolsheviks as the architects of the
revolution, and the US Cold War historians who were hostile to the
revolution and the Bolsheviks. The social historians&#8217; work
concentrated on showing that 1917 was not a coup, nor the action of a
blind mob, but was based on a genuine mass movement led by workers
who were increasingly politically conscious of their own actions.</p>

<p>First published in 1976, <strong>The Bolsheviks Come to Power</strong> is
one of the best of these histories. Now republished, it offers a new
readership an involving and convincing account of the revolution
which has at its heart the self-activity of workers and soldiers, led
by a responsive and flexible Bolshevik Party that bears no
resemblance to the rigid, disciplined faction of right wing myth.</p>

<p>Rabinowitch&#8217;s history traces the &#8216;development of the
revolution from below&#8217;. He uses minutes of meetings of local and
city-wide soviets, the Provisional Government and the Bolsheviks,
resolutions and newspapers, to carefully assemble a compelling
account of the complex and fluid relationship between the Bolsheviks
and Petrograd&#8217;s workers and soldiers throughout the course of 1917.
In the process he decisively demolishes the idea of the revolution as
a highly organised coup forcibly imposed on the population.</p>

<p>Rabinowitch begins with the July Days in Petrograd, with the
Bolshevik retreat from a premature challenge for power and the
ensuing repression against the left. He examines the attempted right
wing coup in August, the steady draining away of support for the
Provisional Government that followed, and the rise of Bolshevik
support in the Petrograd Soviet which preceded the October revolution.</p>

<p>Rabinowitch emphasises the impact of the First World War on
driving the revolution forward in February, and in continuing to push
soldiers to the left as the government&#8217;s continuation of the war
alienated the army. He reveals the extent of this radicalisation &#8211;
despite the July accusation that Lenin was a German agent most
soldiers sided with the Bolsheviks because they were opposed to the
death penalty at the front which Kerensky, the head of the
Provisional Government, had reinstituted. By the time of the October
insurrection, Kerensky was unable to mobilise any troops from the
rear or the front in defence of his government against the forces of
the Bolshevik-led soviet.</p>

<p>The increasing polarisation between the right wing forces of the
Provisional Government and the revolutionary forces of the soviets
from February to October is rigorously drawn out. The government
installed by the February revolution had given in to right wing
forces that threatened the revolution, and increasingly the strong
impulse to unity that held the masses of workers and soldiers to the
government became focused instead on the creation of a revolutionary soviet.</p>

<p>Rabinowitch traces how these tensions within dual power in
Petrograd were played out, and demonstrates the necessity of the
October insurrection to prevent another counter-revolutionary attempt.</p>

<p>Many social history accounts, in stressing the independent action
of workers and soldiers, dilute the important role that the Bolshevik
Party and the individuals in it played. Rabinowitch shows that, while
October was clearly no coup or conspiracy, the Bolshevik role was
central, and was intimately related to the independent action of the
masses. The relationship between the party and the workers and
soldiers in the soviets, trade unions and, indeed, the other
socialist parties, was a dynamic and sensitive one. The Bolsheviks
were not imposing their desires onto the &#8216;masses&#8217;, but were part
of the collective shaping of a concrete strategy for the realisation
of collective desires. The February demand for &#8216;bread, peace and
land&#8217; became more radical as workers and soldiers found their hopes
for reform from the Provisional Government frustrated. They found
their desires expressed in the Bolshevik slogan of &#8216;All Power to
the Soviets&#8217;.</p>

<p>Rabinowitch attributes the Bolsheviks&#8217; success to the intense
debate within the party and to the strength of democratic centralism
&#8211; the leadership was often corrected by the membership in the
workplaces and local soviets, and indeed was often itself divided. In
explaining the Bolsheviks&#8217; growth and influence, Rabinowitch
emphasises &#8216;the party&#8217;s internally relatively democratic,
tolerant, and decentralised structure and method of operation, as
well as its essentially open and mass character&#8217;.</p>

<p>He also points to the growth of the party as contributing to its
flexible and accessible nature &#8211; the thousands of new members who
joined the party in 1917 were &#8216;by no means without influence, so
that to a significant degree the party was now responsive and open to
the masses&#8217;.</p>

<p>There are weaknesses with <strong>The Bolsheviks Come to Power</strong>:
Rabinowitch&#8217;s narrow focus means he spends little time on wider
events and processes, which makes some prior knowledge of the
revolution and its context essential. He constrains his account to
events and social changes in Petrograd with no reference to the rest
of Russia or the international context, which can be frustrating. His
approach &#8216;from below&#8217; provides much less sense of the view of
bourgeois forces at the time. However, within these limitations, the
cumulative power of the evidence Rabinowitch uses is thorough and
convincing without being dry &#8211; the atmosphere in Petrograd is
vividly transmitted and the sense of dynamism and development in
people&#8217;s actions and ideas comes through very well. There is even a
map with all the key buildings marked enabling the reader to follow
the revolution through the streets.</p>

<p>At a time when histories of the revolution are dominated by a new
&#8216;revisionism&#8217; &#8211; like Orlando Figes&#8217; <strong>A People&#8217;s Tragedy</strong>
and Anne Applebaum&#8217;s <strong>Gulag</strong>, both of which cloak their return
to traditional, hostile accounts of the revolution in more liberal
and populist language &#8211; this book is a reminder of the strengths of
social history writing at its best.</p>

<p>The collapse of Stalinism disoriented many on the left, in some
cases leading to dramatic political reversals. Consequently today
there is little resistance to the revisionist picture of the
revolution. This, and the renewed importance of debates over the
nature of leadership within the movement against capitalism and war,
in which interpretations of the Russian Revolution are crucial, make
the re-publication of this classic book timely and very welcome.</p>
