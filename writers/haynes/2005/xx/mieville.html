<p class="fst">China Mieville<br/>
<strong>Between Equal Rights: A Marxist Theory of International Law</strong><br/>
<em>Brill, Historical Materialism book series, 2005, Euro 69</em></p>

<p class="fst">Did Tony Blair break international law in his support for the
American invasion of Iraq? Could he be successfully prosecuted in an
international court? As evidence accumulates of the murky dealings
that led to war more and more people are coming to the conclusion
that there is a legal case to answer. China Mieville would disagree,
not because Blair&#8217;s actions weren&#8217;t &#8216;criminal&#8217;, but because
international law does not work in this way. Moreover it is an
illusion, he argues, to think that it could ever be made to function
in a fundamentally different way.</p>

<p>Mieville will be well known to readers of this journal as a
leading writer of science fiction in the UK. Here he pioneers
something quite different &#8211; the Marxist critique of international
law. The result is a significant book which, if parts are not for the
fainthearted, nevertheless establishes some very important ideas that
will influence not only the debate about Iraq and other Western
interventions but the whole approach to international law.</p>

<p>An obvious question to those who want to see Blair in court is,
who would arrest him and try him? But even if this could be answered
it by no means follows that there is a strong legal case against him.
This is not simply because of the ambiguities of the evidence but
also the ambiguities of the law itself. This does not mean that Blair
was right. It means that trying to condemn him in terms of
international law is not the right way to attack him. Mieville points
out for example that if there is ambiguity in the law about Iraq
there might well be other wars which were less ambiguous in law but
no less objectionable politically. But if the argument is left simply
at the level of law then we might be forced to support them. The same
applies to Iraq. No one has put the legal doubts about Iraq more
eloquently than Robin Cook, but suppose for a moment (a fantasy!)
that these were tested in some international court and there was
found to be no case to answer. Would Cook then hold his hands up and
say, &#8216;I was wrong and you were right Tony, it was legal, I should
have supported you ... &#8217;? As Mieville puts it, &#8216;A lawful war is
not necessarily a just, prudent or humanitarian war.&#8217;</p>

<p>A supporter of international law would argue that Blair and Bush
would have to be found guilty because the evidence and law to
interpret it is so clearly against them. But Mieville suggests that
this is not the case at all. Any state could find a basis in law for
almost any action, because &#8216;for every claim there is a
counter-claim, and legalist opposition to war is therefore ultimately toothless&#8217;.</p>

<p>Why should this be so? Three main positions commonly influence the
discussion of this problem. Realists see the basis of global
relations in the clash of state power. They are sceptical of ideas
like globalisation and sceptical of the idea of international
society. For them international law is no more than &#8216;a moralistic
gloss on power politics&#8217;. It plays a useful role in obscuring the
extent to which power is still the central determinant of how the
world works. If a conflict emerges between the &#8216;gloss&#8217; and state
needs then realpolitik dictates the impotence of international law
before power.</p>

<p>Against this supporters of international law argue that it exists
above states and can therefore constrain their actions. It must
represent some natural conception of what is right or it must develop
into a rational set of rules that states can be persuaded to agree
to. In either form it can be a force of stability and progress. If
this is not yet fully the case then this is because the law needs to
be further strengthened and then enforced.</p>

<p>The third and most critical view is associated with the left. This
is less idealistic. It largely accepts the role of power and it looks
at the way in which all law is conditioned by social interests and
not least capitalist interests. But it still aspires to use law for
progressive ends. Law, writes Susan Marks, is &#8216;a strategic tool,
which can be used for both good ends and bad ones, to constrain
violence and to legitimise it&#8217;. The task for the left is to
struggle to use and expand this space.</p>

<p>Mieville recognises the importance of this critical approach to
the understanding of law but he argues that it does not go far
enough. It especially fails for international law. This is not
because international law is not real law (as a realist might
suggest) and can therefore be dismissed. International law is
essential to the way global capitalism works. When, for example,
Robin Cook writes that &#8216;for the neo-conservatives around George
Bush it was a guiding principle that the US should undertake no
policy that conferred validity on the concept of international law&#8217;
(<strong>Guardian</strong>, 25 March 2005) he is simply wrong. The US wants and
needs international law &#8211; consider the issue of patent protection
or intellectual property rights, and so on. Yet it also needs its own
freedom of manoeuvre. Because the US is the world&#8217;s most powerful
state it has a greater capacity to manage and twist things to its own
advantage, but all states reflect this ambiguity and thus so does
international law. Mieville notes, for example, that all states have
a right to exist and war is only justified in terms of self-defence,
but he also notes that there is an equally long history in
international law where (and this must give Blair comfort) &#8216;great
powers have always asserted a right of intervention in the affairs of
small countries&#8217;.</p>

<p>To understand why this is we have to appreciate how international
law emerges at the intersection of two processes. One was the
development of the nation-state system, the other was the rise of
capitalism. Mieville argues that these are not separate or autonomous
processes but developments that fed off and supported one another. He
thus has much to say of historical interest on the way in which law
developed in the context of the shift from feudalism to capitalism
and the nature of that shift. But his central theoretical point is
that capitalism is a system of both commodity competition and
inter-state competition and this must be reflected in both the
existence and the ambiguity of the international order and its legal expressions.</p>

<p>One thread here is the contribution of the great Soviet legal
theorist Evgeny Pashukanis before he became a victim of Stalin.
Mieville builds on his analysis to show the role of commodity
production in the development of law. The rise of law, Mieville
suggests, has to be understood in the context of &#8216;market relations
generalising globally, in the transition to capitalism&#8217;.</p>

<p>Because capitalism is a global system of commodity production
organised through competing states, international law can only
partially contain states. Inter-state competition is also the
instrument through which international law develops. Demonstrating
this involves Mieville in a valuable historical analysis of the way
international law evolved in the context of colonialism, imperialism,
unequal treaties and the like. International law was not only a means
by which global capitalism incorporated non-capitalist parts of the
world; it was also an expression of the dominance of the powerful
imperialist nations. Thus those supporters of international law who
try to counterpose it to imperialism misunderstand its historical
roots &#8211; imperialism made international law, and international law
helped make imperialism and it continues to do so today. &#8216;Coercive
political violence &#8211; imperialism &#8211; is the very means by which
international law is made actual.&#8217;</p>

<p>International law cannot therefore transcend the system which
gives rise to it. The legalistic argument is not only wrong because
it cannot work. It is also wrong because those who support it fail to
reflect on why international law is so ambiguous and limited. As
capitalism changes so will international law, but it cannot be the
means to overcome the major contradictions of the system from within.
In this sense, says Mieville, international law is &#8216;fundamentally
unreformable ... I see no prospect of a systematic progressive
political project or an emancipatory dynamic coming out of
international law.&#8217; This is an important conclusion based on a deep
and impressive analysis of the law, its origin and history and
current state and it makes a major contribution to the way we think
about the world. It is well worth ordering through your library.</p>
