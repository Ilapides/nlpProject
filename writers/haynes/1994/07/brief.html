<p class="c">Sexual liberation is central to the idea of socialist
revolution. <em>Mike Haynes</em> looks at how the Russian Revolution in
1917 challenged the morality of the old regime, but how the growth of
Stalinism smashed the gains of 1917 and left a legacy of repressed
and distorted sexuality that endures even today</p>

<p class="fst">Attitudes to sex can tell us much about a society. In the case of
Russia the changing attitude to sex throws considerable light on the
nature of the different regimes that have controlled that society in
the 20th century.</p>

<p>Today Russia is a society drowning in sexual imagery. Pornography
is rife. On the bookstalls, in the markets and subways, it is
possible to find everything from Trotsky&#8217;s <strong>History of the
Russian Revolution</strong> to <strong>Mein Kampf</strong> and <strong>Lord of the Rings</strong>
sitting alongside &#8216;erotica&#8217;. Even if you don&#8217;t have enough
money to buy them, if you offer enough, the stallholder might let you
look for a few seconds at the &#8216;Playmate of the Month&#8217;.</p>

<p>Yesterday none of this existed. But Russia was just as hung up on
sex in the negative sense. Under Stalin it became, in the words of
one sociologist, a society with a &#8216;pathological animosity to sex&#8217;.
And yet in the period after 1917 socialists had seen Russia as the
most free society on earth, eliminating not only exploitation and
oppression but also sexual repression.</p>

<p>Conservatives have always accused revolutionaries of &#8216;immorality
and free love&#8217;. And it is true that socialists do repudiate the
hypocrisy of conventional society. But the socialist argument
involves more than this. Marx and Engels argued that human
relationships are distorted by class society. The relationships of
men and women are moulded not least by the oppression of women.</p>

<p>By removing the material base of class, Marx and Engels argued,
socialism can create the possibility of new human relationships
developing. In particular by liberating women a real equality will be
possible in which men and women face each other as real equals with
the right to choose and say yes and no. A free choice of heterosexual
or homosexual love would develop without the interference of society.</p>

<p>Russia at the start of the 20th century was like any other
capitalist state. The subjection of women was reinforced by the law.
The wife was required &#8216;to follow her husband as head of the family,
to love and respect him, to submit to him in every respect&#8217;.
Although a small but growing feminist and socialist movement
challenged these ideas, most people lived lives set by the
conventional world of male domination. The aristocracy and middle
classes proclaimed the virtue of stable marriage but this was belied
by the tens of thousands of prostitutes and the VD wards where
servant women made up the biggest group. Among the peasants it was
still common for a whip to be passed to the man in the marriage
ceremony and sometimes this was hung above the couple&#8217;s bed. In the
lower classes generally wife beating was endemic, and everywhere
material poverty sapped the pleasure of human relationships.</p>

<p>Yet pressures for change developed both from the socialist
movement and from the beginnings of a new self confidence from women
as they moved into the workplace and found a collective strength.
Revolution in 1917 boosted this. One soldier interrupted a women&#8217;s
street meeting to ask, &#8216;Does this mean I can&#8217;t hit my wife?&#8217;
The crowd shouted, &#8216;None of that. You just try it. Nothing doing.
Let ourselves be beaten any more? Not on your life. Nobody has the
right now.&#8217; In the factories too, women took revenge on the boss
and foremen who had humiliated them. Of course, revolution was no
magic wand that transformed everything but here was a process
beginning from below where women especially asserted the right to
their free development.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviks tried to reinforce this in the first days of
revolutionary power by their decrees on women. The rights to free
marriage and free divorce were established, distinctions in law
between legitimacy and illegitimacy removed. Homosexuality was
decriminalised. To help pregnant women a special department of the
Commissariat of Health was established and in 1919 women in the
Bolshevik Party created the <em>Zhenotdel</em> &#8211; a special women&#8217;s department.</p>

<p>The new spirit was expressed by one <em>Zhenotdel</em> worker in 1920:
&#8216;Communism emancipates women, communism emancipates children,
communism transforms the relations between the sexes into simply
private relations, communism transforms the woman from &#8220;the wife of
a person&#8221; into a person.&#8217; In this sense a woman, said another
member of the <em>Zhenotdel</em>, would &#8216;not be inferior to a man in
anything&#8217;. The Bolshevik leader Alexandra Kollontai identified what
this meant for personal relationships, &#8216;a union of affection and
comradeship, a union of two equal members of the communist society,
both of them free, both of them independent, both of them workers.&#8217;</p>

<p>But these fine aspirations were undercut by the horrors of the
Civil War which stretched the revolution almost to breaking point. As
the cities starved and froze and resources were drained away to the
military front it was impossible to turn the aspirations into
reality. Human relationships were formed in the worst of times. At
best they were brief encounters. &#8216;Love meant: I&#8217;m going to die,
to die&#8217;, wrote Ilya Ehrenburg in a poem of the time. &#8216;Love meant:
Go, leaping, fire, along the wind. Love meant: Where are you? Where?&#8217;
Some confused this rough enforced equality with a new morality but,
as one socialist critic has put it, they were &#8216;simply glamourising
the helpless situation of people fighting a war&#8217;. It was in this
fearful context that an immense step forward was made in 1920 to
decriminalise abortion as a way of relieving the pressures on women &#8211; 
the first time that this had happened anywhere in the advanced world.</p>

<p>But at worst in these years something else occurred. As the social
facilities crumbled, children were abandoned and orphaned on a
massive scale &#8211; half a million by 1922. In the undergrowth
prostitution flourished and black market publishers still found paper
to print pornography. The end of the Civil War in 1921 brought new
opportunities but also new dangers. Bolshevik rule had just survived
but much of the working class had been destroyed and with it the
spirit of 1917.</p>

<p>The 1920s were therefore full of ambiguities. At one level it was
a time of experiment and ferment, in sex as much as anything else.
&#8216;What fun we had mocking the cult of virginity&#8217;, one woman
remembered. A small gay culture developed. Nudists marched on the
streets of Petrograd to celebrate the human body. Alexandra Kollontai
wrote stories of the dilemmas of those freed from convention. But
just beneath the surface was a different picture.</p>

<p>Even among the free spirits of the party freedom became twisted.
&#8216;Any Komsomol woman or female student has to do the bidding of any
man to whom she seems pleasing, otherwise she is &#8220;petty bourgeois&#8221;
and does not deserve the name of proletarian student&#8217;, complained
the head of the <em>Zhenotdel</em>.</p>

<p>Resisting the degeneration in this area of life, as elsewhere, was
not easy. Some thought personal life unimportant. Others saw their
chance to use their power. Bukharin attacked the case of a party
official who was procuring girls in the resort of Sochi for other
officials as a symbol of the revolution&#8217;s degeneration. Still
others &#8211; notoriously Stalin &#8211; moved towards an acceptance of
family values as the basis of the retreat from the high ideals of 1917.</p>

<p>As early as 1923 he can be found arguing that, &#8216;The female
workers and peasants are mothers, the educators of our youth &#8211; the
future of our country.&#8217;</p>

<p>So long as the uneasy balance of the New Economic Policy (NEP)
remained, so did some of the earlier gains. One peasant woman said in
1927, &#8216;Yes, I think it is a little better. Men are ashamed to beat
their wives so often ... I think they are also afraid. A woman in the
next village got a divorce.&#8217; But what remained of the earlier
liberation was swept away by the victory of Stalin and the final
overturn of the remains of the revolution.</p>

<p>The objective was rapid industrialisation and competition with the
West. This needed women in the labour force on a massive scale but it
also needed the family as the basic cell of society. Stalin pushed
the Soviet Union towards one of the most sexually repressed societies
in the advanced world in the 20th century.</p>

<p>Homosexuality was made a crime again in 1933 and abortion
effectively banned from 1936. The family and &#8216;mother heroine&#8217;
were celebrated. Women had to be both workers and mothers. &#8216;I am
ready to give birth every year&#8217;, wrote one woman joyously in
response to the banning of abortion to stimulate population growth.</p>

<p>Discussions of sex simply disappeared. Naked bodies were not
allowed in paintings. Sex could not be reflected in books and films.
The first screen kiss was not seen until 1956. Unmarried couples
could not stay in hotels. In the streets police whistles stopped
courting couples and in private the Communist Party played the role
of moral policeman.</p>

<p>People did struggle to find love and comfort in one another. &#8216;They
think just because we have had Stalin we have never lived and loved
like people&#8217;, said one woman. But it was difficult to keep the
world out of your bed &#8211; not least if you lived in a communal room
and feared that fleeting passion would bring another pregnancy.</p>

<p>After the death of Stalin there was a gradual relaxation in the
discussion of sexuality. Women&#8217;s lives did improve &#8211; especially
after 1955 when abortion was again allowed. But contraception
remained uncertain. By the 1980s only 20 percent of need was being
covered and Soviet women had as many as 10 million abortions a year.</p>

<p>Sex education continued to be taboo until it was gingerly broached
in the 1980s. Overall attitudes remained trapped as the sexual
revolution passed by the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Ignorance and repression combined to produce bigotry. Sex was
smut. Real men did it their way. Real men and women were not
&#8216;queers&#8217;. In the early 1970s the film director Sergei Paradzhanov
was sentenced to five years hard labour for homosexuality and many
lesser known men suffered with less publicity.</p>

<p>People were told that this repressive society was one that had
achieved socialism and women&#8217;s freedom. But if this was so then it
is not surprising that people turned away from the ideas of both
socialism and women&#8217;s emancipation in disgust. From the 1960s,
generations developed which began to see unrestrained sex as a
gesture of apolitical opposition to the regime. It was opposition
because &#8216;they don&#8217;t want us to do it&#8217;. It was apolitical
because it took place in an ideological vacuum and it pointed to a
liberation no less false than the one that had been claimed to exist before.</p>

<p>When the system began to collapse at the end of the 1980s it
opened up an explosion of repressed interest in sex and sexuality,
and women in particular were cynically encouraged to celebrate their
ability to serve man&#8217;s sexual needs as a form of liberation in the
same way that they had earlier been encouraged to see the double
burden of worker and homemaker as freedom.</p>

<p>In one sense this is not unusual. Russia today echoes the
contradictions in Portugal and Spain in the 1970s when politically
and sexually repressive dictatorships fell. Sexual images,
pornography and politics jostle one another. But there is a vital
difference. In these cases movements developed in which men and women
could argue for a real emancipation.</p>

<p>In Russia the vacuum is continuing. It is reinforced by talk of
putting women back into the home as beautiful wives. Small gay and
women&#8217;s movements have developed but it is difficult for them to
stand against the flood. The fascist Zhirinovsky has seen political
potential in building on this pseudo liberation. He shocked many by
deliberately suffusing his election speeches with sexual imagery.
Some responded with disdain. It was a bad misjudgement. Zhirinovsky
in this as so much else represents an outcome which derives from the
legacy of exploitation and oppression which masqueraded as socialist
freedom and so denied people the chance to explore a real path to
freedom in both their politics and personal life.</p>
