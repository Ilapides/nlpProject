<p class="fst">Russia is an important placing for Western journalists and they
usually produce a saleable book when they finish their stint. The
work of these correspondents has played an important role in
establishing the Western view of Russia. Before glasnost, because
they had no access to the top, they could only report policy changes
and official press briefings. But by weaving together pointed
anecdotes, information gleaned from the press and the occasional
nugget handed out at the top they were able to build up valuable
pictures of Russian society below.</p>

<p>After 1985 more access to the top was available but, as in the
writings of Martin Walker, it was the explosion of information from
below that took centre stage.</p>

<p>Now all is different. Jonathan Steele went out to Russia to report
the collapse of the USSR for the <strong>Guardian</strong>. He has had
unrivalled access to the top, including getting to Gorbachev straight
after the defeat of the 1991 coup. His book reflects this, drawing on
indiscreet interviews with past and current players in the battles at
the top of the USSR. The result is a book that anyone interested in
Russia will have to read and can learn a lot from.</p>

<p>But there is also a sense in which Steele&#8217;s book is a less
satisfactory one than those of his predecessors. They had no choice
but to write from the bottom up. Steele has chosen to write from the
top down.</p>

<p>But while the top is fascinating, what we really need is an
analysis of the disintegration of the middle and bottom of Russian
society. This is not only because the top does not operate in a
vacuum but also because it is here that the future of Russia will be
decided. Steele senses this but cannot deliver the analysis. Instead,
as the title <strong>Eternal Russia</strong> suggests, he resorts to the old
argument that Russia&#8217;s future is written in its past &#8211; centuries
of authoritarianism mean there is no civil society, no democratic tradition.</p>

<p>It is not an argument Steele feels comfortable with, but it is all
he offers. It contains an element of truth. Democratic traditions are
important, but they do not hang in the air. What is needed to
understand Russia in 1994 is an analysis of 1994 and not of 1894 or 1794.</p>

<p>Steele, like many, thought that Russia was different from the West
and he is still to an extent paralysed in his thinking by a
recognition that it was not.</p>

<p>This comes out clearly in his discussion of October 1993. Steele
provides a valuable discussion of Yeltsin&#8217;s manipulation of the
crisis but he is caught in a trap of his own making. He seems to
sympathise with the old parliament who in a legalistic sense
certainly had right on their side. But he cannot abandon Yeltsin as
democracy&#8217;s hope. Because he looks from the top down it is the
fissures in the ruling class that dominate the whole issue for him
and suddenly Zhirinovsky rises like a rabbit out of a hat in the
final pages.</p>

<p>If Steele cannot deliver, academia have no less difficulties. <strong>The
Fourth Way</strong> illustrates this. As Eastern Europe collapsed there
was much abstract talk about a third way between Stalinism and the
unregulated market, but this was rhetorically swept aside by many new
leaders with the demand for &#8216;markets without adjectives&#8217;. Steele
points out that this was based on a fantasy view of &#8216;really
existing capitalism&#8217; but for a crucial period not only was the
revolutionary left squeezed out of the discussion but so was social democracy.</p>

<p><strong>The Fourth Way</strong> &#8211; the phrase is clutched out of the air to
get an Eastern Europe audience &#8211; is an attempt to put a weak social
democracy back into the discussion. The essays question the nature of
privatisation west and east and provide some (occasionally) useful
information, though more about Eastern Europe than Russia.</p>

<p>What is ironic is that a part of the left that generally believed
this area to be different should now be trying to teach Eastern
European reformers how to be real capitalists rather than fantasy ones.</p>

<p>When those at the bottom need a real alternative to the worst
ravages of crisis, the disillusioned Western liberal and social
democrat stands on the sidelines shouting &#8211; capitalism shouldn&#8217;t
be quite like this.</p>
