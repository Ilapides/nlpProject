  <h1>Open letter to the U.S. Congress on Clinton-Yeltsin summit</h1>

  <h2>What a Russian deputy might say</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 15, 1993)</h5>

  <p>What if a communist member of the Russian Congress of People's Deputies were to
  address the U.S. Congress? What if she or he had the chance to challenge the version of
  things now being put forth by the U.S. government and media?</p>

  <p>Here's what such a Russian deputy could say in an open letter to the U.S.
  Congress.</p>

  <p>Dear members of the U.S. Congress:</p>

  <p>As you well know, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin imbued their joint April 4 news
  conference at the close of the Vancouver, Canada, summit with a spirit of camaraderie
  and good fellowship. Indeed, that was the sense of the whole weekend.</p>

  <p>But good will is hardly an accurate description of the United States government's
  attitude toward Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union. Nothing better reveals
  the reality than the Grayling submarine incident.</p>

  <p>On March 20, the U.S.S. Grayling &mdash; an attack submarine equipped with 16
  ocean-spanning nuclear missiles &mdash; collided with a Russian submarine. According to
  the Pentagon, the Grayling was engaged in "routine" intelligence surveillance.</p>

  <p>That is hardly the case. Both submerged vessels were seriously damaged when they
  collided in the Arctic Ocean 105 nautical miles north of Murmansk &mdash; off the
  Russian coast in Russian territorial waters.</p>

  <p>Imagine how you would have reacted if a Russian nuclear submarine had collided with
  a U.S. vessel off the Florida coast. It would have been an international incident of
  monumental proportions.</p>

  <p>President Clinton was obliged to apologize at the April 4 news conference. He said,
  "I don't mind saying to this whole assembly that I told President Yeltsin I very much
  regretted the submarine incident." But we had to look with a fine-toothed comb to find
  the apology in your supposedly democratic press.</p>

  <p>In its March 23 report the New York Times had called the incident "the latest round
  of a cat-and-mouse game that has outlived the Cold War." It was actually much more than
  that. It was a most dangerous development that pushed humanity toward the edge of
  nuclear war.</p>

  <p>We had thought those dark days were over. Now we find that was a cruel illusion.</p>

  <h4>A dangerous game</h4>

  <p>These incidents used to occur quite frequently. The U.S. Navy regularly reported
  "sightings" of Soviet Navy vessels in supposedly threatening positions, and even
  concocted non-existent incidents &mdash; collisions and the like &mdash; when it suited
  its purpose. The incidents were never confirmed.</p>

  <p>As Harrison Salisbury pointed out a long time ago, Naval sightings of Russian subs
  always coincided with Congressional hearings on military appropriations, for the Navy
  in particular. Playing up the "Soviet threat," the Pentagon successfully pitched for
  more and more money.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Pentagon was able to mislead the public in this country by
  spinning fantasies about Soviet military aggression. It was a dangerous game, and it
  created a dangerous situation.</p>

  <p>Now the Pentagon is again ready to mislead the public and create another dangerous
  situation, pushing for military measures to accomplish U.S. imperialism's political and
  economic goals.</p>

  <p>The media in your country portray the armed forces of the former Soviet Union as
  completely disintegrated &mdash; a pushover. They make it appear that the once-mighty
  Red Army is all washed up, finished.</p>

  <p>In a recent editorial, the New York Times took malicious delight in sarcastically
  asking, "What Red Army?" The Times answered: "The Red Army, once one of the world's
  most formidable fighting forces, is in an advanced state of disintegration. Its finest
  divisions have splintered, its draft calls go largely unheeded, its equipment is
  inoperative. . . . "</p>

  <p>That's all true for the present. But the implication is that the way is now clear
  for the Pentagon to force its hand. That is not correct.</p>

  <p>This is a great illusion &mdash; and an extremely perilous one if it leads the
  Pentagon to become adventurous and reckless. The enemies of the Soviet Union have made
  that mistake before.</p>

  <p>The Red Army appeared to be disintegrating and breaking up during the great purges
  of 1937. Hitler thought the Soviet armed forces were finished because of the purges in
  the army and elsewhere. He thought the Soviet people would not fight. So he launched
  what he called Operation Barbarossa.</p>

  <p>But to the world bourgeoisie's amazement the Red Army regrouped and recovered,
  defeated the Nazis, and in the process became a great industrial, technological and
  military power.</p>

  <p>Now, it is certainly true that at this moment the forces of counter-revolution have
  the upper hand in the former USSR. So what is the purpose of all this military
  maneuvering by the Pentagon?</p>

  <p>The purpose is to pressure the Yeltsin cabal of counter-revolutionaries to surrender
  on all the U.S. government's demands, both external and domestic. Can it be a
  coincidence that the submarine-ramming incident took place the very same day that
  Yeltsin announced on Russian television that he would rule by decree?</p>

  <p>Or was it a signal from the military-industrial complex, reminding Yeltsin about
  who's really in control and whose bidding he must do?</p>

  <p>The U.S. is offering the carrot of economic aid and at the same time brandishing the
  stick of military intervention. Together, the two tactics are aimed at making the
  former Soviet Union capitulate economically &mdash; and finally, to completely hand the
  whole country over to private ownership, dominated by the U.S. bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>And your press is not reporting it.</p>

  <h4>Elected by the people</h4>

  <p>It's unfortunate that our Congress of People's Deputies didn't take advantage of the
  opportunity to roundly expose the purpose of the the April 3-4 summit.</p>

  <p>Had I and some of my colleagues had our way, we would have called upon the Russian
  people to come out in the hundreds of thousands for a giant demonstration that would
  really show where the people stand.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, my colleagues did not mount a campaign to counter the one issuing
  from Clinton and Yeltsin. Nor did they use diplomatic channels to answer the slanders
  against them and the Soviet people that constantly appear in the U.S. press.</p>

  <p>But it is time to expose the canard, repeated in your ruling class-controlled press
  time and time again, that the Congress of People's Deputies is an undemocratically
  elected body.</p>

  <p>If you're so convinced the Congress is undemocratic, why don't you ever mention that
  it is the same body that elected Yeltsin and all the members of his Cabinet? Congress
  first appointed Yeltsin president of Russia in 1990. The general election didn't occur
  until over a year later.</p>

  <p>The current members of the Congress were elected in March 1990 &mdash; not on the
  basis of a single slate or candidate, but in a multi-party election. When this idea was
  first broached it was applauded in the United States.</p>

  <p>Our Congress was elected by the people. Each deputy was directly elected. If you had
  any criticism of these elections, it was not evident in your press at the time the vote
  took place three years ago.</p>

  <p>Not even newspapers that have always closely followed events in the USSR, like the
  Washington Post and New York Times, criticized the elections. The elections established
  the present character of the Congress. Yet at the time you barely noticed it. How
  odd.</p>

  <p>You had claimed for years that the Soviet Union was an autocratic, undemocratic
  entity, that the Congress of People's Deputies was an unelected body. You demanded
  pluralistic, contested elections in our country. But once we deputies were elected on
  that basis, you refused to even comment on it.</p>

  <p>Apparently the election results were not satisfactory to your government. That's too
  bad. It must be why the press is now singing a different tune &mdash; excoriating the
  Congress of People's Deputies as an undemocratic body and praising a president who
  seeks to arrogate dictatorial powers to himself.</p>

  <p>It might be worth your time to delve into the recent past. You'll remember that the
  United States Congress and the Congress of People's Deputies have had regular
  diplomatic relations with each other for many years. Again, not a word of it in your
  press. Inter-parliamentary delegations have traveled from your country to ours and from
  our country to yours.</p>

  <p>This is clear evidence that the respective governments recognized the legitimacy of
  the two congresses. How can you forget all that, with not even a whisper in the
  press?</p>

  <h4>Remember the Alabama</h4>

  <p>Recognizing only one arm of a government and regarding the other as illegal and
  illegitimate constitutes rank interference in a country's internal affairs. It is
  unthinkable that you would ever allow such treatment from another country.</p>

  <p>You certainly didn't during your Civil War against slavery, when England rudely
  interfered in your internal affairs by supporting the South. Britain actively supported
  the Confederacy. It built ships to transport war materiel to the South, and warships
  that inflicted considerable damage on the Northern fleet.</p>

  <p>Many of you are lawyers. So you must remember the case of the Alabama. You have
  studied this famous case, known as "the Alabama claims," in your law schools.</p>

  <p>The Alabama was a Confederate cruiser built and outfitted by Britain. After the war,
  the U.S. government claimed damages for the harm the Alabama did.</p>

  <p>Under the 1871 Treaty of Washington, an international arbitration tribunal judged
  Britain guilty of interference in the internal affairs of another country. The panel
  held Britain liable for $15,500,000 in damages for losses the Alabama inflicted.</p>

  <p>So your own history offers a lesson on what happens when countries intervene in the
  affairs of others. Yet that is precisely what your government has done since Yeltsin
  made his move to seize power March 20.</p>

  <p>White House Communications Director George Stephanophoulos intervened first, with a
  swift public statement supporting Yeltsin and opposing the Congress of People's
  Deputies. Then President Clinton confirmed it, making U.S. policy official.</p>

  <p>To come out against the Russian Congress in such a flagrant way is a most shocking
  form of interference &mdash; in fact, intervention &mdash; in another country's
  internal affairs.</p>

  <p>This cannot be. It will not stand the test of history.</p>

  <p>We should also take note of the fact that not everyone in your capitalist
  establishment agrees about what is going on in Russia, or what the United States should
  do about it.</p>

  <p>For instance, then-CIA head Robert Gates had very enthusiastically announced the end
  of communism in December 1991. He was obliged some 15 months later to acknowledge, in a
  considerably subdued tone, that U.S. influence in Russia &mdash; meaning internal
  interference in the former Soviet Union &mdash; is only "marginal." That's a
  considerable come-down.</p>

  <p>It prompted former Secretary of State James Baker, who served in two
  administrations, to attack. He wrote in the April 5 issue of Newsweek that to "wait out
  the political storm in Moscow . . . [is] both dangerous and naive."</p>

  <p>This shows that in your ruling establishment there is a division of opinion rather
  than unanimity about the "aid" package &mdash; or, more precisely, about how and when
  to intervene in our affairs.</p>

  <h4>Teach us banking?</h4>

  <p>Our country, the Soviet Union, was up until just recently able to dispense billions
  of dollars in aid and assistance to other countries, in the developing world and the
  socialist bloc. Our economy grew every year.</p>

  <p>Your banks &mdash; U.S. banks &mdash; regarded the USSR as the most credit-worthy
  country in the world.</p>

  <p>So now we find it rather amusing to hear you say you're going to send people over
  here to teach us banking, accounting and all that. How did we manage up to now?</p>

  <p>How did we build a mighty industrial power &mdash; with full employment, housing,
  health care and education for all &mdash; if we didn't know anything about money
  management? How did we victoriously defeat the counter-revolution and win the civil
  war, including driving out your invading forces after the Bolsehviks seized state
  power? How did we triumph over the Nazis?</p>

  <p>How did we maintain a stable ruble and no inflation all those years? But now you
  suddenly come up with the idea that we have no bankers, no one with any understanding
  of finance.</p>

  <p>We know what you're doing. You're not really interested in teaching us banking and
  accounting methods.</p>

  <p>The real goal is to penetrate our government with an influx of State Department/CIA
  representatives. That's who these "bankers," "scholars" and so on really are. It's a
  bald move toward intervention, albeit under the thin cover of "helping the economy get
  in shape."</p>

  <p>Surely no one thinks we're fooled by any of this. We understand these operations. We
  know what they are. If you really were coming here to teach us, it would be incredible
  arrogance on your part. But that's not what's happening at all.</p>

  <p>You're coming in as a conqueror, not as a friendly collaborator.</p>

  <p>Look at your $1.6 billion in "aid," which Clinton graciously presented to Yeltsin in
  Vancouver. Frankly, we in Russia regard it with scorn. You are taking advantage of the
  fact that our country, unfortunately, is temporarily represented by a bankrupt
  politician who needs a bail-out.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin represents Western capitalist interests and the thin stratum of Russian
  capitalists you are so desperately trying to cultivate. But you're barking up the wrong
  tree with him. You can't grow giant oaks from crabgrass.</p>

  <p>The "aid" itself doesn't really amount to much. Its purpose is not to advance our
  country's interests. Rather, the lenders are advancing their own interests. That's the
  whole idea.</p>

  <p>One of your own newspapers &mdash; the New York Times &mdash; actually expressed
  this view in its April 4 coverage of the Vancouver summit, in an article subtitled "No
  Matter Who Counts, It Is Not As Advertised," by Celestine Bohlen.</p>

  <h4>Revolution overthrew Russian capitalism</h4>

  <p>President Clinton has said time and again that Russia has never had a democracy,
  never had any free markets or a free economy. When he says the market system never
  existed and no one contests that absurd statement, it shows that your country has a
  totally monolithic press.</p>

  <p>What a ridiculous thing to say, especially the point regarding free markets &mdash;
  by which he undoubtedly means a capitalist market. This has existed for several
  centuries, in Russia in particular.</p>

  <p>Your bourgeoisie isn't introducing anything new to Russia with private markets and
  so on. Lenin was among the first to write about the development of capitalism in
  Russia, in 1903. And there have been many other books on it.</p>

  <p>Private interests, private ownership of the means of production &mdash; in other
  words, the profit system &mdash; were the very reason a great proletarian revolution
  took place in 1917. The people rose up to overthrow that system and establish a
  socialist system instead.</p>

  <p>The Bolsheviks' central slogan before the overthrow of the old regime was "down with
  the 10 capitalist ministers." They were capitalists. Capitalism was bad for Russia. And
  for that reason it was overthrown.</p>

  <p>We even had a democracy here in Russia &mdash; of the type about which you U.S.
  politicians tend to get very enthused. Remember? The Kerensky democracy. It was a
  democracy; even Lenin called it the freest in the world. Free press, freedom of
  religion, all the freedoms that are generally accepted in the most advanced capitalist
  countries.</p>

  <p>But this democracy wouldn't stand by its promise to withdraw from the imperialist
  war &mdash; World War I &mdash; and stop the carnage. In contrast, the Bolsheviks were
  ready, willing and able &mdash; and did stop the war. They gave land to the peasants
  and bread to the masses.</p>

  <p>So why continue to say Russia is so ignorant, it never had a democracy, it never had
  free markets? These are all slanders. Why don't your press or you politicians get up to
  denounce them?</p>

  <p>It is shameless to not even mention that the Kerensky regime was a democracy &mdash;
  true, a bourgeois democracy, but it was a democracy. Like all capitalist democracies in
  case of imperialist war, it stood with the imperialists and thereby undid itself.</p>

  <h4>U.S. intervention must stop</h4>

  <p>Your Congress has the power of the purse. Yet it's the president who has now made
  $1.6 billion in commitments.</p>

  <p>To the best of our knowledge, no new "aid" package has been approved by the U.S.
  Congress. No Congressional oversight committee has been established. And there have
  been no Congressional hearings on how long this "aid" will continue.</p>

  <p>We regret that so few members of the U.S. Congress have participated in this
  process. This unanimity on your part, as elected government officials, is very
  disturbing. It is reminiscent of the fascism that you denounce in other countries.</p>

  <p>If the whole Congress is indeed in accord with Clinton's policy, why haven't you, as
  elected representatives, taken part in the decision-making? And have your constituents
  had a say? Do the people of your country want the U.S. to intervene in our country
  &mdash; and have they been informed of what that might bring?</p>

  <p>If all this interference and intervention in our internal affairs continues &mdash;
  and as so many commentators have said, it may bring about civil war &mdash; it will
  become the biggest super-quagmire you've ever been in.</p>

  <p>Let's not forget how you intervened in the war in China. Your government provided
  the principal financial, political and arms support for Chiang Kai-shek. That lasted
  for 27 years, and then you had to withdraw when the Chinese Revolution swept into
  power.</p>

  <p>How do you justify all the interventions in which your government engages? Right now
  in your own Western Hemisphere your government is actively intervening in two sovereign
  nations &mdash; in both cases against the cause of democracy.</p>

  <p>In Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide was duly elected president only to be deposed by a
  military regime nine months later. Your government is playing a key role in placing
  obstacles to his return to power. And in Cuba, the people face deepening hardships
  because you are maintaining a murderous blockade to punish them for building a
  socialist society.</p>

  <p>As for our country, you intervened here once before. We can still visit U.S.
  soldiers' graves from the 1919 intervention. They died here in the Soviet Union, in an
  illegal war into which you entered along with 14 other imperialist countries.</p>

  <p>If there's war again, this time it will drain your government's resources as nothing
  else has. Isn't it time to call a halt to the campaign of vilification against the
  Congress of People's Deputies?</p>
