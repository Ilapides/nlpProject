  <h1>Yeltsin's dilemma and the Russian working class</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Oct. 21, 1993)</h5>

  <p>Following in the footsteps of Mikhail Gorbachev, his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin has
  embarked on a foreign affairs adventure, visiting Japan in order to negotiate credits
  and loans for Russia.</p>

  <p>It would be an act of supreme international working-class solidarity if the trade
  unions of Japan were to demonstrate against him in a show of solidarity and sympathy
  with the working-class movement in Russia.</p>

  <p>Such an act of solidarity at a time like this would help the Russian working class
  in its struggle to overcome the fascist terror Yeltsin has unloosed.</p>

  <p>It should be remembered that after the Nazis took power in Germany, their foreign
  missions were under constant attack by anti-fascist and working-class organizations.
  Wherever Hitler's foreign minister went, he always encountered the wrath of
  anti-fascists. The lessons of that era should not be lost upon working-class
  organizations everywhere.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin's visit to Japan is as much a threadbare maneuver to divert public attention
  in Russia away from the struggle at home as it is an attempt to obtain loans and
  credits.</p>

  <p>For its part, the Japanese imperialist government is likely to raise once more,
  formally or informally, the issue of the Kurile Islands and demand their return to
  Japan, just as it did during Gorbachev's visit.</p>

  <p>It is of course not proper or diplomatic in bourgeois circles to raise an issue such
  as the Kurile Islands in economic negotiations. But because the Japanese capitalist
  press is likely to raise it in a vociferous manner, it is bound to come up.</p>

  <h4>Yeltsin's earlier stance</h4>

  <p>It was none other than Yeltsin who earlier did his utmost to undermine Gorbachev's
  effort to negotiate with the Japanese government. Yeltsin fanned the flames of Russian
  chauvinism on the question of returning the Kurile Islands to Japan.</p>

  <p>He led the chorus in the Russian press to be adamant and not surrender "our Russian
  brethren" in the Kurile Islands to the Japanese. Such jingoistic drivel is common in
  capitalist countries. Under these circumstances, it was quite impossible for Gorbachev
  to negotiate on behalf of his regime. It was no wonder he came home empty-handed.</p>

  <p>Now Yeltsin will use his crushing of the Russian opposition to demonstrate the
  stability of his regime to the imperialist government of Japan. Outrageous as it may
  seem, such measures are often demanded by imperialist governments in loan negotiations
  as collateral-security. It was something Gorbachev could not yet offer the Japanese
  imperialist government.</p>

  <p>In these negotiations, Yeltsin has the formal blessing of the Clinton
  administration. But the latter will not be happy if the negotiations between Yeltsin
  and the Japanese government go beyond loan arrangements that have been openly agreed
  upon. However, secret agreements are common in such negotiations.</p>

  <h4>Japanese ask: how stable is Yeltsin?</h4>

  <p>Gorbachev's effort to deal with the Japanese faltered mainly because of the
  instability of his regime, and the uncertainty which might follow were it to collapse.
  Now Yeltsin is in Japan, and the stability of his regime is also in question. His
  crushing of the Russian opposition by force and violence is not an indication of
  stability in the country.</p>

  <p>The measures Yeltsin has taken in the struggle to strengthen and retain his regime
  have a fascist character. He has resorted to illegal arrests, imprisonment of hundreds,
  the suspension of the progressive press, and the banning of progressive, working class
  and communist organizations.</p>

  <p>While at present he is able to retain his hold on the state apparatus, that is not
  the same as enjoying political support among the masses. The brutal manner in which he
  crushed the parliamentary opposition and the revolutionary workers engaged in that
  struggle is something that cannot but inspire the working-class movement with hatred,
  and is bound to culminate in open political opposition.</p>

  <p>It should also be remembered that the decisive working-class forces &mdash; the tens
  of millions of workers and collective peasantry &mdash; as well as large masses from
  intermediate strata of the population, were not involved in this struggle. The basic
  reserves of the working class remain intact.</p>

  <p>So far as the military is concerned, only the elite units of a special military
  detachment opened fire against the parliament and the workers.</p>

  <p>While the measures Yeltsin has taken are of a fascist character, they are not on the
  scale of the Hitlerite-Mussolini-Franco type of fascism. In each of those situations,
  the struggle was conducted more or less openly as an effort to destroy the power of the
  working class and its organizations. It involved mass struggle. Each of the contending
  classes was fully involved in the struggle. Each struggle ended in the annihilation of
  working-class, progressive and democratic organizations.</p>

  <p>This has not happened under the Yeltsin regime, nor is it likely to &mdash; unless
  certain other factors come into play.</p>

  <h4>Struggle over introducing capitalism</h4>

  <p>The Yeltsin-parliament struggle was of course a serious one. From this Marxists must
  deduce that it is at bottom a class struggle. The nature of every class struggle is
  bound up inextricably with economic objectives.</p>

  <p>What is the economic objective of the Yeltsin regime?</p>

  <p>It has been stated most openly and clearly by Yeltsin's prime minister, Yegor
  Gaidar. He made it clear that the objective was to go ahead, in an accelerated pace,
  with the economic reforms.</p>

  <p>And what is basically involved in these economic reforms? Is it a reform of the
  socialist system of production? No, of course not. The word "reform" is a misnomer. It
  is the introduction of capitalism.</p>

  <p>Starting piecemeal at first, the plan is to go "full steam ahead" after the
  destruction of the progressive, left and communist forces. The issue, ever since
  Gorbachev came in (and even earlier), has been which direction the Soviet economy
  should take: back to capitalism, or forward to socialist construction.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev maintained, especially in his first few years, that he was proposing the
  introduction of certain bourgeois reforms in order to strengthen the socialist system.
  Only gradually did it become obvious that he was moving &mdash; or being dragged along
  &mdash; into transforming the socialist economy into a capitalist one.</p>

  <p>Because of Gorbachev's supposedly slow pace, the Yeltsin forces pushed to move
  faster to capitalism, taking advantage of the disarray in the economy caused by the
  bourgeois "reforms." Eventually, they pushed Gorbachev aside, with the support of the
  imperialist bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev was being discredited by left, progressive forces as well as by the right
  wing, headed by Yeltsin. Thus, the ground was cut from under him completely.</p>

  <h4>Political danger in dismantling socialized industry</h4>

  <p>By this time it should be abundantly clear that Yeltsin is for the installation of a
  full-scale capitalist system. One would think that now, having at least temporarily
  defeated his opposition, he could move quickly to carry out the objectives of his
  political program and dismantle the socialized sector of the Russian economy.</p>

  <p>If that were an easy task he might have done it even if his political opposition
  remained legally in charge.</p>

  <p>But he has not been able to do so. Not just because of political interference from
  the left, progressive, communist and democratic forces, but because economically it is
  not a viable objective.</p>

  <p>The Russian bourgeoisie, and certainly the imperialist bourgeoisie, are for
  dismantling the economy, breaking it up into small units so as to make it possible to
  sell, resell or buy different parts of it. But over the years, since Gorbachev and
  Yeltsin have been in authority, that has not been a practical solution. It is like
  trying to break up a tremendous ocean liner into small boats and sell them at a profit.
  It can't be done.</p>

  <p>The tremendous industrial infrastructure &mdash; the huge oil, steel, auto,
  aviation, mining and space industries, for example &mdash; can't be split up and sold
  profitably. And no one but the biggest imperialists could even think of buying them
  whole.</p>

  <h4>Different process in China</h4>

  <p>The inability of the Gorbachev and Yeltsin administrations to institute the
  capitalist system as a whole differs fundamentally from the process that is apparently
  going on in China.</p>

  <p>In China, the introduction of capitalist zones is basically an industrialization
  process. It is the building up of the technological and economic infrastructure,
  especially in the coastal cities.</p>

  <p>True, agriculture has been decollectivized. But, in the main, there is as yet no
  dismantling of China's socialized technological infrastructure. The proletariat and the
  peasantry in China at this stage of development are being brought by the millions into
  industry.</p>

  <p>In Russia, on the contrary, furthering the transformation to capitalism must mean
  huge layoffs.</p>

  <p>The problem for Yeltsin is how to get the support of the workers when his
  dismantling process will result in tremendous layoffs &mdash; "downsizing," as it is
  termed in the U.S.</p>

  <p>The Yeltsin regime will continue to temporize for that very reason. This certainly
  will not find favor with the imperialists or the home bourgeoisie. From here on,
  Yeltsin has to calculate the political disadvantages of continuing with the process of
  dismantling socialized industry and provoking the masses to struggle. He can ill afford
  this, in view of the suppression of their organizations.</p>

  <h4>Independent working-class movement needed</h4>

  <p>The working-class organizations must orient themselves in an independent
  working-class direction &mdash; of course including the peasants. The policy of
  coalescing with bourgeoisie democracy has exhausted itself historically. There is no
  point in holding on to the coattails of the Rutskoi/Khasbulatov coalition. They have
  demonstrated an incapacity to mobilize the masses under their own banner. The road is
  therefore clear for militant, proletarian initiatives. A united front of communist
  organizations ought to be a prerequisite for organizing a massive working-class
  struggle to overthrow the Yeltsin regime.</p>
