  <h1>Significance of the Kirkland/Clinton meeting</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Dec. 23, 1993)</h5>

  <p>The conference on Dec. 10 between the leader of the AFL-CIO, Lane Kirkland, and
  President Bill Clinton was the first time in many years that a president of the United
  States has met with the official head of the trade union movement.</p>

  <p>If for no other reason than that the AFL-CIO represents 14.1 million organized
  workers and is the only labor organization that can speak authoritatively for the U.S.
  working class as a whole, the capitalist press should have given it wide publicity and
  reported at least the essential points of difference between Clinton and the
  AFL-CIO.</p>

  <p>As matters stand, the capitalist media boycotted the conference. Only one newspaper
  in New York reported on it, and that in an extremely tendentious, anti-labor manner. It
  focused on the union's opposition to the NAFTA treaty and the effort of the Clinton
  administration to begin what it calls "fence-mending" maneuvers to get labor back in
  his corner.</p>

  <h4>New mood in working class</h4>

  <p>It is not likely to happen. There is a new mood in the labor movement that is
  reaching all the way up to the top echelons of the trade unions. There are even signs
  of growing militancy in areas where the conservative labor leadership has been
  entrenched, such as in Memphis, Tenn.</p>

  <p>One must also take account of the flight attendants' strike, which signaled a real,
  though incipient, resurgence for labor as a whole, and won approval in all sectors of
  the labor movement.</p>

  <p>The conference between Kirkland and Clinton dealt with more than the NAFTA treaty,
  which the labor movement has opposed. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the
  vigorous opposition of the labor movement to the NAFTA treaty was the first and most
  important move on the part of the trade unions to take a position wholly independent
  not only of the capitalist administration but of the capitalist class as a whole.</p>

  <p>It was marred to some extent by the chauvinist slogan on the so-called exporting of
  jobs to Mexico. But later efforts by the trade union movement seemed to correct this,
  and the emphasis was mostly against big business and the reliance of the administration
  on right-wing Democrats and Republicans to support the treaty.</p>

  <h4>Emerging labor independence</h4>

  <p>The opposition to the treaty in itself is not as important as is the fact that the
  labor movement officially broke away from the capitalist administration and sought to
  carve out an independent position regarding the interests of the working class.</p>

  <p>Little attention has been paid to this development. It dwarfs anything that the
  official leadership of the trade union movement has done in many years. The taking of
  an independent class position amounts to a breaking of class collaboration with the
  ruling class.</p>

  <p>The history of the labor movement in this century has been mainly one of class
  collaboration with the capitalist government. A break with this tradition has to be
  regarded in a new light. It can be the harbinger of a redirection of U.S. labor
  politics and of the politics of the working class in an altogether different direction
  than the one pursued all these many years.</p>

  <p>The meeting itself ended in rancor, without the usual photo session between the
  president and the head of the AFL-CIO.</p>

  <p>It is easy for cynics in the bourgeois media and press to trivialize the meeting and
  harp on the rancor between Clinton and Kirkland. But this will soon be forgotten.</p>

  <p>One cannot forget, however, that Lane Kirkland is and always has been a conservative
  trade unionist, and Clinton is and always has been a staunch supporter of the ruling
  class. He is now its official representative, its chief executive.</p>

  <h4>Workers vs. capitalists: two classes</h4>

  <p>Nevertheless, in a sociological sense, Kirkland was at the meeting in his capacity
  as the representative of the working class and Clinton as the representative of the
  exploiting, oppressing ruling class. This is how the conference should have been
  explained in the press, if it were a free press instead of the communications tool of
  the capitalist class.</p>

  <p>What is the lasting significance, if any, of the Kirkland-Clinton meeting?</p>

  <p>It is the possible re-emergence of working class politics as the most significant
  factor in recent U.S. labor history. The meeting is demonstrative of the growing
  awareness of the emergence of class antagonisms. It is not the personality, not the
  individual that counts here. Those who dwell only on Kirkland's history will fail to
  see the forest for the trees and will confuse form with content.</p>

  <p>By the fate of history, Kirkland and Clinton represent two divergent classes: the
  working class and the bourgeoisie. One may be a conservative trade union leader and the
  other a minor Arkansas politician. Yet none of this detracts from the broader forces
  that they represent.</p>

  <p>What is it that has brought this extraordinary meeting at this particular time? It
  is not born of any desire of the labor movement to fix up this or that grievance, nor
  is it an attempt by Clinton to placate the trade union movement after he signed the
  NAFTA treaty in the face of labor's opposition.</p>

  <p>It is the consciousness on both sides that class antagonisms, long buried beneath
  class collaboration, are re-emerging. And that this could be destructive of capitalist
  stability in labor relations.</p>

  <p>The basic aim of the Clinton administration is to avoid a general outbreak of labor
  militancy, of which the American Airlines flight attendants' strike was a harbinger of
  the future. From the point of view of the union movement, as represented by Kirkland,
  the meeting was to bring to the fore the burning problem facing them: that traditional
  trade union strategies are becoming outmoded, and inapplicable, in the face of the
  growing aggressiveness of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <h4>New demands and tactics necessary</h4>

  <p>The trade union movement has come up against a problem which hitherto seemed to be
  solvable on the basis of the generally acceptable demands of the workers such as higher
  pay, better conditions, a shorter workweek. For many years that seemed to be the
  standard for combating any employer offensive against the workers. These demands were
  not incompatible with the further development of capitalism.</p>

  <p>At the present time, however, due to the nature of the restructuring of capitalist
  industry, these demands in and of themselves do not fundamentally address the problem
  of mass layoffs such as we have seen. These threaten to make the working class itself
  superfluous. In the words of Friedrich Engels, "the perfection of machinery is making
  human labor superfluous." (<em>Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</em>)</p>

  <p>The trade unions do not have an answer to the capitalist restructuring of industry
  as a whole. Merely protesting the layoffs or delaying them does not go to the heart of
  the scientific-technological revolution, which makes labor superfluous.</p>

  <h4>Capitalists, not workers, are superfluous</h4>

  <p>The answer of the Clintonites is to retrain the workers to do highly skilled jobs.
  But the highly skilled are just as vulnerable as the unskilled blue-collar worker. The
  progress of the scientific-technological revolution is not confined to the unskilled.
  There are many scientists and technicians who also suffer from the capitalist
  restructuring of industry.</p>

  <p>But the truth of the matter is that it is the capitalist class that is superfluous.
  The working class can run the industrial plant and equipment without the intervention
  of the ruling class. Whatever function the bourgeoisie had in the early stages of
  capitalism, when most of the workers had to be recruited from the illiterate peasantry,
  is no longer valid. The working class is now the bearer of all culture, including the
  best of bourgeois culture.</p>

  <p>The ever-growing importance of scientists and technicians attests to the fact that
  the ruling class, as administrator of the capitalist mode of production, is no longer
  necessary.</p>

  <h4>Clinton strategy: break with labor</h4>

  <p>It was no accident that when Clinton entered the primaries, he did not solicit the
  support of the trade unions. True, he accepted their support, but throughout the entire
  campaign he conducted himself quite conspicuously as a right-wing Democrat, leaning
  heavily on the moderate Democratic primary voters and eagerly seeking out Republican
  defectors to his camp.</p>

  <p>His primary campaign was a break with previous strategies and the general conduct of
  Democratic presidential aspirants. It was originally thought this was only a momentary
  right-wing departure by a candidate who would ultimately be forced to tread the usual
  route of strengthening his alliance with the labor movement as a broad base for
  launching his presidential campaign.</p>

  <p>While he accepted substantial trade union funds for the campaign, his entire course
  of electioneering had a distinctly right-wing, pro-Republican character to it, as far
  as propaganda goes.</p>

  <p>The trade union leadership tended to overlook this. But now, after he has been in
  office for almost a year, it has become plain that Clinton is removing himself from
  every vestige of traditional bourgeois liberalism, which previous candidates and
  presidents assiduously cultivated.</p>

  <p>It is not to be forgotten that his principal adviser on domestic politics, David
  Gergen, has been for years a key Republican strategist. On taking this post, he was
  egged on by reporters to say that he was changing his politics, to which Gergen firmly
  answered that he was not changing them at all.</p>

  <p>Still, the labor leadership had nothing at all to say about Gergen's appointment,
  although he was well known for his anti-labor bias.</p>

  <h4>No 'fence-mending' possible</h4>

  <p>The very symbolism of a high Republican strategist having a position of key
  significance in charge of the White House staff speaks volumes for the general
  political line of Clinton. He is pro-management all the way. Even the meeting between
  Kirkland and Clinton lacked even the most elementary courtesy. No handshake at the
  beginning or end of the conference. No photo session, which is usually one of the
  inducements for a White House meeting with the president.</p>

  <p>All this illustrates that even a fence-mending maneuver on both sides was not
  possible. The sharp difference in approach on the basic issues dividing the Clinton
  administration from the labor movement is too great and too serious to be covered up by
  a mere fence-mending maneuver between the two leaders. Hence, it is correct to state
  that the meeting was a failure on both sides.</p>

  <p>One thing has become patently clear. The labor movement always projected that the
  optimum conditions for its success would be to have a Democratic president and a
  Democratic majority in both houses of Congress. This has now been realized. But the
  results are the very opposite of what had been anticipated.</p>

  <p>This is an enormously stubborn fact that can not be papered over by a fence-mending
  meeting between Kirkland and Clinton. It demonstrates up to the hilt that collaborating
  with capitalist politicians as the mainstay for trade union leverage in the political
  struggle with the capitalist class has reached the point of no return.</p>

  <p>All those who are promoting a new meeting between Kirkland and Clinton merely
  demonstrate their fear of going it alone. But the fear is baseless.</p>

  <p>Breaking with capitalist politicians is but one aspect of the struggle, even under
  the best of conditions. What it all points up is the necessity of getting on the "high
  road" and relying on the numbers and the strength of the vast working class upon which
  the capitalist class depends for its source of profit.</p>

  <p>The labor movement has nothing to lose and everything to gain by reasserting its
  historical independence from capitalist politics. The break between Clinton and
  Kirkland could be the beginning of a mighty new development that will lift the vast
  trade union movement out of its passivity and open a new chapter in progressive,
  militant opposition to the heightened aggressiveness of big business.</p>

  <p>Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute warns that the labor movement
  will become isolated if it breaks with Clinton and fails to support him on such vital
  issues as health care and striker replacements. This is an altogether false position
  which over the years has been used by a variety of different groupings both inside and
  outside the labor movement to scare them from breaking with class collaboration.</p>

  <p>A close examination shows that Clinton is not the originator of any of this
  progressive legislation. These are issues which the labor movement has advanced over
  the years. Clinton has arrogated these issues to himself instead of honestly supporting
  labor's fight. The difference is fundamental.</p>

  <p>It is one thing when a president supports issues that the labor movement brings up;
  it is another matter when he arrogates them to himself, fundamentally changes them, and
  then asks the labor movement to support him.</p>

  <h4>Break class collaboration</h4>

  <p>The fear that if labor breaks with the administration all kinds of anti-worker
  legislation will pass and everything will be lost is one of these canards that has to
  be answered in the same manner and spirit as the early class struggles in the United
  States. The Wagner Act, the National Labor Relations Act and all the subsequent
  progressive labor legislation came as the result of the struggle. It was the struggle
  that made possible the pro-labor legislation.</p>

  <p>From this we must draw the conclusion, validated by historical experience, that the
  break with class collaboration which is inherent in the breakup of the conference
  between Kirkland and Clinton is definite and should not be papered over by sometimes
  well-meaning but utterly useless and false messiahs from the liberal bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>For the militant and class-conscious elements in the country, it offers an
  opportunity to view the organized labor movement in a new perspective. The problem is
  how to position itself in the light of the fact that this is only the beginning of a
  great breakaway from historic class collaboration and the beginnings of class
  politics.</p>

  <h4>New phase of capitalist development</h4>

  <p>Undoubtedly efforts will be made at conciliation, at bringing back the old tradition
  of tying the labor movement to the chariot wheel of finance capital. This was possible
  for a protracted period of time as a result of the favorable position of U.S. monopoly
  capitalism in the world struggle.</p>

  <p>But there is now a new phase of development. It is regressive and degenerative. By
  contrast, all previous developments in capitalist production raised not just the level
  of capitalist technique but ultimately (although not without class struggle) the level
  of benefits for the working class as a whole.</p>

  <p>This new development of capitalism brings in its train massive layoffs resulting
  from structural capitalist developments, a new phenomenon whose origins are traced in
  our book "High Tech, Low Pay" (Sam Marcy, 1986, World View Publishers). The easy road
  of seeking material gain for the working class via negotiation with capital, enlisting
  the goodwill and the services of capitalist politicians whose campaigns were well
  financed by the trade unions, is coming to an end.</p>

  <p>In the days before the civil rights struggle began in earnest, the so-called
  progressive Democratic and early Republican administrations were looked upon as the
  saviors of what was left of the progressive legislation from the period of
  Reconstruction. One only has to remember that from the year 1880 or thereabouts until
  even the late 1950s, civil rights advocates in the U.S. Congress put up a sort of
  battle for an anti-lynching bill from year to year, from Congress to Congress.</p>

  <p>The legislative struggle did not accomplish its objective. What ended the lynchings
  in the South was the rise of the civil rights struggle, the mass movement. The
  enactment of the civil rights bill in the late 1960s is almost universally regarded as
  the product of the struggle and not merely of legislative battles. The anti-lynching
  bill died aborning.</p>

  <p>"The worker in the white skin will never be liberated as long as the worker in the
  Black skin is branded," wrote Karl Marx. This is a key facet in the struggle for the
  unity of the working class. How indispensable such unity is becomes obvious in every
  type of struggle. No labor movement can make progress unless it makes Black-white unity
  the top priority on its agenda.</p>

  <p>Only a broad united front which goes beyond the narrow strata of the trade unions
  and reaches out to all the masses, the millions of Black, white, Latin, women and men,
  gay and straight, will fructify and enrich the struggle. All over the world oppressed
  workers will look to the U.S. from a new perspective, as the land not of capitalist
  opportunities but of working-class struggle.</p>
