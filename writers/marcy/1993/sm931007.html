  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Solzhenitsyn and Yeltsin (Oct. 7, 1993)</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Solzhenitsyn and Yeltsin</h1>

  <h2>'Down with the revolution!' of 1789?</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Oct. 7, 1993)</h5>

  <p>How interesting that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the admirer and chronicler of the
  czarist aristocracy, should suddenly leave his seclusion in Vermont and surface in
  France to lend a hand to the Yeltsin counter-revolutionary forces in Russia. But he has
  to do it his own way, mutilating historical epochs to suit counter-revolutionary
  purposes.</p>

  <p>Speaking in Lucs-sur-Boulogne, Solzhenitsyn said the French Revolution had been a
  mistake. He cited the violence of the revolution to prove his point. "It would be vain
  to hope that revolution can regenerate human nature," he said. He went on to lecture
  the French, "It's what your revolution, and particularly the Russian Revolution, had
  hoped for so much." (New York Times, Sept. 27)</p>

  <p>Liberty, equality and fraternity, said the author of the much-touted book <em>The
  Gulag Archipelago,</em> are "intrinsically contradictory and unfeasible. Liberty
  destroys social equality. Equality restrains liberty."</p>

  <p>Solzhenitsyn is a little late with his criticism. This theme has been raised many
  times since the French Revolution. It took Frederick Engels, however, to show that, to
  the bourgeoisie, these slogans symbolized freedom of trade, freedom for private
  property and freedom to exploit the workers. Law can never be higher than the social
  system that begets it.</p>

  <p>It's fine to talk against violence. It meant one thing when such truly great people
  as the utopian socialist Saint-Simon abjured violence, because he drew the conclusion
  that industry and commerce should be in the hands of the people. Instead of prating
  about abjuring violence, he erected an economic program that favored the masses.</p>

  <p>But Solzhenitsyn's program is that of the exploiting and oppressing bourgeoisie.
  Just talking about violence in the abstract conceals rather than reveals the nature of
  the bourgeois system of private ownership.</p>

  <h4>What French Revolution accomplished</h4>

  <p>Solzhenitsyn made his remarks while helping "a conservative lawmaker, Philippe de
  Villiers, and other officials unveil a plaque commemorating massacres in the Vendee
  Department on the Atlantic coast during the Reign of Terror of 1793-94," the Times
  said.</p>

  <p>What was this Reign of Terror? It was the emergence of a revolutionary dictatorship
  of the petty-bourgeoisie in France in the struggle against the monarchy, the nobility,
  the landlords and the clergy &mdash; the so-called first estate.</p>

  <p>What was the ultimate historic outcome that Solzhenitsyn and others of his ilk
  reject so much, supposedly because of its violence? The outcome of the revolutionary
  dictatorship was to sweep away the feudal system with a speed and thoroughness that to
  this very day mark the French Revolution as one of the most remarkable, epochal
  developments in history.</p>

  <p>It took a revolutionary dictatorship to do what otherwise might have taken decades,
  if not centuries, to accomplish. It laid the basis for the growth and development of
  the French bourgeoisie. Without that great revolution, they might today be of no
  greater significance than their counterparts in either Portugal or Spain.</p>

  <p>But the great French Revolution is not Solzhenitsyn's main target. His most venomous
  attacks are leveled at the Russian Revolution.</p>

  <p>For that is the first revolution in history that swept away not only the remains of
  the feudal nobility and landlords &mdash; but also, in a great historic first,
  expropriated the bourgeoisie and elevated the working class and peasants to the status
  of the ruling class. This set in motion a train of events that to this day constitutes
  the focus of the world struggle.</p>

  <p>While Solzhenitsyn was in France attacking the French Revolution, his fellow
  emigr&sbquo; and close personal friend Mstislav Rostropovich was in Moscow conducting a
  concert by the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington in Red Square. According to
  the Times, this concert had been organized as "a free cultural offering to Russians who
  had neither the money nor the connections to get tickets for the orchestra's
  performances in the Conservatory." It was shown on television here as a large rally for
  Boris Yeltsin, who worked the crowd.</p>

  <p>Even in its choice of music &mdash; Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture" commemorating
  czarism's triumph over Napoleon &mdash; this cultural event was in sync with the
  counterrevolutionary themes so dear to Solzhenitsyn.</p>

  <h4>Yeltsin vs. parliament</h4>

  <p>The current struggle between the Yeltsin counterrevolution on the one hand and the
  parliament on the other reflects only in the most tenuous manner a struggle between the
  basic classes in Russian society today. What is the struggle's overall objective
  significance? What is it really about?</p>

  <p>Is it about who shares the political plums in a new historical setting? Of course it
  is, but this is only a surface manifestation.</p>

  <p>At bottom &mdash; and this is the main difficulty that confronts Yeltsin as well as
  his opponents in the parliament &mdash; are the forms of property ownership first
  established by the Russian Revolution of 1917: the socialized industries and collective
  and state farms. How can Yeltsin proceed to institute his bourgeois program, the
  program of establishing a capitalist state, when the social foundation on which his
  grouping rests is completely at variance with his political program?</p>

  <p>It is now about seven years since the Gorbachev regime tentatively began the process
  of dismantling the socialist forms of property. Yeltsin promised to do it much faster
  and more thoroughly. Yet he finds it most difficult to do so.</p>

  <p>First, there is the masses' inherent antagonism to such a program. Second is
  Yeltsin's inability to forthrightly state his program with clarity instead of hemming
  and hawing while conducting a political vendetta against the parliament.</p>

  <p>The latter is the presumed supporter of socialist property. But it can't say so
  clearly and distinctly in a way the masses can understand so ways can be found to rally
  them in the struggle against the Yeltsin counterrevolution.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the struggle, discounting the many vicissitudes and the coverups
  between the contestants, lies the real issue: Shall Russia continue its economic and
  political development on the basis of retaining the socialist form of property in the
  basic industries and all their subsidiaries? Or shall it open up a giant offensive to
  dismantle them and bring back bourgeois private property?</p>

  <h4>U.S. unsure of the outcome</h4>

  <p>Bush's CIA director, Robert Gates, in an estimate of the current situation, says
  that this kind of struggle can go on for decades. Yes, perhaps so &mdash; but only on
  the utterly improbable condition that the masses, the tens of millions of workers in
  the vast industrial complex of Russia and in the collective farms, will continue to be
  passive. But this is taking an utterly unhistorical view of the situation.</p>

  <p>A situation of the kind that prevails in Russia cannot but awaken the mass
  consciousness of the workers and dispose of the struggle between Yeltsin and the
  parliament as a relic of the past.</p>

  <p>The cautiousness with which the U.S. deals with Yeltsin and the meagerness of the
  funds it lends or donates to his clique demonstrates its own uncertainty over the
  outcome of the struggle. They are talking now about speeding up a loan of $50 million
  to the Yeltsin group. For a vast country such as Russia, $50 million is really a
  piddling sum and can do nothing but help pay some of the Yeltsin administration's
  current bills.</p>
