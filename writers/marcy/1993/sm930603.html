  <h1>Perspective on China</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (June 3, 1993)</h5>

  <p>Once again, China is shaking the world. This time, however, it is not experiencing a
  great revolutionary convulsion like the Peiping Rebellion of the 1850s, the May 4th
  Movement, The Canton and Shanghai Communes of the late 1920s, the establishment of the
  People's Republic of china, or the Cultural Revolution. These events shook the
  capitalist world to its foundations and inspired revolutionary struggles of oppressed
  people all over the world.</p>

  <p>The latest development, while it is shaking up U.S. imperialism, is of a very
  different type,. It is by all standards mundane and draws the attention of a narrow
  stratum of the bourgeoisie. Nevertheless, it may in the long run be of decisive
  importance.</p>

  <h4>A surge of production</h4>

  <p>It has become plain in the last few months that there has been a phenomenal surge of
  production in China. Capitalist accounts here tell us that China's economy is likely to
  expand at a rate of 13 percent this year, after a similar growth rate in 1992.</p>

  <p>It is alarming the bourgeoisie here. They express concern over the plague of
  inflation, which of course would erode the economic gains. But why would the
  bourgeoisie here worry about that? The truth of the matter is they are far more worried
  that China has demonstrated its capacity to produce in great quantity and can compete
  to some extent with Western capitalism in the production certain goods, if not
  services.</p>

  <p>China's growth rate has come to the fore in the capitalist press just at a time when
  the Clinton administration is to decide whether to allow Chinese imports on the same
  basis as before, or whether to utilize a provision of the Jackson-Vanik law that gives
  the president authority to ban them by imposing onerous restrictions.</p>

  <h4>New method shows much bigger economy</h4>

  <p>Whether in collaboration with the U.S. government or not, the New York Times
  disclosed on May 20 that a new calculation of the world economies catapults China into
  third place in world production, exceeded only by the U.S. and Japan. It is, of course,
  a remarkable feat.</p>

  <p>Under the new method, based on the purchasing power of a country's currency at home
  rather than its value on international exchanges, China's gross domestic product in
  1991 was calculated at $1.66 trillion, as against only $370 billion using the old
  method.</p>

  <p>Why the sudden change in methodology? Was it to do China a favor? Did China ask for
  it? Possible, but that is doubtful.</p>

  <p>Under the new method, if China needs loans from the IMF or the G-7 imperialist
  nations, the interest would be based on a different formula. Now that china is no
  longer categorized as one of the poorest countries, it is not eligible for certain
  kinds of debt relief.</p>

  <p>All this may seem like small potatoes, but in fact the imperialists are quite
  disturbed by China's ability to expand its production at such a fast rate.</p>

  <h4>Different from Gorbachev's reforms</h4>

  <p>China's economic growth is based upon the introduction of capitalist reforms similar
  to those introduced in Eastern Europe and the former USSR. This can scarcely be
  disputed.</p>

  <p>The difference, according to Chinese sources, is that the reforms are working and
  that the growth in production is the biggest boon to the Chinese people since the
  revolution triumphed in 1949.</p>

  <p>However, it is important to differentiate China's reforms from the way capitalist
  practices were introduced in the USSR. It is now seven years since Mikhail Gorbachev
  began to experiment with market reforms. The result has not been a socialist
  modernization of the industrial and agricultural apparatus but a dismantling of
  socialist projects in industry and in agriculture. Indeed, it has resulted in a
  breakdown, a vandalizing, of the achievements of socialist construction in an effort to
  bring about a restoration of capitalism.</p>

  <p>In China, however, as best as we can see from here, there has been a rapid
  development of industry, a tremendous surge in the construction of hundreds of
  industrial projects, rather than the dismantling of existing socialist projects with a
  view to privatization, as has been going on in the former USSR.</p>

  <p>However, China's industrial growth is being carried out openly and unabashedly on a
  capitalist basis. And it is going forward at a very rapid rate, even exceeding the
  objectives of China's economic planners.</p>

  <p>As we pointed out in last week's Workers World, production under capitalism, except
  when it is interrupted by crisis, natural disasters or war, can and does rise to
  phenomenal heights, exceeding all previous modes of production. Raising production is
  not a huge, let alone formidable, problem under capitalism. The problem lies in the
  antagonism between private ownership and the social character of production.</p>

  <p>Since the bourgeois counter-revolution, however, a rise in production has not been
  achieved in what was the USSR. Just the opposite. This is because the objective of the
  reformers there is not to increase production but to privatize the existing means of
  production, and there is tremendous opposition to that. The difference must be kept in
  mind.</p>

  <h4>Struggle over trade</h4>

  <p>During the Bush administration, an opinion piece in the New York Times by Leslie
  Gelb communicated a threat to China that it was vulnerable to having its coastal
  provinces detached from the rest of the country. These are the areas where the
  free-market "special economic zones" are located. The threat was meant to force China
  to accommodate to the U.S. on matters regarding "human rights" &mdash; a code name for
  allowing counterrevolutionary activity.</p>

  <p>However, Bush was opposed to tightening trade restrictions on China, notwithstanding
  the uproar by the Democratic Party faction in Congress. Clinton, on the other hand,
  attached Bush's stand on China during the election campaign and called for new
  restrictions on trade.</p>

  <p>Now Clinton finds himself in the same position as Bush. He has changed his position
  and is opposed to giving so-called human rights pre-eminence over trade with China.
  Once again, economics determines politics and not vice versa.</p>

  <h4>Class character of China</h4>

  <p>The growing influence of the capitalist market in China has occasioned economists
  and political leaders on both sides of the Pacific to give consideration to a class
  definition of China's social structure and state. For instance, last year the Congress
  of the Communist Party characterized China as a "socialist market economy."</p>

  <p>It is well known by all students of Marxist economics that the two terms are
  incompatible with each other. China has had a planned economy. How well or poorly it
  has been doing is not the issue. The fact is that it instituted a planned economy soon
  after the revolution's triumph in 1949. The kernel of a planned economy has persisted
  through all the struggles and turmoil since.</p>

  <p>A capitalist market economy is not planned, but is spontaneous, unpredictable,
  chaotic. The capitalist class everywhere is lyrical about the freedom of the market,
  about how it sets free prices and production. But this should not be taken as literally
  true. Monopoly capitalism restricts capitalist trade and production.</p>

  <p>For example, no country can sell its goods in the U.S. without abiding by
  restrictions imposed by the U.S. government. In fact, all capitalist governments put
  restrictions on so-called free trade.</p>

  <p>The U.S., Canada and Mexico are working hard on an agreement to establish a free
  trade zone at this late date in their historical development. However, before this law
  is enacted in the three countries, it will have many, many restrictions placed on it to
  suit the interests of the three contracting parties.</p>

  <p>Of course, no working class organization has had a say in any of this. The agreement
  should be opposed in the interest of international working class solidarity.</p>

  <p>A market economy by definition is generally understood to be the very opposite of a
  planned economy. The two terms are incompatible with each other. But that does not
  necessarily exclude the possibility of their coexistence within the framework of a
  national state for a period of time.</p>

  <p>In fact, such a situation was created in the years closely following the Bolshevik
  Revolution. Under far different circumstances than exist today in China, the capitalist
  market was reintroduced for a time, even as plans were laid for the building of a
  socialist economy.</p>

  <h4>GATT enters the debate</h4>

  <p>The question of the class character of China's state and of the reforms has
  undoubtedly caused a great deal of debate in China. Nor is it of theoretical or
  political significance in China alone. For instance, the organization known as the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is by no means an innocent bystander watching
  the debate in China. GATT is an organization set up by the imperialists that includes
  105 countries. It says in so many words: If you want to trade with any one of us, you
  have to abide by certain rules that we set.</p>

  <p>Under GATT's rules, devised some years, ago, China, the USSR, Eastern Europe, Cuba,
  the DPRK, Vietnam and a few other countries could not become members unless they agreed
  to certain restrictions. Such as free trade.</p>

  <p>China is undoubtedly trying very hard to meet those restrictions and get into GATT.
  An article in the Wall Street Journal of March 3, entitled "Chinese Entry into GATT Is
  Stalled by Thorny Socialist Market Economy," explains that the officials of GATT,
  servants of the seven imperialists, have asked China to describe precisely what it
  means by "socialist market economy." Part of the debate in China over this term is
  precisely over how to meet the restrictions of GATT.</p>

  <p>Thus the struggle over the class characterization of China's economy and state is
  not solely a debate among so-called doctrinaire communists, it reaches into the summits
  of the capitalist government as well.</p>

  <h4>Agriculture since the communes</h4>

  <p>If China is to be called a socialist country, what about the class character of the
  agricultural system? China has a vast population of peasants and a minority of workers.
  In the early 1960s, after collectivization, the commune was established as the unit of
  agricultural production. Farm work was elevated to collective labor, and private
  ownership of the land was abolished.</p>

  <p>The dismantling of the communes in the 1980s signified that agriculture in the main
  returned to private ownership.</p>

  <p>The rationale for dismantling the communes was that they were inefficient. The
  peasants held back their production. But the private property incentives accelerated
  production. The peasants sold to the state their product over and above what they
  needed to sustain themselves and the state paid them accordingly. This was said to
  raise agricultural production and benefit all of China.</p>

  <p>But recently the government has been unable to pay the peasants in Chinese currency
  and instead has paid with i.o.u.'s which are not negotiable or redeemable. This has
  raised the spectrum of peasant protests, if not rebellions.</p>

  <p>Either because of crop failures, natural disasters, or the inability to sustain
  themselves on the farm, peasants in China are now flooding into the cities in a manner
  similar to that in many Third World countries. This has made it possible to employ
  millions in industrial projects.</p>

  <p>One may say that what is going on in China is a period of industrialization similar
  to that in England in the last century. The millions who were dispossessed from the
  land made cheap labor in industry possible and profitable. Marx described the horrors
  of early industrial development, including the employment of women and children for
  long hours, in his illuminating chapter in "Capital" on primitive accumulation.</p>

  <h4>A planned economy?</h4>

  <p>China's collectivized and nationalized property in industry has become weakened as a
  result of both the privatization of agriculture and the institution of capitalist
  reforms.</p>

  <p>Is China today a planned economy in the sense that the basic elements of production
  and consumption as planned and that the operations are pursuant a given plan?</p>

  <p>The answer at the present time is no. The introduction of bourgeois reforms inhibits
  full-scale planning, so that to a large extent it is becoming a commodity producing
  economy. The larger the special economic zones, the larger the capitalist reforms, the
  more China becomes a commodity-producing economy and not a planned socialist
  economy.</p>

  <p>However, China's history since the beginning of the 19th century has been full of
  convulsions as it has attempted to free itself from imperialist domination. It has also
  fought to remain a centralized national state with a degree of autonomy for the
  provinces. Were each province to decide for itself how and what it would produce, a
  planned economy for the state as a whole would be impossible.</p>

  <p>Immediately before and during the Tienanmen Square days, China appeared to be in
  danger of disintegrating into warlordism. This was overcome and the decentralizing
  process that threatened to emerge was eliminated. That was a victory of socialism.</p>

  <p>The question of how far the Chinese government can go with the capitalist reforms
  will certainly be up for review, notwithstanding a constitutional provision meant to
  make the reforms a permanent feature in Chinese society.</p>

  <p>One fact has certainly emerged: the millions who left the rural areas for the great
  cities of China and were absorbed into the proletariat have given the Chinese
  government and Communist Party the opportunity to strengthen the socialist character of
  the state. The growth of the proletariat is the objective factor most needed for the
  building of socialism.</p>

  <p>It's important that the process of production be carried out in the spirit of
  socialist construction. The calculations of the bourgeoisie are that as a result of
  their widening influence in the special economic zones, they will ultimately overwhelm
  the socialist sector in China. They believe that the socialist sector, lacking the
  material conditions necessary for its growth, including skilled labor and specialists,
  will be stillborn. The alternative, they say, is massive material assistance from the
  imperialists, and this will undo socialist construction.</p>

  <p>For the moment, the Party seems to be united on going forward with the reforms
  because they are bringing results deemed indispensable at the present time. Without a
  doubt, a generation of young people, a new breed of Tienanmen Square elements, is being
  accommodated politically to this situation. But the inevitability of a capitalist
  recession, especially if it stems from a worldwide capitalist crisis, is bound to
  create a classic confrontation between the socialized and the bourgeois sectors.</p>

  <p>The question is how significant is the proletarian revolutionary element, what is
  their influence in the higher councils of the Party? Even if they are tiny and weak
  now, the objective basis for their revolutionary growth is assured.</p>

  <p>As Frederick Engels explained in <em>Socialism, Utopian and Scientific</em> (part of
  his book <em>Anti-Duhring</em>), the great philosophers of the 18th-century
  Enlightenment &mdash; Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Saint-Simon &mdash; reflected
  the disillusionment with the old order and tore to shreds feudal ideology with their
  brilliance and wit. On the other hand, socialism is the ideological offspring of the
  growth of the proletariat.</p>

  <p>China had its own Enlightenment period that undermined feudal ideology. The period
  in which the proletariat comes forward with its own ideological approach has been more
  protracted, given the necessity to fight imperialism on all fronts and a more obdurate
  and stultified feudal system.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, with all its ups and downs, China is moving toward socialism. The
  efforts of the imperialists to stop it by force and violence have failed over the
  decades, and their efforts at economic strangulation will also surely fail. The road to
  socialism in China, like everywhere else in the world, may be difficult, but it is
  assured.</p>
