  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: The specter of fascism (Dec.30, 1993)</title>

  <h1>The specter of fascism</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Dec.30, 1993)</h5>

  <p><em>The following is adapted from a speech Workers World Party Chairperson Sam Marcy
  gave at a party meeting in New York Dec. 16.</em></p>

  <p>Today a process is taking shape in Russia that, if it goes to its logical
  conclusion, is likely to change the character of the international situation and bring
  in its train many internal developments in countries throughout the world.</p>

  <p>The recent elections, and particularly the vote for Vladimir Zhirinovsky's so-called
  Liberal Democratic Party, have raised an urgent question: What is really going on in
  what we used to call the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics?</p>

  <p>What has alarmed the ruling class and, of course, important sections of the workers,
  not the least of which are the vanguard communist organizations?</p>

  <p>The great socialist October Revolution of 1917 opened up the era of the dictatorship
  of the proletariat and the peasantry. That changed the face of the globe. It threatened
  to overturn capitalist regimes all over the world.</p>

  <p>It made it possible to build strong communist parties, including one in the United
  States. For many years it dominated events throughout the whole world.</p>

  <p>For the first time in human history, a proletarian dictatorship of the workers and
  peasants took power with the fundamental aim of changing the class structure of
  society. That is what the Russian Revolution stood for.</p>

  <p>And the fires of that revolution continue to shake up the capitalist system even
  today.</p>

  <p>Now the process that started in 1917 with the dictatorship of the proletariat and
  peasantry &mdash; which became such a threat to the ruling classes of the world &mdash;
  seems to be moving in the direction of the full-scale dictatorship of the
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>That is what the struggle is about now in Russia.</p>

  <h4>Threat of fascist dictatorship</h4>

  <p>The struggle is over whether the process begun 75 years ago is finally and
  conclusively reaching the stage where that revolution will become completely negated on
  the basis of establishing a bourgeois dictatorship. And not one that is democratic in
  form, but an open fascist dictatorship able to complete the process of taking back from
  the workers, peasants and mass of the population all they had won.</p>

  <p>The U.S. ruling class is seemingly very much alarmed by this and wholly opposed to
  it. But that is a poor reading of the situation. The U.S. is alarmed &mdash; but
  because this is taking place without its consent, without its connivance, and entirely
  independent of the U.S. capitalist government and ruling class.</p>

  <p>The U.S. ruling class was taken by surprise. For the first time there has arisen in
  Russia a bourgeois grouping that is wholly antagonistic to the U.S. on foreign
  policy.</p>

  <p>The U.S. ruling class is worried not because the Zhirinovsky group is fascist or
  anti-Semitic, but because it is orienting in the direction of independence from U.S.
  interests and ruling groups.</p>

  <p>We should go over, to the extent that it is possible to do so in a short time, the
  difference between a fascist dictatorship and a bourgeois democracy &mdash; two
  different forms of bourgeois rule.</p>

  <p>Bourgeois democracy exists in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
  Japan &mdash; in nearly all the imperialist countries. It also exists in many Third
  World or oppressed countries, although they are more restricted by the influence of
  U.S. capital and their governments take the form of a military dictatorship here or
  there.</p>

  <p>Fascism in its ultimate form means the complete negation of bourgeois democracy.</p>

  <h4>Bourgeois democracy won in struggle</h4>

  <p>In the eyes of the overwhelming majority of the working class, bourgeois democracy
  is democracy, period. But even bourgeois democracy is a great advance over what
  previously existed in this country and everywhere else.</p>

  <p>Bourgeois democracy is not a gift from the ruling class. It was won in struggle. A
  capitalist democracy, whether in Britain or France or other countries, is the result of
  working-class struggles that have forced the bourgeoisie to grant democratic
  rights.</p>

  <p>For all too long there were no rights for the masses in this country. Only
  property-owning white men could vote. Native people had no rights. In a great section
  of the U.S. there was chattel slavery. Even after Abolition, Black people had no rights
  at all for many years. Women couldn't vote.</p>

  <p>It was only in 1971 that every citizen at least 18 years old was legally
  enfranchised, although registration is still made difficult enough to discourage
  many.</p>

  <p>So this democracy we have was earned in the course of struggle, including a bloody
  civil war. Bourgeois politicians, however, give the impression that it is part of the
  "benefits of capitalism."</p>

  <p>But capitalism and democracy are not synonymous. Democracy is a form of state, as is
  fascism. The essence of a capitalist state is the rule of the bourgeoisie. Capitalism
  as a system can exist without capitalist democracy.</p>

  <p>The working-class movement can thrive and advance if it utilizes capitalist
  democracy to its own advantage in the struggle to bring about a socialist
  revolution.</p>

  <p>This introduction is necessary because the bourgeoisie never refer to the real
  significance of the struggle between bourgeois democracy and fascism. They always give
  the impression that they are in the forefront of the struggle against fascism and are
  the proponents of democracy.</p>

  <p>There is nothing the bourgeoisie like so much as to cover themselves with sugary,
  unctuous phrases about democracy as long as it seems to serve their ends &mdash; and as
  long as the workers don't use that democracy for their own class interests, but only to
  advance this or that capitalist politician.</p>

  <p>Full-scale fascism means the complete abolition of capitalist democracy. That has
  happened several times in this century. We must refer to them or we won't understand
  what is happening in Russia. The experiences in some of the countries of Europe give us
  object lessons in what fascism is.</p>

  <h4>Lessons of fascism in Europe</h4>

  <p>The earliest form of fascism took place in Italy. Later, it took over in Germany and
  then in Spain.</p>

  <p>Why did it come first in those countries? It is often explained as due to the
  development of a dictatorial mentality in certain individual leaders.</p>

  <p>It is said that in Italy it was all Mussolini's fault; that in Germany it was
  Hitler; and that Franco brought about fascism in Spain. The emphasis is always on the
  individual and not on the social basis for the rise of that individual.</p>

  <p>We do not deny the role of the individual in history. But we ask ourselves why it is
  that in these particular countries, individuals were able to turn a bourgeois democracy
  into a fascist dictatorship.</p>

  <p>Is it because they were unusual and extraordinary people? Why didn't they do
  something else? Why didn't they bring about a greater democracy &mdash; a socialist
  democracy? As individuals, how did they build a following strong enough to take
  power?</p>

  <p>The individual becomes important, most of all, if he or she is a representative of a
  class.</p>

  <p>Some capitalist historians will say fascism came as a result of deep economic
  crisis. That is true, but it is not the whole truth. Poverty is deeply embedded in so
  many countries, but that does not necessarily bring a fascist dictatorship. The worst
  economic crisis that ever took place was in the United States, and it did not bring
  about a fascist dictatorship. Some fascist groupings did arise, but on the whole
  fascism did not take hold here.</p>

  <p>But it did in three leading capitalist countries: Germany, Italy, and Spain.</p>

  <p>What was their common social and political denominator?</p>

  <h4>What turns the bourgeoisie into fascists</h4>

  <p>The first prerequisite of classical fascism is the existence of a revolutionary mood
  in the working class.</p>

  <p>In Italy, Spain and Germany there was a revolutionary situation. The working class
  was on the edge of a socialist revolution. That is what impelled the bourgeoisie to
  support a fascist dictatorship in its most brutal and complete form.</p>

  <p>In these three capitalist countries, the working class had learned to use capitalist
  democracy to defend its own interests to some extent. There were entrenched elected
  representatives of workers' parties. They controlled a number of cities and states,
  were in the legislatures and sometimes in the federal government.</p>

  <p>Wherever you went in Europe, socialists and communists had some part in the
  capitalist state. The workers' movement was strong and seemed unvanquishable.</p>

  <p>Under the democratic form of the capitalist state, the workers' movement had reached
  a stage in its development where it had become a threat to the very existence of
  capitalist rule. Even Frederick Engels thought at one point at the end of the 19th
  century that the workers' movement would take over in Germany. It was the general
  understanding that as a result of parliamentary means the workers' movement would
  ultimately rule.</p>

  <p>But that turned out to be an illusion.</p>

  <p>The ruling class could not easily overcome the great achievements of the working
  class by mere elections. Even if they could win absolute majorities in a few elections,
  they could not fundamentally change the class position of the working class. So much
  had been won that it would take a military struggle to change it. That is where fascism
  came in.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie in a number of European countries turned in an utterly different
  direction. Instead of being the patron saint of bourgeois democracy, they slowly and
  gradually gravitated toward a violent break with that tradition.</p>

  <p>They began to instigate movements for the overthrow of capitalist democracy
  altogether, as a means to abolish the gains of the workers, and revamp and redesign the
  form of class rule. Their objective was to develop on a world scale and become the most
  aggressive group of capitalist countries in order to redivide the colonies in their
  favor.</p>

  <h4>Personality of leaders not decisive</h4>

  <p>The development of fascism didn't have anything to do with the psychological bent of
  leaders. It didn't have anything to do with an aversion to liberty, free speech and the
  like.</p>

  <p>It had to do with the necessity to sustain the rule of a particular class over
  another class, to sustain capitalism when it is very much under siege from the
  workers.</p>

  <p>The enormous strength of the workers' organizations on the European arena had
  frightened the bourgeoisie. The confidence of the workers' movement was such that they
  were openly speaking not only about the overthrow of the bourgeoisie but also how they
  would soon govern over society. It was just a matter of time before the ruling class
  would be out of business.</p>

  <p>When a ruling class sees its most substantial interests under siege, it doesn't care
  much about democracy, freedom, or anything else. It is ready to stake its all on
  retaining its system, even to the point of the loss of millions of lives. It will think
  of its class interests above all and will throw overboard everything it has taught
  about democracy, freedom, god, or whatever &mdash; in the interest of retaining its
  class position.</p>

  <p>This is how the fascist movements developed. Not as an automatic, anti-democratic
  tendency, but because of the ruling class's organic need to save its class interests
  and system.</p>

  <h4>What led to Mussolini's takeover</h4>

  <p>The first to go over was Italy. The working class was strong in Italy. Even the
  monarchy did not stand in the way of the workers' organizing. When it did, it was
  soundly trounced. The workers' movement was also reaching out to the peasants.</p>

  <p>In the years immediately after the Russian Revolution, the Italian masses tried to
  take it all. They organized general strikes and tried to take over all of industry by
  occupying the plants. They wanted to make short shrift of the slow, eventual growth of
  the working class &mdash; particularly in a country that was not the richest and whose
  colonies did not bring in the kind of super-profits that Britain, for example,
  enjoyed.</p>

  <p>Under those circumstances, the ruling class instigated the development of fascism by
  sponsoring Mussolini to open a violent struggle against the working class.</p>

  <p>Bourgeois historians write a lot about Mussolini. But they will not tell you how the
  ruling class conducted itself, what the bankers and industrialists did. What were they
  doing while the workers were making gains?</p>

  <p>Even if Mussolini had organized the fascist coup d'etat on his own, his subsequent
  stay in power shows support by the ruling class in Italy and by the imperialists as a
  whole. His march on Rome to "rescue Italy from Bolshevism" and his Black Shirts would
  have been a temporary thing with no importance had big capital not supported him.</p>

  <p>So the first characteristic in the development of a fascist regime of the classical
  type is the existence of a revolutionary situation caused by the rise of a workers'
  movement. This in turn causes the capitalist ruling class to abandon capitalist
  democracy and turn to naked force and violence in the struggle to retain its rule.</p>

  <p>True, a fascist dictatorship means that even the bourgeoisie has to give up certain
  of its rights. Nonetheless, the results of fascism everywhere were to strengthen the
  ruling class as against the working class.</p>

  <p>In Italy, this classical form of fascism existed from 1922 all the way up to the end
  of the Second World War, when the workers overthrew Mussolini as a result of their own
  independent efforts.</p>

  <h4>Fascism in Spain</h4>

  <p>In Spain, fascism took a different route. The revolutionary working class developed
  very rapidly in the 1930s &mdash; threatening not only the monarchy but the capitalist
  system, which was still tied in with all the ancient feudal institutions.</p>

  <p>Spain seemed to be the country par excellence where feudal institutions could exist
  within the womb of capitalist society. It seemed as if the working class was more
  removed from Marxism than in Italy, Germany and elsewhere in Europe. But this theory
  vanished into thin air when the workers' movement went on revolutionary strikes and
  threatened to topple not only the monarchy but the capitalist institutions.</p>

  <p>There is a legend in the U.S. that the whole struggle in Spain was between democracy
  and fascism. That is not true. It was between the revolutionary working class and the
  capitalist class. The bourgeoisie masked itself in a democratic form late in the
  day.</p>

  <p>The existence of an armed and revolutionary working class in Spain compelled the
  ruling class to appeal to the military. Not being able to convince the entire military
  to stage a counter-revolutionary insurrection, they got one of the leading militarists
  &mdash; Francisco Franco &mdash; to lead an open, violent, counter-revolutionary
  assault on the workers' movement in 1936. He openly denounced bourgeois democracy as
  responsible for all the evils in Spain. He got the support of the Catholic
  hierarchy.</p>

  <p>Armed to the teeth, Franco began a bloody extermination of the workers'
  organizations: the communists, socialists and anarchists.</p>

  <p>Fascism was brought about in Spain as retaliation against the workers' movement for
  daring to take destiny in its own hands. Before the workers could succeed, the
  bourgeoisie intervened militarily, with no resistance from England, France and the
  U.S.</p>

  <h4>Why German fascism was so destructive</h4>

  <p>In Germany it was the same, only more dramatic and more destructive.</p>

  <p>The workers' movement in Germany was the strongest and most educated in all the
  world at that time. So many great Marxists had come from there: Marx and Engels,
  Mehring, Kautsky, Liebknecht and others.</p>

  <p>It was the land where socialism seemed to have originated, where the soil seemed
  ready for a takeover by the socialists and communists.</p>

  <p>But that was not to happen, especially given the existence of a world ruling class
  with its eye sharply focused on the situation. Germany was the center of Europe. A
  revolution there would change the basis for capitalist society.</p>

  <p>I am not unmindful of the policy of the Communist Parties in these countries; not
  unmindful of the fear of the Communist Party leadership under Stalin of supporting the
  German revolution; not unmindful of the politics of the Kremlin at the time and how it
  dealt with the various situations. That is a history of the struggle between the policy
  of accommodation and conciliation of the Soviet leadership under Stalin versus the
  revolutionary program of Trotsky.</p>

  <p>In Germany, the bourgeoisie had on its side not only the army and police but outside
  military organizations that they began to build out of fear that they couldn't rely on
  the military. The communists and left socialists in the workers' movement began to
  counter this by building up their own military formations. They all were preparing for
  what was sure to come: a showdown between the two antagonistic classes.</p>

  <p>That is all a matter of documentation. Everyone knew. I remember reading the papers
  every day at the time to find out about the street struggles in Germany between the
  communists and the fascists &mdash; counting how many the workers won and the Nazis
  lost, faithfully hoping that the day of reckoning would come.</p>

  <p>The Social-Democratic Party was numerically the strongest working-class party. Its
  electoral strength was enormous. It had not only won seats in the Reichstag
  (parliament), but had majorities in a number of the smaller cities and strong
  representation in the larger cities. The Nazis aimed their guns at both socialists and
  communists.</p>

  <p>The workers' parties failed to recognize that the hour of the struggle for power was
  coming closer and closer, and that electoral gains or losses would not be decisive. The
  struggle could not be resolved by so-called democratic or constitutional means. Both
  sides of the barricades were being armed: the workers on the one side and the Nazi
  goons supported by the ruling class on the other. The question was which side would be
  ready to strike first.</p>

  <p>Trotsky urged the revolutionary workers to be on guard and prepare for insurrection.
  He also urged the Soviet Union to open up military maneuvers on its Western front and
  to give courage and support to the communists and the workers' movement.</p>

  <p>None of this happened. The Nazis struck first, preparing a frame-up with the
  Reichstag fire. This demoralized the leadership and paralyzed the working class so that
  it could not take up arms.</p>

  <p>There was a complete failure of leadership by the most developed, most serious, most
  loved working-class party at the time. It went down to defeat &mdash; and that changed
  the international situation, leading to a bloody war.</p>

  <p>This is sad, but it is important to bring out the lessons if we are to understand
  what is going on in Russia today. The elections are the smallest part of the whole
  struggle. That's not what is significant. What is going on is a slow, developing
  contest between the working class and the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <h4>Effects of Russian Revolution</h4>

  <p>The great proletarian dictatorship &mdash; which in 1917 had brought to the world a
  living, socialist government where the workers themselves for the first time ruled all
  phases of society &mdash; eroded after a period of time. It did not get the
  international solidarity necessary to support a great revolution.</p>

  <p>By the 1930s, the leadership of the Soviet Union was fearful of intervening in the
  German struggle. Stalin was known to be apprehensive that the European revolution would
  upstage the Soviet leadership. Be that as it may, Hitler's rise to power in Germany
  ended for a long time the era of European revolutions as they had been developing in
  Italy, Spain and Germany.</p>

  <p>But the fires of the Russian Revolution have never been put out. No matter how many
  changes there have been, there is still a spirit of revolutionary struggle. The working
  class there has not been overcome. And what is more, the greatest achievement of the
  workers &mdash; the socialized economy &mdash; has not been fully destroyed. A great
  part remains socialized.</p>

  <p>The Russian bourgeoisie up until now has been unable to either destroy it or manage
  it. Therefore, the country is in a severe economic crisis.</p>

  <p>The crisis in Russia is not the typical raging capitalist crisis of overproduction.
  It comes from the partial breakup of the socialist economy and the new bourgeoisie's
  inability to set itself up as a ruling class with a capitalist economy. Ever since
  Gorbachev began his perestroika, the bourgeois groupings have had a hand in the Russian
  state. But they have been unable to manage the economy or destroy the framework of the
  socialist organization.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie cannot consolidate its rule without converting the economy into
  individual, private ownership &mdash; even in the form of monopoly. It has not been
  able to accomplish this.</p>

  <p>The new bourgeoisie cannot overcome the remnants of socialist organization utilizing
  what is apparently still some form of socialist law. So they go from day to day with
  nothing much happening. And the crisis continues to deteriorate.</p>

  <p>It is under these circumstances that a new form of rule is emerging over Russia, a
  capitalist dictatorship that is fascist in form.</p>

  <h4>Zhirinovsky and the capitalist economic reforms</h4>

  <p>Now, why is this fascist leader Zhirinovsky against the so-called reforms aimed at
  establishing capitalism?</p>

  <p>First, is he really against them? He knows the workers are against the bourgeois
  reforms so he says he is against them. I doubt very much that he is.</p>

  <p>Second, the socialized economy as it still exists is not incompatible with a fascist
  state according to their theory. In fact, that is what Mussolini and Hitler wanted but
  were unable to get: a corporate state fully integrated with the economy. But whether
  the state-owned industry can actually be incorporated into a fascist state is something
  for the future. For the time being, we should take it as demagogy and not something
  that is a genuine part of his fascist ideology.</p>

  <p>Here you have a new bourgeoisie &mdash; not fully formed, still existing alongside
  of socialized industry, trying desperately to bring about a capitalist system along the
  lines of Western capitalism and unable to do it. And Western imperialism is so
  avaricious, so aggressive &mdash; moving in with money, with agents, in order to be
  able to control the economy and the politics of the country. All this has raised the
  character of the crisis from stagnation to incredible severity.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances any individual with significant stature can assert himself
  as a leader or savior and try to lead the country in a fascist direction. Someone like
  Zhirinovsky can arise out of the blue because of the economic situation.</p>

  <p>The only solution for the Russian bourgeoisie, under these circumstances, is a
  fascist dictatorship. And a fascist dictatorship is not altogether out of consideration
  by the U.S. The only problem for the U.S. imperialists is if it is done without their
  consent and in apparent opposition to them.</p>

  <p>All the tears they are shedding about democracy are pure hypocrisy. They fear a
  challenge by an invigorated capitalist Russia in Europe.</p>

  <p>Zhirinovsky does not have a strong organized base in the mass movement the way
  Hitler did. He is riding on a wave of discontent. Whether he can organize the
  discontent and turn it into a mass movement is another matter.</p>

  <p>An extremely important point to remember is that the Communist Party-Russian
  Federation, which has a great deal of influence, is not yet oriented in the direction
  of the <em>seizure of power</em> and a violent struggle with the enemy class
  organizations. It seems to be adapting itself to the status-quo situation &mdash; which
  may be ephemeral, and can take a sharp turn to the right and overwhelm working-class
  and progressive organizations altogether. Abiding by the rules of bourgeois democracy
  may be fine if bourgeois democracy is stable, at least for a time, but this cannot be
  said of Russia today.</p>

  <p>The party has to be oriented not to go along as though there will always be a
  constitutional democratic regime, and "we got 13 percent of the vote so we need 51
  percent to become the ruling party." That is a terrible illusion, even in a capitalist
  democracy.</p>

  <p>It has to be oriented in a militant way &mdash; to the seizure of buildings, armed
  forays into capitalist institutions, fraternization with the military, opening up
  military skirmishes here and there. The party takes on the character of a great danger
  to the system and thereby wins the loyalty of the workers. It will of course earn the
  enmity of the international bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>As it is, all the bourgeois parties say they would rather make a united front with
  the communists than the fascists. That is because they see the communists as no danger
  to bourgeois rule. The CP-RF is strictly an opposition party, which is okay in a
  stable, bourgeois regime &mdash; up to a point. A communist party, we have learned on
  the basis of experience ever since the Russian Revolution, has to orient itself to the
  seizure of power &mdash; not by bourgeois democracy, but by the fact of its power.</p>

  <p>The military is like a sociological carbon copy of the rest of society. At the
  present time it hasn't got a unified policy. It doesn't seem to stand for anything. It
  seems to be concerned about when they are going to retire, their benefits, etc.
  However, if a struggle breaks out between the workers and the bourgeoisie, then the
  military or a section of it will wake up. Unless I am gravely misinformed, however, I
  don't see it taking any revolutionary initiative on its own.</p>

  <h4>Which way will Yeltsin go?</h4>

  <p>Yeltsin is cooperating and collaborating with the U.S. But Russia is a great big
  country, with a very rich revolutionary tradition that still lives. And while he is
  accommodating and carrying on with the U.S. like a collaborator, this could change
  rapidly.</p>

  <p>The forces underneath him &mdash; even the bourgeois forces &mdash; can radically
  move away from that kind of collaboration, especially if the crisis continues. And
  Yeltsin could turn out to be the rabble rouser or bully, saying, "Well, I have been
  betrayed by Wall Street," and so on, and move in another corner.</p>

  <p>He is a representative of the Russian bourgeois elements, which are still very
  meager and ill-formed. But he is not the kind of stooge you would find elsewhere. He is
  collaborating, but as you see, the fact that Clinton is coming to Russia for a summit
  meeting in a country that is bankrupt is recognition that it is not just a neocolonial
  country.</p>

  <p>It is inherent in the situation that at any moment Yeltsin, being a demagogue and
  bourgeois politician, could change colors in order to outdo either the revolutionary
  left or the fascist threat that he sees now. At the moment, he is not trying to outdo
  Zhirinovsky. As I see it, he does not consider Zhirinovsky a great threat to his
  authority. In the meantime, Yeltsin has the reins, and he could play the left demagogue
  as well as he played the right one.</p>

  <h4>Crisis of leadership</h4>

  <p>What about the working class?</p>

  <p>It is going through a series of very important crises, including a crisis of
  leadership capable of dealing with the situation both nationally and internationally.
  We know of the existence of communist organizations and their valiant efforts. They are
  growing and gaining experience, and we are all with them. The only criticism would be
  that some are accommodating themselves, in one way or another, to what appears to be a
  bourgeois parliamentary regime in Russia. The bourgeois parliamentary regime in Russia
  is a cover for the development of a fascist dictatorship.</p>

  <p>How long it will take and what kind of road it will take we don't know. The issue,
  as in 1917, is as Lenin posed it: either a fascist dictatorship or a revived
  proletarian dictatorship.</p>

  <p>There are only two fundamental classes in society. A dictatorship of the proletariat
  can go through various stages of modification and loss of revolutionary momentum. But
  the means of production are still fundamentally in the hands of the proletariat.</p>

  <p>It is necessary for the Russian working class to organize itself as a proletarian
  movement. Not with the aim of participating in the present stage of capitalist
  formations and accommodating to their processes &mdash; but more in the nature of being
  a subversive movement against the whole kit and caboodle of the existing organizations,
  and most of all to point up the danger of fascism.</p>

  <p>Certainly a united front is necessary, and it is necessary to cooperate with other
  groups. But the most important thing is to realize that at the present time in Russia
  there is a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>It may take the present form or go to the extreme, as it would with Zhirinovsky, who
  may be transitory. But the situation is fluid. There will be many more crises.</p>

  <p>It helps enormously for the revolutionary vanguard and workers everywhere to educate
  themselves in the course of this crisis, to review the entire history of the
  proletariat in Russia, in Europe and in the United States.</p>

  <p>We hope that in going over and examining the events in Russia, we will fortify the
  movement in the United States and raise the theoretical and practical level of our
  party.</p>
