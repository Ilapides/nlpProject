  <h1>Yeltsin vs. Congress of People's Deputies</h1>

  <h2>What the struggle reveals</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 1, 1993)</h5>

  <p>To understand the struggle between the two tendencies in Russia &mdash; the Congress
  of People's Deputies on one side and Yeltsin and his supporters on the other &mdash; we
  must go beyond the daily charges and counter-charges. We must take time out from the
  noise of battle and ask what the basic issue dividing the two camps is.</p>

  <p>No immediate solution of this issue is in the offing. This will be a protracted
  struggle with a variety of incidents pointing in different directions. We can only
  arrive at an enlightened view of the situation if we view it in a broader, historical
  perspective.</p>

  <p>We have to go beyond the so-called constitutional or parliamentary form of the
  struggle and get to its roots.</p>

  <p>The struggle goes beyond this or that personality, this or that form of government.
  In essence, it emerges as a struggle between diametrically opposed social systems.
  These two social systems historically rest on different classes whose interests are
  diametrically opposed and irreconcilable.</p>

  <p>This may not be immediately evident in Russia, because the form of the struggle
  hides its class essence. Indeed, if we could see only the domestic, Russian supporters
  of the Yeltsin grouping, it might be more difficult to assess the class essence of this
  camp at this time.</p>

  <p>But we also see the entire imperialist camp, with hardly any exceptions, backing
  Yeltsin.</p>

  <p>This makes it abundantly clear that Yeltsin's group rests on the bourgeois elements
  in the USSR. This includes petty proprietors, directors who hope to become owners,
  well-heeled bureaucrats who think they can succeed under either socialism or
  capitalism, elements of the technocracy and all who favor private property.</p>

  <h4>Yeltsin exposed as agent of capital</h4>

  <p>Without question, Yeltsin now stands exposed as a representative of the bourgeoisie
  in the USSR and an agent of big foreign capital.</p>

  <p>But is the Congress of People's Deputies the consistent representative of the
  working class and of the collective peasantry?</p>

  <p>The answer has to be no. But the qualifications to the answer are equally
  significant.</p>

  <p>To understand these qualifications it's helpful to examine the historical evolution
  of each of the universal social systems humanity has witnessed since the early primary
  communist societies.</p>

  <p>It's not unusual for an oppressed class seeking its liberation to gravitate or be
  pulled into the orbit of a grouping with whom they have only a temporary, conjunctural
  interest. They may find themselves fighting under the leadership of this grouping. But
  the salvation of the oppressed class lies in taking an independent direction under its
  own leadership.</p>

  <p>For example, when the 18th century French monarchy was under severe economic and
  financial stress, it had to raise taxes. It was forced to call in the three estates
  &mdash; nobility, clergy and the oppressed but now rising bourgeoisie &mdash; in an
  effort to tax them for financial relief.</p>

  <p>The rising bourgeoisie was the only class with money. In a position of authority, it
  raised its own political demands. These in turn aroused the masses against the old
  order. The king's attempt to bolster his finances turned into a disaster for the
  monarchy.</p>

  <p>What emerged from the convocation of the three estates was not the nobility stripped
  of the monarchy. It was the demolition of the privileges of the nobility, the monarchy
  and the clergy, and the emergence of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>What a lesson. What seemed to be an orderly development instead evoked the greatest
  revolutionary storm of that period.</p>

  <h4>Russian workers seem submerged</h4>

  <p>At the moment the numerically vast and economically and industrially powerful
  Russian working class seems to be submerged almost to the point of non-existence. But
  its great weight is felt as a gravitational pull on the Congress of People's
  Deputies.</p>

  <p>The Congress's contradictory social interests lead it in two directions: on one
  hand, to a serious struggle against Yeltsin and the bourgeois restoration of
  capitalism; on the other, it guards itself against the emergence of the working class
  as a class destined to take over the reins of society. Nevertheless, the proletariat
  finds representation in the Congress of People's Deputies.</p>

  <p>Another historical analogy, this one closer to home, helps illustrate how this can
  occur. What was the class character of the Civil War in the United States? Was it
  merely about states' rights and the sovereignty of the federal government? Was it about
  individual freedom and the rights of states to secede?</p>

  <p>No. It was in essence a struggle between two diametrically opposed social systems,
  each resting on a different form of class exploitation. It was a struggle between the
  Northern capital's exploitation of wage labor as against the outmoded Southern
  slaveocracy's exploitation of chattel slavery.</p>

  <p>Politically the North was on the progressive side. The Northern bourgeoisie was
  progressive as against the Southern slaveowners. The Northern bourgeoisie was
  interested in defeating the South to expand the capitalist system from which it could
  garner fabulous profits.</p>

  <p>To defeat the South, the Northern bourgeoisie had to emancipate the slaves. So it
  appeared in the role of liberator of the Black masses.</p>

  <p>We should recall in this context that bourgeois historians have for the most part
  obliterated the significance of the many, many Black slave rebellions during the entire
  epoch of slavery here and in other countries in this hemisphere such as Brazil, Haiti
  and Cuba. The role of the Black people in the struggle for emancipation is worthy of a
  full discussion requiring more space than this article allows.</p>

  <p>Aside from the political struggles, chattel slavery was doomed to die in the
  struggle against capitalist development. The South could develop a splendid military
  establishment. It could build vast estates and garner huge profits from cotton. But in
  the long run the development of capitalist industry doomed chattel slavery.</p>

  <p>The North could build a transcontinental railroad as it earlier built the Erie
  Canal. Chattel slavery could in no way compete with this. Northern capital could enlist
  virtually all the rich countries from Europe to advance loans to develop capitalism.
  The South could get loans only with difficulty and for purposes of survival.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin displays an overwhelming tendency to fall on all fours to get the support of
  the imperialist bourgeoisie. The Southern slaveocracy had substantially the same
  strategy toward England during the Civil War. England tried to mobilize all Europe to
  aid the South, but the effort collapsed. In the end, there was no way the South could
  win.</p>

  <p>The expansionist power of industrial capital and the superior productivity of wage
  labor over chattel slavery made themselves obvious whenever an industrial project was
  up for consideration. The slaveocracy could not undertake or even participate in the
  exploration of the Northwest.</p>

  <p>The new social system established by the Russian Revolution proved its prowess. The
  new workers' state defeated 14 capitalist countries, which in the few years after 1917
  attempted to strangle the revolution and failed. By virtue of its new social system
  based upon the collective ownership of the means of production, the USSR became, in the
  words of its class enemies, a "superpower."</p>

  <p>It was capable of challenging the mightiest capitalist power.</p>

  <h4>What has the `triumph' of capitalism brought?</h4>

  <p>Let us for the moment, and only for the moment, put aside the cause of the collapse
  of the USSR and ask ourselves what the "triumph" of capitalist restoration has achieved
  in the time since Gorbachev first proposed his "reforms."</p>

  <p>In a period of similar length &mdash; from the end of the civil war between the
  Whites and the Reds to the first Five Year Plan &mdash; the Soviet Union accomplished
  with its planned economy what even the capitalist world regarded as nothing less than a
  miracle.</p>

  <p>The justification for every new social system that overturns the older system is
  that it proves itself economically superior. It raises the productive forces of
  society, and in the narrowest sense the productivity of labor, over that of the
  previous social system. It is capable of producing greater wealth faster than any
  previous social system.</p>

  <p>Nobody put the achievements of capitalism in a better historical perspective than
  Karl Marx himself, writing in 1848 in the <em>Communist Manifesto:</em></p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more
  massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations
  together. Subjection of nature's forces to human, machinery, application of chemistry
  to industry and agriculture, steam navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing
  of whole continents for cultivation, canalization of rivers, whole populations conjured
  out of the ground &mdash; what earlier century had even a presentiment that such
  productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labor?</p>

  <p>The overall struggle &mdash; if we compare each of the universal social systems
  &mdash; hinges on the productivity of labor over a long stretch of history. In modern
  times, in our era, a shorter time period is more appropriate to prove its
  viability.</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that the system of which Gorbachev and Yeltsin are the
  principal representatives has had a sufficient time to prove its viability over
  socialism.</p>

  <h4>Only a difference of pace</h4>

  <p>First let us clearly understand &mdash; in broad strokes &mdash; what the basic
  differences between Gorbachev and Yeltsin were. It is absolutely incontestable that
  some time after Gorbachev took over, both he and Yeltsin came out in support of the
  pro-capitalist reforms. So in fact did the present Congress of People's Deputies.</p>

  <p>It is now incontestable that the reforms were oriented toward bourgeois restoration,
  toward private ownership. After a protracted struggle, the difference between Gorbachev
  and Yeltsin reduced itself to how quickly the reforms should be executed. This too is
  incontestable.</p>

  <p>In the early days these reforms were disguised to appear as a means of democratizing
  or for releasing the individual initiative of the masses. But it became abundantly
  clear, especially after the 19th Party Conference in June 1988, that the Gorbachev
  leadership and later Yeltsin were orienting toward restorating capitalism.</p>

  <p>So the struggle reduced itself to one of slower or faster pace.</p>

  <p>Either under the slower pace of Gorbachev or the faster pace of Yeltsin, what has
  been achieved to demonstrate the superiority of capitalism over socialism? Can either
  Gorbachev or Yeltsin point to a single achievement of economic value to the masses? Can
  they point to any accomplishment?</p>

  <p>Can they even point to a single socialist industrial enterprise which, having been
  privatized, became an economic success?</p>

  <p>In these half dozen or so years, if the bourgeois system was superior, was it not
  possible to have at least one substantial success story?</p>

  <p>In capitalist society, everything is measured by economic success. Marxist criteria
  for judging an economic system focus on how productive it is. These criteria reveal the
  bankruptcy of capitalism.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin and Gorbachev can't show a success over a period that is long enough to
  produce one, even using their own capitalist criteria.</p>

  <p>In the construction of socialism in the USSR the government had to struggle against
  world imperialism. In introducing capitalism, the domestic capitalist forces in Russia
  have not only the encouragement but the direct aid of world imperialism.</p>

  <p>Now another event demonstrates the bankruptcy of attempting to overcome a socialist
  system by reintroducing capitalism. The Yeltsin government, unable to show any success
  through its rapid privatization scheme, needs to suggest that the president of the U.S.
  come to Russia to shore up Yeltsin's fortunes.</p>

  <p>How can such a system succeed? The Russian working class, along with the workers and
  peasants in all the former Soviet republics, is bound to find the road back to
  socialist construction. This road will be a hard one, no doubt.</p>

  <p>But there is no other way out. They will need the help of the world's proletariat
  and all the oppressed peoples of the world.</p>
