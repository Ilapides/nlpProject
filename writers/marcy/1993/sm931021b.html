  <h1>What Workers World said on the Yeltsin-parliament fight</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Oct. 21, 1993)</h5>

  <p><em>Workers World has closely followed the unfolding events in Russia and the former
  Soviet Union. The following are excerpts from writings and statements by WWP
  Chairperson Sam Marcy at key points in the struggle.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Feb. 20, 1992:</strong> "There was no foundation for capitalist democracy in
  the USSR. ... Full-scale bourgeois democracy cannot be artificially created by the
  Harvard whiz kids and errand boys and girls of the Pentagon and Wall Street who are now
  encamped in Moscow.</p>

  <p>"The truth is that the giant oil companies of Western imperialism are ... carefully
  observing the situation, casing the joint, waiting for the appropriate moment.</p>

  <p>"That will not aid the establishment of capitalist democracy but will strengthen
  autocracy, if not fascism itself. ...</p>

  <p>"The imperialists are not out to aid what was the USSR &mdash; they are out to raid
  it. That is why the perspective must be posed correctly: Either it will end up in the
  resuscitation of the workers' state &mdash; a proletarian dictatorship of the Leninist
  type, with socialist democracy &mdash; or the chaos, the disorganization, the
  continuing dismantlement and vandalizing of socialist property will lead to a fascist
  dictatorship.</p>

  <p>"... What remains is for the proletarian vanguard elements ... to organize for the
  struggle."</p>

  <p><strong>Dec. 24, 1992:</strong> "The ... element that is completely indispensable is
  for the Congress of People's Deputies to unequivocally assert that the ownership of the
  basic means of production is completely under the jurisdiction of the Congress and that
  the officials of the government, and in particular the directors of the plants, the
  offices and all the ministries have to be nominated and approved by the Congress.</p>

  <p>" ... the Congress has to reassert its constitutional authority. ... [But] only the
  working class can supply the necessary impetus and momentum for a real change in the
  course of Soviet politics and economics. In a word, it is only the working class and
  its allies that can return Russia and all the former Soviet republics to a course of
  resuming socialist development."</p>

  <p><strong>March 1993:</strong> Yeltsin has "illegally and unconstitutionally suspended
  the Congress in a struggle over the pace of the restoration of capitalism in Russia, in
  particular the dismantling and privatization of state property. ...</p>

  <p>"The crisis is not merely a constitutional one, not just a struggle for power
  between different branches of government. At bottom, it is a class struggle over who
  will own the property built up over years of socialist construction."</p>
