  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Sam Marcy on an execution (April 8, 1993)</title>

  <h1>Sam Marcy on an execution</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 8, 1993)</h5><em>Statement by Sam Marcy, chairperson of Workers
  World Party, to a March 25 meeting in New York's Dominican community protesting the
  execution of Carlos Santana</em>

  <p>The barbarous execution of an innocent man, ordered by a racist court for no other
  reason than his nationality, is a total outrage. The governor of Texas, Anne Richards,
  who poses as a liberal, has proven by her actions that she is a tool of the imperialist
  ruling class, whose record of oppression and exploitation is well known throughout the
  world.</p>

  <p>History will record the execution of Carlos Santana alongside those of other martyrs
  from the ranks of the workers and the oppressed, such as Sacco and Vanzetti, the
  Rosenbergs, Corky Gonzalez and all the other victims of political reaction
  worldwide.</p>

  <p>Workers World Party extends its solidarity to this gathering here tonight in the
  spirit of building a united struggle against racism, capitalism and imperialism.</p>

  <p>Carlos Santana presente!</p>

  <p>Long live the struggle of the workers and the oppressed!</p>
