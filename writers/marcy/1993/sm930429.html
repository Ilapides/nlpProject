  <h1>Wishful thinking and the old colonialism</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 29, 1993)</h5>

  <p>It is often thought that nations are like individuals. Under the impact of momentous
  events they undergo swift changes in mood, which can carry them from the heights of
  optimism down to the depth of the most despondent pessimism.</p>

  <p>But nations are not autonomous, independent entities. They are social structures
  ruled by definite classes.</p>

  <p>No nation, whether oppressed or oppressing, is ruled or governed without a class
  structure &mdash; a leadership that answers to the class in power but speaks in the
  name of the whole nation.</p>

  <p>Epochal revolutionary developments like the October socialist revolution in Russia
  or the Chinese socialist revolution throw the imperialist bourgeoisie into a tizzy. And
  its ideologues invariably reflect the mood of the ruling class, often in great literary
  strokes.</p>

  <p>Thus Oswald Spengler wrote <em>The Decline of the West</em> in the 1920s. It was
  largely a lament over the rising proletariat and the socialist revolution in
  particular.</p>

  <p>Spengler represented the pessimism of the ruling class, particularly in Europe. The
  victory of the October socialist revolution in Russia, the growing revolutionary crisis
  in Germany, and the generally sad state of European capitalism were soon to be greatly
  magnified by the worldwide collapse of the economic system, led by the Wall Street
  crash of 1929.</p>

  <p>A more extensive and learned form of the same phenomenon is contained in Arnold
  Toynbee's <em>A Study of History</em> &mdash; a massive exposition on the decline and
  fall of what he refers to as many civilizations. It conveyed a mood of pessimism for
  which he blamed the Cold War.</p>

  <p>But in reality his disappointment reflected the rising insurgency of the Western
  proletariat &mdash; including the coming to power of the Labour Party in Britain
  &mdash; immediately after the Second World War.</p>

  <p>There have been innumerable examples of optimism or pessimism playing a great role
  in connection with the objectives of this or that ruling class.</p>

  <p>Pessimism, however, can never be an instrument for class liberation of the workers,
  even though the ability to describe with talent and foresight the sordid character of
  capitalist exploitation and imperialist oppression is an instrument of class
  deliverance. Revolutionary optimism is congenital to the proletarian movement, which
  doesn't have the luxury of an extensive outpouring of pessimism that only facilitates
  the ruling class attack.</p>

  <h4>Eulogy to colonialism</h4>

  <p>We are reminded of all this by an utterly incredible article in the April 18 (1993)
  New York Times Magazine of April 18 with the startling title: "Colonialism's Back
  &mdash; and Not a Moment Too Soon." In case this might be regarded as facetious, the
  secondary head made it clear: "Let's face it: Some countries are just not fit to govern
  themselves."</p>

  <p>It was written by Paul Johnson, who is described as the author of <em>Modern
  Times</em> &mdash; who ever heard of that? &mdash; and is "at work on a history of the
  American people."</p>

  <p>We wonder whether the Johannesburg Post would care to publish such an article at
  this time. We surmise that the publishers would shake in their boots at the very
  thought of putting something like that in print at a time when the South African
  working class has achieved, in depth and in numbers, a virtually unprecedented level of
  proletarian activity. So far, no amount of terror has been able to subdue them. Nor do
  we hear of the ruling cliques, from Pretoria to Johannesburg to Cape Town, exuding any
  of the confidence displayed in this utterly incredible article in the New York
  Times.</p>

  <p>Evidently his article was written before the magnificent general strike that took
  place after the assassination of South African Communist leader Chris Hani. However,
  the Times must have thought his article was still valid in light of the Pentagon's
  recent victories in Somalia.</p>

  <p>We cannot but conclude that Johnson's paean to colonialism is representative of the
  mood of at least a section of the ruling class, if not the orientation of contemporary
  imperialism in general.</p>

  <p>This article concludes that people in the former colonies are clamoring for Western
  intervention, and that "the civilized world has a mission to go out to these desperate
  places and govern." By "civilized world," Johnson writes he means first and foremost
  the United States, Britain and France, but also their opponents in the last world war
  &mdash; Germany and Japan.</p>

  <p>In return, says Johnson, they will earn "the unspoken gratitude of millions of
  misgoverned or ungoverned people who will find in this altruistic revival of
  colonialism the only way out of their present intractable miseries."</p>

  <h4>Where does their optimism come from?</h4>

  <p>Where does this extraordinary optimism of the imperialists over their role in
  history come from? Of course, it is easy for ruling class servants to exude confidence
  and optimism, even when there is no basis for it. They are simply doing a job.</p>

  <p>However, an objective basis for their optimism does exist, although it does not
  exactly confirm the author's viewpoint. It is the collapse of the USSR.</p>

  <p>When the USSR was a formidable world power and one of the five permanent members on
  the UN Security Council, it was unthinkable for the imperialists to openly praise
  colonialism. Nor could they use the UN as a cover for military intervention in the
  oppressed countries. (The U.S. got UN endorsement of the Korean War in 1950 only
  because the USSR had walked out of the Security Council.)</p>

  <p>However, the disintegration of the USSR is not all that is happening in the world.
  Nor has the last word been said.</p>

  <p>The anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist movement is experiencing a resurgence in many
  places, particularly in South Africa. And, as in the last great upsurge of the
  oppressed peoples after World War II, they are looking to genuine communist leadership
  to stand up to the imperialists.</p>

  <p>Red-baiting may work in Washington, but it doesn't in Johannesburg.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the ruling classes are in a downhill slide with a worldwide
  capitalist recession. A dozen years ago, they could point to Japan as an exception to
  capitalist crisis. Now they are unable to do even that.</p>

  <p>In his article, Johnson waxes lyrical on the "high standards" set by the British and
  French colonialists in Africa. He praises their skill and efficiency in building "a
  superb infrastructure of roads and ports." Yes, the very things needed to extract the
  riches of the continent as quickly as possible. How in the world can he write such
  drivel in the face of the universal hatred of the colonial rulers in all their former
  and present territories, from India to Africa to northern Ireland, where the longest
  continuing rebellion against colonialism continues unabated?</p>

  <p>Britain, it should be said, is a country in debt to U.S. imperialism. Without that
  prop, it wouldn't be able to stand on its own feet. But the U.S. itself is the biggest
  debtor country in the world. Without the prop of super-exploitation in all of Latin
  America, the South Pacific and the Middle East, U.S. imperialism wouldn't survive.</p>

  <h4>Setting up colonial governments</h4>

  <p>Colonialism involves not only economic super-exploitation but openly setting up a
  governmental administration. The small country of Somalia was brought to utter ruin and
  then invaded under this very pretext of restoring a government &mdash; which Johnson
  praises because "some states are not yet fit to govern themselves."</p>

  <p>But the truth is that the search for oil constituted the objective basis for the
  imperialist invasion. Whether they'll find it in quantity and quality is another
  matter. That is the objective.</p>

  <p>Still it has nothing to do with the governance of the Somalis, who ran their own
  society for centuries.</p>

  <p>In the longer view of history, the destruction of this country may be only a
  temporary setback in the overall struggle of the working class together with all the
  anti-imperialist forces against the tiny minority of exploiters and oppressors who run
  the world.</p>

  <p>After all, Rome was seemingly all-powerful, but how many times was it sacked in
  ancient times? In the end, no matter how many volumes could be written on "the grandeur
  that was Rome,'' it disintegrated because it was based on slavery.</p>

  <p>How really lasting can the occupation of Somalia be in the face of the availability
  of modern weapons of education as well as destruction?</p>

  <h4>Rebellions in the U.S.</h4>

  <p>Inside the U.S., many rebellions have been suppressed, in Watts, Newark, Detroit,
  Harlem, and most recently Los Angeles. This gave the ruling class temporary relief.</p>

  <p>But the ruling class was unable to solve any of the problems that confront the
  ever-increasing number of the oppressed people. Since last year's rebellion in Los
  Angeles, even the bourgeois press has to admit that not one problem has been solved.
  How can that be a basis for optimism?</p>

  <p>The rebellions have been spontaneous. And while they result in huge human loss and
  the destruction of property, it is also incontestable that all the legislative
  concessions made over the years have been byproducts of these struggles.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie tries to negate their significance. But scarcely any progress would
  have been made without the intervention of the masses on a huge and violent scale.</p>

  <p>One must take into account not only what happens in the immediate aftermath of the
  rebellions. In the broader perspective of the struggle as a whole, these rebellions
  have been the backbone.</p>

  <p>And what are they but rebellions of an internal colony of U.S. imperialism? How
  different are they from anti-colonial rebellions, except in form? As Marxists, we know
  that it's the essence that lies behi</p>

  <p>nd the form that is significant.</p>

  <p>The Reagan-Bush years marked a massive attack on the living standards of the masses,
  Black and white. But most remarkable has been the devastation to Black America. <em>The
  State of Black America,</em> a series of highly detailed annual reports put out by the
  Urban League, presents reliable statistics on how both relative and absolute poverty
  have increased in the Black communities. The only period of slight improvement was in
  the early 1970s, after the last great round of rebellions.</p>

  <p>The rebellion in Los Angeles, while triggered by the decision in the Rodney King
  beating, was a response to these conditions. The rebellion raised the level of the
  struggle and showed that the deterioration of capitalism is not bringing back
  colonialism &mdash; it is bringing insurrection.</p>

  <p>This great struggle also lays the basis for unity between Black and white workers
  against their common enemy. As Marx said, "Labor with a white skin cannot be free while
  labor with a Black skin is branded."</p>
