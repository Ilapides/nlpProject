  <h1>Russia crisis: The Missouri Compromise revisited</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 8, 1993)</h5>

  <p>Shortly after Boris Yeltsin and his group formally dissolved the USSR in December
  1991, CIA Director Robert Gates announced with great enthusiasm that communism and the
  Soviet Union were dead. Now, some 15 months later and in a less enthusiastic mood,
  Gates says that the U.S. influence in the former USSR is "marginal."</p>

  <p>While the second statement does not exactly contradict the first, it nevertheless
  throws an important light on the direction in which events are moving. What prompted
  Gates' shift to explain U.S. interests as marginal are undoubtedly the growing attacks
  in Russia on Yeltsin's reactionary reforms, as well as on foreign interests that
  support Yeltsin and his cabal.</p>

  <p>There is no question that immediately after the dissolution of the USSR and
  Yeltsin's initiation of his capitalist reforms, there was a growing belief, at least in
  the West, that the masses had lost interest in socialism and were putting their faith
  in Yeltsin and his counter-revolutionary group.</p>

  <p>But 15 months is a long time when inflation is growing by leaps and bounds, when
  production continues to drop at a faster and faster rate (the State Statistics
  Committee now reports a 20 percent decline in the first three months of 1993 compared
  to last year), and when fears of further deterioration in the living standards continue
  unabated. That is why such old hands of the imperialist establishment as Richard Nixon
  have had to join the Clinton administration in promoting a campaign for the U.S.
  government to allocate more and more funds to Yeltsin, in the form of either loans or
  credits. More and more pronouncements are made urging the imperialist allies to produce
  not just programs but more finances.</p>

  <p>Just in case this campaign might lag, someone has come forward who had stood on the
  sidelines: James Baker III, who served as secretary of state during the Reagan and Bush
  administrations. Baker has made an urgent plea in Newsweek magazine (dated April 5) in
  what seems like an answer to Gates. "Some in the West," he says, "argue for a
  wait-and-see policy. These advocates of inaction contend that all the Western
  democracies can do is wait out the political storm in Moscow. I believe such an
  approach would be both dangerous and naive. It is dangerous because the stakes are
  critical to Western [imperialist &mdash; S.M.] interests. It is naive because while
  Western influence may be marginal . . . the outcome may be determined precisely by what
  happens at the margin."</p>

  <p>With respect to Yeltsin, Baker said, "He is well known to be an instinctive and some
  say an impulsive politician." That happens to be true. "And some critics question his
  commitment to democracy. But in my many meetings with him," says Baker, "I've seen his
  instincts at work time and time again and they have always moved toward democratic
  practices, toward free markets and above all toward cooperation with the West."</p>

  <p>It would be wrong to assume that there is an actual split among the U.S.
  imperialists on their attitude toward the struggle in the former USSR. But it is
  important to notice that the re-emergence of the struggle there is significant enough,
  even at this early stage, to have caused dissension within the ruling establishment as
  represented by the former CIA director and the former secretary of state.</p>

  <h4>Essence of the struggle</h4>

  <p>The progressive, anti-imperialist and working class movement needs to focus not only
  on the internal struggle in the former USSR, which of course is fundamental, but also
  must take into account the external pressure from the imperialist colossus. One can
  only wonder what feverish hands were working in the U.S. to produce this monstrosity
  called a compromise between the Yeltsin forces and the Congress.</p>

  <p>We know of at least four ways in which the U.S. government openly intervened to
  force a capitulation. First, Clinton's press secretary, George Stephanopoulos, made a
  statement within hours of Yeltsin's first decrees in which he said the U.S. government
  unequivocally supported Yeltsin. Then Bill Bradley and Richard Lugar, speaking for the
  Democrats and Republicans in the Congress, appeared on TV to endorse this position.
  They then got Britain, France, Germany and other imperialists to throw in their weight.
  And finally, Secretary of State Warren Christopher went before the Council on Foreign
  Relations with a hard-line speech threatening the return of the Cold War if the
  Congress tried to impeach Yeltsin or cut his powers.</p>

  <p>It is absolutely indispensable to keep in mind the fundamental class forces involved
  in the struggle and not to give undue weight to this or that incident, thereby losing
  the threads to the main contenders in the arena. The form of the struggle is one thing,
  its essence is another.</p>

  <p>Basically, it is a struggle between the working class, the collective peasantry, the
  urban and village poor, as against the urban bourgeoisie. But where is the working
  class? Why does it not speak in its name? Who in the Congress speaks for the
  workers?</p>

  <p>The social composition of the Congress at the present time consists of a small
  number who openly speak in the name of communism. The rest to one degree or another are
  former communists, at least in name. They differ from the workers on the basis of their
  social standing. They are a privileged stratum in the population with emoluments that
  distinguish them socially from the workers. These privileges and emoluments, perhaps
  even their lives, would be endangered if the Yeltsin counter-revolution completely
  triumphed. Privatization on the scale that Yeltsin calls for means their virtual
  destruction.</p>

  <p>Yet the difference between their social position and that of the workers is the
  basis for their conciliatory tendency to Yeltsin. This is the material force that lies
  behind the continued groping toward compromise. If the situation in the country were
  such that economic stability could be attained on the present level, such wheeling and
  dealing and compromising could go on forever.</p>

  <p>But the economic debacle that has followed the dismantling of socialist construction
  without the ability to carry through capitalism raises the fundamental problem: Which
  side will win out? It is this that will ultimately sweep the ground out from under the
  feet of the compromisers.</p>

  <h4>Compromise in U.S. history</h4>

  <p>We are again obliged to invoke an analogy from U.S. history &mdash; the struggle
  between the North and the South. Going back as far as 1819 and all the way up to 1850,
  there were continual compromises made between the two social systems &mdash; chattel
  slavery and capitalism. Henry Clay (1777-1852) was the speaker of the House of
  Representatives, similar in position to the head of Russia's Congress, Ruslan
  Khasbulatov. Clay became known as the Great Compromiser after he reached an agreement
  with the vice president, John C. Calhoun (1782-1850). Under the Missouri Compromise,
  Missouri entered the Union as a slave state and Maine as a free state.</p>

  <p>For a while, the compromise worked. But the headlong sweep of industrialization made
  it impossible for the South to stay in the Union &mdash; not because this or that
  compromise was insufficient, but because the ground was being pulled from under the
  system of chattel slavery, as against the Northern wage-slave system.</p>

  <p>Over the long run, chattel slavery was uneconomical as against wage slavery, with
  its much higher productivity based on "free" labor. The wage workers could be "freed"
  from their jobs and homes as the labor market demanded. The employers were freed from
  any responsibility to them, especially as cheap labor flooded in with each new wave of
  immigration.</p>

  <p>Khasbulatov has tried to compromise by agreeing to some of what Yeltsin wanted, such
  as a vote of confidence and a referendum on a new bicameral system of parliamentary
  rule.</p>

  <p>This compromise calls for a referendum, which supposedly is a democratic measure. In
  reality, it can turn out to be the very opposite. It depends on time and circumstance.
  Who will conduct the referendum? Who commands the police and the military? Who controls
  the media? Who enjoys an endless source of bribery and corruption from foreign sources?
  Who could create pogroms? In a word, who is really in authority at the time of the
  referendum?</p>

  <p>Yeltsin has just issued decrees doubling the minimum wage and creating other
  benefits for workers. How will the Congress handle this unrestrained demagogy?</p>

  <p>The question of elections is not what is uppermost in the minds of the people
  &mdash; it's the return to the worst evils of capitalist exploitation. But the way this
  is formulated by the Congress, which has called for a referendum on the "economic and
  social policies of Yeltsin," is so vague that it cannot excite revolutionary passion or
  even understanding.</p>

  <h4>A coalition government?</h4>

  <p>The worst aspect of the dealings between the Congress leaders and Yeltsin is the
  formers' call for a government of national reconciliation &mdash; a fanciful way of
  calling for a coalition government with Yeltsin. What could this possibly achieve? The
  greatest danger at the moment is the Congress leaders' policy of restraining the masses
  from taking the road of struggle in the streets.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter is that they are fearful of the masses. They hope that
  Yeltsin will be able to obtain some sort of a deal with Clinton at the Vancouver
  summit. This may sound paradoxical in light of the entire course of the parliamentary
  struggle they are carrying on, but their fear of the masses is what motivates them to
  this contradictory line. They are pushed in that direction by their material
  interests.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, they have nothing to offer the masses and have adjourned for the
  time being in a moment of crisis. Since we referred to the Civil War in the U.S., let's
  invoke Lincoln's famous words: "When the people tire of their government, they have a
  right to change it. And failing this, they have a revolutionary right to overthrow
  it."</p>
