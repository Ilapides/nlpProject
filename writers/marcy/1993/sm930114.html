  <h1>Clinton and the arrogance of the Fortune 500</h1>

  <h2>Role of competition and monopoly</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Jan. 14, 1993)</h5>

  <p>Beginning with day one of the election campaign &mdash; which now seems ages ago &mdash; and all
  through the long tortuous process up to this very day, one dominant theme has run
  through all the speeches, all the position papers, all the promises. It can be summed
  up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.</p>

  <p>Promises of jobs were made by all the politicians &mdash; Bush, Perot, and of course the
  Clinton-Gore team. There is no question that this was the principal issue in the
  campaign and attracted the most earnest attention.</p>

  <p>All the messages from the politicians and print and electronic media were directed
  to the mass of the population &mdash; the workers, the unemployed and the middle class. The
  message consisted of assurances that the issue of jobs would be taken care of. Each
  political grouping, each candidate had his own approach. Yet if we examine all this
  more closely, we note that one aspect was never referred to by either the Bush
  administration or by president-elect Clinton. And with only two weeks left before the
  inauguration, it still is overlooked as though it does not exist.</p>

  <h4>Talking to the wrong people</h4>

  <p>These politicians have been preaching only to the masses who are already convinced
  they need jobs. They have made no approach, direct or indirect, to those with authority
  over the jobs question. And who are they? They are the giant Fortune 500 corporations
  that control the basic arteries of the economy.</p>

  <p>No direct approach has been made to them. And yet they hold all the levers of
  economic authority.</p>

  <p>Let us take one example which literally stares in the face of hundreds of thousands
  and could affect millions of jobs. Let us consider IBM.</p>

  <p>Have they heard about the message to save jobs? They have proceeded as though this
  does not concern them whatsoever. They have laid off tens of thousands of workers and
  plan to eliminate the jobs of thousands more.</p>

  <p>The question is: Has Clinton talked to them? Has he raised the issue to them?</p>

  <p>Thousands of workers are directly and immediately concerned and have been asking
  themselves: "Why hasn't he said something to them?"</p>

  <p>The layoff of 40,000 or so workers from IBM alone last summer may not seem so much
  in light of the millions of unemployed. But what is often not considered when these
  layoffs are mentioned is the so-called ripple effect. It often leads to four or five
  times as many jobs lost.</p>

  <p>But IBM is not alone. The same cruel practice has been employed by General Motors as
  well. The number of GM workers who have lost their jobs is roughly equivalent to IBM.
  Furthermore, GM has also acted as though all this talk about saving jobs does not
  concern it.</p>

  <p>None of the giant corporations has paid the slightest attention to the flood of
  daily promises on saving jobs, made more imperative by the continuing process of
  so-called restructuring. A so-called auto summit meeting of the three big U.S.
  automakers, along with UAW President Owen Bieber, with a broad agenda, does not
  specifically include discussion of layoffs and recalls.</p>

  <p>Is it because they don't understand that all these promises about creating jobs,
  halting the layoffs or beginning the recalls requires the collaboration of those who
  control the arteries of economic life in the U.S., the Fortune 500? Otherwise, how is
  the process of re-employment ever to begin?</p>

  <p>Almost every day since the election, Clinton and his horde of advisers, many of them
  economists, have been on television making statements of one sort or another about
  their grand plans for the economy. Yet neither these advisers nor Clinton himself have
  thought it necessary to <strong>publicly</strong> warn the giant monopoly corporations
  to halt the process of layoffs.</p>

  <p>Why hasn't Clinton said something to them? Of course, the unemployed workers may
  have welcomed the message of job creation, recalls and the halting of layoffs, but
  isn't this really directed at the wrong people? Shouldn't these issues be raised
  directly with those who really wield the power? Yet this has been avoided.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the union movement, of the mass organizations of women, of Black,
  Latin, Asian and Native people, of lesbians and gays, of the thousands of progressive
  organizations of all kinds need to raise this issue directly or it will be lost.</p>

  <h4>Where does the buck stop?</h4>

  <p>It's been almost two years since a small company, Tastee Bread, threatened to close
  its plant in Queens, N.Y. The workers and the people in the neighborhood, failing to
  get any satisfactory reply from the company, appealed to the mayor of New York City.
  The mayor in turn said he had no power over the company, that it was perhaps a matter
  for the governor. The governor passed this on to the federal government.</p>

  <p>We are now at the stage where a similar process has been followed after literally
  hundreds of small plants closed, where local and state authorities have passed the buck
  to the federal government because it is the repository of political power in the United
  States.</p>

  <p>How must this issue be addressed? By the president-elect himself.</p>

  <p>It must be raised that the Fortune 500 &mdash; the engine of the capitalist system, the
  basic core of the capitalist industrial and technological establishment &mdash; need to be
  directly spoken to, especially since they pretend &mdash; as do IBM, General Motors, General
  Electric and dozens of others &mdash; that they are not relevant to the issue of jobs.</p>

  <p>There are two ways for the president-elect to proceed. One is to raise the issue to
  them informally. It could have been taken up at a secret Blair House meeting of Clinton
  and his principal economic advisers described recently by Time magazine (Jan. 4). "In
  the early evening of December 7, a small group of economic advisers met secretly with
  Bill Clinton at Blair House in Washington," says the magazine. "Their message was
  depressing: the long-term outlook for the nation's economy is worse than the public
  appreciates."</p>

  <p>If this is so, then all the more was it imperative to publicly call this to the
  attention of the leaders of the capitalist economic establishment, the Fortune 500
  giant corporations. But obviously nothing has come of it.</p>

  <h4>Kennedy and Big Steel</h4>

  <p>There is, however, a precedent available to Clinton from previous administrations,
  particularly the Kennedy administration. At that time, the issue was voluntary price
  controls, especially by big business. The U.S. Steel corporation, headed at that time
  by Roger Blough, unilaterally decided not to abide by these so-called voluntary price
  controls. When called to the White House for a meeting with Kennedy and Arthur
  Goldberg, then Secretary of Labor, Blough arrogantly brought with him a press release
  outlining his company's refusal to go along with price controls.</p>

  <p>Kennedy was incensed, and gave Blough a dressing down himself. Of course, Kennedy
  was a member of the ruling class in his own right, since he came from an extremely
  wealthy family. He was especially sensitive to such insubordination.</p>

  <p>It was not that U.S. Steel or the Kennedy administration were so deeply concerned
  about the voluntary price controls, since they were about to be lifted anyway. It was
  the arrogance of the corporation. Kennedy finally forced the steel magnate to come to
  the White House after he had proceeded as though it didn't exist.</p>

  <p>Of course, Clinton is not yet in office. But enough time has passed since the
  election for him to get the lay of the land. It is impossible that the leaders of the
  giant industrial and technological apparatus of the U.S. are unaware that the issue
  foremost in the minds of the general public right now is jobs.</p>

  <p>Under these conditions, Clinton could, without going beyond the scope of any
  capitalist president of the U.S., take measures to bring this crucial issue to the
  forefront and show the responsibility of the Fortune 500 in the ugly phenomenon of
  continuing unemployment, plant closings and layoffs.</p>

  <p>There is an appropriate strategy available to Clinton that does not by any means go
  beyond the constitutional limits of the president. He could issue an executive order
  directed to the entire Fortune 500 industrial-technological apparatus of the U.S. It
  could tell them that 1) they are ordered to cease and desist from any further layoffs;
  2) that they must present a plan for the recall of laid-off employees, and 3) that the
  Clinton administration will invoke its authority to call a special session of Congress
  with an agenda exclusively confined to one item: how to absorb the unemployed back into
  industry and make the necessary appropriations for such an endeavor.</p>

  <p>This is the minimum possible for an administration that genuinely seeks to address
  the very acute problems created by the capitalist economic crisis.</p>

  <p>It would be foolhardy for the progressive labor movement as well as the many
  organizations of Black, Latino, Native, and Asian people, of women, of lesbians and
  gays, to rely on the Clinton administration alone to carry out such measures. This
  program, modest and minimal though it is, must have the backing of the millions upon
  millions of workers and oppressed masses throughout the country.</p>

  <h4>How to reverse downsizing</h4>

  <p>There has been a historic tendency on the part of the capitalist establishment to
  downsize the industrial and technological apparatus. This tendency has been remorseless
  and relentless and continues unabated to this very day. It operates on the assumption
  that profits come before people. Each of the industrial and technological monopolies,
  particularly the giant ones, employ hordes of advisers on how to accelerate this
  inhuman process without any letup.</p>

  <p>The urgent task facing the people, and the working class in particular, is to
  reverse this insidious process by insisting on a reabsorption of the millions of
  unemployed. The heads of the capitalist establishment must get the message that what
  they must do is not continue the downsizing of establishments but reabsorb the
  unemployed work force.</p>

  <p>Science and technology must be used to produce rather than be instruments for
  garnering lucrative profits at the expense of the destruction of productive facilities.
  Some of these may not be profitable, but can be highly useful from the point of view of
  human needs. This is the message that must be brought out loud and clear.</p>

  <p>It must be made clear that technology, which is developing at an especially rapid
  pace, must be an instrument to respond to human needs and not to the inhuman,
  insatiable lust for profit of the few at the expense of the millions.</p>

  <h4>Corporate execs being pounded</h4>

  <p>Of late, particularly since the crisis at GM, IBM and dozens of other giant
  corporations, it has become the fashion for literally hordes of economic advisers,
  consultants, and insider analysts of all sorts and shades to goad the heads of the
  large corporations into accelerating the process of restructuring. Quite a number have
  gone to all lengths attacking the chief executives and chairmen of the boards in
  language which would astonish a reader of 20 or 30 years ago, when these giant
  corporations were enjoying lush profits with a minimum of technological or labor
  problems.</p>

  <p>But now it is commonplace to attack the heads of General Motors and ask why they
  should not be removed. It happened in April when GM removed Robert Stempel as chairman
  of the executive committee and replaced Lloyd Reuss, Stempel's number two man, as
  president. An article in Fortune magazine in July 1992 asked: "Could IBM be ripe for a
  similar shakeup? ... The conditions are there for it happening, absolutely."</p>

  <p>What is the meaning of all this? According to Kim Clark, a Harvard Business School
  professor, "What you have here are two companies [GM and IBM] that at one point
  dominated their industries by producing very large products &mdash; mainframe computers and
  big cars &mdash; and they created organizations that were good at doing that. Then the world
  changed."</p>

  <p>"The similarities between the giants are striking," says Noel Pichy, a professor at
  the University of Michigan business school. "GM and IBM are both number-one companies
  whose inward-looking culture keeps them from waking up on time."</p>

  <p>Like trained animals, this horde of experts knows when to keep silent and when to
  start barking at their masters. Why are they barking so loud now, sometimes calling for
  the resignation of the top executives? It is to force them to accelerate the process of
  downsizing and dismantling the plants and equipment in the interest of super-profits.
  The attacks are not directed at the capitalist corporations themselves, but only at the
  executives. The objective is to goad them into the unsavory business of cutting loose
  not only the ordinary workers but also managers, all in the name of strengthening the
  profit motive, the bottom line.</p>

  <p>This ilk is not attacking the capitalist system. Their function is similar to that
  of scabherding and strikebreaking consulting companies. Only the job varies, not the
  objective.</p>

  <p>And what is their so-called analysis? As Pichy puts it, GM and IBM have an
  "inward-looking culture." So there you have it. This is the problem. Would the problem
  be different if the culture were outward-looking?</p>

  <h4>Capitalist competition and capitalist monopoly</h4>

  <p>What they seem to close their eyes to is that both corporations, not to speak of
  dozens of others, got to the top of the heap due to the very process they are
  continually urging on management &mdash; that is, more and more cutthroat capitalist
  competition. They eliminated so many rivals that capitalist competition went through a
  quantitative growth as a social process and turned into a new quality, monopoly.</p>

  <p>It has nothing to do with culture, inward-looking or outward-looking. The pursuit of
  capitalist competition ultimately results in the destruction of some of the rivals and
  the establishment of a monopoly. Capitalist monopoly, in its turn, begins to evince a
  familiar disease &mdash; hardening of the arteries. It is a sociological process, the result
  of the driving forces of capitalist competition and its inevitable tendency toward
  conversion into capitalist monopoly.</p>

  <p>Monopoly does not abolish competition. Capitalist competition continues on a higher
  plane and exists side by side with capitalist monopoly. This is the problem.</p>

  <p>The productive forces engendered by the capitalist mode of production have grown so
  large, for instance in auto and in such high-tech fields as IBM, that they have
  outgrown the confines of private property. The answer, according to these experts, is
  to break them up, downsize them. For instance, IBM's method is to break up its
  organization into 13 competing units. This is a reactionary process because its sole
  purpose is to downsize in the interest of profit.</p>

  <p>What is needed, however, is not a sledgehammer to break down what has been built up
  via the competitiveness of private property, but the conversion of private property
  into socialized property, to go from competition and monopoly to socialist cooperation.
  This is the only alternative. Using a sledgehammer in the conditions of such high
  technology is pure and simple vandalism. It is also costly, not only in terms of the
  productive forces but more so in human life, as we are seeing.</p>

  <p>The only process that can reverse the downsizing is the socialization of the means
  of production and the recognition that the primary reason for developing the means of
  production is for human need and not for profit.</p>
