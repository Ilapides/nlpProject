  <h1>The war at home and abroad</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Jan. 28, 1993)</h5>

  <p>Every incoming U.S. administration faces the problem of the relation between
  domestic and foreign policy.</p>

  <p>The capitalist media foster the impression that there is an inherent separation
  between an administration's foreign and domestic policy. But invariably, the ruling
  class reveals certain preferences with respect to the allocation of funds and resources
  in one or another direction. The conduct of an administration in foreign affairs and
  military expansion reveals its proclivities in the struggle at home.</p>

  <p>The peace-loving masses, on the other hand, are opposed to war as a solution for
  political and diplomatic problems. They think the government should concentrate on
  uplifting the standard of living &mdash; a fair and reasonable stance.</p>

  <p>The relation between domestic and foreign policy and the pursuit of peaceful
  solutions instead of war have always been proper domains for democratic discussion. Or
  at least that's the way it should be &mdash; if we could ignore the factor of class war
  and the element of class exploitation.</p>

  <h4>Clausewitz' military theories</h4>

  <p>The questions of war and peace have occupied the attention not only of politicians
  but of military leaders. A considerable number have concocted military theories
  regarding the prosecution of war and the imposition of peace. One of the most important
  writers on military strategy &mdash; whose theories have had wide influence in both the
  19th and 20th centuries &mdash; was Karl von Clausewitz (1780-1831).</p>

  <p>Clausewitz was not an armchair general. He participated in military campaigns
  against the French revolutionary army, and spent many years on garrison duty. That
  enabled him to devote a large amount of time to educating himself.</p>

  <p>Like other Germans, Clausewitz entered the Russian service on the eve of Napoleon's
  invasion of Russia. He distinguished himself there and subsequently became a general in
  the Prussian army, where he was appointed head of the war college.</p>

  <p>He used much of his time to study military strategy and write his famous work <em>On
  War.</em> This book was subsequently translated into many languages.</p>

  <p>Clausewitz attracted the attention of not only Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, but
  also later of V.I. Lenin, who studied his work while in Switzerland during the first
  imperialist world war. In Lenin's writings against the imperialist war, he frequently
  quoted Clausewitz. In particular, he repeated Clausewitz' famous generalization: "War
  is nothing but a continuation of political intercourse with the admixture of different
  means."</p>

  <p>Lenin often abbreviated the sentence to read: "War is nothing but a continuation of
  politics by other means."</p>

  <h4>Economics drives politics</h4>

  <p>What is politics? It is concentrated economics.</p>

  <p>Any country's economy is in the hands of the class that owns the means of
  production. The ownership of the means of production determines a ruling class's
  politics and its relation to the oppressed class.</p>

  <p>It is impossible for a ruling class to conduct a war abroad without also conducting
  a war at home. If politics is the concentrated essence of economics and the economy is
  in the hands of a specific ruling class, the war the ruling class is conducting abroad
  is merely a continuation of the war it is conducting at home.</p>

  <p>This is what we have to learn once again relative to the incoming Clinton
  administration.</p>

  <h4>Now they're Clinton's wars</h4>

  <p>Clinton is already involved in conducting wars against Somalia, Yugoslavia and the
  Haitian people. He participated in the decision to send a flotilla of warships to block
  Haitian refugees from coming to the U.S. after he had encouraged them to do so and
  promised them justice. Above all, Clinton is now conducting the war against Iraq.</p>

  <p>The wars being conducted abroad by the Clinton administration and the ruling class
  that Clinton now heads politically are an extension of the domestic policies pursued at
  home &mdash; what Clausewitz called "a continuation" of what is being done so cruelly
  at home.</p>

  <p>The war at home takes the form of a massive assault on the living standards of the
  masses by means of a vast and complex restructuring of capitalist industry. It has
  mercilessly and ruthlessly thrown out millions of workers over the years &mdash; and
  continues to do so at a more rapid rate than ever.</p>

  <p>It should go without saying that the racist character of the wars abroad is also a
  continuation of the racism practiced at home.</p>

  <p>It is no wonder that Marx, Engels and Lenin valued the writings of Clausewitz. This
  was not because he was sympathetic to the oppressed. Far from it! But he bluntly
  summarized the nature of war without in any way embellishing it. Clausewitz
  demonstrated that wars are not fought for their own sake, but are a continuation of the
  politics of this or that warring group.</p>

  <h4>What's behind imperialist war</h4>

  <p>In his revolutionary writings against the world war of 1914-18, Lenin ceaselessly
  pointed out that capitalist war is a function of imperialism. By imperialism he meant
  more than military aggression. He showed in his book <em>Imperialism, the Highest Stage
  of Capitalism</em> that imperialist wars grow out of the monopoly character of
  capitalism, which itself grew out of an earlier competitive stage of capital.</p>

  <p>Lenin demonstrated that the growth of monopolies generates aggressiveness in the
  struggle for world markets. That is true even more now than in Lenin's day, when
  competition among smaller capitalist units and establishments was the rule rather than
  the exception. Lenin understood the direction of capitalist development toward
  monopoly, however, and particularly promoted the concept of the relationship of the big
  banks to the capitalist state.</p>

  <p>The capitalist state is not a mere arbiter between small, struggling capitalist
  competitors. On the contrary, the capitalist state is the captive of the very largest
  and most powerful capitalist monopolies. More often than not, they have the most direct
  influence in the inner councils of the state.</p>

  <p>Marx and Engels wrote in 1848 in <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> that the
  government &mdash; that is, the state &mdash; was the executive committee of the ruling
  class. This generalization was all the more remarkable at that time, because the feudal
  and aristocratic elements still retained their hold in some European countries,
  including Germany and Italy. For the bourgeois state to become the executive committee
  of the whole ruling class, it still needed considerable development.</p>

  <p>But it was not long in coming. Compared to the period of 1848, the modern capitalist
  state demonstrates wholesale degeneration into a tool of the largest corporations
  &mdash; especially those with the closest possible relations with the military
  industries.</p>

  <h4>Monopoly rule stifles democracy</h4>

  <p>In this light, expecting more democracy from the capitalist state is utopian. On the
  contrary, both monopoly finance capital and the capitalist state are continually
  veering in the direction of rampant reaction.</p>

  <p>It's not only the latest developments of the union of finance with capitalist
  industry that demonstrate this. It was shown as long ago as 1912, when Rudolf
  Hilferding wrote the book "Finance Capital." In it, he analyzed the basic trends
  inherent in capitalist development in that period, which undoubtedly helped Lenin to
  formulate his own position.</p>

  <p>Interestingly enough, Lenin made sure to critically appraise Hilferding's book in
  relation to his remarks about the labor movement. Hilferding didn't explain the basis
  for the opportunism that had grown up during the period, when working-class
  organizations were growing in breadth but at the same time were losing their militancy
  and revolutionary perspective to some extent.</p>

  <h4>Revolutionary defeatism</h4>

  <p>In a war among imperialist powers, it is not adequate to merely oppose the war. That
  doesn't provide the masses with a realistic program to stop the carnage. Working class
  revolutionaries have to explain to the masses that the lesser evil in such a situation
  is the defeat of their own imperialist ruling class &mdash; their direct
  oppressors.</p>

  <p>Revolutionary defeatism was the successful program pursued by the Bolsheviks in
  World War I. It was on the basis of revolutionary defeatism that they won over the
  soldier masses who hated the war and the officer caste and who wanted to return to
  their homes and farms. These soldiers, most from peasant families, mutinied and then
  fought alongside the workers in ousting the government of the oppressing Russian
  landlords and capitalists. They then appealed to the German soldiers to do the same to
  their own ruling class.</p>

  <p>If each proletarian party promotes a policy of revolutionary defeatism, then there
  is the possibility of developing genuine proletarian internationalism among the workers
  of the belligerent imperialist countries instead of allowing the ruling classes to
  promote rampant chauvinism.</p>

  <p>Suppose, for instance, there were another imperialist war between the U.S. and
  Japan. It would be correct for the workers' parties in both countries to advocate and
  promote the defeat of their respective ruling classes and the strongest solidarity
  among U.S. and Japanese workers.</p>

  <h4>What class struggle boils down to</h4>

  <p>It has often been said that Karl Marx discovered the class struggle. But Marx
  himself denied this.</p>

  <p>He repeatedly said that the class struggle was known to bourgeois writers and to
  earlier societies that described the class struggles of their time.</p>

  <p>What Marx did was to show that the class struggle is connected with the material
  interests of the classes. It is not about abstract theories or morals, not just about
  liberty or freedom. The class struggle concerns the material interests of each
  class.</p>

  <p>The struggle is between the possessing ruling class, which owns the means of
  production, and the working class, which is subjected to exploitation and oppression
  precisely because the means of production are in the hands of the exploiters.</p>

  <p>Marx said this element of the class struggle &mdash; the struggle over the means of
  production &mdash; ultimately would lead to the dictatorship of the proletariat. In
  "The State and Revolution," Lenin took great pains to explain that that means the rule
  of the working class. It has nothing to do with the imposition of an autocratic or
  totalitarian authority over the workers. Rather, their freely elected representatives
  administer the workers' state.</p>

  <p>Most important, as Lenin further elaborated, the dictatorship of the proletariat is
  a transitory period. As the working class develops the means of production and
  strengthens its position in society, the proletarian dictatorship will dissolve &mdash;
  wither away, so to speak &mdash; into a classless society, or communism.</p>
