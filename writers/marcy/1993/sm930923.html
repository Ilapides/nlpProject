  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Lenin's Imperialism (Sept. 23, 1993)</title>
</head>

<body>

  <h1>Lenin's <em>Imperialism</em></h1>

  <h2>A weapon for the working class</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Sept. 23, 1993)</h5>

  <p><em>On Sept. 2, Workers World Party began a week of classes on the basic concepts of
  Marxism. Sam Marcy, WWP chairperson, opened the classes with a discussion of Lenin's
  famous book on imperialism. The following are excerpts from Marcy's talk.</em></p>

  <p>Comrades, today is an historic and glorious day for Workers World Party. It is the
  one party in this country that has called a series of meetings to go over the basic
  conceptions of revolutionary Marxism.</p>

  <p>It isn't an academic exercise. We're looking into the arsenal of weapons in the
  struggle against the imperialist bourgeoisie. We will inspect the weapons from the
  viewpoint of their readiness in the forthcoming class struggle of the working class and
  the oppressed people against capitalism and imperialism.</p>

  <p>I said it was historic for this reason: Right after the first imperialist world war
  started in 1914, and the carnage of workers began, a number of anti-war groups called a
  meeting in a neutral country. I think it was Lenin who said the important thing wasn't
  how many came, but that they came to the meeting. And having come, they considered what
  to do.</p>

  <p>In a large measure, this is what we have to do. The Marxist movement has suffered an
  August 4, 1914, catastrophe. But we are in a position to recuperate and regenerate the
  movement. And in no other place on earth is the situation more favorable objectively
  and historically than right here. This audience must not underestimate it.</p>

  <h4>Why study Marxism?</h4>

  <p>Why do we need to go over Marxism? Why can't we just assign comrades to read this
  and that and then go on to the business of the war in Nicaragua, or what's going on in
  the imperialist attacks on the DPRK, or what's happening with the Palestinians?</p>

  <p>We have to have a basic evaluation of what is going on. An examination of our
  ideological weapons. Which ones are more useful. Which are most likely to be used in
  the near future. Which are to be held for a later date.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie regard their system as eternal, not subject to fundamental change.
  This differs radically from Marxism, which teaches us that capitalism is a transitory
  social formation. Like feudalism and slavery, it will have to give way to a higher form
  of society.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie cannot given an objective assessment of the real trends in
  capitalist society. Everything they do is calculated to serve self-interest for the
  most venomous type, which goes along with imperialist brigandage all over the
  globe.</p>

  <p>Our purpose in reviewing Marxism is to prepare us for the storms and stresses of the
  next period. We have every confidence that Marx's prediction of a revolutionary storm
  will come true. We need to reexamine our basic armor with a view to its operational
  effectiveness. That is what our study is about. We will go from the abstract to the
  concrete this time around.</p>

  <p>We don't need a scholastic, pedantic recitation. We need a critical review, not from
  the viewpoint of revisionism and renunciation but from the viewpoint of reinforcing and
  strengthening the heritage that has been bequeathed to us by the great leaders of the
  past.</p>

  <p>In this short session we will look at the latest phase of capitalism, which Lenin
  called imperialism. Many decades ago he wrote the pamphlet <em>Imperialism, the Highest
  Stage of Capitalism.</em> I'm sure you're all acquainted with it. Every one of us is
  duty bound to read and study it.</p>

  <h4>Lenin's five characteristics of imperialism</h4>

  <p>There are at least five characteristics of imperialism that Lenin thought important
  in characterizing this stage of capitalism. And they are still true some 77 years
  later.</p>

  <p>He first of all mentioned the concentration of production, of capital, the
  development of competition into monopoly. How does it happen? What is the interplay
  between monopoly and competition? One doesn't replace the other. They both exist. How
  is it different today from Lenin's period?</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie is always discussing competition and monopoly. There are thousands
  of cases in the courts that deal with monopoly and competition from the point of view
  of their problems. On the one hand, they want to restrain monopoly yet they also want
  to strengthen it. They've had two world wars and another one could be coming. How do
  you restrain and foster monopoly at the same time? It's a dual process.</p>

  <p>Lenin tells us about the merging of bank capital with industrial capital and the
  creation of finance capital.</p>

  <p>Then there is the export of capital which has become extremely important as
  distinguished from the export of commodities. The U.S. exports not just commodities but
  loans all over the world. That's got to be studied. How important is this
  difference?</p>

  <p>Lenin also writes about the formation of international capitalist monopolies which
  share the world among themselves.</p>

  <p>General Electric, Westinghouse, and one or two Japanese companies share their market
  on a world basis. But it's not a stable agreement. They establish arbitrators and
  courts of arbitration to issue awards and all that, but they don't keep the agreements,
  basically because they are thieves and pirates. It's utopian expect them to have
  gentlemen's agreements among themselves, especially when billions of dollars are at
  stake.</p>

  <h4>Redivision of the world</h4>

  <p>According to Lenin, the world was already shared out among the great capitalist
  powers when he wrote <em>Imperialism</em> in 1916. The wars since have invalidated a
  lot of this. Some imperialist countries have become stronger and others weaker. Japan
  has become stronger. Britain, Holland, Belgium, and others have become weaker. What has
  taken their place, of course, is U.S. imperialism. It attempts to take over everything
  that is not nailed down.</p>

  <p>A fundamental feature of imperialism is also the fusion of the capitalist state with
  the banks and industry. The industrialists carry on a struggle to maintain some form of
  independence among themselves as against the finance capitalists, but this independence
  is overturned and giant financial and industrial corporations get fused. This doesn't
  solve the contradiction, but brings it within a certain area of agreement.</p>

  <h4>Henry Ford and finance capital</h4>

  <p>Let me give you an example of what Lenin means about the fusion of industry with
  finance capital. Henry Ford and his empire existed for a considerable period as a
  family unit. No banks, no insurance companies owned the Ford company. It all belonged
  to one family.</p>

  <p>He was so fearful that Wall Street, meaning the bankers, would take it over that he
  launched an anti-Semitic campaign. He subsidized two or three publications of an
  anti-Semitic character in order to chastise and expose Wall Street.</p>

  <p>What was the real problem? He didn't want his industrial empire to succumb to
  finance capital. He wanted it to stay in the family.</p>

  <p>From the Leninist conception of imperialism, this meant that Ford, as an
  industrialist, was attempting to ward off the fusion of finance capital with his
  industrial empire. In the end he and his son capitulated. They made it a stockholding
  company where everybody could buy the stock. The Wall Street firms that sell and float
  stocks, that lend and borrow money, made it like any other corporation &mdash; General
  Motors, Chrysler, IBM and so on.</p>

  <p>It showed how it's not possible to be an independent entity in the imperialist
  epoch. Least of all, you can't keep the banks out unless you want to lose money.
  Ultimately, Ford capitulated to the financiers because he would have lost the
  competitive edge if he tried to stay independent.</p>

  <h4>The Thinking Machine Corp.</h4>

  <p>I would like to give you a more modern example. There's a company called The
  Thinking Machine Corp. It develops very sophisticated, advanced computer technology.
  It's not one of the Fortune 500 companies, but it does sell computers around the world,
  to the tune of $100 million.</p>

  <p>Recently this little company with about 500 workers was going through a shakeup in
  the leadership &mdash; all of whom were experts in high technology. They decided they
  wanted a new chief executive from the outside. Sometimes when an organization can't
  function because of disagreements among themselves, it's best to get somebody from the
  outside.</p>

  <p>So what did they do? The got somebody named Harold Fishman, a lawyer in the biggest
  corporate law firm in the U.S., and asked him to become the head of The Thinking
  Machine.</p>

  <p>If they wanted somebody from the outside, why in the world pick a Wall Street lawyer
  who doesn't know anything about technology? How is he going to run the corporation? The
  questions was asked publicly. Why go to Wall Street? He is very brilliant, he's got all
  the qualities that a lawyer and a corporate manager should have. But he is not a
  technology leader. So why get him?</p>

  <p>IBM had laid off a lot of technology-wise executives. So had others. A great pool of
  talent is unemployed. Why go to Wall Street to hire Fishman?</p>

  <p>It indicates that financial interests, marketing and the business of gains and
  losses take precedence over the needs of technological developments.</p>

  <p>There's a socialist principle involved in this. In a socialist U.S., production
  would be regulated by the workers in the interest of production for use. If this were a
  project in a socialist country, it might be necessary to call somebody in to settle the
  differences. But it wouldn't be a corporate lawyer. It would be another technology
  leader.</p>

  <p>For a while, it was progressive for industrial capitalism to gain advantages in the
  marketplace through the financiers. That financed the industrial base and helped it
  grow. But having established that, it strengthened parasitism.</p>

  <p>It's important for us to understand the inner workings, the mechanism of the
  relationship between imperialist industry and imperialist finance. And if this is not
  an example of the decay of imperialism, then I don't know what is.</p>

  <p>This example of The Thinking Machine also illustrates the fusion of the capitalist
  state with industry and finance, because they wouldn't be able to sell many
  supercomputers around the world unless the vast army of U.S. officials were helpful in
  beating the competition.</p>

  <h4>Fusion of finance capital and the state</h4>

  <p>There's still another aspect of imperialism that I should mention. Among the five
  characteristics that we have, this one is helpful in understanding a number of the
  others.</p>

  <p>The capitalist state as we know it has three arms &mdash; the executive, the
  legislative and the judicial. The legislative is the most popular and has the power of
  the purse.</p>

  <p>The ruling class has always been fearful of a popularly elected body, especially
  after the passage of the Civil Rights Act.</p>

  <p>But if you hand the members of Congress the budget of the United States, or a bill
  on how to sell bananas or computers, you'll pretty soon see that your congressperson
  may not know much.</p>

  <p>The ruling class has established a stratum of extra-governmental, extra-state
  personnel who make up an unofficial political arm of the capitalist state. They are
  called lobbyists. They are a power over and above the elected representatives.</p>

  <p>If I ask my congressperson about how to get into the sugar business, they'll tell me
  to come back after they've looked into it. But if I were a big bourgeois in business, I
  wouldn't go to the congressperson. I would go to the lobbyist. The lobbyist has all the
  bills about sugar. As soon as the first one comes off the printing press, the lobbyist
  already has it.</p>

  <p>If you need an interpretation, the lobbyist has it. If you ask which congressperson
  voted for what, they'll tell you that, too. And furthermore, they work day and night
  and are omnipresent in Washington, in some of the most fashionable and richest
  houses.</p>

  <p>Lobbying has erected a governmental apparatus over and above the Congress that has
  grown stronger and stronger in the epoch of imperialism. It's an extra-legal apparatus
  to circumvent the legislative process as outlined in the Constitution.</p>

  <p>For that reason, Leninists have always regarded suffrage and popular elections as
  merely a method of mobilizing the masses, of trying to educate the masses. But not
  really of accomplishing anything.</p>
