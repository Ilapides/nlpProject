  <h1>An era that begs for working-class leadership</h1>

  <h2>WWP Chairperson Sam Marcy at May Day rally</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (May 13, 1993)</h5>

  <p>Comrades and friends,</p>

  <p>Our party has the greatest interest in the world class struggle. For many years
  after our party was founded in 1959, we had very little support from the vanguard
  international revolutionary movements.</p>

  <p>Before we undertook to build the party, we knew we would be isolated. Yet we
  nevertheless were ready to reach out to the millions, to the workers of the world
  represented by the most advanced communist elements.</p>

  <p>Today we have more than 20 messages from the international community of communists.
  It is a great source of confidence that the party has gotten recognition, and is today
  in struggle for a vanguard position in the world communist movement.</p>

  <p>For instance, we have representation here today from the Congo &mdash; Zaire. Small
  as the party was during the struggle of Patrice Lumumba, we were the only party to have
  a demonstration. When their delegation was detained at Ellis Island, it was your
  chairperson who went to get their release, even if he had to use his "professionalism"
  as an attorney. That's how our relations with the workers and peasants of the Congo
  began.</p>

  <p>India now has close to a billion people. The Communist Party of India-Marxist, which
  sent us a message, represents millions. It is a sign of the validity of our party as a
  living, struggling organization that they sent us a message.</p>

  <p>When the Bhopal disaster took place in India, we were the only organization in this
  country that had a demonstration against the Union Carbide company and against U.S.
  imperialist investments.</p>

  <p>We consider one of our most important characteristics as a revolutionary party that,
  in the heartland of U.S. imperialism, we share none of the arrogance that characterizes
  U.S. organizations. We learn from others and are assimilating the experiences of the
  international movement, paying closest attention to relations with our colleagues, with
  our comrades and allies.</p>

  <p>The counterrevolution in Russia chose this particular day, May Day, to attack a
  revolutionary demonstration led by the Russian Communist Workers Party &mdash; a party
  that sees eye to eye with us on the grave issues concerning the Soviet Union and the
  world.</p>

  <h4>For the revolution or against it?</h4>

  <p>They beat the workers with truncheons to show their relationship to the old czarist
  regime. I hadn't intended to open up my discussion on the Russian question, but the
  attitude towards the Soviet Union has been key since day one of the revolution. Are you
  for the revolution or against it?</p>

  <p>While recognizing the deficiencies in the Soviet Union, and when necessary
  distancing ourselves from the leadership, we always supported the Soviet Union as a
  social structure, as a workers' state. No organization in the United States even came
  close to us in that kind of support.</p>

  <p>Many supported the Soviet Union uncritically when it was strong. But our policy of
  having a revolutionary, critical attitude toward all social phenomena is what the
  working class in the United States needs most.</p>

  <p>It would be an error on our part to neglect the domestic situation in the United
  States, and confine ourselves to the international questions. We must rise to the
  occasion and raise the international questions as part of the domestic class struggle
  in the U.S.</p>

  <p>We all are aware, for instance, that the Pentagon has spent $4 trillion since 1980.
  A billion dollars is a lot of money. Ten billion dollars is a lot of money. A hundred
  billion dollars is a lot of money. A thousand billion dollars is a lot of money. But
  four trillion! It is an almost impossible number. <strong>Four trillion is four times a
  thousand billion.</strong></p>

  <p>Why do I raise it? Because some time ago, Clinton asked the Congress, where he has a
  majority in both houses, to appropriate money for jobs. He asked for $26 billion.
  That's like asking for pennies by comparison.</p>

  <p>And what does the Congress do? It refuses and cuts it down to $4 billion. How can
  they spend $4 trillion on "defense" and $26 billion on jobs!</p>

  <p>Is it greed? The most exorbitant and outlandish form of greed?</p>

  <h4>Greed yes, but more</h4>

  <p>Yes, it is greed. But it is more than that. Greed is a characteristic of all ruling
  classes. Under slavery and feudalism, wherever there are rich and poor, there is greed.
  But something else is involved here.</p>

  <p>It is the nature of the capitalist crisis. It is the fact that there is a highly
  excessive amount of unemployment, caused by capitalist overproduction.</p>

  <p>Clinton didn't even ask them to take money straight out of the Treasury and give it
  to workers who are unemployed. He said, I will fight for a tax break for the
  corporations so they can invest in industry and employ workers.</p>

  <p>How much kinder can you be to the ruling class?</p>

  <p>It is all because of the capitalist crisis. It is not only in the United States. It
  is in Japan, Britain, France, spreading throughout all of Europe, in Latin America,
  everywhere.</p>

  <p>Why did the ruling class turn down Clinton's proposal to give them money to invest
  and build? Because the country is overbuilt from their point of view. There is
  excessive investment and excessive production &mdash; over and beyond what the working
  class can consume with the limited amount of money they have available.</p>

  <p>The whole world economy is slowing down at the same time. And now there is the same
  unemployment in Hungary, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria &mdash; wherever they have adopted
  the capitalist reforms.</p>

  <p>This is an era that begs for working-class leadership to organize and prepare for
  the coming struggle. This situation cannot continue for a long time.</p>

  <p>Without tiring the audience with statistics, I want to bring this out. Last year the
  workers in this country produced $6 trillion worth of goods and services, the so-called
  gross domestic product. It's a world record. They tell you that U.S. workers can't
  produce. They compare them sometimes to the Japanese workers, U.S. workers are lazy and
  all that. Yet because the system is run for profit instead of for use, it is unable to
  provide the working class a living. The decline in the standard of living continues
  unabated.</p>

  <p>The capitalist system is not characterized by scarcity. It is characterized by
  superabundance of products and productivity. That is its problem. The lust for profit
  is stronger than any other motive. It is the only system which produces in abundance to
  such an extent that it leads to a crisis of poverty amid surplus.</p>

  <h4>Imperialist economy needs stimulant</h4>

  <p>The Gulf war, Somalia, Panama, the most recent and outrageous intervention in the
  Balkans &mdash; what does this show? That they are unable to put their system in order
  without an artificial stimulant like militarism.</p>

  <p>Why does the U.S. need to go into the Balkans? They have everything they could want
  from the Balkans. Yugoslavia was open to investment, open to exploitation. It has not
  been hostile to U.S. imperialism. It has an open-door policy. Why have they rounded up
  their rival allies and gotten into it?</p>

  <p>For one, it is a diversion from the domestic struggle; for another, it is part and
  parcel of the organic expansionism of capitalist imperialism throughout the whole
  world, leaving no stone unturned.</p>

  <p>What is happening in the small Balkan countries is a re-run of what happened in the
  First World War. The imperialist robbers were redividing the world &mdash; all its
  resources, its markets, in fact all its assets.</p>

  <p>This little group of small, independent countries stood in the way. It was necessary
  to swallow them up in some way in order to make the greater war.</p>

  <p>Many socialists at the time tried to analyze the First World War on the basis of
  what was going on in the Balkans. What did it mean to have the Serbians on one side,
  the Bosnians on the other, or the Croats?</p>

  <p>It remained for the few who remained true to revolutionary Marxism to come up with
  the answer. And they said, in so many words: Don't look at this small country for the
  answers as to why the imperialists are getting there. Look at the imperialists
  themselves. They have no business there. The struggle is for the survival of one
  imperialist group of nations as against another.</p>

  <p>What is happening among the nationalities should not be the cause of imperialist
  intervention. They should stay out of it. That was the Leninist position.</p>

  <h4>Revolutionary defeatism</h4>

  <p>Do not take sides with any of the imperialist countries. Do not embellish one as
  against another. They are equally predatory and vicious, and are concerned mostly with
  their own profits. The tactic of the proletariat, Lenin said, is to carry out
  revolutionary defeatism.</p>

  <p>The goal is to defeat each one of the imperialist countries on the basis of
  international solidarity, and not get enmeshed in the intricacies of the national
  question in the Balkans. Give them the opportunity to solve it &mdash; as they did when
  they formed a federation.</p>

  <p>Whoever came out on a May Day demonstration during the First World War was
  immediately recognized as anti-imperialist and pro-socialist. This is what we have to
  revive.</p>

  <p>The tears being shed for Bosnia should not be taken for good coin. They are
  crocodile tears. The imperialists could just as well start crying for Serbia tomorrow,
  or for the Croats, depending upon how the imperialists view each other's interest.</p>

  <p>Marxism teaches the workers not to go by vague political sympathies or nationalities
  alone but to look for the class interests. There is no interest for the working class
  of the U.S., or France or Britain to go into Bosnia or Serbia.</p>

  <p>We look forward to the regeneration of the USSR. No social system ever goes down to
  defeat unless its potentialities have been thoroughly exhausted. And the potential of
  the former USSR is by no means exhausted. The working class has not been defeated in a
  decisive battle. As we said in the last issue of our paper, the struggle is still by
  word of mouth and propaganda. The decisive struggle between the counterrevolution and
  the proletariat is still to come. And we are solidly on the side of the proletariat and
  against the counterrevolution and the imperialists who support it all over the
  world.</p>

  <p>Long Live the Socialist Revolution! We rededicate ourselves on this day to a firmer
  and more consistent struggle against imperialism and capitalism. Long Live Workers
  World Party!</p>
