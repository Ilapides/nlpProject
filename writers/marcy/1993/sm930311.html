  <h1>Issues behind the World Trade Center explosion</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 11, 1993)</h5>

  <p>Now that the excitement over the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York has
  died down somewhat, it is important to consider the propensity of the U.S. ruling class
  to find scapegoats whenever they find themselves in a tight spot. One need only
  remember the cases of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, or of Sacco and Vanzetti, and the
  racist frameup of the Scottsboro Nine. For the moment, however, the momentum for such a
  frameup in connection with the huge explosion at the World Trade Center seems to be
  slowing down.</p>

  <p>The reason is not loss of interest by the most reactionary forces in the capitalist
  government or lack of eagerness to pin the disaster on individual groupings &mdash;
  "foreign terrorists." They seem to be coming up against resistance from imperialist
  governments in Europe that have huge stakes in the Balkans and elsewhere in direct
  conflict with U.S. imperialist interests.</p>

  <p>If we view it in this context, we will get a better, more accurate perspective on
  developments arising from the disaster at the Trade Center.</p>

  <h4>Cuomo's message from Mitterrand</h4>

  <p>Consider this: When New York Governor Mario Cuomo went on TV to give a long
  explanation of what had happened, he made reference to a message he received from
  President Francois Mitterrand of France expressing condolences for the loss of lives.
  This could not but attract a great deal of attention in the diplomatic corps of the
  U.S.</p>

  <p>Cuomo didn't actually read the message of condolence. Was it a warning against
  launching a massive "terrorist-hunting" campaign? We can only speculate. Suffice it to
  say that Cuomo should have at least read a letter coming from one of the most important
  imperialist states in Europe, instead of making short shrift of it.</p>

  <p>Why was it that the president of France conveyed his condolences not to President
  Clinton but to the governor? And, if condolences are in order from the heads of
  European states, why have we only heard about Mitterrand? Why not Prime Minister Helmut
  Kohl of Germany, or Prime Minister John Major of Britain? Or from other European
  countries, like Portugal and Spain?</p>

  <p>It is France's imperialist interests that are most at loggerheads with those of the
  U.S. right now in the Balkan states that used to be part of Yugoslavia. It was about a
  year ago that Mitterrand, in his capacity as president, not as a private citizen,
  braved heavy shelling and went personally to Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina to prove a
  point. His point was to establish France's deep concern in an area to which the U.S. is
  laying claim. In this area today the U.S. is using every kind of trick and device, from
  secret diplomacy to airlifts of food and propaganda, to cover its predatory
  interests.</p>

  <p>We can easily see what difficulty the U.S. is having from a hostile population. The
  Pentagon has to resort to a leaflet campaign before dropping food parcels from the air.
  The Nazis used that method during the World War II, with miserable results.</p>

  <h4>Clinton's Eurobashing</h4>

  <p>It is no wonder that Mitterrand's message was not sent to Clinton. It was only a few
  days earlier that Clinton had launched a violent attack against the Airbus, a joint
  venture of France, Germany, Britain and Spain, calling it a major threat to the U.S.
  aviation industry. Right after his State of the Union address, Clinton visited the
  Boeing plant in Seattle and took time to directly attack the Airbus project as
  endangering the jobs of American workers. He made no bones about specifically naming
  the Airbus, thereby beginning a campaign of Eurobashing similar to the chauvinist
  offensive against Japan so prevalent in the Reagan-Bush era.</p>

  <p>All this was small consolation to the 28,000 workers at Boeing who, despite
  Clinton's talk promising prosperity down the road, are still getting pink slips.</p>

  <p>But back to the World Trade Center explosion. Any conspiracy theory that involves
  Yugoslav terrorists, especially Bosnian Serbs, is bound to be viewed with the greatest
  skepticism in France and throughout Europe. While the European imperialists are as
  eager as the multinational corporations of the U.S. to gain whatever economic and
  political advantage they can out of the destruction of the Socialist Federation of
  Yugoslavia. They are not at all eager to pull any chestnuts out of the fire in
  Yugoslavia in the interests of the U.S.</p>

  <p>Clinton's admonition on March 1 to the people of the United States not to
  "overreact" to the frenzied campaign against foreign terrorists seemed a departure from
  the track record of past U.S. presidents. They have seemingly delighted in whipping up
  hysteria, especially against liberation movements in the Third World. But it has to be
  seen in the context of the international competition of the great imperialist
  fraternity of predators.</p>

  <p>Japanese imperialism, for instance, is not out front in this particular campaign
  involving the explosion, even though offices occupied by some of its biggest
  corporations suffered major disruption and damage in the blast. This is strictly a
  U.S.-European imperialist conflict.</p>

  <h4>Who'll pay?</h4>

  <p>None of this should be interpreted as meaning that the repressive forces of the
  capitalist government are losing interest in a frameup that could get the vast
  financial and economic interests concentrated in the Trade Center off the hook when it
  comes to paying the costs of the damage.</p>

  <p>Notice with what speed and alacrity both Mayor David Dinkins and Cuomo asked the
  federal government for disaster relief. Together with practically all the other
  capitalist politicians in the country they had joined in the campaign to cut the
  federal budget, yet now have suddenly discarded that approach. In his talk, Cuomo said
  that the budget now is of no concern &mdash; an incredible statement from one who
  usually measures his words carefully.</p>

  <p>The Disaster Relief Administration was originally set up to provide relief in
  natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, etc. The laws governing the DRA are so
  stringent when it comes to actually giving out money that thousands of victims of the
  hurricanes in Florida and North Carolina are complaining they are still homeless months
  and even years after those disasters &mdash; all because of the government's delay in
  sending out relief checks. Of course, it is the workers and poor, especially Black and
  Latin, who are left hanging while businesses sometimes get relief in a matter of days
  or weeks.</p>

  <p>Instead of appealing for government funds, the Port Authority should see to it that
  its private insurers take care of the claims in connection with the Trade Center
  disaster. Don't the capitalists and their politicians always want to turn everything
  over to the private sector? But here, all of a sudden, all that is forgotten and they
  are running to the public treasury.</p>

  <h4>What about the workers?</h4>

  <p>The most damning indictment against both Dinkins and Cuomo is that neither one has
  directed his attention clearly and specifically to the workers, many of whom may suffer
  long-term health problems, and some of whom risk losing not just work time but their
  jobs altogether. Again and again, it is mentioned that 55,000 workers are employed
  there. But who is monitoring the status of their health?</p>

  <p>This disaster, like everything else that happens in class society, has to be viewed
  as a political struggle. Let's discount all the flattery of the capitalist politicians
  with their effusive praise of the bravery and fortitude of the masses. We know all
  that. We don't need an overflow of sentimentality to cover up their crass attitude
  towards those who are losing economically.</p>

  <p>In a society divided into classes, the working class has to view even a disaster
  like this from the viewpoint of its class interests. The capitalist politicians
  certainly look at it from the class interests of the dozens of multinational
  corporations and the losses they may face.</p>

  <p>Up until now, the World Trade Center was chiefly known as a valuable piece of real
  estate, where big deals, giant commercial transactions and financial manipulations are
  made and unmade. Almost never mentioned is the great concentration of 55,000 workers
  who daily contribute and indeed are indispensable to the operation of the center. The
  explosion demonstrated in a negative way how really important the workers are.</p>

  <p>The explosion showed that the two towers are not just concentrations of commerce and
  finance. There are also living human beings there, who from a class point of view are
  workers, and that without them nothing operates. It is potentially a fortress of the
  working class. The sooner the consciousness of this develops the better it will be for
  all working people.</p>

  <p>One of Karl Marx's celebrated maxims is that behind every political struggle is a
  raging class struggle. The workers should first of all direct their attention to
  defending their side in this struggle and be cognizant of the antagonistic interests of
  the multinational corporations and banks.</p>
