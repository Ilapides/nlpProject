  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Yeltsin, the Congress and state property (March 25,
  1993)</title>

  <h1>Yeltsin, the Congress and state property</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 25, 1993)</h5>

  <p>Now that the Congress of Peoples Deputies has administered a rebuff to Russian
  President Boris Yeltsin, and has thereby restricted his attempt to enlarge his
  political power, it has adjourned in a triumphant mood. The most urgent task facing the
  congress now is how to stop the surge in privatization of state property and the
  growing spiral of inflation.</p>

  <p>The current struggle in Russia is not merely the usual parliamentary tussle between
  the legislative and the executive branches that occurs so many times in the development
  of a bourgeois state. If that were all it were, the struggle would have considerably
  less significance for the working class and the progressive sections of society in
  Russia.</p>

  <p>By contrast, consider the history of U.S. bourgeois politics. Often one special
  interest or another captures a branch of the bourgeois state. Sometimes very large
  corporations hold a branch of the government for a period of time. The most
  conservative elements, for example, generally make the judicial arm their province.
  While the struggles between the branches may be important to the special interests,
  they do not fundamentally alter relations between the workers and the capitalists.</p>

  <p>In Russia the struggle between the two branches of government, between the Yeltsin
  executive and the Congress of Peoples Deputies, is an expression of the class struggle.
  That does not necessarily imply that the social composition of the congress is working
  class or that it directly represents the working class. But the outcome of this
  struggle is nevertheless fundamental to the class struggle.</p>

  <p>Also, what is at stake in Russia is not merely the difference between public
  ownership and privatization as these terms are applied in bourgeois politics. For
  example, in Britain after World War II, the capitalist government headed by a Labor
  Party prime minister carried out nationalizations of the railroads, steel and other
  industries. But this still did not raise it above the level of bourgeois property,
  because the nationalizations left the bourgeoisie intact as the ruling class. Later,
  during the 1980s, much of the previously nationalized industry was handed back to
  private interests. Privatizing in Britain did not change the class content of the
  property.</p>

  <p>The Bolshevik Revolution, on the other hand, was the first to expropriate the
  bourgeoisie both politically and economically, putting the nationalized property in the
  hands of a workers' state &mdash; a clear transfer from one class to another.</p>

  <p>The issue in Russia is the privatization of socialized property and the
  dismemberment of socialist production. It is thereby fundamental to the class
  struggle.</p>

  <p>Unless the Russian Congress of Peoples Deputies gives priority to the two
  fundamental issues of privatization and inflation and takes clear-cut measures to halt
  both these plagues, the country faces the danger of falling completely into the arms of
  the seven imperialist robbers, the so-called G7 countries.</p>

  <h4>The congress must say: `No more'</h4>

  <p>The issue is whether the congress will allow the bloodletting of socialized
  industries or will take immediate steps to say, "no more." It must at the same time
  order an exact accounting of the many state enterprises that have already been
  privatized. They should be immediately repossessed.</p>

  <p>The congress must also order an accounting of what happened to the enterprises since
  they were taken from state control and privatized. What happened to the work force? How
  many workers were laid off or new ones hired? How much money was spent in the process?
  Where did the money come from? Was it borrowed from the central bank? Is the management
  under the direction of the congress or of officials reporting to Yeltsin?</p>

  <p>These are the most important questions with respect to privatization or
  socialization. These are the acid questions. The future of socialism depends upon
  questions of this type.</p>

  <p>One concrete example is the Moscow region's Zil factory, which produces limousines.
  According to a March 16 Associated Press report, it is now being privatized. By what
  authority is this state enterprise, which employs as many as 100,000 workers and has 14
  other plants across the country, to become privately owned?</p>

  <p>If the congress cannot take immediate measures to halt wholesale privatization of
  such important industrial complexes, then it must admit it has no authority whatever.
  This is not a question of privatization involving some small vegetable stores. It goes
  to the very heart of industrial projects built over decades of socialist
  construction.</p>

  <p>The issue should not be confused with the question of who purchases the enterprises
  at the present time. That issue should be separated.</p>

  <p>It is not enough for the congress to reduce the powers of Yeltsin. It is not even
  clear which of his powers have been reduced at the present time. The issue is how to
  halt privatization, to stop the bloodletting of socialist property, the most basic
  asset of the government.</p>

  <h4>Who controls the central bank?</h4>

  <p>An equally important issue concerns the central bank. Its borrowing and lending
  powers must be under the full control of the congress. Even in capitalist governments,
  whether monarchies, military dictatorships or capitalist democracies, the state bank is
  under the control of whatever parliamentary institution is in existence. In the U.S.,
  for example, only Congress has authority to print and coin money and control the
  currency.</p>

  <p>The Federal Reserve Bank in the U.S. regularly has to report to Congress and give
  the details of its borrowing and lending operations. If in Russia these banking
  operations continue to remain in hands other than the Congress of Peoples Deputies, it
  means the congress does not have the power of the purse and thus has no control.</p>

  <p>Now those are delicate matters, of course. They require considerable proficiency and
  knowledge of the inner operations of the bank. But this is not 1917 when the Soviet
  Union had none of its own experts and the bourgeois elements were deserting to the
  counter-revolution. Even then the Soviet government, as soon as it had defeated the
  White armies, established a stable currency and put the central bank under the
  government's jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>The Congress of Peoples Deputies cannot permit any divided authority between the
  executive and itself. The two are at cross purposes. The Yeltsin reactionary forces
  cannot but play a destructive role for the economy of the country.</p>

  <p>Now is the best time for the congress to move swiftly to arrogate to itself the
  powers that normally belong to a congress. The Yeltsin rapid-fire acceleration of
  privatization has demonstrated the complete bankruptcy of trying to foist on the
  country an old and easily recognizable form of capitalist exploitation and oppression.
  It's a model of what existed before the October 1917 Revolution. It's why the workers
  and peasants rebelled. It made richer those who were rich, took from the peasants what
  they still possessed and deprived the workers of the fruits of their labor.</p>

  <h4>Reaction of the Yeltsin forces</h4>

  <p>While the congress may feel triumphant, Yeltsin and his supporters are now sulking.
  They have taken as their best defense an ideological assault on the congress. They
  accuse it of moving toward establishing a communist state.</p>

  <p>There is plenty in this latest development that could give Yeltsin pause to
  contemplate his new situation. Yeltsin started his career as an engineer and made his
  way to the top in the Sverdlovsk region basically on his engineering and technical
  ability. That was his strong point.</p>

  <p>He early showed an aptitude for bulling his way through to the top in his varying
  jobs. All through that career he seemed to easily collaborate and even win his way with
  the party leadership, with the bureaucracy, which he later began to demean and finally
  to ferociously attack.</p>

  <p>The problem he had as an engineer was how to collaborate in the party apparatus.
  This apparatus, as the political instrument of proletarian rule, found it essential,
  even indispensable, to recruit into itself the technical intelligentsia, not only
  scientists and doctors but above all the industrial managers who soon became
  "technocrats."</p>

  <p>As long as the party was a revolutionary working class party true to its own goals,
  it seemed able to manage a more-or-less easy relationship between the "technocrats" and
  the party revolutionaries. It would of course have been fortunate for the party if the
  technical intelligentsia and especially the industrial managers of huge complexes were
  to become working-class revolutionaries intent on utilizing their skills and abilities
  to merge with the socialist goal, all with a view of remaking the old society of
  exploiters and oppressors into the new communist society.</p>

  <p>In the rush to industrialize, which did achieve tremendous successes in the early
  decades of the USSR, it is easy to see how the great industrial progress and the
  raising of the living standards of the masses could easily mask the loss of
  revolutionary idealism: the struggle for socialist equality.</p>

  <p>These are only some of the problems faced by the first socialist society. We leave
  aside, for example, the extreme harshness of the task of socialist construction in an
  ill-developed country intent, on the basis of its successes, on achieving a world
  standing comparable to that of the advanced imperialist countries.</p>

  <h4>Moving up the ladder</h4>

  <p>But much had changed by the time Boris Yeltsin became a full-fledged engineer and
  was moving up the ladder in the Sverdlovsk area, where he could rightfully boast of
  industrial success. Yeltsin was not of the generation of the early 1920s. He was not
  one of those inspired to industrialization on the basis of socialist idealism. Least of
  all was he a visionary who saw communism as the ideal for which he would strive.</p>

  <p>Political conditions in Sverdlovsk at the time favored no such conception. In his
  autobiography, <em>Against the Grain,</em> Yeltsin does not in the slightest give the
  impression that he was striving toward communism. Reading it closely, one is easily
  convinced that he was a climber in the bureaucratic apparatus.</p>

  <p>He, as a technocrat, as a climber, bulled his way through because the political
  machine in the party lent itself more and more to accommodation with the technical
  intelligentsia, with the industrial managers.</p>

  <h4>Who ran the party?</h4>

  <p>The issue is who really ran the party &mdash; was it the industrial aristocracy or
  was it the political apparatus nurtured through years in the struggle? This question
  was never sharply posed for solution. It was always compromised.</p>

  <p>Thus Alexei Kosygin, regarded as a technocrat, could be selected as prime minister
  at the same time Leonid Brezhnev, a political organizer, could be elected party leader.
  When Mikhail Gorbachev brought Yeltsin from the Sverdlovsk region into the Moscow party
  leadership, it was a way (whether he intended it or not) to bolster Gorbachev's
  political leadership on the basis of having an ally clearly representing the industrial
  aristocracy, the technocrats.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev's motives in elevating Yeltsin, however, were also to strengthen his views
  &mdash; then regarded as "liberal," actually bourgeois views &mdash; against
  "conservatives" such as Yegor Ligachev, also called the "hard-liners." Yeltsin soon
  began to go beyond anything that Gorbachev had anticipated in expounding his reforms.
  Yeltsin's view of accelerating Gorbachev's bourgeois reforms was to plunge into the
  wholesale abandonment of socialism. The imperialist press recognized very early that
  Gorbachev himself was at wit's end about what to do.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin associated with the so-called Interregional Group for Democratic Reforms. As
  he put it in his autobiography: "There are not many points of principle that divide the
  so-called rightists and leftists of the [interregional] group. No doubt, the main one
  is the question of property. If one accepts the private ownership of property, then
  this means the collapse of the main buttress that supports the state's monopoly of
  property ownership and everything that stems from it. . . ." Essentially, this is what
  Yeltsin embraced.</p>

  <p>This is how every capitalist politician understands freedom, liberty, democracy, and
  so on &mdash; the freedom to own property to exploit others. The property problem is
  the quintessence of the class struggle.</p>

  <p>Compared to other capitalist politicians, Yeltsin has an Achilles' heel: a
  technocratic view of how to overthrow the socialist structures still in place in
  Russia. It is one thing when an engineer is given a job to construct a dam or railroad
  or drain a river. You can have all the ability in the world and yet not succeed if you
  are politically opposed by the central committee &mdash; or, in the capitalist
  countries, by the government.</p>

  <h4>Yeltsin's problem</h4>

  <p>But it is altogether different when you as an engineer, as a technocrat, also gain
  the political power to bull your way through, to push a political project as though it
  were an industrial one. Then you face your supreme test. This basically, is the problem
  of Yeltsin.</p>

  <p>He was successful as long as the party leadership permitted him to push his
  bourgeois reforms and disregarded the dire consequences to the broad public of workers,
  peasants and intellectuals. It was something else when it became impossible for the
  party leadership as a whole to live with this.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin's great fortune was the ill-fated attempt in August 1991 by the party
  leadership to overcome Gorbachev and his supporters with a coup attempt. Were it not
  for that, Yeltsin would have been removed, because he was antagonizing practically all
  sections of the population &mdash; except for the speculators, the thieves, the
  embezzlers, the quick-buck elite in the bureaucracy and in the bourgeois
  intelligentsia, not to speak of those who were already making their bundle in the
  flourishing private sector as a result of the Gorbachev reforms.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, it would not be a bad recommendation to Yeltsin to ponder his
  situation. His fleeting popularity resulted from an unfortunate conjuncture of events
  in the USSR: Gorbachev's mistake, for instance, in bringing Yeltsin to the fore simply
  to undermine the Ligachev opposition, only to have Yeltsin turn against him.</p>

  <p>Since the August 1991 coup attempt, with the experience of Yeltsin as president of
  Russia and not forgetting for a moment the dismembering of the USSR, what has been the
  result? Yeltsin's economic policies (and Gorbachev's before him) have been so
  devastating that it is virtually impossible to avoid a greater disaster if he continues
  to follow through.</p>

  <p>The imperialists are shying away from any kind of real support for anyone whom they
  think might resuscitate the socialist system or strengthen the socialized aspects of
  the USSR. Yeltsin is certainly not in that category, yet because he has such narrow
  popular support in Russia, the imperialists have little confidence in him.</p>

  <p>The Congress of Deputies, regardless of its divisions into right, left and center,
  is far more representative of Russia today than Yeltsin could possibly claim to be.</p>
