  <h1>New aspect of the struggle in Russia</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (August 12,1993)</h5>

  <p>A potentially significant move to limit the growing financial and economic
  stranglehold of U.S. and other imperialist powers on the economy of the former Soviet
  Union has been torpedoed only one day after it was initiated.</p>

  <p>The developments took the form of a contest between the head of Russia's central
  bank and some of the other high-ranking officials of the reactionary Yeltsin camarilla
  now running the former Soviet republic. But because they centered on relatively obscure
  economic and financial matters, the meaning of the moves was camouflaged.</p>

  <p>On July 24 the central bank announced that all bank notes printed before 1993 would
  be withdrawn from circulation by July 26.</p>

  <p>Now, ordinary Russian workers do not usually have bank notes. If they do, it is in
  small amounts. U.S. savings bonds would be a parallel. Many workers in this country
  bought them, especially during World War II, but they're not the primary currency.</p>

  <p>However, there is a difference. An untold number of Russian bank notes have been
  accumulated over the years. They are in the hands of big speculators, new elements that
  have rapidly been growing into a formidable new financial bourgeoisie. This grouping
  rivals even those who have bought into the socialized industry over the years,
  particularly since the demise of the Gorbachev regime and the Yeltsin takeover.</p>

  <p>There are vast numbers of bank notes, and they are easily convertible into rubles or
  dollars. The scheme behind the currency change &mdash; which is what the move really
  amounts to &mdash; is to find out who owns the bank notes.</p>

  <h4>Sudden change of heart</h4>

  <p>In a statement explaining its action, the central bank said it was necessary to rein
  in inflation and get a better hold on the money supply. This is what any number of
  capitalist governments have done over many years as anti-inflationary measures to shore
  up the capitalist economy.</p>

  <p>When the Russian central bank announced its decision, it initially provoked no
  significant opposition from other government officials. Yeltsin said it would be a
  helpful measure.</p>

  <p>But within 24 hours all those officials, from Yeltsin down, suddenly changed their
  position drastically. What had happened to change their minds? The U.S. government had
  jumped in with both feet.</p>

  <h4>Enter the Harvard professor</h4>

  <p>For one thing, the Russians got a lecture from a certain Mr. Jeffrey Sachs, a
  Harvard professor who has been an adviser to the Russian Ministry of Finance. He is
  really a police watchdog put there by the U.S. and other imperialist powers to monitor
  the financial affairs of the Russian republic.</p>

  <p>Russia is a country of 150 million people, with vast resources and vast economic and
  financial experience over many decades of socialist construction. The very idea that
  this country would accede to having its Ministry of Finance policed by the imperialist
  powers is so humiliating that it must be hard for an ordinary Russian to believe.</p>

  <p>True to his mission as a loyal flunky of the imperialist government, Sachs
  immediately alerted Washington of what was afoot. He advised the U.S. that the Yeltsin
  government had taken this measure without consulting him or the International Monetary
  Fund &mdash; or anybody else outside the Russian government. This is what so upset the
  imperialists &mdash; the bankers in particular.</p>

  <p>What is this measure, after all?</p>

  <p>Changing the form of currency is not an exceptionally original idea. It has been
  tried any number of times by other governments, especially in the imperialist epoch. If
  it's only a change in the form of the currency, or the form of the indebtedness, it has
  very little significance.</p>

  <p>But in this particular case it is socially as well as politically significant. The
  pre-1993 bank notes run into the millions. If they were held by ordinary Russian
  workers or other citizens, changing the form of the currency would have little
  significance. It would be changing one piece of paper for another. But this currency
  change makes it a condition that all who hold the bank notes must present them for
  change on a certain date &mdash; or they will lose interest on them and suffer in other
  ways.</p>

  <p>It compels all note holders to present themselves to the bank so they can be
  identified. The number of bank notes they hold can be verified.</p>

  <p>Why should this upset the imperialist powers so much?</p>

  <p>Precisely because many of these bank notes, which are transferable, are already in
  the hands of big speculators who have over the years become the new financial
  bourgeoisie in the former USSR. Foreign banks &mdash; of the imperialist powers &mdash;
  also hold a great many of the notes, either as collateral security for loans or in
  escrow. The imperialist banks thus are shielded from taxation on the notes.</p>

  <p>All in all, the measure was calculated to rein in the growing preponderance of the
  imperialist banks and their governments in Russia's internal affairs, including in the
  most delicate matters concerning the Yeltsin government's finances.</p>

  <p>It is the first time the Yeltsin usurpers of the Soviet government have had to take
  a measure that would in any way touch on the interests of the imperialists, and also,
  to a smaller extent, rein in the growing might of the new financial bourgeoisie in the
  former USSR. This grouping rivals the industrialists who have been busy pillaging the
  socialist economy and find themselves in a quandary about what to do with their
  purchases.</p>

  <h4>Stability just a dream</h4>

  <p>Yeltsin and his cohorts may have had a phantasmagoric dream: to make out of the
  wreckage of the USSR a stable capitalist country able to not only exist but to compete
  with other capitalist powers as an independent country.</p>

  <p>But capitalist stability in the former USSR is an illusion. Chaos and economic
  anarchy are the order of the day.</p>

  <p>The flight of rubles into dollars is a continuing threat to the economy that makes
  capitalist stability an elusive objective. The Yeltsinites' original intention was to
  obtain generous loans from the imperialist powers. This was to facilitate the
  development of a stable capitalist system in the USSR.</p>

  <p>But the imperialist powers are less concerned with stability in the development of
  capitalist relations in industry, and especially in finance, than they are in milking
  the country of its vast natural resources: oil, gas, lumber, rare minerals, etc.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin immediately tried to soften the blow of the withdrawal of the old rubles. He
  proposed a complex plan of his own. In his plan, unlike the original, the truly large
  holders of bank notes would be able to redeem them without suffering any kind of
  damage.</p>

  <p>Overall, this initiative by the central bank is important because for the first time
  it gives us a sort of inside look at how the Yeltsin government is dealing with some of
  the most burning issues that actually confront the mass of the workers and
  peasants.</p>

  <h4>Fear of being overturned</h4>

  <p>Every regime of reaction that takes over from a progressive or socialist government
  lives in deadly fear of being overthrown &mdash; precisely because it is the enemy of
  the workers and of the mass of the population generally. It has no real program to
  improve on earlier achievements but can only break down that which was progressive and
  helpful in constructing a stable socialist society.</p>

  <p>The Yeltsin grouping is no different from others that have taken over from an
  overthrown progressive government. Experience in Chile, Nicaragua and elsewhere has
  shown that the new ruling group must either resort to terror or find some way to
  satisfy the needs of the masses. The Yeltsin government has avoided a direct onslaught
  on the living standards of the people. Instead of a frontal attack, it has sought
  roundabout measures. The idea is still to cut the living standard, but by devious ways
  and without an open struggle.</p>

  <p>This latest measure scarcely touches on basic interests of the workers or peasants
  directly. But it is significant for the financial bourgeoisie and for untold numbers of
  the petit bourgeoisie.</p>

  <h4>USSR after WWII</h4>

  <p>In the period right after World War II, the Soviet Union went through a currency
  change. It enabled the USSR to rein in a great many speculators and a growing number of
  bourgeois elements who had profited from shortages and other difficulties. A grouping
  of traders and commercial speculators had been able to profit off the war.</p>

  <p>The currency change at that time forced holders of old rubles to bring them in for
  exchange. They were thereby identified, and the number of rubles they held was known.
  This effectively curbed the then-growing influence of bourgeois elements trading in
  commercial and financial transactions.</p>

  <p>The imperialist bourgeoisie at that time, as reflected in the New York Times,
  howled. But it couldn't do anything about it.</p>

  <p>This time around it holds the financial and economic levers to the prostrate and
  broken former USSR.</p>

  <h4>Role of central bank</h4>

  <p>In the pantheon of capitalist institutions, the most reverential position is held by
  the central bank of any capitalist country. These banks, like the Federal Reserve Bank
  in the U.S., are supposed to be above politics. It should show no inclination toward
  leaning one way or another with respect to political parties or high government
  officials, including prime ministers or presidents.</p>

  <p>Once appointed, the governing group in the central bank is supposed by law to be
  strictly independent of the executive and legislative arms of the capitalist
  government. Of course, they're supposed to report, as does the Federal Reserve Board,
  to Congress and the president. Almost always, the chair of the board is a diehard
  reactionary, as is the case with the current chair, Alan Greenspan. It goes without
  saying that the Democratic-controlled House and Senate quickly approve nominees to the
  board.</p>

  <p>In Russia, the new bourgeoisie, in its ridiculous posture of being truly
  independent, did actually allot wide latitude to the central bank in its normal
  operations.</p>

  <p>As with every central bank in the epoch of imperialist decay and disintegration, the
  Russian bank's main objective is to rein in inflation and hold down the money supply.
  This is what the Russian central bank was trying to do with its bank-note maneuver at
  the end of July. By withdrawing them from circulation it might conceivably &mdash; but
  only conceivably &mdash; lessen inflation, and hold back the growth of the money
  supply.</p>

  <p>But it touched on a raw nerve with the imperialist powers, especially the U.S.</p>

  <p>So while the Yeltsin government initially approved the bank-note withdrawal, under
  the whiplash of U.S. and other banks it made a quick turnaround &mdash; leaving the
  Russian central bank holding the bag. A more sorrowful situation for a truly
  independent central bank can scarcely be conceived.</p>

  <p>Instead of being supported by the government, it was left completely left on its
  own. Yeltsin issued a hocus-pocus decree that was supposed to somewhat modify the
  bank's original intent. In reality, it was just a face-saving measure. It really leaves
  matters essentially where they were before. It will predictably worsen the economic
  situation.</p>

  <p>As the economic situation deteriorates, everything points in one direction. The
  stage is being set for a mighty, independent intervention by the working class in the
  USSR. It, and it alone, is the final arbiter in the struggle to resuscitate the
  revolutionary socialist objectives of the early Soviet government.</p>
