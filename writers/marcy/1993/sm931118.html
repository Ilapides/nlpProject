  <h2>Where capitalist reforms are going</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Nov. 18, 1993)</h5>

  <p>Seldom has a regime been so securely tied to an economic program as is the
  government of Boris Yeltsin in Russia.</p>

  <p>His program is not just a series of isolated innovations or improvisations meant to
  smooth the way for a badly needed economic upturn in an economy that has been stagnant
  or deteriorating. It is qualitatively different.</p>

  <p>It is a momentous transfer of the economic foundations of a workers' state into the
  hands of a new, artificially created bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>History has known all kinds of property transfers. For example, early in capitalism
  the property of poor, small farmers is transferred into the hands of marauding big land
  owners and their military formations. Through an economic process as relentless as it
  is deadly, the bourgeoisie ultimately appropriates the property of the small land
  owners, leaving the population in the most dire poverty. The expropriation of the poor
  lays the basis for the wealth of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>What we have here, however, is an altogether new phenomenon. It is the robbery of
  the collective property of the workers' state by a bourgeoisie that is attempting to
  parcel it out into individual segments. Not since ancient times, when primary communism
  was overthrown in much of the world, has there been any great conversion of collective
  property into its individual component parts. But this is precisely what the
  reactionary Yeltsin camarilla has set as its goal.</p>

  <p>Such a conversion would take years to accomplish &mdash; even if done in a
  systematic and organized manner and assuming political conditions favor it. Above
  everything else, it could only succeed with the complete passivity of the working
  class. But such a situation is utterly inconceivable.</p>

  <h4>Economic decline continues</h4>

  <p>Even the first steps of Yeltsin's program have unleashed a truly catastrophic drop
  in industrial production &mdash; 17 percent in only the first nine months of this year!
  And since the so-called free-market reforms of January 1992 &mdash; almost two years
  ago &mdash; prices have soared: more than 25-fold in 1992, and 20 percent a month since
  June. (Associated Press, Nov. 1)</p>

  <p>Even if these figures somewhat exaggerate the situation, the economic tendency is of
  unquestionable decline.</p>

  <p>The Yeltsinites assume that capitalist, individually owned production is superior to
  socialized production based on ownership by the working class (at least in the
  sociological sense). Yet they must admit that so far it has been a major disaster.</p>

  <p>Had such a decline happened to a socialist country, there would be no end of banner
  headlines here condemning the regime. But the media have downplayed the very serious
  economic crisis in the former USSR that has followed the attempt to bring back
  capitalism.</p>

  <p>One miscalculation by the Yeltsinite pro-capitalist restorationists is that there
  would be a tremendous buyers' market in Russia to fill their treasury with ready cash.
  This has not happened.</p>

  <p>It is only one of many factors working against the successful dismantling of the
  socialist infrastructure. To put the vast industrial, technological and scientific
  infrastructure of Russia up for sale is not only to sail into uncharted seas but also
  tests the financial ability of the population as a whole to act as purchasers. History
  does not provide us with many precedents.</p>

  <p>This explains why Gorbachev took a cautious position when, as the principal leader
  in the Soviet Union, he tried to dispose of the industrial, technological and
  scientific infrastructure. Gorbachev could not come out openly and clearly for
  denationalizing the socialist industries and returning them to private property,
  although Yeltsin pushed him to do so.</p>

  <p>As we have said before, this dismantling is the equivalent of trying to chop up a
  fleet of giant ocean liners in order to try and sell them as small rowboats.</p>

  <p>Incidentally, this explains why the professors from Harvard, Yale and other
  universities &mdash; who in the early days of perestroika figured so prominently as
  cheerleaders of rapidly dismantling the socialist infrastructure &mdash; have lately
  become quite inconspicuous.</p>

  <h4>Clinton, Yeltsin and Siberia</h4>

  <p>What are Yeltsin's prospects? What is he really up to?</p>

  <p>An Oct. 30 New York Times article on Siberia described the region's great natural
  resources and economic infrastructure built up since the October socialist revolution.
  It leads one to wonder: why the sudden interest in Siberia?</p>

  <p>A meeting between Yeltsin and Clinton is projected for early January. Siberia is the
  part of Russia on which the imperialists have cast the most envious eye. In August
  1918, the U.S., Britain, France and Japan formed an anti-Soviet alliance to crush the
  Russian Revolution. Some of their expeditionary forces invaded through Siberia. This of
  course meant they had agreed to take over Siberia and parcel it out among themselves,
  especially its untold riches in natural resources.</p>

  <p>The young workers' republic fought back. After suffering many casualties, the
  imperialist forces were forced to withdraw.</p>

  <p>A most interesting point about the young Bolshevik regime's military victory is that
  its revolutionary, working-class and anti-imperialist propaganda &mdash; skillfully
  executed &mdash; was decisive in forcing the imperialists to retreat.</p>

  <p>The fate of the first workers' republic had hung in the balance. But mass
  working-class, anti-imperialist propaganda had turned the tide &mdash; not superior
  weapons or technology. This historical fact ought to be indelibly impressed on the
  would-be brokers for the Yeltsin administration who appear anxious to sell off the
  riches of Siberia &mdash; the same area that the Red Army fought so valiantly to keep
  in the hands of the workers' republic.</p>

  <p>Hitler's Germany, when it invaded the USSR, was no less anxious to lay its hands on
  the riches of Siberia, but never got there. Siberia again became the focus of world
  attention in the 1960s, when the Soviet government, headed at that time by Premier
  Nikita Khrushchev, raised the possibility of seeking credits, capital and technology
  from Western Europe and Japan for the joint development of Siberia. The imperialists,
  however, wanted not merely to advance credits and loans but to have a permanent stake
  in Siberia.</p>

  <p>There was much discussion on how Siberia could be developed. Would the imperialists
  be able to invest their capital? Would there be loans and credits alone or, as the
  Japanese and other imperialists wanted, would there be joint ventures in which the
  imperialists would have a permanent interest in Siberia? The project collapsed mainly
  because it was believed that the Soviet Politburo at the time was opposed to foreign
  participation.</p>

  <p>The present critical situation in Russia is symbolized by the fact that Yeltsin has
  no avenue for raising money except through loans from Japan, Germany and the U.S. And
  the imperialists are looking at Siberia as collateral security for any loans they may
  advance to Yeltsin after he meets with Clinton in January.</p>

  <h4>Class character and political form of Yeltsin regime</h4>

  <p>The Yeltsin regime is a form of incipient fascism. He has muzzled the press, crushed
  by force and violence the parliamentary opposition and the workers who supported it,
  and imprisoned hundreds if not thousands of progressives of all types &mdash; including
  communists, of course. In early October he closed down 15 newspapers.</p>

  <p>But Yeltsin soon realized that he had bitten off much more than he could chew. As a
  result of pressure from below, he had to rescind his edict on the press and permit most
  of them to publish again &mdash; under conditions, however, which do not allow the
  press to speak openly and clearly.</p>

  <p>Pravda, considered the most widely read newspaper in Russia, proclaimed in its
  headline, "We're back," and "We'll never abandon socialism." But it agreed to certain
  conditions, among them Yeltsin's demand that he choose a new editor and that Pravda
  ease up on attacking the government.</p>

  <p>Whether or not Yeltsin imposes full censorship again or eases up, it is a
  manifestation of the instability of his regime.</p>

  <p>To impose a full-fledged fascist regime, certain other conditions have to prevail.
  Looking at the classical examples of European fascism in Italy, Germany and Spain, it
  seems the Yeltsin camarilla still has far to travel to establish itself as a
  full-fledged fascist government.</p>

  <p>In those countries, fascism came when there was an upturn in the economy &mdash; a
  singularly significant factor in maintaining the durability of the fascist regimes.
  When Hitler took over, the German capitalist economy had plunged to its lowest level
  ever. After several years of a ravaging economic crisis, an upturn was inevitable. No
  sooner had he put his fascist machinery into operation than the economic upturn helped
  Hitler retain his hold on the government and to some extent on the masses. This was due
  especially to his militarization policy as against the pacifism of the Weimar
  Republic.</p>

  <p>In Spain, Franco's bloody suppression of the working class and the peasantry would
  have made him an easy target for overthrow had not an economic upturn been making
  itself felt after years of depression. And the economic situation was also a tremendous
  factor in maintaining Mussolini's stability.</p>

  <h4>Yeltsin can't stabilize regime</h4>

  <p>The situation with the Yeltsin camarilla is the very opposite. Dismantling giant
  industrial and technological enterprises portends not economic growth but, on the
  contrary, further decline. This is his major problem. If he continues with his promised
  orientation of dismantling socialized industry, he will inevitably bring about further
  economic decline.</p>

  <p>His solution is to obtain credits and loans from the imperialist powers, principally
  the U.S. Yet it is entirely questionable whether any of the imperialist governments
  will advance loans and credits unless there is some benefit accruing to themselves.</p>

  <p>It is almost certain the imperialist monopolies will favor a policy of continuous
  rapid dismantling of the socialized infrastructure of Russia. This portends economic
  decline, even if the cash Yeltsin hopes to get from the imperialist powers can help him
  in some projects.</p>

  <p>Overall, there is no way to resuscitate the economy except by a vast program of
  redevelopment.</p>

  <p>If that were in a socialist direction, it would certainly be fruitful. But it's not
  likely to happen on a capitalist basis. There are a great many other areas for capital
  investment and exploitation, especially in Third World countries, where the rate of
  profit would be much higher. The most Yeltsin can expect from the imperialists is
  short-term loans calculated to maintain him in office as a bulwark against the
  working-class and progressive movement &mdash; until the time comes when, in the
  imperialists' calculation, they can exchange him for another neocolonialist leader.</p>

  <h4>What's happening in China</h4>

  <p>Here it is necessary to digress somewhat and bring out the difference between these
  reforms, as they are called, and those in China today.</p>

  <p>Many bourgeois liberals are simply beside themselves in describing the success of
  China's reforms as against the confusion, delay and inefficiency in Russia.</p>

  <p>For many years after the victory of the Chinese Revolution, its greatest problem was
  how to lift the country and the people out of the deepest poverty and devastation,
  augmented by many decades of imperialist domination and civil war.</p>

  <p>In those early days after the Revolution, the problem was how to get the economy
  moving. The government took over bourgeois enterprises, including some of the
  imperialist holdings. The issue was ultimately whether everything should be centralized
  so as to have a uniform plan with which to proceed &mdash; no easy matter considering
  the many problems in such a vast, undeveloped economy &mdash; or to decentralize
  control over the enterprises, both domestic and foreign-controlled. For a period, it
  appeared the debate was merely over how to manage the economy.</p>

  <p>Still, the dispute seemed to center on how to make the historic leap from an
  undeveloped country, devastated by civil war and imperialist invasion, to a developed,
  socialist country.</p>

  <p>But after a succession of inner political struggles on how to proceed, it became
  obvious that one group was concerned with transforming the old Chinese economy into a
  socialist society &mdash; while the other really wanted to disregard, disband, or if
  necessary overthrow the leadership in order to go firmly on the road of building a
  capitalist social structure in China. The long period of internal struggles had wearied
  the workers. After a period of time, they fell into passivity.</p>

  <p>The defeat of the so-called Gang of Four, and in particular the defeat of the
  Cultural Revolution after it had lasted a considerable period of time, laid the basis
  for the victory of the bourgeois entrepreneurial perspective of the Deng Xiaoping
  regime.</p>

  <p>What is now going on in China, therefore, is not just an attempt to reform a social
  structure. It is an attempt to build a capitalist form of society, beginning first of
  all in the coastal areas. The current leaders in China hope that the imperialists will
  continue to invest there and help build up capitalism.</p>

  <p>What will happen in the interior is hard to say. For the time being, the imperialist
  bourgeoisie, whatever their long-term plans to bring this vast land under their
  control, are willing to contribute to China's economic development plans with loans as
  well as technological and scientific aid &mdash; at a price, of course.</p>

  <h4>Capitalist production &mdash; and crisis</h4>

  <p>As in all incipient bourgeois societies, there is a lively, progressive development
  of the productive forces. And if peasants from the interior are not being forced off
  the land and into the cities, as happened in old England, there is enough voluntary
  migration from the interior into the cities to develop a considerable proletariat.</p>

  <p>This capitalist development in China, although limited, is nevertheless real and
  formidable. But it is also China's Achilles' heel. Like all capitalist development, it
  is subject to economic crisis.</p>

  <p>For a number of years the Chinese leaders, at least in their writings and
  publications, seem to have forgotten that capitalist production ultimately leads to
  capitalist overproduction. Under the conditions of a world capitalist crisis China can
  be swept up by it as much as any other capitalist country, regardless of its socialist
  infrastructure.</p>

  <p>Suffice it to say that China's efforts at reform, if they can still be called that,
  are based on expanding capitalist production and making such necessary arrangements
  with the external world as may be necessary or inevitable.</p>

  <p>These reforms are obviously very different from what is going on in the former USSR,
  which had achieved the level of a developed socialist country. The Yeltsin regime is
  not intent at all on developing capitalist production. Certainly not at this stage. The
  entire effort of the bourgeois reforms, particularly beginning with Gorbachev, has been
  to dismantle and cut down the socialist infrastructure built up by the USSR.</p>

  <h4>Siberia as collateral</h4>

  <p>This is where it is at the present moment. A smooth economic road in Russia is
  impossible. First of all, the latent energies of the working class in Russia have not
  yet risen to the surface.</p>

  <p>The imperialist bourgeoisie is moving very cautiously there, as seen by how it
  reacts to Yeltsin's alarmist calls to come to the financial aid of his bankrupt regime.
  The regime badly needs a huge infusion of capital from the foreign imperialists to help
  dismantle the old socialist structure. But this will not bring immediate profits to
  either the imperialists or the home bourgeoisie, except in the consumption sector.</p>

  <p>It is not likely that the U.S., Germany, or any of the other imperialists would be
  willing to undertake a huge long-term extension of funds. They may act in a coordinated
  manner, however, because Russia and its growing economic problems are so vast.</p>

  <p>The Yeltsin administration in turn must give the imperialists not merely promises of
  repayment at high interest rates but collateral security. This unquestionably means
  giving them a substantial permanent interest in the vast riches of Siberia.</p>

  <p>The Canadian author Farley Mowat, an expert on the peoples and ecology of the far
  north and author of the book "The Siberians," was highly impressed by the significant
  socialist development in Siberia, especially as it improved the lives of the native
  peoples. Dismantling all that is a huge problem, not the least of which is that the
  Siberian leaders are opposed to the Yeltsin regime &mdash; not only because he crushed
  the bourgeois opposition but also because of regional considerations.</p>

  <p>They are opting for more decentralization and are raising demands with respect to
  income, budgetary considerations and other economic issues that indicate a centrifugal
  tendency in the next period.</p>

  <p>So no matter how severe Yeltsin's regime is in meting out punishment to his
  temporarily defeated opposition, no matter how much he tries to centralize everything
  in his own hands &mdash; the tendency is toward strengthening centrifugal forces, above
  all in this vital area of Russia.</p>
