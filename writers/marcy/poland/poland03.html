  <h1>Fundamental Causes of the Polish Crisis<br />
  Part 3</h1>

  <p><strong>SEPTEMBER 10, 1980</strong></p>

  <p>Now that the strikes are over and the Polish government has agreed to the demands of
  the workers it is possible to draw some tentative conclusions which flow from the
  unprecedented social and political crisis which has yet to be fully resolved.</p>

  <p>No capitalist government could have agreed to such sweeping demands of the workers
  without the use of threats against the workers and without a show of force.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, the Polish government and the party saw fit to avoid such a
  catastrophic confrontation. There was no use of the police, no mobilization of the
  militia, and no threats to use military force. And, of course, there never was any
  chance for the constantly predicted threat of "Soviet intervention" which the
  imperialist press harped upon.</p>

  <p>Only when it became obvious that the strike was over and the cheering in the
  imperialist camp from Copenhagen to Tokyo began to die down did the <em>New York
  Times</em> on September 10, 1980, reveal that a Polish CP official said "There was no
  worry of Soviet intervention." Further, he said, the possibility of Soviet intervention
  could only come "if Poland abandoned the socialist system or if Poland went out of the
  Warsaw Pact." Neither condition was possible, he added.</p>

  <p>On the matter of the immediate cause of the crisis this party official, alluding to
  the raising of meat prices, noted that the Soviet Union "had advised Warsaw in 1976
  against raising meat prices, implying that the Russians had taken the same line this
  summer [on the meat price rises]." The <em>Times</em> added that "higher meat prices
  touched off protests four years ago and also provoked the recent strikes."</p>

  <p>The <em>Times</em> neglected to restate that it was the utterly incredible demands
  of the Western bankers for austerity and belt-tightening at the Warsaw meeting last
  June which was the principal immediate cause of the strikes.</p>

  <h4>GOVERNMENT NEEDS CONFIDENCE OF WORKERS</h4>

  <p>Both the Polish party and the government, after a period of great vacillation and
  confusion, finally saw fit to grant all of the demands of the workers as the only
  secure exit from the utterly untenable situation in which the government found itself
  and for which it alone, in the final analysis, must bear full responsibility.</p>

  <p>The government granted the sweeping demands only because it is, after all, a
  socialist government. If it is to function with any degree of stability it has to have,
  unlike a capitalist government, not only the support but the confidence of the working
  class.</p>

  <p>This we indicated in an earlier installment. The government and the party had to try
  to win back the confidence of the workers, which it had obviously lost (if it ever had
  much of it in the first place), at almost "any cost" including political concessions of
  a risky character.</p>

  <p>Unquestionably the workers have won wholly justifiable and substantial economic and
  social gains. In the context of present-day Poland, however, it also set back the clock
  of socialism.</p>

  <h4>INDEPENDENT UNIONS</h4>

  <p>The legal validation of the so-called independent unions should not in and of itself
  pose a political challenge to a socialist government. If these unions are truly free
  and independent &mdash; free that is, from bourgeois influence, free of entanglements
  with the Western trade union leaders who act as conduits for imperialist finance
  capital, as well as being free from bureaucratic regimentation-they can within time
  become the firm foundation for a truly socialist government.</p>

  <p>As matters stand, however, what the workers have gained economically and socially is
  at the cost of legitimatizing a bourgeois opposition not merely to the present
  leadership of the government and the party, but to socialism in general.</p>

  <p>This is so despite all the protestations to the contrary by the bourgeois dissidents
  who have now become the staunch allies and mentors of the strike leaders. This is what
  the imperialist bourgeoisie so well recognizes. This is why the press of finance
  capital on a world scale from Copenhagen to Tokyo has cheered the Polish strikers.</p>

  <h4>NEED NOT BE AN OBSTACLE TO SOCIALISM</h4>

  <p>An independent federation of Polish workers which is merely apolitical in character
  or composed of workers whose class consciousness is as yet inadequate for the task of
  socialist construction would not necessarily have to be on a collision course with the
  government. On the contrary, alertness, close contact, and dedication to the cause of
  the workers will facilitate the redress of grievances and the more or less autonomous
  existence of the federation within the framework of the socialist state and will not
  necessarily be a formidable obstacle to socialist construction. It really all depends
  on the degree of socialist consciousness, dedication, and self-sacrifice of the party
  and the state officialdom.</p>

  <p>It is something altogether different if these independent unions orient in the
  direction of a bourgeois political party, whether it be in the form of a labor party or
  a Christian Democratic party. Whatever its name may be, such a development can, of
  course, pose a staggering political problem for the socialist future of Poland. For one
  thing, Poland would then have not only a private (bourgeois) sector in agriculture, but
  one also in industry and this would endanger the very social foundations of the Polish
  People's Republic.</p>

  <p>It is true, of course, that at the time of the strike agreement, the strike leaders
  obligated themselves not to form a political party. But the character of the present
  leadership, its alliance with the Catholic hierarchy and the bourgeois intelligentsia,
  and its strong contacts with the imperialist West, make this obligation by the strike
  leaders of a dubious character. In reality the strike itself has pushed all the
  bourgeois elements forward and they are now springing into life all over the
  country.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the government is far from lacking in options for regaining influence
  among the masses, revitalizing the economy, and turning the political situation around.
  It all depends on the orientation of the leadership from now on.</p>

  <h4>POLAND: A HALF-WAY HOUSE</h4>

  <p>As we have said on many occasions, Poland can only be called a socialist country in
  a very narrow and sociological sense. The basic means of production and limited
  centralized planning are in the hands of the government. To that extent only can the
  government be called socialist.</p>

  <p>Poland, however, is a half-way house. Aside from the small state sector in
  agriculture, capitalist farming prevails throughout Poland. It has been getting steady,
  consistent, and ever-larger infusions of subsidies from the government, that is from
  the hides of the workers. This is true even though it is widely recognized that small
  private farming is inefficient and largely responsible for the poor state of food
  production in Poland.</p>

  <p>Even Secretary of State Edmund Muskie in an interview on CBS's <em>Face the
  Nation</em> on September 7, 1980, said that the farms in Poland, which are 10 acres or
  less, "are inefficient." A friend of agribusiness in this country, Muskie knows that it
  is only the huge farms which can mass produce and employ the most modern technology to
  create an abundant food supply.</p>

  <p>Yet by continuing to subsidize the small plots of privately owned farms, the
  government has not only helped to strengthen bourgeois influence and ideology, it has
  created the basis for the series of food crises in Poland.</p>

  <p>The abandonment of collectivization as a result of the 1956 uprising has widened the
  sphere of bourgeois influence in the economic life of the country far beyond the
  countryside and into the cities where more than 200,000 so-called independent
  entrepreneurs operate on a free enterprise basis and swallow up no meager share of the
  national income.</p>

  <p>All the rebellions beginning with the 1956 uprising up until the present, regardless
  of the legitimate character of the grievances, have led to abandoning socialist forms
  of production in favor of decentralized and market economy (bourgeois) practices.</p>

  <p>(Decentralization in and of itself is not necessarily destructive of socialist
  planning if the decentralization strengthens workers' democracy, cuts down on
  bureaucratic practices, and helps in the execution of an overall socialist plan for the
  nation. Where decentralization is harmful and destructive is where those decentralized
  units become virtually autonomous and even worse, are permitted to deal with the
  foreign imperialist monopolies unilaterally.)</p>

  <h4>OPTIONS FOR GOVERNMENT</h4>

  <p>If so-called free unions now come under the domination of elements hostile to
  socialism, it may very well speed up the ultimate crisis in Poland. In this crisis the
  government will have to choose either to try to reconstruct the economy in accordance
  with the original socialist objectives it was pledged to promote or be pulled
  altogether into the orbit of imperialist finance capital as a result of the chronic
  economic crises which arise from the continual concessions given to the bourgeois
  elements since 1956.</p>

  <p>The admission by the Polish Finance Minister that the government is indebted to the
  Western imperialist banks by more than $20 billion is alarming in itself. But what is
  even more alarming is the government's failure to truthfully explain how such an
  enormous debt could be piled up in such a short time, mostly from the mid-1970s.</p>

  <p>The stock answer from the government is that they were trying to industrialize the
  country too rapidly and invested too much in capital construction. They do not explain,
  of course, why the imperialist banks were so eager to advance such huge sums of money
  to socialist Poland while these very same banks are so vehemently opposed not only to
  advancing money but even to diplomatically recognizing such socialist countries as
  Cuba, Viet Nam, Ethiopia, Kampuchea, Angola, or north Korea.</p>

  <p>True, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia have also been
  advanced loans, but certainly nowhere to the extent of those advanced to Poland.</p>

  <p>Why the almost reckless lending on the part of the imperialists to Poland, more than
  any other socialist country. Is it because it is such an attractive economic prospect?
  Or is it because it is a politically motivated, coordinated endeavor by the imperialist
  banks to strengthen the private, that is, the bourgeois, economic sector in Poland and
  to weaken the nationalized socialist sector by making it excessively dependent on
  exports to the imperialist countries and thereby bring Poland into the imperialist
  orbit altogether?</p>

  <p>After all, is not $20 billion of investment on the part of even the most powerful
  banking syndicates in such a relatively small, industrialized country, which has
  neither oil, uranium, nor natural gas but an abundance of coal and other resources and
  a firm socialist government, an extravagant and speculative venture by the
  imperialists?</p>

  <h4>POLAND'S VULNERABILITY</h4>

  <p>The answer to the question lies in the political motivation of the imperialist
  governments that are controlled by the banks and the military-industrial complex. The
  latter have long seen Poland as the most vulnerable area in the struggle against the
  socialist countries. A "cold" victory against Poland, that is, a victory by the slower
  but nonetheless equally deadly process of economic penetration, could eventually turn
  into a greater victory than one won by imperialist armed intervention.</p>

  <p>The risk, of course, to the imperialists is great. But their method of slow,
  "peaceful" subjugation is nonetheless an irresistible temptation to them. Whether the
  Soviet Union can ever permit imperialist penetration to result in economic and
  political control by the imperialists of its key, fraternal socialist ally on its
  border is another matter.</p>

  <p>It is not the indebtedness as such which is significant or the solicitation of loans
  and credit as a basis for normal trade relations which is significant. The U.S. was for
  many decades a debtor nation and solicited loans and credit from the European capital
  markets for a long time before it became the predominant imperialist power. It was
  never, however, the target of a hostile capitalist world intent on undermining its
  social order, as is the case with the socialist countries, particularly Poland.</p>

  <h4>NEED FOR INVESTIGATION</h4>

  <p>Were there any really progressive elements in the U.S. Senate or House of
  Representatives, where there are endless investigations on matters of urgent
  international significance, they would certainly embark upon an investigation of the
  banks and seek out and expose the real threads which the banks hold in Poland.
  Certainly, in order to advance such tremendous sums of money over such a short period
  of time for no apparent good risk or reason, much bribery had to be advanced
  &amp;agrave; la Lockheed and other scandalous and shady deals.</p>

  <p>A real investigation of the banks and what they were doing in Poland would be most
  revealing. Witness the title of an article in <em>Fortune</em> magazine (September 22,
  1980) on Poland: "What the bankers did to Poland." As a result of the banks' concerns,
  the article says, "Poland has ended up like a less-developed country selling pork
  bellies, ham, potatoes and coal."</p>

  <p>The article was not meant to be an indictment of the banks but rather a boast of
  their accomplishments.</p>

  <h4>INDEPENDENT, SOCIALIST INVESTIGATION</h4>

  <p>It is, of course, even more fitting for the new leadership in Poland to open up a
  real public investigation as to how and why such a big debt was piled up in such a
  short time and who gained by it.</p>

  <p>One of the questions that should be answered is how did it happen that Bank
  Handlowy, Poland's leading international financial institution, replaced its chairman,
  president, and many of its top operating officers in August 1979. Was it, as the
  <em>New York Times</em> of August 14, 1979, claims, to improve its "image in world
  [imperialist] banking circles"? Or was it because they refused to make available
  so-called financial data to Western bankers never previously released? In other words,
  was it because they refused to submit Poland's national budget to the approval of U.S.
  bankers or because they saw the danger of being swallowed by the imperialist banks?</p>

  <p>The banks advanced money for rapid industrialization, but industrialization in and
  of itself does not advance socialism or promote a higher standard of living for the
  masses, as workers in the capitalist countries know very well. The industrialization
  must be based on the concept of socialist construction with the view of meeting the
  most urgent needs of the masses.</p>

  <p>This is not what the bankers advanced the money for. A thorough investigation by a
  truly independent commission including representatives from fraternal socialist
  countries to go into the details of how such vast sums of money could be borrowed,
  extended, and used for what purposes would be a form of enlightenment for all
  concerned.</p>

  <p>It would reveal that the period when these extravagant loans were made is precisely
  the period when the imperialist governments warmed up to the Polish government and
  began to see it, as former President Gerald Ford did, as an independent country."</p>

  <h4>ATTITUDE IN POLAND ON DECLARING DEBT MORATORIUM</h4>

  <p>It is extremely interesting to note the attitude which the Polish government and
  party is taking toward the critical question of declaring a debt moratorium.</p>

  <p>It now turns out that Deputy Prime Minister Henryk Kisiel was specifically asked
  whether any such step was contemplated and replied that the government does not seek a
  moratorium on its debt. In fact, he is quoted as saying that the debts would be paid
  "with the precision of a Swiss watch." (<em>New York Times,</em> September 9,
  1980.)</p>

  <p>However, Zigmunt Szeliga, deputy editor of the Polish weekly <em>Polityki</em> and
  an economist, said, "There is no question of declaring bankruptcy. Poland is a big
  country with big resources and wants to act seriously. " However, he added, "But
  postponing repayment may become the wisest course."</p>

  <p>This signifies that the question of declaring a moratorium and indeed the whole
  question of the indebtedness to the imperialist banks is the pivotal issue in the as
  yet undisclosed struggle between the more progressive, anti-imperialist oriented
  leaders in both the government and the party as against the conciliators.</p>

  <p>The perennial so-called economic reforms since 1956 were in reality a partial
  restructuring of the Polish economy along bourgeois lines. These so-called reforms put
  the socialist sector in ever-greater jeopardy until the banks could finally proclaim,
  as they did as long ago as January 26, 1979, in an astonishing article in the New York
  Times, that the bankers can now control the Polish economy.</p>

  <p>There can be no resolution of the deep-seated crisis which has been wracking the
  Polish economy until the spotlight is turned on the real cause of the crisis.</p>
