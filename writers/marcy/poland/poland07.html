  <h5>Poland: Behind the Crisis [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Class rule and the forms of state</h1>

  <p>JANUARY 5, 1982</p>

  <p>Of all the dramatic and extraordinary developments arising out of the Polish
  struggle, that which has truly stunned if not really staggered the imagination of the
  U.S., and indeed the world, capitalist class was the military takeover in Poland and
  the institution of martial law.</p>

  <p>In particular, the bourgeoisie was struck by how rapidly and effectively the plans
  for the martial law were executed.</p>

  <p>Ever since the strike movement started more than a year ago in Gdansk and other
  cities, it appeared to most bourgeois observers and publicists that, barring a Soviet
  intervention, the so-called democratic processes which had suddenly and so rapidly
  accelerated in Poland would gradually evolve into a full-fledged "democratic" state of
  affairs.</p>

  <p>They had been describing this gradual, "democratic" process for quite a number of
  years before the strike wave. Insofar as its economic and political content, this
  process amounted to instituting reforms that were specifically aimed at reestablishing
  capitalist relations in all spheres of the economic and political life of the
  country.</p>

  <p>Of course, certain real, genuine, and progressive reforms that vitally affected the
  interests of the working class of Poland were urgently needed and long overdue. They
  should have been addressed a long time ago, were it not for a wholly delinquent and in
  many respects corrupt leadership of the Polish government.</p>

  <p>To the extent that these working-class reforms came in the wake of the so-called
  democratic movement, they were of course welcome. Unfortunately, they merely became
  instruments for a movement, and in particular a leadership, which is wholly destructive
  and contradictory to the fundamental historical interests of the working class.</p>

  <p>It is not the first time in history that a reactionary movement has seized upon
  genuine popular grievances in order to foist upon the back of the working class the
  chains of imperialism.</p>

  <h4>BOURGEOISIE BANKED ON PEACEFUL COUNTER-REVOLUTION</h4>

  <p>When future historians peruse the media and press reports of this exciting period in
  Polish history, they will unfailingly see that the world bourgeoisie had banked over a
  long period of time on a peaceful takeover of Poland.</p>

  <p>Every article, every press and media report, every analysis, especially since the
  days of Gdansk and the strike wave, has consistently promoted the line that a peaceful
  evolution of the so-called democratic reform movement was leading in the direction of a
  full-scale restoration of capitalism.</p>

  <p>In fact, the totality of impressions gathered by the world bourgeois press, as well
  as the press from the socialist countries viewed from a different angle, seemed to
  confirm that Poland was now in the hands of bourgeois elements. All that was needed,
  they thought, was to gently but surely close their fist and the restoration of
  capitalism was assured.</p>

  <p>The only fear of the bourgeoisie, and this fear was drummed into the heads of the
  masses day in and day out throughout the world, was that Soviet tanks might roll
  through the streets of Warsaw any day. Otherwise, they felt that there was no real
  obstacle, no force in the entire Polish governmental apparatus, which had the readiness
  or willingness to stop the counter-revolution.</p>

  <p>The imperialist bourgeoisie were greatly encouraged in their happy perspective by a
  phenomenon that had rarely been seen in world history. The leadership of the Polish
  government and its leading authoritative organs who were holding the reins of
  government were so consistently surrendering to every single demand made by the leaders
  of the counterrevolution that the conclusion seemed almost irresistible that Poland
  would fall into the hands of the bourgeoisie like an overripe fruit.</p>

  <p>As each new leadership of the Polish Communist Party faltered and fell, the
  counter-revolutionary elements grew bolder and bolder. Their deliberate destabilization
  of the economy was reaching the point where the entire industrial apparatus would at
  any day come to a shrieking halt.</p>

  <p>And still, the Polish government seemed more intent on further appeasement than any
  effort to halt the imminent collapse of the economy and the resulting capitalist
  restoration.</p>

  <h4>SOLIDARITY OPENLY PLOTTED COUP D'ETAT</h4>

  <p>Finally, the denouement came when the Solidarity leaders decided to publicly come
  out for the abolition of the present form of government.</p>

  <p>"On December 7, 1981," the <em>Washington Post</em> revealed in a front-page story
  on December 8, "the Polish media carried tape-recorded remarks from a closed-door
  meeting last week in Radom of leading [Solidarity] representatives." According to the
  <em>Post,</em> the tapes quoted Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and others as stating
  Solidarity's real goal as being <strong>a takeover of power in Poland.</strong> Union
  officials, clearly upset by the open airing of what they thought were private exchanges
  among 38 regional Solidarity leaders, <strong>did not deny the quoted
  remarks."</strong> (Our emphasis, see appendix C.)</p>

  <p>Less than a week later the leaders of Solidarity deliberately and insolently
  challenged the Polish authorities by proclaiming their intention of taking over the
  government by a coup d'etat, unless the government capitulated, they said, to a
  national referendum, on a date arrogantly set by them and which they would
  administer.</p>

  <p>The <em>New York Times</em> in a dispatch dated December 12, 1981, from Warsaw,
  headlined its front-page story on these developments: "Leaders of union urge Polish
  vote on form of rule. Broad referendum asked. Options would include forming a
  non-communist regime and defining Soviet ties." (<em>New York Times,</em> December 13,
  1981)</p>

  <h4>WEST DIDN'T SAY 'STOP!'</h4>

  <p>It is astonishing that in the light of this open proclamation that a real coup was
  about to unfold, no capitalist statesman in the West said to the Solidarity leaders,
  "Stop! This is dangerous and also illegal. This flouts the constitution of Poland which
  prescribes certain methods for changing the structure of the government."</p>

  <p>The bald truth is that when all this was openly declared by the Solidarity leaders,
  and none &mdash; we repeat none &mdash; bothered to even deny that this was their aim
  no U.S. State Department official made any warnings to Solidarity not to go too
  far.</p>

  <p>They might have &mdash; if they had known what was coming next.</p>

  <p>The capitalist media, especially in the U.S. where the media boast of their
  much-vaunted independence and seemingly adversarial relation to the capitalist state,
  decided, as though by unanimous secret decision, not even to editorialize on this
  impending momentous development &mdash; a projected coup openly and brazenly proclaimed
  and undenied in a country considered of key and cardinal importance to Western
  imperialism.</p>

  <p>How this development went by the board, as though it were one of a multitude of
  incidents which did not add up to a qualitative change, must of course be left to the
  historians of the future.</p>

  <h4>COMPLETE SURPRISE</h4>

  <p>The fact of the matter is that the army takeover and the institution of martial law
  came as a complete surprise to the imperialist bourgeoisie. It was a miscalculation of
  truly historic dimension.</p>

  <p>It must also have come as a humiliating embarrassment to all the imperialist organs
  of suppression and subversion, both overt and covert, which have long been at work in
  Poland, as they are in many countries throughout the world.</p>

  <p>It cannot be denied that the various U.S. intelligence agencies and the diplomatic
  corps, the CIA and its thousands of operatives in both overt and covert operations,
  including the new crop of top U.S. businessmen acting as CIA agents, had a
  superabundance of information and conduits regarding the Polish situation. But even for
  them, the army takeover was a complete surprise.</p>

  <h4>WHY NO OUTCRY OVER 'FAILURE OF INTELLIGENCE'?</h4>

  <p>Unlike other surprises for U.S. imperialism, such as in Iran, Cuba, and other
  countries, there was no outcry in the U.S. press about the "failure of intelligence."
  It would scarcely be possible to do so when they had such an abundance of information
  and had made such deep inroads.</p>

  <p>When the capitalist establishment puts the onus of its disasters on a so-called
  failure of intelligence, it inevitably opens up acrimonious debate within the ruling
  class. Its only merit is that it shields the president from blame and puts the onus of
  responsibility on a few of the more or less minor officials in the spy establishment
  and more frequently the State Department.</p>

  <p>For the capitalist establishment as a whole it has the "redeeming value" of
  ultimately strengthening the overblown, secret covert operations apparatus. And demands
  are inevitably made for larger and larger appropriations for the military as well.</p>

  <p>This occurred, for instance, just after the "rescue operation" in Iran when the Air
  Force skillfully manipulated the capitalist press in general, and the politicians in
  particular, to go along with increased military spending to strengthen the Air Force
  and the military forces in general.</p>

  <p>Each new imperialist disaster of necessity creates the basis not for a reversal of
  policy, but for digging in deeper.</p>

  <h4>CALCULATIONS BASED ON FALSE ASSUMPTION</h4>

  <p>None in the capitalist establishment, even at this late date, venture to say that
  they had a premonition of coming events nor that they knew the military would
  intervene. Certainly some of this would have surfaced in the capitalist press as a
  result of a leak here or there.</p>

  <p>Their calculations, however, were based strictly on the false assumption that the
  Polish military would intervene only on the side of the counter-revolution. And this
  would have occurred, they thought, only if the Soviet Union moved in.</p>

  <p>That, however, is not what happened. The army moved in not on the side of the
  counter-revolution, but in an effort to repulse it if not to crush it altogether.</p>

  <p>The outcome of the struggle is by no means certain at this date. The
  counter-revolution has been repulsed and silenced and in part suppressed. The struggle,
  however, is by no means over. There are formidable forces available to the
  counter-revolution internally. And the external forces of imperialism while currently
  in a state of shock and confusion are more than likely to regroup and resume the
  offensive.</p>

  <h4>SURPRISE FACTOR</h4>

  <p>The factor of surprise is very important and should not be underestimated. The U.S.
  intelligence services were left unaware notwithstanding their vast accumulation of
  knowledge of the Polish economy, personnel, and various governmental and party leaders.
  But not, apparently, of the army itself.</p>

  <p>Certainly they knew the top command of the army. This was indicated by the
  historical sketches of the army that appeared in the press both before and after the
  institution of martial law.</p>

  <p>Knowing all this, however, and even having intimate knowledge of the personal
  histories of the commanding staff of the army does not in and of itself assure a
  correct estimate of the army's role in such a monumental historical struggle, in which
  the destiny of Poland literally hangs in the balance.</p>

  <p>It is also of considerable significance that the Polish Army was able to plan the
  takeover and the institution of martial law with exceptional skill and effectiveness,
  as attested to by the imperialist press.</p>

  <p>It is thus with considerable pride and a dash of scorn that the Polish government
  released on January 3, 1982 through the Polish news agency PAP, a commentary which, as
  they put it, quotes political analyst Jerzy Muszynski.</p>

  <p>Of course, it represents the view of the Polish military. But to soften the blow to
  U.S. imperialism it is put in the form of a commentary by a political analyst. Not all
  of the article is available to us at this time. Portions of it are reprinted in the
  January 4 edition of the <em>New York Times,</em> from which these extracts are taken.
  It is worth quoting at some length.</p>

  <h4>COMMENTARY A REVERSAL OF ATTITUDE TO U.S.</h4>

  <p>The language used in this commentary has not been heard in Poland for many years. It
  represents a sharp reversal of the former servile attitude to U.S. capitalism and the
  fear of antagonizing it. Even during the Watergate days, the Polish press played
  Watergate almost completely low-key, while elsewhere, even in the capitalist world, it
  was front-page news. Whatever view was taken of Watergate, it added to discrediting the
  U.S. capitalist system.</p>

  <p>One of the officials of the current government even alluded to the fact that the
  rebellions and demonstrations in the U.S. in the 1960s were also very much played down
  by the Polish press out of consideration for maintaining good relations with
  Washington.</p>

  <p>The January 4 1982 commentary however is fundamentally different from previous
  Polish news broadcasts.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"The world public as a whole," it begins, "including that which is friendly
    towards Poland and that which never had sympathy for the rule of the working masses
    received with anxiety the sharp turn in U.S. policy towards Poland, and especially
    the personal involvement of President Reagan against the legal authorities of the
    Polish People's Republic."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is the first open attack on Reagan in the Polish press after months and months
  of ambivalence, accommodation, and downright servility.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"The fact that Reagan preferred instability to prevail anarchic tendencies to
    spread and conflicts between the authorities and anti-socialist forces to grow in
    Poland cannot surprise anybody. His exaggerated interest in the internal affairs of
    Poland also could not be a surprise while the extremist activists of Solidarity and
    other anti-socialist groups made preparations for taking over power in Poland and
    sought ways of achieving counter-revolutionary changes in the system."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h4>REAGAN IS 'A FERVENT ANTI-COMMUNIST'</h4>

  <p>Reagan is then attacked in no uncertain terms.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Reagan supported those people and their activities, as he is a fervent
    anti-communist. With all his heart he would like to see the success in overthrowing
    the socialist system anywhere. Such a chance the American President and other
    opponents of socialism saw in Poland."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Finally comes the punch line, which cannot but sting Reagan, the military, and
  especially the intelligence services.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Then, all of a sudden, General Jaruzelski established the Martial Council of
    National Salvation, and the Council of State of the Polish People's Republic decreed
    martial law to cover all of the country. By this decree the independent trade union
    Solidarity and other social organizations that were to create the political
    infrastructure of this new deal in Poland have been suspended. The socialist army
    took control of various fields of public life and <strong>all of that without consent
    or even knowledge of the American President.</strong> (Our emphasis.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Thus, after months of wavering, indecision, downright capitulation and groveling at
  the feet of U.S. imperialism by the former Polish leaders, this must come as a blow to
  the solar plexus of Reagan and his military and secret service camarilla.</p>

  <h4>'MAIN AUTHOR OF SECOND COLD WAR'</h4>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"History is bound to duly appraise all Reagan moves. Already now it is obvious,
    however, that Reagan is not going to join the pantheon of great American statesmen,
    though many are surprised by his manner of ruling. Undoubtedly he will go down in
    history as the main author of what could be termed the second cold war, the one that
    threatens mankind with anxiety for the future and concern over the prospects for
    peaceful coexistence of states with different socioeconomic and political
    systems.</p>

    <p>"If Reagan continues to pursue this course, the progressive part of world opinion
    will again, like in the 1940s and 1950s, consider the United States the main
    instigator of warfare, the leading bastion of contemporary imperialism and the
    spokesman for international destabilization."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A reading of this analysis reveals that to the extent that the Reaganites and their
  imperialist allies depended upon the Polish Army to stand by while the
  counter-revolution was slowly but surely seizing the entire social system and almost
  reaching the point of executing a coup d'etat, their hopes were wholly erroneous.</p>

  <p>As we said, the bourgeoisie miscalculated. It was a howling, truly astonishing
  blunder.</p>

  <p>We hope to go into a detailed examination in explaining this. It is one thing when
  an individual, even if he or she represents a class, makes an erroneous individual
  evaluation. It is something else when the representatives of a whole class, the
  representatives of world imperialism collectively, make this same error. This is a
  unique situation and requires explanation.</p>

  <h4>SHARPENS ANTAGONISMS WITH IMPERIALIST ALLIES</h4>

  <p>It should also be noted that the military takeover has put the Reaganites on the
  horns of an acute dilemma. Their policy has resulted in opening wider than ever the
  split between the U.S. and its imperialist allies.</p>

  <p>Don't think for a minute that the European imperialists are any less unhappy than
  the U. S, ruling class about the military takeover. They both wish that it hadn't
  happened.</p>

  <p>What the military takeover has meant for the Reaganites is a greater sharpening of
  the antagonisms between the U.S. and its NATO collaborators.</p>

  <p>Both the U.S. and its imperialist allies have a common objective in Poland &mdash;
  to turn it back to capitalism. But the Europeans are understandably more fearful of the
  situation exploding into a military conflagration near or even on their territory. They
  know that the U.S. would be fully content for a good while, just like during the Second
  World War, to watch from a safe distance and utilize the bloody opportunity to get a
  better and stronger grip on the Western imperialist allies so as to completely
  subjugate them and use them as a grouping of satellites in the struggle against the
  Soviet Union.</p>

  <h4>WORLD PUBLIC OPINION IN CONSTERNATION</h4>

  <p>The military administration of the Polish state has also thrown vast sections of
  world public opinion into consternation.</p>

  <p>The anti-communist left, which in any case has been full of the most bitter
  hostility not merely to the Soviet Union but to communism and revolutionary socialism
  in general, is full of praise for Solidarity. They are not one whit embarrassed to be
  found in the company of Wall Street, Lombard Street, the Bourse, and the Vatican in one
  great united front to "save freedom."</p>

  <p>There is also, of course, very serious apprehension and confusion among truly
  progressive elements of world public opinion which should and must be addressed. To do
  so properly, however, it is necessary to deal with the Polish crisis in the context of
  the present global struggle.</p>

  <p>Just as important, it is necessary to go back to the historical roots of the
  struggle and to analyze once again each and every phase of the struggle as it has
  unfolded over many decades.</p>

  <p>To do this it is necessary to draw on the arsenal of revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist
  doctrine and methodology as our guide in illuminating some aspects of the great drama
  that is unfolding on Polish soil, which have been darkened if not obliterated from
  contemporary view by imperialist propaganda. These aspects have had and will continue
  to have repercussions of a worldwide significance.</p>
