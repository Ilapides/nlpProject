  <h5>Poland: Behind the Crisis [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>U.S. imperialism's economic policy toward the socialist countries</h1>

  <p><strong>OCTOBER 9, 1979</strong></p>

  <p>At a time of rising international tensions, instigated by a new round of U.S.
  aggressive moves in the international arena, particularly in the Caribbean, it is most
  important to pay the closest attention to the complicated array of military and
  diplomatic moves which the Carter administration has set in motion under the pretext of
  responding to an alleged "Soviet combat brigade" in Cuba.</p>

  <p>It is the overall <strong>political</strong> struggle between imperialism, together
  with its motley crew of allies, clients, and puppets on the one hand, and the socialist
  countries, the world proletariat, and the oppressed peoples on the other which will
  ultimately determine the fate of decadent monopoly capitalism.</p>

  <p>Precisely because the struggle has been of such long duration and its nature is of
  such an all-encompassing character, it is important that certain other aspects of the
  struggle not be overlooked in the course of acute political, diplomatic, and military
  encounters.</p>

  <p>Such, for instance, is the economic policy of world finance capital in relation to
  the socialist countries. It is very well known, of course, that the imperialist powers
  have for many decades employed economic sabotage, blockade, and attempts at
  strangulation against all the socialist countries. It is equally well known that the
  socialist countries, virtually without exception, have attempted to normalize relations
  with the imperialist powers and have sought out all avenues to develop trade, commerce,
  and general economic intercourse with a view towards strengthening socialist
  construction.</p>

  <p>What is not so well known and what has not been given adequate attention are the
  varied methods and devices of imperialism to undermine socialist construction. Open
  economic warfare, of course, has been one method. Economic subversion and sabotage,
  another.</p>

  <h4>IMPERIALISM'S OTHER CHANNEL FOR PENETRATION</h4>

  <p>These have more or less been exposed over the many years of the struggle. There
  remains, however, the area which in contemporary economic literature goes under the
  name of "trade and commerce for mutual benefit based on cooperation." This is very
  important. It covers a multitude of processes which on the one hand have held out hope
  for the socialist countries and on the other hand have formed the basis for the
  penetration of finance capital into the more vulnerable socialist countries.</p>

  <p>Marxists are not economic determinists. Marxists take their initial starting point
  from the anatomy of the class structure which governs a given society. Marxism teaches
  that while the basis for the exploitation of the masses lies in the search for
  super-profits by the ruling monopolies, economic and financial gain lie at the root of
  the constant chase for profits. If finance capital can penetrate the economies of the
  socialist countries on a more or less agreed upon basis, it will pursue its goal as
  feverishly as it has done throughout the history of imperialism. In underdeveloped
  countries.</p>

  <h4>POLITICAL REACTION BOUND TO FOLLOW</h4>

  <p>These economic processes of finance capital, which are developed slowly, are often
  given less attention than they deserve, but they are nonetheless extremely deadly if
  permitted to run their course. Of course, at a certain stage of development in this
  process of capital penetration, this or that socialist country will be confronted with
  a formidable <strong>political</strong> development which in turn can threaten the very
  fabric of the nascent socialist order.</p>

  <p>It is precisely this eventuality which must be given more attention. Thus far only
  the capitalist press has carried endless columns in the economic sections of its
  newspapers which boast of the inroads they have made in some of the socialist
  countries.</p>

  <p>These inroads are not confined to Yugoslavia or Poland but reach also into other
  socialist countries. At this historical conjuncture when the Peoples Republic of China
  (PRC) has virtually become diplomatically and militarily allied with imperialism, it is
  important to examine its economic relations with the latter. China's immense role in
  the world dictates this.</p>

  <p>While its military and diplomatic relations, such as they are with imperialism, are
  of course key to any political attitude to the PRC, in the long run it is the economic
  relationship with imperialism which may ultimately decide whether or not China will
  survive as a socialist country and regain its stature in the socialist community or
  become integrated into the capitalist orbit as the bankers and generals have long been
  planning.</p>

  <p>It would be easier for the PRC leaders to break a diplomatic alliance with the
  Western powers and Japan than it would be to reverse long-standing economic integration
  with the economic structure of world finance capital.</p>

  <p>When the Soviet Union in 1939 effectuated the Stalin-Hitler Non-Aggression Pact and
  made an alliance between the USSR and Germany, whatever its merits from the point of
  view of gaining time against Hitler (while at the same time disorienting the world
  working class), there was one facet of it which stood out rather clearly in spite of
  all the confusion it caused. There was no element of economic dependence and no aspect
  of economic integration on the part of the USSR with Germany. The non-aggression pact
  was preceded by a trade agreement, but it did not assume the dimensions of a far-flung
  plan for economic integration.</p>

  <p>Similarly, Japan's agreement with Nazi Germany was purely of a military and
  diplomatic character and merely amounted to parallel plans to divest the Allied
  imperialist powers of their colonial booty in Asia and in Europe.</p>

  <h4>CHINA'S ECONOMY AN IMPERIALIST TARGET</h4>

  <p>The situation between the PRC and Western imperialism as well as Japan at the
  present time is altogether different. The aim of imperialism is not merely a military
  and diplomatic alliance against the USSR, which they still fear that China may at any
  moment reverse. The more fundamental aim is of a long-range character. It is to bring
  China, an economically and industrially undeveloped colossus, solidly into the orbit of
  imperialism.</p>

  <p>Many steps have already been taken over the years by the PRC leadership in that
  direction. The trade relations, in and of themselves, do not constitute the fundamental
  linchpin which would make for unbreakable economic links. It has been many years now
  since the PRC abandoned Soviet Aeroflot engines for U.S. aircraft. It was the
  reactionary senator from Boeing, Senator Jackson, who first saw the significance of
  this move.</p>

  <p>Following this rather unheralded move, China over the years has steadily leaned in
  the direction of banking its future on Western trade, commerce, and technology. This
  was true to some extent even during the Cultural Revolution.</p>

  <p>Rolls Royce engines from Britain or DC-10 engines from the U.S. in and of themselves
  may seem to be small potatoes when one considers the vastness of world capitalist trade
  and technology. But given their strategic significance in the framework of the
  contemporary period they can create considerable dependence on the West, especially if
  the trend continues for a number of years, as it has.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note that in the growing challenge from Western Europe and Japan to
  U.S. economic domination in other fields, the U.S. has retained overwhelming control in
  this strategic field, in the vital aircraft industry in the imperialist world. The
  recent collapse as a challenge to the U.S. of the British-French Concorde project, the
  largest technological undertaking in Western Europe, and the announcement that the
  Boeing Company and All-Nippon, Japan's largest domestic airline, have agreed on the
  purchase of up to 40 of Boeing's new 767 aircraft at a value of $1.5 billion,
  underscore the dominance of the U.S. in the aircraft industry. This leaves China little
  room to maneuver elsewhere for strategic aircraft.</p>

  <p>Vital as China's shift years ago from the Soviet to the U.S. side in the aircraft
  field was, it is merely one instance of the shift in the economic orientation to the
  West. This shift is vastly overshadowed by far more significant moves which China is
  embarking upon in the broader economic and financial field. These foreign policy shifts
  are intimately related to the vast reforms in the economic structure of China which are
  of a wholly regressive character, notwithstanding a progressive development here and
  there.</p>

  <h4>CHINA READY TO JOIN WORLD BANK</h4>

  <p>For instance, on September 28, 1979, Deputy Premier Gu Mu said that the PRC is ready
  to join the World Bank, also known as the International Bank for Reconstruction and
  Development, which is technically a part of the United Nations organization.</p>

  <p>It is in the interest of any socialist country to seek out and apply for membership
  in any number of international organizations where this can be useful and helpful in
  promoting the cause of socialist construction and the welfare of its people. There are
  literally dozens of world organizations which range all the way from meteorology to
  oceanography, world health, communications, and so on, where there are advantages not
  merely in exchanging information but also in acquiring know-how and technical
  expertise, aside from broadening contacts with the rest of the world.</p>

  <p>The purpose of socialist construction in any country is not to hermetically seal
  itself within its own boundaries, but to expand economic, political, and cultural
  relations, always with the view of retaining sovereignty and independence from
  imperialism.</p>

  <p>It is otherwise, however, with notorious organizations such as the World Bank, which
  is an instrument of imperialist domination and subjection. One merely has to look
  through the old issues of the Beijing Review for some of the most enlightened
  documentation on this score.</p>

  <h4>THE WEST WANTS AN 'OPEN DOOR' POLICY</h4>

  <p>The <em>New York Times</em> of September 28, in its story on China's announcement
  that the PRC will file a formal application to join the organization, correctly
  headlined its story, "China set to join West's loan units." There could scarcely be any
  doubt that it is indeed a Western device to economically subjugate the loan applicants
  and tie them to the chariot wheels of Wall Street, Lombard Street, the Bourse, and the
  Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>

  <p>The <em>Times</em> characterized China's move as "a major step in Chinese policy
  toward both full Western economic citizenship and greater openness." Just what does
  this greater "openness" mean? It means compliance with the infamous disclosure
  requirements for all loan applicants. It means not only to give your life history but
  an unambiguous declaration of intents and purposes for which the loans are
  required.</p>

  <p>Deputy Premier Gu assures us that the application shows that "so long as it does not
  affect China's sovereign rights and the terms are appropriate, we are ready to accept
  credits and loans from all friendly countries and financial groups." But this is
  precisely the point. It does infringe, it does affect China's sovereignty. The terms
  are not appropriate. And the countries are not at all friendly but as antagonistic as
  ever and only mean to use China as a wedge against other socialist countries and to
  bring it into the imperialist fold. This has been one of the causes of the bitter
  conflict between Mao and his followers and the Deng-Hua grouping which is now at the
  helm.</p>

  <h4>MAO TRIED TO AVOID DEPENDENCE</h4>

  <p>From its earliest days the Chinese leadership under Mao tried to avoid any sort of
  dependence upon imperialism, particularly in the light of the long history of China's
  oppression and exploitation at the hands of the colonialist imperialists. Getting loans
  and credits from the imperialists was not on its agenda. It had little choice, in the
  light of the announced policy of U.S. imperialism not only to isolate but to contain
  China and ultimately to virtually engage in an open war as a result of U.S. aggression
  in Korea and the friendly assistance that the PRC gave to the Koreans during the
  war.</p>

  <p>It is also true, however, that during the course of this long struggle with
  imperialism, the Chinese leadership went to the other extreme in making it more or less
  a dogmatic article of faith not to participate in any of the economic or financial
  undertakings of the imperialist powers which would involve loans and credit, even if it
  were on terms that were truly acceptable and appropriate to a revolutionary socialist
  government.</p>

  <h4>LENIN'S POLICY</h4>

  <p>The Bolsheviks, under Lenin, also had declared their intention of seeking loans and
  credits and even, as Lenin later said, allowing "the most powerful imperialist
  monopolies" &mdash; Lenin's word &mdash; concessions in the USSR under the vigilant
  eyes of the Bolshevik government. The imperialists turned down the terms demanded by
  the Soviet government.</p>

  <p>It is not inconceivable, however, as subsequent history of the USSR shows, that
  loans and credits to a growing socialist country from the imperialist powers could turn
  out to be of considerable material assistance, if the leadership of the socialist
  country can hold the imperialist wolf at bay in this area of conflict, which is merely
  another form of the struggle between imperialism and the socialist countries.</p>

  <p>But whereas the Chinese leadership under Mao had gone too far in eschewing any kind
  of broad loan or credit agreements with the imperialists, born mostly out of fears that
  these would impinge upon the sovereignty and independence of the country, this new
  reactionary grouping which is in power now has gone all the way to the other extreme
  and virtually opened the floodgates to imperialist penetration.</p>

  <p>Like Beijing's attempt at accommodation with the European Economic Community (EEC)
  the move to gain membership in the World Bank, should it become consummated, means, in
  the words of the Times, "full Western economic citizenship," which is another way of
  saying economic integration into the imperialist orbit. When an admittedly weak,
  underdeveloped socialist country becomes fully integrated into the economic orbit of
  imperialism, what does it signify? It signifies the subordination of the nascent
  socialist economy &mdash; of the dictatorship of the proletariat, as the PRC would say
  &mdash; to the dictatorship of the imperialist bourgeoisie. Should all this happen,
  could the result be any different?</p>

  <p>Such a sweeping move could not possibly be contemplated by the Chinese leadership,
  were it not for the reactionary reforms at home which the Beijing regime has been
  carrying through under the guise of eliminating excesses of the Cultural
  Revolution.</p>

  <h4>NEW CHINESE LEADERS REVIVE CAPITALIST ELEMENTS</h4>

  <p>While one need not go to the lengths of exaggerating the sharp turn to the right, as
  do John Fraser of the <em>Toronto Globe and Mail</em> or Fox Butterfield of the <em>New
  York Times</em> in describing the virtual free rein that the government has given to
  the collectives in agriculture and small industry, it is nevertheless clear that what
  the new leadership is doing is reviving long-dormant capitalist elements in the
  economic life of China.</p>

  <p>Of course, where excesses have taken place and where industry and agriculture have
  declined, forced concessions to private initiative may be necessary. This has long been
  understood ever since Lenin's New Economic Policy. But what is taking place in China is
  the wholesale dismantling of incipient socialist projects both in agriculture and
  industry in favor of bourgeois enterprises.</p>

  <p>"Collectively owned shops and trades," says John Fraser in his article which is also
  syndicated in the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> of September 17, 1979, "are now
  being given an extraordinary amount of encouragement from the government." This may be
  wholly necessary and effective, if it is indeed oriented towards strengthening the
  socialist economy and eventually converting the collectives &mdash; which are
  semi-bourgeois &mdash; into full-fledged socialist property wholly run by the state.
  Collectives are in reality a form of group ownership in which the state merely retains
  a certain percentage of the profit and where state control may be only nominal.</p>

  <p>It is worth noting, however, that Fraser, who has been in China for a considerable
  time, sees in the bourgeois degeneration of the collectives "the emergence of free
  enterprise in China" and ventures to predict that such a development "may turn out to
  be one of the landmark events of our time." In a word, a full-scale
  counterrevolution.</p>

  <h4>STILL IN PROCESS</h4>

  <p>There are many who believe that such a development has already taken place. In our
  view, the judgment is wholly premature and not warranted by the facts. The headlong
  shift to the right is most obvious in the diplomatic and military fields. That's where
  the greatest danger lies and the most attention must of course be given. The more
  ominous aspects, however, in the long run lie in the slower, quieter economic
  processes, both domestically as well as in the world arena.</p>

  <p>But it is still only a process. It can be overtaken by political developments either
  at home or abroad.</p>

  <p>There is still danger of falling into the abyss as well as the opportunity to
  reverse the process. Unquestionably the intervention of the Chinese workers and
  peasants on a revolutionary scale would be the most potent answer to the reactionary
  ruling group at home and to the imperialists abroad.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the current state of affairs between China and the Soviet Union, and
  not for a moment forgetting the possibility of another attack by China against Viet
  Nam, it is important to bear in mind that in its fundamental aspects the economic
  policy of world finance capital in general and American finance capital in particular
  has in substance the same objective in China as it does in all of the socialist
  countries.</p>

  <p>The form of it may differ but in essence it's the same. The multi-national
  corporations and giant banking combines which the U.S. government serves, have
  specialized approaches to each of the socialist countries.</p>

  <p>In the very midst of the hysteria which the Carter administration fomented against
  the USSR over the phony issue of Soviet "combat troops" in Cuba, the U.S. government
  announced that it is ready to sell the USSR up to 25 million tons of grain, 10 million
  more than the Soviet Union bought in the crop year just ended. This is seven million
  tons more than the purchases in 1972 under Nixon over which such a big hullabaloo was
  raised, claiming that the wheat deal and not the general inflationary trend sent
  domestic bread prices soaring.</p>

  <p>Presumably the wheat offering was a conciliatory move by the Carter administration.
  In reality it was nothing of the kind. The fact of the matter is that this year the
  U.S. had a surprisingly big bumper crop. Coming at a time of recession or
  near-recession, the bumper crop was a manifestation of capitalist over-production and
  the huge grain corporations would be at total loss as to how to dispose of the surplus.
  The USSR is one of the few customers which can be relied upon to pay promptly. In other
  circumstances the U.S. might be forced to dump the grain into the ocean or burn it.
  Making it available to the USSR at a price is a lesser evil.</p>

  <p>By contrast, however, the hostile character of Carter's diplomacy in this period was
  vividly demonstrated when the U.S. government's International Trade Commission suddenly
  ruled that imports of anhydrous ammonia from the Soviet Union were taking away business
  from U.S. producers. The ITC recommended to Carter that he impose duties or some
  combination of penalties to stop the USSR from "dumping" its ammonia products on the
  U.S. market. It goes without saying that it was 13 big U.S. chemical producers and
  distributors who sparked the move and found a ready ear not only in the Carter
  administration but in Congress.</p>

  <p>Ammonia is one of the few manufactured products for which the USSR is able to gain a
  market in this country, but this has continually been undermined by both economic and
  political pressures in the U.S. The economic and political pressures come from
  factional groups having a competitive interest against the USSR and from a broad
  bourgeois political opposition mounting a constant anti-Soviet campaign which increases
  during periods of high tension between the Soviet Union and the U.S.</p>

  <h4>TRADE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST USSR</h4>

  <p>The USSR, in spite of its more than 60 years of existence, has not been able to have
  its relationship with the U.S. normalized to the extent where it can be treated equally
  along with other countries with respect to tariffs and import and export controls. The
  ban against trade with the USSR still exists in the form of the so-called "most favored
  nations" clause, which permits discrimination against Soviet products and trade in
  general.</p>

  <p>In selling grain to the USSR, the U.S. relieves itself of a renewable resource, so
  to speak, and in return gets hard cash which the Soviet Union has to purchase with its
  gold stock, which is not a renewable resource. It is not trade on an equal basis.</p>

  <p>The sale of technology to the USSR is mostly forbidden, not on economic grounds but
  on political grounds, and is aimed to undermine the USSR, both economically and
  politically. Nevertheless, the USSR has been able to obtain large credits from Western
  imperialist banks. The credit, however, has been on the basis of having maintained an
  impeccable record of payments on time. This is unquestionably due to the economic
  strength and viability of the USSR as well as to its tremendous resources such as gold,
  oil, and others &mdash; but even more so to its ability to take credit on wholly
  acceptable terms for a socialist country.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the economic warfare against the USSR continues as part and parcel of
  the overall broad political struggle. The hopes of imperialism of using trade and
  economic intercourse as a means of reviving bourgeois trends among the economic and
  technical intelligentsia in the USSR and thus cultivating a broad grouping of
  "liberalizers" of the economy have faltered, and if recent literature in the Western
  press is any indication, their hopes of such a prospect have become rather dim.</p>

  <p>The same, however, cannot be said of the East European socialist countries. To each
  of these the U.S. has a specialized, particular approach.</p>

  <h4>WORLD BANK MEETS IN YUGOSLAVIA</h4>

  <p>Recently Belgrade became the site of a world conference of the International
  Monetary Fund and World Bank. It was deliberately chosen by the bankers to underscore
  that Yugoslavia can scarcely be called a socialist country. It was a symbolic gesture
  and even a defiant one to the USSR and other socialist countries. There was little that
  the Yugoslavs could do but to haul out the welcome mat.</p>

  <p>What the Yugoslav leaders are most of all interested in is to persuade the leading
  bankers to refinance the staggering sum of $600 million of indebtedness that is coming
  due and which the Yugoslav officials are at a loss on how to meet. For the refinancing
  of the $600 million debt to be successful, it would mean that Yugoslavia must have
  renegotiated over the last four months debts of more than a billion dollars. The
  interest on such debts is staggering when one considers that the total indebtedness to
  the bankers amounts to $13 billion.</p>

  <p>The need to renegotiate the debts signifies that the Yugoslav leaders have been
  unable to meet their indebtedness on time and are on the verge of defaulting unless the
  bankers agree to extend the terms of the debt &mdash; for a generous fee, of course.
  Thus Yugoslavia's debt service "will rise from $1.8 billion this year to $2.9 billion
  before dropping off after 1982 more than 22% of the country's projected total hard
  currency earnings." (<em>New York Times,</em> September 24, 1979, page D1.)</p>

  <p>This aptly sums up 30 years of the Titoist way of building socialism, of the meaning
  and significance of the Yugoslav so-called "self-management economy" and of the real
  worth of the participation of the "workers' councils" in the "innovative" economic
  structure of Yugoslavia.</p>

  <h4>LOANS GEARED TO CAPITALIST MARKET</h4>

  <p>What was the indebtedness mostly for? Of course, there are many construction
  projects which are valid and appropriate. But in extending loans for industrial
  projects the bankers do so after approving what they consider the need for such
  projects and the potential for the Western markets. In the Yugoslav case, at least so
  far as current development goes, the marketable products from many of the projects in
  Yugoslavia are not at all salable in the light of the economic crisis in the capitalist
  countries.</p>

  <p>First the bankers insist, before lending money, that the construction of a certain
  installation or industrial project fit in with <strong>their</strong> overall
  conception of its desirability in the world capitalist economy. They then proceed to
  lend the money, sometimes in installments, with a view toward market conditions in the
  capitalist West.</p>

  <p>Of course, over a period of many years, some of the money lent and credit extended
  are for genuine and sorely needed industrial and agricultural improvement. But the
  pattern that has emerged over the years &mdash; and it is now 30 years &mdash; clearly
  indicates that the integration of Yugoslavia into the capitalist orbit of imperialist
  finance and economics has grown far more than the socialist sector.</p>

  <h4>TITO'S 'INDEPENDENCE'</h4>

  <p>The independence of Yugoslavia, of which Yugoslavia officialdom boasts so much, is
  mostly a fraud. To the extent that it is true, it is based on the fact that in moments
  of crisis and danger, notwithstanding all the anti-Soviet postures of Tito at the
  recent Non-Aligned Conference in Havana particularly, the Yugoslavs can lean back or
  rather fall back on Soviet aid of both an economic and, when need be, of a diplomatic
  and military character.</p>

  <p>The truth about the Yugoslav "experiment" is that it has rested upon Tito's penchant
  for exploiting the class antagonisms between imperialism and the USSR, thus eking out
  an existence for his sociological innovations.</p>

  <p>If Yugoslavia is the clearest example of precisely what a socialist country should
  <strong>not</strong> embark upon, Poland is the second runner-up. Its indebtedness to
  the imperialist banks exceeds that of the Yugoslavs by more than 3 billion. It was not
  long ago that the imperialist press disclosed that Western bankers were now
  "monitoring," to use the choice phraseology of the <em>New York Times,</em> the economy
  of Poland.</p>

  <h4>BANKERS' GRIP ON POLISH ECONOMY</h4>

  <p>Poland in effect had reoriented a good deal of its economy toward the West following
  the unfortunate uprisings which began with the 1956 insurrections, then overturned the
  Gomulka regime in 1970, and as it turns out now pushed the Gierek regime, following the
  1974 strikes, further towards the West. Poland's economic planners were faced with a
  choice of reshaping the economy in either a more thorough and planned socialist
  orientation, including collectivization of the land, which is now on an almost
  thoroughly bourgeois farming basis, or in an orientation towards the West. They chose
  the latter course. They sought and obtained huge infusions of Western capital.</p>

  <p>But as with Yugoslavia, and as surely will happen in China with far more devastating
  results, they capitulated to the very same demands of the bankers which are standard
  for all socialist countries. These demands mean attaching strings which make the
  borrowers' plans self-defeating.</p>

  <p>An illuminating example as to the approach of the bankers in Poland goes as follows:
  The Polish officials needed a loan to reconstruct a factory which could produce small
  machines of various types. The bankers had a suggestion. Poland should produce golf
  carts. But, said the Polish officials, golf carts are salable only in the United
  States, not elsewhere. Well, that is too bad. It's golf carts or nothing.</p>

  <p>Much of Poland's $16 billion indebtedness to the Western bankers has been for
  projects destined for the Western capitalist market. The latter, however, has been
  unable to absorb the Polish products due to the erratic character of the capitalist
  economy. In addition, much of the indebtedness is for large-scale construction which
  will not be completed for perhaps years to come and which needs constant refinancing.
  This again brings about greater and greater reliance and dependence on the banks.</p>

  <p>It is no wonder that some of the capitalist newspapers have begun to use the phrase
  "control of the Polish economy by the West." Of course this is an exaggeration. But the
  fundamental fact of the matter is that, were it not for its close and intimate
  relationship with the Soviet Union, the Polish economy would fall lock, stock, and
  barrel like an overripe fruit into the hands of the imperialists.</p>

  <h4>SOLUTION LIES IN STRENGTHENING SOCIALIST COOPERATION</h4>

  <p>Indeed, it is not the domination of the USSR which the Polish workers have to fear.
  Rather it is the domination of the imperialist monopolies. If there is any solution of
  a fundamental character to the ailing Polish economy it lies in strengthening its
  relationship with the other socialist countries and disengaging itself, to the extent
  that it is possible and desirable, from the tentacles of imperialist finance
  capital.</p>

  <p>Of all the socialist countries, it is the USSR and the German Democratic Republic
  which have advanced economically and industrially in a socialist direction. Indeed,
  when one surveys what in better days used to be called the socialist camp, and which
  sociologically is still the socialist camp, it is the USSR which has made greater
  strides and which stands as a mighty fortress of socialist construction and
  anti-imperialist assistance.</p>

  <p>It is not to be wondered at, then, that the imperialist monopolies and the Pentagon
  war machine have made the USSR the target of the struggle. In a real sense the struggle
  between the USSR and the imperialist countries is a struggle between two opposing
  social systems &mdash; one based upon capitalist exploitation and the other based on
  socialist construction. In this sense Brzezinski is right, the two are competitors, not
  in the imperialist sense but in the sociological sense.</p>

  <p>It is a competition not unlike that between the old feudal system and bourgeois
  society at its dawning. But both feudalism and capitalism were exploiting societies and
  both were based on the retention and strengthening of private property in the means of
  production. The fundamental aim of socialism is not only the abolition of private
  property but the liquidation of all class rule. It therefore has as its aim the
  liberation of all humanity.</p>
