  <h5>Poland: Behind the Crisis [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>What's General Motors doing in Poland?</h1>

  <p><strong>OCTOBER 13, 1975</strong></p>

  <p>A significant development in economic relations between the Polish People's Republic
  and the U.S. may be in the making. It may profoundly affect the social structure not
  only of Poland but indirectly of other socialist countries in Eastern Europe and
  ultimately of the USSR itself. However, it is only the beginning of a trend and may be
  interrupted by counteracting economic and political events.</p>

  <p>On September 28, 1975, the General Motors Corporation announced that it intended to
  sign an agreement with Poland to manufacture trucks there for sale throughout the
  world. GM said that it plans to begin work in Lublin in eastern Poland on a large plant
  to manufacture half-ton trucks. GM claims this would be one of the largest of such
  ventures in Eastern Europe by an American company.</p>

  <p>It has also been reported that major operations in Poland are being considered by
  other American companies, including Westinghouse, The Singer Company already has a
  plant there.</p>

  <p>The details of the GM-Polish deal are not available at this time in the U.S., but
  big business interests in this country seem pleased at the development. Such
  arrangements are deemed to be profitable to the U.S. and welcome by the Polish
  government.</p>

  <h4>DIFFERS FROM SOVIET DEAL</h4>

  <p>The GM-Polish deal differs fundamentally, it seems to us, from agreements that were
  worked out between the Soviet Union and several West European capitalist countries to
  help build the giant truck factory complex on the Kama River in the USSR.</p>

  <p>In the Soviet deal, the capitalist countries are supplying materials, technology,
  and engineering to build a Soviet industrial complex, to be run, and of course owned,
  by the USSR. It is otherwise with the Polish deal.</p>

  <p>The plants are to be GM plants. Of course, GM will have to abide by the wage and
  labor code of the Polish government. There are no details available as to whether the
  Polish government will own the plant ultimately. But the products of the plant &mdash;
  the half-ton trucks &mdash; will be sold by GM throughout the world and profits of
  course will go to GM subject to restrictions by the Polish government.</p>

  <p>It is to be noted that the Polish government and the U.S. have also agreed in
  principle on a long-term grain deal. President Ford last week announced that the ban on
  the sale of grain to the Soviet Union and Poland has been lifted so far as Poland is
  concerned. It is also to be noted that the discriminatory trade practices which the
  U.S. has imposed on most socialist countries, including the USSR and China (denying
  them so-called "most favored nation" status), do not apply to Poland. It was lifted a
  long time ago following an insurrection in Poland and elsewhere in 1956.</p>

  <h4>OPEN DOOR TO MULTI-NATIONALS?</h4>

  <p>Whatever else the GM agreement may signify, the Polish People's Republic has opened
  the door, even if only slightly and temporarily, to the carnivorous multi-national
  corporations at a time when everywhere throughout the world and particularly in the
  underdeveloped countries they are under severe attack. Executives of these giant
  combines literally fear for their lives these days in a whole host of countries. They
  are everywhere a target of the wrath of the working class, especially among the
  oppressed people, but even in Western Europe, too.</p>

  <p>It is no exaggeration to say that the multi-national corporations are having to run
  for their lives just to retain a foothold in areas previously treated as the private
  domain of American finance capital.</p>

  <p>Trade and commercial relations between socialist and capitalist countries are of
  course unavoidable in the contemporary era and indeed absolutely necessary to avoid an
  almost total economic blockade such as the imperialists have imposed on Cuba, or
  earlier on the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries. There still is a
  virtual economic blockade by the U.S. against the Democratic People's Republic of
  Korea, the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of
  South Viet Nam, and Cambodia. There are still trade and economic restrictions against
  the People's Republic of China, the USSR, and Albania, as well as others.</p>

  <p>It is the <strong>specific</strong> character of the GM-Polish deal that is
  potentially very damaging to the social structure of Poland. That is our concern, not
  the general principle of economic and commercial agreements between capitalist and
  socialist countries. The GM-Polish deal could possibly be the opening for a
  neocolonialist penetration of American finance capital, which the ruling class in the
  U.S. has long been looking forward to in all of Eastern Europe and the USSR. It is from
  that point of view that we ought to examine it.</p>

  <p>This deal comes at a time when U.S. imperialism is particularly pressed by its world
  economic crisis, the drying up of old markets and sources of raw material, and its
  urgent need to reorient itself in a direction where it can recoup the surplus value
  which is elsewhere imperiled or even totally lost.</p>

  <p>We must examine the GM-Polish deal in the light of Poland's historical evolution
  since the Second World War and the vast transformations that have taken place since
  then.</p>

  <h4>HISTORICAL SETTING OF OVERTHROW</h4>

  <p>The overthrow of the old ruling classes of Poland did not result from the type of
  socialist revolution that took place in the USSR, in China, in Cuba, in Viet Nam, or
  even in Yugoslavia. The old capitalist and landlord class was overthrown as a result of
  a military-bureaucratic transformation, where old Polish society and its ruling classes
  were destroyed but a great deal was also left intact.</p>

  <p>The Polish People's Republic is largely a development that grew out of the
  revolutionary intervention of the Soviet army. Poland's old social order was
  transformed bureaucratically, and its possessing classes destroyed administratively.
  This is not to say that the Polish guerrilla forces, the Polish army, the Polish
  workers and peasants played no revolutionary role in this great social transformation.
  But it was the Soviet Red Army which was the dominant factor.</p>

  <p>One need only remember that as late as 1949 Stalin could find no better way to deal
  with Polish defense against NATO than the appointment of a Soviet citizen (although of
  Polish extraction) General Rokossovsky, as Polish Minister of Defense. This was a
  humiliation of the Polish United Workers Party and was certainly grist to the mill of
  Polish anti-communist for which genuine Polish communists could only offer lame
  apologetics.</p>

  <h4>GROWTH OF SOCIALIST PRODUCTION</h4>

  <p>However, by 1974, when the Polish People's Republic celebrated its 25th anniversary,
  Poland had become tenth among the world's industrial nations. Poland claims that
  between 1938 and 1973, per capita income rose from $200 to $1300, and that 1973
  industrial production was 20 times larger than before World War II.</p>

  <p>Following the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, both industry and
  agriculture were collectivized. Here it is necessary to take into account the
  insurrections of 1956 and 1970 if one is to view the GM-Polish deal in its correct
  historical context.</p>

  <h4>1956 REBELLION LED TO DECOLLECTIVIZATION</h4>

  <p>The 1956 rebellion, which overthrew the established regime, was universally
  recognized by the bourgeoisie everywhere, and accurately in our opinion, as a
  counter-revolutionary development. Had not Gomulka been ushered into power, it might
  have turned into a full-scale counterrevolution. Khrushchev wanted to militarily
  intervene and stop Gomulka from assuming authority. It was, however, the advice of
  China's Chairman Mao, who counseled against military intervention, that helped to
  restrain Khrushchev. (Mao, however, was firmly for the Soviet intervention in
  Hungary.)</p>

  <p>The counter-revolutionary insurrection, however, achieved some of its basic
  objectives. In the first place, agriculture was decollectivized. This is an
  exceptionally important development, which is frequently lost sight of or
  underestimated. Just as the change from individual farming to collective farming is a
  change in the mode of production in the sphere of agriculture, a transformation from
  collective to individual farming constitutes in effect a social counter-revolution in a
  vital sector of the nation's economy.</p>

  <p>It is one thing for a workers' state to retain individual farming, that is, to
  retain the bourgeois mode of agricultural production, for a while, pending its
  collectivization at a later stage. It is something else again to
  <strong>reintroduce</strong> a bourgeois mode of production in agriculture after
  collectivization. To then go forward to collectivization is that much harder.</p>

  <p>In Poland today about 85 percent of the agriculture is in private hands. Only one
  percent is collectivized; the rest is under some form of state control.
  Collectivization in agriculture for the most part has been abandoned and there is very
  little grounds to believe that it will be resumed on a large scale in the near
  future.</p>

  <p>The existence of this bourgeois form of production side by side with planned economy
  in industry operates as a big drag on the population as a whole and the working class
  in particular. The struggle between the two sectors of the economy goes on
  continually.</p>

  <h4>WHAT KIND OF "WORKERS' COUNCILS"?</h4>

  <p>And it is aggravated by the existence of so-called workers' councils &mdash; a
  development which arose as a result of the 1956 insurrection.</p>

  <p>Workers' councils as organs of political authority by the working class in the
  struggle to achieve a proletarian dictatorship and for a socialist society are, of
  course, a highly desirable phenomenon and everywhere have acted as battering rams
  against the old bourgeois order. But the workers' councils in Poland since 1956 were
  established <strong>to undermine the planned economy and not as organs of political
  power for the workers.</strong> They were a step in the direction of dismantling the
  planned socialist beginnings in Poland.</p>

  <p>However, they ceased to be the widespread phenomenon that the Western bourgeoisie
  thought they would be, and the Polish government gradually reined them in, so that
  today they are little more than areas for more lucrative material incentive, especially
  for the industrial bureaucracy. But they are still subject to national planning, which
  is fundamentally socialist in character.</p>

  <p>The planned economy of Poland is still a socialist economy &mdash; in spite of the
  existence of material incentive, in spite of the existence of "workers' councils," and
  in spite of the bureaucratic governmental apparatus. This is an achievement of the
  Polish working class and the Polish people in general and will not easily give way to
  capitalist counterrevolution. Surrender to capitalist economy will not come easily.</p>

  <p>The influence of the capitalist mode of agriculture in Poland is easily seen by the
  toll it takes on the life of the working class. Take the matter of inflation. Inflation
  is a phenomenon typical of capitalist countries, which can only make itself felt in a
  socialist country as a result of the influence of the world capitalist market or of
  mismanagement. As such, it can only be of marginal importance and the socialist
  government can easily absorb it without hurting the mass of the working people.</p>

  <p>In Poland, however, inflation is fed by the capitalist nature of farming, which as
  we said is mostly in private hands. As a result, the price of agricultural products has
  risen sharply at the expense of the workers and the rural poor.</p>

  <p>Only recently the Polish government admitted there was a two percent inflation rate
  last year (<em>New York Times,</em> October 9, 1975). In order to continue private
  capitalist agriculture, the government has been forced to give "increasingly large
  subsidies to Polish farmers <strong>who earn more for many of their products than
  consumers in cities pay for them."</strong> (<em>New York Times,</em> October 9, 1975.)
  This enriches the growing agricultural petty bourgeoisie at the expense of the workers
  and distorts and weakens the socialized sector of the economy. It operates as a
  constant invitation for reactionary intrusions and counter-revolutionary developments
  of all sorts. These in turn are bolstered by the existence of a powerful Catholic
  hierarchy, which stands four-square as a guardian of private property, particularly in
  the rural areas, where it remains strong.</p>

  <p>In Czechoslovakia, and especially in the German Democratic Republic, the two
  countries in Eastern Europe geographically close to Poland, agriculture is
  collectivized. It should therefore not be surprising, as the <em>New York Times</em>
  admits, that "Poles are painfully aware that shops in East Berlin and Prague are far
  better stocked then here, that food and clothing are better, that restaurants, hotels
  and other amenities are better abroad, and that the East Germans and the Czechs and
  Slovaks work shorter hours under better conditions." (<em>New York Times,</em> October
  9, 1975.)</p>

  <h4>PROGRESSIVE CHARACTER OF 1970 UPRISING</h4>

  <p>These, then, are the conditions under which the Polish People's Republic has
  embarked upon an agreement with General Motors which may have far-reaching
  consequences. The agreement should also be seen against the background of the 1970
  uprising of the workers which ousted Gomulka. It was a victorious insurrection and had
  the effect of reining in to some extent the depredations of the governmental
  bureaucracy against the economy and the workers.</p>

  <p>The 1970 rebellion differed fundamentally from the earlier one in 1956. It was
  directed exclusively against high prices of food, particularly meat. It was purely an
  economic struggle of the workers against the insensitivity of the bureaucracy. It was
  not a reactionary attack against the socialist character of the state.</p>

  <p>As such it was immensely effective, so much so that the government was thereafter
  obliged to <strong>freeze all food prices. They have now been frozen for the fourth
  successive year,</strong> even while industrial income has risen by an average of nine
  percent since 1971. This is a considerable achievement of the Polish workers. It has
  also thrown consternation into the hearts of the bureaucracy. Edward Gierek, who became
  the Polish CP leader after the workers ousted Gomulka, has learned to tread carefully
  since he assumed leadership.</p>

  <h4>OTHER TENDENCIES</h4>

  <p>Unquestionably, those who abandoned the Polish People's Republic long ago, calling
  it either a capitalist state or a satellite of the so-called "social imperialism" of
  the USSR, will merely regard the GM-Polish deal as confirmation of their viewpoint. In
  like fashion, the Socialist Workers Party, which nominally holds that the countries of
  Eastern Europe are workers' states but in practice treats them as capitalist states,
  will feel reinforced in its views.</p>

  <p>We have never been uncritical supporters of any of the socialist countries. But our
  view of the 1956 rebellion differed fundamentally from that of the SWP which joined the
  bourgeoisie in hysterically hailing the "revolutionary development." We clearly
  recognized the reactionary character of the rebellion but also saw that the
  counter-revolution had only partially succeeded.</p>

  <p>We supported the workers in 1970 precisely because their struggle reinforced the
  struggle for a healthier workers' state, unlike the 1956 rebellion.</p>

  <p>The GM deal, in and of itself, has only a potential for counter-revolutionary
  developments. Whether the process set in motion is reinforced or halted depends on
  further developments not only in Poland and Eastern Europe, but also in the USSR. In
  the long run, it will depend on the outcome of the struggle between the two world
  systems &mdash; that of the socialist countries and that of imperialism, which is daily
  being battered everywhere.</p>

  <p>A successful revolution in Portugal, in Spain, in France, or for that matter in any
  other significant area of the world, can reinforce the determination of the Polish
  working class to retain and strengthen socialism as against the willingness of the
  Polish leaders to accommodate themselves to imperialism.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile, our basic appraisal of the Polish People's Republic as a workers'
  or socialist state &mdash; though badly deformed &mdash; remains valid. The socialist
  sector of the economy, brought into being through the overthrow of the old
  landlord-capitalist class, is decisive. And it must be defended by class-conscious
  workers everywhere against the offensives of imperialism and internal reaction.</p>
