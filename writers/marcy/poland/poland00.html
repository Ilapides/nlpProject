  <title>Poland: Behind the Crisis (1982): Introduction</title>

  <h5>Poland: Behind the Crisis [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>The following collection of articles about events in Poland was written for the most
  part during and immediately after the August 1980 strikes in that country. The
  articles were originally published in <em>Workers World</em> newspaper and still offer
  a guide to action as well as to understanding. By the time the material appears in this
  pamphlet, events will have proceeded in Poland and the political situation will have
  changed, if only to a degree. Nevertheless, the series as a whole, which is printed
  here together with previous articles on the (not accidentally) <strong>Polish</strong>
  Pope provides an indispensable analysis of current Polish society and arms the reader
  with a basic comprehension of the class forces therein.</p>

  <p>The articles are all too unique in their emphasis on the real reason for the Polish
  crisis  &mdash;  namely, the tremendous loans by Western imperialist banks and their
  consequent pressure on the Polish government to retrench and cut back on benefits to
  the Polish workers. This banker-imposed retrenchment very much includes the rise in the
  price of meat which touched off the August protests. Others have
  <strong>mentioned</strong> the role of the Western banks, but nobody else has shown the
  banks as the fundamental cause of the crisis and insistently called for an indefinite
  moratorium on this (now) $25 billion debt, as Sam Marcy has done here.</p>

  <p>The U.S. ruling class and its sycophants have hailed the Polish protests and wildly
  acclaimed the workers' strikes (the <strong>Polish</strong> workers' strikes, that is,
  not the strikes of <strong>U.S.</strong> workers!). Marcy shows that it is not really a
  question of the rights of Polish workers, but rather one of the right of imperialist
  banks to rule over socialist Poland. From his analysis it is clear that the Polish
  United Workers Party leadership could have called upon the strikers to fight the
  Western banks as well as to check the capitalist tendencies in the countryside. Thus
  they could have outmaneuvered the restorationist tendencies of the Church hierarchy and
  right-wing opponents of the regime. But they did not do this, or apparently even
  attempt it. And other class forces have begun to take command.</p>

  <p>The situation was and is a complex one. At first glance it would appear that the
  events of last August were merely a matter of workers protesting difficult conditions
  and complaining about bureaucratic practices. And indeed if that were all that was at
  stake in Poland, it would be easy to side with the strike movement and solidarize with
  "Solidarity."</p>

  <p>But as Marcy shows, infinitely more is at stake than this. One almost infallible
  guidepost in understanding at least the broad character of the events is the propaganda
  campaign of the U.S. ruling class in behalf  &mdash;  allegedly  &mdash;  of the Polish workers (at
  the very same time that they are waging a ruthless campaign for wage-cuts, layoffs and
  social cutbacks in the <strong>United States!</strong> ) But that does not answer the
  bigger questions, which are posed in the following pages.</p>

  <p>Marcy's articles do not deal so much with the <strong>propaganda</strong> of the
  ruling class as with the actual tactics and strategy for its planned take over of
  Poland by a "cold" counter-revolution  &mdash;  that is, by economic penetration and political
  infiltration. This is what the Polish as well as American workers need to know most of
  all  &mdash;  the concealed strategy of the U.S. ruling class.</p>

  <p>It is this strategy, by the way, that explains why a section of the ruling class,
  along with the Polish Cardinal and the Polish Pope, want to "go slow" in Poland so as
  to avoid a Soviet intervention, with or without civil war. Some of them think they can
  travel the <strong>Yugoslav</strong> road toward capitalism, and in fact they are doing
  their best to get the Polish workers onto this particular highway in the name of Polish
  nationalism, virtual supremacy of Church over State(i.e., the <strong>workers'</strong>
  state), fortification of private property in land, and the planned decentralization of
  the nationalized factories.</p>

  <p>The new union "Solidarity" has now had time to crystallize its program somewhat
  since the bulk of these articles were first printed. And it is clear from Solidarity's
  collaboration with right-wing elements who are even farther to the right than the
  Catholic hierarchy that the <strong>leadership</strong> of Solidarity is definitely not
  in solidarity with the goals of socialism and has in fact consciously taken the road to
  capitalist restoration.</p>

  <p>At the moment these lines are being written, Lech Walesa, the president of
  Solidarity, is visiting the Pope in Rome. This is no religious pilgrimage but a highly
  political errand for world capitalism. In the middle of his blessing, the Pope, an
  "expert" on Poland, told Walesa to "go slow," implying that he should not push for a
  confrontation with the state. At almost the same instant in Washington, that most
  hawkish of Cold Warriors, Zbigniew Brzezinski, another "expert" on Poland, expressed
  satisfaction with the present tempo of the capitalist restoration movement, calling the
  new situation a "compromise" that should be supported by the United States. This view,
  like the Pope's advice, flows from the estimate that the basic shift of Polish society
  is to the right and, given the present state of things and the policies now being
  followed, ultimate capitalist restoration is inevitable  &mdash;  again, if there is no
  confrontation.</p>

  <p>Even under these difficult conditions we support all the progressive demands of the
  Polish workers, including anti-bureaucratic demands (such as an end to corruption,
  special privileges, etc.). And there should be no <strong>principled</strong> objection
  to strikes in a socialist country. If the workers sometimes go on strike, they are not,
  ipso facto, opposing socialism. But the timing of a strike, who leads it, and the
  circumstances under which it takes place can indeed give it an anti-socialist
  character.</p>

  <p>Lenin <strong>insisted</strong> upon the workers' right to strike and spelled out
  his position during the famous Trade Union Discussion on December 30, 1920. "We must
  use these organizations (i.e., the unions  &mdash;  V.C.) <strong>to protect the workers from
  their state. ..."</strong> he said. And he added the next day that there were
  "bureaucratic distortions" in the state. But Lenin was talking to
  <strong>communists</strong> and the workers generally understood that both capitalism
  and its subservient Church hierarchy were their class enemies. Lenin finished the above
  sentence, incidentally, by saying "... and to get them (the unions) to protect our
  state." It is hardly necessary to add that Lenin had in mind by such an approach the
  improvement and strengthening of the workers' state and was looking forward to a more
  direct, more perfect workers' rule, as outlined by him in his <em>The State and
  Revolution.</em></p>

  <p>Neither Lech Walesa nor any of his leading cohorts or advisers has the slightest
  interest in <em>The State and Revolution</em> or for that matter in Lenin himself. The
  Pope and the Polish Cardinal are their political guiding stars, the bitterly
  anti-Soviet and vulgarly anti-Leninist Solzhenitsyn is their ideologist while the
  Rockefellers, the Mellons, the Morgans, the Krupps, the Flicks and the other
  imperialist bankers are their off-stage puppet-masters.</p>

  <p>In view of all that has happened, it is quite probable that the <strong>official
  Polish Communist</strong> trade union leaders have lost the confidence of the majority
  of the industrial workers. If that is so it is a painful fact and must be recognized.
  But the formation of an "independent" union is something else again.</p>

  <p>It is like many an "independent" union in the United States. The latter begins as an
  opposition to some bureaucratic practice in the national or international organization
  of workers in an industry. But once it cuts its ties to the rest of its class, it falls
  prey to the scheming pressures of the big corporation. At first it may register some
  substantial gain, and of course, the dues are lowered! But later, the company takes the
  "union" over and reimposes the slave conditions of the past.</p>

  <p>This is only a partial analogy with the "independent" union called "Solidarity." The
  difference in Poland is that the "independent" union there is not the product of naive
  or inexperienced leaders, it is being guided by a whole team of rightwingers and Church
  figures who know just what they want. Its "victory" is far more likely to be an
  historic defeat for the working class than is the emergence of a company union in an
  isolated U.S. plant.</p>

  <p>As opposed to the Polish workers "independent" leadership <strong>the workers
  themselves</strong> are another matter. The workers could throw off the right-wing
  leadership entirely and be the best defenders  &mdash;  and rejuvenators  &mdash;  of the workers'
  state. But for this to happen, there has to be a <strong>communist</strong>
  orientation. Under present circumstances, the Communist leadership or a section of it
  must appeal to them against the reaction  &mdash;  against the hierarchy, against the rural
  bourgeoisie, and above all, against the Western imperialist bankers, who are exploiting
  them through the colossal loans of the past few years. To do this, the Polish CP
  leaders would have to repudiate their own recent course of conciliation to these
  elements.</p>

  <p>Marcy showed in these articles that hard as it may have been to do it, it could have
  been done. Positions have hardened in the few months since then. But as long as the
  Polish party leadership has not actually capitulated to the pro-imperialist bourgeoisie
  and has not been overthrown, it is still possible to do it.</p>

  <p>The world movement would receive a terrible blow if the course of socialist progress
  should be wholly reversed in Poland and a bourgeois regime reinstituted. But this blow
  can be fended off or avoided altogether if the forces of socialism can rise to their
  historic task. It is to be hoped that they can and will.</p>
