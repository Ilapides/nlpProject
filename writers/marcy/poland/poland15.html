  <hr />

  <h1>Appendix A</h1>

  <h3>Chronology</h3>

  <p><strong>January 26, 1979</strong></p>

  <p>New York Times, in front-page story, reveals: "As a part of an effort to obtain a
  major new loan, Poland has agreed to permit Western banks to monitor its economic
  policies, American bankers say. They regard the concession as a historic breakthrough
  in the financial relations with the communist world.</p>

  <p>"To persuade the banks to agree to the new financing, Poland has already had to
  announce a strict, new budget for 1979 and provide its creditors with comprehensive,
  new information on its financial situation.</p>

  <p>"The banks involved in the new credit will henceforth track the progress of the
  Polish economy much as the International Monetary Fund monitors the economies of
  non-communist countries in financial distress."</p>

  <h4>April 24, 1980</h4>

  socialist. " Walesa says he agrees with "Solzhenitsyn's criticism of the West as well

  tsars.")</p>

  <h4>February 6, 1981</h4>

  <p>Les Aspin, member of House Armed Services Committee, writes in a <em>New York
  Times</em> op-ed, "The strongest foreign leverage on Poland is the huge debt to Western
  banks that Poland, unlike other communist countries, has racked up. The Polish debt now
  gives Western governments the means to influence the direction that the Polish
  government takes." Aspin outlines a plan for destabilizing Poland leading to a cold
  takeover of the country by the U.S.</p>

  <h4>March</h4>

  <p>Western banks, meeting with Polish authorities, state that debt would be rescheduled
  under certain conditions such as that Solidarity be guaranteed relative freedom of
  action (<em>New York Times,</em> March 31, 1981).</p>

  <h4>March 29</h4>

  <p>On separate TV talk shows Sen. Percy, Defense Secretary Weinberger and Secretary of
  State Haig viciously attack the USSR on Poland and hail "independent" trade union
  movement. "Solidarity" leaders do not disavow this show of support.</p>

  help you.' " TASS adds that recent article in the <em>Washington Post</em> chronicled a
  drive by CIA to recruit Polish-speaking agents.</p>

  <h4>August 1</h4>

  <p>Reagan sends food aid to Poland while cutting food stamps in U.S.</p>
