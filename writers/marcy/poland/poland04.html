  Poland</title>

  <h1>How the U.S. plans to take over Poland</h1>

  <p><strong>FEBRUARY 11, 1981</strong></p>

  <p>The U.S. is readying plans to take over Poland economically and politically, and it
  is this fact that raises the possibility of a counter-action by Poland's socialist
  allies.</p>

  <p>The severe political crisis facing Poland is overshadowed in the U.S. media and
  press by the purported danger of Soviet intervention. The plans of the U.S. in alliance
  with Western interests to take over Poland have, on the other hand, been given little
  if any attention until just this week. However, because of the gravity of the situation
  and the perilous and unforeseeable consequences for U.S. and Western imperialist
  interests, some very pertinent facts as well as positions have now surfaced in the
  press.</p>

  <h4>ASPIN'S OP-ED PIECE</h4>

  <p>On February 6, 1981, Les Aspin, a former member of the House Banking and Currency
  Committee and now a member of the House Armed Services Committee, made public the
  orientation of the U.S. position with respect to Poland (New York Times, Op-Ed page).
  Although he uses language of a euphemistic character calculated to soften and make more
  palatable the takeover plans that the U.S. is projecting, he nevertheless lays them out
  in sufficient detail for anyone to get the message &mdash; if not loud, then certainly
  very clear. It is probably directed particularly at calming the fears of the Western
  allies and holding them in line.</p>

  <p>"If Soviet tanks," he opens, "do not determine Poland's future course, Western
  bankers can. " How's that? "The leaders of the Polish Communist Party," he goes on,
  "would never admit it, but the strongest foreign leverage on Poland is the huge debt to
  Western banks that Poland, unlike other Communist countries, has racked up. The Polish
  hard currency debt at the end of 1980 was about $25 billion," he says, "one of the
  largest debt burdens of any advanced developing country. Almost all of Warsaw's debts
  are held by Western banks and governments."</p>

  <p>Aspin doesn't say how such a small, relatively poor country managed by a socialist
  government was able to obtain loans of such staggering amounts. The truth of the
  matter, of course, is that these loans were made on the basis that the Western
  capitalist countries would open their markets to Polish products, specifically destined
  for Western Europe and the U.S.</p>

  <p>The capitalist governments, using the economic crisis as an excuse, have gone back
  on their promises to the Polish government and have in fact not only not opened wide
  the markets, but on the contrary constricted them as a means of further strengthening
  their financial hold on Poland and making it more or less inevitable that more loans
  would thus become indispensable.</p>

  <h4>CRUSHING DEBT BURDEN</h4>

  <p>Thus it is that mere debt service costs for the loans, says Les Aspin, "equal all
  that Poland earns in hard currency. In 1981 alone, Poland must borrow $11 billion to
  $12 billion."</p>

  <p>It will require, Aspin continues, "about $3.5 billion to $4 billion in new
  hard-currency loans to finance debt service and to continue to run a trade deficit. ...
  Moreover, the prospect for 1982 is more of the same. ..."</p>

  <p>Agreement to such huge loans and extortionate interest, which would normally be
  regarded by the responsible national leadership of a small country as spurious and
  extravagant, assumes the proportion, in this case, of real collusion between the
  banking interests and elements of the Polish leadership. That is why Aspin concludes
  that. The Polish debt now gives Western governments the means to influence the
  direction that the Polish government takes. ..."</p>

  <p>What he really means is that the U.S. government in alliance with the Western
  imperialists can now dictate, not merely influence, the direction that the Polish
  government takes &mdash; providing, he adds, "they coordinate their efforts" (which
  they are feverishly doing!) and (please listen to this!) "do not overplay their
  hand."</p>

  <p>Aspin and those for whom he speaks are advising that the banks roll over the debts
  that will shortly be due and present certain conditions to the Poles. If the U.S. works
  it nicely and neatly, these will in reality effectuate a dismantling of what is left at
  the present time of the socialist system, and put the Polish economy under the control
  of the U.S. and its imperialist allies.</p>

  <h4>U.S. GUARANTEES 'UNPLEASANT ALTERNATIVES'</h4>

  <p>If Poland refuses to go along, he continues, it has only "unpleasant alternatives."
  If it should declare a moratorium and default, he says, "all lending to Poland would
  cease and its assets in the West would be seized. Nothing would be shipped to Poland
  without cash in advance."</p>

  <p>This would be handing the Polish government the Iran treatment, whereby the U.S.
  seized Iranian assets in an effort to destabilize them economically and make it
  impossible for them to continue normal financial and economic relations with other
  capitalist countries.</p>

  <p>If Poland merely tried to reschedule its loans and suspend payments on the principal
  unilaterally it would lose all "credit" with the West. In any case, "the loss of credit
  and the need to balance trade would mean immediate and major cuts in imports of food,
  spare parts, and raw materials. " However, he says, if Poland seeks to reschedule its
  debt on the basis of an agreement with the West, then of course the U.S. and Western
  banks can impose their economic system, if, of course, the West doesn't "overplay its
  hand."</p>

  <h4>BANKS HOPEFUL FOR A 'COLD TAKEOVER'</h4>

  <p>The U.S. program can then be implemented by the Polish authorities. In fact, he goes
  on to say, if the U.S. program is put into practice, then "with that program <strong>we
  could help underwrite a peaceful resolution of the economic and political
  crisis."</strong> In other words, the strength of the U.S. and Western banks in Poland
  is so large and their influence so great economically alone, not counting the political
  factors, that the U.S. imperialists have the power to <strong>underwrite</strong> a
  peaceful resolution of the economic and political crisis &mdash; another euphemistic
  phrase for the cold takeover of the country and an end to the imperialist economic
  destabilization that is wracking the country.</p>

  <p>And what would be the price, as he puts it, for Warsaw and Moscow?</p>

  <p>"The price would be the toleration of an independent source of political authority:
  Solidarity." One has to reread this to really believe that it could be put in writing
  at a time when presumably the Polish and Soviet leaders can read it too! For what it
  says is that, in return for dismantling the socialist system and giving authority to an
  "independent" source (now we know how really independent Solidarity is if the bankers
  are willing to put their trust in it!), they will reschedule the loans.</p>

  <p>Thus, "In exchange for rescheduling the debt, banks, at the behest of Western
  governments [meaning the U.S. and above all BankAmerica, Chase, Manufacturers Hanover,
  etc., ] would certainly be within their rights to urge [the softest of diplomatic
  euphemisms for <strong>dictate to</strong>] Warsaw to adopt economic reforms."</p>

  <h4>'REFORMS' MEAN OVERTHROW OF SYSTEM</h4>

  <p>Aspin doesn't spell out the reforms, but the <em>Washington Post</em> of February
  11, 1981, which deals with the same question makes quite clear what these reforms would
  be. "It is widely believed in the West that the Warsaw government would have to take a
  number of reform measures . . ." The first mentioned is to "decentralize its management
  of the economy."</p>

  <p>Decentralization of the management of a socialist economy under the existing
  circumstances of the Polish economic and political situation means to dismantle the
  socialist system. The public ownership of the means of production would then constitute
  merely a legal premise which, given the present political situation, would be reduced
  to a legalistic fiction and pave the way for complete dismantling of public
  ownership.</p>

  <p>The second reform demanded, according to the <em>Washington Post,</em> would be to
  "give greater support to the private farmers as the most efficient producers." This
  means not merely permitting the existence of private farming, but for the new
  pro-capitalist government to support bourgeois agriculture "as the most efficient
  producers," which means giving it precedence over whatever collective and state farms
  exist. This would completely nullify whatever socialist forms exist at all.</p>

  <h4>U.S. GOVERNMENT OPENLY ADMITS PRESSURE</h4>

  <p>Finally, the U.S. government, which has previously extended loans and credit to the
  Polish government, and has never had the temerity, indeed the impudence, to openly
  attach strings to any loans, does so now. The <em>Washington Post</em> of February 11,
  1981, quotes State Department spokesman William Dyess: " 'Our feeling is that what's
  needed most of all in Poland is internal economic reform. The Poles know this,' he
  said, indicating that until the Warsaw government itself takes action that shows it is
  'serious' about improving the economic situation, the Reagan administration is unlikely
  to pump in more money."</p>

  <p>It is therefore clear from both these sources &mdash; the official U.S. government
  position as well as Les Aspin, who is speaking somewhat less officially but nonetheless
  authoritatively in revealing the facts and real position of the U.S. government &mdash;
  that the U.S. banks working in concert with their Western European counterparts have
  embarked on what amounts to economic strangulation and destabilization in Poland. Once
  having gotten a strong foothold in the economic system by these enormous and
  extraordinary loans, they now seek to dictate an overturn of the socialist system.</p>

  <h4>DESTABILIZATION AIDED BY WEAK LEADERSHIP</h4>

  <p>This is an utterly new phenomenon in a socialist country, but is a time-honored
  practice of imperialist finance capital in the underdeveloped countries. They could not
  have accomplished this without a weak, vacillating, and accommodating leadership in
  Poland which has been incapable of dealing with the workers and has opened the door to
  anti-socialist, anti-communist, and counter-revolutionary elements whom the bankers
  recommend as a partner for collaboration with a pro-capitalist government.</p>

  <p>As Aspin says, "An important element would be labor peace. Although the bankers need
  not say it [Aspin says it for them in such elegant language], peace can only be
  achieved by dealing with the Solidarity labor movement as a partner."</p>

  <p>Is it possible that there are no socialist forces in the Polish leadership who are
  willing and able to fight back, rather than become enslaved to imperialist finance
  capital? Is it possible that Poland's socialist allies, particularly those on the
  borders of Poland, will sit idly by while BankAmerica, Manufacturers Hanover, Chase,
  etc., etc., complete the destabilization and takeover?</p>

  <p>The Polish political crisis cannot long continue. Poland is truly at a crossroads.
  It will either find the inner resources and revolutionary determination to resist
  reenslavement to imperialism and resume the road of socialist construction, or it will
  once again become a satellite of imperialist geopolitics in the service of the U. S.
  banks and as a battering ram against the Soviet Union.</p>
