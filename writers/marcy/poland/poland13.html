  <h5>Poland: Behind the Crisis [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Yalta and teh Polish anti-fascist movement</h1>

  <p>DECEMBER 27, 1981</p>

  <p>If you are a worker, Black or white, Latin or Asian, gay or straight, young or old,
  you are affected by the crisis in Poland. Surely you must know that the headlines in
  the newspapers and the stories in the media are dominated by the events in Poland.</p>

  <p>This diverts attention from important news which workers are concerned with most
  immediately and directly &mdash; insecurity on the job, layoffs, and the rising cost of
  living. There is also the fear underlying everything else that the events in Poland may
  lead to military conflict which would involve all of us in a new, terrible
  conflagration.</p>

  <p>It would be no good at all to close our eyes to what is going on in Poland.</p>

  <p>If you heard President Reagan's Christmas Eve address, you surely would have noticed
  how emotional he seemed to be about the Polish workers and their hardships. By
  contrast, he never said a word about the nearly 10 million unemployed workers here in
  this country.</p>

  <p>Again, while he seemed so deeply moved by the hardships of Polish workers, he never
  said a word about the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO)
  strikers whose union he broke illegally, whose members the government has harassed,
  fined, and imprisoned.</p>

  <p>Reagan mourned the loss of life in Poland, but the four who committed suicide during
  the PATCO strike as a result of hardship and harassment are passed over in silence.</p>

  <p>Again, he talked about the many refugees coming out of Poland. Again, by contrast,
  he never said anything about the thousands of refugees from Haiti who are in U.S.
  concentration camps, many dying of hunger and living in dread of being deported to one
  of the most brutal dictatorial regimes in modern times.</p>

  <p>Okay, you agree on that. But do two wrongs make a right? This question must be
  answered.</p>

  <p>It cannot be properly answered unless we take into account how the Polish government
  was created. No understanding of the Polish problem can possibly be arrived at unless
  we first ask ourselves this question again and again.</p>

  <p>The Polish government is the product of the Second World War. It was created in
  1945. The manner in which it was created is of supreme importance to understanding what
  is happening now.</p>

  <p>It was created as the result of an agreement at the close of the Second World War
  between, on the one hand, the Soviet Union represented by Stalin and, on the other, the
  United States represented by President Roosevelt and Great Britain represented by Prime
  Minister Churchill.</p>

  <h4>YALTA AGREEMENT</h4>

  <p>This agreement was reached at the Yalta conference in the spring of 1945. You can
  look this up in any book, newspaper, or magazine of the time and you will find these
  facts to be true.</p>

  <p>Yalta has since become a dirty word in the jargon of all the right-wing reactionary
  elements in the U.S., especially those in the Pentagon. Roosevelt himself has since
  been vilified in terms of near treason.</p>

  <p>Why? The Yalta agreement constituted the basis of a compromise between the Soviet
  Union as a socialist state (or communist state, however you wish to call it) and the
  principal Western allies &mdash; Great Britain and the United States &mdash; as
  capitalist states.</p>

  <p>What kind of a government could possibly emerge if the Soviet Union was concerned
  with establishing a socialist government in Poland and the U.S. and Great Britain were
  interested in reestablishing a capitalist state in Poland?</p>

  <p>Can there be a state which is half capitalist and half socialist? That was one of
  the questions presumably settled by the Yalta agreement.</p>

  <p>There were many other questions left open. There were, however, certain pertinent
  facts that had to be taken into account if there was to be a new Poland erected as a
  result of an agreement between the USSR and the capitalist West.</p>

  <p>It was agreed by the powers participating in the Yalta conference that Poland should
  have a democratic form of government. Both sides agreed to that.</p>

  <p>Elections were to follow and a parliament set up. All this did subsequently take
  place.</p>

  <p>The Yalta agreement was therefore responsible for having set up, or helped to set up
  together with the Polish people, a new Polish republic.</p>

  <h4>TWO CURRENTS STRUGGLING FOR LEADERSHIP</h4>

  <p>Inside of Poland, however, there were two divergent political currents struggling
  for leadership of the future government.</p>

  <p>On the one hand there was the Lublin group which was supported by workers and by the
  strong resistance forces organized in the struggle against the Nazis. The Lublin group
  was in support of and alliance with the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>On the other hand there was the group headed by Stanislaw Mikolajczyk which had its
  headquarters in London and was called the Polish Government in Exile.</p>

  <p>Note this very important fact. The Lublin group, composed of the progressive
  resistance forces allied with and cooperating with the Soviet Union, <strong>had their
  headquarters located directly in Poland during the entire war.</strong> Mikolajczyk and
  his principal supporters fled and established themselves in their headquarters in
  London. The difference is important.</p>

  <p>The strong, indigenous anti-Nazi forces were clearly lined up with the Lublin
  government. Mikolajczyk's group was small, weak, and his armed supporters
  negligible.</p>

  <p>Toward the close of the war, while the Nazi forces were still strong in Poland, the
  Soviet Red Army launched the final offensive to liberate Poland. Yes, it was the Red
  Army that liberated Poland. This, too, you can find in any book, magazine, or newspaper
  of the time.</p>

  <p>It cost the Soviet Union 900,000 men and women &mdash; nearly twice as many dead as
  the U.S. suffered in World War II Korean war and the Viet Nam war combined.</p>

  <p>That's the measure of concern the Soviet Union had in guaranteeing the establishment
  of a new, independent Poland.</p>

  <p>The Yalta agreement had to take this into account in arriving at the compromise
  between Mikolajczyk who was in alliance with the U.S. and Britain, and the broad
  anti-fascist, progressive and socialist resistance movement of Lublin. The compromise
  agreement was for Mikolajczyk to join the Lublin government and thereby form a
  coalition of both the socialist and capitalist political interests.</p>

  <p>It would be a coalition government. A parliament was established in 1946 as a result
  of a referendum vote of the people.</p>

  <p>Opposition parties were legalized, especially what was called the Peasant Party
  which was the name Mikolajczyk chose for his party. He became a vice-premier of the
  coalition government and was put in charge of the ministry of agriculture.</p>

  <p>Thus far, the Yalta compromise agreement was carried out. A referendum vote was
  held, a parliament established, an opposition party legalized.</p>

  <p>The Lublin supporters won an overwhelming majority. The Mikolajczyk opposition also
  scored heavily in the elections, but as a minority party.</p>

  <p>What happened to this compromise which was aimed to maintain stable, peaceful
  relations between the Soviet Union and the Western capitalist countries after the war
  against the fascist powers?</p>

  <p>This agreement, as we said, was a compromise in which both sides gave some ground.
  Among those in the Left, many thought Stalin gave too much ground in Poland (and
  elsewhere) when in fact the Red Army with the native resistance forces could have
  easily taken all of Poland and established it as a full-fledged socialist
  government.</p>

  <p>The reactionary Polish exiles' forces under Mikolajczyk were negligible and were
  composed mostly of right-wing and ultra-rightist forces who before the war had
  supported the fascist dictatorship of Pilsudski.</p>

  <p>The attacks on the Yalta agreement from the Left were negligible and had little
  effect.</p>

  <p>The Yalta agreement, it must be remembered, was signed, sealed and delivered by
  Stalin for the USSR, Winston Churchill for Britain, and President Roosevelt for the
  U.S. Whether this was a viable agreement that could stand the test of history was left
  to the Polish people to decide.</p>

  <p>The antagonistic internal class forces were left to work out their own destiny
  without interference from either East or West. And for a brief period, very brief
  indeed, it seemed that it might work.</p>

  <h4>SHARP REVERSAL OF U.S. FOREIGN POLICY</h4>

  <p>But something happened early after the agreement was signed which smashed it to
  bits. It began with the death of Roosevelt and the sharp reversal of foreign policy
  during Truman's and succeeding administrations in the U.S.</p>

  <p>The attacks, which began against Roosevelt after the Yalta agreement, took on a wild
  momentum during the Truman-Acheson period and reached a crescendo in the following
  years. Nothing less than repudiation of the agreement was called for.</p>

  <p>By the time of the Potsdam conference, which took place between July 17 and August
  2, 1945, the U.S. had perceived that the balance of world forces between the
  imperialist powers of Great Britain and the U.S. on the one hand, and the USSR, on the
  other, had greatly changed militarily to the advantage of the U.S.</p>

  <p>It should be remembered that by this time Truman had succeeded Roosevelt at the
  conference and Prime Minister Churchill was succeeded by Prime Minister Atlee. The
  conference agreement resulted in a long but vague statement that the U.S. at the time
  no longer had any military reason to honor its commitments.</p>

  <p>Certainly that's the way it was perceived four days after the ending of the
  conference. Four days after the conference was over, the U.S., which had long prepared
  the development of the atomic bomb, dropped it on Hiroshima.</p>

  <p>This was mostly an attempt to intimidate the USSR, the militant working class of the
  world and the impending upsurge of the oppressed people of the world. It was not at all
  an attempt to save U.S. lives, as Truman claimed at the time.</p>

  <p>It was an attempt to present U.S. military dominance with the aid of the atomic
  bomb, which the U.S. held in monopoly, and, in the jargon of the right-wingers, "roll
  back the red carpet in all of Eastern Europe."</p>

  <p>Thereafter, a vicious anti-Soviet offensive was opened up in the U.S. on foreign
  policy along with a domestic witchhunt of frightening proportions against the
  progressive movement and the trade unions that were in any way sympathetic to the
  struggle for workers' rights, civil liberties, or socialism.</p>

  <p>Overturning the Yalta agreement became a cardinal principle of all the
  ultra-rightists McCarthyites, Birch Society neo-fascist, and others. Thus, no sooner
  had this agreement really been signed than the U.S. administration attempted to
  undermine it, repudiate it, and commence covert as well as overt operations to
  undermine the existing legal government in Poland.</p>

  <p>Mikolajczyk, who had become a vice-premier of the coalition government then saw a
  new opportunity for the possibility of the U.S. and Britain openly intervening to
  establish a capitalist government. He therefore resigned from the coalition government
  and came to the U.S. to organize all the reactionary Polish exile groups in the U.S.
  and try to coordinate all the Polish-Americans behind a "liberate Poland" campaign.</p>

  <p>As the <em>New Columbia Encyclopedia</em> (one-volume 1975 edition) states, "He left
  behind him nationalists rightists and some other opponents operating as underground
  forces in 1946, a year after Yalta."</p>

  <p>The slogan of "liberation," by which they meant overthrow of the existing Polish
  government, became the battle cry not only during the Truman but also the
  Dulles-Eisenhower period. In addition to these overt and covert measures of subversion,
  the Western capitalist powers took advantage of the devastated conditions resulting
  from the Nazi invasion and war to withhold not only economic assistance but trade in
  general, unless the Polish government agreed in the first place to certain so-called
  liberal reforms.</p>

  <p>Such reforms were understood everywhere in the progressive world to mean the
  rejection of socialist construction and the establishment of capitalist relations.</p>

  <h4>WHAT WEST MEANS BY 'REFORMS'</h4>

  <p>When the word "liberal reform" is used in the West, it means a capitalist reform. It
  does not at all have anything to do with free speech, freedom of religion, and so
  on.</p>

  <p>What they mean by "liberal reforms" are the introduction and strengthening of
  capitalist private property in industry, in agriculture, and in all other phases of
  life.</p>

  <p>The communists, socialists, and Progressives were for socializing Poland with
  production for use, not for profit. But they were willing to compromise on a
  live-and-let-live basis if the Western capitalist powers would agree not to intervene
  by subversion, economic blockade, or the deprivation of financial credits for commerce
  badly needed as a result of the country's economic status resulting from the war.</p>

  <p>This is the ABC of the Polish crisis today.</p>

  <p>What the U.S., British, and later the German and French imperialists did over the
  years was a continuation of the same subversion by covert means and economic
  penetration. The inability of succeeding communist leaders to put Poland's economic
  house in order is due basically to the intransigence of the capitalist powers in not
  letting Poland get economically on its feet to build socialism. They used both overt
  and covert subversion through the medium of financial penetration.</p>

  <p>Poland may have disappeared from the headlines for some years, but the effort to
  destabilize it and return it to the capitalist camp was never abandoned. Therein lies
  the basic cause of the recent crisis in Poland.</p>
