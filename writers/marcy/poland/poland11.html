  <h1>Imperialism and papal politics</h1>

  <p><strong>OCTOBER 18, 1978</strong></p>

  <p>In the midst of all the hullabaloo and blazing headlines about the "surprise" over
  the selection of a Polish archbishop as the new Pope, it shouldn't be overlooked that
  it was the U.S. delegation to the cardinals' conclave that made the nomination.</p>

  <p>This fact wasn't in the headlines. It was tucked away in a rather obscure paragraph
  in the <em>Washington Post</em> (November 18, 1978). "The Polish cardinal had in fact
  been proposed by the Americans," says the paper, presumably as a way out of the impasse
  created by the struggles among the Italian candidates.</p>

  <p>Nor is it surprising that the source for this information is given as French
  Cardinal Jean Guyot of Toulouse. France, it should be remembered, is one of the
  imperialist powers more independent of the U.S.</p>

  <p>Another point that seems small but looms large under the circumstances is that the
  only one able to accurately "predict" who would be selected was an American, George
  Williams, head of Harvard Divinity School. His intimate knowledge of the inner workings
  of the Vatican and his personal association with the Polish prelate can be presumed to
  have stimulated his "clairvoyance."</p>

  <p>Thus the centuries-old tradition of selecting an Italian pope was breached not
  because of creative, innovative, and imaginative ideas coming out of the College of
  Cardinals, but because of the severe pressure of U.S. finance capital.</p>

  <h4>A PROFOUNDLY POLITICAL ORGANIZATION</h4>

  <p>One of the most pervasive myths regarding the Catholic Church is that its sole
  purpose is "to tend to the spiritual needs of the people." In reality the Church is,
  and for most of its existence has always been, a profoundly political organization.</p>

  <p>Another myth, no less pervasive than the first one, is that the Church is "above the
  battle" in regard to the class struggle. The truth of the matter, however, is that the
  Church has always been allied with, or an instrument of, one or the other of the
  possessing classes.</p>

  <p>During the medieval period and up to the advance of the bourgeoisie it was allied
  with the landlords against the peasants enslaved as serfs. With the advance of the
  bourgeois social order and the rising might of the capitalist class, the Church and the
  ecclesiastical order came under sharp fire from the ideologists and politicians of the
  new possessing class.</p>

  <p>When classical feudalism was overthrown, the Church slowly veered toward and was
  finally won over to the bourgeoisie. From then on it became an ideological and
  political defender of the new ruling class. It has been a reactionary opponent of
  liberal elements in the bourgeoisie, however.</p>

  <p>At other times it has been involved in inter-ruling class struggles: how best to
  deceive the masses; how best to hold them in subjection; how to teach the masses
  humility and submission in the face of the aggressiveness and growing might of the
  giant industrialists and financiers.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to weigh the significance of the new Vatican selection without
  taking into account these pertinent historical facts for it may have far-reaching
  importance in the world struggle of the imperialist ruling classes against the workers,
  the oppressed people, and the socialist countries.</p>

  <h4>A MOVE IN THE NEW COLD WAR?</h4>

  <p>The bourgeois press of the West, particularly that of the U.S., has literally pulled
  out all stops in praise of the Vatican's new selection to head the papacy. Much of the
  ruling class press has indulged in broad speculation on how the new Polish Pope will
  deal with Eastern Europe and the West European Communist parties.</p>

  <p>Some regard the selection of Pope John Paul II as nothing less than a coup, a stroke
  of genius which will do much to dismantle and destroy the fragile socialist foundations
  in Eastern Europe via a "revitalized" and "vibrant" Church aided by new inspiration
  from the Vatican. Like many other diplomatic and political maneuvers of imperialism
  since the end of World War II and the emergence of socialist regimes in Eastern Europe,
  this one, contrary to the expectations of the capitalist press, may fall wide of the
  mark.</p>

  <p>It is also possible that the Vatican, in its attempt to overreach itself and in its
  haste to do the bidding of international finance capital, will meet unexpected
  resistance.</p>

  <p>There is no question, however, that in the worldwide struggle between imperialism
  and the socialist camp Eastern Europe is vulnerable to imperialist
  penetration-economically politically and ideologically. And this is probably more true
  of Poland than other socialist countries.</p>

  <h4>FEUDALISM LINGERED IN EASTERN EUROPE</h4>

  <p>In Western Europe the bourgeoisie, when it was a revolutionary class in the
  eighteenth century, did much to undermine and expose the reactionary character of the
  Church and to combat religion in general. This was part of its progressive role in
  carrying out the tasks of the bourgeois revolution. "In the West," said Lenin, "this
  task was to a large extent performed or tackled by bourgeois democracy in the epoch of
  its revolution. In Russia," he continued, "because of the conditions of our
  bourgeois-democratic revolution, this task falls almost entirely on the shoulders of
  the working class." (Lenin's <em>"Attitude of the Workers' Party Towards
  Religion,"</em> May 1909.)</p>

  <p>What Lenin said about Russia in general applied even more so to Eastern Europe. The
  bourgeois revolution was never consummated in Eastern Europe. The landed gentry,
  especially the big landlords, in union with the Church held complete sway over the
  masses. The rising bourgeoisie in Eastern Europe was only too glad to join the
  landlords and the Church and perpetuate an unholy trinity of exploitation, oppression,
  and ignorance over the masses.</p>

  <p>It is to be remembered that it was only by virtue of Napoleon's armies that
  feudalism in its classical form was abolished in some parts of Eastern Europe. But
  basically the class structure and the political weight of the ecclesiastical
  authorities remained a heavy weight on the shoulders of all of society and it was only
  in the wake of the October Revolution that attempts to overcome it by revolutionary
  measures were taken. Unfortunately, they floundered under the prevailing difficult
  conditions.</p>

  <p>The early Polish Marxists of Rosa Luxemburg's era, and later the Communist Party of
  the early 1920s, fought splendidly as the vanguard of the proletarian struggle in
  Poland.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they too were not equal to the tasks imposed by the severe conditions
  of their time. Moreover, they did not avail themselves in time of the rich experience
  of Leninist strategy and tactics to promote the proletarian class struggle. This was
  especially true of Luxemburg who disregarded Lenin's teachings on the national question
  and defied his position on self-determination.</p>

  <p>The liberation of Poland from the Nazi invasion unleashed by Hitler was accomplished
  in the main by the revolutionary intervention of the Soviet armed forces. The
  resistance of the Polish people against the Nazi invasion was strong, formidable, and
  heroic. But it was an auxiliary force to the main element in breaking the back of
  Hitler's invasion, which was the Soviet Red Army.</p>

  <h4>POSTWAR PROBLEMS</h4>

  <p>That would not in any way have militated against the healthy construction of a
  socialist state had this been done in the spirit of revolutionary class struggle, in
  the spirit of awakening and stimulating mass working class and peasant initiative, had
  free rein been given to the creative forces inherent in the proletariat and their
  peasant allies in the struggle against the sinister forces of bourgeois reaction.</p>

  <p>However, the intervention of the Soviet forces was carried out in a
  military-bureaucratic fashion which tended to stifle initiative, especially of the
  workers and peasants. Moreover, the liberation was carried out in the spirit of
  compromise with Western imperialism which laid claim to Poland as part of the "free
  world," a claim which it has never renounced to this day.</p>

  <p>If anything at all it inhibited the revolutionary process in Poland and gave a
  longer lease on life to the forces of bourgeois reaction under the cloak of religion
  and in the form of the Church hierarchy, it was the continuous compromising with the
  West in an effort to make the new Poland look "democratic" in the bourgeois sense of
  the word. Only history will be able to tell to what extent such compromises were
  necessary if at all.</p>

  <p>Thus a large residue of reaction remained untouched during the entire course of the
  Liberation and the revolutionary struggle against the old regime in Poland. It was not
  the kind of thorough-going revolutionary class struggle which, if once unleashed, has
  the potential of making a clean sweep and a final reckoning with the bourgeoisie and
  its allies. Purely administrative and arbitrary measures unrelated to the mass struggle
  were taken from above, especially against clerical authorities, and had the effect of
  antagonizing large sections of the rural population and some sections of the urban
  population. In any case, they proved ineffective, and served to strengthen reaction and
  encourage international finance capital to make more and more inroads.</p>

  <h4>REACTION EXPRESSED THROUGH THE CHURCH</h4>

  <p>The Church became the principal bastion and rallying ground for bourgeois and
  reactionary elements. When the uprising of 1956 occurred, it made retreat by the
  socialist government inevitable in many fields.</p>

  <p>Most significantly, the retreat in agriculture from collective farming back to
  bourgeois individual farming, which today accounts for as much as 90% of agricultural
  production in Poland, gave the Church a tremendous opportunity to ingratiate itself
  with the rural population and the peasants in particular.</p>

  <p>The Church now regards itself as the defender of the rights of the peasantry, when
  in reality its interest is to defend and expand the rights of the rural bourgeois
  elements, the new petty-bourgeois independent artisans in the urban centers, and a good
  part of the disloyal and disaffected elements in the state and party apparatus.</p>

  <p>Since the 1956 rebellion, all the efforts of succeeding socialist administrations to
  accommodate with the West and grant more and more concessions to the Catholic hierarchy
  have served to embolden domestic reaction and its imperialist masters abroad. At the
  same time this has continually weakened the socialist foundations of the country,
  notwithstanding tremendous technological and industrial progress as well as very
  substantial improvements in the standard of living of the broad mass of the people.</p>

  <p>It should be remembered that the Catholic hierarchy, having become a legally
  recognized entity in Poland, demagogically appropriates all the improvements made in
  the living conditions of the mass of the people to its credit while at the same time it
  carries on an underground war of obstruction to socialist construction.</p>

  <p>Twenty thousand priests for a country with less than 35 million people! What does
  this mean in a socialist country like Poland? It means 20,000 full-time political
  activists, cadres, against socialist construction in general and Marxist-Leninist
  ideology in particular. The clerical bureaucracy grows stronger and more numerous every
  day and consumes an ever larger portion of the gross national product of socialist
  construction. All this has emboldened the Vatican to take the plunge which it did in
  naming Cardinal Karol Wojtyla as Pope John Paul II.</p>

  <p>While some in the bourgeois press present the new Pope as a pragmatist and
  conciliator in matters relating to the socialist countries and the international
  workers' movement, others see him as a hard-line anti-communist more likely to seek
  confrontation with the Polish government rather than conciliation. At any rate, it is
  interesting to note that the ultra-rightists in the U.S., such as the industrialist
  James Buckley, former U.S. Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan of New York, and
  Carter's "National Security" adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, were quick to see the
  political aspects of the papal selection, particularly as it refers to Eastern Europe
  and communism in general.</p>

  <h4>REACTION OF POLISH GOVERNMENT</h4>

  <p>The worst aspect of all this for all genuine communists concerned with the struggle
  for socialism is the initial reaction of the Polish government itself. It is
  understandable that for the moment at least both the party and the government may be in
  a defensive position in the light of the Vatican. imperialist maneuver of selecting a
  Polish prelate as Pope, and the nationalist frenzy that the imperialist press is trying
  to create by flattering the Polish people with the selection.</p>

  <p>(Of course, the Vatican would never have thought of a Polish citizen even as
  doorkeeper at the time Hitler's hordes were subjugating Poland. But why would the
  imperialist press remember anything like that?).</p>

  <p>No less than Edward Gierek himself, the First Secretary of the Party, sent a
  congratulatory message to the new Pope. He said, "We express our conviction that the
  election of the new Pope will contribute to the further development of relations
  between Poland and the Vatican."</p>

  <p>However, at a mass attended by some 5,000 people in Krakow, one of the city's
  bishops prayed for "God to grant the church in Poland the struggle for human rights,"
  which is a way of throwing down the gauntlet to the government. Clearly this bishop
  doesn't see the "development of relations" the way Gierek does.</p>

  <p>The whole business of dealing with the Vatican, of recognizing it as a diplomatic
  power, and the way the party deals with the Church and religion in general is in
  complete contradiction to the Leninist conception of the struggle.</p>

  <p>In May 1909 when the political reaction following the defeat of the 1905 revolution
  was still relatively strong but running out of steam and the forces of clerical
  obscurantism had raised their head, Lenin took time off to write an article critical of
  a speech made by a Bolshevik deputy in the Duma. The article is pertinent to the
  present course of the Polish CP leadership.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"By declaring from the Duma tribune that religion is the opium of the people,"
    Lenin says, "our fraction [the Bolsheviks] acted quite correctly, and thus created a
    precedent which should serve as a basis for all utterances by Russian
    Social-Democrats on the question of religion. Should they have gone further and
    developed their atheistic arguments in greater detail? We think not. This might have
    incurred the danger of the fight against religion being exaggerated by the political
    party of the proletariat; it might have resulted in obliterating the difference
    between the bourgeois and the Socialist fight against religion. The first duty of the
    Social Democratic fraction in the Black Hundred Duma has been discharged with
    honor.</p>

    <p>"The second duty," Lenin 'continues, "and perhaps the most important for
    Social-Democrats &mdash; namely to explain the class role of the church and the
    clergy in supporting the Black Hundred government and the bourgeoisie in its fight
    against the working class &mdash; has also been discharged with honor. Of course,
    very much more might be said on this subject. ..."</p>

    <p>"The third duty," Lenin goes on to say, "was to explain in full detail the
    <strong>correct</strong> meaning of the proposition so often distorted by the German
    opportunists, namely that 'religion is a private matter.' This, unfortunately,
    Comrade Surkov did not do."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h4>RELIGION A 'PRIVATE AFFAIR'</h4>

  <p>What Surkov should have made clear, Lenin said elsewhere, was that "religion should
  be a private affair as far as the state is concerned, but under no circumstance can we
  regard religion as a private affair as far as our own party is concerned. The state
  must not be concerned with religion, religious societies should have no connection with
  the state power. Everybody must be absolutely free to profess any religion he pleases
  or not to believe in any religion at all that is to be an atheist, as every Socialist
  usually is."</p>

  <p>Now, no one would expect Gierek, when called upon for a statement on the selection
  of the Pope, to carry out the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist position which Surkov did
  so splendidly by comparison in his first two duties &mdash; explaining that religion is
  the <strong>opium of the people</strong> and explaining the <strong>class role</strong>
  of the church and the clergy. Indeed it would be surprising in the light of the current
  situation to expect him to take a revolutionary position on these two highly critical
  and sensitive issues, which were no less critical and sensitive in 1909 for Deputy
  Surkov in the reactionary Black Hundred (Ku Klux Klan) Duma.</p>

  <p>But the least he could have done was to make the "mistake" that Surkov did, by
  asserting that insofar as the Pope's selection is a religious matter, it is a private
  affair. And he could have added that insofar as it is <strong>politically</strong>
  motivated, the Polish government will resist any attempts by foreign powers to
  interfere in the internal affairs of Poland. However, to have sent a congratulatory
  message was to <strong>validate</strong> brazen imperialist interference.</p>

  <p>Gierek might just have said, "Religion is a private matter," when asked about the
  selection of the Pope. Although it would not have satisfied Leninist standards of
  communist conduct in relation to the papacy, it at least would have shown a slight
  contempt for an antediluvian institution which parades around as a world authority on
  moral and ethical affairs when in reality it is merely an instrumentality of
  international finance capital.</p>

  <p>In this role the papacy is a reactionary force not only against Polish socialism but
  against the worldwide struggle of the working class and the oppressed.</p>

  <h4>'ADAPTABILITY' TO NEW RULING CLASS</h4>

  <p>There is a significant current of political thought, both in the Western CPs as well
  as in the summits of some of the ruling parties in Eastern Europe, which holds to the
  thesis that coexistence with the Catholic hierarchy and with elements of the
  bourgeoisie make a peaceful evolution into socialism possible. With respect to the
  Catholic Church, they may well say that the Church, as we pointed out earlier, was an
  instrument or ally of previous ruling classes and that it had shown an ability to adapt
  itself to new conditions.</p>

  <p>This current of political thought overlooks the fact that the Catholic Church as a
  social and political phenomenon adapted itself to and became an instrument of
  <strong>possessing, exploiting, and oppressing classes,</strong> not of the
  dispossessed, oppressed, and exploited. Moreover, it completely disregards the growing
  acuteness of the worldwide struggle, the increasing aggressiveness and brazenness of
  imperialism, with <strong>its</strong> inability to accommodate itself or adjust itself
  to the peaceful transformation of capitalist society into socialism.</p>

  <p>Whichever way one looks at it, a showdown between the forces that are genuinely
  struggling for socialism, to fully transform Poland into a socialist society, and the
  regressive forces of bourgeois reaction, hidden as well as open, will ultimately become
  inevitable. The destiny not only of Poland but of Eastern Europe and other socialist
  countries is tied to the outcome of this struggle.</p>

  <p>Unquestionably the ongoing world struggle between imperialism on the one hand and
  the socialist countries, the world working class, and the liberation movements on the
  other will in no small measure contribute to the outcome.</p>
