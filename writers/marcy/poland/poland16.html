  <h3>Poland, in Bid for Loan, Will. Let<br />
  West's Banks Monitor Economy</h3>

  <h4>By Ann Crittenden</h4>
  <pre>
As part of an effort to obtain a major
new loan, Poland has agreed to permit
Western banks to monitor its economic
policies, American bankers say. They
regard the concession as a historic
breakthrough in financial relations
with the Communist world.
<br />The loan, now being arranged by a
group of Western banks, is essential if
Poland, the most heavily indebted
Communist country after the Soviet
Union, is to meet the payments due on
nearly $15 billion in debt to the West.
</pre>

  <h4>New Information Provided</h4>
  <pre>
To persuade the banks to agree to the
financing, Poland has already had to
announce a strict new budget for 1979
and provide its creditors with 
comprehensive new information
on its financial situation.
<br />Moreover, the banks involved in the
new credit will henceforth track the
progress of the Polish economy, much
as the International Monetary Fund
monitors the economies of 
non-Communist countries in financial
distress. An initial meeting between
Western bankers and Polish officials to
discuss Poland's economic program
and the pending loan, possibly 
involving up to $500 million, took
place in Warsaw two weeks ago.
<br />A spokesman at the Polish Consulate 
in Washington confirmed that the
country's private creditors would
monitor its economic progress in 
connection with the new loan,
which is in the final 
stages of negotiation, and on
future credits as they are required.
<br />Poland's supplying of data was 
expected to set a precedent that
other Communist-bloc nations 
would eventually have to follow. The Polish
developments were also seen as 
advancing the meshing of the economies
of Eastern Europe and the West.
<br />Representatives of 14 banks met
with Polish financial officials to 
discuss the country's economy
and to be invited to arrange the new 
financing at the initial meeting on Jan. 11. 
Those attending included representatives of
the Bank of America, Citibank, the
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company,
the Bankers Trust Company, the
Chemical Bank, the First National
Bank of Chicago, the Security Pacific
National Bank, the Bank of Montreal
and the National Westminster Bank of
Britain.
<br />"We didn't have a blueprint for the
Polish economy to follow," said one
banker involved in the financing, "but
we made it clear that belt-tightening
was a prerequisite for any new 
credits." The meetings with Polish
officials," he added, "give Western 
capitalists a certain say in
how the Poles proceed. 
The purpose of the economic 
monitoring will be to make sure that 
Poland follows policies that do not
imperil its debt-servicing capacities.
<br />Most observers believe that the
Bank Handlowy, Poland's foreign
trade bank, will be able to obtain a
commitment for at least $300 million
to $350 million of the $500 million that
it is trying to borrow. This would be
enough to forestall an immediate
financial crisis. In large part this is
because the Polish Government has
adopted a stringent new budget for
1979, sharply curbing domestic 
investment and emphasizing export
earnings needed to service 
the foreign debt.
</pre>

  <h4>Embracing of Austerity Cited</h4>
  <pre>
"This marks the first time a Communist 
government has embraced austerity 
 &mdash;  a purposeful cut in its planned
rate of growth  &mdash;  for balance-of-payments 
reasons," said Lawrence J. Brainard, 
an economist with Bankers Trust.
<br />Poland is not a member of the 
International Monetary Fund which
is the agency that imposes and 
monitors economic stabilization 
plans for non-Communist countries 
experiencing balance-of-payments 
difficulties. But
Poland's heavy dependence on 
Western credit led it to set up
a similar program of economic 
stringency that will be monitored, 
not by the I.M.F, but directly 
by its bank creditors.
<br />In addition, the banks have already
been given new data on the Polish
economy, including figures on total
foreign debt and debt repayment
schedules and a breakdown of 
the balance-of-payments deficit.
Much of this information had 
earlier been given to the United 
States Government in connection 
with the official loans made to
the Poles, but with the understanding
that it would not be shown to private
lenders.
<br />Some bankers believe that, because
the normally secretive Poles have had
to open their books to the banks, other
Communist-bloc countries will 
eventually have to do the same.
Once the Polish data is out, 
others will probably have to 
follow," said Gabriel Eichler, 
a specialist on Eastern Europe 
for the Bank of America.
<br />From a wider perspective, 
developments in Poland mark a 
further step in the integration 
of the economies of Eastern 
Europe with those of the West.
The trend has obvious political 
as well as economic implications. 
On the one hand as part of the 
tight, Western approved budget 
the Poles are freezing their 
military expenditures despite
Soviet requests for a rise in 
arms outlays by all Warsaw 
Pact countries.
<br />On the other hand, some bankers
speculate that the Soviet Union might
quietly welcome the discipline being
imposed on its Polish ally. If the Poles
get their economic house in order, they
will be that much less likely to turn for
help to the Russians, who have already
provided Poland with substantial 
economic assistance.
<br />The evolution of Eastern Europe toward 
the capitalist West is a direct 
result of the mounting debt 
accumulated by the Communist-bloc
countries in recent years. In the 
five years from 1974 through 
1978, this debt rose from about 
$13 billion to about $55 billion.
More than 60 percent of these credits
were extended by commercial banks,
which in comparison hold about 43
percent of the debt of the 
non-oil producing developing 
countries.
</pre>

  <h4>Cut Into Export Earnings</h4>
  <pre>
This unusual flow of capital 
occurred partly because of the 
Western recession, which cut heavily 
into East European export earnings 
needed to finance planned imports. 
The Cornmunist-bloc countries were also 
hard hit by the rising price of 
fuel and other raw materials, and a 
series of poor harvests in the 
mid-1970's.
<br />As these problems multiplied, only
the Soviet Union borrowed as heavily
as Poland, the 10th-largest industrial
country in the world. By the end of last
year, Poland had built up long-term
debt of $14.8 billion plus an estimated
$2 billion more in short-term credits of
less than one year.
<br />West Germany and Britain are 
Poland's major creditors; the total 
United States exposure in the
Communist nation is about 1.9 billion
including about $1.24 billion in debt 
held by American banks, some $500 
million in credits from the Commodity 
Credit Corporation for grain 
purchases, and about 175 million 
from the Export-Import Bank.
<br />Most of the private loans were 
made from 1974 to 1976, the year 
in which Poland's current 
account deficit peaked at $3.2 
billion. Both the current account 
and trade deficits have been 
decreasing, to $2 billion and 
$1.5 billion, respectively,
last year.
</pre>

  <h4>Repayment a Heavy Burden</h4>
  <pre>
But repayment obligations on the
debt incurred a few years ago are also
at a peak and will continue to place a
heavy burden on the nation for several
more years.
<br />This year bankers estimate that Poland 
will have to pay some $1 billion in
interest alone not counting 
repayments of principal. Moreover, 
payments of roughly this
level will continue for years.
<br />The Poles, told in effect by the
Western banks that they had to tighten
their belts, responded with a fiscal
program designed to put their trade
back in rough balance by 1980. The
1979 budget, announced in December,
called for a 10 percent reduction in
investment and tight controls on imports. 
It is expected to cut economic
growth in half this year.
<br />Expenditures on consumer subsidies,
on such items as food, health, and housing 
on the other hand will amount to
fully 40 percent of the budget. The
Polish Government led by 
Edward Gierek is is well aware 
that an austerity program 
in 1970 brought down the regime 
of his predecessor as Communist 
Party chief, Wladislaw Gomulka, and
that a sharp increase in food 
prices in 1976 brought riots and 
the near collapse of his own Government.
