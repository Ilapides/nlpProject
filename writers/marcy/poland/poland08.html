  <title>Poland: Behind the Crisis (1982) : A SETBACK FOR THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION</title>

  <h5>Poland: Behind the Crisis [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>A setback for the counter-revolution</h1>

  <p>JANUARY 19, 1982</p>

  <p>It should now be obvious, five weeks after the military takeover in Poland, that the
  imperialist bourgeoisie has suffered a major international defeat in its effort to
  provoke a counter-revolution.</p>

  <p>The counter-revolution has been repulsed and an early comeback seems hardly possible
  at this time.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie, particularly the U.S. ruling class, is severely disappointed and in
  a state of shock. Instead of celebrating the victory they had hoped for, they are in a
  state of mourning and have begun quarreling among themselves.</p>

  <p>The bankers especially are conducting an acrimonious war among themselves on what to
  do with the extortionate debts they had foisted upon the Polish people.</p>

  <p>For the first time since the institution of martial law, Poland has disappeared from
  the major headlines in the U.S. press and been relegated to the inside pages.</p>

  <p>At the January 19, 1982 press conference, which was billed as an important one since
  it would mark a year of Reagan's tenure, there were as many as 15 questions addressed
  to Reagan. Only one was on Poland. The president's remarks could scarcely be regarded
  as eventful.</p>

  <h4>A MAJOR SETBACK</h4>

  <p>Although the ruling class is still reeling under the severity of the setback, they
  have not stopped scheming and plotting. They may be regrouping and taking stock of the
  situation. For the moment, however, they have stopped the hysterical headlines and wild
  speculation.</p>

  <p>The lifting of censorship by the Polish authorities has made it impossible to
  fabricate and manufacture horror stories of torture, imprisonment, and the like. But
  the fact that the ruling class has pulled back in its hysteria does not necessarily
  mean that the White House and Pentagon have given up their adventure in Poland.</p>

  <p>They have been severely inhibited by the failure of the imperialist allies to jump
  at the crack of the U.S. whip. Their most important ideological weapon &mdash;
  red-baiting and anti-Sovietism &mdash; has taken its toll in the working class and to a
  lesser extent among the oppressed peoples. But it is beginning to wane and may peter
  out after a period of time.</p>

  <p>The counter-revolution in Poland, they had fancied, would succeed by the slow,
  gradual penetration of finance capital and the step-by-step takeover of the
  administrative economic and political organs of the state. These hopes have been
  shattered.</p>

  <h4>WALL STREET JOURNAL ANALYZES SOLIDARITY DEFEAT</h4>

  <p>The <em>Wall Street Journal,</em> the mouthpiece of high finance and big business
  that poses as a stalwart champion of the working class in Poland, has attempted to sum
  up the situation from its own class point of view. Having more or less anticipated an
  easy victory, it feels most obliged to go over the events in a critical manner to find
  out just what went wrong.</p>

  <p>"The popular wisdom in the West," the <em>Journal</em> says on January 19, 1982,
  "was always that it would take Soviet troops to crush the 10 million-strong Solidarity
  union. Certainly the Poles themselves wouldn't act against an organization which was
  essentially the expression of their own national will. ...</p>

  <p>"The actuality has been quite different. Not only was it Polish soldiers and police
  who carried out the destruction of Solidarity, but they did it against only scattered
  and occasional resistance."</p>

  <p>The <em>Journal</em> goes on to moan about "the movement that once sought nothing
  short of a reordering of Polish society" [the restoration of capitalism &mdash; SM].
  "One must wonder," asks the <em>Journal,</em> "why Poles didn't fight en masse for
  Solidarity? Why were Polish special police and soldiers willing to act against a
  movement that appeared to be so popular?"</p>

  <p>In the first place, as the <em>Journal</em> well-nigh admits, it was not that
  popular. The <em>Journal</em> berates the Western capitalist press for reporting only
  "the euphoria surrounding the union's birth but was remiss in chronicling" later
  events.</p>

  <p>"Solidarity," says the <em>Journal,</em> "had slowly changed from a glittering
  symbol of Polish hope to just another expression of Polish frustration." Why?</p>

  <h4>WORKERS AGAINST SABOTAGING ECONOMY</h4>

  <p>Solidarity had nothing to offer by way of real, genuine change in a progressive,
  working-class direction.</p>

  <p>The constant and utterly irresponsible, uninterrupted calls for strike after strike
  without any rhyme or reason were aimed by the leaders at destabilizing and sabotaging
  the economy. It made inevitable a catastrophic decline in production and the
  availability of the most vital necessities.</p>

  <p>Disillusionment and disenchantment were therefore inevitable despite the growing
  extremes to which the reactionary leadership was heading politically. There was a
  growing alienation of the rank and file from the reactionary Solidarity leadership.</p>

  <p>The "glitter" came when millions of workers more or less spontaneously joined in the
  struggle for economic demands in the very early period. But the reactionary leadership
  which had wormed its way into the workers' movement captured it at a historic moment in
  the life of Poland and began to turn it in a pro-imperialist direction.</p>

  <p>As the <em>Journal</em> puts it, "Without the obvious presence of Soviet soldiers in
  Poland there was little to unify the resistance. In other words the economic grievances
  of the workers, the dislocation of the economy, its destabilization, and sabotage
  &mdash; those were not factors that could unify resistance.</p>

  <p>The economic condition of the workers is what motivated them. What motivated the
  leadership was the constant projection of anti-Soviet chimeras. This is a complete
  dichotomy between the leaders and the led.</p>

  <p>The leaders had in mind an anti-communist and anti-Soviet struggle with which they
  could confuse the masses. But they could not lead them into a direct struggle for power
  against the state.</p>

  <p>Thus, without Soviet intervention they couldn't possibly evoke the much hoped for
  insurrection. The truth of the matter is that they couldn't even evoke a general strike
  &mdash; not only against martial law but even earlier. A month earlier, the projection
  of a general strike, the leaders quickly learned, was met with dismay and
  discouragement in most industrial areas in Poland.</p>

  <p>Destabilization of the economy and outright economic sabotage by Solidarity's
  leaders could not only fail to retain the "glitter," but failed to generate enthusiasm
  for it.</p>

  <h4>IMPERIALIST MISCALCULATION</h4>

  <p>The bourgeoisie, who had been swallowing their own propaganda as the
  <em>Journal</em> here admits, had really begun to picture the situation in Poland in a
  sort of classical reversal of the October Russian Revolution, where the militarist
  Kornilov attempted with military rule to crush a revolutionary working class and
  peasantry.</p>

  <p>By projecting this scene onto Poland (and changing what has to be changed to fit
  Polish circumstances) the bourgeoisie imagined that when the military announced martial
  law, Solidarity's call for a general strike within two days would come off with a bang.
  Millions would not only stop work but would come out into the streets in defiance of
  military orders.</p>

  <p>The streets o Warsaw and Cracow and everywhere else would be filled with workers
  waving anti-government banners and slogans. The military and the police would then open
  fire and the workers would either overwhelm them or the military rank and file would
  join them, along with the officers, and fraternize with the workers.</p>

  <p>Together they would storm the headquarters of the government and the Communist Party
  and reestablish a capitalist state.</p>

  <p>All of this would happen with a joyous population fraternizing with the military
  which at last would demonstrate that they and Solidarity were all together.</p>

  <p>But nothing like this happened, as the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> unhappily
  admits.</p>

  <p>It was a fantasy. It was based on more than an illusion. It had its origins in a
  basic miscalculation of the class character of the Polish state even as it was rapidly
  having the ground torn from under it.</p>

  <h4>CLASS CHARACTER OF POLISH STATE</h4>

  <p>Why did the army take it upon itself to intervene?</p>

  <p>Because the civil authorities, who were charged with governing and administering the
  workers state, were crumbling, disintegrating, and many in reality were secretly aiding
  and abetting the destabilization and sabotage of the economy and colluding with
  pro-imperialist elements.</p>

  <p>The chaos and destabilization were not the products of an organic development
  growing out of the automatic processes of the economy, although the latter was badly
  managed and woefully inefficient.</p>

  <p>Complete chaos would have eventually enveloped the entire country and made a
  complete takeover by the counterrevolution absolutely inevitable. It was therefore the
  duty and the obligation of the armed forces as one of the principal pillars of the
  workers' state in Poland to boldly intervene and repulse if not completely crush the
  counter-revolution.</p>

  <p>It should be added that the army takeover was done in a wholly constitutional manner
  in accordance with the laws of the Polish Constitution. The civil authorities had
  granted all authority to the council of state, of which Jaruzelski was designated the
  head, and approved the imposition of martial law. He had previously been designated
  prime minister, chairman of the party, and defense minister.</p>

  <p>It was not a coup but an assumption &mdash; by voluntary consent of the civilian
  authorities &mdash; of urgently needed authority to repulse the counter-revolution
  which the civil officialdom was both unwilling and incapable of dealing with. There is
  no contradiction whatever with a principled working-class approach in this problem.</p>

  <p>The validity of an army takeover of an incompetent or disintegrating workers'
  government which cannot cope with the problems of counter-revolution flows out of
  historic necessity given the confluence of circumstances of the struggle between
  imperialism and the socialist countries as a whole.</p>

  <h4>MILITARY AS ORGANIZER AND EDUCATOR</h4>

  <p>The Soviet Union in its very early days, when it was led by Lenin, was obliged to
  dispatch its armed forces to crush the Kronstadt uprising which, incidentally, was led
  by ultra-leftist elements. This last fact did not at all militate against the uprising
  being characterized as a counter-revolutionary thrust which would have the effect of
  overthrowing the newly established Bolshevik government.</p>

  <p>The armies of both the Soviet Union and China have played more than the role of
  defender of the workers' government from external aggression or counter-revolutionary
  insurrection. They have also served, and rather splendidly, as educators and organizers
  in the struggle to bring victory to the revolution and in socialist construction.</p>

  <p>These attributes cannot be found in armies under the control of imperialist powers.
  Wherever and whenever the Polish Army, even in a modest and token way, recently
  assisted in, the distribution and allocation of food as well as organization in the
  countryside, it conducted itself with dignity, sensitivity, and firmness.</p>

  <h4>COMPARISON WITH BOURGEOIS MILITARY</h4>

  <p>Of course, both capitalist and socialist armies have certain external
  characteristics that are common to both. They are based, however, on diametrically
  opposed classes. One protects the exploiters, which the imperialists invariably are,
  while the socialist army protects and defends the interests of the working class and
  the peasantry.</p>

  <p>The fact that the workers have become disoriented, misled, and thrown into a state
  of total confusion and chaos while the civilian leaders are in disarray, is at least
  one factor among others which may alert the military to a possible need for a takeover.
  When the situation continues to rapidly deteriorate, and the civilian leaders conduct a
  relentless undercover war among themselves about issues not clear to the masses and not
  defined in class terms, and these leaders become more helpless every day, this only
  makes it more necessary for the military authorities, who are clear about the dangerous
  course of events, to take the appropriate measures necessary to save the progressive
  gains of socialist construction and to help in reconstructing the state itself.</p>

  <p>On how many occasions has a bourgeois army leadership saved the neck of the
  bourgeoisie when it has become rent by severe contradictions and is under revolutionary
  pressure of the workers?</p>

  <p>In modern imperialist France under Charles de Gaulle, its most outstanding military
  leader, the 1968 wave of general strikes augured well for the development of a
  genuinely revolutionary situation.</p>

  <p>It was de Gaulle, in his role as military chieftain of the French imperialist
  bourgeoisie, who ostentatiously went to West Germany in a counter-revolutionary threat
  to bring the French military divisions stationed in Germany (and under fascist
  leadership) back to France to threaten a counter-revolutionary bloodbath. It was this
  fascist threat which forced the Communist Party and social democratic leaders to
  quickly capitulate.</p>

  <p>The army reflects the class structure of society in general. And in Poland in
  particular, where conscription is universal, the rank and file is composed of workers
  and peasants, mostly peasants.</p>

  <p>The officer corps itself is mostly drawn from the ranks of the workers, especially
  the younger ones. The older ones are veterans in the struggle against the Nazi
  invaders. It is, of course, no secret that the army leadership has been trained and
  equipped for many years by the Soviet Union. This the imperialist bourgeoisie well
  knew.</p>

  <p>The imperialist bourgeoisie reckoned that by penetration and subversion they had won
  over many of the civil organs of state, or so they believed. And believing their own
  propaganda regarding the popularity of Solidarity, they hastened to conclude that the
  army rank and file and the leadership would side with the counter-revolution.</p>

  <h4>ARMY VIEW OF INDEPENDENT POLAND</h4>

  <p>They therefore totally disregarded what one of their principal mentors and foreign
  commentators of an earlier age said during World War II. Walter Lippmann clearly
  foresaw why the army as a whole and especially its leadership would not side with or
  tolerate a counter-revolution: "There could be no future for a Poland governed or even
  influenced by those Poles who ... conceived themselves as the spearpoint of a hostile
  coalition against the Soviet Union."</p>

  <p>There is no question that the Solidarity leadership was a rabidly anti-Soviet and
  pro-imperialist instrument. Under certain unfortunate circumstances, where a corrupt
  political leadership of the state and the party had neglected its socialist and
  working-class obligations, this pro-imperialist instrument captured a formidable
  section of the working class.</p>

  <p>Yes, the army leadership, it can now be said, fully understood that there was no
  future for a truly independent Poland in becoming a spearpoint or a satellite for the
  imperialist West. That is a cardinal fact which could not but loom large in the
  calculations of the military leadership.</p>

  <p>Intervention by the army is the last resort in periods of political crisis, both for
  a bourgeois state as well as a workers' state. Although the Polish economy had
  increasingly come under the thumb of the imperialist West and the political leadership
  of the workers was rapidly disintegrating, the one firm pillar of the state &mdash; the
  armed forces &mdash; remained loyal to the cause of socialism and against imperialist
  enslavement.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie had miscalculated in the sense that they had equated the Polish Army
  with a bourgeois army under imperialist domination. That was a howling blunder.</p>

  <h4>WHICH WAY FOR POLAND?</h4>

  <p>However, the case might have been different had the imperialists been slowly
  penetrating the military in the way they usually do in Third World countries. There
  they immediately try to establish contacts and exchanges with the military and thereby
  establish an ongoing relationship with them until the imperialist intelligence forces
  completely penetrate the military forces of the newly independent Third World
  countries. They are therefore in an advantageous position to subvert the military and
  overturn the governments as they have done in Ghana, Chile, Indonesia, Pakistan, and
  many, many others.</p>

  <p>From the point of view of imperialist economic penetration, Poland had achieved many
  of the characteristics of a neocolonialist regime under the aegis of imperialism.
  That's as far as it went.</p>

  <p>But, winning over or influencing any sections of the armed forces leadership or rank
  and file seems to have failed, at any rate up until now. Therein lay the Achilles heel
  of imperialist intervention.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois press boasted during Solidarity's heyday that Jaruzelski had refused
  in 1970 to send out the army to suppress the Gdansk workers. Gomulka, who was head of
  the Polish government at the time, then ordered the militia to do so, causing many
  deaths and casualties, which ultimately brought down his administration.</p>

  <p>If Jaruzelski, as alleged in the capitalist press, refused to send out the army when
  asked at that period in time, he did so wisely. The struggle by the workers was at that
  stage still only of a purely economic character. A counter-revolutionary leadership had
  not yet captured the workers' movement in Gdansk or anywhere else. It had just barely
  reared its head and saw fertile soil for demagogic agitation in order to divert the
  struggle from economic into politically counter-revolutionary channels.</p>

  <h4>COMPARISON WITH 1970</h4>

  <p>In 1970 it was purely an economic struggle and not a struggle directed against the
  socialist state. Even though there were as many as 70 fatalities at that time, the
  imperialist press, especially that of the U.S., scarcely took note of it.</p>

  <p>There were none of the howls about police brutality, no demands were made on the
  Gomulka government, no one proposed sanctions, no one demanded punishment. There were
  editorial comments calculated to discredit socialist forms of government, but there was
  no attempt either to magnify or utilize the events in an overt, hostile manner against
  the Polish regime, as the capitalist press of the world is doing now when the
  casualties are far less, 14 at most, and this with martial law throughout the whole
  country.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter is that at that time the bourgeoisie had not yet seen the
  full value of directing its forces into the workers' movement as one of the principal
  levers of subversion against the Polish state.</p>

  <p>After the ouster of Gomulka and during the succeeding administration of Gierek, the
  bourgeoisie confined itself to pressing for opening wide the gates of the Polish
  economy to imperialist finance capital, which it did with remarkable success and little
  opposition from any publicly known sources in Poland.</p>

  <p>From all this it should be clear that any military intervention in 1970 would have
  been premature and would have discredited the armed forces in the eyes of the
  workers.</p>

  <h4>TASK OF RECONSTRUCTION</h4>

  <p>It is too soon to say that the counter-revolution has been decisively crushed. It
  has merely been repulsed, silenced, and to some extent repressed.</p>

  <p>Now the important task before the Polish government is how soon it can, with the aid
  of its socialist allies, begin the work of reconstruction.</p>

  <p>Will the imperialist West, which has such a big stake in the Polish economy in the
  form of a tremendous indebtedness at the present time, permit the Polish government to
  proceed, without interference, to socialist construction? Or will the imperialists
  having recovered from the shock and disappointment, slowly regroup their forces for the
  next phase of the struggle?</p>

  <p>The struggle in Poland extends far beyond Poland itself. Poland is a link in the
  worldwide struggle of all the socialist countries and all the oppressed peoples against
  the plans for world domination by imperialism of which the U.S. is the principal
  proponent and promoter.</p>
