  <h5>Poland: Behind the Crisis [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Poland's struggle for independence</h1>

  <h4>DECEMBER 21, 1981</h4>

  <p>For longer than a century, the European people have been passionately devoted to the
  struggle for Polish independence.</p>

  <p>It was Karl Marx himself who in connection with his organizing effort for the North
  during the American Civil War, also organized a public meeting in Britain on behalf of
  Polish independence. This meeting was attended by many Polish workers and workers of
  other nationalities, especially from the London area.</p>

  <p>The Polish working class in Europe understood Polish independence one way.</p>

  <p>But the clamor for "independence" by the capitalist powers was something else
  again.</p>

  <p>When the German bourgeoisie spoke of Polish independence they had in mind an
  annexation of Poland. When the French bourgeoisie spoke of independence, they meant an
  alliance under which Poland would be subjugated and used as a battering ram against
  both the Germans and the Russians. And when the British spoke of independence they had
  in mind the extension of the British Empire to the gates of Warsaw.</p>

  <p>They haven't changed much at all today.</p>

  <p>It is no wonder that revolutionary Marxists have always been suspicious about the
  clamor for "Polish independence" when they see that its cheerleaders come from the
  Bourse, Lombard Street, and Wall Street.</p>

  <h4>ROLE OF POLISH ARMY</h4>

  <p>Of all the dramatic events arising out of the Polish situation, that which has
  surprised and stunned the bourgeoisie most is the fact that it was the Polish Army, not
  the Soviet Army as the capitalists had been predicting, which opened up the offensive
  against the counter-revolution.</p>

  <p>It also stunned the bourgeois elements in Poland. The <em>New York Times</em> on
  December 19, 1981, carries a Warsaw dispatch with a December 17, 1981, dateline by
  Henry Kamm, which states: "There were no Soviet tanks in Warsaw today. That, to many
  Poles, was the hardest thing to take about the crackdown which began Saturday."</p>

  <p>Why was it the Army that initiated and is carrying through the struggle against the
  counter-revolution, apparently without any visible opposition from within?</p>

  <p>Shouldn't the Army above all be in favor of an "independent" Poland as defined by
  Solidarity? Shouldn't the Army be for breaking its ties with the Warsaw Pact, and the
  Soviet Union in particular, and be "independent"?</p>

  <p>The answer to these questions is that the Army leadership has demonstrated that it
  understands the <strong>real</strong> meaning of independence for Poland.</p>

  <p>That was once understood here in this country among certain elements of the
  capitalist establishment. It was a short-lived period.</p>

  <p>That was around the time when the Soviet Red Army had just broken the back of the
  Nazi war machine and Poland was about to be fully liberated from the Nazi yoke. The
  question of the future of Eastern Europe was still considered an Eastern European and
  Soviet affair, in which negotiations would end with a peace treaty between East and
  West.</p>

  <p>The Yalta agreement, which came about a year later (1945), was considered to be such
  an agreement. It recognized the independence of Poland.</p>

  <h4>HOW LIPPMANN UNDERSTOOD POLISH INDEPENDENCE</h4>

  <p>One of those close to the U.S. State Department at the time and who best understood
  the real meaning of Polish independence was the well-known foreign affairs commentator
  and so-called dean of the U.S. journalistic community, Walter Lippmann. He was also an
  adviser to more than a half a dozen presidents, including Kennedy, Johnson, and
  Eisenhower.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, Lippmann was an able exponent of U.S. imperialist policy and
  reflected elements within the imperialist establishment.</p>

  <p>Ronald Steel, who has written the authoritative book on Lippmann <em>Walter Lippmann
  and the American Century</em> , had this to say about Lippmann's view on Poland:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Lippmann thought Prime Minister Churchill's plan for a pro-British government in
    Warsaw entirely fanciful. An independent Poland could survive 'only if it is allied
    with Russia,' he wrote as early as January 1944. If the Poles annex territory that
    was German [that territory was returned to Poland a decade later &mdash; SM] they
    would need outside help to hold on to that territory. Only Russia could provide
    that.</p>

    <p>"Therefore, he underlined, Poland had to come to terms with Russia, 'to terms
    which make Russia the principal guarantor of the Western boundary.' Stalin knew this,
    the Germans knew it, and so did the moderate [bourgeois &mdash; SM] Poles. There
    could be 'no future for a Poland governed or even influenced by those Poles who even
    before they are liberated from the Nazis conceived themselves as the spearpoint of a
    hostile coalition against the Soviet Union.' "</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>That's how it was understood for a short period in most of Europe and in the U.S.
  And that's how the Polish Army understands it today. It understands that there can be
  no guarantee for any real independence except, as Lippmann wrote, by alliance with the
  Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>The attempt by the U.S. government, in secret alliance with other imperialist
  powers, to influence, promote, and financially support "those Poles who conceived
  themselves as a spearpoint of a hostile coalition against the Soviet Union" is what
  lies at the bottom of the struggle between Western imperialism and the socialist
  countries, particularly Poland. It is the attempt by the U.S. and its imperialist
  allies, ever since the Polish People's Republic was established, to undermine and
  destabilize the Polish economy, undermine the state, nullify the Yalta agreement and
  reestablish Poland as a satellite of imperialism, particularly U.S. imperialism.</p>

  <p>What is happening now is in some ways a rerun, with far more serious international
  implications, of what happened after the death of Roosevelt the coming to power of the
  Truman administration the pronouncement of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan
  and the opening up of the vicious Cold War.</p>

  <h4>HOW THEY DESTABILIZED EARLY POLISH ECONOMY</h4>

  <p>The way the U.S. destabilization against Poland began is sometimes told in their own
  words, which are occasionally released in official documents of the U.S. In the State
  Department document entitled <em>1948 &mdash; Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union,
  Volume 4,</em> there is considerable material which indicates how the new post-Yalta
  policy of U.S. imperialism began to take shape.</p>

  <p>For instance, it says on page 528 that on March 26, 1948, "President Truman issued a
  proclamation which redefined arms and implements of war so as to include a category of
  exports which had not been subject to licensing control in 1947 and included categories
  of equipment previously not requiring clearance."</p>

  <p>This dealt with purchases by the Polish government of industrial equipment necessary
  to put the Polish coal industry back into operation following its destruction under
  Nazi rule.</p>

  <p>The U.S. government suspended the shipments even though Poland had already paid a
  considerable amount of money for them, which included a blooming mill, a slabbing mill
  and other equipment necessary for the coal industry. However, the U.S. government
  insisted on first settling the nationalization agreements with the Polish
  government.</p>

  <h4>U.S. 'LINKS' PURCHASES WITH NATIONALIZATIONS</h4>

  <p>The Polish government had said that the nationalizations, some of which included
  U.S. businesses, were another matter and should not be linked up with purchases of
  necessary equipment and technology which were made by other agreements. The Polish
  position was that the nationalizations were an internal affair.</p>

  <p>But the U.S. regarded the nationalization of industry in Poland, that is, the taking
  of the means of production into the hands of the state for purposes of socialist
  construction, and also the collectivization of the land, as "undemocratic" measures and
  opposed them.</p>

  <p>Its opposition took the form which was outlined in Truman's memorandum quoted above.
  In accordance with that directive, the U.S. put an embargo on most exports to Poland
  pending an agreement concerning the nationalizations of industry and finance,
  collectivization of the land, and other matters.</p>

  <p>This is the way the U.S. attempted to block Poland's progressive measures toward
  socialist construction. It abrogated agreements by which Poland was to purchase
  urgently needed technology to rebuild the devastated coal industry after the ravages of
  the Nazi invasion.</p>

  <h4>NICARAGUA AND POLAND</h4>

  <p>The reader should examine the current negotiations between the U.S. and Nicaragua
  and it will be easily seen that the U.S. is taking just about the same position in
  relation to Nicaragua as it took to Poland in that earlier period.</p>

  <p>First, it insists upon stopping the socialist reconstruction of Nicaragua and
  insists upon supporting and promoting the so-called private sector for the purpose of
  undermining socialist construction. It places political conditions on any credits for
  the purchase of much-needed technology to rebuild the destruction caused by the Somoza
  regime.</p>

  <p>Nicaragua's unwillingness to agree to internal "reforms" demanded by the U.S., which
  the latter labels "democratic reforms," is what lies at the bottom of the U.S.'s denial
  of export licenses to ship much-needed supplies to Nicaragua. This puts the country in
  a virtual state of embargo and blockade.</p>

  <p>This is what the U.S. began with its Cold War against Poland, other East European
  countries, and especially the Soviet Union.</p>

  <h4>'POLAND FEARS VIRTUAL U.S. EMBARGO'</h4>

  <p>A memorandum of conversation cabled by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
  Economic Affairs Thorp to Washington on April 9, 1948 (see document above) quotes
  then-Polish Ambassador to the U.S., Joseph Winiewicz, as saying:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"While Poland has made purchases approximately up to 60% of the total credit ...
    the Poles are unable to obtain vitally needed equipment such as bulldozers, shovels,
    etc., in addition to the blooming mills and slabbing mills, Poland fears that the
    American export policy might amount to a virtual embargo of shipments to Poland and
    that the members of the Polish government have been extremely reluctant to proceed
    any further with negotiations of the nationalization agreement."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The U.S. government was holding back export licenses and vital equipment and
  technology in order to first wrest a nationalization agreement. Under the terms of such
  an agreement, the U.S. would attempt to stop socialist ownership and control of the
  productive forces of Poland and the collectivization of land. It was a clear attempt to
  put the economic squeeze on Poland, dictate its economic and foreign policy, and make
  it capitulate on its internal social structure.</p>

  <p>Some in the State Department at the time were against this linkage.</p>

  <h4>ORIGIN OF 'LINKAGE'</h4>

  <p>The term linkage was recently revived with the new Cold War that Jimmy Carter and
  his National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski inaugurated and which Reagan is
  carrying to extremes. The term had its origins in the Cold War and specifically as it
  applied to Poland.</p>

  <p>Just as the Reagan administration is now saying to Poland, "If you want food
  shipments and extension of loans and technology, you better not abolish those very,
  very, democratic reforms" (those "reforms" which have virtually led Poland to the abyss
  and which are completely bourgeois-restorationist in character), the Truman
  administration was saying in 1948, "If you want the blooming mill and slabbing mill and
  other technology to put the coal industry in shape, then give up the socialist
  reconstruction of Poland"!</p>

  <p>What was demanded of the Polish people during that period, and which ended in a
  compromise, at least on paper, is now being revived on a more dangerous scale. In
  truth, it never was abandoned. It was continued on the basis of economic penetration
  via the huge loans and in collusion with a corrupt officialdom which saw great merit in
  opening up Poland completely to Western capitalist financial and economic
  penetration.</p>

  <p>The question of linkage, that is, of using U.S. and Western economic weapons as a
  means for political control by the imperialists, was never abandoned.</p>

  <h4>TIME FOR SHOWDOWN</h4>

  <p>On April 3, 1948, then-U.S. Ambassador to Poland Griffis, who was for linkage, wrote
  to the U.S. Secretary of State in a secret cable (see document quoted above) which
  concluded with this observation: "I might go along with this theory [of linkage].
  <strong>This is not the time for a showdown. But the time must come and we should not,
  without serious consideration, give up any trading elements which may appear for
  us."</strong> [Our emphasis &mdash; SM] (Signed by Griffis, page 530, Volume 4.)</p>

  <p>Indeed, the U.S. has never given up its so-called trading elements, its economic
  weapons, its billion-fold loans as weapons for economic and financial penetration.</p>

  <p>The time for the showdown, the U.S. imperialists apparently thought, had come with
  the secretly cultivated and now highly publicized Solidarity organization and its
  eventual evolution to the point where it openly plotted for a counter-revolutionary
  coup. The showdown came when this organization, under the guidance of U.S. agents,
  pro-imperialist bourgeois elements in Poland, prepared to call a national referendum
  for the purpose of overturning the government.</p>

  <p>It was then that the Polish Army asserted its right and its revolutionary duty to
  hurl back the bourgeois pro-imperialist attempt at a counter-revolution. Such a
  counter-revolution would have meant restoring Poland to its pre-war status as a
  satellite of imperialism and destroying the real independence of Poland. That in
  essence is what the struggle in Poland is all about today.</p>
