  <h5>Poland: Behind the Crisis [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>The new Polish crisis</h1>

  <h4>DECEMBER 16, 1981</h4>

  <p>The world capitalist press is trying to project the image that Poland is menaced by
  the military &mdash; by Polish or Soviet tanks.</p>

  <p>The reality of the situation is altogether different. Poland is, and has been,
  menaced for longer than two decades <strong>not by Eastern tanks, but by Western
  imperialist banks.</strong> Everything else said in the capitalist press is of a
  superficial character. They concentrate on phenomena which are the effects and not the
  profound causes of the economic and political crisis in Poland.</p>

  <h4>HALF-A-BILLION DUE JUST IN INTEREST</h4>

  <p>On the very day of the pronouncement of martial law and the military takeover, the
  capitalist press was forced to publish in its inside financial pages the fact that the
  previous Polish government had heavily indebted itself to the tune of between $26-30
  billion to almost 500 banks. The largest banks are from the U.S., West Germany,
  Britain, France, and Switzerland.</p>

  <p>The estimates of the debt vary from country to country and almost from day to day.
  But on the very day of the imposition of martial law the government was faced with
  <strong>$500 million due merely for interest on the debt!</strong> (Reported in the
  <em>New York Times, Wall Street Journal,</em> and <em>Christian Science Monitor,</em>
  December 14, 1981.)</p>

  <p>How is it possible for such a small country, in so short a time, to have piled up
  such an enormous debt and to have to pay the kind of interest that amounts to the
  annual wage bill of a fifth of the industrial work force of Poland?</p>

  <p>Did Poland get all this money &mdash; $26 billion to $30 billion &mdash; in the form
  of industrial equipment and goods? Or is it the product of "rollovers," an infamous
  practice of international finance capital? A rollover takes place when instead of
  paying the principal on the debt, the debt is "rolled over" and interest is added on at
  higher, more extortionate rates &mdash; and so it goes from year to year to year.</p>

  <p>How did Poland get itself in such a situation? How does a country which began
  socialist construction &mdash; the abolition of the private ownership of the means of
  production, the collectivization of much of the land, and the creation of a state
  monopoly of foreign trade &mdash; find itself paying ever-higher interest payments at
  the current rate of 20% without sufficient food to supply the population, with many of
  its factories idle, with inflation increasing, and with industrial production
  declining?</p>

  <h4>TURNED TO WEST FOLLOWING 1956 UPRISING</h4>

  <p>It happened because following a reactionary uprising in 1956, which overturned the
  then-existing leadership, Poland turned to the West. The country was opened up slowly
  and gradually to Western capitalism. The leadership thought this would gain Poland a
  normal, fair, and reasonable relationship with the capitalist West.</p>

  <p>The new Polish government virtually abolished collectivized agriculture and
  decentralized some of the important industries in order to be able to trade with the
  West. Above all they opened wide the gates to the penetration of finance capital under
  terms and conditions imposed by the Western banks.</p>

  <p>It was understood by the Polish authorities that Western capitalist markets would
  thus be opened to Polish products and that the import of necessary technology and
  materials would be made available on fair and equitable terms. It was also thought that
  the restrictions of a political character, like the so-called blacklists which the
  imperialists impose against other socialist countries such as Cuba, Viet Nam, etc.,
  would be lifted against Poland, assuring it of being treated as an "equal partner" in
  capitalist trade and commerce.</p>

  <h4>ECONOMY ENTANGLED WITH IMPERIALIST FINANCE CAPITAL</h4>

  <p>What followed, however, is part of the same undeviating pattern &mdash; the
  merciless, ruthless, and avaricious entanglement of all industrial Poland into the
  vortex of imperialist finance.</p>

  <p>For a few years, while the debts were piling up, the small amount of Polish exports
  to the capitalist West increased. Beginning with the early 1970s, however, the trend
  toward increased exports from Poland to the Western capitalist countries on a basis
  where they could compete and be sold diminished as a result of deliberate political
  measures taken by the imperialists.</p>

  <p>This made it more and more urgent, if the process of continuing the relationship
  with the West were not to be halted, to further increase the debts in order to
  facilitate exports and continue the purchase of needed commodities.</p>

  <p>This orientation made the economy of Poland completely dependent on Western markets,
  Western imports, and Western financing.</p>

  <p>The socialist sector in Poland was being steadily squeezed out and replaced by the
  relentless so-called market economy. A market economy, which means more capitalist
  commodity production, always generates greater and greater inequality. This results in
  a polarization between those who are better paid, those closer to the market, the
  bourgeois technocrats, those in the higher echelons of the officialdom engaged in
  running the economy, those involved in selling, purchasing, and general business
  dealings with the West, in a word the neo-bourgeois elements on the one hand, and the
  general working class on the other.</p>

  <p>Capitalist commodity production, both of a hidden as well as of an open character,
  was gradually replacing most of the socialist economic arteries that are the lifeblood
  of Poland. Only the legal right of public ownership and nationalization remained but
  this was merely like a skeleton, the last economic barrier to capitalist
  restoration.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the ravages of the world capitalist economy &mdash; inflation and
  unemployment, the invariable concomitants everywhere and every place of the penetration
  of international finance capital &mdash; while they had begun to envelop Poland much
  earlier, took on a galloping momentum and brought about the strike struggles of
  August-September 1980.</p>

  <p>There is no question that bankers throughout the capitalist world now openly
  acknowledge that the great crisis in Poland is at bottom an economic crisis and
  moreover admit having virtual economic control over the Polish economy as a result of
  their extraordinary financial stranglehold.</p>

  <h4>BANKS BOAST OF CONTROL OF ECONOMY</h4>

  <p><em>Workers World</em> newspaper was the first in the workers' movement here and
  abroad to call attention to the great danger that the penetration of Western capital
  posed for Poland and other socialist countries. The <em>New York Times</em> made this
  penetration public in a front-page story on January 26, 1979, in the kind of article
  which was more a boast by the banks than the release of a news item.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"As part of an effort to obtain a major, new loan," wrote the <em>Times,</em>
    "Poland has agreed to permit Western banks to monitor its economic policies, American
    bankers say. They regard the concession as a historic breakthrough in the financial
    relations with the communist world.</p>

    <p>"To persuade the banks to agree to the new financing, Poland has already had to
    announce a strict, new budget for 1979 and provide its creditors with comprehensive
    new information on its financial situation.</p>

    <p>"The banks involved in the new credit will henceforth track the progress of the
    Polish economy much as the International Monetary Fund monitors the economies of
    non-communist countries in financial distress."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This article was also a none too gentle hint that if further economic reforms in the
  direction of capitalism were not made, the stranglehold of the banks would become
  tighter.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Poland thereafter purged its chief banking executives and replaced them with
  personnel more amenable and accommodating to the Western imperialist bankers.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter was that along with economic control went economic
  destabilization and political infiltration, a process which had been going on
  throughout the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

  <h4>REAGANITES PROMOTE BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION</h4>

  <p>As is usual with the international banking consortiums, and the U.S. banks in
  particular, bribery and corruption went hand in hand in the negotiation of the
  loans.</p>

  <p>The Reagan administration, it should be remembered, has gone to the extent of urging
  the lifting of legal and perfunctory restrictions on multi-national corporations
  against bribery of foreign officials, as is practiced by Lockheed and hundreds of other
  multi-national corporations. American multi-nationals, they propose, should have the
  unrestricted right to bribe and corrupt.</p>

  <p>Of course, the current legal restrictions against bribery have resulted in fines
  which for the corporations are equivalent to traffic violations. A $50,000 or $100,000
  fine for bribes that run into the millions of dollars involving transactions of
  hundreds of millions of dollars is a mere irritant to the multi-nationals. But even
  this the Reaganites consider too heavy a burden on the "delicate" financial structure
  of the corporations and the banks.</p>

  <h4>CAN'T BUILD SOCIALISM WHILE SURRENDERING ECONOMY TO WEST</h4>

  <p>The steady and consistent purging of the officialdom in Poland and the bureaucratic
  inner struggles among the technical and industrial managerial groups were the result of
  pursuing a contradictory process with no satisfactory solution insofar as the needs of
  the mass of the workers were concerned. This contradiction is the attempt to construct
  socialism while at the same time surrendering the most vital aspects of economic life
  to Western capitalist interests. It led straight back to the very same ills that
  prevail in any capitalist country: high prices, shortages, concealed (as against open)
  unemployment, and the diversion of necessary productive facilities for marketing and
  exporting purposes.</p>

  <p>Attempts to recoup its financial losses have driven Poland deeper and deeper into
  the economic morass. The cause is not socialist planning, not so-called centralization
  of the economy, of which there has been little in Poland in the last two decades. It is
  the <strong>lack</strong> of socialist planning, the lack of self-reliance and
  self-sufficiency, the lack of socialist cooperation with the socialist community of
  which Poland is formally an integral part that has resulted in the precipitous decline
  in industrial production.</p>

  <h4>NICARAGUAN LEADER ON IMPERIALIST DOMINATION</h4>

  <p>Look at any underdeveloped country. You will see that Poland's situation differs
  little from any of the poor, oppressed, Third World countries where the Western
  imperialist banks are dominant.</p>

  <p>Listen to Daniel Ortega, the Nicaraguan representative who spoke at the UN General
  Assembly on October 7, 1981: Despite the Third World countries' efforts to restructure
  their foreign debt and pay its servicing with untold sacrifice [that's just the way it
  is in Poland now &mdash; SM] the present economic outlook is so dark that it calls for
  serious reflection. Unless formulas corresponding to our countries' economic realities
  are found, the only way out will be to waive the foreign debt, including its servicing.
  Otherwise the day will come when all the poor countries in the world, acting in common
  agreement, will have to say that we aren't going to pay because we have nothing to pay
  with.</p>

  <p>Poland's situation differs in only one respect from the other oppressed countries
  which have become indebted as a result of imperialist financial control over their
  destinies. This difference is that Poland has a strong industrial base. It has a
  tremendous coal industry. It is considered one of the ten most industrialized countries
  in the world.</p>

  <p>What happened was that it put its economic lifeblood, what the workers built up over
  decades, in hock to the banks.</p>

  <p>How did this happen? Was it merely the result of corruption of leadership, gross
  negligence, bureaucratic practices, and alienation from the mass of the people? In
  part, and only in part, this is true. But the historical roots for this are just as
  significant.</p>

  <h4>HISTORIC COMPROMISE</h4>

  <p>Poland was never a socialist country in the generally accepted definition of that
  term. Poland from the very beginning of its development after the Second World War was
  a compromise between world imperialism and the Soviet Union as well as between the
  conflicting class forces internally.</p>

  <p>The U.S., it must be remembered, emerged from the Second World War as the paramount
  victor with a nuclear monopoly and with the least amount of military casualties. The
  USSR, on the other hand, had been inflicted with untold destruction and lost over 20
  million lives &mdash; almost a million in the defense of Poland against the Nazis.</p>

  <p>These circumstances and the entire preceding historic period &mdash; the reign of
  political reaction in Poland, the hold of the Catholic hierarchy over the peasantry,
  the leanings of the petty bourgeoisie toward Western imperialism, and the divisions in
  the working class &mdash; made a full-scale socialist revolution in Poland impossible
  at the time.</p>

  <p>What did occur was the revolutionary intervention of the Soviet Red Army in alliance
  with the working-class and democratic, anti-fascist resistance movement. The bourgeois
  resistance movement, which in reality had been putting up a mild and token resistance
  to the Nazis, was, under the prompting of imperialism, veering in the direction of the
  restoration of a bourgeois republic as a satellite of Western, particularly U.S.,
  imperialism.</p>

  <p>Under these conditions, a historic compromise took place. Poland was established as
  a socialist republic in form, but in reality it was a halfway house between two social
  systems which at bottom were irreconcilable because they were based on diametrically
  opposed class interests and veering in different directions.</p>

  <h4>IMPERIALISTS WOULDN'T ALLOW POLAND TO 'LIVE AND LET LIVE'</h4>

  <p>The compromise could last only if the imperialist powers were content to at least
  let things in Poland work themselves out automatically on the basis of the internal
  class relations and class contradictions without imperialist economic and financial
  intervention.</p>

  <p>This was at bottom the understanding between the USSR and the imperialist powers
  when Poland was finally recognized as an independent and sovereign state.</p>

  <p>However Poland like the other socialist countries, was diplomatically, politically,
  and economically ostracized by the new imperialist <em>cordon sanitaire</em> when the
  Cold War began in earnest. At the same time, the pro-bourgeois, pro-imperialist
  internal forces, which under the compromise agreement were to have a voice and be part
  of the new regime, continued an uninterrupted, undercover war against Poland's
  pro-socialist course.</p>

  <p>It need hardly be stated that grave and serious mistakes of the leadership
  facilitated the course of the bourgeois restorationists. That. however. is another
  chapter in the history of the Polish workers' movement and of the world communist
  movement in general.</p>

  <p>The outstanding fact of Polish history since the 1956 reactionary uprising is the
  reemergence of the pro-capitalist elements, their infiltration into the workers'
  movement, and the corruption of the leadership &mdash; all as the result of the
  penetration of imperialist finance capital on such a huge extraordinary and utterly
  untenable basis. The latter was welcomed with open arms by the Polish Communist Party
  leadership.</p>

  <p>The day of reckoning had to come. The massive strikes, which began more than 16
  months ago, are not the effect of socialist planning and socialist construction, but
  the lack of it. Malignant finance capital was riding roughshod over the Polish
  economy.</p>

  <h4>WHY IMPERIALISTS REGARDED POLAND AS 'INDEPENDENT'</h4>

  <p>Sheer delight over the imperialists having so much sway in Poland prompted
  then-President Gerald Ford to proclaim in 1976, in a nationwide debate with
  then-Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter that "Poland is an independent state." Ford
  made his remark to an excited nationwide public, and a good part of the world was
  listening. It was prompted by Carter's goading of Ford on allegedly being "soft on
  communism" in Eastern Europe.</p>

  <p>This remarkable admission by Ford was not some hasty, thoughtless statement.
  Otherwise, he would have corrected it later, since he was certainly asked about it.
  Ford was merely stating publicly what was then understood politically in the U.S.
  capitalist establishment. This was particularly made clear by the briefings Ford got
  from Kissinger, his secretary of state, who in turn was, and is, an intimate of David
  Rockefeller. Rockefeller's immense financial control in the banking consortiums which
  deal with the Eastern European countries particularly Poland is well understood
  everywhere in the capitalist financial world.</p>

  <p>Ford, however, was slightly ahead of himself. He and the bankers, diplomats, and
  White House strategists at the time too hastily equated economic control with more or
  less general political control. It is true that political infiltration had already
  taken an enormous toll on the state structure in Poland. But automatic economic
  processes do not so easily translate themselves into full political control, even where
  political infiltration is very serious. There were still other progressive forces,
  hostile to imperialist control, available to the people of Poland.</p>

  <h4>IMPERIALISTS DIDN'T COUNT ON PROGRESSIVE FORCES</h4>

  <p>Soviet interventionm which the imperialist press has saturated the public with day
  in and day out, may be a last resort. But what the imperialist banking fraternity had
  not counted on was that the Polish military establishment would, at least for now,
  stand up, if not for a regeneration of socialist construction in the Marxist sense, at
  least as a barrier to the reestablishment of Poland as an imperialist satellite. That
  is what has happened since martial law was established in Poland.</p>

  <p>The real issue is not whether the military under present conditions is capable of,
  or is fully united in, resuscitating Poland on a socialist basis. The issue is whether
  the army, general staff and its commanding strata, aided by loyal soldiers and militia
  can help the working class stave off a counter-revolution under the phony flag of
  "Solidarity," which is a mask for covert, imperialist intervention. That is the real
  issue.</p>

  <p>A victory for the counter-revolution would be a victory for world imperialism. It
  would reinforce imperialist oppression and exploitation on a terrifying scale
  everywhere. It would embolden all the most reactionary elements in the capitalist
  world. It would darken the prospects for socialist struggle elsewhere. It would
  encourage the unbridled militarists in the Pentagon to move on Eastern Europe and lay
  the basis for an eventual confrontation with the USSR.</p>

  <p>In all of this, what has to be remembered is that the world capitalist crisis
  &mdash; intractable, pervasive, and malignant in its effects &mdash; has enveloped some
  of the socialist countries. Like a malignant disease, wherever it spreads its tentacles
  it tears down the healthy foundations. Over the last 70 years it has brought about
  dozens of counter-revolutionary insurrections, military dictatorships, two imperialist
  wars, atomic annihilation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the current nuclear
  saber-rattling over Western Europe. A Polish counterrevolution would facilitate the
  deployment of U.S. missiles in Europe and make the struggle against imperialist war
  that much more difficult.</p>

  <p>The workers of the world and the workers in the United States have nothing to gain
  and a great, great deal to lose by supporting, encouraging, or promoting the cause of
  this counter-revolutionary, fink outfit misnamed Solidarity. The latter, under the
  influence and direction of imperialist agents, has captured a formidable part of the
  Polish workers, and on the morrow of its victory would hand them over lock, stock, and
  barrel to the imperialist powers, above all the U.S.</p>
