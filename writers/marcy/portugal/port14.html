    Inflation and unemployment high as fascist regime fights losing colonial wars in
    Africa. Caetano fascist regime overthrown by military (April 25). Thousands of

    and manufacturing industries sweep Portugal. Spinola attacks the strikers; CP calls

    16), receives first diplomatic visit from U.S. ambassador. Demonstration of 6,000 in
    Lisbon demands Portuguese troops out of Africa (May 25). Air Force General Carlos

    control of state-run radio and TV (June 19). Cabinet (including SP and CP) issues

    demonstrations, or to offend the president, members of the Council of State, or the
    cabinet. SP leader and foreign minister, Mario Soares, attends NATO conference in
    Ottawa. Nixon visits Spinola in the Azores.</dd>

    large street demonstrations. Spinola confines leftists troops to barracks (July 6-7),
    sends troops considered right-wing to break up leftist demonstration. "Economic
    reform" law issued (July 6) that limits right to strike, strengthens private
    property, encourages foreign investment. Thousands of civil servants demonstrate
    against law (July 8).</dd>

    <dt><strong>August</strong><br /></dt>

    <dd>Spinola announces Portual is ready to "grant" independence to African colonies,
    but insists guerrillas lay down their arms. Guerrilla groups continue struggle;
    Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique make plans for independence with Portugal unable to
    mount any offensive there.</dd>

    <dt><strong>September</strong><br /></dt>

    <dd>Rightist rally called by President Spinola in name of "silent majority" is
    canceled after armed workers, peasants, and soldiers together set up roadblocks in

    mobilization of the workers and progressive military, with the CP playing a leading
    role in calling out the workers (March 11). Spinola flees to Spain. Almost all banks
    are nationalized (March 15). Premier Goncalves assures businessmen that government
    doesn't intend to nationalize whole economy. Workers and soldiers join in huge
    demonstration to honor soldier killed in the aborted coup. Junta bans two left and
    one rightist party from upcoming election (March 18). U.S. embassy, Ford, Kissinger
    all make threats against Portugal. Five NATO countries warn Portuguese President da
    Costa Gomes against "making Portugal a communist country."</dd>
