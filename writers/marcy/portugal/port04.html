  <h1>Theory of Social Fascism and the MRPP</h1>

  <p><em>By Sam Marcy</em></p>

  <h4>February 23, 1975</h4>

  <p>In his celebrated book, <em>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte,</em> Marx
  said that great personalities occasionally appear in history twice, once as tragedy and
  again as farce. He might have added that the same can also be said of some
  organizations.</p>

  <p>We have in mind the Movement for the Reorganization of the Proletariat (MRPP) and
  similar but smaller Maoist groupings in Portugal. This is not to deny that they are
  serious organizations with dedicated cadre and with revolutionary convictions</p>

  <p>At the moment, the MRPP is clearly in the ascendant as a result of its leadership in
  the Oporto and Lisbon demonstrations in recent weeks. Its gains, which are minimal, are
  mostly at the expense of the CP, whose crass opportunism and class collaborationist
  policy with the bourgeoisie evoke an easy revulsion in the hearts of all the militants,
  especially the young.</p>

  <p><strong>'Social-fascism' and the German defeat</strong></p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the MRPP's relentless advocacy and wild pursuit of the slogan
  "social-fascists out of the trade unions" (by which they mean the CP) and "revisionism
  in power means social-fascism in power" clearly marks them out as a farcical or
  tragicomic version of the German CP of the late 1920s. The latter's fatal policy led to
  the decimation of the German CP and ushered in the Hitlerite period of horror
  destruction and catastrophe, unprecedented in history.</p>

  <p>The origin of the MRPP's self-defeating policy lies with Stalin's false and spurious
  approach to the German Social-Democracy, which resulted in catastrophe and defeat.</p>

  <p>It was the Stalin-Manuilsky-Thaelmann view that since the Social-Democracy in
  Germany was only socialist in words while in reality fascist in character, it would
  therefore be erroneous to offer a united front with them in the struggle against
  Hitler. This ignored that the Social-Democracy at that time had a tremendous working
  class following, even larger than that of the CP.</p>

  <p>Neglecting a united front tactic with the Social-Democracy left the workers divided
  and bereft of leadership and objectively eased the road of Hitler to power.</p>

  <p>It was this calamitous course which impelled Stalin thereafter to make a 180-degree
  turn toward full, unprincipled, class-collaborationist united front tactics with the
  Social-Democracy, the fruits of which are all too visible today in the policies of the
  French, Italian, and Portuguese CPs.</p>

  <p><strong>Bolshevik united front tactics</strong></p>

  <p>Basically, Stalin's German policy meant a rejection of Lenin's and Trotsky's
  victorious united front tactic, in which the Bolsheviks correctly blocked, in a
  principled manner, with the Mensheviks and Kerensky against Kornilov the leader of the
  counterrevolution and Russia's equivalent of Hitler and Spinola and thereafter
  vanquished the Mensheviks and Kerensky in the successful October Revolution.</p>

  <p>it is easy to dismiss the MRPP slogans as mere polemical exaggerations or abusive
  rhetorical invective, born in the heat of struggle, which should not be taken too
  seriously. Would that that were so.</p>

  <p>However, these slogans are the keystone to their fundamental policy and their
  commitment to them is as dogmatic and blind to the realities of the day as was that of
  the German CP, but with much, much less justification. For fascism was then a new
  phenomenon and defiance of Stalin and the Comintern meant virtual isolation from the
  revolutionary working class movement.</p>

  <p>"Theory," Lenin used to frequently remark, quoting from Goethe, "is gray, but the
  tree of life is green."</p>

  <p>The theoretician and architect of the first successful proletarian revolution did
  not, of course, mean to denigrate the significance of theory in relation to
  revolutionary practice. On the contrary, his remark was meant to emphasize the need to
  critically examine the application of Marxist theory to every new, concrete
  situation.</p>

  <p>To dogmatically or mechanically apply a given theoretical proposition without regard
  to the concrete reality of the situation, Lenin warned, was a sure road to disaster for
  a revolutionary workers' party. Over and over again, Lenin proved himself to be the
  giant revolutionary theoretician and practitioner of Marxism by subjecting to the most
  searching and critical analysis each and every unfolding event during the long course
  of three Russian revolutions, the Civil War, the imperialist interventions, and the
  formative years of the establishment of the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>Of course, there cannot always be such a rich and varied succession of world-shaking
  events as was experienced in Russia. At other times there may be many weeks, months,
  and years, when divergent theoretical propositions may be debated endlessly without
  there being any significant events to confirm the validity of a given theory.</p>

  <p>The ultimate test for all theory lies in the crucible of experience &mdash;
  experience which the masses themselves go through.</p>

  <p><strong>What the Portuguese experience reveals about the CP</strong></p>

  <p>What has been the experience of the Portuguese working class since the overthrow of
  the Salazar-Caetano fascist dictatorship on April 25? Has this experience verified or
  invalidated the theory of social-fascism as a scientific, Marxist-Leninist appraisal of
  the Portuguese CP?</p>

  <p>The events of September 28 throw a powerful searchlight on the social character of
  the CP as a working class organization, and at the same time tear to shreds and
  hopelessly discredit the analysis of the MRPP.</p>

  <p>What happened on September 28? On that day, General Spinola attempted a
  counter-revolutionary coup d'etat. He hoped to mask the coup with popular support by a
  call to the so-called "silent majority" to converge on Lisbon where he would present to
  the Portuguese a counter-revolutionary <em>fait accompli.</em> His call for popular
  support, in reality was a call for a fascist, Mussolini-type march on Lisbon.</p>

  <p>But Spinola was stopped in his tracks. He was stopped by a timely giant anti-fascist
  mobilization. Spinola's fascist supporters were turned back. The, coup proved abortive
  and collapsed.</p>

  <p>Who took the initiative in organizing and mobilizing the workers and students to
  stop the Mussolini-like march? It was the Portuguese CP. Can this be denied? Can this
  important initiative by the CP be characterized as the work of social fascists, i.e.,
  socialists in words but fascists in deeds? It would not only be patently false, but
  absurd in the extreme.</p>

  <p>By this mass action alone, the CP raised its prestige tremendously, not only among
  the workers but among the Portuguese masses as a whole. The CP leadership is still
  resting on its laurels from the popular support it won as a result of this significant
  initiative. It was this timely move which not only dealt a blow against a fascist
  comeback but also weakened the possessing classes in Portugal. It accounts for why the
  world bourgeoisie was so alarmed in the weeks that followed the Spinolist attempted
  coup, and still is &mdash; even more so today.</p>

  <p><strong>Reformist &mdash; but not fascist</strong></p>

  <p>True, everything the CP did in connection with the mass antifascist mobilization was
  done in the spirit of class collaboration. All its propaganda centered around and was
  confined to the narrow limits of the struggle against the resurgent reaction. It
  limited the struggle then, and has continually done so since then, to merely defending
  the status quo, defending the democratic rights the masses have gained until now, but
  severely restricting them to the framework of bourgeois democracy. But then, this has
  been their line for decades, since the middle '30s and during Stalin's lifetime.</p>

  <p>It is avowedly a party without a revolutionary perspective for the overthrow of the
  bourgeois state. At its recent convention it even eliminated the phrase dictatorship of
  the proletariat from its program (which is a program in itself). What does this prove?
  It proves that the CP has degenerated into a reformist party and renounced the
  revolutionary class struggle. But it has not been converted into a fascist organization
  and has no kinship to one whatever.</p>

  <p>The September 28 events were of enormous significance. They demonstrated that the
  CP, because it is rooted in the working class movement, has a stake in the struggle
  against counter-revolution and fascist dictatorship and is even capable of taking a
  bold initiative in this struggle as a measure of self-defense.</p>

  <p>This does not necessarily mean that it can maintain the initiative, but that, as
  against the danger of a rightist attack, it has a strong material interest in
  mobilizing the working class against the thrust of the fascist reaction of the
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>The MRPP must have felt this in their bones on September 28, when thousands of CP
  rank and filers and sympathizers were mounting the barricades and the MRPP, as well as
  other organizations to the left of the CP, had to join them in a disorderly manner,
  while the PCP carried the anti-fascist mobilization through in a planned and organized
  fashion.</p>

  <p><strong>No principled united front</strong></p>

  <p>True, Alvaro Cunhal, the CP leader, might formally have called the MRPP and other
  militant organizations to a united front on this crucial event, but that would have
  been expecting the CP leadership to have acted in a principled, revolutionary, working
  class manner. The fact that they did not do this hardly transforms them into "social
  fascists."</p>

  <p>The MRPP could scarcely have expected such a call. Its policy towards the CP is so
  violent, so hostile, and so unreasoning, that it virtually excludes almost any type of
  working class collaboration, even with kindred organizations, let alone the CP-and even
  in the face of the greatest danger. Instead of offering a united front to the CP, even
  if only for the purpose of exposing the CP, it let them off the hook and enabled the CP
  to justify its policy to its own rank and file.</p>

  <p>The MRPP's strategy is the crassest example of that blind, petty-bourgeois
  fanaticism which cannot even recognize the need to take the most elementary measures
  for its own self-defense, measures which in moments of great crisis are necessary and
  without which it will surely end up in the destruction of its organization.</p>

  <p>The erroneous position of the MRPP, however, does not absolve the PCP of its own
  blatant revisionism, which is also the legacy of Stalin. The broad resurgence of the
  working-class movement, which the Portuguese proletariat is now experiencing, makes it
  imperative and in the most vital interest of the success of the Portuguese revolution
  to cleanse the Augean stables of Stalin's terrible legacy.</p>

  <p>The Portuguese proletariat has the opportunity and the challenge to see to it that
  the dead hand of the past should not impede the road to its revolutionary future.</p>
