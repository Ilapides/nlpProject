  <h1>Analysis of roles of Gomes, Carvalho</h1>

  <h3>As the crisis in Portugal continues</h3>

  <p><em>By Sam Marcy</em></p>

  <h4>Aug. 27, 1975</h4>

  <p>The cause of the Portuguese revolution seems to be drifting from day to day without
  a rudder. But this is due in large measure to the great reliance that has been placed
  on the outcome of the split in the military. This, in turn, has made President Costa
  Gomes appear to carry a great deal more social, political, and military weight than is
  actually the case.</p>

  <p>At the present time he is playing the role of arbiter, not merely between the
  military groupings but between revolution and counterrevolution historically an utterly
  untenable position.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely possible at this late date for him to assume a Bonapartist role, as
  the <em>New York Times</em> of August 27 in its news dispatch seems to indicate might
  happen when it mentions the possibility of the President "taking over also as
  Premier."</p>

  <p><strong>Gomes has no independent strength</strong></p>

  <p>A Bonapartist, in bourgeois society, can assume the position of straddling the
  classes or military factions only if he can afford to be independent of them on the
  basis of having his own independent military or police force. That at the moment does
  not appear to be at all the case. What has given Costa Gomes his preeminent position is
  the preponderant reliance that the left has accorded him. In an interview with
  syndicated columnists Evans and Novak, Costa Gomes was quoted as saying that the
  burning, sacking, and wanton destruction of Communist Party headquarters "was the work
  of small groups" that were "organized from the outside." He further stated that he
  "could arrest all these groups and imprison them" and the "Portuguese people would be
  educated" accordingly by this action.</p>

  <p>This statement should come as a big surprise, both in Portugal and abroad, for in
  all these many weeks in which the counter-revolutionary mobs have been attacking the CP
  headquarters, the President has been demonstratively passive if not altogether
  silent.</p>

  <p>At any rate, this statement seemed to put Costa Gomes once again on a tack to the
  left. But it did not take long for the President to veer right back again with another
  of his deliberately ambiguous statements regarding the replacement of Premier
  Goncalves.</p>

  <p>It was followed on the weekend by more confusing statements. One of them, however,
  seemed to clearly indicate that Prime Minister Goncalves should remain in power until
  the present crisis is resolved. But this again was suspended or withdrawn from
  circulation, whichever way one wishes to interpret Gomes' statements.</p>

  <p>But the fact that Costa Gomes has not yielded to the ultimatums which have been
  delivered more openly and more insolently from day to day by the right-wing military
  camarilla, headed by Melo Antunes, indicates that Costa Gomes is fearful of taking the
  plunge to the right.</p>

  <p>This, however, is not at all due to any newfound sympathy for the cause of the
  revolution, socialism, or elementary democratic rights. It must not be forgotten that
  Costa Gomes was the former chief of staff under the Caetano regime. If he has not moved
  to the right where his sympathies really lie, it can only be accounted for by objective
  developments which compel him to stay, at least for now, where he is.</p>

  <p><strong>Carvalho and Antunes</strong></p>

  <p>One of the most important factors which Costa Gomes has had to reckon with has been
  the apparent collapse of the bloc between the Antunes right-wing and chief of the
  security forces Carvalho. This bloc between the right and what has been described as
  the extreme left was an utterly unprincipled one from the point of view of working
  class politics and foolish and adventuristic in the extreme on the part of Carvalho.
  The fact that the bloc seems to have collapsed is in all probability due to the
  realization on the part of Carvalho that the right-wing was using him as a left cover
  for what would have surely been a right-wing coup. And he would have ended up as a
  captive within it.</p>

  <p>If one disregards his political program, the bloc with the right could only be
  understood as an attempt at naked military power politics, in which case, Carvalho
  could not have played the lead role anyway. Given the vicissitudes of bourgeois
  military politics, however, repeated maneuvers of this kind cannot be ruled out for the
  future.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the bloc collapsed after the marines, originally under the
  jurisdiction of Copcon and therefore under Carvalho's command, had been shifted away
  from him, according to the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> of August 26 back to
  their pro-Goncalves commanders. How and by what means this was accomplished is not
  known but it has been accepted as an accomplished fact.</p>

  <p>Still within the framework of military politics, Goncalves received the backing of
  what the bourgeois press calls "a sergeants' group," but which is more properly called
  the non-commissioned officers' council of the Armed Forces Movement (AFM). They could
  be a lot more significant in the impending struggle than some of the generals and
  admirals, who may find themselves, once the struggle breaks out, without any support of
  the rank-and-file.</p>

  <p><strong>Goncalves stronger than admitted</strong></p>

  <p>The imperialist press here now admits, in the words of the <em>Christian Science
  Monitor</em> (Aug. 26), "It is a mistake to think that General Vasco Goncalves is
  isolated. He has the backing of the navy, the marines, and many of the rank and file in
  the army and enough of the air force to neutralize the other moderate half."</p>

  <p>That certainly makes his strength far more impressive than the capitalist media have
  led the American public to believe.</p>

  <p>Two important and seemingly contradictory moves made this Monday have just appeared
  in the press. Acting in his role as arbiter, Costa Gomes apparently approved the
  reinstatement of General Carvalho as commander of Portugal's northern military region.
  Carvalho had been dismissed because of right-wing pressure, and would presumably take a
  much tougher stand against the right-wing attacks.</p>

  <p>At the same time, however, the Revolutionary Council of the Armed Forces Movement
  decided to suspend the activities of the Fifth Division of the General Staff. This is
  an ambiguous but potentially very dangerous move. The Fifth Division in charge of
  internal propaganda and the "dynamization" campaign, had been under the command of a
  navy officer generally considered pro-Goncalves. This could turn out to be a far more
  significant move than the reinstatement of Carvalho.</p>

  <p>The fact that Copcon security forces under General Carvalho's command have been
  ordered to guard the headquarters of the Fifth Division is even more ominous.</p>

  <p>However, all of this is in the framework of military politics, where the class
  struggle can only be refracted in a distorted way. The true test of class forces, of
  course, will only come in the course of the impending struggle.</p>

  <p><strong>United front against reaction</strong></p>

  <p>All the more welcome is the announcement that eight working class political
  organizations in Portugal have formed a United Front Against Reaction. These include
  with the CP organizations far to its left who have maintained a position for armed
  defense of the revolution as well as for workers' councils or popular assemblies.
  Indeed, this is the most significant development and should far outweigh the military
  maneuvering at the top. It lays the basis for a class alliance against the bourgeoisie,
  the landlords, and the capitalists.</p>

  <p>(Workers World has so far been able to find out the names of six of the groups in
  the United Front. They are: the Communist Party (CP), the Portuguese Democratic
  Movement (MPD), the Movement of the Socialist Left (MES), the Popular Socialist Front
  (FSP), the Revolutionary Party of the Proletariat (PRP) and the International Communist
  League (LCI).)</p>

  <p>This has struck terror into the heart of Mario Soares who characterized the united
  front as "an unnatural alliance of the insurrectional type." No not at all unnatural.
  From a class point of view, the alliance of the PCP with these revolutionary
  organizations ought to be quite natural, that is, proper from the point of view of
  organizations which may have fundamental differences among themselves but are united in
  the struggle against the counterrevolution. Were Mario Soares responsive merely to the
  very name of his organization &mdash; socialist &mdash; he should be in this alliance
  instead of in the embrace of reactionary forces he thinks he is leading but who in
  reality are leading him.</p>

  <p>As in all unfinished revolutions, the question of legitimacy, of legality, assumes
  dimensions which nowhere correspond to reality. Costa Gomes was accorded the symbol of
  the legitimacy of the revolution when he became President following the defeat of the
  Spinola coup.</p>

  <p>But the only real legitimacy in a revolutionary situation is the authoritative
  intervention of the broad mass of the workers and peasants. However, their organs of
  power have only begun to be formed. They alone can validate or legitimate the
  representatives of the new regime. That is why the recently formed United Front is a
  genuinely hopeful sign in that direction.<br /></p>
