  <h1>Stop U.S.-made fascist drive in Portugal!</h1>

  <p><em>By Sam Marcy</em></p>

  <h4>August 19, 1975</h4>

  <p>Ever since the overthrow of the Salazar-Caetano fascist dictatorship in April 1974,
  the U.S. government has been slowly and methodically preparing to ruin the Portuguese
  revolution, stop what it calls the drift to the far left, and frustrate the aspirations
  of the working class of Portugal for a revolutionary socialist transformation of their
  country and an end to their age-old poverty and involvement in colonialist and
  imperialist wars against the African people.</p>

  <p>Very much in the manner in which it gathered the Greek colonels together and forged
  them into a fascist camarilla to overthrow the Greek government so again today it is
  following the same pattern in Portugal. It has used every conceivable device to weld
  together the right-wing, so-called moderate faction of the Portuguese military and is
  preparing to use them in a counter-revolutionary fascist coup.</p>

  <p>The U.S. government is also using the same tested methods it employed in Chile to
  overthrow the Allende regime. This time, however, it has for many, many months been
  carrying on a virtual psychological war to prepare public opinion in this country for
  the eventual fascist coup, which it hopes will be successful &mdash; but which still
  remains to be seen.</p>

  <p><strong>U.S. tactics for counter-revolution</strong></p>

  <p>The Ford-Rockefeller-Kissinger administration has today a virtual army of CIA agents
  and military personnel operating in Portugal. It has spent practically unlimited
  amounts of money to bribe, corrupt, or otherwise ensnare the Socialist Party, the
  Popular Democratic Party, the right-wing Christian Centrist Party, and the Catholic
  hierarchy. In addition, all along it has virtually had in its pocket all the
  dispossessed elements of the Portuguese bourgeoisie and absentee landlords. All this is
  part and parcel of a broad plan for what is called in CIA jargon "destabilization" of
  the government. A part of this plan goes under the name of disinformation which means
  to mount a campaign of lies and deception.</p>

  <p>In its public form it has taken the route of instigating wild rumors of Soviet
  intervention and Soviet financial support to the Portuguese CP. The truth of the matter
  is that far from interfering in Portugal, the Soviet Union is going out of its way to
  merely give platonic, rhetorical support. Its call on August 19 for "mass solidarity"
  is merely a pro-forma statement expressing solidarity and urging working class and
  progressive support. But considering the vast political, diplomatic, as well as
  economic and financial resources the Soviet Union could be utilizing, this can scarcely
  be called a threat to dominate Portuguese developments.</p>

  <p>The U.S. capitalist press, on the other hand, is deliberately trying to conjure up
  the specter of a military confrontation with the USSR over Portugal. This is nothing
  but a smokescreen for U.S. interventionist schemes in the event the fascist coup which
  the U.S. is preparing founders.</p>

  <p>Even the <em>New York Times,</em> which has led the capitalist press in lying and
  vilifying the struggle of the Portuguese people, has had to assure its readers that the
  "geopolitical situation of Portugal rules out ... Soviet intervention." And it adds,
  "the logistics of trying to move a sizable Soviet army into Portugal by sea or air must
  daunt even the most hawkish of Soviet generals."</p>

  <p>This, however, is just another way &mdash; a crude and cynical way &mdash; of saying
  that there is no possibility of Soviet intervention, that it is a figment of the
  capitalist media's inflamed imagination. The real threat to the Portuguese revolution
  comes from the desperate efforts of the dispossessed ruling class elements of Portugal
  and their masters in Washington.</p>

  <p>The last 10 days have seen Kissinger mount the platform in Birmingham. Ala., as the
  guest of the ultra-rightist, violently racist Alabama Senator Allen to warn the
  Portuguese people that the U.S. government is supporting the so-called moderates in the
  army, that cabal of military officers, whom the U.S., in collaboration with its Western
  imperialist allies, is counting on to carry out the counter-revolutionary blood
  bath.</p>

  <p>As though that were inadequate, President Ford utilized the convention of the
  American Legion, itself a jingoist, racist, war-mongering sounding board, to launch a
  virtual threat against the Soviet Union for its supposed aid to the Portuguese CP.</p>

  <p>But the purpose of the Ford-Kissinger threats was not only to mobilize public
  opinion in the United States but to solidly line up the Western imperialist allies and
  to threaten Portugal with NATO intervention. We have on more than one occasion alluded
  to the fact that General Haig the commander of NATO instigated and carried out last
  winter NATO exercises which were clearly calculated to threaten the Portuguese
  government. He also subsequently visited Portugal and was in contact with right-wing
  military leaders.</p>

  <p>The U.S., through its ambassador to Lisbon Frank Carlucci, threatened a naval
  blockade of Portugal in the event that the imperialist powers in the NATO alliance feel
  it necessary. This was obliquely brought out in a significant column by William
  Buckley, ultra-rightist ally of Nixon and Ford. It is also well known that former
  Portuguese President Spinola visited Western Europe only a fortnight ago and met with
  other right-wing politicians as well as with Portuguese "socialist" leaders. His call
  for another fascist coup attempt under the label of the "Portuguese Democratic
  Liberation Movement" has deliberately been given wide publicity by the Western European
  imperialist press and here too, as well as by his adherents in Portugal and by elements
  of the Portuguese press which are pledged to bourgeois reaction and restoration.</p>

  <p><strong>Danger comes from U.S.</strong></p>

  <p>It is high time that the radical, working class, and progressive elements in the
  United States recognize that the true, the real and fundamental danger to the
  Portuguese revolution emanates from the center of world imperialism &mdash; from
  Washington. It is imperialism which sustained the 50-year-old fascist dictatorship in
  Portugal. It is imperialism that has needed Portugal as a satellite to plunder the
  African people, especially in Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and other areas. The
  fruits of the plunder have in a large measure gone to the multi-national corporations
  of Western imperialism, mostly the U.S. The Portuguese working class has been bled dry
  for years in a fruitless endeavor to hold in bondage through war and monstrous
  oppression the peoples of Southern Africa so that the imperialist monopolies will
  retain their hold on the oppressed peoples there.</p>

  <p>The U.S. in particular needs to retain Portugal as a satellite, as a threat to all
  the Mediterranean peoples, as a dagger at the heart of the Arab people, and as a threat
  to the Western proletariat in its struggle against the European bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>No, the danger does not lie in Portugal becoming a satellite of the USSR, the danger
  lies in Portugal remaining a sub-imperialist satellite of American imperialism and a
  base for counter-revolutionary struggle against all the Mediterranean countries and
  Africa.</p>

  <p>The attention of the American workers must be drawn to the true role of U.S.
  monopoly capitalism in Portugal. And every effort must be made to stop U.S.
  intervention, both overt and covert, in Portugal and to aid the Portuguese working
  class in its struggle against the counter-revolution.</p>

  <p>It is the rule of principled class politics that a working class party never make a
  bloc with the right against the center on fundamental class issues. Whoever in this
  hour of supreme crisis for the Portuguese working class fails to see the true role of
  U.S. imperialism and subordinates the struggle against it, making a bloc with rightist
  elements in the name of the so-called struggle against "Soviet social imperialism" or
  "Stalinism," is betraying the masses and in fact diverting them from their principal
  task, which is the struggle against the imminent fascist counter-revolution.</p>

  <h3>On the popular assemblies</h3>

  <p>We have indicated on a number of occasions, especially in the July 16 <em>Workers
  World,</em> that the popular assemblies composed of organizations of workers, peasants,
  and soldiers are a progressive, revolutionary alternative to a bourgeois constituent
  assembly &mdash; such as the one that was elected this spring and is promoted here on
  the left by the SWP.</p>

  <p>They could be organs of working class power and are the embryo of a workers' state,
  especially if they broaden their popular mass base.</p>

  <p>We also made the point that if the AFM validated them, which it has, that could
  strengthen the legal basis for the popular assemblies and open the road to action
  <strong>independent</strong> of the military. This would be a most favorable
  development.</p>

  <p>However, if they are restricted in their popular support and have no decision-making
  power, and do not seek it, they would only be a rubber stamp for a military grouping.
  (This is only hypothetical.) We have stated again and again that the military is a
  bourgeois institution trained over many years in the suppression of oppressed peoples
  in Africa and is hardly the best instrument for guiding the popular assemblies.</p>

  <p>We by no means contest that there are progressive and even revolutionary officers,
  especially in the junior ranks, but they must be responsible to the popular assemblies
  and not the other way around. Nor should the working class parties stake their
  existence on ephemeral moods in the politics of the AFM. The popular assemblies must
  continue to develop their own people's militia of the type that crushed the first
  attempted coup of Spinola. [SM]<br /></p>
