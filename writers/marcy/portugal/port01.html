  <h1>The Political Crisis in Portugal</h1>

  <p><em>By Sam Marcy</em></p>

  <h4>February 4, 1975</h4>

  <p>As the political crisis in Portugal deepens, a classic showdown of unprecedented
  dimensions seems absolutely inevitable Certainly all the signs point in that
  direction.</p>

  <p>The Oporto events of January 25, in which left-wing militants broke up the
  convention of the so-called Social Democratic Center Party (a neo-fascist organization)
  and in which the delegates had to be rescued the next day by government paratroops, is
  only one symptom of the temper of the mass movement of the working class.</p>

  <p><strong>Demonstration in Oporto</strong></p>

  <p>The Oporto demonstration was not composed merely of MRPP (so-called "Maoists")
  militants but encompassed a considerable spectrum of others, even including youths from
  the Socialist Party, which felt obligated to publicly disavow them. But most important,
  all accounts in the Western capitalist press, including Le Monde, the <em>London
  Economist</em>, and the international weekly edition of the <em>Manchester
  Guardian</em>, show that the soldiers were friendly to the demonstrators and well-nigh
  fraternized with them.</p>

  <p>The <em>London Economist</em> goes so far as to state that "there are unconfirmed
  reports that the police were fired on by conscripts (soldiers) sympathetic to the
  rioters, which may be partly borne out by the fact that five policemen were admitted to
  hospital with bullet-wounds that night. At any rate, it appears that the soldiers, who
  moved about haphazardly without any apparent direction, made no attempt to disperse the
  crowd." (<em>London Economist</em>, February 1)</p>

  <p>The <em>Manchester Guardian</em> weekly of February 1 confirms that "the conference
  had to be abandoned after left-wing demonstrators besieged the hall while police and
  troops stood by."</p>

  <p>Thus, while the government sent troops to defend the neo-fascist conference, the
  soldiers, at least to a limited degree, fraternized with the demonstrators. Alvaro
  Cunhal, the CP leader, of course denied that the CP had anything to do with the
  demonstration and condemned it as a "provocation by reactionaries and networks of
  agents of foreign services." He characterized it as a "valuable contribution to
  reaction."</p>

  <p>Of course, it is entirely possible that there were agent provocateurs in the midst
  of the demonstration and, in the light of the general political situation, the CIA
  might very well have been interested in converting it into some sort of a frame-up to
  utilize it for purposes that would undermine the revolutionary struggle. This could
  happen at any demonstration, but, it certainly would not, and does not in this case,
  detract one iota from the political significance of the demonstration which overpowered
  the neo-fascist conference so that it had to be rescued by government paratroops.</p>

  <p><strong>Owners abandon lands, factories</strong></p>

  <p>In the background of the political crisis are matters of broader social significance
  which are responsible for the growing acuteness of class antagonisms. In the first
  place, the number of estates abandoned by landlords has vastly increased and all the
  indications are that the abandonments are by no means voluntary acts of the landlords.
  They have fled, in many cases, for fear of their lives. Many are in Brazil, Paris, and
  London, and a good many are lobbying in Washington &mdash; as if the Pentagon and the
  State Department would need any nudging to intervene.</p>

  <p>But the same story is also true of the abandonment of industrial enterprises. Many
  capitalists have fled the country. It is well known that agricultural workers have
  taken over the tilling of the land on many estates and that workers are doing the same
  thing in some establishments which have been vacated by their employers. It is needless
  to state that the banks are sabotaging the economy and while the government tries to
  give the appearance of normalcy, the fact of the matter is that the possessing classes
  and their representatives as well as sympathizers in the courts, the police, and the
  military &mdash; are not viewing the matter with equanimity at all.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the most frantic efforts are being made by the battered possessing
  classes to regain their standing, they feel themselves endangered, notwithstanding the
  assurances of the government.</p>

  <p><strong>Behind the growing split</strong></p>

  <p>The fear of the ruling class has manifested itself in a virtual split in the
  coalition forged by the CP with the SP (Socialist Party) and the PPD (Popular
  Democratic Party). It, explains why the latter two organizations have moved swiftly
  towards the right at a time when popular sentiment among the masses has shifted to the
  left. This is a characteristic frequently seen in a revolutionary situation. The masses
  move sharply to the left while the leaders, frightened by the hostile pressure of the
  possessing classes, move to the right.</p>

  <p>The CP position from the very beginning has been a gradualistic approach towards the
  economic problems of the working class and the reshaping of capitalist society in
  general. Its conception of the developing struggle was limited to the framework of
  bourgeois democracy. It therefore most enthusiastically pushed the broadest possible
  united front which included the SP and the <small>PPD.</small></p>

  <p>But the course of the struggle has shown that the possessing as well as the
  non-possessing classes in Portuguese society (as in any society divided into classes)
  have entirely different, opposing, and antagonistic conceptions of democracy. Each must
  try to defend its own class interests. In the present critical situation in Portugal,
  the kind of popular democracy envisioned in the CP program is utopian. The possessing
  classes are out to fight tooth and nail to regain and enlarge their property, which to
  them is the essence of "democracy."</p>

  <p>Salazar and Caetano defended that kind of "democracy" and a return to those "happy
  days" is certainly what they have in mind. This is what's at the bottom of the
  continuing series of political shifts at the top echelons of the Armed Forces Movement
  and the government.</p>

  <p><strong>The trade union law</strong></p>

  <p>The most recent crisis over the trade union law gave the SP the opportunity to try
  to bolt from the coalition because the law would give a tremendous advantage to the new
  trade union confederation, which has an overwhelming predominance of CP influence.</p>

  <p>Wilfred Burchett ( <em>Guardian,</em> February 3) states that the antimonopoly bill
  the terms of which apparently limit the capitalist monopolies, is the real heart of the
  dispute. But it does not really matter. Nor does it matter that Cunhal has in his
  latest pronouncement spelled out, more specifically than at any other time, economic
  measures for a restructuring of Portuguese society which are far more attractive than
  originally stated in more vague and general terms.</p>

  <p>For instance, he is quoted as saying in a January 27 press conference, "It is
  necessary to limit, then to neutralize and finally suppress the control of the national
  economy by the big industrialists and estate owners," militant words, indeed, coming
  from him. Although this gradualist approach is said to be already drafted into the new
  economic law, it is nevertheless significant that Cunhal should now bring it up,
  bearing in mind that he himself has said that the country is now going through a
  "decisive stage" of the Portuguese revolution.</p>

  <p><strong>Who will do it?</strong></p>

  <p>But the larger question, the one that towers over everything else, especially over
  programmatic announcements of what will be done, is who is going to do it? This is the
  key to Portuguese politics at the present time. The CP's strategy of coalition with the
  SP and the PPD is one thing &mdash; and for the moment that coalition is all but broken
  up. The basic coalition, the key to CP politics, is its alliance with the Armed Forces
  Movement.</p>

  <p>Unquestionably the CP has friends, sympathizers, and members in the armed forces,
  but its alliance with the AFM is an alliance with a section of the officer corps.</p>

  <p>An army is a faithful replica of class stratification in capitalist society. It
  would be a renunciation of Marxism to deny this elementary truth. The peasants and the
  workers are among the conscripted soldiers; the officers generally come from the middle
  class and the bourgeoisie. In a broad way they represent and respond to the class
  interests from whence they came. Of course, here and there officers, even in the
  American army and especially during the Vietnam war, have turned against the military
  brass, against the government, etc. Individual members of the officer corps, especially
  in a country which has such a vast number of Communists, inevitably are drawn to the
  side of the oppressed.. But class groupings as a whole in a showdown crisis respond to
  their class.</p>

  <p>For this reason, to rely solely and so heavily on the AFM in a time of crisis is to
  surrender the initiative of the masses and depend on maneuvers in the military, banking
  on individual military leaders &mdash; and in the end to succumb to paralysis in the
  event of a right-wing coup. But Cunhal, like the rest of the CP leaders, sees
  "cooperation between the popular movement and the AFM as the dynamic element" &mdash;
  as the only guarantee against a fascist coup. "Isolated from each other," says Cunhal,
  these two movements would be powerless to carry out the fundamental transformation of
  Portuguese society which is on the order of the day.</p>

  <p><strong>What if AFM breaks?</strong></p>

  <p>There is no doubt that Cunhal relies completely on the unity of the two movements.
  But suppose there is a break in the AFM, as the capitalist press is daily
  rumor-mongering. Then what? There is no evidence, at least none available in this
  country, which would indicate that the party is making any independent preparation or
  arming the workers for that eventuality.</p>

  <p>One can only hope that, given the gravity of the situation and the long suffering of
  the masses under the Salazar and Caetano dictatorships and the sense of self-confidence
  obtained since the April 25 coup, any attempt to reestablish a fascist regime will
  arouse the instinctive and spontaneous drive of the workers and the popular masses
  generally, and force the working class organizations into a combative, militant, united
  front for a victorious socialist revolution.</p>
