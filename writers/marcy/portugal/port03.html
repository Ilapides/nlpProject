  <h1>Portugal &mdash; who will strike first?</h1>

  <p><em>By Sam Marcy</em></p>

  <h4>February 17, 1975</h4>

  <p>With the announcement by the Provisional government that elections to the
  Constituent Assembly will take place on April 12, the Portuguese revolution has entered
  its truly critical phase.</p>

  <p>Normally, the setting of a definite date for the convocation of a Constituent
  Assembly should ease political tensions and quiet rumors of another right-wing coup in
  the making. However, the opposite is turning out to be all too true.</p>

  <p>A second version of the September 28 abortive coup attempt is obviously out of the
  question. It will be remembered that on that date General Spinola attempted a military
  coup. He tried to mask it by staging a Mussolini-type fascist mobilization in Lisbon
  under the guise of a call to the "silent majority to avert a left-wing
  dictatorship."</p>

  <p><strong>Sept. 28 &mdash; workers turned back fascists</strong></p>

  <p>The attempt failed because the CP and its allied organizations mobilized workers,
  students, and soldiers who successfully turned back the demonstrators. Spinola
  resigned, two small outright fascist organizations dissolved, and their leaders were
  arrested along with several hundred low ranking officials and military leaders.</p>

  <p>It should be added that alongside the CP and its allies, all other working class
  organizations to the left of the CP enthusiastically participated in the call to stop
  the fascist mobilization. It was, however, undeniably a CP initiative which evoked the
  massive working class demonstration which stopped the abortive coup.</p>

  <p><strong>Upsurge everywhere</strong></p>

  <p>A militant resurgence of the working class movement has held sway in principal
  industrial centers of Portugal ever since. Land seizures by landless peasants in recent
  weeks have shown an upsurge of the struggle in rural areas. The events in Oporto, where
  thousands of militant workers and students broke up the convention of the Christian
  Democratic Center, a neo-fascist organization, have heightened the working class
  upsurge, which was capped by the giant anti-NATO demonstration in Lisbon on January 31,
  held in defiance of a government decree banning demonstrations.</p>

  <p>A call to another fascist mobilization to cover a right-wing military coup is
  therefore most unlikely. A new fascist conspiracy would have to be tried differently,
  but there is no question that the center of the right-wing plotting is in the upper
  echelons of the military. That is where the hope of the possessing classes lies; that
  is who they are banking on.</p>

  <p>The possessing classes, however, are in complete disarray. Their political
  institutions, as well as their leaders, stand discredited by decades of fascist
  collaboration, and many have fled the country. Others have put on the mask of democracy
  merely to get a hearing.</p>

  <p><strong>Fascists look to imperialism for rescue</strong></p>

  <p>The bulk of the ruling class is in an exceptionally weakened position. Their main
  source, in fact their sole hope for support, lies in the concerted effort of the
  leading imperialist powers, headed by the U.S. to bring about a counter-revolutionary
  overturn.</p>

  <p>Hence, the most severe external pressure by the leading European imperialist powers,
  and most of all by the U.S., is being brought to, bear on Portugal. It is now 3 weeks
  since NATO naval maneuvers took place on the coast of the Iberian peninsula, involving
  simulated bombing and invasion of Portugal. Nevertheless, 19 ships including the U.S.
  aircraft carrier Saratoga are still prowling in the vicinity of the Portuguese
  coastline.</p>

  <p>The most striking feature of this NATO naval exercise was that it marked the first
  time that NATO has been used as an instrument of counter-revolutionary subversion
  against a European country which it has pledged to defend. NATO, it must be remembered,
  was ostensibly set up solely as an anti-Soviet military alliance. But here, for the
  first time, it demonstrated that one of its principal purposes is to stem the tide of
  revolutionary working class upsurge.</p>

  <p><strong>Haig and NATO</strong></p>

  <p>Not to be forgotten is the fact that the present NATO commander is none other than
  General Alexander Haig, Nixon's former White House Chief-of-Staff, and Kissinger's
  principal deputy during the Vietnam negotiations.</p>

  <p>Haig was a key figure in the October 1973 "Saturday night massacre" when Nixon tried
  to pull a near-coup, firing Elliot Richardson, then Attorney General, Archibald Cox,
  Special Watergate Prosecutor, and William Ruckelshaus, Deputy Attorney General.</p>

  <p>Haig has kept a low profile in his new post, especially as regards Portugal. But
  C.R. Sulzberger of the <em>New York Times</em> (Feb. 15, 1975) credits him with "taking
  quiet initiatives" as NATO Commander and, in particular, of "smoothing out wrinkles in
  relationships with France."</p>

  <p>This is profoundly significant since France has really been half way out of NATO and
  not participating for the most part in any NATO military exercises.</p>

  <p>However, French naval units participated with the other NATO powers in the maneuvers
  aimed at Portugal. Thus a counter-revolutionary front of the leading imperialist
  powers, composed of Britain, West Germany, Canada, and France, and headed by the U.S.,
  was fashioned with the aim of subverting the Portuguese revolution.</p>

  <p><strong>And covert subversion</strong></p>

  <p>Along with these military moves, the imperialist powers have flooded Portugal with a
  variety of political leaders from the West European social-democratic parties,
  calculated to bolster up the pro-imperialist stand of the Portuguese Socialist Party
  (IPSP), as well as that of the more reactionary Popular Democratic Party (PPD). Both
  parties are in the coalition government and are regarded as the most reliable social
  supports of the ruling class and of NATO.</p>

  <p>Irving Browne of the AFL-CIO has been there to "help" the unions, that is, to
  subvert them on behalf of the CIA and split them as was done during the 1946-48 period
  in France and Italy.</p>

  <p>It is enough to quote Francisco sa Carneiro, leader of the PPD, whose recent
  pronouncements of alarm at the growth of revolutionary sentiment among the masses sound
  more like an open call for imperialist intervention than a description of the political
  situation.</p>

  <p>"An atmosphere of suspicion and hate has been created," said Carneiro, "which has
  led to permanent disquiet and the impossibility of permanent cooperation. We cannot go
  on living in a climate of civil war. We can no longer tolerate the escalation of
  revolutionary language."</p>

  <p><strong>Constituent Assembly and imperialist aims</strong></p>

  <p>It is in this light that we must see the convocation of the Constituent Assembly.
  The imperialists are not concerned with legal niceties of bourgeois parliamentarism.
  They are preparing to strike &mdash; a blow, either through a military coup, through
  open military intervention or some combination of the two.</p>

  <p>The false alarm sounded in the <em>New York Times</em> editorial of February 17
  &mdash; that the CP is planning violence and a Communist takeover before the election
  to the Constituent Assembly &mdash; is a smokescreen, calculated to cover the covert
  operations of the CIA and the military intervention planned by Washington and its
  European partners.</p>

  <p>The State Department just this last week published documents showing that on Feb. 8,
  1948, the National Security Council of the U.S. had before it a plan which "recommended
  the full use of political, economic, and if necessary, military measures to prevent a
  communist takeover in Italy." This partial revelation of how the Pentagon and the State
  Department were working feverishly to preserve the domination of the Italian
  bourgeoisie and American finance capital does not show what actual measures were taken.
  But it is clear from subsequent events that the U.S. used everything short of military
  intervention to defend its imperialist interests.</p>

  <p>One need not wonder why the revelation was made at this time. It was meant as a
  threat to both Portugal and the USSR. In case this was not understood as such, the
  <em>New York Times</em> editorial referred to above makes it explicit.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"A Communist takeover of Portugal," said the <em>New York Times</em> on February
    17, "might encourage a similar trend in Italy and France, create problems in Greece
    and Turkey, affect the succession in Spain and Yugoslavia and send tremors throughout
    Western Europe." The Soviet Union is then warned that "detente will be the first
    casualty."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the face of brutal frankness and open threats, can there be any doubt that the
  imperialist powers are preparing the ground for another Chile on the Iberian Peninsula?
  Do not the working class parties have the right &mdash; in fact the sacred duty &mdash;
  to prepare the mass of the people in advance for precisely this eventuality in the kind
  of manner which would put an end not merely to fascist threats, but to the ruling class
  and the system of exploitation upon which it rests?</p>

  <p>The way Lenin and Trotsky prepared for the Constituent Assembly in 1917 offers an
  exceptionally instructive lesson. While utilizing all the legal and electoral
  opportunities offered, the Bolsheviks, knowing full well the counter-revolutionary
  nature of the bourgeoisie, armed the masses ideologically, politically, and physically
  for the insurrection. It was thus that they put an end to bourgeois rule and
  transferred the real power into the hands of the workers and peasants.<br /></p>
