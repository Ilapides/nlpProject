  <h1>Portugal's July Days</h1>

  <p><em>By Sam Marcy</em></p>

  <h4>July 22, 1975</h4>

  <p>The Portuguese Revolution is now going through the agony of its "July days. "
  Communist Party headquarters in ten cities all across Northern Portugal have either
  been sacked or burned. Progressive newspapers are being hindered from distribution.
  Many revolutionary militants and progressive activists have had to take cover against
  mob violence. Others have gone into hiding. A wild witch hunt is in full progress,
  fueled by bourgeois reaction and clerical obscurantism. As always, persecution weakens
  some, strengthens others, and confusion takes a high toll.</p>

  <p>It was all set off by a week-long series of demonstrations called under the banner
  of the Socialist Party (SP) but basically gathering together hundreds of thousands of
  reactionary elements, many of whom just a few weeks ago would not have dared to take to
  the streets. Nevertheless, these demonstrations have failed in their principal
  objective. The aim was to topple the government. They failed to achieve this.</p>

  <p><strong>Split in junta</strong></p>

  <p>They did, however, bring to the surface the deep split in the governing junta. It
  was shown without a doubt that President Gomes, Foreign Minister Antunes, Admiral Vitor
  Crespo, Captain Lourenco, and others constitute a right-wing, bourgeois military
  grouping. In opposition are the more progressive junior officers in the governing
  council of the Armed Forces Movement (AFM).</p>

  <p>Gomes's readiness to displace Premier Goncalves in a new Cabinet with the Socialists
  and Popular Democrats, probably to the exclusion of the Portuguese CP and Portuguese
  Democratic Movement (MDP), constitutes an open breach. This was made clear when Gomes
  issued a statement saying a new Cabinet would be formed which "would respect the will
  of the Portuguese people and create the need to give representation to various currents
  of socialist political thought."</p>

  <p>The phrase "respect for the will of the Portuguese people" is a catchword used by
  the Socialist Party as a rallying slogan for the rightists. Gomes's use of this phrase
  clearly refers to Mario Soares and his colleagues and does not embrace Marxist or
  revolutionary "currents of socialist political thought."</p>

  <p>The SP is not opposed to the whole military &mdash; only to the left wing of it, of
  which they consider Premier Goncalves to be the principal leader and an exponent of
  communist ideology.</p>

  <p><strong>Struggle over Goncalves</strong></p>

  <p>According to today's <em>New York Times,</em> the recent publication of a speech by
  Goncalves to the Armed Forces General Assembly "has helped to explain why battle lines
  have been so acutely drawn." Goncalves is quoted as having said that the principal
  problem of socialism was "the taking of power by the workers." Moreover, he is said to
  have stated that this entails leadership by a vanguard of the workers. Of course, he
  meant the CP. But he added that that includes other organizations that fight for real
  socialism, which he defined as "the domination of the workers over the means of
  production and over the conditions of their existence."</p>

  <p>It is this view that is apparently at the bottom of the crisis that caused the SP to
  break from the Cabinet along with the PPD, because if acted upon this view would
  actually mean the dictatorship of the proletariat and a workers government. This
  explains the furious opposition of the SP and, of course, the PPD, both of whom are
  really committed to the bourgeois system. This is why Soares has become the darling of
  international finance capital and is embraced by the entire bourgeoisie. And this
  explains why Soares has said that Goncalve is the key to the problem.</p>

  <p>The pressure of the counter-revolutionary demonstrations brought to the fore a line
  of political differentiation, long building up in the military, which has now reached
  the boiling point. Only the intervention of the more progressive military leaders who
  are concentrated in what is called the Fifth Division, the political arm of the AFM,
  has momentarily made it possible to paper over the split. A communique from the Fifth
  Division strongly supported Premier Goncalves and by implication rejected Gomes's move
  for a new cabinet.</p>

  <p>It is widely reported that the so-called moderates (bourgeois elements) have a
  majority in the High Council of the Revolution. However, in a revolutionary, showdown
  struggle, this is not at all what counts. What counts is, whom will the rank-and-file
  soldiers and sailors follow? Will they respond to a revolutionary call to defend the
  socialist revolution in the struggle against fascism, or will they become pawns of the
  counter-revolution? This basically is the issue.</p>

  <p>About 10 percent of the old military were purged. Percentages alone, however, don't
  count. It depends on who among them has influence and material forces to rally in the
  counter-revolution.</p>

  <p><strong>SP cover for counter-revolution</strong></p>

  <p>The SP demonstrations were understood everywhere in the imperialist world to be
  <strong>not protests against the bourgeois military as such, but against
  communism.</strong></p>

  <p>While the thrust of the demonstrations was against Goncalves, it was clear in the
  Oporto as well as in the Lisbon demonstrations that these mobilizations were
  anti-communist and anti-working class in character. They were in fact preparations for
  a counterrevolution. The fact that they fell short of their projected goal gives the
  working class and its political organizations the opportunity to resume the initiative,
  to launch a new revolutionary working class offensive.</p>

  <p>It is entirely possible that these demonstrations constitute the high-water mark of
  the counterrevolution's so-called popular support. It was fortunate that the military
  did not provoke a street struggle against the demonstrators. It would have been a
  tragic error that could have unleashed the right-wing military coup for which the SP
  demonstrations were supposed to be the popular cover.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, there has been a shift to the right in the military. The military is
  and has been a bourgeois institution. It faithfully reflects the class stratifications
  in bourgeois society. By and large the officer corps, such as Gomes, Antunes, Crespo,
  and others, are the guardians of the bourgeois order, this acute class struggle in the
  country cannot but result in at least some of the progressive officers responding to
  the class needs of the workers, peasants, and the poor.</p>

  <p>A split in the military is absolutely inevitable. It is just a question as to when
  and how it takes place and under what circumstances. The political organizations of the
  workers can and must assert their class independence and utilize such allies within the
  military as they can find, but above all they must concentrate on the rank-and-file
  soldiers and sailors.</p>

  <p><strong>Still time to stop it</strong></p>

  <p>Unless the right-wing in the military acts immediately under the aegis of the U.S.
  and the Western Allies, there still remains ample opportunity to stop the
  counter-revolution and regain the political initiative by slowly starting to build the
  working class defense organizations.</p>

  <p>Advantage must be taken of the already existing popular committees composed of
  workers, organized in the shops the neighborhoods etc. They must be made nationwide in
  character and draw in all strata of the oppressed. They must be given wide initiative
  to continue the takeover of all aspects of the economy.</p>

  <p>The Socialist Workers Party over here, in its paper <em>The Militant,</em> falls in
  with world reaction again in characterizing the proposed people's committees as
  "totalitarian." Instead it calls for a parliamentary coalition of the CP and SP. But
  there had been a coalition between these two parties all along! It is the SP, which is
  opposed to the radical measures being taken against the capitalists and landlords, that
  in effect is demanding that the CP be ousted from the coalition with its attacks on CP
  headquarters and its slogan of "Goncalves out!"</p>

  <p><strong>Bosses continue to sabotage economy</strong></p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie is continuing to deliberately sabotage production. The principal
  economic organizations of the bourgeoisie are defying the government insolently handing
  it ultimatums, blaming the workers for the economic chaos in the country, calling upon
  them for more and more sacrifices.</p>

  <p>The economic situation will surely pass from the stage of deterioration at the
  present time to that of collapse if the bourgeoisie is permitted to sabotage industries
  and the workers are not given full political control of the economy.</p>

  <p>Every effort must be made to make arms available to the popular committees and to
  forge and strengthen fraternal relations with the rank-and-file soldiers and sailors.
  No form of economic aid from abroad can now appreciably change the character of the
  economic crisis. The entire struggle is now political in character.</p>

  <p>The counter-revolution having made its major political thrust, the arena of the
  struggle will now shift to other areas. The <em>New York Times</em> of July 19 and the
  <em>Washington Post</em> of July 20 have now both admitted that a veritable army of
  thousands of fascist elements is training for intervention from nearby Spain. Elements
  from among the soldiers and sailors returning from Mozambique are speculated to be
  possible fertile soil for counter-revolutionary insurgency.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, the status quo politically economically and militarily is
  absolutely impossible. A country so sharply divided along class lines and locked in
  most acute incipient struggle is pregnant either with proletarian revolution or a
  resurgence of fascist military rule. A bourgeois parliamentary solution, which is
  feverishly being sought behind the scenes, can only be a brief interval between the
  two.</p>

  <p>Now, in the interim, is the time to build what in reality amounts to a Portuguese
  form of Soviets, in embryo. Such are the small, modest beginnings of the popular
  committees. It remains for the Portuguese CP and other left-wing militant political
  organizations of the workers to block together and carry out this task in this hour of
  peril.</p>

  <p><strong>Remember?</strong></p>

  <p>The international capitalist furor over the seizure of the paper <em>Republica</em>
  by left-wing workers in Portugal was conspicuously absent last summer when a left-wing
  paper was closed. At that time the rightist forces in the government gathered around
  General Spinola not only banned a newspaper but arrested its editor Luis Saldanha
  Sanches, because he had called on Portuguese troops not to fight in Africa.</p>

  <p>There was no international "democratic" outcry then. There were no ads in the
  <em>New York Times.</em> The very reactionary forces who today are rallying under the
  phony cover of "democracy" and "plurality" were perfectly content to see a critic on
  the left stifled.<br /></p>
