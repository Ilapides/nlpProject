  <h5>Portugal &mdash; Revolutionary Developments April 1974-Dec. 1975 [Sam Marcy]</h5>

  <h1>Portugal &mdash; another momentous week</h1>

  <p><em>By Sam Marcy</em></p>

  <h4>February 1, 1975</h4>

  <p>Once again, as has happened on so many previous occasions since the April 25
  overthrow of the fascist dictatorship, Portugal has passed through a week of high
  tension and intense political maneuvering in the Cabinet and in the Coordinating
  Committee of the Armed Forces Movement (AFM), capped by land seizures by landless
  peasants and a giant demonstration of workers in Lisbon.</p>

  <p>The demonstration in Lisbon, which numbered more than 10,000 workers and marched
  through the center of the city, passing the U.S. Embassy, was in deliberate defiance of
  a government decree banning all demonstrations. This demonstration was therefore of
  special significance, not only because it was large, but because it was composed mainly
  of revolutionary and militant organizations to the left of the Portuguese CP. The size
  of the demonstration and the fact that the government did not move against the
  demonstrators was an embarrassment to the CP and undermined its standing from the
  left.</p>

  <p>A principal chant by the demonstrators was directed against the NATO naval exercises
  in which American, British, French, Canadian, West German, and Portuguese units
  participated.</p>

  <p><strong>'Simulated' NATO intervention</strong></p>

  <p>The guns and armor of the American aircraft carrier Saratoga stood out menacingly
  within sight of Commerce Square, opposite where most of the workers had assembled. This
  had to arouse the greatest indignation, not only from the demonstrators but from all
  Portuguese workers, especially when one remembers that the CP itself has stood out so
  long and undeviatingly against NATO. Yet one must wonder-how could the Armed Forces
  Movement agree to the participation of Portuguese naval units in an exercise which
  involved simulated bombings of central Portugal? And how can the Provisional government
  at this very late date still be a member of NATO, especially when the Pentagon has
  contemptuously barred the Portuguese armed forces from any so-called secret NATO
  material?</p>

  <p>It is to be remembered that as early as April 29 of last year, barely a few days
  after the overthrow of the fascist dictatorship, a meeting took place of 700 naval
  officers who endorsed the program of the AFM and as a result secured the removal of 82
  admirals and vice-admirals from the navy. This included a purge of the notorious
  Admiral Tenreiro, owner of one of Portugal's largest fishing fleets, who was
  subsequently arrested and imprisoned. Indeed, it was precisely by the navy itself that
  a good part of the naval brass was purged.</p>

  <p>If even this branch of the armed forces, where so many !of the fascist officers had
  been purged, did not make felt its opposition to naval maneuvers directed specifically
  against Portugal, then how can the AFM be regarded as a force representing or
  responsive to the popular masses, as the CP coalition would have us believe? On the
  contrary, the acquiescence to the provocative NATO exercises represents a danger. It
  shows that a rightist, pro-imperialist tendency predominates in the Provisional
  government as presently constituted. Is this what Mario Soares, the leader of the
  Socialist Party who is constantly forecasting (really threatening) civil war, as he did
  just recently in the struggle over the trade union laws, has in mind?</p>

  <p><strong>What is NATO?</strong></p>

  <p>NATO was conceived as an imperialist instrument directed against the USSR. In
  addition, although not as well publicized, it was intended to be an instrument to
  suppress internal revolutions in Europe. Only lately has this feature of NATO come to
  the fore.</p>

  <p>The naval exercise, involving simulating bombings of central Portugal was obviously
  a counter-revolutionary exercise against the Portuguese people. Even those elements in
  the coalition government who may be anti-Soviet had absolutely no ground for
  countenancing this military maneuver.</p>

  <p>The fact that naval units of the Portuguese armed forces did indeed participate in
  it is therefore highly significant. Foreign policy is an extension of domestic policy;
  military maneuvers are an expression of that foreign policy and aim to give it force.
  The participation of Portugal's armed forces in the NATO exercise tells us a great deal
  about the preponderant class forces in the Provisional government and the AFM
  itself.</p>

  <p><strong>Emergency economic law</strong></p>

  <p>The Emergency Economic Law which had been promised for many, many weeks now, and
  which had been in the discussion stage at least since June, was finally passed by the
  Cabinet of the Provisional government on February 8. This law enacts an agricultural
  reform which is supposed to give land to the peasants from estates where the landlords
  have long been absent or have run away under the impact of the militant struggle of the
  landless peasants</p>

  <p>The law is also supposed to limit the giant firms and monopolies and restrict them
  in relation to profits and prices. 'But as far as the peasants are concerned, the
  measure promulgated on February 8 in reality merely validates measures that have
  already been taken independently by the peasants. The slogan of "land to those who till
  it" had caught the imagination of the peasants and been acted upon before February 8,
  but its validation in law is bound to give a new impetus to the struggle against the
  landlords and big estate holders.</p>

  <p><strong>Masses on the offensive</strong></p>

  <p>The fact that the peasants have organized an agricultural workers' association,
  although deeply influenced by the CP and some of its allies, is a remarkable sign of
  the growing upsurge in the countryside along with the resurgence in all the industrial
  centers of Portugal. Indeed, everywhere the forces of reaction and counter-revolution
  are on the defensive. This is the one absolutely indisputable fact that dominates the
  Portuguese political situation at present.</p>

  <p>Not without reason does the <em>New York Times</em> of February 10 lament that
  "anti-communism is hard to sustain these days. Those who practice it are immediately
  branded as reactionaries and as partisans of the old regime."</p>

  <p>But while the upsurge of the popular masses continues, the situation is extremely
  unstable. It is not possible for the so-called Emergency Economic Law to solve or
  materially improve the economic situation of the country. The reforms are of very
  limited character and do not go to the heart of the basic property relations between
  exploiter and exploited. They limit the monopolies but do not eliminate the monopolist
  class. Even the reforms themselves remain to be effectuated. Only in areas where the
  workers and the peasants have themselves taken matters into their own hands do the
  reforms have any real meaning.</p>

  <p>They do, however, as all such reform legislation does in revolutionary situations,
  provide an impetus for mass activity and for <strong>extra-legal measures taken by the
  masses.</strong> Unemployment (200,000 in a country of only 8.5 million) plus galloping
  inflation continue to take their toll, and this without letup. It is characteristic of
  a revolutionary situation that neither of the basic classes forming the structure of
  capitalist society can long endure the status quo. Both classes are in rebellion
  against the status quo. Such is the situation in Portugal today.</p>

  <p>As Lenin put it, "neither class can go on living as before." This alone creates the
  premise for a revolutionary crisis.</p>

  <p><strong>Relation between CP and armed forces</strong></p>

  <p>A distinctive feature of the coalition backing the Provisional government lies in
  the relationship between the CP and the Armed Forces Movement. Unlike during the
  popular front of the 1930s, the CP now has a stronger hold in the armed forces. This is
  the key to its strength in the coalition. But it is of a purely derivative type. Its
  strength in the mass movement, with a huge following among the workers and peasants, is
  what gives the CP a degree of strength in the military, and not the other way around.
  But the CP's policy utilizes this strength to mask class collaboration with the
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>It must not be forgotten that the other parties, even the MRPP, also have some
  strength in the armed forces. But it is the reliance by the CP on the coalition with
  the AFM, more specifically with the officer corps, which marks it out as a medium of
  class collaboration and holds out limitless dangers in the event of another attempted
  coup by the right-wing.</p>

  <p><strong>Gain of leftists</strong></p>

  <p>However, as matters stand now the CP is gaining in the rural areas &mdash; as
  witness its mass support at the February 9 Evora demonstration. Evora is the center of
  the Alentejo region, an agricultural area properly called the breadbasket of Portugal.
  But in the industrial areas the CP is losing strength to more militant and
  revolutionary organizations further to the left. The Lisbon anti-NATO demonstration was
  not only an embarrassment to the CP, it undermined its strength and showed that the
  pendulum in the mass movement is moving leftward away from the class collaborationist
  policy of the CP.</p>

  <p>The greatest hopes for a resolution of the conflict in Portugal lie in the
  realization of the need for a broad working class united front by those political
  organizations which can take on the historic responsibility to meet the challenge which
  the possessing classes are surely preparing. It makes imperative the need to arm the
  proletariat, not only politically and ideologically, but physically.<br /></p>
