  <h5>Portugal &mdash; Revolutionary Developments April 1974-Dec. 1975 [Sam Marcy]</h5>

  <h1>Portugal: class war in the barracks</h1>

  <p><em>By Sam Marcy</em></p>

  <h4>October 7, 1975</h4>

  <p>At last, at last, the class struggle has broken out in Portugal in the most
  sensitive and most decisive area of bourgeois society &mdash; the military
  establishment. With almost lightning speed, the rank-and-file soldiers in Portugal are
  asserting themselves against the officer corps. The demand for what is now called in
  the armed forces "internal democracy" is sweeping all the military garrisons and bases
  in the country &mdash; north and south.</p>

  <p>The <em>New York Times</em> of October 4 ruefully admits that the military rank and
  file are demanding and exercising the right "to discuss and determine every military
  decision" and this "has been asserted in all the country's major regions during the
  last 24 hours." A truly stupendous development! It's a real breakthrough for the
  revolution. It opens wide the gates to a working class transformation of Portuguese
  society.</p>

  <p><strong>Began in response to government moves</strong></p>

  <p>As almost always in previous revolutions, it was the whip of the counter-revolution
  that urged the revolution forward in Portugal. It was the ill-fated moves to assert the
  authority of the Sixth Provisional Government, headed by Admiral Azevedo, which
  provoked the revolutionary storm among the rank-and-file soldiers.</p>

  <p>When he sent military units to take over the Lisbon radio stations, the soldiers
  refused to dislodge the workers on the staffs and editorial boards and instead
  fraternized with them.</p>

  <p>This sent a revolutionary tremor throughout the entire military establishment. It
  was the first open break with the military hierarchy.</p>

  <p>The ferment of the rank and file is not confined to the Lisbon area alone, as the
  capitalist press claimed earlier when it railed against a "small minority" in some
  units on the outskirts of Lisbon. It is true, of course, that the Ralis light artillery
  regiment is on the outskirts of Lisbon and it is the Ralis regiment that set up the big
  anti-tank guns and mounted soldiers with automatic rifles right outside its barracks on
  October 5. Of course, this was occasioned by a deliberate fabrication by Socialist
  Party leaders that extreme left-wing elements and Communists were plotting a coup. In
  reality, it was the SP leaders and the right-wing military camarilla in the government
  who were seeking to dissolve the revolutionary military units.</p>

  <p><strong>Giving arms to workers</strong></p>

  <p>The "military dissidence," as the <em>New York Times</em> calls it, is deep and
  widespread. It has struck fear into the hearts of the Antunes Azevedo-Gomes government
  Now the government is even more worried about the flow of arms into civilian
  working-class hands, handed out by friendly units in the armed forces. Virtually
  thousands of guns, particularly G machine guns plus ammunition, have been distributed
  by the soldiers to the workers.</p>

  <p>The demand by the rank-and-file troops for the right to virtually make their own
  military decisions has split the military along class lines. Of course, not all the
  soldiers, sailors, and marines have moved over to the left &mdash; to the
  revolutionary, working class side. Nor has every military commander moved over to the
  right. But on the whole, the so-called "military dissidence" has opened wide a class
  struggle in the barracks which was previously muffled.</p>

  <p><strong>False "unity" discarded</strong></p>

  <p>As far as appearances went, the military was seen as a paragon of unity. Military
  commanders and rank and file were one, and the Armed Forces Movement (AFM) was its
  organized political expression. The AFM was passed off as virtually a non-class or
  supra-class social phenomenon.</p>

  <p>This was never really true. And the ascendancy of the Antunes Azevedo-Gomes military
  clique tore the mask of false unity off the face of the governing officer corps, which
  had utilized the AFM as a screen until they were able to discard it.</p>

  <p>The awakening of the rank-and-file soldiers and the inability of the Azevedo
  government to enforce its orders have exposed it as being isolated from the popular
  masses, who regard the government as their class enemy. Such is the revolutionary
  ferment among the troops that, no less than President Gomes himself is forced to use
  the language of the class struggle in order to try to foist upon the soldiers the
  reactionary discipline of his military clique. But to no avail.</p>

  <p>Only 2 weeks ago, the Azevedo government seemed to have the country in its hands.
  Today, it appears shorn of authority indecisive and incapable of enforcing its
  authority Most of all it is fearful of the wrath of the masses.</p>

  <p><strong>Break from the government</strong></p>

  <p>It is precisely at such a time of a confluence of auspicious circumstances for a
  working class seizure of power that the traditional parties of the working class are
  showing more clearly than ever their reluctance to cut the umbilical cord which binds
  them to the capitalist government.</p>

  <p>The Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) still holds a cabinet post in the Azevedo
  government. It matters not that it is only one cabinet minister sitting unofficially or
  that the PCP puts up a struggle here and there against the Azevedo government, The main
  thing is that it continues to support the government precisely at a time when it is
  most urgent to cut its ties with it completely and throw in its lot with the
  masses.</p>

  <p>General Otelo Carvalho too, although shorn of some military authority, proclaims
  that he is for the revolution and the masses &mdash; but nevertheless says he still
  supports the Sixth Provisional Government.</p>

  <p>"Make a class choice, Otelo," shouted the masses to him at a demonstration last
  week. But Otelo to this day is still part and parcel of the provisional government.
  Some of the Maoists, too, such as the PCP (Marxist-Leninist), support Antunes and hence
  the Sixth Provisional Government.</p>

  <p>In these decisive days, there is only one over-riding issue &mdash; are you for or
  against the provisional government? Support for the provisional government, no matter
  how qualified, no matter how tenuous, aids and abets the cause of the bourgeoisie and
  helps wittingly or unwittingly , consciously or unconsciously, bring about the fascist
  coup Washington and its imperialist allies are plotting.</p>

  <p>Time, however, is the essence of the matter. Only a few weeks ago when the
  counter-revolution seemed to be growing by leaps and bounds with the burnings,
  wreckings, and wanton destruction of the PCP headquarters, some hand-picked units
  selected by the military camarilla seemed to standby while mercenaries of the
  counter-revolution did their wrecking and burning.</p>

  <p>Now the situation has radically changed. It is clear that the soldiers, sailors, and
  marines are not the easy minions of the right-wing military that the ruling class press
  thought they would be. The situation cries out for a drastic re-alliance of working
  class forces to reach out to the soldiers and make a wide, united class front to
  overthrow the reactionary landlord and monopolist servants of imperialism and bring
  about the socialist transformation of Portugal.</p>

  <p><strong>Lesson from Commune</strong></p>

  <p>In one of his last introductions to <em>The Civil War in France,</em> Engels said
  something about the Proudhonists and the Blanquists which is apropos to present-day
  Portugal. In the interests of the revolution and of the Commune, said Engels, the
  Proudhonists abandoned the dogma of "free association" and an antipathy to all
  centralism. The Blanquists, on the other hand, were forced by the course of events to
  abandon their total reliance on conspiratorial methods and were obliged to take into
  account the role of the masses in the struggle for the revolution.</p>

  <p>In like fashion, it is time for the PCP to abandon its class collaborationist
  policy, as it is time for the Maoists to junk their social-fascism and false
  "superpower" theory. But these dogmas are no less of an ideological obstruction to the
  victory of the revolution than were Proudhonism and Blanquism during the Paris
  Commune.<br /></p>
