  <h5>Generals over the White House [Sam Marcy]</h5>

  <h1>Appendix A</h1>

  <p><em>The following is a memorandum by Dwight D. Eisenhower who was General and Chief of
  Staff of the U.S. Army in 1946. This memo proposes what amounts to the virtual
  integration of the Army, civilian scientists, technologists, industry and the
  universities. A close reading of this memo will show that there is little room for
  doubt that what it proposes is a fusion of industry, science and the military. The
  practice of the Army in the succeeding years fully confirms this. The memo is reprinted
  with permission from the Henry L. Stimson Papers in the Sterling Library of Yale
  University. [S.M.]</em></p>

  <h3>Memorandum for Directors and Chiefs of War Department, General and Special Staff
  Divisions and Bureaus and the Commanding Generals of the Major Commands</h3>

  <p>Subject: <em>Scientific and Technological Resources as Military Assets.</em></p>

  <p>The recent conflict has demonstrated more convincingly than ever before the strength
  our nation can best derive from the integration of all of our national resources in
  time of war. It is of the utmost importance that the lessons of this experience be not
  forgotten in the peacetime planning and training of the Army. The future security of
  the nation demands that all those civilian resources which by conversion or redirection
  constitute our main support in time of emergency be associated closely with the
  activities of the Army in time of peace.</p>

  <p>The lessons of the last war are clear. The military effort required for victory
  threw upon the Army an unprecedented range of responsibilities, many of which were
  effectively discharged only through the invaluable assistance supplied by our
  cumulative resources in the natural and social sciences and the talents and experience
  furnished by management and labor. The armed forces could not have won the war alone.
  Scientists and business men contributed techniques and weapons which enabled us to
  outwit and overwhelm the enemy. Their understanding of the Army's needs made possible
  the highest degree of cooperation. This pattern of integration must be translated into
  a peacetime counterpart which will not merely familiarize the Army with the progress
  made in science and industry, but draw into our planning for national security all the
  civilian resources which can contribute to the defense of the country.</p>

  <p>Success in this enterprise depends to a large degree on the cooperation which the
  nation as a whole is willing to contribute. However, the Army as one of the main
  agencies responsible for the defense of the nation has the duty to take the initiative
  in promoting closer relations between civilian and military interests It must establish
  definite policies and administrative leadership which will make possible even greater
  contributions from science, technology, and management than during the last war.</p>

  <p>In order to ensure the full use of our national resources in case of emergency, the
  following general policies will be put into effect:</p>

  <p>(1) <em>The Army must have civilian assistance in military planning as well as for
  the production of weapons.</em> Effective long-range military planning can be done only
  in the light of predicted developments in science and technology. As further scientific
  achievements accelerate the tempo and expand the area of our operations, this
  interrelationship will become of even greater importance. In the past we have often
  deprived ourselves of vital help by limiting our use of scientific and technological
  resources to contracts for equipment. More often than not we can find much of the
  talent we need for comprehensive planning in industry or universities. Proper
  employment of this talent requires that the civilian agency shall have the benefit of
  our estimates of future military problems and shall work closely with Plans and the
  Research and Development authorities. A most effective procedure is the letting of
  contracts for aid in planning. The use of such a procedure will greatly enhance the
  validity of our planning as well as ensure sounder strategic equipment programs.</p>

  <p>(2) <em>Scientists and industrialists must be given the greatest possible freedom to
  carry out their research.</em> The fullest utilization by the Army of the civilian
  resources of the nation cannot be procured merely by prescribing the military
  characteristics and requirements of certain types of equipment Scientists and
  industrialists are more likely to make new and unsuspected contributions to the
  development of the Army if detailed directions are held to a minimum. The solicitation
  of assistance under these conditions would not only make available to the Army talents
  and experience otherwise beyond our reach, but also establish mutual confidence between
  ourselves and civilians. It would familiarize them with our fundamental problems and
  strengthen greatly the foundation upon which our national security depends.</p>

  <p>(3) <em>The possibility of utilizing some of our industrial and technological
  resources as organic parts of our military structure in time of emergency should be
  carefully examined.</em> The degree of cooperation with science and industry achieved
  during the recent war should by no means be considered the ultimate. There appears
  little reason for duplicating within the Army an outside organization which by its
  experience is better qualified than we are to carry out some of our tasks. The
  advantages to our nation in economy and to the Army in efficiency are compelling
  reasons for this procedure.</p>

  <p>(4) <em>Within the Army we must separate responsibility for research and development
  from the functions of procurement purchase, storage, and distribution.</em> Our
  experience during the war and the experience of industry in time of peace indicate the
  need for such a policy. The inevitable gap between the scientist or technologist and
  the user can be bridged, as during the last war, by field experimentation with
  equipment still in the developmental stage. For example restricted-visibility
  operations with the aid of radar, such as blind bombing and control of tactical air,
  were made possible largely by bringing together technologists who knew the
  potentialities of the equipment and field commanders familiar with combat conditions
  and needs. Future cooperation of this type requires that research and development
  groups have authority to procure experimental items for similar tests.</p>

  <p>(5) <em>Officers of all arms and services must become fully aware of the advantages
  which the Army can derive from the close integration of civilian talent with military
  plans and developments.</em> This end cannot be achieved merely by sending officers to
  universities for professional training. It is true that the Army's need for officers
  well trained in the natural and social sciences requires a thorough program of advanced
  study for selected military personnel, but in addition we must supply inducements which
  will encourage these men in the continued practical application of scientific and
  technological thought to military problems. A premium must be placed on professional
  attainments in the natural and social sciences as well as other branches of military
  science. Officers in each arm and service must familiarize themselves as much as
  possible with progress and plans made in other branches. Only then can the Army obtain
  the administrative and operative talents essential to its task and mutual understanding
  by the arms and services of their respective problems.</p>

  <p>In general, the more we can achieve the objectives indicated above with respect to
  the cultivation, support and direct use of outside resources, the more energy will we
  have left to devote to strictly military problems for which there are no outside
  facilities or which for special security reasons can only be handled by the military.
  In fact, it is our responsibility deliberately to examine all outside resources as to
  adequacy, diversity, and geographical distribution and to ensure their full utilization
  as factors of security. It is our job to take the initiative to promote the development
  of new resources, if our national security indicates the need. It is our duty to
  support broad research programs in educational institutions, in industry, and in
  whatever field might be of importance to the Army. Close integration of military and
  civilian resources will not only directly benefit the Army, but indirectly contribute
  to the nation's security, as civilians are prepared for their role in an emergency by
  the experience gained in time of peace. The association of military and civilians in
  educational institutions and industry will level barriers, engender mutual
  understanding, and lead to the cultivation of friendships invaluable for future
  cooperation. The realization of our objectives places upon us, the military, the
  challenge to make our professional officers the equals in knowledge and training of
  civilians in similar fields and make our professional environment as inviting as those
  outside.</p>

  <p>In the interest of cultivating to the utmost the integration of civilian and
  military resources and of securing the most effective unified direction of our research
  and development activities, this responsibility is being consolidated in a separate
  section on the highest War Department level. The Director of this section will be
  directly supported by one or more civilians, thus ensuring full confidence of both the
  military and the civilian in this undertaking. By the rotation of civilian specialists
  in this capacity we should have the benefit of broad guidance and should be able to
  furnish science and industry with a firsthand understanding of our problems and
  objectives. By developing the general policies outlined above under the leadership of
  the Director of Research and Development the Army will demonstrate the value it places
  upon science and technology and further the integration of civilian and military
  resources.</p>

  <p>Signed by General Eisenhower<br />
  on April 27, 1946.</p>
