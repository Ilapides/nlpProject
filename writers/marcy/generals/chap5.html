  <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

  <h1>The decline in steel and auto</h1>

  <p>The new economic crisis, which has long been in the making, has emboldened the
  military and weakened certain sectors of society which had hitherto been relied upon
  for resistance to it.</p>

  <p>Among the most recent victims have been the very large universities and institutions
  of learning in the United States.</p>

  <p>Never having been more than mild dissenters, and more often spokespeople for the
  liberal element of the capitalist establishment, bourgeois academia today has become
  cowed under the double pressure of the surge of the new right and the deteriorating
  situation in the availability of funds for research and development.</p>

  <h3>Universities throw out welcome mat to military</h3>

  <p>An article in the May 13, 1980 science section of the New York Times gleefully
  reports how the colleges and universities of the U.S. are throwing the welcome mat out
  for the military in their search for funding. "Major universities that were once the
  seats of the anti-war movement, such as Cornell, MIT, Stanford and the University of
  California at Berkeley, are elbowing one another to get a piece of the $200 million
  that Congress recently authorized the Pentagon to spend."</p>

  <p>This is only one example of what has been taking place for a period of time since
  the late '70s. The Carter administration's new military budget plans to vastly increase
  the Pentagon's spending for scientific research and development.</p>

  <p>Even in the 1979 budget the government appropriated nearly $30 billion for research
  and development. It's no wonder, then, that the <em>Times</em> article referred to
  characterizes the Pentagon's new thrust into the universities as "flush with money and
  with explicit White House encouragement."</p>

  <p>Even before the new capitalist crisis, the military had carried on a quiet war
  against the civilian establishment in competing for scientific and technical as well as
  managerial personnel. Now, with the capitalist crisis becoming deeper, even some of the
  most liberal of the institutions are seeing the Pentagon in a new light.</p>

  <h3>Pentagon draining resources for military research</h3>

  <p>It has generally been acknowledged that the U.S. government spends more than half of
  its research and development money for military purposes. This has had the effect of
  draining away resources and personnel from other avenues of industrial, technological
  and scientific endeavor.</p>

  <p>It should also be noted that much of the so-called non-military spending by the
  government is also really for the military. As Professor Jonathan King, a well-known
  MIT biologist, puts it in the very same <em>Times</em> article, Pentagon-backed
  research fundamentally feeds into military uses.</p>

  <p>"It's basic weapons research rather than applied weapons research. All of this
  'non-military' research is military research in disguise." This has been going on for
  many years. In so doing, however, the Pentagon war machine is cutting the ground from
  under its own feet by undermining the very basic industries which have been responsible
  in the first place for its much-vaunted military prowess.</p>

  <p>Such is the nature of monopoly capitalism which leads society from one blind alley
  into another. This is a result of the relentless search for military solutions when
  economic problems cannot be solved on the basis of capitalist political economy.</p>

  <h3>Effects on West German and Japanese competition</h3>

  <p>The draining of scientific, technical, and managerial personnel from the civilian
  industrial establishment here is at least one factor which accounts for the West German
  and Japanese success in their economic competition with the U.S.</p>

  <p>West Germany and Japan spend relatively little for military research and development
  in comparison with the U.S. This has made it possible for capitalist West Germany and
  Japan to make more resources available for research and development in the civilian
  sector, including steel and auto manufacturing.</p>

  <p>This is one of the factors, among many others, which lies behind the ability of both
  Japan and West Germany to compete in steel as well as in automobiles.</p>

  <h3>Deterioration of U.S. industrial base</h3>

  <p>Professor Melman in his <em>Pentagon Capitalism</em> quotes an authoritative study
  by McGraw-Hill made as long ago as 1968, which disclosed that 64% of the metal-working
  machine tools used in U.S. industry were 10 years old or older.</p>

  <p>"The age of this industrial equipment," he says (referring to drills, lathes, etc.),
  "marks the U.S. machine-tool stock as the oldest among all major industrial nations."
  He says further that it marks a continuation of a deterioration process that began at
  the end of the Second World War. "This deterioration at the base of the industrial
  system certifies to the continuous debilitating and depleting effect that the military
  use of capital and research and development talent has had on American industry."</p>

  <p>Deterioration in the iron and steel industry is particularly significant and is not
  a new phenomenon. For instance, the May 1966 quarterly <em>Journal of Economics</em>
  revealed that the U.S. 1966 quarterly <em>Journal of Economics</em> revealed that the
  U.S. iron and steel industry had not only lagged significantly in research and
  development but has been notable for backwardness in adapting new technology. What was
  true in 1966 is just as true today, even as the steel industry attempts to rationalize
  its equipment.</p>

  <h3>U.S. trends reinforce Japanese lead</h3>

  <p>During the past 20 years, says Professor Melman, these trends have reinforced the
  lead the Japanese manufacturing industry has taken in several areas ranging from
  shipbuilding to civilian electronics. This is equally true of West Germany, although
  the lead that the latter may have in technology at the present time is not necessarily
  in the same areas, such as shipbuilding, etc.</p>

  <p>This technological lead in some of the vital areas resulting from a greater
  concentration on civilian research and development than the U.S. could scarcely be due
  to the peace-loving sentiments of the Japanese or West German ruling class as opposed
  to the U.S. bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>It is to be remembered that both imperialist Japan and West Germany are, by virtue
  of their surrender agreements following the Second World War, prohibited from
  rearming.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that also included in the surrender agreements are provisions
  which, if not clearly and explicitly stated, have nevertheless been binding. These
  include provisions that the U.S. would give world-market access, including U.S.
  markets, but not control to Japanese and West German exports.</p>

  <p>It is precisely the U.S. role of world policeman &mdash; its role as the dominant
  military and diplomatic power in the world &mdash; which operates as a disincentive for the
  further development of scientific innovation and invention as well as for the further
  sophistication of technology in general. Militarism, which initially operates as a
  spur, is therefore ultimately a brake on the overall development of the productive
  forces of society.</p>

  <h3>U.S. postwar aims</h3>

  <p>The U.S. ruling class was most concerned at the end of the Second World War in
  rehabilitating their former adversaries, so as to avoid socialist revolutions in those
  countries, as well as to block even a neutralist attitude by them towards the Soviet
  Union and other socialist countries.</p>

  <p>For a number of years after the Second World War, the U.S. maintained a sort of
  open-door policy with respect to West German, Japanese, and other European capitalist
  countries. This was the period after the Second World War which made a capitalist
  economic recovery inevitable.</p>

  <p>The years which saw the Korean War followed by the Viet Nam War continued the upward
  surge of the capitalist economy, interrupted by several short recessions. The U.S.
  liberal trade policy at the time in relation to its imperialist rivals was not
  motivated by a humanitarian consideration or due to any particular peace-loving
  approach by Washington.</p>

  <h3>Open-door policy based on false assumption</h3>

  <p>It was understood then that the so-called open-door policy would also accelerate
  U.S. exports while the imports from Japan, West Germany and the rest of the European
  capitalist countries would not be formidable. But this turned out to be a false
  assumption.</p>

  <p>While Japan in the very early fifties was producing motor vehicles at about a
  million a year, it now produces 10 million vehicles annually. In steel, Japan has
  superseded the U.S. as the leading producer in the capitalist world.</p>

  <p>Of course, this is not due entirely to the fact that Japanese and West European
  countries (especially West Germany) invest so little, relatively speaking, of their
  research and development funds and personnel in military purposes and invest most of it
  in civilian industrial research and development. But it is a significant factor.</p>

  <p>The latest offensive by the Pentagon against academia is bound to shift much more of
  the technical, engineering and managerial personnel to military purposes, so as to
  widen the gap between military and civilian research and development.</p>

  <p>Building new, more fuel-efficient cars will of course undermine the sharp rise of
  Japanese and West German imports into the U.S. But the ability of these two imperialist
  rivals to still further retaliate is not only conceivable, it is quite probable.</p>

  <h3>Trade war entails perilous consequences for Pentagon</h3>

  <p>What must also be borne in mind is that a trade war between the imperialist rivals
  may entail dangerous political consequences for the Pentagon, which sees itself as the
  policeman of the world. Pushing West Germany and Japan, in particular, too hard runs
  the risk of a possible switch in allegiance from NATO in general and U.S. imperialism
  in particular.</p>

  <p>The reluctance of the European and Japanese allies to go along with the U.S. on Iran
  is directly related to the raging trade war in the imperialist world. For West Germany
  and Japan, neither of whom have oil of their own, to cut themselves off from Iranian
  and all of Mideast oil would tremendously weaken their industrial capacity to compete
  with the U.S., which has vast oil resources at home, and in Canada, and can acquire oil
  in Mexico, Venezuela, Indonesia and other parts of the world, including Nigeria.</p>

  <p>The big hullabaloo in the U.S. capitalist press about "unfair competition" in both
  steel and auto from Japanese and West European capitalism is thus extremely
  hypocritical. It does not present a full picture to the U.S. working class, which needs
  to know why there are hundreds of thousands of workers being laid off in the auto
  industry and why steel plants have been closing for several years now.</p>

  <h3>Crisis is of worldwide character</h3>

  <p>With respect to the steel industry as a whole, it should be noted that the crisis
  there is not really a national phenomenon of the U.S., but has a worldwide character,
  certainly as far as the capitalist world is concerned, The steel industries in Britain,
  in France, in West Germany, and in Belgium are all suffering from the same disease. It
  is called in the bourgeois press "excess capacity" of the steel industry.</p>

  <p>As long ago as September 29, 1977, the <em>New York Times</em> carried a
  comprehensive roundup with the expressive headline, "Crisis deepening in American
  steel." The article showed that it was a worldwide phenomenon.</p>

  <p>Not that there were too many steel mills in the capitalist world, but that the
  capitalist market could not absorb the amount that was being produced in the light of
  an increasing deterioration in the world capitalist economy as a whole. There has been
  so-called idle plant capacity not only in the U.S., but also in Japan, West Germany,
  Britain and Belgium.</p>

  <p>The stagnation in the steel industry, it turns out, was merely the precursor to the
  present capitalist crisis, which the Carter administration finally officially admitted
  only recently.</p>

  <p>When the demand for steel began to shrink, rather than cut prices to meet
  competition, these industrial giants, which are in reality monopolies in their own
  countries, preferred to cut their losses by closing plants and reducing overhead. Where
  possible, they even raised prices or tried to shut out the foreign imports as a medium
  for later jacking up prices.</p>

  <p>The U.S. had at first a so-called liberal policy towards imports in the hope that
  the competition would not be severe. Now that the capitalist crisis is on, the
  competition has greatly intensified.</p>

  <h3>Inflation generated by protectionism</h3>

  <p>The answer of the auto and steel magnates is to shut out the imports, which of
  course will in turn generate more inflation because it will keep out the lower-priced
  foreign imports.</p>

  <p>The capitalist economic crisis of the early 1930s resulted in a wave of
  protectionism (that is, closing the door to imports which, if followed by all the
  capitalist countries, ultimately cancels out the advantages for all save the
  strongest). In the same way, the U.S. steel magnates and some of the auto barons as
  well (not including GM as yet) are presently calling for protection, but this is merely
  a device which cannot solve the crisis in auto or steel.</p>

  <p>It can, however, set them on the road to sharpening imperialist antagonisms.</p>

  <p>Thus it becomes plainer every day that it is competition, which is the very
  lifeblood of capitalism, that sets the imperialist rivals on the same road they trod
  during the early 1930s and which ultimately led them to the Second World War.</p>

  <p>Mindful of the consequences of such a policy, the Carter administration and the
  military-industrial complex are attempting to divert the crisis in the imperialist camp
  into military channels directed against oppressed countries such as those in the Middle
  East and against the USSR and other socialist countries.</p>

  <h3>Carter's meeting with Ohira</h3>

  <p>When Japanese Prime Minister Ohira was in the U.S., one of the matters that
  President Carter took up with him was the raising of the defense capacity of Japan.
  This is another version of the same thing the U.S. has been pushing on Western Europe,
  in particular West Germany, that is, pressuring them to raise their defense
  expenditures.</p>

  <p>This is presumably out of tender concern for the protection of Western Europe and
  Japan from alleged plans of the Soviet Union for aggression against them.</p>

  <p>This does <strong>not</strong> mean urging them to divert funds for technical,
  engineering and scientific personnel into weapons research and development of
  <strong>their own making.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>On the contrary the U.S. version of the so-called defense of Western Europe
  and Japan is to force upon them planes, guns, missiles, and sophisticated weapons systems
  made in the U.S. and sold to the imperialist allies at extortionate
  profits.</strong></p>

  <p>This, in part, answers the question as to why the U.S. military-industrial complex
  is so recklessly diverting funds for military uses, which in a rational society, should
  be devoted for civilian research, development, and reconstruction which the country so
  badly needs. It is this diversion of resources which has caused such widespread decay
  of the principal cities of the United States and which threatens the livelihood of
  millions upon millions of working people of this country.</p>
