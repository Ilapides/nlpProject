  <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

  <h1>Behind Carter's 'rescue' plan</h1>

  <p>On the morning of April 25, 1980, President Carter, in his televised address to the
  nation explaining the so-called rescue operation in Iran, said, "It was my decision to
  attempt the rescue operation; it was my decision to cancel it when problems developed
  in the placement of our rescue team for a future rescue operation. The responsibility
  is fully my own."</p>

  <p>As the reader can see, Carter's assumption of responsibility is modeled after
  President Kennedy who also took full responsibility at the time of the Bay of Pigs
  fiasco.</p>

  <h3>Why the confession?</h3>

  <p>Why was it necessary for President Carter and earlier Kennedy to make these
  apparently wholly gratuitous assumptions of responsibility? Has it not always been
  generally understood that the head of state, be he or she a monarch, a prime minister,
  or a president is in full charge and has the general responsibility in peace and war
  over such developments as the Bay of Pigs or the so-called rescue operation? And has it
  not always been understood that the military's responsibility is to carry out the
  general directives of the President?</p>

  <p>It is rare, if one looks at the historical record, to find precedents for these
  extraordinary self-flagellating assumptions of responsibility made by both Kennedy and
  Carter. Certainly Churchill didn't make one after the Dunkirk disaster.</p>

  <p>The media explain it more or less as a brave and gratuitous admission of a probable
  error or mistake by the President. It is also understood to be a defense mechanism or
  ploy to ward off partisan attacks by Carter's capitalist rivals for the presidency.</p>

  <p>There may be a grain of truth in all this, but it conceals the essence of the matter
  The purpose of the assumption of responsibility by Kennedy as well as by Carter was to
  shield themselves from an increasingly aggressive military and an effort to absolve the
  military from any civilian attack by liberal elements in the capitalist
  establishment.</p>

  <h3>Shields military</h3>

  <p>This is regarded as essential in order to perpetuate the mythology concerning the
  military's non-partisanship and aloofness from the political struggle that is
  constantly wracking the capitalist government. It is to be assumed that the military,
  in both Kennedy's Bay of Pigs fiasco and in Carter's more recent disaster, was merely
  executing orders given to them by the Commander-in-Chief. This, however, is altogether
  untrue. In Kennedy's case, it was the Joint Chiefs of Staff who conceived, originated,
  and pressured Kennedy into accepting the Bay of Pigs operation with an ill-disguised
  CIA cover.</p>

  <p>It would seem this is too well known to be debatable at this late date in history.
  No less than Senator Henry Jackson, a long-time hawk who could scarcely be regarded as
  a foe of the military, said on the early morning CBS news of April 29, 1980, that "the
  Bay of Pigs was the Joint Chiefs of Staff's idea."</p>

  <p>In Carter's case, the media and press have focused the entire responsibility on him,
  notwithstanding his anticipatory defense mechanism in taking full responsibility
  beforehand. Here, too, Carter's self-assumption of responsibility is not done out of
  tender concern for his former colleagues in the military, but out of fear of invoking
  their wrath.</p>

  <h3>Competence not the issue</h3>

  <p>Of the many news stories and analyses that are saturating both the media and press,
  only bare references are made here and there to the role of the military. The April 27
  [1980] <em>Washington Post,</em> in an article by Martin Schram, does, however,
  slightly touch on it: "The most far-reaching of questions should be directed not at the
  President, but at the military establishment that he nominally heads."</p>

  <p>Schram, however, addresses himself not to the military's political role in the
  capitalist establishment but to the competency and skill of the military He says, "The
  professionals of the American military have compiled a modern record replete with
  failure and catastrophe."</p>

  <p>This is true enough, especially if one takes into account the experience of the last
  two decades. It is, however, beside the point. Schram's attack on the military is a
  sorry bourgeois method of defending civilian dominance of the capitalist establishment.
  It does not go to the heart of the matter which is the military's growing tendency to
  expand its political role in the decision-making process of the capitalist
  establishment and to subordinate, if not subvert, the civilian role regarding war and
  peace.</p>

  <p>A great deal is bound to come out regarding the failure of the so-called rescue
  operation, but there are at least two tendencies in the military establishment which
  pressed their respective positions on Carter in dealing with the Iranian situation
  following the taking of the U.S. Embassy personnel last November 4.</p>

  <h3>First tendency in military</h3>

  <p>The first tendency, in our view, is the one which probably appealed to Carter most
  of all. It is a tendency whose view has considerable attraction to elements of the
  military and is probably very widespread under the circumstances of the Iranian
  situation, especially as regards the hostages. It is a tendency which is so pervasive
  that President Eisenhower in his farewell address to the nation on January 17, 1961,
  took special pains to warn against it:</p>

  <p>"Crises there will continue to be. In meeting them, whether foreign or domestic,
  great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and
  costly action could become the miraculous solution to all the current
  difficulties."</p>

  <p>The rescue operation, as presented by the Pentagon grouping in what we would call
  the first tendency is precisely the "recurring temptation" to launch that "spectacular
  and costly action" which could become the miraculous solution to all of Carter's
  current difficulties.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely possible to conceive a plan that is more fitting to the needs of the
  President at this particular moment &mdash; especially if one considers what a tremendous
  diversion it would be from the truly enormous economic problems that are facing the
  millions as a result of the deepening of the economic crisis.</p>

  <p>It should not be thought, however, that the only objective of this first tendency
  was the rescue of the hostages. On the contrary, every military plan of such a nature
  is also a political maneuver to cover the wider and broader issue of the prosecution of
  a war in the Gulf area. The forced resignation of Secretary of State Vance confirms the
  double and apparently ambiguous character of the rescue operation.</p>

  <h3>Second tendency</h3>

  <p>There is a second tendency which is not at all mesmerized by spectacular actions
  aimed at miraculous solutions, above all for the current difficulties of President
  Carter. This tendency in the military is composed of many faceless, silent generals and
  admirals whose entire orientation has long been geared to an overall military struggle
  and who regard the politicians with contempt.</p>

  <p>With many of them the only question is: In which theater should the war be fought or
  commenced? Like the rest of the professionals in the military, they're intensely
  political and their every military plan in reality reflects their overall politics.</p>

  <p>Any plan that they present, whether it be for a rescue operation or something else,
  also carries the imprint of their overall political strategy. Therefore, their input
  into the rescue operation would necessarily be one which would in reality be a
  disguised alternative to the first tendency's plan.</p>

  <p>It should, therefore, not be at all surprising that the rescue plan as presented to
  Carter would be of an ambiguous character, that is, could be interpreted either as a
  genuine rescue operation or as a first step in the launching of a general war against
  the Iranian people, thereby igniting the entire region in a military conflagration.</p>

  <p>The general public would, of course, have no way of knowing this, were it not for
  the complete failure and collapse of the mission.</p>

  <p>So far as Carter himself is concerned, his position or his vacillation from one plan
  to another, whichever it may be, is in reality irrelevant. The fundamental fact to
  emerge from the launching of this military operation is that it constituted a flagrant
  intervention, an undisguised invasion by military force into Iranian territory. It was
  the failure of the mission that made it possible to detect the inner conflict in the
  military for dominance in the White House.</p>

  <h3>Wanted to go further</h3>

  <p>This was made plain when the second tendency trotted out one of a considerable
  number of so-called military intellectuals from the stable of the Pentagon to speak its
  mind, at least in part. This happened on national public television. Channel 13 in New
  York, on April 25, 1980, interviewed Edward Luttwak, who attacked the so-called rescue
  operation on the ground that the original plan "was whittled down by the White House,"
  meaning the first tendency in the military, and was subsequently changed so much that,
  according to Luttwak, more time was spent on how the operation could be cancelled than
  how it could be successful. It was, he said, "like planning for divorce while talking
  about marriage."</p>

  <p>Who is Luttwak? He was a close aide and associate to former Secretary of Defense
  Schlesinger and completely shared Schlesinger's theory on preemptive nuclear war
  against the USSR for which, according to a <em>New York Times</em> editorial of
  November 7, 1975, Schlesinger was ousted. 1975, Schlesinger was ousted.</p>

  <p>Which of the two tendencies has the ascendancy in the White House may change from
  day to day. But that they have set the general course for imperialist war is
  certain.</p>

  <h3>Vance's ouster</h3>

  <p>The proof of this is the elimination of Secretary of State Vance. His elimination
  signifies the dominance of the military faction of the ruling class in the councils of
  the capitalist state's hierarchy. The moderating, more restrained, less adventurous
  section of the ruling class has been on a steady decline for many years. The ouster of
  Vance indicates that it has lost, in effect, a significant role, at least insofar as
  foreign policy is concerned. The tidal wave of fear and even protest that swept the
  world imperialist capitals, not to speak of the capitals of other countries, has forced
  the Carter administration to quickly nominate Edmund Muskie to fill the vacancy created
  by Vance's forced resignation. This is hardly calculated to undo what has already been
  done or even slow down the process of militarization and preparation for war which the
  rescue operation signified.</p>

  <h3>Muskie's role</h3>

  <p>As far as Muskie himself goes, his elevation to the post of Secretary of State,
  should that happen, would merely mean that he has become the public relations counsel
  for the Pentagon. His flabbiness in the struggle against the ultra-right was
  dramatically illustrated at the time he tried to get the nomination for the President
  on the Democratic ticket in 1972. Under minor attack from the ultra-right publisher of
  the New Hampshire <em>Union Leader</em> involving a vicious personal slander against
  him, Muskie wilted. To the astonishment of his supporters, instead of launching a sharp
  political counter-attack, he literally burst out crying.</p>

  <p>Carter's motivation for appointing him, in addition to mollifying domestic and world
  public opinion, was the same as Lyndon Johnson's when he coopted Senator Humphrey to
  run as his Vice President &mdash; get a well-established liberal to sell a reactionary
  war.</p>

  <p>The capitalist press has depicted the struggle that arose as a result of the failure
  of the operation and the forced resignation of Vance as one between the moderate,
  restrained, experienced imperialist professional diplomats and what Leslie Gelb in the
  <em>New York Times</em> of April 29 calls a "street-fighter" Brzezinski. In reality the
  struggle far transcends the rivalries inherent in the two factions as represented by
  these two different personalities.</p>

  <p>The ouster of Vance means that the more moderate, less adventurist, and more
  restrained element of the ruling class has lost its traditional influence in the higher
  councils of the capitalist establishment, at least as far as foreign policy is
  concerned.</p>

  <h3>Brzezinski and the Pentagon</h3>

  <p>Brzezinski himself has no independent class grouping behind him nor any roots in
  one. He owes his rise to the influence of such Rockefeller-controlled instrumentalities
  as the Trilateral Commission, among many others, where his abilities have been put to
  serve their sordid needs.</p>

  <p>It is to be noted that in his capacity as National Security Advisor, his office is
  staffed almost completely with Pentagon personnel. It is a measure of the growing
  strength of the military in the White House. These in turn are representatives of the
  steady and consistent growth of the military-industrial complex and its ascendancy over
  the more moderate elements of the bourgeoisie in general.</p>

  <p>As an independent figure, Brzezinski would have no standing at all. But in his
  capacity as a representative of the military-industrial complex, and more particularly
  the professional militarists at the helm in the Pentagon, he wields considerable power
  and exercises a preponderant influence in shaping foreign policy &mdash; until such time as
  the Pentagon may regard him as surplus baggage.</p>
