<h5>Generals over the White House [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />
  <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

  <h1>The political generals</h1>

  <p>According to the conventional wisdom of that element of the liberal bourgeoisie
  which is steadily retreating before the rightist trend in the capitalist establishment
  it takes a real hardliner, an all-out rightist, to settle a grave international or
  domestic crisis on a progressive basis.</p>

  <p>They give the example of General de Gaulle and cite his settlement of the Algerian
  independence struggle. They also invoke Nixon's opening up of relations with the
  Peoples Republic of China his signing of the first SALT treaty and the various
  agreements with the USSR during the Nixon administration which are cited as the
  beginning of detente.</p>

  <p>It was reckoned by the bourgeois liberals in retreat that in a similar way Carter, a
  former nuclear engineer who also served in the Navy for seven years and has intimate
  connections with the military and conservative Southerners, would be able to put across
  the SALT II treaty and get it ratified by the Senate.</p>

  <h3>Turned around on SALT</h3>

  <p>As of today, President Carter has not only withdrawn the treaty from consideration
  by the Senate, but announced at his last press conference that under some conditions
  (which he didn't name he would even unilaterally without any consideration by the
  Senate renounce the treaty which he had signed. This shocked even his close aides in
  the White House. It constituted a 180-degree turnaround from the days when he at least
  verbally championed the treaty and said that "there will not be a more important piece
  of legislation before the Senate in my lifetime and in this century." It is hardly
  possible to conceive of a more provocative move against the USSR than the unilateral
  renunciation of the treaty The implications were it to happen which is doubtful), would
  almost certainly entail parallel counter-measures by the USSR.</p>

  <p>Aside from the downright cynicism and banality of the liberal element of the
  capitalist establishment and the dubious validity of their strategy of embracing a
  right-winger to prosecute a progressive cause, the examples given of de Gaulle and
  Nixon, when viewed in the totality of their tenure in office, are false. And that of
  Carter is completely bankrupt.</p>

  <p>De Gaulle's role in the settlement of the Algerian crisis is much overrated and that
  of the Algerian revolutionary struggle underestimated So is the solidarity of the
  French working class with the Algerian people.</p>

  <p>Completely forgotten, of course, is de Gaulle's strikebreaking threat to crush the
  historic 1968 general strike using elements of the military known for their fascist
  inclinations.</p>

  <p>Of course the retreating liberals who saw Nixon as a proponent of peace with the
  USSR and China through negotiation, not confrontation," completely overlooked his role
  in Watergate in making the alluring analogy with de Gaulle.</p>

  <h3>Pressure from the military</h3>

  <p>It's not pressure from below, from the people, which accounts for Carter's sharp
  turn to the right. It's not the Afghanistan events, which are being used as a pretext
  and a cover for a new extremely chauvinist and militarist approach by the Carter
  administration. It's not any new-found weaknesses, loopholes, or disadvantages of the
  SALT treaty.</p>

  <p>The pressure comes mostly from the military and it becomes more severe and
  unrelenting with each passing day.</p>

  <p>In last week's article we called attention to the 170 admirals and generals who on
  January 21 1979 in a letter to the President published as an advertisement in leading
  capitalist dailies in the U.S., virtually presented him with an ultimatum. They
  demanded an abandonment of SALT and once again called for U.S. military superiority
  over the USSR and the renouncing of any concept of detente. This, however, only seems
  to be the tip of the iceberg.</p>

  <p>The American Security Council, one of the more prominent fronts for the military,
  claims that 2,530 retired generals and admirals have allegiance to its far-right
  militarist program, which reads about the same as that of the 170 generals and
  admirals. Even if this is an exaggeration, which we believe it to be, the 29
  co-chairmen who have lent their names to this front are certainly significant retired
  military leaders and constitute an ever-growing influence in all aspects of the
  political struggle in the United States.</p>

  <h3>Who's who of the military</h3>

  <p>Some of the co-chairmen of what the American Security Council calls the Coalition
  for Peace Through Strength are: William Middendorf, former Secretary of the Navy;
  Thomas Reed, former Secretary of the Air Force; Adm. Thomas Moorer, U.S. Navy, ret.,
  former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. Lyman Lemnitzer, USA, ret., former
  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Daniel 0 Graham USA ret former director
  Defense Intelligence Agency Maj. Gen. George Keegan, USAF, ret, former chief of U.S.
  Air Force Intelligence; Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub USA ret former chief of staff United
  Nations Command south Korea Gen. Richard E. Stillwell USA, ret.</p>

  <p>Most conspicuous in this list is General Keegan, who was the driving force behind
  the mobilization of the retired military camarilla.</p>

  <p>Conspicuously absent from this list of co-chairmen is former Chief of Naval
  Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, who while allying himself with this group in general
  steers in the direction of an independent faction as does General Westmoreland, former
  U.S. commander in Viet Nam.</p>

  <p>It must be understood that the retired generals and admirals most frequently speak
  for the generals and admirals in the service, or at least a faction of them. A great
  many of the generals and admirals have direct links to the military-industrial complex
  to the arms manufacturers as well as to scientific and technical institutes of the
  universities. Many in retirement draw down fat salaries as consultants to the principal
  defense contractors and find legal subterfuges to conceal their "conflict of interest"
  as cronies of the huge conglomerates, the multi-national corporations which produce a
  multitude of horrendous military weapons systems.</p>

  <p>Following the example of General Douglas MacArthur, who in retirement became
  chairman of Remington-Rand, General Alexander Haig and practically all his predecessors
  in similar offices have done the same. Haig is now working for United Technologies-a
  defense contractor.</p>

  <h3>Adopting program of the right</h3>

  <p>In the continuing open and covert struggle between the military and civilian arms of
  the government the capitalist politicians often try to play the game of stealing the
  thunder from the other side," the way candidates in the bourgeois parties try to
  appropriate each other's program in order to improve their position with the
  electorate. The late Senators Humphrey, Morse, and others, in their effort to beat off
  the rightist attacks during the Joseph McCarthy period often took over the program of
  the right both from the point of view of self-protection and as a tactic of disarming
  the right, especially the extremists in the McCarthy camp.</p>

  <p>In the same way the Carter administration and its predecessor have continually given
  way to the military's demands as a way of warding off their encroachments on the
  administrative and political processes of the capitalist apparatus.</p>

  <p>But this, too, is a defeatist approach. It is a fallacy to believe that the
  militarists are merely concerned with program alone. On the contrary, their inclination
  grows stronger all the time to also lay hands on the capitalist apparatus as a whole,
  always awaiting the proper moment.</p>

  <h3>Military wants to run the state</h3>

  <p>The military's appetite for administering the entire state apparatus is not a
  psychological aberration and does not depend on the existence of this or that strong
  individual leader in the military or on the willfulness of any one of the generals to
  become the man on horseback. The strong orientation toward assuming of civil functions
  by the military grows out of the evolution of the fusion of the military with the
  industrial and banking complex, an evolution which capitalist politicians are not
  equipped to resist.</p>

  <p>The existence of acute social crises, internecine struggles in the bourgeois
  establishment, and growing discontent among the masses feeds the military's itch to
  assume more and more of the civil functions of the capitalist government. This is
  especially true at a time of tremendous revolutionary ferment throughout the world
  among the oppresses peoples and the possibility that, with tremendous economic and
  social hardships for the mass of people at home, they will resist bearing the burden of
  the ruling class's assault on their living standards.</p>

  <h3>Role of military in Watergate</h3>

  <p>While many aspects of the Watergate episode have been subjected to investigation and
  analysis by the bourgeois press and free-lance journalists, the special role played by
  the military during the crisis has received little if any attention.</p>

  <p>When in early May of 1973 Nixon was forced to release Haldeman and Ehrlichman, he
  appointed Gen. Alexander Haig, Jr., as the White House Chief of Staff to take
  Haldeman's place. The significance of this appointment vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the
  struggle between the military and civilian roles of the government was completely lost
  and not even alluded to in the capitalist press. For the military, it was something in
  the nature of a precedent-breaking appointment and a leap forward into the operations
  of the civilian government, since it meant taking over Haldeman's job as domestic
  adviser in addition to running other affairs of the White House. <strong>It put the
  military center-stage in the White House, handling all the levers of real power and in
  fact acting as a substitute for the President.</strong></p>

  <h3>Press didn't attack Haig appointment</h3>

  <p>In making the announcement of Haig's appointment, Nixon was careful to use the term
  "interim," fearful that the press might attack him for putting the military in charge.
  No such attach ever came. In fact, because of the factional division in the ruling
  class, neither side was ready in the slightest degree to attack the military aspect of
  this appointment.</p>

  <p>It also offered an opportunity to the military to assume its classical role seen
  elsewhere in the capitalist world of intervening as arbitrator or moderator at a time
  when the ruling class is divided by sharp internecine struggles or when a social crisis
  between antagonistic classes assumes threatening proportions.</p>

  <p>It is to be remembered that Nixon had earlier appointed Haig as Army Vice-Chief of
  Staff, skipping over 240 other generals. This unusual appointment could only have been
  arrived at not as an arbitrary choice by Nixon personally, but as a consensus by the
  military chiefs.</p>

  <h3>Haig's rise in the hierarchy</h3>

  <p>Haig's rapid rise in the military hierarchy wasn't based on any military
  achievements but on the fact that he was recognized to be a political general one who
  aligned himself with the hard-line faction of the ruling class in the prosecution of
  the Viet Nam war and with the geopolitical militarist conceptions shared by
  then-Secretary of Defense and warhawk James Schlesinger and Rockefeller-protege
  Secretary of State Kissinger Nixon was relying on Haig to help him out of the crisis
  and shift the political pendulum in his direction.</p>

  <p>But it is noteworthy that when Nixon, reacting to the refusal of Archibald Cox to
  obey his orders, dismissed him as special Watergate prosecutor abolished his office
  accepted the resignation of Attorney General Elliot Richardson and discharged Deputy
  Attorney General William D Ruckelshaus, Haig aside from an alleged threatening remark
  to Ruckelshaus took a hands-off position This was a real blow to Nixon. Practically the
  entire capitalist press was characterizing the crisis as leading to impeachment because
  of the grave constitutional confrontation that was developing between Nixon and the
  court, which had ordered Nixon to give up the Watergate tapes. With both the
  legislative and judicial branches solidly arrayed against him, the only thing that
  could possibly have saved Nixon at that time was a threat by the military through
  General Haig. This never materialized. The military played it cool between the warring
  factions with a view to strengthening its own independent position. After all, they had
  someone in the White House running things their way.</p>

  <h3>No precedent</h3>

  <p>Apologists for the civilian champions of the capitalist government cite that the
  appointment of Haig was not without precedent in recent American history and point out
  that Eisenhower had appointed Major General Wilton B. Persons, as special assistant to
  replace Sherman Adams, who had been forced to resign for accepting a bribe from the
  Boston textile financier Goldfine.</p>

  <p>But the analogy is not at all applicable. Persons was merely an administrative aide
  to a general who was President, while Haig took over domestic political functions and
  practically ran the government during a major political crisis as a substitute for the
  President. Of all the investigations that have taken place since Watergate, none has
  said anything about Haig and Haig himself has kept discreetly quiet to this very day.
  The true role of the military in the crisis has yet to be investigated.</p>

  <h3>Ford pulled back</h3>

  <p>As we noted earlier, when President Carter took over he was in the best possible
  position to push back the military and the inroads it had made into the fabric of the
  contemporary political structure of the U.S. The Ford administration had itself
  realized that as a result of the defeat of the U.S. at the hands of the Vietnamese
  revolutionary struggle as well as the unemployment and growing inflation in the country
  it would be in a very poor position to face a Democratic challenger in the forthcoming
  national elections. Nor would it help to be saddled with General Haig in the White
  House and Schlesinger as secretary of defense especially if Pentagon defense
  expenditures were raised prematurely.</p>

  <p>It did not serve the military's purposes to retain Haig in the White House under
  conditions where the political pendulum was swinging against the Ford administration as
  heir to the discredited Nixon presidency. The military carefully withdrew Haig and had
  him shunted off as commander-in-chief of NATO, getting him out of the limelight when
  conditions militated against the administration. This also suited Ford.</p>

  <h3>Ford's firing of Schlesinger</h3>

  <p>The equally significant change made during the Ford administration was to get rid of
  Schlesinger Unemployment and cutbacks, plus inflation which had only slightly receded,
  had led to economic unrest by large masses of workers. Schlesinger continued to press
  for increased defense appropriations precisely at a time when the Ford administration
  sought less emphasis with a view toward the 1976 election. Both Schlesinger and Haig
  were known for their extreme views with respect to the military, were generally opposed
  to SALT and detente, and were for military superiority over the USSR.</p>

  <p>When Carter took over, he had the option of bringing in an entirely new slate to the
  government, one more removed from the military. As we indicated earlier, however, one
  of the first real tests of his attitude and relationship to the encroachment of the
  military came with his appointment of Admiral Turner to the CIA.</p>

  <p>Two others were equally significant They were his appointment of Schlesinger as
  secretary of energy and his retaining of Haig in the NATO post.</p>

  <h3>Carter, Schlesinger, and Haig</h3>

  <p>When Schlesinger was forced to resign as secretary of defense from the Ford
  administration he was already greatly discredited as a super-hawk A revealing editorial
  in the November 7, 1975 New York Times characterized the rivalry between Kissinger 1975
  New York Times characterized the rivalry between Kissinger and Schlesinger in the
  following alarming admission. Mr. Schlesinger, said the Times, "believed that this
  country needed the option of actually fighting a limited nuclear war" (emphasis S.M.).
  Kissinger, on the other hand, the <em>Times</em> said, harbored growing doubts that
  limited war could be a viable option.</p>

  <p>One would think that this startling revelation, unchallenged by Schlesinger, would
  be enough for Carter to keep him at arm's length. On the contrary, Schlesinger was
  awarded with a cabinet post by Carter which was partly a cover for his military
  intrigues with the Pentagon.</p>

  <p>He was only relieved of his post as energy secretary because the oil monopolies
  didn't take him into their confidence and let him in on their plans for the phony gas
  crisis of 1978. This effectively ended his official participation in the top echelons
  of the capitalist government and forced him to retreat into the shadows, where he
  unquestionably is operating on behalf of the unbridled militarists.</p>

  <p>Nor did Carter try to change the status of the Republican-appointed NATO commander
  General Haig. Haig was constantly leaking his opinions on SALT the neutron bomb and
  other issues as well as bulldozing his NATO allies and even publicly irritating them by
  scolding them for not rapidly enough aligning their positions with his.</p>

  <p>Thus with Admiral Turner in the CIA, General Haig in NATO, Schlesinger acting as
  decoy for the Pentagon under cover of secretary of energy, and Brzezinski as national
  security advisor fully staffed with Pentagon aides Carter as the standard bearer of the
  Democratic Party had from an ideological, military point of view in effect appointed
  four rightwing Republicans to key posts in the Democratic administration The
  personalities may change but the military's role in expanding and strengthening their
  increasingly enormous role in the capitalist state as a whole goes on unabated.</p>
