  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: How imperialism broke up Yugoslav Socialist
  Federation (June 11, 1992)</title>

  <h1>How imperialism broke up Yugoslav Socialist Federation</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (June 11, 1992)</h5>

  <p>It is impossible to seriously consider the Yugoslav situation without first taking
  into account some pertinent aspects of history and politics.</p>

  <p>The imperialist conspiracy to break up the Socialist Federation of Yugoslavia didn't
  start yesterday. It didn't start with the UN Security Council voting for sanctions. It
  didn't start with the earlier meeting of the European Economic Community in Spain.</p>

  <p>It started a long time ago, when the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of
  Yugoslavia (AVNOJ), led by Tito (Josip Broz) and the Communist Party, defeated the
  royalist, reactionary and pro-fascist forces of Col. Draza Mihajlovic and his
  Chetniks.</p>

  <p>The front mobilized the workers, peasants, progressive intellectuals and thousands
  of middle class people in the Partisan guerrilla army that defeated the German Nazi and
  Italian fascist invaders and their quisling regimes.</p>

  <p>The U.S. and the British until 1943 recognized Mihajlovic and his Nazi-sympathizing
  coalition and refused recognition to the representatives of the Yugoslav people
  organized in the AVNOJ.</p>

  <p>Then, seeing that the progressive and revolutionary forces were on the verge of
  scoring a historic victory, the imperialists suddenly changed sides and began to give
  token support to the Partisans. They did so largely to disrupt the socialist solidarity
  between the Yugoslav leaders and the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>The very same forces which fought in Yugoslavia against the revolution, particularly
  the royalist riff-raff and pro-fascist groupings, have all these years been promoted,
  secured, cultivated and supported financially by the U.S. and European imperialists.
  Now they are being pushed forward as an authentic leadership to replace the Yugoslav
  government in Belgrade.</p>

  <h4>Monarchist democrats?</h4>

  <p>In recent days, the imperialist press have written about a "democratic opposition"
  in Serbia. Who are they?</p>

  <p>There is "the Democratic Movement of Serbia, which embraces the old monarchy and
  enjoys the support of many Serbian traditionalists." (Washington Post, May 31)</p>

  <p>What are these monarchist traditions? Suppression of the Serbian people! These idle
  rich have for decades been living it up in the decadent casinos and watering places of
  Europe.</p>

  <p>The Post continued: "Crown Prince Alexander &mdash; the son of the last king of
  Yugoslavia who was forced into exile during World War II &mdash; met recently in
  Washington with senior White House and State Department officials. This week he
  expressed his willingness to preside over a constitutional monarchy in cooperation with
  the democratic movement and spoke of a coalition government that would fall into the
  mainstream of European democracy. It seems likely that the opposition will win the
  backing of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which reportedly has dispatched senior clerics
  to meet with the prince."</p>

  <p>This stooge, who is ordered around by U.S. imperialism like an errand boy, has
  expressed his willingness to head up a "democratic government." And giving him their
  blessing are the reactionary clergy that supported the Mihajlovic forces. This
  "Democratic Movement of Serbia" is nothing but the old reactionaries in a new form.</p>

  <p>They are now boycotting the elections in Serbia because they haven't got the forces
  to contest them. The sanctions against Serbia just passed by the UN Security Council
  (the same council that okayed sanctions and then outright imperialist war against Iraq)
  are timed to coincide with and disrupt the elections.</p>

  <p>An editorial headed "Popular Opposition" (!) in the Financial Times of London (June
  2) calls for the isolation of Serbia: "The demonstration inside Belgrade by some 50,000
  anti-war protesters was an indication that popular opposition to [Serbian leader
  Slobodan Milosevic's] policies is growing, at least in the capital. However, the peace
  movement in Serbia is mainly middle-class based." In other words, it's a bourgeois,
  pro-capitalist, pro-imperialist opposition. The demonstrations seem to be precisely
  timed to undermine the government of Milosevic.</p>

  <p>"It would be an illusion to believe," concedes the London big business paper, "that
  it finds much of an echo in the rural Serb and Montenegrin population, not least the
  Serbs in Bosnia who look on the Belgrade government as their main protector and
  champion."</p>

  <p>A valuable admission from the mouth of the enemy.</p>

  <p>What's missing here is any word on the attitude of the workers. Notwithstanding the
  political confusion caused by the maneuvers of the principal imperialist powers
  involved in the current struggle, the workers of these areas support the Yugoslav
  government.</p>

  <p>Most deeply involved among the European imperialist powers are the Germans and
  Austrians and, to a lesser extent, France and Italy. That's who dominated the European
  Community conference on the Balkans held recently in Spain.</p>

  <p>The U.S. at first feigned disinterest in this struggle.</p>

  <p>Back on March 31, 1991, according to the <em>1992 Encyclopedia Britannica
  Yearbook,</em> "U.S. President George Bush wrote to Ante Markovic, the [Yugoslav]
  federal premier, expressing his support for a united Yugoslavia and warning that those
  who seceded unilaterally would not be rewarded by the U.S., a warning clearly directed
  against Croatia and Slovenia."</p>

  <p>However, "On June 25, first Croatia and then Slovenia proclaimed its independence.
  Two days later, the [Yugoslav army] attacked Slovene border posts that had been taken
  over by the Slovene Territorial Army and customs officials. Fighting extended to other
  parts of Slovenia. ..."</p>

  <p>The Financial Times of London told how Germany then "set off a campaign to recognize
  Croatian independence." (Sept. 9, 1991)</p>

  <p>The U.S. seemed to be outmaneuvered and to have lost interest in this struggle, in
  which Germany was the principal actor through the medium of the European Community.</p>

  <p>However, the apparent ambiguity of the U.S. was ended when in September Cyrus Vance,
  U.S. Secretary of State under President Jimmy Carter, was appointed special UN envoy to
  Yugoslavia. Now Washington was fully in it.</p>

  <p>Germany made it clear it would recognize Slovenia and Croatia. By Dec. 23,
  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia indicated they too were moving toward secession.</p>

  <h4>Imperialism and self-determination</h4>

  <p>What is the Leninist point of view in a case like this? Is the secession of these
  republics from Yugoslavia an example of self-determination?</p>

  <p>Each and every nation has a right to determine its destiny. This can mean
  integration; it can mean joining in a federation; it can also mean exercising the right
  to leave, to secession. In any case it has to express the will of the nation or
  nationality.</p>

  <p>But when the choice is the product of external imperialist pressures of an economic,
  political and even military character, that is another matter.</p>

  <p>Was the president of Croatia defending genuine self-determination when he openly
  called for the U.S. Sixth Fleet to come to Dubrovnik? (CNN Prime News, May 29; the
  president spoke in English.)</p>

  <p>The strategy of the imperialists has been to lure the republics away from the
  Yugoslav federation.</p>

  <p>But they are not united. There is a struggle between Germany and the U.S. over who
  will get the dominant position in the entire Balkan area. Each has its own forum.
  Germany has used the European Community as its instrument. The U.S. is using the United
  Nations.</p>

  <p>Germany and the U.S. are both seeking to make pawns of the republics. The U.S. may
  at one time support the Yugoslav Federal Republic and later come out against it;
  Germany may support Croatia and Slovenia at one point and later change. It all depends
  strictly on the military and political exigencies of the situation. But each is
  attempting to win overall control for itself.</p>

  <h4>Rich vs. poor republics</h4>

  <p>As in so many other areas of the world, there is a more developed so-called northern
  part of Yugoslavia where the bourgeoisie is stronger, and a southern, poorer part.
  Slovenia and Croatia are more developed, whereas Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and
  Montenegro, as well as the province of Kosovo in Serbia, are less developed.</p>

  <p>As of 1975, Croatia was the most industrialized and prosperous. Said the <em>New
  Columbia Encyclopedia</em> of that year: "More than one-third of Croatia is forested
  and lumber is a major export. The region is the leading coal producer of Yugoslavia and
  also has deposits of bauxite, copper, petroleum and iron ore. The republic is the most
  industrialized and prosperous area of Yugoslavia."</p>

  <p>Since then, Slovenia has overtaken Croatia as the most developed.</p>

  <p>Henry Kamm wrote in the New York Times on July 13, 1987, about the rich-poor split
  in Yugoslavia. "The southern republics &mdash; Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia,
  Montenegro as well as the province of Kosovo &mdash; are subsidized by the more
  prosperous areas through a federal fund and direct contributions. ... Slovenia [is
  aware] that its 2 million people have the highest level of economic development among
  the republics and provinces that make up the federal country of 23 million. Slovenia is
  a small Slavic republic. The economic crisis has sharpened the contrast between the
  rich and the poor."</p>

  <p>Kamm interviewed people in Slovenia who resented the southern republics. Milos Kobe
  said, "Fantastic sums go to the south and they don't know how to use them
  economically." A man named Kmecl told the U.S. reporter, "We cannot invest in renewal
  because our capital is going for the development of the underdeveloped. A small country
  like this cannot afford this. After 40 years of this policy, [the southern republics]
  are still not developed and we can't maintain the pace. We're immobilized. A
  technologically highly developed society like Slovenia needs always more for its own
  science and culture while the underdeveloped need more for social protection than they
  produce."</p>

  <p>We have heard this refrain before. It sounds just like the rich bourgeois elements
  in any capitalist country who complain that they have to subsidize the poor. They
  forget that their riches come from the sweat and blood of the workers in every one of
  these republics and that they became industrialized only because of the socialization
  of the means of production and centralized planning. This is what protected them from
  the ravages of imperialist penetration. The federation was like a security blanket that
  helped them develop.</p>

  <p>The imperialists have lured the bourgeois elements of Slovenia and Croatia in
  particular with the promise of becoming an integral part of the European Community and
  sharing in its alleged prosperity. They think they'll get a market for their products
  and be able to deal with the West Europeans on an equal basis, without being
  "encumbered" by the poorer republics in the federation. All of them, including Serbia,
  are being lured to invest their foreign exchange in Europe or America and thereby
  become (they hope) a prosperous part of the imperialist system.</p>

  <p>An article in the New York Times last July 10 shows how the imperialists have
  already succeeded in getting the Yugoslavs to invest large sums in the West. "The
  central bank of Yugoslavia won an important battle in a lawsuit against Drexel,
  Burnham, Lambert and some of its top executives," said the Times. The Yugoslav bank
  "contended it had been tricked by Drexel into providing $70 million that had been used
  in a failed effort to shore up the failed firm."</p>

  <p>The Europeans' strategy is to promise the bourgeois elements all sorts of things
  once they are part of the European Community. And while Washington wants to win these
  republics over to itself, it would still prefer that they be with the Europeans than
  that they remain in a Yugoslavia with the potential for reconstituting a socialist
  federation.</p>

  <p>The Financial Times of London (June 2) editorialized to its fellow imperialists on
  the Continent: "[W]hatever action is finally decided, it is essential that it should be
  taken by the international community as a whole, including the U.S., which alone has
  the clout to bring the transgressors of international law to heel. Anything less, as
  has been proved conclusively, is doomed to failure."</p>

  <p>In other words, Wall Street is the boss and you'd better include them in any move
  against Yugoslavia.</p>

  <h4>Socialist federation a great breakthrough</h4>

  <p>It is impossible to understand the situation in Yugoslavia if we accept the
  imperialist premise that what has happened is merely the surfacing of national
  antagonisms that had been smothered or driven underground following the Yugoslav
  Revolution.</p>

  <p>The establishment of the socialist federation of Yugoslavia was a historic victory.
  For the first time, a united front of the Balkan countries was formed that was able to
  detach them from imperialist domination, either Allied or Axis. It was the product of a
  revolutionary upsurge that engulfed the working class movements of Europe.</p>

  <p>The federation developed over a period of years. Its collective presidency was a
  progressive new political conception. Each republic had an opportunity to run the
  federation for a specified time and in rotation. The same concept prevailed in the
  structure of the Communist parties. They were also organized on the basis of the
  collective principle that the party in each republic had an opportunity to run the
  federated Communist party.</p>

  <p>What opened the gates to imperialism? Unquestionably, a contributing factor was the
  unfortunate and ill-considered split between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.
  Yugoslavia was expelled from the Cominform in 1948 and thereafter isolated from the
  socialist camp. Years later an attempt was made by the USSR leadership to repair the
  situation so Yugoslavia could exist without leaning on or getting aid from imperialism.
  But the socialized, centralized economy of Yugoslavia had already been damaged.</p>

  <p>The gates to imperialism opened wide when Yugoslavia established its so-called
  workers' control of management. This sounded highly democratic &mdash; a step away from
  the rigid, centralized control that stifled the creative energy of the working class.
  Now the workers' talents and abilities to manage Yugoslavia's affairs would be
  utilized.</p>

  <p>Workers' control as a step away from capitalism is progressive. But it's a backward
  step when it leads away from centralized socialist planning. The concept of workers'
  control soon degenerated into managerial control and the abandonment of centralized
  planning. Yugoslavia fell into the coils of the International Monetary Fund and the
  World Bank. By 1981, it was completely dominated by world finance capital. It had
  opened wide the gates to so-called free enterprise.</p>

  <h4>Decentralization, then dismemberment</h4>

  <p>This intensified competition among the various enterprises in each republic and
  among the republics themselves in a thoroughly bourgeois manner. Under such conditions,
  socialist solidarity was lost and more significantly the standard of living plummeted
  to such an extent that workers were no longer able to purchase basic necessities.</p>

  <p>By 1991, the new government had acquired a debt of $31 billion. Unemployment was
  over a million and inflation was 200 percent.</p>

  <p>From free enterprise, the necessity arose for free, sovereign, independent
  republics. Economic decentralization soon led to political decentralization. The
  dismemberment of Yugoslavia had already begun.</p>

  <p>This was not an automatic, spontaneous development. No sooner had there developed
  the greater autonomy of the republics than the imperialists began to funnel funds into
  the republics with a view to encouraging and promoting separatist and secessionist
  objectives. It is they who unloosed the forces of virulent national hatred.</p>

  <p>The stimulation of national hatred is a byproduct of imperialist finance capital's
  investment in Yugoslavia.</p>

  <p>Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, is also a product of that tendency. From the
  earliest days of his ascendancy to CP leadership, the imperialist press played him up
  as a "charismatic personality." They supported his nationalist demagogy. It was only
  later that they found it might become disadvantageous to them if he went too far.</p>

  <p>It must be taken into account that there was no unified policy of the imperialists
  in Yugoslavia. Germany, Italy, France and the U.S. had divergent views on how to
  approach the situation. Each had its own sordid material interests, which often are
  hidden. Their policies can also be mistaken. It is not an easy task to stimulate,
  promote and finance nationalist tendencies in the republics and then get them to carry
  out the wishes of individual imperialist countries without arousing all sorts of
  internecine struggles.</p>

  <p>The very forces that they stimulated and brought into motion got out of control.</p>

  <p>Each imperialist power, even if it has no direct economic interest in Yugoslavia, is
  inevitably drawn into the struggle so as not to be left out of the picture. Each tries
  to find a basis for a relationship with Yugoslavia that will bring it advantage.</p>

  <p>It is no wonder that the U.S. State Department did not always know what to do. But
  one thing they were expert at: financing the counterrevolution.</p>

  <p>It is true that earlier they had tangentially supported the Yugoslav regime. They
  felt a so-called nonaligned entity was useful in the struggle against the USSR. But
  after Tito died there was no basis for tolerating any remaining communist experiments.
  Then the dismantling began in earnest &mdash; not overtly, but covertly.</p>

  <p>Secret diplomacy is one of the most important weapons of imperialism. But the
  different imperialists often find themselves at loggerheads. While each of the
  imperialists would want to outdo the others in exerting influence over a dominant
  Serbia, they are not in favor of a Milosevic who postures as an extreme nationalist and
  who occasionally flouts European and U.S. intervention.</p>

  <h4>Role of Milosevic</h4>

  <p>Milosevic is not very different from any bourgeois nationalist in the oppressed
  countries. Certainly we are opposed to the ideology of a Bonapartist, especially if he
  has degenerated with the abandonment of communism. But that's no excuse for supporting
  imperialist intervention.</p>

  <p>Really, Milosevic is not much different from Saddam Hussein. His espousal of
  bourgeois nationalism is no reason for us to fall on all fours and allow U.S.
  imperialism to run roughshod over the country.</p>

  <p>It reduces itself again to the U.S., Britain and France, notwithstanding their
  differences, attempting to do what they did in Grenada, Panama, Iraq, Nicaragua and
  elsewhere. The fact that it is taking place in Europe does not change the situation at
  all.</p>

  <p>It is not impossible that Serbia or a coalition of some of the republics will
  reunify on the basis of socialist conceptions. In any event, a federation, even on a
  bourgeois basis, is bound to be more progressive and productive, more independent of
  imperialism than if they are cut up into small principalities with no real power in the
  world community.</p>

  <p>We in this country tend to think of the oppressed nations as mainly those in the
  less developed world &mdash; Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and most of Asia.
  Of course, the bourgeoisie will turn heaven and earth to deny that there is national
  oppression in the U.S. From kindergarten on, they drum it into the heads of everyone
  that this is "one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."</p>

  <p>But not well publicized is the fact that national oppression exists also in
  Europe.</p>

  <p>Just saying that one nationality in the Balkans is more developed industrially than
  another blurs the relationship of oppressor to oppressed. For instance, Slovenia may be
  more developed with a higher standard of living, but once it is involved in an
  internecine war and becomes completely dependent on imperialism, it may well find
  itself in a position of subordination and potentially of oppression.</p>

  <p>The tendency in the capitalist press is to obliterate the relationship between
  oppressor and oppressed and present the internecine struggle as a purely Balkan affair
  between the nationalities. Overlooked entirely is that for a period of time there
  existed a federation that not only increased the standard of living but was able on its
  own to play a more or less important role, even on the international arena.</p>

  <p>Under present conditions, particularly if the war continues, all the nationalities
  risk being reduced to pawns of the imperialist powers. It may be true that the Yugoslav
  regime can hold out for a considerable period against imperialist sanctions, but even
  should it come out victorious it will have been drained of much of its life blood and
  material resources, assuming it is able to overcome overt and covert imperialist
  domination.</p>

  <p>Bourgeois radicals tend to neglect the class essence of the struggle in Yugoslavia.
  No matter how carefully they may try to analyze the relations among the nationalities,
  if they leave out the relation between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, between the
  national bourgeoisie and the imperialist banks and industrialists, they are left
  completely at the mercy of monopoly capitalism.</p>

  <h4>Proletariat is leaderless</h4>

  <p>Of course, the most important aspect of the situation in Yugoslavia is the position
  of the proletariat itself. The proletariat at the present time is leaderless, the
  Communist Party having abandoned its vanguard role as leader in the struggle for
  socialist construction.</p>

  <p>Only the proletariat can play a consistent internationalist role. The bourgeoisie,
  on the other hand, by virtue of its overriding interest in overturning socialist and
  state property and promoting private property, not only sharpens its class relations
  with the proletariat but promotes and stimulates antagonisms between the
  nationalities.</p>

  <p>No nation in modern times is free from class rule. Every state rules in the
  interests of either the workers or the bourgeoisie. The mere fact it is small or
  exploited by an imperialist power may obscure that fact but does not invalidate it.
  This must be borne in mind in approaching the national question. One can easily get
  lost in the struggle for nationality, for freedom from oppression, and forget the
  existence of an exploiting class within the nation.</p>

  <p>In the epoch of the bourgeoisie, a nation is merely an instrument of domination by
  the propertied and exploiting class. Of course, the struggle against the imperialist
  oppressor must be led by a proletarian vanguard to be effective and the duty of the
  vanguard is to mobilize all the progressive elements in society on a democratic and
  anti-imperialist basis. An excellent example of this was the Yugoslav struggle for
  liberation.</p>

  <p>The current Yugoslav regime is in large measure a product of the events in the
  Soviet Union, beginning with the Gorbachev administration. His reactionary program
  accelerated all the social antagonisms in Yugoslavia as elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
  Certainly the sweeping bourgeois restorationist measures taken by the new regimes in
  the East and particularly the swallowing up of the German Democratic Republic could not
  but have a detrimental effect on class and socialist consciousness in Yugoslavia.</p>

  <p>The leadership, such as it was, panicked under the impact of these events. They not
  only changed the name of the party, they began to compete with each other over who
  would go further in bourgeois economic reforms.</p>

  <p>The monolithic imperialist press have never had such a clear field to lie and
  deceive the masses, now that they are no longer restrained by the existence of a
  socialist camp. The absence of a strong and vigorous working class press also
  facilitates the task of the bourgeoisie. They are riding high.</p>

  <p>But then comes one of those elemental and spontaneous risings, as in Los Angeles,
  which demonstrate the fragility of bourgeois rule over the working class and the
  oppressed masses.</p>

  <p>Truth crushed to earth will rise again, and with it so will the working class.</p>
