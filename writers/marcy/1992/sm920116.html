  <h1>Class rule and the forms of property</h1>

  <h2>The nature of the new Commonwealth</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Jan. 16, 1992)</h5>

  <p>Even before Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary of the Communist Party of the
  Soviet Union, he made a visit to Britain where he met Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
  This visit could easily have been misunderstood as an isolated initiative, separate and
  apart from the historical perspective of the Soviet government in relation to British
  foreign and domestic policy.</p>

  <p>But Gorbachev's visit capped an effort by the Soviet leadership over more than 70
  years to develop some sort of relationship with the leaders of the British government.
  It was an effort to detach Britain first from European imperialist influence and, as
  time went on, from the U.S.</p>

  <p>From the point of view of Britain's domestic affairs, the role and influence of the
  Labor Party and its trade unions intrigued the Soviet leadership. This was most evident
  in 1945, when the British Labor Party won its historic election victory over Churchill
  and the Conservatives, ushering in a new government headed by Labor Prime Minister
  Clement Atlee.</p>

  <p>But as early as 1926 the Soviet government had attempted to develop some form of
  collaboration with the British trade unions and the Labor Party leadership through
  forming the Anglo-Russian Committee. That effort collapsed, however, with the great
  British general strike. The collaboration between the Soviet leadership and the
  conservative leadership of the British trade unions actually undermined the
  revolutionary militancy of the great general strike.</p>

  <h4>Wartime collaboration with Allies</h4>

  <p>During the years of World War II, the Soviet leadership attempted in every way to
  collaborate with all its Western democratic imperialist allies, seeking out labor and
  liberal leaders wherever possible.</p>

  <p>During the war the Communist parties led the anti-fascist resistance in France and
  Italy. They entered the post-war period armed and with great influence. It will be
  debated for a long, long time whether Stalin held them back from taking power or on
  their own they were unwilling or unable to make the kind of daring revolutionary
  assault on capitalism that would have toppled the bourgeoisie, as in China and
  Cuba.</p>

  <p>The moderates in the Soviet Party leadership &mdash; yes, there were moderates under
  Stalin &mdash; viewed the French Communist Party in particular with wariness. This was
  distinguished from their attitude toward the more moderate bourgeois liberal allies,
  like the British Labor Party leaders and others.</p>

  <p>The Cold War started in earnest in 1947 with the publication of a notorious article
  in the pages of Foreign Affairs magazine signed only "X." The author of this article,
  which sounded the tocsin not merely for the Cold War but for U.S. military aggression,
  was George Kennan, who became U.S. Ambassador to the USSR in 1952.</p>

  <p>The Soviet Union was invited to submit an article for the same issue. However, the
  article by E. Varga, the Soviet Union's chief economist, did not respond to the Kennan
  piece point by point. Instead, it was devoted exclusively to an appeal to Britain to
  break its alliance with the U.S., arguing that it was in Britain's own interest to line
  up with the forces of "peace and democracy."</p>

  <h4>Labor Party nationalizations</h4>

  <p>The British Labor Party government radiated a progressive aura with the dismantling
  of the British Empire. India got its independence, followed by Burma, Ceylon, Palestine
  and others. All of this added to the Labor Party's prestige and generated enormous
  interest on the part of progressives throughout the world. However, little has been
  written about the deep interest it elicited from the Soviet leadership.</p>

  <p>Theoreticians and practical politicians in the leadership of the Soviet Union were
  particularly intrigued by the nationalizations, especially in steel, which took place
  in 1946. First the Labor Party nationalized the Bank of England, then the railroads,
  public utilities and heavy industry.</p>

  <p>This must have evoked discussion among the Soviet leaders on what it all meant in
  terms of the Marxist concept of the struggle for power. Had the bourgeoisie been
  dislodged and expropriated of their properties &mdash; if not in law, at least de
  facto? Would these nationalizations last? Could socialism come peacefully?</p>

  <p>Above all, it was necessary to forge some strong bonds with the Labor Party after
  the wartime collaboration with the Churchill regime.</p>

  <p>During the war years, as a result of the collaboration with the imperialist allies,
  the theoretical level in the Soviet leadership and intelligentsia had considerably
  deteriorated. The ideological position of the political leaders and the intelligentsia,
  as seen in the arts and literature, began to have a distinctly pro-Western
  orientation.</p>

  <p>This trend came to an abrupt halt in 1947 after a book entitled "A History of
  Western Thought" appeared. A review by none other than Andre Zdanov, a Politburo member
  regarded as second only to Stalin at the time, attacked the book in no uncertain terms
  as anti- Marxist and an ideological distortion favorable to the imperialist
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>The review ushered in a new leftist trend in the Soviet Union in response to the
  ideological and political offensive unleashed by the Truman administration. The Cold
  War was on.</p>

  <p>This made it all the more necessary to try and reach some modus vivendi with the
  British leaders. The aim was to undermine the solid front U.S. imperialism was shaping
  through the Marshall Plan to reinforce the containment and military intimidation of the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>The British Labor Party leadership, however, became increasingly hostile to the
  USSR, obediently following the U.S. The Truman administration was picking up the tab
  for Britain's "responsibility" in Greece and Turkey (and has kept it to this day).</p>

  <p>After Stalin's death in 1953, there was a period of collective leadership in the
  USSR. A troika of General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev and Politburo members Nikolai
  Bulganin and Georgi Malenkov made a visit to Britain. They were very interested in
  Britain, not only its foreign policy but also the domestic situation.</p>

  <p>They were rudely treated by the British capitalist press. The visit itself, at least
  on the surface, seemed to amount to little more than a futile gesture.</p>

  <p>All this has to be seen in the historical perspective of the 70-year attempt to
  forge some kind of relationship with the British leadership, whether Conservative or
  Labor. It was meant, of course, to undermine U.S. imperialist predominance and at the
  same time win domestic allies. But it was also an effort to evaluate the British
  experience with nationalizations more carefully.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev's meeting with Thatcher</h4>

  <p>Now let us return to Gorbachev's visit with Thatcher &mdash; a hard-line,
  reactionary, anti-labor leader of the bourgeoisie from the Conservative Party. What
  interested Gorbachev was her apparent success in restructuring British capitalism
  &mdash; especially her successful effort to restore private ownership of the industries
  that had been nationalized by the Labor Party.</p>

  <p>This move to denationalize had met with little revolutionary resistance from the
  British working class, headed by a spineless Labor Party leadership.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev's trip must be viewed in a different light from the earlier visit by
  Khrushchev, Malenkov and Bulganin. While Gorbachev might have been motivated by a
  desire to convey a conciliatory message to the U.S., the more important aspect of his
  meeting with Thatcher was to evaluate the significance of the denationalizations. How
  was it possible to denationalize the industries? How was she able to break the
  resistance of the militant labor movement? What was there to learn from both the early
  nationalizations and the denationalizations that would be of interest to the new
  pragmatists in the USSR?</p>

  <p>While Khrushchev, Malenkov and Bulganin had been treated rudely on their trip,
  Gorbachev was treated with respect and even flattery.</p>

  <p>Symbolism in the two visits should not be overlooked. The troika paid their respects
  at the grave of Marx, a customary act among Communists visiting Britain. Gorbachev
  studiously avoided it.</p>

  <p>Thatcher told the media: "I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business together." But
  what concerned Gorbachev most were the nationalizations of the Atlee period and
  Thatcher's denationalization.</p>

  <h4>Bourgeois nationalization</h4>

  <p>Viewed in the light of Marxist criteria, what is the fundamental difference between
  the nationalizations and denationalizations that have taken place in Britain and those
  in the Soviet Union?</p>

  <p>When the Labor Party took over the industries in Britain, it paid compensation to
  the individual capitalist or corporate owners. There was no expropriation of the
  capitalist class. It was in reality a boon for the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>At the end of the war, Britain was in ruins both industrially and economically.
  Bourgeois nationalization helped improve productivity and thereby strengthened the
  British imperialist bourgeoisie in relation to the workers, who followed the Labor
  leadership.</p>

  <p>When the Thatcher government returned the industries nationalized by previous Labor
  administrations to private ownership, it merely changed the form of capitalist property
  relations, not the essence. The bourgeoisie received their profits during the Labor
  administrations just as they did under the Thatcher regime.</p>

  <p>True, the workers had won significant social advantages during the Labor Party
  period. Thatcher tried to abolish them and introduce onerous anti-working class
  measures. But private ownership of the means of production remained sacrosanct during
  both the Labor and Conservative administrations.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, as a Jan. 6 article in the New York Times pointed out, "Britain's
  large-scale privatization in the 1980s seemed trivial by comparison" with what is
  contemplated in the USSR. Britain took seven years to sell off 43 state-run companies.
  In the former Soviet republics, there is an attempt to sell off 45,000 state-owned
  factories to private owners.</p>

  <p>"Every Eastern European country has failed, and failed significantly, to find new
  owners for state-run enterprises. Trying to sell off one enterprise at a time, as in
  Britain or Mexico, has proved `achingly slow and unrealistic,'" wrote the Times.</p>

  <p>Of course, there were many illusions in the 1940s in Western Europe and in Britain
  about the significance of state takeover of principal industries. It was merely a
  transfer of the legal ownership from individuals or corporations to the capitalist
  state under a Labor Party administration. The Labor Party became the administrator of
  state capitalist property.</p>

  <p>It did not change the status of exploiter to exploited. It was not a change from one
  social system to another. The ownership did not pass from one class to another, as
  happened during the October Revolution in Russia, when ownership of the means of
  production passed from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat. In Britain, the same class
  enjoyed the same, perhaps even higher, profits under the new administrators of the
  capitalist state.</p>

  <p>The legislation under which Britain's iron and steel industry was nationalized can
  be found in Keesing's Contemporary Archives (Nov. 6-13, 1948). It provided for the
  nationalization of "all major firms engaged in the basic process of the iron and steel
  industry and their subsidiary companies."</p>

  <p>Here are some of the provisions:</p>

  <p>"The issued capital of the firms to be transferred is about 105 million pounds,
  while the total amount of government stock required to be issued in compensation is
  estimated at 300 million.</p>

  <p>"For such purposes, the government is to set up an Iron and Steel Corporation of
  Great Britain, to which it is to transfer 107 firms and their subsidiaries, which
  include all those producing 50,000 tons or more of iron ore or 20,000 tons or more of
  pig iron, steel ingots, or hot-rolled steel each year.</p>

  <p>"The firms taken over are to continue as separate units, retaining their ...
  directors and management, but will be responsible to the Iron and Steel Corporation
  instead of to private shareholders. They are to continue to market their own products
  and will be free to compete with each other in price and quality, but will have to
  conform to the general plan of the corporation, which may appoint new directors to the
  boards of individual companies.</p>

  <p>"The Iron and Steel Corporation will consist of a salaried chairman and members
  appointed by the Minister of Supply [from] persons ... of wide experience....</p>

  <p>"Holders of securities vested in the corporation will be compensated by the issue of
  British Iron and Steel stock guaranteed by the Treasury of such value as in the opinion
  of the Treasury is equal to the value of the securities at or about the date of the
  transfer.</p>

  <p>"The corporation will assume all the debts of the companies taken over."</p>

  <p>Foreign companies operating in Britain, like Ford Motor Co., which had its own blast
  furnace, were exempt from nationalization.</p>

  <p>So the British Labor government took over the iron and steel industry by purchasing
  the stock and indebtedness of the corporations. It conducted the operations within the
  framework of the capitalist system.</p>

  <p>Where there had been more than 100 iron and steel companies, it amalgamated them
  into one corporation but allowed them to operate as separate units. Their operations
  were regulated in such a way as to make them profitable at the expense of the
  capitalist state.</p>

  <p>Union contracts were negotiated with the Minister of Supply, who presumably was
  pro-Labor. This enabled the Iron and Steel Corporation to compete on the world market
  and to subsidize individual companies unable to compete on their own.</p>

  <p>The government took what had been a devastated, inefficient multiplicity of steel
  companies and unified them for purposes of world and domestic competition, distributing
  the profits to the same stockholders who had controlled them before
  nationalization.</p>

  <p>If there was an iota of socialism in this, we have yet to find it! It was clearly a
  state capitalist venture. The Labor government may not have had a single industrialist
  in the Cabinet but it acted, as Marx put it in the "Communist Manifesto," as the
  executive committee of the ruling class.</p>

  <p>These are the roots of Gorbachev's experiment in pro- capitalist reforms in the
  USSR, which have today brought the country and all its republics to the very abyss.</p>

  <p>On the continent of Europe, similar mergers such as the Schumann Plan were being
  developed. All of this was part and parcel of a plan to revive the capitalist system,
  which had been shattered by the destructive character of World War II and the emergence
  of the working class as the most formidable factor in the post-war resurgence.</p>

  <p>None of these plans would have been possible had it not been for political and
  economic intervention by the U.S. with billions of dollars to subvert the revolutionary
  process in both France and Italy and to encircle and throttle Eastern Europe.</p>

  <h4>Denationalization in the USSR?</h4>

  <p>Could a seasoned bureaucrat like Gorbachev, who had risen to the top of the
  leadership, view nationalized property in the USSR as fundamentally different from that
  in Britain?</p>

  <p>For Gorbachev, the victory of the proletariat in the struggle against the
  bourgeoisie was part of the distant past. The planned economy and centralized form of
  government in the USSR seemed second best compared to Britain, which had overcome its
  nationalizations and become competitive in the capitalist world.</p>

  <p>The denationalization in Britain, however, was fundamentally different from what is
  going on in the USSR today. To transfer the means of production to the bourgeoisie is
  proving extremely difficult, even in the field of retail distribution, as even the
  Yeltsin administration is finding out.</p>

  <p>An article in the Jan. 3 International Herald Tribune (reported in the Washington
  Post) showed how formidable the transition to a so-called free market in retail
  distribution is for the Yeltsin government.</p>

  <p>"The Russian government's decision to liberalize prices, which came into effect
  Thursday [Jan. 2], was billed as part of a `big bang' approach to creating a free
  market. Mr. Yeltsin and his advisers conjured up the impression of a decisive break
  with 70 years of central planning.</p>

  <p>"A tour of state retail establishments suggests a more prosaic reality. Russia is
  stumbling towards capitalism rather than embracing it overnight."</p>

  <p>Marina Sabirzanova, a manager of a state food store in Moscow, was asked, "How do
  you set prices now that they have been `freed' by the Russian government?" She replied:
  "The same as before. I pick up the phone and make a call."</p>

  <p>Sabirzanova speaks to Tatiana Kondratyeva, a bookkeeper for the state retail
  organization in that district of Moscow. She in turn gets instructions from "higher
  authorities" on how to carry out the "liberalization of prices" Yeltsin decreed.</p>

  <p>They consult a 12-page booklet, which includes a long list of goods and how much
  their prices will be raised by the state.</p>

  <p>What does this article in the Herald Tribune show? First, that state ownership of
  the means of production is still basically intact. No individual in the USSR can claim
  ownership of a steel mill, a mine, a textile plant or a chain of stores.</p>

  <p>Second, prices are not "free" yet but are regulated by the state governing group,
  meaning the current reactionary officialdom. The purpose of raising prices is to
  collect a large amount of money from the masses. It will go into the governing group's
  coffers in order to reduce the deficit incurred by Gorbachev and his successors.</p>

  <p>So far, what Yeltsin has done is regulate prices upward. This is an altogether
  different matter from decontrolling prices altogether and having the so-called free
  capitalist market. For that you first have to privatize, to change the basic foundation
  of the social system from public or state property to private property. That would
  amount to a social counterrevolution, not merely a political counterrevolution from the
  top.</p>

  <p>The Herald Tribune article concluded, "The classic free market mechanism of supply
  and demand was destroyed by the Communists in favor of an artificial distribution
  system and cannot be recreated overnight."</p>

  <p>The planned economy can't be dismantled overnight.</p>

  <p>"Under capitalism, entrepreneurs would respond to higher prices by raising their
  production. As soon as a glut appeared on the market, prices would automatically fall.
  But the `magic wand' of capitalism doesn't work when practically the entire retail
  system, 98 percent of the agricultural land and all large factories are owned and run
  by the state."</p>

  <p>We learn several things from this quote. Some 98 percent of agricultural land is
  still in the hands of the state, as are practically the entire retail system and all
  large factories. So what we have at the initial stage of the privatization drive by
  Yeltsin, at least in the retail sector, is merely the regulation upward of prices by
  the new administrators of the state.</p>

  <p>A capitalist free market is wholly dependent on private ownership. The attempt to
  create free prices is on a collision course with state ownership.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie is showing its disappointment with the progress toward capitalist
  restoration. It has "sold" the free market to the bourgeois intelligentsia, the
  merchants and small entrepreneurs in the USSR. But this is inadequate, as long as the
  state continues to own and control the means of production and distribution.</p>

  <p>So despite six years of capitalist reforms that have ravaged the economy, the
  bourgeois leaders have been unable to definitively crack the basis of the Soviet social
  system- -state ownership of the means of production and distribution.</p>

  <h4>Character of the state</h4>

  <p>The problem is to distinguish the reactionary and corrupt officialdom from the
  social and class character of the economic foundations of the state. The
  nationalizations in the USSR arose from a proletarian revolution. Over a period of 70
  years, a complex of social, political and economic institutions has been developed.
  Despite all the deformations and vandalism the ruling group inflicted on them, these
  institutions remain in essence the skeleton of a new, more progressive social
  system.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a nouveau riche &mdash; a new bourgeoisie &mdash; has been
  cultivated over the years, existing in "the crevices of the social system," as Marx
  said about the bourgeoisie under feudalism.</p>

  <p>Should a new working-class revolution take place to topple the reactionary
  leadership on the top, it would have to start with these existing institutions as a
  foundation for the further construction of socialism. What was built up earlier merely
  has to be renovated, but in a more democratized and efficient way. Privatization would
  disintegrate these institutions, making the task all the more difficult.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the workers' state, in spite of the Yeltsin counterrevolutionary
  leadership, still exists. It would be a grave mistake to throw up one's hands and say,
  "All is lost, we have to start from the beginning."</p>

  <p>What is needed is a consistent, relentless struggle against the new ruling group to
  prevent it from further vandalizing the property of the workers, to halt the process of
  dismantling the workers' property &mdash; while at the same time raising new demands
  that are consistent with the struggle against political reaction and for the
  advancement of socialism.</p>

  <p>To those who ask, Where is the proletariat? and throw up their hands, we must answer
  as Marx did: "The question is not what this or that proletarian or even the whole of
  the proletariat at the moment considers as its aim. The question is what the
  proletariat is and what, consequent on that being, it would be compelled to do."</p>

  <h4>Being determines consciousness</h4>

  <p>Marxism regards the class struggle as the motive force of social evolution. Marx
  said many times that he did not discover the class struggle, but rather the
  relationship between the class struggle and the material interests of the contending
  classes.</p>

  <p>All previous historians and philosophers who recognized the class struggle regarded
  it as the product of ideological, philosophical, or religious ideas. Their view was
  that consciousness preceded and developed the class struggle.</p>

  <p>Marx showed that the class struggle is the product of antagonisms over property
  interests. A political superstructure with ideological, philosophical and religious
  aspects arises to defend those interests.</p>

  <p>It is being that determines consciousness, and not the other way around.</p>

  <p>The definition of a class is of the greatest importance in Marxism. How is a class
  to be defined?</p>

  <p>A class is first of all defined by its relation to the means of production. The
  developments in the USSR are of supreme importance in analyzing the relationship of the
  workers to the means of production.</p>

  <p>The state is obviously in transition from one that maintained, supported and
  developed &mdash; however inefficiently and repressively &mdash; the public ownership
  of the means of production, to one where the superstructure, the political leadership,
  is dedicated to eliminating the very foundation of the state-owned means of
  production.</p>

  <p>However, despite the bourgeois takeover of the political system, it is not a ruling
  class. It is a narrow stratum and, like it or not, must act as caretaker of the
  publicly owned economic system. Every day the bourgeoisie proves unable to overturn
  state property.</p>

  <p>The basic contradiction in Soviet society is between the working class on the one
  hand and the new bourgeoisie on the other. The political leadership will continue to
  straddle the fence. Even as they attempt to destroy the system, they will have to fall
  back on it to save their own skins.</p>

  <p>Let us not forget that after the radical period of the French revolution, the
  Jacobin dictatorship and the Commune, there followed years of reaction. Napoleon was
  declared Emperor and cast aside his revolutionary garments. Eventually the Bourbons
  actually returned to power in France. Yet with all that, feudalism was not
  re-established.</p>

  <p>We must continue to observe the daily developments in the USSR diligently,
  dispassionately and fearlessly to see where the process of development set by Gorbachev
  and contributed to by earlier figures leads.</p>

  <p>The global arena dominated by imperialist finance capital is in one of its deepest
  crises ever. This can only help dispel the illusions of the bourgeois intelligentsia
  and the political officialdom in the Soviet Union and bring revolutionary optimism to
  the vanguard communist elements.</p>
