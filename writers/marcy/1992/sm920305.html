  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: The class basis of the U.S. war against Iraq (March
  5, 1992)</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>The class basis of the U.S. war against Iraq</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 5, 1992)</h5>

  <p>On Feb. 29 New York City will be host to the International War Crimes Tribunal. It
  will be the first anti-war body to indict, prosecute and judge the U.S. government's
  criminal conduct and its merciless war against the Iraqi people.</p>

  <p>It is especially important that this world body will consider the U.S. government's
  conduct and its war against Iraq right in the citadel of imperialism itself. It is one
  thing to condemn U.S. aggression from outside the U.S. It is another matter to be able
  to do it in the belly of the beast itself.</p>

  <p>When the African National Congress last year held its first convention in South
  Africa in nearly three decades, with many foreign guests in attendance, the huge mass
  rally applauded most vigorously at mention of the delegation from Iraq. This is not
  likely to happen in the U.S. at a time when the capitalist press has gone all out in
  its efforts to vilify not only the Iraqi government and its leaders, but the people as
  a whole.</p>

  <p>However, holding the tribunal here is bound to have a significant effect as the
  chauvinist hysteria against Iraq recedes, which it ultimately will.</p>

  <p>The tribunal comes against the background of revelations that the Pentagon is
  planning to expand its war-fighting capability into every corner of the globe at an
  enormous and unprecedented cost. It is going full-steam ahead with such shameless scorn
  and contempt for the public that it leaked the plan to the New York Times, neglecting
  to first show it to the principal members of the Senate and House who have to pass it
  on to Congress as a whole. So even Sam Nunn, a hard-liner on military appropriations in
  the Carter administration and now chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, had to
  publicly protest.</p>

  <h4>Tribunals in Roman times</h4>

  <p>The term tribunal is derived from the Latin <em>tribunus</em>. The tribunal is not a
  strictly judicial body in the sense that it derives its authority from any state. It is
  more like the tribunals that developed in Rome around 470 B.C.</p>

  <p>The tribunal combines within it not only a judicial but an advocacy role. This
  became the practice later in the Roman period when tribunes were the people who
  represented the plebeian (popular) masses as against the patricians (landed
  aristocracy).</p>

  <p>In the second century popular tribunes like Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and his
  brother Caius Sempronius organized a strong resistance among the plebeian masses
  against the patricians, for land reform and debtor relief. The aristocrats had amassed
  enormous wealth at the expense of the plebeian masses, who became indebted to the
  usurers and the latifundians (landed aristocracy).</p>

  <p>The Gracchi brothers lacked judicial or political authority. But by virtue of
  organizing and giving voice to the masses, they exercised power as though they had
  both. The Gracchi brothers were murdered, but later tribunes did attain such
  authority.</p>

  <p>The War Crimes Tribunal does not have state authority to haul in George Bush,
  Richard Cheney, Colin Powell, Norman Schwarzkopf, or CIA head Robert Gates. But it can
  exercise tremendous moral authority by stimulating worldwide sentiment against the
  crimes the U.S. government has committed.</p>

  <p>Moral authority can become a political force once the masses become imbued with it
  and are organized.</p>

  <h4>The Anti-Imperialist League</h4>

  <p>The tribunal comes almost 100 years after the Anti-Imperialist League was formed. It
  was the very first organization in the U.S. to recognize the significance of U.S.
  aggressive policies abroad, especially during and after the Spanish-American War of
  1898.</p>

  <p>A great deal has been written about the role in that war of one of the most venal of
  chauvinist newspapers, William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal. Hearst was no
  passive spectator and chronicler of events.</p>

  <p>The artist Frederic Remington &mdash; whom Hearst had dispatched to Cuba to send
  back pictures of Spanish atrocities and whip up sentiment for a war with Spain &mdash;
  cabled to New York: "Everything is quiet. There is no trouble here. There will be no
  war. I wish to return." Hearst cabled back: "Please remain. You furnish the pictures
  and I'll furnish the war." ("William Randolph Hearst," by John K. Winkler, Avon Books,
  1955)</p>

  <p>Hearst rallied support for the war on the basis that the U.S. would end Spain's
  brutal colonial rule in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. But those who were more
  far-sighted saw it as an imperialist venture by the U.S. to establish its own dominion
  in these countries.</p>

  <p>The Spanish-American War aroused considerable opposition in the U.S. Unfortunately,
  the tide of history seemed to be against the development of a strong anti-imperialist
  movement at that time. For one thing, imperialism as a sociological concept was not yet
  fully understood in the U.S. It was mostly seen as a particular policy pursued by a
  particular administration of the government, such as that of Theodore Roosevelt or
  later Woodrow Wilson.</p>

  <p>It was not understood that imperialism was a specific and organic phase of
  capitalist development, and that the early competitive phase of capitalism was giving
  way to its monopolist stage.</p>

  <p>There was a progressive working class struggle raging, but the socialists' attention
  at the time was mostly turned to the white workers. Inadequate attention was paid to
  the Black struggle, when the Black masses were chained to virtual semi-servitude and
  the revolutionary gains made during the period of Reconstruction had been abandoned by
  the Northern bourgeoisie in collusion with the Southern Bourbons.</p>

  <p>This is a highly instructive lesson in the class politics of the bourgeoisie. It
  should be gone over again and again in order to organize the multi-national working
  class in independent and irreconcilable struggle against the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <h4>Divorcing two aspects of same struggle</h4>

  <p>At that time, the leaders of the working class, except for the most militant, like
  Eugene V. Debs, conducted the class struggle separately from the struggle against
  capitalist and imperialist war. On the other hand, the most progressive elements among
  the liberal bourgeoisie and radical intellectuals directed their efforts against
  imperialist intervention, but didn't necessarily see it as an extension of capitalist
  development. So on both sides the working class struggle at home was seen as separate
  from the question of imperialist expansion and war.</p>

  <p>This unfortunate dichotomy that began 100 years ago still needs to be bridged. The
  anti-war movement has only recently begun to address workers as a class.</p>

  <p>This divorce between the two most important aspects of the struggle against
  capitalist exploitation does not come from a lack of intellectual capacity. It can only
  be explained on the basis of the monstrous growth of monopoly capitalism.</p>

  <p>At the turn of the century, roughly the time when the Anti-Imperialist League was
  formed, the concept that imperialism was a stage in the development of capitalism was
  first emerging. It took on ever more vigorous momentum in the years that followed.</p>

  <p>When the Standard Oil Company was formed in 1911 after the Supreme Court dissolved
  the Standard Oil Trust, the Rockefellers elicited strong but contradictory reactions.
  The liberal and progressive press pilloried them for their greed and avarice, but the
  capitalist press praised them for their philanthropic endeavors.</p>

  <p>Few if any saw the growth of the Rockefeller oil empire as a product of the organic
  tendency of capitalist development to stretch its tentacles outside the U.S. Few made
  the connection between the struggle for the division of markets, especially in oil, and
  imperialist war.</p>

  <h4>Connecting symptoms with causes</h4>

  <p>Yet the Rockefellers were already building a worldwide empire. Just a year after
  Standard Oil was formed, it culminated a long struggle with Royal Dutch and Shell by
  opening a subsidiary in far-off Indonesia, then a Dutch colony.</p>

  <p>Even in 1975, after the so-called energy crisis arising out of the OPEC oil boycott,
  the author Anthony Sampson fell far short of linking these seven giant oil companies,
  which he described so well in "The Seven Sisters" (Viking Press, New York), with
  imperialism and its ultimate consequence &mdash; war.</p>

  <p>Likewise, while a later book by Peter R. Odell ("Oil and World Power," 1982), dealt
  with the Arab-Israeli War, it did not by a long shot see the oil monopolists as
  principal fomenters and instigators of imperialist war.</p>

  <p>Even Harvey O'Connor, well-known as a radical when he wrote "The Empire of Oil"
  (Monthly Review Press, 1955), had the same limitations. When the Arab-Israeli War of
  1967 broke out, this writer phoned O'Connor in an effort to get him to endorse a
  demonstration against U.S.-Israeli aggression in the Middle East. His answer: Oh no,
  it's the Arabs who are the aggressors.</p>

  <p>His view flowed strictly from the formal standpoint of who fired the first shots. It
  discarded altogether the relationship between oppressor and oppressed that he himself
  had shown in his books.</p>

  <p>Would anyone ask today which side fired the first shot in the American
  Revolution?</p>

  <p>Right now so-called peace talks engineered by U.S. Secretary of State James Baker
  are taking place between a Palestinian and an Israeli delegation. In the midst of these
  negotiations, the Israelis launched a massive attack against Lebanon. The Lebanese and
  Palestinian masses retaliated by attacking Israeli positions. The Israelis, of course,
  insist that the Palestinians fired the first shot.</p>

  <p>Hanan Ashrawi, chief spokesperson for the Palestinian delegation, says this is
  merely discussing the symptoms but not the cause &mdash; which is the Israelis' illegal
  occupation of Palestine. She might have added that the fundamental cause is the
  intrusion of imperialism into Arab lands for the sole purpose of ravaging their wealth
  and resources, most of all oil.</p>

  <p>The first to raise the question of imperialism as a new phenomenon in capitalist
  development was the English economist J.A. Hobson, who was later followed by the
  Austrian Marxist Rudolf Hilferding. Lenin brought it all up to date in his classic
  analysis, "Imperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism." How little it is understood
  today. Lenin didn't just describe imperialism but showed that imperialist war was a
  product of capitalism. He also showed that it was the precursor to socialist
  revolution.</p>

  <h4>Fighting World War I</h4>

  <p>At the time of World War I, this country's most outstanding fighter against the
  imperialist bloodbath was Eugene Victor Debs. He had developed from a militant and
  widely loved trade union leader into a revolutionary socialist with an internationalist
  perspective. Debs spoke out passionately against the war.</p>

  <p>In a letter to Upton Sinclair in 1915, when Europe was already at war and the U.S.
  was preparing to join in, Debs wrote: "I want the workers to prepare to resist and put
  an end to ... our own predatory plutocracy right here at home. I do not know of any
  foreign buccaneers that could come nearer skinning the American workers to the bone
  than is now being done by the Rockefellers and their pirate pals. The workers have no
  country to fight for. It belongs to the capitalists and plutocrats. Let them worry over
  its defense, and when they declare wars as they and they alone do, let them also go out
  and slaughter one another on the battlefields." (From "Eugene V. Debs" by Ray Ginger,
  Collier Books, 1962)</p>

  <p>Later asked if he was opposed to all wars, Debs replied: "I am not a capitalist
  soldier; I am a proletarian revolutionist. ... I am opposed to every war but one; I am
  for that war with heart and soul, and that is the worldwide war of the social
  revolution. In that war I am prepared to fight in any way the ruling class may make
  necessary, even to the barricades. That is where I stand and where I believe the
  Socialist Party stands, or ought to stand, on the question of war."</p>

  <p>His position was similar to that of the Zimmerwaldists in the European social
  democratic movement. They met after the outbreak of the war, called for the workers to
  turn their guns against their own capitalists and denounced the social democratic
  leaders who had voted for war credits.</p>

  <p>Even as early as 1912, the socialist leaders had met in Basel, Switzerland. They
  passed a resolution that if capitalist war broke out, the workers' duty was not to
  support this or that capitalist country but to use the war crisis and turn it into a
  struggle against capitalism. All the socialist leaders who attended the conference had
  supported that resolution.</p>

  <p>But when the war actually broke out, it was another matter.</p>

  <h4>Lenin at Zimmerwald</h4>

  <p>The German Social Democratic Party, the leading party in the world socialist
  movement at the time, capitulated to the wave of chauvinism. With the sole exception of
  Karl Liebknecht, its deputies in the Reichstag voted for war appropriations. The French
  Socialists then followed suit, as did the Belgians, Italians and others.</p>

  <p>Those in the Socialist International who regarded this as an act of treachery met in
  Zimmerwald, Switzerland, in September 1915 to decide what to do. The betrayal had had a
  catastrophic effect, virtually destroying the International as a force in the world
  struggle against capitalism.</p>

  <p>The tremendous shock, confusion and demoralization that followed the collapse of the
  Socialist International can in some measure be compared to the effect Gorbachev's and
  then Yeltsin's capitulation to imperialism &mdash; which had been foreshadowed by
  earlier administrations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union &mdash; has had on
  the movement today.</p>

  <p>Even at Zimmerwald, the socialist leaders were divided. The more moderate grouping
  confined itself to general pronouncements against the capitalist war. But Lenin's
  program carried the struggle forward to a more practical political stage. He said it
  was the workers' duty to turn their guns against the capitalists. The issue was not
  which capitalist was the lesser evil or which had started the shooting.</p>

  <p>The duty of the workers in each capitalist country was to regard the defeat of their
  own capitalist government as the lesser evil. This was hard for the moderates to
  accept.</p>

  <p>From then until the end of his life, Lenin continued to promote the view that
  workers in each imperialist country should regard their own capitalist government as
  the fundamental enemy. That would have the effect of uniting the proletariat in
  solidarity against imperialist war rather than just abstractly denouncing it.</p>

  <p>The Zimmerwaldists who sided with Lenin were called the "defeatist" tendency &mdash;
  for the defeat of their own capitalist governments by class struggle warfare. Of
  course, they were not for aiding the enemy. The others were called the defensists.</p>

  <p>This was classic Leninism. After his death, it was watered down beyond recognition
  into pure bourgeois pacifism. (See "Bolsheviks and War" by Sam Marcy, WW Publishers,
  1985)</p>

  <h4>Debs and the Socialist Party</h4>

  <p>In the United States, Debs too wanted to make a clean break from the
  "war-socialists" in the Socialist International. But such prominent leaders in the U.S.
  Socialist Party as Morris Hillquit and Victor Berger opposed him.</p>

  <p>The Socialist Party did meet in an emergency convention in St. Louis on April 17,
  1917, the day after the U.S. entered the war. The party issued a strong anti-war
  document endorsed by 80 percent of the delegates. When this report was later submitted
  to a nationwide referendum of the party, it received an even higher vote.</p>

  <p>"The Socialist Party of the United States," read the statement, "in the present
  grave crisis reaffirms its allegiance to the principle of internationalism and working
  class solidarity the world over, and proclaims its unalterable opposition to the war
  just declared by the government of the United States....</p>

  <p>"The ghastly war in Europe was not caused by an accidental event, nor by the policy
  or institutions of any single nation. It was the logical outcome of the competitive
  capitalist system...."</p>

  <p>The Socialist Party stood by this only as long as there was merely preparation for
  the war. But Congress soon passed the Sedition Act, and those opposing the war were
  jailed by the hundreds.</p>

  <p>The economy began to boom with war production, and a campaign of violence and
  hysteria against the socialists took hold. Their meetings against the war, which had
  attracted tens of thousands in small and large cities and towns across the country
  began to falter. Debs himself was indicted under the new Sedition Act for his militant
  speeches against the war. He served two-and-a-half years of a 10-year sentence before
  he was finally pardoned in 1921 by President Warren Harding.</p>

  <p>The resolution passed in St. Louis, while not as sharp as Lenin's formulation, would
  have been quite adequate within the framework of the U.S. had the Socialist Party lived
  up to it.</p>

  <p>Debs had condemned the European Socialist leaders as traitors to the movement. But
  it was one thing to see the treachery of the Socialist leaders in Europe; it was
  another matter altogether to be able to prepare the Party to organize against the
  war.</p>

  <p>The capitalist government led by Woodrow Wilson had begun lining up the masses for
  war with its "preparedness campaign." The capitalist press almost uniformly began a
  most jingoistic, chauvinist tirade &mdash; not merely flag-waving but inciting
  wholesale intimidation of workers' organizations and particularly of anti-war
  demonstrations.</p>

  <p>Debs himself was aware of the disarray in the movement and the inevitable confusion
  in the party as the result of the witch-hunt. But unfortunately he proved incapable of
  taking the bull by the horns. He did not go to the St. Louis convention &mdash; which
  while it had moderate socialists and right-wingers as well as some ultra-lefts,
  nevertheless passed this important resolution which for that time was highly
  progressive.</p>

  <p>Instead of asserting his strong moral and political leadership, he who disdained
  factionalism did not see the necessity for vigorously intervening and pushing the
  revolutionary position he had made public on many occasions. Even after several
  carloads of workers drove 100 miles from the convention to his house in Terre Haute,
  Ind., to entreat him to come, he still stayed away.</p>

  <p>What can be learned from this convention is that the Socialist Party at that time,
  while it was broad in scope, did not have the necessary discipline. It was based too
  much on voluntarism. It was by no means a Bolshevik Party of the type Lenin had built
  up in Russia to fight against the war and the capitalists.</p>

  <h4>Characteristics of a Leninist party</h4>

  <p>The imperialist holocaust and the subsequent struggles of the working class showed
  that in the face of a sudden attack leaders are sometimes paralyzed by indecision. They
  may be overly influenced by the temporary confusion among the masses and get engulfed
  by the war psychosis deliberately created by the imperialist press, which itself is
  basically an agent of the warmongering ruling class.</p>

  <p>Debs never retracted his firm convictions. He continued his revolutionary position
  against the war. But where he failed was as a party leader. The party itself was not
  fully prepared for the war; it was not organized on the kind of basis that would enable
  it to meet the challenge of a witch-hunt. It lacked the flexibility to be able to
  combine legal and illegal actions during an imperialist holocaust; to adjust itself
  when, after a growing mass movement, there is a temporary decline; and then to prepare
  for a recovery of the struggle.</p>

  <p>One of the fundamental teachings of Leninism was on how to prepare the party to
  survive during periods when it is only a small circle, then move to the head of the
  masses when later there's a stormy period, but retain the flexibility to adjust itself
  to a decline of the movement by correctly analyzing each new relationship of class
  forces. It must learn how to retreat in the face of superior forces and how to regroup,
  all without abandoning its revolutionary positions.</p>

  <p>The U.S. Socialist Party was not prepared for the twists and turns of a war
  situation. It had had no real experience. Basically, it had adapted to gradualist
  struggle, unlike the Bolsheviks who went through three revolutions and were able to
  adjust themselves to new situations (although not without great losses).</p>

  <p>At the present time, as the U.S. takes on itself the role of mastering, exploiting
  and oppressing the rest of the world, what is needed more than ever is a thoroughgoing
  proletarian organization that has assimilated the lessons of the worldwide revolutions.
  One of the most crucial teachings of Leninism, as borne out by experience on a world
  scale in the relationship between oppressor and oppressed, is that peace under
  capitalism, as Lenin tirelessly explained, is only an interval between imperialist
  wars.</p>
