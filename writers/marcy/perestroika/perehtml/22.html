  <h2>The miners' strike: working class resurgence</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>Soviet coal miners "storm the heavens." Strike marks dawn of new period for
    working class. Gorbachev had to show sympathy and settle strike quickly. But miners'
    grievances flow from economic reforms which benefit thin layer at expense of workers.
    Comparison of this crisis to China and Poland. Imperialists hope strike will disrupt
    planned economy. Miners demand a curb on private entrepreneurs. Political autonomy
    vs. economic autonomy. Are workers challenging the state  &ndash;  or are they themselves the
    state? Distinction between workers' state and governing group. Class character of
    Soviet state. Problem of relations between social base and superstructure.</strong>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>The strike of the Soviet coal miners, which began July 10, 1989, in
  western Siberia, spread to the Donets region of the Ukraine, and then enveloped most of
  the coal-mining regions of the USSR, is the most dramatic and significant development
  in the Soviet Union in all the years of the Gorbachev administration.</p>

  <p>The strike is now over, and the very fact that there was a settlement is in itself
  an enormous phenomenon in Soviet labor relations. It is not so much what the workers
  won, although this is estimated to be considerable and substantial. It is the fact that
  they have won it. That the Prime Minister of the Soviet Union, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, met
  in the Kremlin with the mine workers' strike committee is itself of formidable
  significance.</p>

  <p>By this act alone, by having to "storm the heavens" (to borrow a phrase from Marx
  written in a different historical context), the workers have leaped from being a mere
  economic category to being a class unto itself.</p>

  <p>The picture of Ryzhkov meeting with the strikers cannot but make every progressive,
  every class-conscious worker and every collective farmer feel that a new day has
  arrived. Pride and solidarity with the workers is bound to soar. The long period when
  the workers seemed dormant, inarticulate and indifferent is coming to an end.</p>

  <p>The workers are now in a transition period. Their political consciousness is being
  transformed. They will no longer be a bourgeois economic category such as wholesale or
  retail trade, raw materials, or transportation  &ndash;  inanimate categories manipulated by
  the higher-ups. They will again become the most formidable political entity, as they
  were when their organized strength became the foundation of the USSR. They will achieve
  the aspirations of their early leaders  &ndash;  to make the working class the most developed,
  educated and consistently socialist class in the construction of a communist
  society.</p>

  <p>Imperialist ideologues dream of returning the Soviet working class to the antiquated
  bourgeois system. This, however, is a reactionary utopia and an anachronism from the
  past which does not fit the immense socialist potential of the USSR.</p>

  <p>It is no wonder that all Soviet society is now convulsed by the sudden appearance of
  this truly extraordinary phenomenon. For the moment, all groupings, political
  organizations and strata of Soviet society are groping with how to define their
  attitude, not just toward the miners, but also toward the working class as a whole,
  which is represented by the miners at present. There is no question that sympathy is
  overwhelmingly on the side of the mine workers. Gorbachev himself has been obliged to
  all but declare his own solidarity with the miners and to move expeditiously to settle
  the strike and put it on the agenda for discussion and review by the Supreme Soviet,
  the parliament.</p>

  <p>For too long we have heard the voices of the so-called dissidents in the USSR, who
  are really bourgeois elements hostile to socialism and full of praise for the wonders
  of the capitalist West. Indeed, this narrow stratum of Soviet society has occupied the
  political arena almost to the exclusion of any but official government spokespeople.
  Now, at last, the whole world will hear the voice of the Soviet working class through
  one of the most critically important detachments of the great proletarian army of the
  USSR. They are now the topic of discussion in the Supreme Soviet, the Central Committee
  of the Communist Party and the Council of Ministers (the cabinet).</p>

  <p>Only yesterday the important topics under discussion were how to appease the growing
  bourgeois interest in private cooperatives, the mushrooming of independent private
  entrepreneurs, plans for a volunteer and professional army, taxation, and the national
  budget. But now all this has disappeared from the agenda. The settlement of the miners'
  strike and what it may portend for the future is suddenly the main focus of all these
  central bodies of the Soviet government.</p>

  <p>The miners' strike is, of course, not the first strike in the Gorbachev
  administration. There have been perhaps dozens of strikes by workers ranging from bus
  drivers to librarians. Although these have been sporadic, localized and of short
  duration, they nevertheless should have offered a clue to what was brewing. At the
  least, the government should have been publicly occupied with a critical examination of
  this data and made recommendations. It did not.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev supporters, however, are quick to point out that the central government
  acted rapidly to deal with the strikers, dispatched a high-level delegation of
  Politburo members to meet with them, and made substantial concessions. This means, they
  say, that greater attention will be paid not only to the miners, but also to the
  working class as a whole. Of course, what is conveniently forgotten is that it took the
  pressure of the strike to accomplish this. Gorbachev himself had to make a special
  appeal on television to the miners in the Donets Basin of the Ukraine. Had the
  Gorbachev administration acted on its own two or three years ago, that would have
  demonstrated foresight and keen interest in the condition of the workers. Moreover, if
  a settlement like the one made with the miners had also been made with steelworkers,
  textile workers, transportation workers, etc., that would have been an altogether
  different matter. To carry the point further, if all of the really bona fide
  negotiations with representatives of the working class had been carried out pursuant to
  the Comprehensive Plan first proposed in skeleton form at a 1985 plenary session of the
  Communist Party Central Committee, it would really have been exemplary of proletarian
  democracy and socialist, centralized planning. But that didn't happen.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev administration has staked a great deal on the Comprehensive Plan,
  which promises to revolutionize society and its basic institutions. As it turns out,
  however, in document after document and decision after decision issued by the Central
  Committee on this plan, no provision was made for the unanticipated intervention of the
  workers. It was all shrouded in vague generalities.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev cannot but be aware that the miners' strike has brought him face to face
  with a most serious political crisis, one flowing from his complex plans for
  restructuring Soviet society. The crisis is not caused solely by the conservatives
  among the Party cadres, or their "unwillingness to change." The crisis has a social
  character in that the new managerial system shifts the burden to the vast majority of
  the workers while a thin layer of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois elements thrives
  handsomely.</p>

  <p>No matter how much Gorbachev may blame the lower echelons of the Party, no matter
  how much he may excoriate the coal industry officialdom or the trade union apparatus,
  as he has done in the face of the resurgent workers, this will be of no avail, for
  neither personnel nor organizational difficulties are at the root of the problem. The
  root of the problem is the bourgeois character of the reforms. Relentlessly, they
  gravitate toward the capitalist market and they foster the growth of social inequality
  among the masses.</p>

  <p>Only a short while ago the top administrators were still scolding the workers for
  "wage leveling" and for "petty bourgeois egalitarianism," barbs that are aimed at
  undermining working class solidarity in the struggle against bureaucratic privileges.
  It will be interesting to see if this vicious and slanderous campaign will now finally
  come to an end.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev is not altogether in a strong position to blame the Party. After all, he
  has headed it now for four years, long enough to have made his position clear on the
  very matters the miners have brought to his attention, if not to make the necessary
  changes. He has cultivated a variety of neobourgeois elements from the periphery of
  Soviet society, helping them to win posts and occupy prominent roles at the 19th Party
  Conference. These elements are now the principal critics of his policy from the right,
  yet he relies on them in the struggle against genuine left elements. Gorbachev stands
  with one leg in the camp of the outright bourgeois reformers and the other in the
  Party. But the middle ground is being cut from under his feet.</p>

  <p>His attempt to coopt the strikers with an ingratiating TV speech and the expeditious
  manner in which the strike was settled may temporarily strengthen him. Yet he cannot
  but know that on the whole he has lost ground. Gorbachev, who eagerly breaks ranks from
  a parade to shake hands and kiss babies in the capitals of the imperialist world,
  showing that he is a man of the people, was not one to don miners' clothes and go down
  into the Siberian pits or to the Donets basin in the Ukraine. He did not go underground
  with the miners to emphasize solidarity with them, as he might have done had he felt he
  would be well received.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev and his associates must also ponder the significance of the suppression of
  the counterrevolutionary elements in China. Some in the West see a possible similar
  development in the USSR. That, too, is the product of a total misunderstanding of the
  driving forces in China and in the USSR. The Chinese government was confronted with a
  bourgeois opposition which had grown to counterrevolutionary proportions. The Gorbachev
  administration at this moment is confronted not with a bourgeois opposition, not with
  an opposition oriented to Western imperialism, but with a veritable working class
  rebellion of potentially revolutionary dimensions.</p>

  <p>Nor is the situation analogous to what is happening in Poland. The Polish workers'
  state did not issue from a proletarian socialist revolution, as did the USSR. True,
  there was a revolutionary social change, but the main task of defeating the Nazis and
  the Polish bourgeoisie fell to the Soviet Army. It should not be forgotten that the
  Polish People's Republic, which established itself in 1947 and gained recognition from
  the Western imperialist allies, is the historical survival of the coalition forced upon
  the Polish revolutionary movement at the Yalta Conference of 1945.</p>

  <p>No matter how meritorious the economic grievances of the workers in Poland have been
  in the past, the strikes led by Solidarity have long served the interests of the
  imperialist powers, mainly the U.S., with Britain, France and Germany as junior
  partners. Never to be forgotten is that for many years now, the Polish economy has been
  completely dominated by Western banks. Now a coalition government has been formed with
  Solidarity. It is a coalition in which the bourgeoisie dominates and the more
  progressive anti-imperialist elements are forced to toe the line laid down by the IMF.
  Such a situation has no relevance to what is taking place in the heart of the Soviet
  working class today.</p>

  <p>The world bourgeoisie are not at all disinterested bystanders in the miners'
  struggle in the Soviet Union. They follow every development closely, looking for
  opportunities to intervene politically and subvert the system. At this early stage in
  the reemergence of the working class in the political arena, the world bourgeoisie are
  still trying to assess the situation and define their attitude to this utterly
  unanticipated phenomenon. It is thus with malicious delight that the Wall Street
  Journal, in an editorial entitled "Soviet Workers Arise," said that "For those in the
  West who are rooting for reforms in the Soviet bloc, an aggressive, determined,
  independent and organized labor movement ... would be an optimistic development
  indeed." <sup><a href="#1.">1</a></sup> So thinks this organ of high finance.</p>

  <p>Another view shared by most of the capitalist press at this moment was expressed by
  Flora Lewis in the New York Times. She is more cautious and much more solicitous of
  Gorbachev. In fact, the tone of her column is one of hope that Gorbachev will succeed
  with his "courageous" and "wise" tactics to win the confidence of the striking workers.
  Lewis says, "It's a moment of tremendous delicacy. So far Mr. Gorbachev's skill and
  audacity seem up to it. The test is at hand." <sup><a href="#2.">2</a></sup></p>

  <p>The imperialists fully understand the significance of democratic centralized
  planning for socialist development and are all too eager to see it disrupted, if not
  wrecked, as has happened in Yugoslavia, Poland and Hungary. The imperialists hope that
  the miners' strike will encourage other strikes of long duration that will disrupt the
  economic plans of the USSR and thereby open it to further capitalist inroads. But this
  scenario, like that of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, is based not
  upon fact, but on wishful thinking and deep-seated hatred of the socialist
  countries.</p>

  <p>For many years, and even at this moment, the size and influence of the bourgeois
  elements in the Soviet Union has been highly exaggerated. The main danger is not from
  outright bourgeois elements but from the liberal reformists, articulate petty-bourgeois
  intellectuals, professionals and scientists enjoying inordinate privileges in this
  workers' state, both in and outside of the Gorbachev administration, who have in the
  last few years been more attracted by the fraudulent capitalist prosperity of the West
  and the capitalist market than by the potentialities of reforming Soviet society in a
  genuine communist direction. But their influence over the workers and peasants, if any,
  is highly questionable.</p>

  <p>According to an article in the July 26, 1989, New York Times, the miners have called
  for "the abolition or curtailment of the private entrepreneurs." These elements, the
  Times said, while having amassed wealth under the new economic order that Gorbachev is
  trying to build, are strongly resented. The workers, who are the absolute majority of
  the population, are not at all as enthused by it as the capitalist press would have had
  us believe all these months! The Times reporter writes that the blue-collar workers are
  not supportive of modernizing and restructuring plans if that means closing so-called
  "bankrupt industries," deregulating prices (i.e., raising prices of consumer goods),
  and laying off "surplus" workers. These practices are characteristic of capitalism, but
  would be wholly new to the USSR if the Gorbachev plans go through. The workers are for
  modernization, but on the basis of a socialist, planned economy.</p>

  <p>There has been much said about the miners' demand for autonomy. Local political
  autonomy is a correct demand within the framework of a multinational state. Economic
  autonomy, however, oriented to the capitalist market, disrupts socialist planning. Some
  in the media in the Soviet Union are emphasizing the workers' interest in greater
  economic autonomy, profit-sharing, etc.  &ndash;  bourgeois reforms which have drained
  proletarian socialist consciousness  &ndash;  but time and experience will demonstrate that
  this is only a momentary concern. For four years the Gorbachev administration has been
  promising the workers that these measures will ultimately bring about social and
  economic benefits.</p>

  <p>The miners' strike and the world attention focused on it have once again pushed to
  the fore fundamental questions of theory and practice regarding the nature of the
  Soviet state in general and of the social character of the Soviet Union in particular.
  For example, both the extreme right-wing stand taken in the Wall Street Journal and the
  more moderate bourgeois view in the New York Times have this in common: They view the
  miners' strike as a challenge to the Soviet state. However, it is not the Soviet state
  that is being challenged.</p>

  <p>What is happening? The state itself is challenging the governing group of the state.
  The difference is fundamental and worth pondering over.</p>

  <p>The state is an instrument of a specific class defined by its relation to the means
  of production. The governing group, on the other hand, merely administers the state.
  Confusing the state with its administrators merely obscures the real relationships that
  govern society.</p>

  <p>The governing group of a workers' state may administer it well and efficiently, in a
  revolutionary manner, as was done during the early years of the Bolshevik era. Or it
  can represent the state badly, inflict untold hardship on the masses and enact policies
  that erode the very class foundation of the state. Nevertheless, the state is and
  remains a state of the workers and peasants.</p>

  <p>The identification of the Soviet state with its bureaucratic governing groups and
  its political apparatus is a gross misconception disseminated by the bourgeoisie to
  obscure the class character of the Soviet Union. Imperialism must hide the fact that
  the ruling class in a socialist state is the working class. Even if for many years the
  workers' voice has been stifled, their capabilities limited, and their freedom and
  initiative seriously curtailed, nevertheless, it is still the state of the workers and
  peasants. No part of this state is owned by the administrators. In fact, the miners'
  strike has shown once again that while the Soviet Union has gone through periods when
  its working class foundations seemed endangered, these periods of erosion have been
  followed by vigorous and dynamic growth.</p>

  <p>The USSR has experienced a number of governing groups over the last 70 years, while
  the state itself has remained fundamentally unaltered. The governing groups have never
  been anything else but the administrators of the state, even in the brightest days of
  the Leninist period. At that time there was, of course, the greatest identity of
  interests between the administrators of the state and the workers' and peasants' state
  itself.</p>

  <p>It is altogether different under capitalism. For example, when Donald Regan resigned
  as head of the Treasury and also as chief of staff for the U.S. president under the
  Reagan administration, he remained a capitalist. Even though he did not take a legal
  portion of the capitalist state with him, he had control of vast amounts of
  property.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if Nikolai Ryzhkov or Gorbachev himself should leave office, they
  do not take along with them any ownership of the means of production. Their social
  status might be that of a pensioner, or they could find another occupation, but
  whatever they might be doing, they would not become capitalists.</p>

  <p>To confuse the governing group of a state with the state itself serves the
  bourgeoisie well. It most often gets them off the hook in times of struggle with the
  workers, and diverts attention onto the governing group, which may be easily dispensed
  with, legally or otherwise.</p>

  <p>Throughout its long and bloody history, the bourgeoisie has always tried to confuse
  the class foundations of its states with its governing groups. The bourgeoisie is
  almost always displeased with its governing groups, whether they be conservatives or
  liberals, Christian Democrats or left-wing Socialists, or an occasional coalition of
  Communists and Socialists. Over the last 50 years a vast number of governing groups of
  the bourgeoisie have come and gone as though through a revolving door. But the class
  foundations of the capitalist states, that is, the industrialists, the bankers, the
  multinational corporations that hold and have legal title to most of the resources,
  remain the same. Indeed, the bulk of the wealth in the world remains in their
  hands.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie does not like to popularize this aspect of the Marxist conception of
  the state. It is much more to their interest to pass off a particular governing group
  as the state rather than to show that the state is in reality based on who owns the
  means of production, distribution and exchange, transport and communications. All this
  makes up the state.</p>

  <p>The problem of the Soviet state is the problem of the relation of the social
  structure to its superstructure; it is the problem of the relation of the economic
  foundations to the political administration, that is, the relation of the class to its
  leaders. The Soviet state has survived decades of struggle between the structure and
  the superstructure, now hidden, now open, and sometimes even violent. The governing
  group, the officialdom or the bureaucracy is not the state. It can act on the state's
  behalf, ignore it or even repress it, but it is not the state.</p>

  <p>There comes a time, however, when the relation between the structure and the
  superstructure reaches a crisis. At such a time the workers step into the political
  arena, as the miners have done, and reveal to the whole world who in fact is the
  state.</p>

  <p>This is of world historic significance. It is the real meaning of the miners'
  strike.</p>
