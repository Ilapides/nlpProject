  December 8, 1988</h5>

  <h2>North and south: National tensions and economic change</h2>

  <blockquote>
    The 19th Party Conference. Freedom to criticize &ndash; but only past
    policies. Underdevelopment and national antagonisms. Strategy of imperialism toward
    Moslem fundamentalism. Sakharov promotes Armenian bourgeois elements. The Estonian
    "popular front." Estonia's history between the wars. Gorbachev's concessions to
    Western public opinion. Can USSR avoid growth of bourgeois nationalism?</strong>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>While Gorbachev was basking in the sunlight of summitry politics with the
  U.S. and absorbing a flood of flattery from the imperialist press not too long ago,
  forces hostile to socialism were working, not too quietly, to undermine the very
  pillars of the national structure of the USSR. For a while it seemed that Gorbachev and
  his collaborators were either not noticing or not paying much attention to the serious
  developments casting a dark shadow over the glowing accounts of perestroika and
  glasnost.</p>

  <p>For instance, as late as the spring of 1988, when Gorbachev visited Yugoslavia, he
  was asked by reporters how he could explain the disorders that had taken place in
  Armenia and Azerbaijan. Gorbachev answered with a question. "Name me a country," he
  said, "which doesn't have problems like these." But that is exactly the point! Hadn't
  progressives always thought of the USSR as being different from the capitalist
  countries, which are in a continual process of suppressing national minorities? Was
  Gorbachev deliberately putting the USSR on a level with bourgeois regimes?</p>

  <p>Didn't he get the message of the rebellion in Kazakhstan in 1986? It came after the
  head of the Party in the republic was removed and replaced by an ethnic Russian. The
  response of the Gorbachev regime was to denounce irresponsible young people, hoodlums
  and the like. If he overlooked the significance of Kazakhstan, could he have forgotten
  what happened first in Armenia and then in the city of Sumgait in Azerbaijan just this
  February? The blood spilled there was hardly dry when Gorbachev visited Yugoslavia.</p>

  <p>Then came preparations for the great event, the 19th Party Conference in June 1988.
  This was heralded as the opportunity for an all-out debate. It would be a great
  demonstration of the democratic transformation of the USSR that would put the whole
  country on a new historic plateau. Again, some in the bourgeois press pulled out all
  stops in praise of the new thinking, the new demonstration of tolerance, of criticism,
  of give and take. But look closer. Who was really doing all the debating? Who was doing
  all the criticism? Was there any criticism of Gorbachev and his administration?</p>

  <p>Was even one person able to get up and forthrightly state that he or she was opposed
  to perestroika in principle? Did anyone say it was a return to petty bourgeois
  commodity production and the enrichment of the upper layers of Soviet society, that
  cooperative enterprises which rent the collectivized lands for as long as 50 years are
  a cover for free bourgeois enterprises? Did anyone blame the Gorbachev regime for the
  food crisis, or was it all heaped on their predecessors, the period of so-called
  stagnation under Brezhnev? And did anyone feel free to link the growing inequality
  between persons and regions to the rise of nationalist antagonisms?</p>

  <p>But never mind that. There were great big issues to discuss. Yes, such as the
  question of Kazakhstan. How about discussing that, as well as the disorders in
  Azerbaijan and in Armenia? Was the fact brought up that the Party apparatus in both
  states was swept away by mass demonstrations, and that the Party leadership, whatever
  influence it might have had, had vanished into thin air?</p>

  <p>Was it enough to say, as Gorbachev did, that all these problems grew out of the past
  period, and that he should get credit for bringing the matter into the open by
  stimulating democratic processes? Did it suffice that one or two self-serving
  representatives, carefully chosen by the Gorbachev regime from Armenia and Azerbaijan,
  made presentations that covered up rather than revealed the growing danger, which was
  spreading daily? Did anybody among the delegates note, for example, that the Ayatollah
  Khomeini's picture was appearing on flags and placards in the demonstrations in Baku?
  Did they think that had any meaning?</p>

  <p>It seems that only the writer and historian Roy Medvedev, who is outside the Party
  and whose bourgeois leanings to the West are only too well known, will bring up such
  matters, discussing them with the bourgeois press. Medvedev recognizes the danger
  involved, but the Gorbachev regime seems to have turned a blind eye to it.</p>

  <p>There is a problem of underdevelopment in the republics. Wherever there is no
  clear-cut communist solution based upon equality, they will inevitably become prey to
  bourgeois demagogy, which can clothe itself in reactionary religious forms. This should
  have been taken into consideration a long time ago, when the Khomeini regime first
  consolidated its reactionary dictatorship over the Iranian people.</p>

  <p>One of the long-term strategies of U.S. imperialism, ever since Khomeini came to
  power (and it explains their equivocal attitude toward him), is to turn Moslem
  fundamentalism, headed by the Khomeini regime, into a spearhead against the Soviet
  Union. This has been openly talked about in the U.S. over a period of years. Under
  these circumstances, it is sheer folly not to have paid the greatest attention to this
  problem. Even if concessions of an extraordinary character were called for, they should
  have been made to overcome the underdeveloped state of the economy in Azerbaijan and to
  a lesser extent in Armenia.</p>

  <p>Even back in Lenin's day, it was clear (as we have pointed out in earlier articles)
  that the New Economic Policy, necessary as it was, encouraged the growth of Great
  Russian chauvinism and cultivated bourgeois traits of acquisitiveness and individualism
  in economic relations. But this was recognized as a great danger and the Party was on
  guard against it.</p>

  <p>The policy of perestroika has reignited and fanned the flames of ancient
  nationalism. A solution can be found to the national question by addressing the
  problems created by perestroika, not by reinforcing the bourgeois economic reforms.</p>

  <p>Having made so much of the Party Conference, they could have brought up the national
  question there, but it was hardly the place for it. The first secretary of the
  Azerbaijan Central Committee in his talk mentioned the existence of the Soviet of
  Nationalities, which is the constitutional arm of the government where the resolution
  of this problem properly belongs. If not done there, he said, they should at least set
  up a commission or a sub-unit of the government to establish an ethnic ministry.
  Properly, this question should be taken up at a full-scale meeting of the Soviet of
  Nationalities. Of course, this could lead to an explosive discussion. But isn't it
  preferable to have an explosion within the confines of a constitutional arm of the
  government rather than in the streets?</p>

  <p>When the struggle was confined to the Armenians and Azerbaijanis, it might have been
  manageable with enough foresight and sensitivity. But there was hesitation and an
  under-estimation of the problem. Under these circumstances, it was utterly inevitable
  that larger, more formidable forces would enter the arena. The imperialists were very
  quick, at the first outbreak of the disorders in Azerbaijan and Armenia, to set up
  facilities in Rome and in the U.S. to process Armenian applications for immigration.
  How different it is for Haitian, Guatemalan and Salvadoran refugees!</p>

  <p>And then came Andrei Sakharov's open call for support to Armenia. It was an attempt
  to rally all the old Great Russian chauvinists, all the bourgeois and anti-communist
  elements. Sakharov has been legitimized as the leader of the bourgeois wing of the
  Gorbachev regime; he has gotten back on the governing board of the Soviet Academy of
  Sciences; he is a spokesperson on human rights for the bourgeois elements; and now he
  is promoting Armenian bourgeois elements. What once might have lent itself to an easier
  solution has now become a larger and more formidable struggle. All the chauvinists, all
  the bourgeois elements, are now gravitating toward Armenia.</p>

  <p>In the light of what was happening in the southern republics, it is interesting to
  note that the Estonian delegation came to the June Party Conference with a ready-made
  "popular front." The older communists might have thought, well, here was something
  progressive. Perhaps it reminded them of the working class struggles of the 1930s,
  particularly the anti-fascist front in France. But they might have looked closer at
  that, since even the Popular Front in France was a coalition between the working class
  parties and the Radical Socialists, who were the authentic party of the French
  bourgeoisie at that time. And it was led by the Premier, Edouard Daladier, who soon
  made short shrift of his anti-fascist demagogy and became the signer, along with
  Britain's Neville Chamberlain, of the Munich Pact with Hitler.</p>

  <p>But never mind that. It's all ancient history. This "popular front" from Estonia
  must be a good thing. Oh, sure it is. It is a provisional regime for the restoration of
  bourgeois private property and for an alliance with the imperialist bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Is this "popular front," complete with its own cabinet and a near-unanimous
  legislature, just a home-made product? Or is it an embryo bourgeois government, so
  ill-disguised that any communist in the USSR should be able to recognize it immediately
  and treat it as such? The attempt to set it up as an independent government is a farce
  and a fraud.</p>

  <p>All this was completely lost in the euphoria of self-congratulations over this great
  Conference. Now, however, Gorbachev has some second thoughts about Estonia and the
  "popular front." But this is November, not the halcyon days of June and July. So now,
  at a meeting of the Presidium of the Central Committee, he is obliged to remind the
  Baltic leadership that perestroika was meant to develop socialist property and not
  private property. The latter, says Gorbachev, leads to the "exploitation of man by
  man." <sup><a href="#1.">1</a></sup> Does the working class of the USSR need to be
  reminded of this, or is it his particular grouping of "innovators and experimenters"
  who have to relearn the basics? "Our revolution," he said, "was staged for the purpose
  ... of turning everything over to the people. The attempt to restore private property
  means a move backwards and is a deeply erroneous decision." <sup><a href=
  "#2.">2</a></sup> Well, well.</p>

  <p>However welcome this reassertion of fundamental principles is, it is important to
  know that what the leaders of the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) have
  raised is not the validity or applicability of the Russian Revolution, but the
  annexation and incorporation of the Baltic states into the USSR in 1939.</p>

  <p>We have written about the history of this region before.<sup><a href=
  "#3.">3</a></sup> In brief, when the Baltic states were part of the czarist empire in
  1917, an attempt was made by the workers to overthrow the bourgeois governments there
  simultaneously with the Russian Revolution. But they failed and then the German
  imperialists took over the area and occupied it. After the German defeat, the Baltic
  states were declared independent by the victorious Allies. Some of the comrades thought
  the right thing to do was to move in the Red Army and take over that territory again.
  But wiser counsel, led by Lenin, overruled this with the view that, given time, the
  workers of the Baltic states would rise to the historic occasion and overturn the
  landed barons and the German bourgeoisie who controlled the vital industrial arteries
  of the region.</p>

  <p>Instead of allowing the free development of democratic processes, the bourgeoisie in
  the Baltics generally began to repress the workers' movement. The bourgeoisie in
  Estonia proved so weak and unstable, however, that it experienced 20 coalition
  governments before it succumbed to a near-fascist regime, which lasted until the Red
  Army arrived in 1939. The Soviet Union had just signed a non-aggression pact with
  Germany &ndash; but only after it tried and failed to get an agreement with Britain
  banning direct or indirect aggression by Nazi Germany in the area. Faced with the
  imminent possibility of pro-Nazi coups in the Baltic states, the USSR instead made an
  agreement with Germany that allowed it to send its troops into the area. Within two
  years, Germany attacked the USSR, occupying the Baltic states once again. It remained
  for the Red Army to free these states from Nazi occupation. They were won in a war of
  socialism against imperialism, and this cannot be negotiated away.</p>

  <p>Why is the Gorbachev regime on the defensive on this? It's part and parcel of the
  accommodation with U.S. and European imperialism. It's not that they're afraid of the
  Estonian bourgeoisie &ndash; they're afraid of bourgeois public opinion in the
  imperialist countries, who are presenting the spectre of another Czechoslovakia.</p>

  <p>These states were won in an international civil war, far more significant
  historically and as binding as was the victory of the North over the South in the
  bloody U.S. Civil War. The war was the final arbiter and this should have been made
  clear from the very beginning to Washington, to Bonn and to the Nordic satellites of
  imperialism.</p>

  <p>The Estonians would never have the brashness, the insolence to come with an embryo
  so-called independent government and ask for recognition unless they were supported and
  instigated by the imperialist bourgeoisie and had been fed steadily with bourgeois
  economic concessions by the Gorbachev administration. But it's not too late. A
  turnaround has to be made by the Soviet government if it is to avoid the disintegrating
  effects of the growth of bourgeois nationalism as against communist working class
  solidarity.</p>
