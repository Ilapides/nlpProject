  <h2>The structure of the Soviet state</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>How imperialists switched tactics in regard to Soviet nationalities. Planned
    economy requires voluntary association of equal nations. Lenin's preoccupation with
    setting up a state structure to conform to this. Transition from Congress of Soviets
    to union of equal republics. The USSR's bicameral system and the Soviet of
    Nationalities. U.S. "democracy" and the case of Puerto Rico. Self-determination,
    including the right of secession, part of Soviet constitution. Relation between
    planning and national sovereignty, centralism and regional authority. Need to
    harmonize these contradictory forces through democratic centralism.</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The attitude of the ruling classes of the capitalist countries with regard
  to the national question in Russia underwent an extraordinary change when the Bolshevik
  Revolution triumphed in 1917. At first the international bourgeoisie attempted to
  malign the new republic by proclaiming that the revolutionary leaders, in particular
  the members of the Executive Committee of the Soviets, were not really representative
  of Russia. Dzerzhinsky was a Pole, Stalin was a Georgian, Trotsky was a Jew, other
  leaders were Ukrainian, Armenian and so on. It was the same tactic they used to bait
  communists in this country when the left movement had many members and leaders who were
  Jewish, Black or foreign-born.</p>

  <p>However, as the Revolution progressed, and as Soviet power took hold over larger and
  larger sections of the country, sweeping all the provinces and nationalities within its
  fold, it became clear that it was an all-national revolution. The international
  bourgeoisie thereafter took another tack and began to malign the USSR in a new way. Now
  it was said that the Great-Russians were oppressing all the other nationalities.</p>

  <p>Next came a long silence about the revolutionary role of the formerly oppressed
  nationalities in the formation of the Soviet Union and particularly in the Bolshevik
  leadership. Researchers in the recent period seem to have had difficulty finding out
  what role, if any, the formerly oppressed peoples had in the Bolshevik Revolution. This
  tendentiousness of the imperialist bourgeoisie and their silence on the role of
  oppressed nationalities in the Bolshevik Revolution finally attracted the attention of
  at least one researcher, Andrew Ezergailis, who felt impelled to write a book about
  it.<sup><a href="#1.">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>This book does more than just describe the role of the Latvians in their own
  revolution. It puts forth the view that a division of Latvian soldiers not only aided
  the Bolshevik Revolution and won significant battles, such as the Battle of Rostov, the
  Battle of Archangel and the Battle of Rogachov, but it virtually saved the Soviet
  Republic from a counterrevolutionary insurrection in Petrograd in 1918. Even if one
  regards this view  &ndash;  that one division saved the republic  &ndash;  as somewhat far-fetched, his
  book nevertheless has the great merit of putting before the U.S. public the
  revolutionary role of at least one of the constituent republics of the USSR. This could
  interest the reader to see how many other republics were formidable pillars in erecting
  and sustaining the Soviet Union, not only in its early days but also in the Second
  World War.</p>

  <p>If it is true that the construction of a socialist society is impossible without a
  planned economy, it is equally true that a planned economy is impossible in a
  multinational country without the equality of all the nations and their free, voluntary
  association within the framework of a union of all the socialist republics. It was
  precisely to this question that Lenin devoted the last days of his life. How could the
  interests of a planned economy be reconciled with the apparently contradictory need for
  the equality of all the nationalities in the USSR? What kind of a state structure
  should be developed to give full vent to the workers and peasants and conform to the
  revolutionary reconstitution of Soviet society as it emerged from the overthrow of the
  czarist autocracy and the sweeping away of the bourgeoisie and the landlords?</p>

  <p>At first, the Bolsheviks raised the slogan, "All power to the Soviets!" And, indeed,
  power was fully taken by the First Congress of the Soviets of Workers, Peasants and
  Soldiers Deputies. When the Congress of Soviets was not in session, the Executive
  Committee of the Soviets carried out the functions of the Congress.</p>

  <p>In 1918 this slogan was translated into the celebrated decree, the "Declaration of
  Rights of the Working and Exploited People," <sup><a href="#2.">2</a></sup> which
  embodied the fundamental state program and structure of the USSR. The leading
  ideological and political role taken by the Communist Party was the central factor in
  making the Soviets a living reflection of the interests of the exploited and oppressed
  masses of Russia.</p>

  <p>While the Congress of Soviets was revolutionary in form as well as in content, it
  still had some inadequacies. The problem of how to perfect the state structure covered
  many weeks and months of discussion, both during the periods of relative peace as well
  as during the war of imperialist intervention and the civil war. It was not until
  1922-23 that the new structure of the USSR was to emerge, after intense if not heated
  discussions. This structure was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and it differs
  from that of any capitalist government in two fundamental ways.</p>

  <p>In the first place, it is based not on the landlords and capitalists, not on the
  existence of private property in the means of production, not on wage labor employed by
  private enterprise, but on a new social system where the means of production are
  socially owned and the economy is planned. Bourgeois politicians, ideologues and
  philosophers will accede to that much, at least in the formal sense, although they
  completely deny the validity of socialism or go on to exaggerate its defects and
  shortcomings to the extent that the USSR is depicted as totally devoid of any
  significant progressive social and political features.</p>

  <p>There is another feature of the state structure of the USSR which is just as
  fundamental, yet the bourgeois ideologues and their myriads of apologists and
  historians rarely refer to it. It is even neglected in much of the progressive and
  radical literature of the workers' movement. To understand this second feature, it
  would be helpful to first look at the innumerable capitalist state structures, whether
  their form be democratic, monarchical, military or even fascist.</p>

  <p>The most democratic form of the capitalist state may be unicameral, that is, having
  one body which enacts all legislation, plus an executive arm of the government. Or, as
  in the United States, it can have two legislative bodies, such as the House of
  Representatives and the Senate. However, not one of the capitalist governments,
  whatever its constitution may be, has an arm built into the framework of the state to
  deal with the national question and make sure that the nationalities within the country
  are represented in all important decisions. There may be references in the constitution
  to equal protection of the law, due process, and so on. There may be special
  legislation regarding civil rights. There may be this or that agency dealing with
  complaints or enforcement. But there is no specific arm within the constitutional
  structure of any capitalist state which deals specifically with the question of
  nationalities. This differentiates the USSR from all the capitalist countries.</p>

  <p>From the point of view of its external characteristics, the USSR has this in common
  with some of the capitalist states: it has a bicameral system. In this sense, it seems
  like the U.S., but the two arms of its legislative structure are very different from
  the two houses of Congress here.</p>

  <p>This bicameral system is found in the highest governing body, the Supreme Soviet of
  the USSR, which consists of the Soviet of the Union and the <strong>Soviet of
  Nationalities</strong>. The Soviet of the Union is chosen on the basis of proportional
  representation  &ndash;  each deputy represents an equal amount of people. In the Soviet of
  Nationalities, each nationality is guaranteed a set number of deputies. The members of
  both chambers serve equal terms, and no bill can become law unless adopted by a
  majority of both chambers. This all-important second arm is of extraordinary
  significance, particularly in the epoch of imperialism, in which national oppression is
  a characteristic feature. It is the kind of structure which, if incorporated into a
  bourgeois state, would tremendously assist the struggle of the oppressed nationalities
  against the dominant nationality.</p>

  <p>In constructing this mechanism for governing, the Soviet Union accorded recognition
  to the existence of nationalities in a revolutionary way which had never been done
  before. It created an equality between the two chambers, one based on representation
  according to the proportion of the population, the other on guaranteed representation
  for every nationality. In this way, not only the general interests of the working class
  are reflected, but also the very special and important interests of all
  nationalities.</p>

  <p>These structures are defined under the Constitution of the USSR. Chapter XV, Article
  109 says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">The Supreme Soviet of the USSR shall consist of two chambers: the Soviet of the Union
    and the Soviet of Nationalities. The two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR
    shall have equal rights.<sup><a href="#3.">3</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Article 110 says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">The Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities shall have equal numbers of
    deputies. The Soviet of the Union shall be elected by constituencies with equal
    population. The Soviet of Nationalities shall be elected on the basis of the
    following representation: 32 deputies from each Union Republic, 11 deputies from each
    Autonomous Republic, five deputies from each Autonomous Region, and one deputy from
    each Autonomous Area.<sup><a href="#4.">4</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The voting age in the USSR is 18, and was so long before it was ever
  lowered here. Of course, voting there is irrespective of race, nationality, religion,
  gender and property rights.</p>

  <p>It should be remembered that the U.S. Constitution, while it contained no language
  about qualifications for voting, allowed the states to limit voting to the landowners,
  bankers, merchants and capitalists. Only property owners could vote. Women, Black and
  Native people and indentured servants were all deprived of the right to vote. And even
  after many of these restrictions were lifted, there were poll taxes, literacy
  requirements and complicated registration forms. Women got the right to vote only in
  1919, and the Equal Rights Amendment has still not been adopted to this very day.</p>

  <p>In addition to according universal suffrage, the Soviet Constitution gives greater
  representation to the various nationalities, making it possible for even the smallest
  of the republics to have additional leverage over and above its proportion in the
  population. The Soviet of Nationalities was designed to overcome the predominance of
  the large nations and give additional weight to the smaller ones.</p>

  <p>Is there a constitution anywhere in the bourgeois world that even bears a
  resemblance to such an effort as that incorporated in the Soviet state structure? The
  significance of the chamber of nationalities is completely overlooked elsewhere,
  precisely because of the racist and chauvinist character of the imperialist
  countries.</p>

  <p>When in July 1988 the Democratic Convention nominated Dukakis and Bentsen, there was
  a great deal of oratory on prime-time television and the capitalist media boasted about
  how democratically the meeting was conducted. But completely unnoticed was that while
  there was a delegation from Puerto Rico participating in the "democratic process," the
  people of Puerto Rico have no representation in the Congress of the U.S. Would even one
  politician get up and object to the fact that the people of Puerto Rico, even though
  they are considered citizens and are subject to be drafted into the U.S. Army, cannot
  vote in congressional elections? Nor are they allowed to secede and declare themselves
  an independent republic. The same could be said for Samoa and Guam.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the vigorous support of a whole host of countries, a resolution
  supporting the self-determination of Puerto Rico has been pigeonholed in the
  Decolonization Committee of the United Nations for years and years. The U.S. makes
  absolutely sure that it rarely sees the light of day, even though most of the countries
  in the UN regard Puerto Rico as a U.S. colony that should by right be independent.</p>

  <p>Of course, there is nothing in the U.S. Constitution or its amendments on the right
  of nations to self-determination. The USSR, on the other hand, has a specific
  constitutional provision which not only guarantees the right of its constituent nations
  to self-determination, but also specifies the unequivocal right to secede. Thus, in
  considering the national question in the USSR, it is very important to contrast it with
  the imperialist countries. The comparison shows the tremendous amount of progress made
  by the USSR and the truly revolutionary structure it has developed. It stands head and
  shoulders above any capitalist government.</p>

  <p>While a great deal of literature can be found describing the social character of the
  USSR, little of it deals with the structure of the state, particularly as it pertains
  to the Soviet of Nationalities, the arm which oppressed peoples throughout the world
  would be most concerned with. The English historian E.H. Carr, in his three-volume work
  on the USSR,<sup><a href="#5.">5</a></sup> went into considerable detail on the
  formation of the USSR and the union republics, but without illuminating the nature of
  the struggle within the USSR over the relationship of a planned economy to the equality
  of nations. Even where he does occasionally refer to the bicameral system of
  government, he never once mentions what a revolutionary departure this was.</p>

  <p>He had a good reason for avoiding any comparison with, say, the English system of
  parliamentary government. There he would have to refer to the existence of such an
  honorific cabinet post as the Colonial Secretary, the superintendent of imprisoned
  colonial peoples. Or, for that matter, the existence of the Prince of Wales, who is not
  a person from Wales but a member of the hereditary English bourgeois monarchy. Not to
  speak of Britain's role in Ireland.</p>

  <p>The objective of constructing the Soviet of Nationalities as one of the bicameral
  arms of the Soviet government was not to divide the nationalities but to strengthen
  proletarian class solidarity and to unite the mass of the people in the struggle for
  socialism on the basis of the equality of all nations.</p>

  <p>All this notwithstanding, it is especially important in light of the centrifugal
  forces of national sovereignty to consider the planning principles of a socialist
  country. How was it possible, for instance, to construct a five-year plan while
  guaranteeing the equality and sovereignty of the union republics, the autonomous
  republics, the autonomous regions and the national districts?</p>

  <p>One gets a measure of the problem if one considers the complexity of carrying out a
  vast, comprehensive plan of economic and industrial development on the basis of
  achieving the agreement of the various nationalities of the USSR. Of course, it is
  conceivable that it could all get done by administrative measures, while riding
  roughshod over the heads of the nationalities, that is, over the mass of the people.
  There are few historians or analysts of the USSR in the West who venture to explain the
  intricacies of achieving a five-year plan without the tumult, disorder and rebellion
  which would accompany a capitalist government's attempt to carry out a plan, were it to
  embark on one.</p>

  <p>The history of capitalist expansion in the U.S., for instance, shows that even the
  development of a transcontinental railroad was accompanied by the worst corruption and
  bribery, the use of virtual slave labor of Asian people, an onslaught against the
  Native peoples, and skullduggery in forcing or tricking independent small farmers to
  sell their land cheap. It's a history full of crime. Or what about opening up the
  criminal files held by the city of San Francisco in its famous indictment and ultimate
  conviction of General Motors? These show that, in order to expand automobile use on a
  national basis, GM tried to destroy San Francisco's trolley car system and other forms
  of transport in many other cities.</p>

  <p>For all the high-handed and command methods that were employed in the USSR,
  especially during the Stalin era, it nevertheless was a truly historic achievement that
  such widespread industrialization could be carried out at all in a country with over
  100 nationalities.</p>

  <p>At first, many of the territories held under the former czarist autocracy were
  amalgamated, so that in 1923 there were only four union republics. Today, however,
  there are 15 union republics, 20 autonomous republics, eight autonomous regions and ten
  national areas. What this signifies is the greater attention given to each nationality.
  Further demarcations, not only geographical but cultural, helped social as well as
  economic development.</p>

  <p>Genuine socialist construction, by its very nature, tends to unite not only the
  working class, not only the exploited masses, but the people of all nationalities. It
  must nevertheless be recognized that there is an inherent contradiction between the
  economic tasks of socialism, which demand centralization, and the needs of the
  nationalities to develop their culture, language, etc. on the basis of equality.</p>

  <p>It is for this very reason that the Soviet of Nationalities was constructed. It was
  conceived not as a ceremonial institution but as an effective and functioning one,
  where all the nationalities could express their needs and their aspirations more fully
  than in any other institution. However, there are significant defects and shortcomings
  in how all this has been carried out, which we have analyzed in our articles on
  Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and the Baltic republics.</p>

  <p>Perestroika, or restructuring, which General Secretary Gorbachev has characterized
  as a qualitative turn to rebuild the whole country, necessarily will affect the
  nationalities. The enormous restructuring envisioned calls for a vast scientific and
  technological revolution in the industrial structure of the USSR. Such a plan cannot be
  effectuated without the most scrupulous attention to the national question. As has been
  demonstrated, first by the Alma-Ata rebellion in Kazakhstan and later in Azerbaijan and
  Armenia, the economic reforms have influenced and encouraged the disorders. One might
  be tempted to ascribe this to the peculiarities of these republics, which historically
  were less developed. This, however, is a spurious argument and is totally without
  foundation. This is shown by the disorders in the Baltic republics  &ndash;  Lithuania, Latvia
  and Estonia  &ndash;  at the other end of the USSR, which historically have been more
  industrially and technologically advanced. In loosening centralized control of the
  economy, the restructuring has encouraged many national aspirations to surface, while
  at the same time giving a freer rein to bourgeois trends which accentuate privilege and
  inequality.</p>

  <p>We have shown that while the reforms are moving to decentralize the economy, there
  has been a tightening of the reins in terms of political control by the center over the
  nationalities. In Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Latvia, Party leaders were
  removed from their posts in a way that offended the sensibilities of these
  nationalities.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the fact that there are pro-imperialist tendencies in the Baltic
  states, all the more must their national rights be scrupulously observed.</p>

  <p>It must be noted that there is an inherent contradiction between the centripetal
  needs of socialist planning and the centrifugal forces contained in greater national
  sovereignty. These forces have to be harmonized and unified on the basis of socialist
  centralism in the economy and socialist democracy in the center's dealing with the
  nationalities. Of course, democratic centralism is an indispensable ingredient in all
  relationships in the USSR, but the area that needs particular sensitivity, and to which
  Lenin referred again and again, particularly during the last days of his life, is the
  national question.</p>

  <p>The historic significance of the 12th Congress of the Communist Party held in April
  1923 is that it recognized the necessity of a firm and continuing struggle against "the
  relics of great-power chauvinism" and urged a consistent struggle against the economic
  and cultural inequality of the nationalities within the Soviet Union. It also called
  for a struggle against the relics of nationalism of all kinds, but the emphasis was on
  eradicating the heavy legacy of czarist oppression. All this may be regarded as part of
  a history more than six decades old, decades of stupendous economic, social and
  political development. Nevertheless, certain aspects of the national question have to
  be reviewed in light of the contemporary situation. It is impossible to avoid the
  question if one is to take seriously the resolutions on restructuring of the 27th
  Congress of the CPSU and of the 19th Party Conference in June 1988.</p>
