  June 16, 1988</h5>

  <h2>The Makarov thesis</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>Makarov of Soviet Academy of Sciences comments on Hewett book on Soviet
    reforms. Doesn't challenge Hewett's views on Soviet agriculture. Why has growth rate
    of Soviet economy slowed down? The question of "equality" vs. "efficiency." Soviet
    prowess in space, oil drilling and other high technology. What social groups have
    become "indifferent"? Efforts to trim state apparatus. Do material incentives promote
    socialist construction? Not too much socialism, but too little. Equality must be
    increased. Makarov captured by euphoria over peaceful coexistence.</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In Moscow last week, even as the summit meeting between President Reagan
  and General Secretary Gorbachev was proceeding, it was partially eclipsed by a public
  discussion of the implementation of the Soviet economic reforms. This gives an idea of
  the intensity of the discussion and preparations being made in anticipation of the June
  27, 1988, Communist Party Conference, where all this will be brought up.</p>

  <p>With such political ferment on the eve of the Conference, one is eager for any
  direct information about the reforms, especially the economic restructuring, coming
  from authoritative Soviet sources. We therefore read with great interest a piece by
  V.L. Makarov, director of the Central Economic and Mathematical Institute of the Soviet
  Academy of Sciences, that appeared in the New York Times Book Review. Makarov's
  commentary concerns a recent book by Ed A. Hewett of the Brookings Institution in
  Washington entitled <em>Reforming the Soviet Economy.</em><sup><a href=
  "#1.">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Makarov's piece is disappointing, especially coming from somebody who
  holds such a prestigious office and who, needless to say, has direct information
  regarding the Soviet economy.</p>

  <p>Hewett belongs to one of the many think tanks in the U.S. that studies the Soviet
  Union. However, he takes a more moderate bourgeois imperialist view of the Soviet
  economy than most and is one of the proponents of live and let live, with his own
  variety of peaceful coexistence. Of course, to him peaceful coexistence is based on the
  Soviet economy moving "forward" to a modified form of capitalism. At any rate, Hewett
  sounds friendly and thus Makarov's handling of the book is also in the same spirit.</p>

  <p>Makarov lets Hewett off rather easy on some matters which are of more than passing
  interest. He doesn't mention, for instance, that Hewett, after saying there is little
  evidence the Soviet Union uses statistics to mislead the outside world, then adds that
  "There is ample evidence that when the regime does not like a number, it stops
  publishing it." Hewett adds in a footnote, "When, for example, the Soviet grain harvest
  fell dramatically in 1981, the Central Statistical Administration simply discontinued
  publication of those data, a policy continued through the 1985 data." <sup><a href=
  "#2.">2</a></sup> Considering that Makarov is the director of a major institute of the
  Soviet Academy of Sciences, it seems rather odd he should let this go unanswered.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Soviet Union has at various times stopped publishing certain data,
  and there is no denying that a great deal of information which the public is entitled
  to is now becoming more available. But the point that Hewett makes here is wholly
  misleading and aids the imperialist position on the USSR.</p>

  <p>Grain is a strategic weapon, as important as any save the nuclear ones. The USSR may
  even do well without some of its nuclear weapons, as the recent INF treaty shows, but
  it is extremely vulnerable to such catastrophic droughts as occurred in the 1960s.
  (Some credit the fall of Khrushchev to crop failures; Brezhnev, it is said, survived
  the early 1970s when a good harvest came to his rescue.)</p>

  <p>The USSR is a deficit country when it comes to agriculture. Its rainfall is very
  meager by comparison to the U.S. and its growing season much shorter. It is therefore
  obliged to buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of grain abroad, much of it from
  the U.S. So significant is the strategic aspect of grain that harvest figures are
  guarded almost as a military secret.</p>

  <p>The U.S. regularly monitors weather conditions in the USSR by satellite. It is said
  that when President Jimmy Carter decided to decree a vicious embargo on selling grain
  to the USSR, his decision was guided by the forecasts of the U.S. meteorological
  apparatus, which projected that the Soviet Union would be driven to desperation because
  of the agricultural situation. Carter was confident that it would quickly succumb to
  starvation. However, it was able to buy the needed grain from other producing countries
  and the embargo was felt most by U.S. farmers.</p>

  <p>Long-term crop forecasts prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture are highly
  guarded and kept under lock and key until their disclosure. This is all done with an
  eye to world market conditions. The predictions affect the futures prices of
  agriculture products, which are traded in the hundreds of millions of dollars
  hourly.</p>

  <p>So when the USSR in 1981 stopped publishing grain statistics, it wasn't because it
  was a closed society as such. It was for important strategic reasons, because food is a
  weapon. When the harvests are good and abundant, there is no need for such secrecy. The
  grain statistics began to be published again in 1986, but not only as a measure of
  openness and democratization. The situation in the USSR with respect to agriculture has
  eased in the last several years, both because of economic and weather conditions.</p>

  <p>Also to be taken into account here is the Challenger. It carried a very important
  spy satellite that had the newest meteorological and technological equipment for
  forecasting the weather. Its destruction has made it incumbent on the U.S. to employ
  foreign satellites for such purposes. Makarov, who alludes to the Soviet Union as a
  closed society, says nothing to dispute the so-called openness of U.S. imperialism.</p>

  <p>One of the most important questions facing the Party Conference relates to the rate
  of growth of the Soviet economy. It is admitted by all the groupings that it has slowed
  down. The question is why? Makarov addresses the question of the growth rate of the
  Soviet Union.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">From 1928 to 1955 the rate of growth of the Soviet economy was relatively high
    (between 5 and 10 percent a year) and during that time the Soviet Union became the
    second greatest power in the world from an economic point of view. At the same time
    there were marked advances in the social and economic lives of people; they could be
    assured of economic security, full employment, certainty about income levels. It
    seemed to us that we had achieved everything we could desire.<br /><br />

    But there was a weakening of the factors that contribute to long-run economic
    growth. During the last 15 or 20 years the rate of growth slowed down steadily; the
    quality and variety of consumer goods deteriorated; people became increasingly
    indifferent to political and economic life and there were fewer incentives for them
    to work hard or become involved in difficult initiatives. That was also a period when
    information was becoming rapidly available through the growth of modern
    communications. People in the Soviet Union became much more aware of conditions in
    the rest of the world and it was no longer possible to maintain the closed position
    of Soviet society. As Mister Gorbachev has said, this was a precrisis and
    prerevolutionary situation.<sup><a href="#3.">3</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>With all due respect to the high post Makarov holds, this answer is an
  amalgam of complete rubbish. It will not withstand the light of history and will be
  challenged. It's an echo of what the imperialist press is saying, that the Soviet
  people are finally learning of the glories of capitalist exploitation and imperialist
  oppression. The era of telecommunications is finally enlightening the Soviet people and
  opening up the closed society. Incredible as it seems, this comes from an official at
  the prestigious Soviet Academy of Sciences.</p>

  <p>Indeed, this confirms what the so-called conservatives in the USSR are saying about
  a good many of the leading exponents of the reforms: that they are influenced by "the
  preaching of the `democratic' charms of present-day capitalism and fawning over its
  achievements, real and imagined." (From the letter to Sovetskaya Rossiya known as the
  Andreyeva manifesto, analyzed in our last article.)</p>

  <p>Moscow News referred to another document of the so-called conservatives, a
  typewritten piece called "Information for Reflection" that is circulating hand to hand.
  It argues that perestroika will first lead to "economic disaster and social upheaval,
  and then to the country's enslavement by imperialist states." <sup><a href=
  "#4.">4</a></sup> The views put forward by Professor Makarov can hardly reassure this
  current.</p>

  <p>But to get back to the slowing in the rate of growth. Makarov neglects to note,
  especially when he is addressing a foreign audience, that it is only the
  <strong>rate</strong> of growth that has declined. There has not been an overall
  decline in the economy. The gross national product has continued to increase. In other
  words, the Soviet Union ever since the first five-year plan has not once experienced
  one of those declines or wholesale collapses of the economy, with its consequent
  unemployment, that is so characteristic of capitalist production. Now with the
  high-tech revolution, unemployment continues to grow in capitalist society even in the
  best of times.</p>

  <p>Another point to be borne in mind when discussing the rate of growth is that, just
  as it takes much longer to turn around an ocean liner than a small tugboat, it takes
  longer to expedite the growth rate in a developed economy, especially one that has
  received so many jolts from war, intervention and deliberate economic isolation by the
  imperialists.</p>

  <p>Makarov does not directly respond to the basic thesis raised in Hewett's book,
  summarized by its subtitle: "Equality Versus Efficiency." The socialist system is
  inefficient, he says, because its objective is communist equality. Hewett's thesis is
  that the slow growth in the last period, the so-called stagnation, arises from systemic
  factors, factors inherent in a planned, socialist economy.</p>

  <p>Makarov does not explain why some aspects of the Soviet economy have performed so
  splendidly while others have not. For instance, Hewett admits that the Soviet economy
  "produces a titanium-hulled alpha-class submarine that goes faster and deeper than any
  submarine in the world. It has also managed to build," he further concedes, "one of the
  world's largest natural gas distribution systems by relying primarily on domestically
  produced compressors and turbines and all of this realized ahead of schedule despite
  the U.S. administration's best efforts to delay construction." <sup><a href=
  "#5.">5</a></sup> Hewett is of course referring here to the Reagan administration's
  desperate attempt to intimidate Western European countries from either buying gas from
  the USSR or supplying materials to construct the pipeline, which was successfully built
  anyhow and is now in full operation.</p>

  <p>"With its own technology," he goes on, "the Soviet Union has sent remote-operated
  machinery to the moon, established and maintained a working space station, drilled the
  deepest oil wells in the world, and developed a technology for producing continuous
  cast aluminum that the U.S. defense contractors have purchased." Isn't that
  interesting! "More important," he says, "over the last quarter of a century it has
  moved from a position of distinct strategic inferiority vis-a-vis the U.S. to one of at
  least parity, if not superiority." <sup><a href="#6.">6</a></sup></p>

  <p>The fact that the Reagan administration, for all its bombast, threats and
  trillion-dollar defense expenditures, has been obligated to sign an INF treaty with the
  USSR, whatever else it may or may not mean, denotes a significant moderation at least
  in posture. It is clear that the USSR has been able to make spectacular advances in
  space science, military technology and other significant scientific and technological
  fields. So the question remains, why is there a slowing down of the growth rate?</p>

  <p>One reason advanced by Makarov is that people became increasingly indifferent to
  political and economic life. But why would that be so? Why become indifferent to an
  economic system that was providing them with economic security, well-being,
  opportunities for education, as he himself admits? Has there in fact been a development
  of indifference? What are its political and social roots? Is it the working class that
  has become indifferent, or is it the upper stratum of the bourgeois intelligentsia?</p>

  <p>Suddenly, according to Makarov, there are fewer incentives for people to work hard
  or become involved in difficult initiatives. Is that really so? The building of the gas
  pipeline, at such a rapid pace and under conditions of U.S. imperialist hostility and
  obstruction  &ndash;  wasn't that a difficult initiative? And didn't it succeed?</p>

  <p>Is he saying, like some of the neobourgeois economists in the USSR, the Shmelyovs
  and their ilk, that the working class has become lazy, indolent, etc., and therefore
  economic mechanisms should be employed that bring about unemployment to intimidate the
  workers?</p>

  <p>What is actually at stake in all of this is the alleged problem of the erosion of
  socialist initiative and socialist cooperation as against bourgeois individual
  acquisitiveness. Yet no one in the Soviet Union has yet demonstrated that this really
  is the problem, that the working class has lost interest in socialist cooperation and
  socialist initiative and that it is their craving for greater material incentives in an
  individualistic, competitive way that has to be encouraged.</p>

  <p>In fact, material incentives have been vigorously pushed, not just in recent times
  but beginning as far back as the Stalin period and the Stakhanovite campaign,
  particularly in the early 1930s. There have been several significant reforms during the
  period of slower growth Makarov alludes to since 1955 which steadily increased material
  incentives. The first was during the Khrushchev administration in 1957, and lasted
  until 1964. There were further reforms under Alexei N. Kosygin and under Brezhnev in
  1973 and 1979. All of this restructuring also included material incentives for the
  purpose of raising the efficiency of the Soviet economy. There is no evidence whatever
  that Gorbachev at any time disapproved of them or indicated their inadequacy or
  insufficiency.</p>

  <p>These reforms can be divided into several categories. Some are more important than
  others. Of course, any reform which reduces the heavy weight of the state apparatus and
  facilitates the growth of the economy is progressive. For instance, one of the first
  attempts at reform of the state apparatus was under the Khrushchev administration. He
  attempted to cut down the various government ministries. Instead of having them all
  centralized in Moscow, he tried to break them up into regional groupings in an effort
  to bring them, as was thought at the time, closer to the people. Unfortunately, this
  failed its objective. He divided them into agricultural and industrial groupings, which
  later proved to be unworkable and had to be abolished. There have been subsequent
  efforts to cut down the administrative staffs of the government, but they have
  nonetheless grown.</p>

  <p>The real issue is whether material incentives are an effective means in a socialist
  economy for raising the level of productivity and the general living standards. Or do
  they aid the growth of social inequality, create a deterrent to socialist cooperation
  in the working class and restrain and limit socialist solidarity? Are they a turn back
  toward bourgeois norms of production?</p>

  <p>Of course, under the first stage of socialism, work is from each according to one's
  ability and wages are to each according to one's work, and not according to one's
  needs, as is the goal of communism. This is precisely the question raised by Hewett.
  His thesis, and that of almost all other bourgeois economists, is that the various
  economic reforms which have had a decentralizing effect on the Soviet economy are
  welcome but they don't go far enough. <strong>What they want is a wholesale rejection
  of socialist planning and the abandonment of the ownership of the means of production
  by the working class.</strong></p>

  <p>A certain amount of social inequality is absolutely unavoidable in the first stages
  of socialist construction, as in the period immediately after a socialist revolution.
  But the real issue here is what is the perspective, how is it revealed in the various
  plans constructed for the building up of the economy? Are these plans drawn up with a
  view to overcoming social inequality and moving onward to the higher stage of
  communism?</p>

  <p>If the economy gets bogged down in a multitude of ill-considered schemes,
  adventures, poor planning and bureaucracy and a mire of so-called short-term
  strategies, these actually have the tendency to disqualify socialist planning and the
  perspective of socialist equality, as has happened over a period of several decades  &ndash; 
  not counting the rigid, over-centralized and repressive system of the earlier days.
  This is basically the problem.</p>

  <p>Is the solution to go backward to a market-oriented economy? The Soviet Union
  deliberately took a big step back with the New Economic Policy of the 1920s, but that
  was before there had been any socialist planning. It was necessary in order to get the
  economy going again after the civil war and intervention, but by 1929 the first
  five-year plan superseded the NEP.</p>

  <p>The problem is not that the Soviet Union suffers from excessive socialism. It is
  that the Soviet Union in many respects is barely a semi-socialist state. The collective
  farms are not socialist, they are only semi-socialist, as is a vast sector of the
  so-called service or secondary economy. A good part of the Soviet economy is still
  based on commodity relationships. It needs to advance from that toward socialism, not
  go back to bourgeois market relations. Unfortunately, that is what is being proposed by
  the neobourgeois economists and also by some in the government.</p>

  <p>The principal contradiction in the Soviet economy up until now was not that the
  productive forces had outgrown the socialized property forms, but that the productive
  forces were too low for socialist organization, so low they could scarcely accommodate
  the livelihood of the masses. But now the productive forces have become formidable. The
  contradiction that has arisen out of their dynamic growth is not to the socialist forms
  of property but to the semi-socialist character of social relations. Social relations
  have not advanced commensurate with the tremendous scientific and technological
  capabilities of the productive forces.</p>

  <p>This is what has to be brought home. The character of social relations in the USSR
  is still far from being socialist. In order for the productive forces to advance
  further, it is necessary to promote greater socialization of the USSR. But what has
  really happened, which may account for the slowdown in the growth rate, is that a
  reservoir of bourgeois social norms in income and in social relations generally has
  developed.</p>

  <p>Instead of attacking bourgeois norms, the leadership is attacking egalitarianism,
  "to each according to one's need," even though that is still in the future. Many
  workers feel they're not even getting "to each according to one's work," under present
  circumstances. Hence, this last formula still has a certain appeal.</p>

  <p>The level of equality must be raised, not just as far as wages go, but in so many
  fields: abolish the inequality that exists between town and country, between one city
  or region and another, between the entire hierarchy, intelligentsia and bureaucracy, on
  the one hand, and the least paid among the workers.</p>

  <p>If one is to talk in terms of economic stagnation, a certain amount of it certainly
  comes from bureaucratic inertia and high-handedness, which shouldn't be underestimated.
  But much more significant are the social privileges which create such a wide chasm
  between the governing stratum of the USSR and the masses.</p>

  <p>Suffice it to say that Makarov's thesis is completely in line with not only some of
  the neobourgeois economists in the Soviet Union but with Hewett's thesis as well.
  Makarov says, in concluding his article, "As Mr. Hewett says, `The consequences of
  economic reform for the Soviet Union are also consequences for the rest of the world. A
  successful reform and a revitalization of the Soviet economy could drastically change
  the economic relationship between the Soviet Union and the West, with benefits to both
  sides.' " <sup><a href="#7.">7</a></sup></p>

  <p>This totally disregards the world situation as it has existed ever since the great
  October socialist revolution, and is a product of the euphoria created by the so-called
  detente with the Reagan administration and the signing of the INF treaty on June 1,
  1988. Peaceful coexistence, even in its best times, has meant nothing more than a
  change in the form of the class war between two social systems that are based on
  diametrically opposed classes. If Makarov and some others captured by the present
  euphoric moment forget this, the Pentagon certainly has not. Secretary of Defense Frank
  Carlucci was quick to remind the NATO allies of this, as reported in an article
  headlined, "Carlucci Warns the West Not to Relax with Moscow; Secretary Wary of Aiding
  Soviet Economy." <sup><a href="#8.">8</a></sup></p>

  <p>The picture Carlucci paints is in very different colors than that of Hewett, who
  argues that the economic changes could benefit both the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
  Carlucci is said to have warned that the USSR's social and economic restructuring could
  ultimately make it a greater threat to the imperialists. "If the end result is that the
  Soviet Union modernizes its industrial and technological base and if some time in the
  1990s it ends up as a society that can produce enormous quantities of weapons even more
  effectively than it does today, then we will have made an enormous miscalculation."</p>

  <p>What Carlucci is saying is that regardless of these reforms, they don't go far
  enough. Not even an overturn of the social relations in the USSR would suffice to
  quench the imperialist appetites, which hunger for super-profits and military
  adventures.</p>

  <p>After reading Makarov's review, one has to think hard about whether he is a friend
  or a foe of the socialist Soviet Union.</p>
