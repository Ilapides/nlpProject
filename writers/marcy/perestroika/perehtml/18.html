  <h5>Article 18<br />
  October 13, 1988</h5>

  <h2>The shift in the party leadership</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>September 1988 Central Committee meeting admits economic reforms are bogged
    down, national struggles becoming sharper. No open political debate. Instead, shifts
    in top Party personnel. Gorbachev moves toward decollectivizing farms through
    contract work and long-term leases to land. Ligachev's role as head of agriculture.
    Need for open voting on resolutions. Neglect of national question. Soviet of
    Nationalities not consulted on Armenia and Azerbaijan. National question becomes
    political football to attack "conservatives."</strong>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>When the Central Committee of the Communist Party met for its fall session
  in late September 1988, it was faced with two truly staggering issues. One was how to
  proceed or possibly even whether to proceed with the Gorbachev economic reforms. As
  Gorbachev himself admitted in a speech to Soviet editors,<sup><a href="#1.">1</a></sup>
  the reforms are going slowly and in effect have stopped. "We are going slowly, we are
  losing time, this means we are losing the game. In a word, it turns out there is a gap
  between our goals and our work," he said. Viewing this prognosis in light of his
  October 15, 1985, report to the Central Committee, one cannot help but feel a sense of
  disappointment. He said at that time:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">It is planned in the next fifteen years to create an economic potential approximately
    equal in scale to that accumulated throughout all the previous years of Soviet
    government and to almost double national income and industrial output. Productivity
    of labor is to go up by 130-150 percent.<br /><br />

    This will help double the volume of resources for meeting the requirements of the
    people. I think that the document being presented gives us every ground for saying
    that the implementation of its social program will make it possible, in the next
    three five-year plan periods, to raise the Soviet people's standard of living to a
    qualitatively new level.<sup><a href="#2.">2</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Now, in September 1988, this grandiose panorama of what would happen over
  the next 15 years must be scaled down.</p>

  <p>By contrast, it is sure to be pointed out by some in the Central Committee that
  after the Soviet Union inaugurated the first Five-Year Plan, it took on such momentum
  that Stalin could assert the completion of the plan in four years. A comparison is
  surely being made in some of the leading circles of the USSR between pyatiletka (the
  name given the first Five-Year Plan) and perestroika. There are, of course, vast
  differences. They reflect two different epochs. The historical circumstances are
  altogether different. But both do involve technological as well as social and economic
  changes.</p>

  <p>The other critical question is the nationality issue. It has become more and more
  urgent as unrest and disorders have accelerated. No sooner had the Central Committee
  adjourned than once again the Baltic situation took on an ominous character with larger
  and more defiant demonstrations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</p>

  <p>These were the two issues that should have been dealt with. However, in the true
  spirit of a classic centrist, Gorbachev decided to shelve them and deal first with
  personnel changes. While they undoubtedly are urgent, and it is proper for the Central
  Committee to deal with them, under the circumstances it is really putting the cart
  before the horse.</p>

  <p>Usually the Party Congress elects the Central Committee, which then elects its
  executive committee (Politburo) and the other leading bodies. The form of the election
  can vary, but the Party Congress is the highest body. It would be in the tradition of
  Leninist democratic centralism for the Central Committee to first discuss the broad
  political issues, based on debate over the various resolutions, followed by voting for
  and against them. Then the last item on the agenda, as was done at Congresses during
  the Leninist period, would be to deal with the election of a new Politburo and its
  leadership. At the end it is possible to have a consensus even where there are serious
  differences of opinion. But these should be clearly stated without fear or favor.</p>

  <p>However, the old pattern of endless unanimous resolutions adopted without
  discernible differences (except those that are detected by reading between the lines or
  careful followup of the speeches and activities of the leadership) is still being
  followed, notwithstanding the standard denunciations of conservatism and stagnation
  &ndash; allusions to the Stalin and Brezhnev periods. This must now be recognized
  following the 19th Party Conference<sup><a href="#3.">3</a></sup> as well as the recent
  plenum of the Central Committee.<sup><a href="#4.">4</a></sup></p>

  <p>The bourgeois press was of course filled with speculation and inside dope on the
  meaning of the personnel changes. Unquestionably some of the media here have either
  direct or indirect access to explanations for the changes. One reported change in the
  structure of the Central Committee was to replace 22 departments with six commissions.
  Mikhail Gorbachev took Andrei Gromyko's seat as Chairman of the Presidium of the
  Supreme Soviet, also known as President. Gromyko, along with three others, was dropped
  from the Politburo. Gromyko has held ranking positions in the Party for 50 years and
  was foreign minister for 28 of them.</p>

  <p>Among the four new Politburo members are Gorbachev proteges Anatoly Lukyanov and
  Vadim Medvedev. Medvedev skipped over the candidate stage to be made a full member. He
  will be a Party secretary and will head the commission on ideology, replacing Yegor
  Ligachev, who previously had responsibility for both ideology and foreign policy.
  Ligachev will head the commission on agriculture.</p>

  <p>Anatoly Dobrynin, who held a position as senior foreign policy adviser to Gorbachev
  and was the longtime Soviet ambassador to the U.S., was replaced by Aleksandr Yakovlev,
  who will head the commission on international affairs. Yakovlev is considered to be one
  of Gorbachev's closest collaborators.</p>

  <p>The capitalist press has regarded Yegor Ligachev as second in command and the
  leading "conservative" in the Party. Medvedev, who replaces him, was previously the
  Party's senior adviser on Eastern Europe and has risen rapidly in the Party ranks since
  Gorbachev's accession in 1985. Yakovlev, who was put in Dobrynin's place, is regarded
  as very close to Gorbachev. It was he who gave the press a summary of Gorbachev's
  report to the 19th Party Conference.</p>

  <p>In response to a question from the Associated Press ("When do you think there will
  be an end to rationing of basic food in the Soviet Union?"), Yakovlev answered:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">It is bitter for me to hear and respond to this question because it is true, because
    this is our illness, this is our sore point. Yes, it is necessary to introduce as
    soon as possible lease contracting, brigade contracting, agro-firms, agro-combines
    and all the other things outlined recently in the context of agrarian policy. Yes, it
    is necessary to solve the food problem as soon as possible. It is a political
    question, a moral question. It is a social question. ... But the whole point is that
    it does not matter what we undertake. If there is no hard work and if there is a
    continuation of the lack of self-reliance that is very widespread among us, then
    there is very little that we will be able to do. In his report today Mikhail
    [Gorbachev] spoke very sharply about this in a very committed way. He repeatedly said
    that it seems it is now necessary to go further in agriculture, especially in the
    area of management. ... [F]rom now on a procedure should be established for the
    collective and state farms to themselves establish who should manage them and how
    they should be managed and what should be done. ... That means they will be
    responsible for everything they do. That is, people's self-interest must be raised
    further. Of course, without this there will be no foodstuffs, there will be nothing,
    nothing at all. Second, it is necessary to socially restructure the
    countryside.<sup><a href="#5.">5</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Thus it is clear that agriculture is the most important and urgent issue.
  The Gorbachev administration is using the mechanisms of lease contracting, brigade
  contracting, agro-firms, agro-combines, etc., to move in the direction of encouraging
  private collectives, widening contract farming and leasing land for something like 50
  years. All this points in the direction of the decollectivization of agriculture, which
  is already very much underway. It is one of the fundamental issues that the reformers
  and the so-called conservatives are at loggerheads over.</p>

  <p>The issue is whether to retain and strengthen the collectivization of agriculture
  and put it on a higher socialist level, the level of an industry, or to go backward
  toward bourgeois relations in agriculture, as for example in Poland and for the most
  part now in China, with all its dire consequences. The stated objective of the
  reformers is to raise the productivity of labor, increase the food supply and make the
  country less dependent on the import of grain and other farm products. Of course,
  nothing is more urgent than the food supply. But the issue is whether to go on with the
  bourgeois reforms in the agricultural field, or to find ways and means of strengthening
  agriculture and increasing the productivity of labor on the basis of advancing
  socialist relations on the land and bringing them to a higher stage of development.
  It's an issue of principle. It certainly is a contradictory road; it's either one or
  the other.</p>

  <p>Therefore, if the Party's position is to go in the direction of decollectivization
  and the bourgeois market, it would be wrong in principle for anyone in favor of
  deepening socialist norms to be put in the position of taking responsibility for the
  agriculture ministry.</p>

  <p>It's the same in a trade union situation. If a strike is in progress and there's a
  difference of opinion over whether to terminate or continue it, it would be wrong for
  the local union executive board or president to appoint someone to take responsibility
  for terminating the strike whose conviction is in the direction of continuing it.</p>

  <p>It is wrong for Ligachev to have taken the post of agriculture minister at this time
  if he is in favor of intensifying socialist agriculture but has to carry out an
  opposite policy. If he was arbitrarily removed from his other responsibilities and put
  into this new position, and is doing it as a matter of Party discipline, it's doubly
  erroneous. He shouldn't accept the post if the policy is at odds with his political
  convictions, and it is wrong for Gorbachev to appoint him to it. Of course, it is
  conceivable to do it as a matter of loyalty to the Party, but that is hardly a way to
  deal with such a critical issue as agriculture.</p>

  <p>The root of the problem lies first of all in the fact that the Central Committee
  meeting wasn't confronted with voting up and down on resolutions which would
  politically explain the divergent positions of the groupings around this crucial issue.
  This democratic procedure, which was so scrupulously followed during the Leninist
  period, was subsequently abandoned in the Stalin era and has not been revived by his
  successors, including the Gorbachev regime. There is never any open voting on
  resolutions up and down the line.</p>

  <p>In a country with a hundred nationalities covering almost 280 million people, how is
  it possible to always come out with unanimous votes on issues which subsequently are
  shown to be in dispute? Could this happen if the restructuring processes were really
  being reviewed and resolutions on them discussed and voted on without fear, the way it
  used to be during the Leninist era and the way it should be in any revolutionary
  working class party where genuine issues are in dispute? As matters stand now, real
  disputes are hidden and have to manifest themselves in other ways, often in the foreign
  press. So that however the restructuring issue was discussed in the Central Committee
  meeting, this is not made available to the public. Yes, it is now more democratic than
  it has been, but a gulf still separates it from the Leninist era.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois press, which showed such extravagant admiration for the Gorbachev
  reforms and was so effusive in its praise of the 19th Party Conference deliberations,
  has become more cautious of late. They hailed Gorbachev for consolidating power in his
  hands by becoming the chairman (president) of the Presidium, but were quick to exploit
  the hasty approval he got from the Central Committee, characterizing it as a break from
  his own policy of democratization.</p>

  <p>The other issue, the nationality question as it is called in the USSR, was again
  shelved. It is a real question as to which was more critical &ndash; the economic
  restructuring plan or the growing unrest among the nationalities. It is well to bear in
  mind the structure of the Soviet state as reflected in the Constitution of the USSR. We
  have more than once called attention to the fact that the USSR state structure is
  composed of two chambers. This is a unique feature of the Soviet system. No capitalist
  country has such a structure.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the two chambers is to give the greatest emphasis to the struggle for
  equality of all the peoples of the USSR. Any issue that deeply concerns the
  nationalities &ndash; such as the struggles in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, etc.
  &ndash; should be at least discussed in the Soviet of the Nationalities. If it is not
  discussed there, then this chamber is a dead letter and has no meaning.</p>

  <p>In fact, one could easily be led to that conclusion by the fact that it is so rarely
  mentioned. And the capitalist press, which usually looks in every nook and corner to
  find some avenue to discredit the USSR, has conspicuously stayed away from pointing
  this out, precisely because it would point up the gross racism and national
  discrimination against oppressed peoples which exists in the bourgeois world, where
  such a body has never existed, not even in form.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the national question, which anyone can now see is a
  critical issue in the USSR, has been given scarce attention by the Gorbachev
  administration, which aroused such high expectations of democratization. Mention of it
  in Gorbachev's report to the 27th Congress could easily be overlooked and succeeding
  reports barely noted it. It took the outbreak of the demonstrations in Armenia and
  Azerbaijan to finally compel the government to deal with it and the press to report it.
  The unrest and disorders forced the June 1988 meeting of the Central Committee to
  discuss it extensively. One would think that, immediately after the outbreak of
  disorders involving at least three of the nationalities, this would be discussed in the
  chamber for which it was erected &ndash; the Soviet of Nationalities. But it hasn't
  been to this date, though it is still not too late to do so.</p>

  <p>The constitution categorically states that the territory of a union republic cannot
  be altered without its consent and that the borders of union republics can only be
  altered by mutual agreement of the corresponding republics and approval by the USSR.
  This has been affirmed repeatedly in the constitutions of 1924, 1936 and 1977 (the
  present one). A speech by Gorbachev to the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium in the summer
  of 1988 confirms the existence of the Soviet of Nationalities; it has not been
  abrogated without public knowledge. He referred to various proposals made for the
  resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem and spoke about:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">... [U]pgrading the status of the region, its powers, and possibilities. This,
    apparently, should not be rejected. These matters need to be solved. We consulted
    with leaders of the republic [Azerbaijan]. Perhaps the resolution, alongside what was
    said in the first part, should contain a provision that a group or a commission be
    formed in the framework of the Soviet of Nationalities to analyze all the proposals
    made here. Later, apparently, other proposals will also be made in the Soviet of
    Nationalities, so that we will thus be able to study this problem better, the more so
    as we approach a reform of the political system that presupposes changes, enhancing
    the rights of union republics, their responsibilities and powers, the widening of the
    rights and status of the autonomous republics. Solutions enhancing the guarantees
    mentioned here could be arrived at in the framework of studying this entire
    matter.<sup><a href="#6.">6</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>So finally, two years after the rebellions in Kazakhstan, after months of
  struggle in Armenia and Azerbaijan and the defiant demonstrations in the Baltic areas,
  we learn of the existence of the Soviet of Nationalities and that a group will be
  formed (how and who will be on it is not mentioned) which will analyze proposals. But
  all this awaits political changes that will presumably widen the rights and status of
  the autonomous republics and "enhance the guarantees."</p>

  <p>But the guarantees are already embodied in the constitution. What is required is for
  the other arm of the Soviet government, the Soviet of Nationalities, to meet and
  discuss, to propose or dispose. When will it meet? There is only a rumor that it will
  meet sometime next year.</p>

  <p>It serves no useful purpose, and will in the long run prove extremely harmful not
  only for Gorbachev and his administration but for the cause of socialism in the USSR,
  for him to blame the nationality problems on the conservatives, as he did in his speech
  to the Presidium.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">It is the adversaries of restructuring, conservative and corrupt elements who waxed
    rich in the period of stagnation that speculate on the problems of Nagorno-Karabakh.
    We, comrades, should not fail to see and realize this. It is of advantage to them to
    distract the attention from themselves by feigning concern for the destiny of
    Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. We know this, we see this, and we shall not lose sight
    of this. The force of Soviet laws should be directed precisely and only against such
    elements.<sup><a href="#7.">7</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>This doesn't explain why the disorders took place during his
  administration and not earlier. Nor does it explain why he didn't raise the question of
  the nationalities where it properly belongs, in the Soviet of Nationalities. Indeed, he
  goes on in his speech to refer to this problem as not only critical and important but
  as "arch-important" and an "arch-complex matter." If that is so, why not take it up in
  the forum where it belongs?</p>

  <p>A speaker identified only as Pogosyan, the first secretary of the Nagorno-Karabakh
  Oblispolkom of Azerbaijan, raised the ghost of Stalin at the Supreme Soviet summer
  session when he said, "How then did Nagorno-Karabakh find itself a part of the
  Azerbaijan SSR? Unfortunately that was a concession to the annexationist ambitions of
  the then leadership of Azerbaijan which, enjoying Stalin's support and skillfully
  speculating on the extremely complex situation in the Transcaucasus and Russia as a
  whole, achieved the incorporation into the Azerbaijan SSR of a territory where more
  than 94 percent of the inhabitants were Armenians." <sup><a href="#8.">8</a></sup> But
  this approach did no good and is strongly disputed by the Azerbaijanis.</p>

  <p>How do they explain the silence on this matter of the two outstanding liberalizers
  who initiated the anti-Stalin struggle? Nikita Khrushchev and Anastas Mikoyan never
  seemed to have noticed the injustice to the Armenians on the specific issue of
  Nagorno-Karabakh, even though Mikoyan, an Armenian, and Khrushchev, a Ukrainian, were
  themselves from formerly oppressed nationalities. Mikoyan was a long-time member of the
  Central Committee and Politburo, a close associate of Khrushchev, president of the
  Supreme Soviet and the very first one to have attacked Stalin after his death.</p>

  <p>The roots of the matter go way back to the beginning of the USSR and to the last
  days of Lenin's life. He warned against Great Russian chauvinism as the principal
  danger in the nationalities problem in the USSR.<sup><a href="#9.">9</a></sup> Then, as
  now, economic reforms which revived the capitalist market also stimulated and
  exacerbated the growth of national animosities, as we have pointed out earlier.
  Basically an appeal to bourgeois individual inclinations, the reforms today are
  generating bourgeois nationalism in inter-ethnic matters as well as in relations
  between the center and the union republics.</p>
