  <h2>Glossary of term and names</h2>

  <p><strong>Andropov, Yuri V.</strong> (1914-1984): Elected general secretary of the
  CPSU November 1982 following death of Leonid Brezhnev. Also became president of the
  USSR in June 1983. Died Feb. 9, 1984.</p>

  <p><strong>Bolsheviks</strong>: The word derives from the Russian <em>bolshinstvo</em>,
  meaning majority. The Bolsheviks under the leadership of Lenin were the majority group
  at the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (1903). Became
  separate party in 1912. Led October revolution in 1917. Party changed its name in 1918
  to the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and in 1924 took on the name it carries to
  this day--Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).</p>

  <p><strong>Bourgeoisie</strong>: The capitalist class. From the Communist Manifesto:
  "By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists, owners of the means of social
  production and the employers of wage labor."</p>

  <p><strong>Brest-Litovsk</strong>: Treaty concluded in 1918 between revolutionary
  Russia and Imperial Germany. German terms were accepted under duress and Russia had to
  concede a huge indemnity and relinquish a large amount of territory. At the time Lenin
  said that without a revolutionary uprising inside Germany, Russia was in no position to
  wage a revolutionary war and needed a breathing space to consolidate the Revolution and
  build a people's army. Trotsky led the Soviet negotiating team.</p>

  <p><strong>Brezhnev, Leonid I.</strong> (1906-1982): Became General Secretary of
  Central Committee in October 1964. In May 1977, became President of the USSR. Led
  Soviet Union until his death on Nov. 10, 1982.</p>

  <p><strong>Bukharin, Nikolai Ivanovich</strong> (1887-1938): Joined Bolsheviks in 1906.
  Leading member of Bolshevik Central Committee during October Revolution. Editor of
  Pravda (1919-29). President of Comintern (1926-29). Leader of Right Opposition to
  Stalin in 1928. Executed after March 1938 Moscow trial.</p>

  <p><strong>Bureaucracy</strong>: The apparatus of administration in the armed forces,
  judiciary and other government organs and institutions. Early in the USSR, the
  conditions of underdevelopment and isolation contributed to the development of a
  privileged and parasitic bureaucracy which stifled the revolutionary initiative of the
  masses. Lenin said of the bureaucracy: "I hate it heartily. Not the individual
  bureaucrat, he may be a capable rascal. But I hate the system. It paralyzes and
  corrupts from above and below."</p>

  <p><strong>Chernenko, Konstantin U.</strong> (1912-1985): Succeeded Yuri Andropov as
  General Secretary of the CPSU, February 1984. Died March 10, 1985.</p>

  <p><strong>Cold War</strong>: Policy of U.S., West European and Japanese imperialism
  toward the Soviet Union following World War II. Period of active hostility to socialist
  countries, including subversion, sabotage and acts of terrorism with
  counterrevolutionary wars fought against emerging independence movements in Asia,
  Africa and Latin America. Called a cold war since the imperialist powers, particularly
  the U.S., did not openly invade the Soviet Union or bomb it with nuclear weapons, but
  instead engaged in so-called lower intensity actions around the world.</p>

  <p><strong>Collectivization</strong>: A change in property relations from private
  ownership to group ownership, a step below ownership by the state. Policy of compulsory
  collectivization of agriculture was announced on December 27, 1929, by Stalin; it began
  on February 1, 1930. At the time the kulaks had seized the Soviet state by the throat,
  organizing a veritable strike against food supplies for the cities.</p>

  <p><strong>Comintern</strong>: See Communist International.</p>

  <p><strong>Communist International</strong>: Founded in 1919 in Moscow to unite world
  Communist parties and coordinate revolutionary struggles. Also known by the shortened
  name Comintern. Dissolved by Stalin in 1943.</p>

  <p><strong>Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU)</strong>: See Bolsheviks.</p>

  <p><strong>Denikin, A.I.</strong> (1872-1947): Czarist general and prominent
  counterrevolutionary in the Civil War.</p>

  <p><strong>Entrepreneur</strong>: French word which translates roughly as
  "enterpriser." In capitalism, a speculator who invests capital in stocks, land and
  machinery, as well as the exploitation of wage labor, in the pursuit of profits.</p>

  <p><strong>Five-Year Plan</strong>: The first Five-Year Plan for industrialization and
  collectivization went into effect in the Soviet Union in 1929. It was completed in four
  years. This was despite the stock market crash on Wall Street and the world capitalist
  collapse at the time, which had considerably reduced the market for Soviet goods and
  the foreign currency desired to complete the plan. In economic history, it was the
  first comprehensive plan to cover the rate and scale of a country's economic and social
  development. Five-Year Plans set targets as the basic framework for planning a
  socialist economy.</p>

  <p><strong>Glasnost</strong>: Policy introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev in the USSR in
  1985. While perestroika is a change in the economic policies, glasnost is a shift in
  political practices. Glasnost is described by Gorbachev as a program for openness and
  democratization.</p>

  <p><strong>Gorbachev, Mikhail</strong> (1931- ): Elected General Secretary of the CPSU
  March 1985; became President of the USSR in September 1988.</p>

  <p><strong>Gorky, Maxim</strong> (1868-1936): Prominent Russian writer. Joined
  Bolsheviks in 1905. Helped organize first legal Bolshevik paper. Headed state
  publishing after revolution until 1921. Works include the play <em>The Lower
  Depths</em> (1902) and the novel <em>Mother</em> (1906).</p>

  <p><strong>Gosplan</strong>: The State Planning Commission of the Soviet Union. The
  word is formed from the first syllables of the words of the title.</p>

  <p><strong>Imperialism</strong>: The highest, and last, stage of capitalism. As defined
  by Lenin, imperialism is the merging of bank capital with industrial capital to create
  finance capital; industry is increasingly dominated by monopolies; the export of
  capital becomes more important than the export of commodities; super-profits are
  obtained by imperialist super-exploitation of the less developed countries.</p>

  <p><strong>Intelligentsia</strong>: Intellectuals, usually referring to professionals
  such as writers, lawyers, doctors, engineers, professors, scientists. The
  intelligentsia is a middle stratum between the bourgeoisie and proletariat. Generally
  has greater ideological links with the bourgeoisie, but vacillates between the workers
  and capitalists. In a workers' state, the intelligentsia usually has elements with ties
  to the old bourgeois order.</p>

  <p><strong>Kautsky, Karl</strong> (1854-1938): Assistant to Engels. Leader of German
  Social Democratic Party and Socialist (Second) International before first world
  imperialist war. Became a reformist and pacifist centrist, refusing to condemn the

  October 1964.</p>

  <p><strong>Kronstadt</strong>: Naval base where sailors staged a counterrevolutionary
  uprising in March 1921 against severe measures of War Communism. Lenin's New Economic
  Policy was adopted shortly after the uprising was suppressed.</p>

  <p><strong>Kulak</strong>: A Russian term meaning fist, popularly used to refer to rich
  peasants who owned land and hired poor peasants to work it. Lenin described the kulaks
  as "exploiters and profiteers who used their surplus grain to enrich themselves at the
  expense of the starving non-agricultural parts of Russia."</p>

  <p><strong>Lassalle, Ferdinand</strong> (1825-1864): Participant in 1848 German
  revolution. Founder and president of General Association of German Workers, first labor
  party in that country. Killed in a duel. His followers joined with Marxists in 1875 to
  form German Social Democratic Party, which adopted the Gotha Program. The program was
  severely criticized by Marx.</p>

  <p><strong>Left Opposition</strong>: Faction led by Leon Trotsky in the Communist Party
  of the Soviet Union as well as the Communist International. Formed in 1923.</p>

  <p><strong>Lenin, V.I.</strong> (1870-1924): Central theoretical and political leader
  of Bolsheviks from 1903. Participated in 1905-7 Russian revolution. Organized
  Zimmerwald Left in 1915-17 which brought together working class representatives from
  various European countries who issued a manifesto condemning the First World War and
  calling for a revolutionary struggle against the war. Led Bolshevik Central Committee
  during October Revolution. Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (premier).
  Central leader and founder of Communist International.</p>

  <p><strong>Levelers</strong>: Historically, during the English Civil War, a movement of
  independent farmers with a radical program calling for a democratic republic and
  political and religious equality. The Levelers, led by John Lilburne, and their
  left-wing program were defeated by the increasingly conservative Oliver Cromwell. Today
  the term is used derisively by the Gorbachev grouping in the Soviet Union to
  characterize those who support raising the lot of the lower paid to achieve economic
  equality.</p>

  <p><strong>Mensheviks</strong>: From Russian word for minority. Formed in 1903 at
  Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party as a minority opposition
  to the position of Lenin and the Bolsheviks (majority). Became the right-wing of the
  party and split with Bolsheviks in 1912. Opposed the 1917 October Revolution.</p>

  <p><strong>Molotov, Vyacheslav Mikhailovich</strong> (1890-1986): Joined Bolsheviks in
  1906. Candidate member of Politburo in 1921, full member in 1926. Premier of USSR
  1930-41. Foreign Minister 1939-49 and 1953-56. In 1939, signed nonaggression pact with
  Nazi Germany.</p>

  <p><strong>Monopoly capitalism</strong>: The era of the domination of monopolies that
  control, sometimes completely, production of commodities. Period of large-scale
  production with the concentration and centralization of capital. The substitution of
  free competition by monopoly is a fundamental feature of imperialism. Giant banks are
  fused with the monopoly industries to form finance capital. Lenin says, "The growth of
  monopoly and the growth of finance-capital put the entire fate of the capitalist world
  in the hands of small groups of the biggest capitalists. The merging of bank capital
  with industrial capital brings about a situation where the biggest bankers begin to
  manage industry, and the biggest industrialists are admitted into bank directorates.
  The fate of the entire economic life of every capitalist country lies in the hands of a
  numerically insignificant group of bankers and industrial monopolists."</p>

  <p><strong>Moscow Trials</strong>: Three major purge trials held in Moscow between 1936
  and 1938. All the surviving members of the Politburo of the Communist Party during the
  Revolution, except for Stalin, were tried and convicted of frameup charges. All except
  Trotsky, who was in exile, were executed or were alleged to have committed suicide.</p>

  <p><strong>New Economic Policy (NEP)</strong>: The policy introduced in Soviet Russia
  in 1921 which allowed a certain revival of capitalism. It replaced War Communism, the
  economic policy pursued in the period of the Civil War. The NEP was introduced as a
  temporary measure to help overcome the economic destruction resulting from the first
  world imperialist war and the subsequent Civil War and invasion by the imperialist
  powers, including the U.S. armed forces.</p>

  <p><strong>Nepmen</strong>: During the period of the New Economic Policy, traders and
  businessmen emerged. These profit-mongers became known popularly as nepmen. Lenin
  described them as the new bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p><strong>October Revolution</strong>: Russian Revolution of October 25, 1917. The
  date was based on the old czarist calendar. Today it is celebrated by the current
  calendar on November 7.</p>

  <p><strong>Oppressed nations</strong>: See self-determination.</p>

  <p><strong>Paris Commune of 1871</strong>: First workers' government. Existed from
  March 18 to May 28, 1871. Replaced standing army with universal arming of the people.
  Made all offices in the courts and civil service elective, decreeing that salaries
  should not exceed workers' wages. On May 21, the troops of Thiers' counterrevolutionary
  government broke into Paris and massacred the workers; 30,000 were killed, 50,000
  arrested.</p>

  <p><strong>Pilsudski, Josef</strong> (1867-1935): Landowner and general in Poland.
  Between 1918 and 1922, headed Polish regime that brutally persecuted the revolutionary
  movement in that country. Led invasion of Soviet republic in 1920. Right-wing dictator
  of Poland 1926-35.</p>

  <p><strong>Politburo</strong>: Short for political bureau. The executive committee of
  the Central Committee of the Communist Party. The Central Committee is elected by the
  Party Congress, the highest body in the party.</p>

  <p><strong>Proletariat</strong>: Wage workers. From the Communist Manifesto: "By
  proletariat [is meant] the class of modern wage laborers, who, having no means of
  production of their own, are reduced to selling their labor-power in order to
  live."</p>

  <p><strong>Rapallo treaty</strong>: German-Soviet treaty signed April 16, 1922, that
  nullified the 1918 Brest-Litovsk treaty.</p>

  <p><strong>Rykov, Aleksei Ivanovich</strong> (1881-1938): Joined Russian Social
  Democratic Party in 1899. Succeeded Lenin as Chairman of the Council of People's
  Commissars 1924-30. With Bukharin, part of Right Opposition. Sentenced to death in
  third Moscow trial in 1938.</p>

  <p><strong>Ryzhkov, Nikolai I.</strong> (1929- ): Prime Minister of the Soviet Union
  beginning September 1985 and Chairman of the Council of Ministers.</p>

  <p><strong>Scientific-technological revolution</strong>: Restructuring of industry and
  economic infrastructure based on the introduction of new high-tech systems of
  production, often relying on computerization and robotics. Like the introduction of the
  assembly line in the 1920s, the scientific-technological revolution in the 1980s has
  brought a dramatic upheaval in the workforce in the capitalist countries. In the U.S.,
  the changed character of the working class can be seen in the emergence of women and
  Third World workers as the new majority in the workplace.</p>

  <p><strong>Self-determination</strong>: A nation can be roughly defined as a people
  with a common language and history who inhabit a definite area, though there are
  exceptions to this. Oppressed nations are those forcibly subjugated by another nation,
  a key feature of the emergence of capitalism and imperialism. Self-determination is the
  right of oppressed peoples to govern themselves, including the right of nations to
  independent existence as sovereign states. Marxists support national liberation
  movements seeking to end national oppression while at the same time promoting working
  class unity. The right of self-determination was a key part of the Bolshevik program
  for dealing with the many nationalities in czarist Russia. For the first time in
  history, the Bolsheviks in 1923 established a bicameral government with two equal
  bodies--the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities--to guarantee
  representation for the more than 100 nationalities in the USSR. The constitution
  adopted at that time stated in Article 6 that the right of secession could not be
  repealed, nor could the boundaries of the republics be changed without their mutual
  consent.</p>

  <p><strong>Soviet</strong>: Russian word meaning council.</p>

  <p><strong>Sovkhoz</strong>: State farm.</p>

  <p><strong>Stakhanovite movement</strong>: On August 30, 1935, coal miner Alexei
  Stakhanov was reported to have mined a record 102 tons in a single shift, 14 times the
  normal quota. Publicity of this event was used to encourage socialist emulation in
  production, known as the Stakhanovite movement. It helped to spark rapid
  industrialization in the Soviet Union at a time when the capitalist world was suffering
  its worst depression. However, it also was seen by many workers as a form of speedup
  that undermined socialist solidarity.</p>

  <p><strong>Stalin, Joseph</strong> (1879-1953): Bolshevik from 1903. Member of Central
  Committee 1912. People's Commissar of Nationalities after October Revolution. General
  Secretary of Central Committee from 1922 until his death in 1953. Lenin called for his
  removal in January 1923, but this letter was suppressed. Stalin led centrist faction in
  Party after Lenin's death, eventually eliminating all opposition. Purged Party of Old
  Bolsheviks, staging frameup trials in Moscow in 1930s. Led Soviet Union in historic
  victory over invading Nazi army in the second world imperialist war.</p>

  <p><strong>State</strong>: In its essence, the instruments by which the class in power
  suppresses another or other classes, i.e., the army, police, judiciary, etc.</p>

  <p><strong>Thermidor</strong>: The eleventh month in the calendar adopted by the French
  Revolution in the 1790s. On the ninth of Thermidor (July 27), 1794, Robespierre was
  overthrown, starting shifts to the right in the government that opened the way for
  Bonaparte and the destruction of the First Republic. Thermidor has become the name of a
  period of reaction when it follows a revolutionary upsurge.</p>

  <p><strong>Tomsky, Mikhail Pavlovich</strong> (1880-1936): Joined Russian Social
  Democratic Party in 1904. Chairman Soviet trade unions 1922-29. Member of Politburo
  from 1922. Allied with Bukharin in Right Opposition. Died during first Moscow
  trial.</p>

  <p><strong>Trotsky, Leon</strong> (1879-1940): Proponent of world revolution. Leader of
  Russian Revolution in 1905, president of St. Petersburg Soviet (later to be called
  Petrograd). Supporter of Zimmerwald Left in 1914. Joined Bolsheviks in 1917, elected to
  Central Committee. As president of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' Deputies, led the
  October Revolution together with Lenin. Commissar of Foreign Affairs 1917-18. Led Red
  Army 1918-25, organizing defeat of invasion by U.S., England and other imperialist
  countries as well as victory in Civil War. Leading figure in Communist International,
  writing many of its principal statements during the first five years. Led Left
  Opposition in 1920s. Expelled from Party 1927, exiled abroad 1929. Main defendant, in
  absentia, at 1936-38 Moscow trials. Assassinated in Mexico June 1940 by agent of
  Stalin.</p>

  <p><strong>War Communism</strong>: The name given to the economic measures that
  prevailed while the Russian Revolution was fighting for its survival during the Civil
  War. It involved nationalizing and centralizing the economy more extensively and sooner
  than the Bolsheviks had originally planned. The produce of peasants was requisitioned
  or confiscated to feed the workers in the cities and the Red Army. Private trading was
  prohibited and distribution of goods was on the basis of rationing. Replaced by the New
  Economic Policy.</p>
