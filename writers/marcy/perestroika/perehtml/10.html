  </blockquote>

  <p>In June 1987, an article appeared in the well-known Soviet magazine Novy
  Mir which created somewhat of a sensation in the USSR with its sweeping attacks on the
  Soviet economy and proposals on how to restructure it. The article was written by
  Nikolai Shmelyov, an economist at the Institute for the U.S. and Canada in Moscow, a
  very important arm of the government. This article is not just the expression of an
  individual, but is representative of the thinking of a considerable layer of the Soviet
  intelligentsia, including some of the political leaders and some economists. Among the
  latter are Fedor Burladskii, A.P. Dutenko and E.A. Ambartsumov. Among the political
  leaders in this current is Boris P. Kurashvili, a lawyer who has been most vocal in
  praise of the Hungarian reforms. He is also a leading figure in the Institute for State
  and Law under the Academy of Sciences in Moscow. The New York Times of May 24, 1988,
  reported that he, along with economist Tatyana Zaslavskaya, is a leading proponent of a
  proposal to develop an organization which would perform some of the functions of a
  political party and be what the Times called an "alternative" to the Communist Party.</p>

  <p>Whether what may be called the Shmelyov thesis, as it appeared in Novy Mir, has deep
  and wide adherence remains to be seen, especially after the extraordinary Party
  Conference scheduled for June 1988.</p>

  <p>The article, far from concealing the basic views of the author, is on the contrary
  quite open and blunt, if not outright brazen. Because of the widespread interest it
  generated, General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev himself was forced to respond to it.
  Thus, on June 22, 1987, at a meeting he attended in electoral district Number 5,
  Krasnaya Borough, Moscow, Gorbachev was asked by a reporter from Pravda about "many
  pointed, controversial materials on restructuring" which were appearing in the Soviet
  press. Did recent writings on restructuring give "questionable prescriptions for
  surmounting our difficulties? For example, economist Shmelyov's article in Novy
  Mir."</p>

  <p>Gorbachev replied, "I would divide that article into two parts. The first is an
  analysis of the state of affairs in the economy, and it presents a picture that is
  close to what actually exists and we will talk about that at the plenary session.</p>

  <p>"The second part is what the author proposes," Gorbachev continued. "He apparently
  proposes, for example, that there be unemployment. That's not for us. We are well aware
  of our weaknesses and unresolved problems, but neither can we forget the fact that
  socialism has given every one of us the right to work and to an education, free medical
  service, and accessible housing. These are genuine values in our society which provide
  social protection for the individual today and for the future." <sup><a href=
  "#1.">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>Then Gorbachev added, "The measure of consumption is another matter. Socialism is
  not a system of dependence. Needs grow but they must be managed. But the main thing in
  that work is the implementation of the basic principle of socialism, to each according
  to his labor."</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding Gorbachev's assurances, the Shmelyov thesis continues to be of more
  than topical significance. It is, in fact, the platform of the neobourgeois elements in
  the government. It can be contrasted to the platform of the so-called conservatives
  published on March 13, 1988, in Sovetskaya Rossiya in the form of a letter by Nina
  Andreyeva, an instructor at a Leningrad high school.</p>

  <p>Superficially all this appears to be a reappearance of the older, classical
  divisions of right, left and center in the Party polemics of the early 1920s. These
  designations, however, have only the faintest resemblance to those polemics, which were
  represented by Bukharin on the right, the Trotskyist opposition on the left, and Stalin
  and his supporters in the center. Today the entire historical context has changed. But
  it is helpful to consider them merely from the point of view of analogy.</p>

  <p>Shmelyov's thesis scarcely compares with Bukharin's views on a market economy or on
  dealing with the peasantry in the development of socialism. All the participants at
  that time had been thoroughly grounded in Marxist doctrines and trained in the school
  of Bolshevism. The Shmelyov thesis is a lamentable bourgeois economic critique of the
  problems of the Soviet economy. While Gorbachev took great care to distance himself
  from Shmelyov's conclusions and prescriptions, he nevertheless approved his criticisms,
  which are inescapably linked to the conclusions. It is quite impossible to accept
  Shmelyov's criticisms, let alone his conclusions.</p>

  <p>Shmelyov's thesis is calculated to test out the affirmations made again and again by
  the Party leadership, especially Gorbachev,<sup><a href="#2.">2</a></sup> that no
  unemployment will result from the restructuring and that none is contemplated.
  Nevertheless, it is necessary to see precisely what Shmelyov's criticisms are as well
  as his prescriptions. The grouping he represents seems formidable, from the point of
  view of both economics and politics.</p>

  <p>First, he says there is unemployment in the Soviet Union today:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">... the natural unemployment that results from people looking for or changing jobs is
    hardly less than 2 percent of the work force at any given time, and that figure is
    probably more like 3 percent if one adds in the hoboes who are unaccounted for in the
    official records.<sup><a href="#3.">3</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>If the hoboes, as he calls them, are not accounted for in the official
  records, where does he get his unofficial records? Who are the so-called hoboes and
  where do they come from? Are they the people who move from one economic ministry to
  another, who travel from them to some of the splendid dachas in the suburbs, or who
  spend their time abroad?</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">So it is one thing to discuss the matter while pretending that there is no
    unemployment whatsoever in our country, and it is something quite different to do so
    while calmly taking account of the fact that there is some unemployment in our
    country and there would have to be.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Why would there have to be? He doesn't explain.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">We must also not close our eyes to the economic harm that results from our
    parasitical certainty of guaranteed employment.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Guaranteed employment, we learn from this sage of bourgeois economics,
  doesn't bring security and an opening of the well-spring of initiative of the working
  class, especially since the means of production are owned by them, but on the contrary
  creates parasitism. Even Milton Friedman is not quite as brutally frank about his
  thesis. But again, who are the real parasites? Are they in the bureaucracy or are they
  in the mines, mills, factories, offices and farms?</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">I think it's clear to everyone that we owe much of today's disorder, drunkenness and
    shoddy workmanship to overemployment.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Again, who is he aiming at? Those with their own wine cellars and private
  champagne parties? Or is it again the workers? In the capitalist countries drunkenness
  and social disorder are considered a result of unemployment. Shmelyov has the dubious
  distinction of being the first economist to proclaim that overemployment is the cause
  of drunkenness and, moreover, shoddy workmanship.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">We should have a businesslike and unflinching discussion of what the benefits might
    be from a relatively small reserve work force (one that the state would not entirely
    abandon to the whims of fate, of course).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In fact, such a discussion is going on and his grouping is vigorously
  pushing it.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">A real danger of losing one's job and going on temporary unemployment pay, or of
    having to work where one is sent, is rather good medicine against sloth, drunkenness
    and irresponsibility. Many experts feel that it would be cheaper to pay adequate
    unemployment compensation for a few months to such temporarily unemployed than it is
    to keep a lot of <strong>fearless loafers</strong> [emphasis added  &ndash;  S.M.] in the
    work force who could scuttle (and are scuttling) any and all economic accountability
    and any and all efforts to improve the quality and efficiency of social labor.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Shmelyov bolsters his thesis with the authority of another economist.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">The well-known Soviet economist S. Shatalin stresses that "socialism has yet to
    create a mechanism that ensures not just full employment ... but full employment that
    is socially and economically effective and rational. Socialist principles are not
    charity principles that automatically guarantee everyone a job, irrespective of his
    aptitude for it."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Earlier, Shmelyov had vented his spleen in a broad attack against the
  working class.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">Apathy, indifference, theft and lack of respect for honest work are rampant, as is
    aggressive envy toward those who enjoy high earnings  &ndash;  even in cases where the
    earnings are honestly come by. There are signs of an almost physical degradation of
    the Soviet people as a result of drunkenness and sloth. And finally, there is
    distrust of announced goals and intentions, and skepticism about the possibility of
    organizing economic and social life in a more sensible fashion.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is hard to believe that General Secretary Gorbachev considers this to
  be mere criticism. No, this criticism is altogether programmatic in character and it is
  anti-working class beyond any and all doubt. It's the kind of criticism that was
  rampant from the earliest days of the Revolution and continued into the late 1920s.
  Except for slight changes in form, Shmelyov's attacks are a rewrite 70 years later of
  the propaganda of the Russian bourgeoisie, landlords and bosses. Not even the Social
  Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, enemies of the Soviet regime, ever resorted to such
  tripe.</p>

  <p>Isn't it a fact that workers here in the U.S. hear this same type of attack again
  and again in the capitalist press? Who has not heard the accusations of laziness, low
  productivity, disinterest in production and the work ethic? What are the causes of
  it?</p>

  <p>According to the Shmelyov thesis:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">The reason for our difficulties is not merely the heavy burden of military
    expenditures and the very costly scope of the country's global responsibilities.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He's brushing off what has been seen as the main problem, not only in the
  USSR but in the capitalist countries as well. How can anyone deny that the heavy burden
  imposed by imperialist armaments on the whole world, not just the USSR, is one of the
  basic reasons for a declining living standard? Of course, he wouldn't care to give a
  breakdown of how much the imperialist-imposed burden of armaments consumes of the
  Soviet gross national product. As a matter of fact, it has long been the hope of the
  imperialists that the acceleration of the arms race would ultimately bankrupt the USSR.
  Shmelyov, however, says the problem isn't just the heavy burden of military
  expenditures. What then is it? And here he finally discloses the real crux of the
  matter:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">It is the persistent and prolonged attempts to circumvent the objective laws of
    economic life and to suppress established, age-old work incentives that has
    ultimately led to results opposite from those being sought.<sup><a href=
    "#4.">4</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Now, this is something really worth examining. What objective laws of
  economic life have been circumvented? Which age-old work incentives have been
  suppressed? First of all, there are no objective laws of economic life in general. Marx
  claimed to have discovered only the objective laws governing <strong>capitalist
  society</strong>. Does Shmelyov know of any other laws that govern economic life? What
  were the "age-old work incentives" under slavery, for instance? Under feudalism? What
  work incentives were there under the czarist autocracy when the bosses owned and
  controlled the plants and the landlords worked the peasants to death? What age-old work
  incentives is he talking about that were destroyed?</p>

  <p>Marx discovered capitalist accumulation. This law was not circumvented in the USSR,
  it was <strong>abolished</strong> by the proletarian revolution. The law of the
  extraction of surplus value by the capitalists from the exploited working class was not
  circumvented  &ndash;  it too was abolished.</p>

  <p>As long as the capitalist class existed in Russia, as long as they were allowed to
  own and operate the plants, there existed the law of capitalist accumulation and the
  law of the extraction of surplus value, that is, of exploiting the workers and reducing
  them to wage slaves. Those were the fundamental objective laws governing economic life
  in the entire preceding era that began with the development of capitalism in the USSR,
  which Lenin analyzed in 1899 in his "The Development of Capitalism in
  Russia."<sup><a href="#5.">5</a></sup> There was no circumvention of these laws. There
  was outright abolition by virtue of the seizure of power by the workers and the
  overthrow of the landlords and the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>What is Shmelyov driving at? Certainly if the Soviet economy is up against certain
  objective laws, those laws must be enumerated and carefully examined to see if they can
  be modified or abolished, or if the system can be put in accord with them. On this
  point he is silent, as are all his co-thinkers. However, he does give us sufficient
  reason to believe that what he has in mind is really a restoration in some form of the
  laws of capitalist development. For we read:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">If we do not admit that the rejection of Lenin's New Economic Policy imposed severe
    difficulties on the building of socialism in the USSR, we will doom ourselves once
    again  &ndash;  as in 1953 and 1965  &ndash;  to half-measures, and half-measures, as we know, are
    often worse than no measures at all. The "administered" economy that replaced the NEP
    was by its very nature unable to address questions of quality and efficiency and
    achieved its quantitative results in spite of the laws of economics, and therefore at
    great cost in material and human resources.<sup><a href="#6.">6</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There you have it. What Shmelyov is really for is the restoration of the
  New Economic Policy of the early 1920s. He and some of his co-thinkers, like Fedor
  Burladskii, A.P. Dutenko and E.A. Ambartsumov, all lean in the direction of harking
  back to a difficult period which socialist construction has overcome. Some of the new
  bourgeois reformist economists in Eastern Europe, especially Hungary and Poland, have
  also shown a strong inclination in the direction of the NEP.</p>

  <p>What was this period and how should we characterize it? How did Lenin, who proposed
  it, characterize it? The New Economic Policy was explained by Lenin in October 1921 in
  a report to the Second Congress of Political Education Departments.<sup><a href=
  "#7.">7</a></sup></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">At the beginning of 1918 we expected a period in which peaceful construction would be
    possible. When the Brest peace was signed it seemed that danger had subsided for a
    time and that it would be possible to start peaceful construction. But we were
    mistaken, because in 1918 a real military danger overtook us ... and the outbreak of
    civil war, which dragged on until 1920. Partly owing to the war problems that
    overwhelmed us and partly owing to the desperate position in which the Republic found
    itself when the imperialist war ended  &ndash;  owing to these circumstances, and a number of
    others, we made the mistake of deciding to go over directly to communist production
    and distribution. We thought that under the surplus-food appropriation system the
    peasants would provide us with the required quantity of grain, which we could
    distribute among the factories and thus achieve communist production and
    distribution. ...<br /><br />

    That, unfortunately, is a fact. I say unfortunately, because brief experience
    convinced us that that line was wrong, that it ran counter to what we had previously
    written about the transition from capitalism to socialism, namely, that it would be
    impossible to bypass the period of socialist accounting and control in approaching
    even the lower stage of communism. Ever since 1917, when the problem of taking power
    arose and the Bolsheviks explained it to the whole people, our theoretical literature
    has been definitely stressing the necessity for a prolonged, complex transition
    through socialist accounting and control from capitalist society (and the less
    developed it is the longer the transition will take) to even one of the approaches to
    communist society.<br /><br />

    At that time, when in the heat of the Civil War we had to take the necessary steps
    in economic organization, it seemed to have been forgotten. In substance, our New
    Economic Policy signifies that, having sustained severe defeat on this point, we have
    started a strategical retreat. We said in effect: "Before we are completely routed,
    let us retreat and reorganize everything, but on a firmer basis. ..." <sup><a href=
    "#8.">8</a></sup><br /><br />

    The New Economic Policy means substituting a tax for the requisitioning of food;
    it means reverting to capitalism to a considerable extent  &ndash;  to what extent we do not
    know. Concessions to foreign capitalists (true, only very few have been accepted,
    especially when compared with the number we have offered) and leasing enterprises to
    private capitalists definitely mean restoring capitalism, and this is part and parcel
    of the New Economic Policy. ...<sup><a href="#9.">9</a></sup><br /><br />

    The issue in the present war is  &ndash;  who will win, who will first take advantage of
    the situation: the capitalist, whom we are allowing to come in by the door, and even
    by several doors (and by many doors we are not aware of, and which open without us,
    and in spite of us), or proletarian state power? ...<br /><br />

    On the other hand, if capitalism gains by it, industrial production will grow, and
    the proletariat will grow too. The capitalists will gain from our policy and will
    create an industrial proletariat, which in our country, owing to the war and to the
    desperate poverty and ruin, has become declassed, i.e., dislodged from its class
    groove, and has ceased to exist as a proletariat. The proletariat is the class which
    is engaged in the production of material values in large-scale capitalist industry.
    Since large-scale capitalist industry has been destroyed, since the factories are at
    a standstill, the proletariat has disappeared. It has sometimes figured in
    statistics, but it has not been held together economically.<br /><br />

    The restoration of capitalism would mean the restoration of a proletarian class
    engaged in the production of socially useful material values in big factories
    employing machinery. ...<sup><a href="#10.">10</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lenin did not mince words. He called things by their real names.</p>

  <p>The period preceding NEP had been characterized by the fact that the proletariat had
  nearly disappeared as a result of the imperialist war, the civil war and the
  counterrevolution. Thus, one of the great motivations for NEP was not just commerce and
  trading, it was to restore and build up a proletariat. How unlike the USSR today, which
  has an enormous proletariat, one of the most numerous in the world! Large-scale
  production? The Soviet Union is second only to the U.S.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">The whole question is who will take the lead. We must face this issue squarely  &ndash;  who
    will come out on top? Either the capitalists succeed in organizing first  &ndash;  in which
    case they will drive out the Communists and that will be the end of it. Or the
    proletarian state power, with the support of the peasantry, will prove capable of
    keeping a proper rein on those gentlemen, the capitalists, so as to direct capitalism
    along state channels and to create a capitalism that will be subordinate to the state
    and serve the state.<sup><a href="#11.">11</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>With respect to the partial restoration of capitalism, Lenin said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">Our Party must make the masses realize that the enemy in our midst is anarchic
    capitalism and anarchic commodity exchange. We ourselves must see clearly that the
    issue in this struggle is: Who will win? Who will gain the upper hand? <sup><a href=
    "#12.">12</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As can be seen, Lenin did not try to embellish his New Economic Policy. He
  said that the question posed by the partial restoration of capitalism was who would
  win; would it lead to the restoration of the old ruling class and old bourgeoisie and
  with it the overthrow of the communist regime, or would the proletarian dictatorship
  survive and get rid of the bourgeoisie? Not a single phrase in this report or any other
  by Lenin on the subject praises capitalist trade and commerce, or the leasing of
  property to foreign capitalists. He didn't sing paeans to the glories of the capitalist
  market. He characterized capitalist commodity exchange as "the enemy in our midst."
  Lenin frankly and very clearly stated that the NEP was a partial return to capitalism.
  That is something that every school child in the USSR should know.</p>

  <p>After trials and tribulations and even horrendous mistakes on the part of the new
  revolutionary government, the capitalists did lose out. The NEP period was finally
  abolished and socialist construction, vast industrialization and collectivization were
  begun.</p>

  <p>The NEP was an attempt to rescue the Soviet Union from collapse after its industry
  had been ravaged and virtually destroyed and the working class exhausted by the long
  Civil War, imperialist intervention and rebellions (such as the 1921 uprising in
  Kronstadt). The program was openly admitted to be a retreat that was necessary in order
  to take forward steps later.</p>

  <p>All the contending factions in the Party at that time saw the NEP as a breathing
  spell. However, there were various approaches on how to take the next step towards
  reconstructing the USSR on a socialist basis. The only question was how to do it. No
  one thought of the NEP as a permanent state of development. But that is not the way
  Shmelyov and his supporters are reviewing that period.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">A retreat of sorts it was, of course, but its enduring significance lies elsewhere.
    ... It marked the transition to a system that would mobilize rather than suppress,
    all of the working people's creative energies  &ndash;  the transition from "administrative
    socialism" to "economic-accountability socialism." Three practical ideas were central
    to Lenin's plan for putting the economy on a normal, healthy basis. First,
    commodity-money and market relations were to be developed. ... Second,
    economic-accountability trusts, voluntarily organized into associations (syndicates)
    were to be the economy's basic operating units. Third, cooperative property and
    cooperative relations were to be developed not merely in the countryside, but in
    urban areas as well  &ndash;  in industry, construction, retail trade and in what we now call
    consumer services.<sup><a href="#13.">13</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This reactionary fantasy as described by Shmelyov runs up against the
  reality of what was taking place. One, the reintroduction of a commodity economy,
  especially in agrarian relations, gave rise to the kulak class  &ndash;  the very rich
  peasants. It aided the exploiting rich against the millions of exploited poor. It gave
  rise to the avaricious profit-mongers known as nepmen: the brokers between city and
  village, the new trading class, a new bourgeoisie that became even more hated than the
  old one, particularly since it arose right on the heels of this greatest of all social
  revolutions. That's not what the working class and the peasantry had shed their blood
  for.</p>

  <p>Lenin had no illusions about any of this. He characterized commodity production as
  the enemy that was necessary for a time until it could be superseded by large-scale
  socialist planning.</p>

  <p>It should be very plain that in Shmelyov's pompous talk about circumventing the
  "objective laws of economic life," he is talking about the laws governing
  <strong>capitalism</strong>. These had to be partially restored under trying
  circumstances in the USSR, but it was then necessary to proceed toward socialist
  construction without the kulaks, without the nepmen, without the myriad of new
  middlemen, the new commercial bourgeoisie which was consuming such a vast part of the
  social product and at the same time strengthening its political role.</p>

  <p>The NEP period finally culminated in crisis. It was necessary to move forward with
  the collectivization of the peasantry, which ushered in a most difficult period in
  Soviet history. Few subjects are as confused and lend themselves to as much political
  tendentiousness in the present era of the Soviet reforms as the collectivization. It
  cannot be stated too categorically that the collectivization of agriculture in the USSR
  was a highly progressive development. It was in fact an additional social revolution, a
  change in the mode of production from private ownership to collective semi-socialist
  ownership. It at the same time freed millions of peasants for industry and created a
  strong and formidable proletariat that became the basis for the industrialization of
  the USSR and the success of the five-year plans that followed. This is incontestable.
  But the neobourgeois critics such as Shmelyov deliberately confuse this with the forced
  pace of collectivization and the repression that accompanied it under the
  administration of Stalin, resulting in wholly unnecessary and unwarranted
  destruction.</p>

  <p>Trying to disqualify socialist property in favor of bourgeois private property,
  whether it be in agriculture or industry, is a reactionary attempt to bring back the
  old exploiting order. It is necessary to show clearly and unequivocally what was wrong
  with the Stalin method of collectivization, but at the same time not to confuse the
  issue so as to support bourgeois decollectivization of agriculture and dismemberment of
  socialist industry under the guise of decentralization.<sup><a href=
  "#14.">14</a></sup></p>

  <p>It is necessary to distinguish the repression and arbitrary decision-making of the
  Stalin period from socialist administrative measures in general, which are necessary
  for the functioning of a socialist economy. Again and again the neobourgeois economists
  use the terms "administrative measures" and "command economy." While they may apply in
  some areas, it has become ever so clear with each passing day that they are subterfuges
  for attacking socialist planning and administration of the economy. This should not be
  confused with legitimate criticism to overcome bureaucracy, over-centralized ministries
  and arbitrary management decisions. That's a different aspect of the struggle.</p>

  <p>To continue with Shmelyov:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">The decision on the new economic mechanism in agriculture is a half-measure. We need
    to go the rest of the way. ... Collective and state farms must have the right to sell
    their output freely to state and cooperative organizations and to consumers. ...
    [P]ersonal auxiliary farming must be put fully on a par with collective farming in
    terms of both economic and social rights.<sup><a href="#15.">15</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>These are ill-disguised measures to undermine collective farms rather than
  develop them further. Personal and collective farming are put on an equal basis. But
  the unrestricted right to buy and sell is nothing but an open road to commodity
  production. The idea that a buy-and-sell money economy would lead to small farms, with
  their vaunted individual initiative and enterprise, supplying the immense Soviet
  economy with its 280 million people  &ndash;  that is nothing but a fantasy, a reactionary
  utopia.</p>

  <p>The socialist organization of agriculture and its liaison or coordination with
  industry can raise Soviet agriculture to the status of an industry like any other.
  Socialist ownership is what will pave the way toward the communist organization of
  society. This neobourgeois layer of economists and politicians is not attempting to
  promote the socialist reconstruction of society insofar as agriculture is concerned,
  but wants to pull it back to an earlier, outmoded bourgeois form. One would think that
  the lesson of Poland, where collectivization was long ago abolished for the most part,
  would be sufficient to show them where this leads. Small farming is the bane of the
  Polish economy. Food shortages are an ever-present phenomenon.</p>

  <p>Soviet agriculture has evolved from private farming to collectives and partially to
  state farming. The next step should be the organization of agriculture as an integrated
  industrial element of the entire socialist scientific and technological complex of the
  USSR. In fact, steps taken in the earlier era of the development of collectives into
  state farms showed a great deal of promise but were not carried forward on a mass
  scale. Attempts to discredit these efforts should be resisted. Where the amalgamation
  of collective farms into state farms was not well calculated or organized, these errors
  should not be used as a means to attack the principle of the conversion of collective
  farms into state farms. This is a step backward.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">We must finally decide once and for all what is most important to us: to have an
    abundance of food or to eternally indulge an assortment of irresponsible loudmouths
    and proponents of equality in poverty. We need to call stupidity, incompetence and
    active Stalinism by their proper names. We need to do whatever it takes to ensure an
    ample supply of foodstuffs, for without that the idea of activating the human factor
    will go nowhere.<sup><a href="#16.">16</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He equates abundance with the capitalist market. The struggle for social
  equality, for communism, he equates with poverty. All this is lumped together with
  "stupidity," "incompetence" and "Stalinism."</p>

  <p>"At one time," he says, "the elimination of the kulaks as a class was put forward as
  the motto." He then mourns the elimination of the kulaks and says that what was
  abolished was the peasant class. It is true that millions of peasants suffered as a
  result of the forced character of Stalin's collectivization, but it is a wildly gross
  exaggeration to say that the peasants were abolished. They form what became the
  industrial and rural proletariat. Would the USSR be today the second greatest world
  power without them? Crocodile tears for the peasants are in reality a cover for
  sympathy with the kulaks, who exploited and robbed the peasantry.</p>

  <p>Shmelyov treats the peasantry as one undifferentiated mass with the kulaks. He
  deliberately omits the Leninist approach to the peasantry both before and after the
  revolution. The Bolsheviks fought for all the peasants. ("Land to the peasants" was
  their slogan both before and during the revolution.) But in the socialist phase of the
  revolution, the Bolsheviks differentiated between: first, the kulaks, who by definition
  employed wage labor (that's what made them rich peasants); second, the middle peasants
  who did not employ wage labor and worked the land themselves; and third, the poor
  peasants, the landless peasants and the wage laborers on the land.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of the peasants were not kulaks and should not be confused with
  them, as Shmelyov does, as though the collectivization process with its repression
  destroyed everybody. These exaggerations only help the bourgeois interpretations of
  Soviet history.</p>

  <p>To sum up, we see that Shmelyov equates a partial return to capitalism with the
  development of socialism. He lauds the NEP policy, not for what Lenin meant it to be a
  temporary period of coexistence with capitalist commodity production  &ndash;  but rather as a
  long-term projection of socialist development. He then further equates the abolition of
  the kulaks, the exploiters of the peasantry, with the abolition of the peasantry as a
  class. Moreover, he sees abundance of food as a natural, inevitable product of the
  capitalist market, forgetting in the meantime that capitalist abundance brings
  abundance of profits at one pole and misery and poverty at the other pole. This kind of
  abundance invariably leads to capitalist overproduction and the anarchy of a capitalist
  crisis.</p>

  <p>His prescription for a retreat to small-scale agriculture even disregards the
  progress being made in the metropolitan imperialist countries. What has the
  much-vaunted free enterprise system of imperialism done to agriculture in the U.S.?
  U.S. agriculture is collectivized, but on a capitalist basis. The lion's share of the
  market is in the hands of huge agribusiness conglomerates that are organized,
  coordinated and controlled by big business, especially the huge chemical and high-tech
  industries specializing in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and the production of
  fertilizer.</p>

  <p>One authority on U.S. agriculture says, "Large and very large farms constitute less
  than 5 percent of all U.S. farms, yet account for more than half of total gross farm
  income and for more than four-fifths of net income. Indeed, the very large farms (those
  with annual gross sales of $500,000 or more), although only a bit more than 1 percent
  of all farms, account for one-third of gross farm income and more than three-fifths of
  net income." <sup><a href="#17.">17</a></sup> This tendency was pointed out by Lenin
  himself in his writings on agriculture in the U.S. Today farming is one of the best
  organized high-tech industries, but it is owned privately by the millionaires and
  billionaires. While there is splendid coordination between industry and agriculture,
  the virus that kills it all is the private ownership of the means of production and the
  predominance of the banks and the huge multinationals.</p>

  <p>Politically, these attacks from the right in the USSR are directed against
  Stalinism. Of course, Stalin is now an easy target, so it becomes all the easier to
  equate Stalinism with Leninism and communism, an argument that leads back to bourgeois
  norms in the struggle for the restructuring of the Soviet economy and back to bourgeois
  ideology. It is a broad attack against communism, and Stalin is merely a convenient
  symbol.</p>

  <p>The neobourgeoisie attack perestroika not because they are opposed to it in
  principle but because, as Shmelyov says, the reforms go only half-way toward
  capitalism. They are for accelerating the process, but they put it in the framework of
  a bourgeois economic critique of the Soviet economy. Politically, they pretend to be
  attacking only the "high-handed," "administrative," "command" strategy of earlier
  Soviet administrations. In reality, they go far, far beyond that. They go to the very
  essence of what socialism is and the perspective for the Soviet economy.</p>
