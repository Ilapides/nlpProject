  <h2>Rise of the USSR as a world power</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst"><strong>Gorky in 1921 on weakness of proletariat. Lenin restored capitalism in early
    '20s to revive working class. Workers today are majority in USSR. International
    position of USSR vastly improved. Why go back to NEP? Bourgeois hostility tempered in
    periods of U.S.-USSR detente: World War II alliance, Khrushchev, Gorbachev periods.
    Imperialism today interested in changing economic and political orientation of Soviet
    government. Trade, loans and investment. Why detente of 1970s fell apart. Big loans
    from imperialist banks conditional on broader accommodations. Summary of three
    political tendencies in USSR. Gorbachev admits reforms haven't worked. Problem is
    disruption of socialist planning. Individual vs. collective incentives. Orwellian
    view of Soviet state disproved by present disintegration of bureaucracy.</strong>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Taking any phase of economic and political development out of its
  historical context almost always does it violence or creates distortion. Thus, it is
  quite impossible to examine the period of the Gorbachev administration without
  considering the October Revolution in general, and more particularly the period of the
  New Economic Policy (NEP) which Lenin introduced in 1921. The latter has been brought
  up by the Gorbachev reformers again and again. They draw an analogy between that
  period, when Lenin won over the Party to the urgent necessity of reintroducing market
  relations in the Soviet Union, and the present. The reformers argue so vigorously for a
  new NEP that it is virtually impossible not to give it extensive consideration. We hope
  we have done so throughout this series.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, there is a singularly cogent argument almost always overlooked by the
  reformers, particularly those with strong leanings towards the capitalist market. That
  is the difference in the numerical relationship between the basic classes as they
  existed during the NEP period and as they exist today in the Soviet Union, some 65
  years later.</p>

  <p>Maxim Gorky (1868-1936), the great revolutionary novelist, writer and playwright, is
  worth quoting on this point. During the course of his entire life, Gorky was not only
  friendly to the Bolshevik grouping around Lenin but was a member of it. Frequently he
  clashed with Lenin  &ndash;  for example, on philosophical questions during the pre-October
  period. He also wavered on the question of the insurrection, but later came out in full
  support of the Soviet socialist republic. He always, however, remained somewhat
  independent and aloof and often his moods reflected pessimism in relation to the
  progress of the revolution. During the early period of the NEP, Gorky's outlook on the
  revolution and the cause of socialist construction was quite pessimistic. In the summer
  of 1921, he expressed some of his views to a French correspondent.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">Hitherto the workers are masters, but they are only a tiny minority in our country:
    they represent at most a few millions. The peasants are legion. In the struggle
    which, since the beginning of the revolution, has been going on between the two
    classes, the peasants have every chance of coming out victorious. ... The urban
    proletariat has been declining incessantly for four years. ... The immense peasant
    tide will end by engulfing everything. ... The peasant will become master of Russia,
    since he represents numbers. And it will be terrible for our future. <sup><a href=
    "#1.">1</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Gorky was merely expressing the mood that prevailed during the first
  period of the NEP, a fear that it might undo the revolution. This view was certainly
  not shared by Lenin, who on the contrary saw the NEP as an imperative necessity in
  order to save the revolution.

  <p>Let us note how Lenin viewed the same phenomenon that Gorky referred to, but from an
  entirely different light. In a speech in October 1921 on the New Economic Policy (some
  of which we have quoted earlier), Lenin said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">The issue in the present war [he called the struggle a war  &ndash;  S.M.] is  &ndash;  who will win,
    who will take advantage of the situation: the capitalist, whom we are allowing to
    come in by the door, and even by several doors (and by many doors we are not aware
    of, and which open without us, and in spite of us), or proletarian state power? ...<br /><br />

    In this connection we must remember the peasants. It is absolutely
    incontrovertible and obvious to all that in spite of the awful disaster of the famine
     &ndash;  and leaving that disaster out of the reckoning for the moment  &ndash;  the improvement
    that has taken place in the position of the people has been due to the change in our
    economic policy.<br /><br />

    On the other hand, if capitalism gains by it, industrial production will grow, and
    the proletariat will grow too. The capitalists will gain from our policy and will
    create an industrial proletariat, which in our country, owing to the war and to the
    desperate poverty and ruin, has become declassed, i.e., dislodged from its class
    groove, and has ceased to exist as a proletariat. The proletariat is the class which
    is engaged in the production of material values in large-scale capitalist industry.
    Since large-scale capitalist industry has been destroyed, since the factories are at
    a standstill, <strong>the proletariat has disappeared</strong> [our emphasis  &ndash;  S.M.].
    It has sometimes figured in statistics, but it has not been held together
    economically.<br /><br />

    The restoration of capitalism would mean the restoration of a proletarian class
    engaged in the production of socially useful material values in big factories
    employing machinery and not in profiteering, not in making cigarette lighters for
    sale, and in other `work' which is not very useful, but which is inevitable when our
    industry is in a state of ruin.<sup><a href="#2.">2</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Thus Lenin, more clearly than Gorky, saw the virtual disappearance of the
  proletariat, but he also saw in the partial restoration of capitalism a source for
  reviving the working class in order to proceed to the eventual abolition of capitalism
  and the triumph of socialism. This partial restoration of capitalism made it possible
  to go forward with the industrialization of the USSR. Without it, that might have been
  utterly impossible.</p>

  <p>But what is the situation today? Today the proletariat is not a small minority but
  has become the absolute majority of the population. It is the class that creates the
  material values. It is the class that has laid the basis for and realized the great
  technological and industrial feats exemplified by the Soviet space program, atomic
  energy and the natural gas pipeline. At the 19th Party Conference in June-July 1988,
  even though it was packed by the bureaucracy and the administrative apparatus
  generally, the majority of the delegates were workers.</p>

  <p>The proletariat is the revolutionary agent with the capacity and wherewithal to
  bring about change. In the USSR today, there is adequate science and technology for the
  building and perfection of a socialist order of society. Why should it be necessary to
  go back to a capitalist emergency measure taken in the 1920s? Can it be justified on
  the basis of the exigencies of the international situation? Is that so unfavorable as
  to make it incumbent on the USSR to make vast domestic concessions of a bourgeois
  character?</p>

  <p>Such a view is utterly inadmissible. During the NEP period, the Soviet Union was
  surrounded by capitalist powers, some of whom were still carrying out war and
  intervention against it. It was completely isolated in the sense that no proletarian
  revolution in the West had succeeded, and in the East the potentials were still
  emerging. Indeed, the USSR was a besieged fortress at the time.</p>

  <p>Can this be said to be true today? Merely raising the question is to answer it.
  There are now a number of socialist countries. Whatever their problems may be, and many
  are very severe, the USSR can in no sense be regarded as an isolated fortress
  struggling for its existence. This is true not just militarily but also from the
  viewpoint of diplomacy and economics.</p>

  <p>After all is said and done, the 20th century has been in the main dominated by the
  emergence of the Soviet Union as a great world power. Just as significant  &ndash;  and maybe
  more important in the long view of history  &ndash;  is the rise of a revolutionary
  working-class wave as a challenge to the world capitalist system. Along with it and in
  part flowing from it has been the awakening of millions upon millions of oppressed
  peoples living under the yoke of imperialist domination. This subsequently gave rise to
  such phenomena as, for instance, the Chinese Revolution, the Cuban Revolution, the
  revolutions in southeast Asia  &ndash;  Vietnam, Laos, Kampuchea  &ndash;  as well as the revolution
  which gave birth to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Much of Africa was
  eventually to rise up. Central America is today convulsed with struggle.</p>

  <p>The socialist revolution in the USSR gave impetus to the oppressed peoples
  struggling to free themselves from colonial domination. Indeed, there is no spot on
  earth which in one way or another has not been touched by the sparks generated by the
  Russian Revolution. So it would be preposterous to say that the international situation
  today demands a return to capitalist market relations in the USSR.</p>

  <p>When Gorbachev was elected general secretary of the CPSU in March of 1985, the
  imperialist press at first took a very cautious attitude. It was almost universally
  recognized that a break in the chain of political development had taken place. To a
  large extent it was recognized that a new generation of leaders was moving into the
  summits of Soviet power. Of course, a generational change need not necessarily connote
  a deep social or political change. Older leaders can supplant younger leaders and vice
  versa. It may accelerate development or retard it, bring innovative practices or a
  return to older ways.</p>

  <p>Immediately following the death of the previous general secretary, Constantine
  Chernenko, there began the usual speculation in the imperialist press, and especially
  in the U.S., as to who would succeed him. Such "old hands" as Harrison Salisbury, who
  had spent many years in the USSR, predicted that Andrei Gromyko, the long-time Soviet
  foreign minister, would be the natural choice. Others had different choices, equally
  erroneous. Only one researcher, Jerry Hough, author of the book <em>Opening up the
  Soviet Economy</em>, predicted correctly that it would be Gorbachev.</p>

  <p>The capitalist press, which had taken a cautious view, began to build up momentum to
  put Gorbachev in a favorable light. Margaret Thatcher had started it most publicly with
  her "I like him" statement when he visited England. Slowly and gradually, praise for
  Gorbachev's style, his demeanor with respect to the West, and finally his political and
  economic program began to proliferate in the capitalist press.</p>

  <p>For over 70 years, the attitude of the bourgeoisie toward the Soviet Union and its
  leaders has been one of class hatred and opposition. But it has gone from the wildest
  orgies of anti-communism to times here and there when it was expedient to drop the
  unbridled attacks and take a more cautious and pragmatic view.</p>

  <p>During the Bolshevik period, the hatred of the capitalist class for the Soviet
  leaders was unmitigated. It was directed against Lenin as well as Trotsky and Stalin.
  However, it is interesting to note that during the period when the struggle between
  Stalin and Trotsky was reaching its denouement and Stalin was consolidating his power,
  that is, before the collectivization of agriculture began, the capitalist press for the
  moment regarded Stalin in a more favorable light than Trotsky. He was seen as more
  pragmatic, more practical. Trotsky, the proponent of world revolution, was castigated
  for adventurism. However, when the factional struggle ended and Stalin embarked upon
  the vast collectivization of the peasantry, with all its dire consequences, the
  capitalist press turned wildly against him. Notwithstanding all the twists and turns of
  Soviet diplomacy during the entire tenure of Stalin's office, the press maintained the
  hostility which its class role dictates.</p>

  <p>Of course, there have been short periods of moderation. One was the years of the
  Second World War. The imperialist Allies were in it together with the USSR. The
  imperialist bourgeoisie had to orient itself into a collaborative position,
  necessitating a change in the tenor of its propaganda. Later, during the Khrushchev
  era, some elements of the bourgeoisie looked upon him more benevolently and held him up
  as a liberalizer of the regime who was willing to arrive at an accommodation with the
  West. At no time, however, was he ever regarded in the same favorable light as is the
  Gorbachev regime at the present time.</p>

  <p>The diplomatic and political relationship between the U.S. and the USSR has now
  again undergone significant changes. For a considerable period, particularly during the
  19th Party Conference in June-July 1988, elements of the capitalist press and media and
  especially some of its liberal specialists have waxed eloquent over the openness in the
  USSR and Gorbachev's innovative economic reforms. There was the signing of the INF
  treaty on nuclear weapons, and also a variety of exchanges of scholars, scientists, and
  even military leaders. The defense minister of the USSR was permitted to visit nuclear
  missile sites in the U.S. and was taken into the cockpit of a B-1 bomber. Then U.S.
  Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci received the same treatment when he went to the
  USSR. This attests to a new relationship, for the time being at least.</p>

  <p>What accounts for the favorable treatment that the Gorbachev administration is
  receiving in the U.S. and in the world bourgeois press at this time? Some say it is
  merely the result of the period of openness, known as glasnost. The democratization
  aspects of the reform are universally regarded as progressive. It would be very
  difficult for the imperialists to act otherwise. We have covered the democratization
  aspect of the political process. It has brought an invigorating element into Soviet
  society and is beyond question an indispensable element in the further development of
  socialism, which in fact is inconceivable without proletarian democracy.</p>

  <p>During the entire Leninist period there was full-scale socialist democracy, but it
  never got any praise in the bourgeois press. There was broad freedom for the bourgeois
  parties as well, until they resorted to terrorism, to the attempted assassination of
  Lenin and a coup d'etat as well as a counter-revolutionary insurrection  &ndash;  not to speak
  of their support for open military intervention by the imperialist powers. The fact
  that later a severe restriction of political freedoms occurred, followed by the
  abolition of proletarian democracy, must first of all be seen in the historical
  character of the epoch. The imperialist bourgeoisie was intransigent in its attempt to
  overthrow the young socialist republic and allied itself with all the leftovers of the
  reactionary propertied classes. This is not to excuse Stalin's repressions, but his
  unlimited use of terror during the entire period of his tenure didn't just fall from
  the sky; it had a material basis.</p>

  <p>Thus, today's democratization process should be explained as a resumption of what
  normally would have been a continuous development of socialist democracy under the
  proletarian dictatorship. While all hail the democratization process, in the West as
  well as in the Soviet Union, it is not really the democratization process as such that
  the bourgeoisie is so much concerned with, as we will show. What they're most concerned
  with is the economic and political orientation of the government itself and most of all
  the perspective of the economic reforms.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev administration led off its program by embarking upon what is now
  popularly called perestroika, meaning a thorough restructuring of the USSR. Precisely
  what does this mean? Does it entail mostly accelerating the pace of change in the
  technological apparatus of the USSR? Does it entail merely catching up with the West in
  technical and scientific progress? Does it entail overhauling what is said to be an
  outdated scientific and technological apparatus? Is that what it reduces itself to? If
  that is the case, why would the Western capitalist press be so favorably concerned with
  it? The Soviet Union has become the second greatest industrial power in the world. It
  is ahead in several scientific fields of endeavor, including space. Why would the
  capitalist class be concerned with the success of its technological overhaul, with
  making the USSR stronger technologically and modernizing its industry? Is that not
  against the fundamental class interests of imperialism?</p>

  <p>For well over 60 years, the imperialist ruling class has been most hostile toward
  the transfer of any type of technology to the Soviet Union, not just military. True,
  the capitalist class will sell even the rope used to hang them, as Lenin said.
  Nevertheless, viewed over a period of decades, one can see how little help the
  capitalists have been in the modernization of the Soviet technological apparatus. Most
  of the trade has consisted in selling the USSR grain and buying from it gas and oil. It
  is true that the strategic interests of the imperialist bourgeoisie would dictate a
  total boycott rather than any trade, but they are constrained by their own avaricious
  and predatory chase for super-profits. That has compelled the imperialist bourgeoisie
  to deal with the USSR in trade and the sale of some technology.</p>

  <p>Their present interest in the modernization of the Soviet Union does not lie in
  enthusiasm for the reequipment of its technological infrastructure. What they're really
  interested in is whether the reforms will facilitate the penetration of finance capital
  on a huge scale. They are probing the increased opportunity for the big multinational
  superbanks to lend vast sums of money to the USSR, either as part of trade or in
  connection with the sale of some technology. It is said that the Soviet Union now
  offers the greatest market in the world for banks and industry from the West. They call
  it a three-trillion-dollar economy, while the U.S. has a four-trillion-dollar
  economy.</p>

  <p>The role of the banks as lenders of funds to the socialist countries has to be seen
  from two different points of view. So far as the lender is concerned, the payment of
  interest and/or part of the principal on time is the main concern. If a country is
  credit-worthy and can make its payments on time, there is no danger. A problem arises
  only if there is a financial or economic crisis in the capitalist countries which makes
  it necessary to liquidate their loans and cover their own obligations or makes it
  difficult for them to extend further credit or reschedule or readjust the existing
  obligations.</p>

  <p>Relations between the imperialist banks and many of the less-developed countries
  illustrate the magnitude of the problem, however. In some cases amounting to billions,
  imperialist banks have been forced to reschedule the loans, perhaps write off the debt
  altogether, and at other times make cooperative agreements with other banks and debtors
  on how to reach a new accommodation in the light of the economic crisis.</p>

  <p>However, capital import could be just as advantageous for the socialist countries as
  it was for the U.S. when for many decades the latter was a capital importer. In fact,
  the U.S. was a debtor country all the way up to the First World War. In those days,
  however, the loans were incurred to finance an enormous expansion of the economic
  infrastructure. The present huge indebtedness of the U.S. is the result of the
  degeneration of monopoly capital rather than its expansion. When considered in the
  light of today's advances in technology and the worldwide restructuring of industry
  going on, this huge indebtedness becomes even more symptomatic of decay.</p>

  <p>The crisis within the capitalist monopoly banks is only one problem. Extending large
  loans to a socialist country is for them a very incongruous situation. As experience
  has shown with the loans to Poland, Hungary and above all China, they extend them
  either prior to or in connection with a rearrangement of economic, diplomatic and
  political relations. <strong>They look for political advantages and levers to control
  the economy, not just through loans but through joint ventures and other
  arrangements.</strong> But in the USSR these investments have not been of the magnitude
  to lead to broad collaboration, even with the Gorbachev regime. So that under the
  present circumstances it is still touch and go. Thus, while the value of the Soviet
  market is inestimable, the loans that have thus far been extended are negligible by the
  standards of the Soviet economy. Ten, fifteen or even twenty-five billion dollars is
  small when one considers the vast technological and industrial capacity of the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>True, the USSR has proven that, in the jargon of the bankers, it is a very
  credit-worthy debtor. Its rating is excellent. No wonder that imperialist banks are
  forever chasing the USSR to take out loans, and every other plane landing in the USSR
  has one or two bankers aboard it. But truly expansive lending to the USSR is
  prohibited, either directly by law, which usually cites national security, or by an
  understanding within the capitalist ruling class.</p>

  <p>So that the loans many Wall Street bankers are waxing enthusiastic about are in
  expectation of further acceleration of so-called innovative, free enterprise reforms in
  the USSR. Joint ventures are expected to be a fundamental lever for imperialist
  penetration.</p>

  <p>They are not exactly a new endeavor in the USSR. During Lenin's time, the Soviet
  government eagerly sought joint ventures or outright imperialist investment by banks
  and industries. These did not avail themselves of the opportunities offered. On a very
  meager scale, this was also attempted during the Stalin period. It was resumed during
  the Khrushchev period, and in the early 1970s Pepsi-Cola signed a contract with the
  Soviet government, followed by other multinationals. As the Wall Street Journal
  commented: "Indeed, for a while it seemed [the 1970s] could be the decade of the
  Americans." <sup><a href="#3.">3</a></sup> These joint ventures and business agreements
  seemed considerable. Such companies as International Harvester, Crowell-Collier,
  Macmillan, Kaiser Industries, Upjohn, General Electric, Philip Morris, Control Data,
  General Dynamics, PTG, Swindell-Dressler, NBC, the American Foreign Insurance
  Association, ITT, Arthur Andersen, and Bechtel (the giant multinational engineering and
  construction company) signed agreements of intent. Eventually, however, it all fell
  apart. Why?</p>

  <p>In our view, there was no political agreement on the propriety of opening up the
  USSR to the penetration of U.S. finance capital on a massive scale in return for
  political and economic leverage. On both sides of the class barricade, so to speak, it
  became unviable. Unquestionably, the struggle between the so-called conservatives and
  the reformers made it impossible for the U.S. and other capitalist countries to get the
  kinds of agreements that would satisfy both the needs of the reformers and the ruling
  imperialist circles in the U.S. Detente in the political and diplomatic sense was
  abandoned by the U.S. in the interest of embarking on a vast militarization, especially
  following the collapse of the U.S. adventure in Vietnam.</p>

  <p>There were reasons in both social systems why it was destined to fail. However, most
  important was that the leadership in the USSR at that time took a dim view of the
  presence of international monopolies and saw them as a political hazard. This should be
  taken into account in evaluating the course pursued at the present time by the
  Gorbachev administration.</p>

  <p>At the present time, the surge of U.S. capital investment into the USSR that began
  early in 1987 continues but is slowing down. However, its future depends upon the
  further development of political accommodation, on the so-called new relationship
  between the U.S. and the USSR and between imperialism and the socialist countries as a
  whole. This, of course, is the meaning of the new strategic relationship, particularly
  the military relationship, between the U.S. and the USSR.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev administration has opened up an arena for political struggle which has
  long been undercover but has now come to the surface. There are three easily
  identifiable political currents. One of them is the Shmelyov tendency. These are
  outright bourgeois reformers, like the economist Nikolai Shmelyov, who are clamoring
  for the opening of the capitalist market on a wide arena. Of that there can be no
  doubt. They are strong proponents of joint ventures and the strengthening of what they
  call economic cooperation with the West, meaning more and more inducements for foreign
  capital to enter the USSR.</p>

  <p>Shmelyov, in the article we referred to earlier in the June 1987 issue of Novy Mir,
  advocated unemployment as a "medicine to cure sloth and drunkenness," the establishment
  of free economic zones for foreign capital, organizing the economy "on a totally
  bottom-line basis" by raising the prices of food and housing, and relying on profit as
  the measure of economic activity.</p>

  <p>This grouping looks forward to a convertible Soviet ruble, but until such becomes
  possible, they are for making all sorts of inducements so that foreign currencies  &ndash;  the
  dollar, the deutschmark, the yen, the pound, the franc  &ndash;  can be legally convertible in
  the USSR. They are, needless to say, strong supporters of accommodation with the U.S.
  Some of them, like Zhores Medvedev, are open admirers of U.S. imperialist statesmen
  like President Kennedy and even of Reagan. When Reagan met with Soviet journalists, as
  a sort of counterpart to Gorbachev having met with U.S. journalists, Medvedev's opinion
  was that Reagan won the debate with the Soviet journalists! Reagan's performance was
  actually considered so poor by the U.S. media that it was barely covered by them.</p>

  <p>These reformers are not opposed (openly) to public ownership of the means of
  production as long as there is a free, bourgeois market, as long as individual material
  incentives and bourgeois norms for decentralization of industry are strengthened and
  agriculture is decollectivized. That's as far as bourgeois reformers can go at this
  time in the Soviet Union. Those who stand for a full-scale restoration of capitalism
  are too insignificant a minority. The real extremist and counterrevolutionary elements,
  like the writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn who now lives in Vermont, offer little hope to
  the imperialists.</p>

  <p>At the other end of the spectrum are the forces presumably coalesced to some extent
  around Yegor Ligachev, a member of the Politburo and secretary of the CPSU Central
  Committee. He is more representative of those called "conservative," in the sense that
  they would conserve the socialized, centralized economy and are opposed to the opening
  up of the capitalist market and the extension of privileges to imperialist monopolies.
  Most of all, they act as a brake on the Gorbachev reforms. To get a view of their
  position is more difficult, since most of them are Party members high in the hierarchy
  of the Soviet political structure. But a general idea of where they stand was given by
  Ligachev to a meeting of the Gorky Province Party organization, excerpts of which were
  reprinted in Pravda on August 6, 1988.</p>

  <p>In his remarks, he endorsed using "all the best things that have been accumulated
  through the historical experience of organizing exchange and the market." But he
  cautioned that "copying the Western model of the market, which is based on private
  property, is fundamentally unacceptable for the socialist system of economic
  management, the foundation of which is public property."</p>

  <p>"It is impermissible to forget," continued Ligachev, "that the capitalist market,
  after all, is not just a market for goods and capital. An integral part of this model
  is the manpower market, with its merciless laws and chronic unemployment. One cannot
  help seeing that market relations are inevitably accompanied in capitalist society by
  deep social stratification, the deepening of inequality and the concentration of wealth
  in the hands of a small segment of society. Should we really reproduce all this in our
  own country?" <sup><a href="#4.">4</a></sup></p>

  <p>It must be remembered that everything Ligachev says has to be within the framework
  of supporting the restructuring and the general policies of the Gorbachev
  administration. He and the others are constrained to do so on the basis of Party
  discipline. It is otherwise with Shmelyov, who represents more the nonparty groupings
  and can speak more freely, as witness his article in Novy Mir. Rather than speak out
  openly with a definitive program, the conservatives hide behind acceptance of the
  general line, and that in turn weakens their position. Of course, they are regarded as
  conservative also in the sense that they want to conserve a great deal of the Stalin
  legacy, but are caught in a trap since they have all been obliged to denounce it.</p>

  <p>At the present time, three years after the reforms began, Gorbachev is admitting
  that they have come to a virtual standstill. "We are going slowly, we are losing time,
  this means we are losing the game," Gorbachev told a group of Soviet editors. "In a
  word, it turns out there is a gap between our goals and our work." <sup><a href=
  "#5.">5</a></sup> He blamed the Soviet press and media, whose assertions are
  nonetheless true. "In some speeches and publications, you almost get the idea that
  restructuring has aggravated the economic situation, thrown finances out of balance,
  worsened supplies of food and goods and sharpened housing and other social problems,"
  he said. The fact of the matter is that the democratization process, glasnost, has made
  it possible for each of the factional groupings to take advantage of the continuing
  failure of the restructuring process.</p>

  <p>What is the cause of the aggravated economic situation, of the financial imbalance
  and growth of inflation? What lies behind the worsened supplies of food and goods and
  sharpening problems in housing and other social areas? The fundamental cause is the
  disruption of socialist planning. What do self-financing and accounting, catchwords of
  the reforms, mean except a throwback to individual gain at the expense of the general
  welfare of the socialist economy? There is an attempt to deepen individual
  acquisitiveness and open up, even if partially and spasmodically, elements of the
  capitalist market, to decentralize the economy by encouraging the perilous trend toward
  more and more autonomy for managers of the industrial enterprises, which could
  ultimately undo socialist planning altogether.</p>

  <p>When Gorbachev took over as general secretary, he had a choice: go along with prior
  administrations by deepening social inequality and fostering material incentives and
  individual acquisitiveness at the expense of collective solidarity, or reopen the
  Leninist struggle for socialist collaboration on the basis of moving in the direction
  of social equality. The problem all along has been how best to abolish the social
  classes in the struggle for communism. Gorbachev chose the road of deepening and
  widening social differentiation in the Soviet Union. Zhores Medvedev says Gorbachev
  champions the better-paid workers as against the lesser-paid. Unfortunately, this is
  all too true. This inevitably leads to a weakening of the socialist economy.</p>

  <p>After three years, his restructuring reforms have slowed the economy and not
  accelerated it. By contrast, three years into the first five-year plan (1929-1933), it
  proved so successful that Stalin turned it into a four-year plan, precisely because it
  had largely met its targets already. Were bureaucracy and repression responsible for
  the success of the economic plans throughout that period, or was it the principle of
  socialist planning and the solidarity of the workers, whose enthusiasm and eagerness
  carried the economy forward in spite of the repression?</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev restructuring has met with little enthusiasm from the broad masses.
  The enthusiastic ones are the self-seekers, those who see gain for themselves as
  against the collective.</p>

  <p>It is easy to reawaken and stimulate personal incentive as against the collective.
  Every worker knows that. Think what happens in the U.S. today with lotteries. Doesn't
  every worker know that this means billions taken away from them just so a few will get
  an advantage? The struggle for socialism has to overcome the age-old trap in which
  private property pits the individual against the collective of the mass of workers. The
  Gorbachev program for developing and accelerating the economy is to deepen bourgeois
  individual incentives, which Marxism recognized a long time ago as necessary for a
  period of time but which socialism aspires to overcome, not to perpetuate.</p>

  <p>Marxism doesn't deny the significance of material incentives. On the contrary, it
  recognizes them. But it also shows that the collective effort of the workers will in
  the long run redound to the benefit of all the individuals involved.</p>

  <p>Marxism does not establish an antagonism between the individual and the collective.
  It merely tries to abolish the material basis for the antagonism which capitalism and
  private property have fostered all these many centuries. The capitalists seek to divide
  the instinctive solidarity of the masses and replace it with bourgeois individual
  acquisitiveness, which ends up in the exploitation of the overwhelming majority of the
  masses in the interests of a few exploiters, as capitalism has shown.</p>

  <p>Three years is plenty of time in which to prove a policy bankrupt. The question is
  how long it will take to reverse it. But we have seen historic reversals in the Soviet
  Union before. We have seen how during the Stalin period the bourgeois theoreticians
  were convinced that socialism was rapidly becoming a thoroughgoing totalitarian state
  which would sweep the world, which would be autocratic, tyrannical, and without any
  shred of democracy  &ndash;  and therefore a danger to humanity. This Orwellian conception of
  socialism became so popular that it was embraced by large sections of the intellectuals
  and even the radical petty bourgeoisie. No one knew where the Stalin cult would
  ultimately lead.</p>

  <p>But what does the present Gorbachev era show? Instead of the stultification and
  ossification of political life in the USSR, instead of the bureaucracy becoming more
  omnipotent, it is in reality disintegrating. It is giving way to democratic processes.
  It is splitting up into groupings and factions, letting fresh air ventilate the
  system.</p>

  <p>Of course, the democratization is still limited. It is still democracy exercised in
  the main by and for the bureaucracy. But in its divisions and rifts, the bureaucracy is
  forced more and more to appeal to the mass of the workers on the basis of their class
  interests. This is the meaning of the split, to the extent that it can openly exist,
  between the so-called conservative forces epitomized by Ligachev, the classical
  centrist grouping around Gorbachev and the more outlandish bourgeois reformers of the
  Shmelyov type.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Gorbachev reforms come at a time when the attempt of the Reagan
  administration to regain worldwide geopolitical hegemony by means of military might is
  sinking in a sea of revolutionary conflagrations, from Haiti to the Philippines, from
  south Korea to South Africa, from Central America to the Middle East. This explains the
  accommodative stance of the U.S. ruling class at this time. Once again, as in the
  1970s, they have been forced to resort to detente, the so-called new relationship, as
  an instrument of foreign policy in relation to the USSR and other socialist countries.
  However, it is just another phase in the worldwide struggle between the two
  antagonistic social systems, imperialism and the socialist countries. The one great
  certainty is the advance of the cause of the socialist revolution. All else is
  temporary, conditional and most of all illusory.</p>
