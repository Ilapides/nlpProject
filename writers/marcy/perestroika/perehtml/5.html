  <p>In bourgeois accounts, the period in Soviet history from the end
  of World War II until the death of Stalin is made to appear as just one long night of
  repression and terror. There is no denying, of course, the use of repression. But this
  view excludes any consideration of social and economic development during that
  period.</p>

  <p>In comparing the two antagonistic social systems, particularly the U.S.
  versus the Soviet Union, the bourgeois ideologists and economists almost always define
  the fundamental issue as the level of consumer goods. They inevitably refer to
  capitalism as being based on consumer demand. The consumer is king and decides
  everything. They contrast this very sharply with the Soviet system, which they say is
  almost exclusively based not on consumer demand but on heavy industry, to the great
  detriment of the consumer. While Soviet society continues to have a shortage of
  consumer goods both in quality and quantity, this is precisely what the capitalist
  countries excel in, they say. (Never mentioned, of course, is that over the last three
  decades the imperialist countries, particularly the U.S., have enjoyed an abundance of
  cheap consumer goods which in part or in whole are produced in some of the most
  oppressed countries.)</p>

  <p>They then equate the abundance of consumer goods in the capitalist countries
  with democracy, freedom of the individual and so on. On the other hand, they contend,
  the emphasis on heavy industry in the USSR makes it anti-consumer and explains why the
  USSR supposedly is aggressive and tends toward militarism. In one way or another, that
  is the theme of the bourgeois economists, ideologists and apologists. They have a
  convenient loss of memory with regard to capitalist abundance, forgetting that it is
  the result of capitalist overproduction, which leads to capitalist crisis, poverty and
  unemployment. This bourgeois explanation creates a sort of Chinese wall between the
  means of production and consumption. There is not the slightest hint that light
  industry in the production of consumer goods is the product of the prior development of
  heavy industry. Look at the British coal industry. It was first developed in the 1500s,
  but it took centuries for workers to be able to get the benefits of it in home
  furnaces.</p>

  <p><strong>It should not be denied that there has been an historic disparity in the
  production of consumer goods between the Soviet Union and the capitalist West,
  especially the most developed countries like the U.S., Japan and Germany. This
  disparity was considerably narrowed, however, after the first five-year plan in 1929
  and all the way up to June 21, 1941, when the Nazis began their assault upon the
  USSR.</strong></p>

  <p>Of course, it's now too well known to be denied that the USSR lost about 20
  million people during the war. But this is generally referred to in the category of the
  human costs of the war. What is left to footnotes is the economic effect that these
  vast human casualties had in the USSR in contrast to what happened in the capitalist
  West. This is very important, not only so far as Soviet production in general is
  concerned, but most particularly in the production of consumer goods, for it helps us
  to understand the economic development of the USSR, including the present economic
  restructuring plans.</p>

  <p>Take, for instance, the demobilization plans of the various armed forces at
  the end of the war. The problem in the U.S. and the European capitalist countries was
  how to absorb the millions of veterans and reintegrate them into the workforce. From
  the point of view of the conversion to a so-called peacetime economy, the problem once
  again was unemployment, even for veterans &ndash; except those protected by union contracts
  and some semblance of law.</p>

  <p>But what was it like in the USSR immediately after the war? Instead of
  having millions of excess worker-veterans returning, <strong>a whole layer of society,
  20 million workers and peasants, had been torn away</strong>. A mighty economic force
  had thus been wiped out. These included men and women, both skilled and unskilled.
  Those who were killed were generally younger, which left an older population to tend to
  industry and agriculture. The USSR was deprived of a tremendous source of labor power,
  most particularly among the young on whom future generations generally rely. This set
  the USSR far behind the U.S., which had suffered no destruction at home and had lost
  400,000 troops, or about one-fiftieth of the Soviet war dead. As soon as the war ended,
  the U.S. was able to begin the production of consumer goods. These had been scarce
  during the war, but not nearly as scarce as in the USSR, which suffered the full-scale
  invasion of the Nazi armies.</p>

  <p>The problem in the USSR was therefore first, judged again from an economic view, to
  return the economy to the pre-war level of 1941, which was not a problem in the U.S.
  Even the European capitalist countries, although they all suffered severe damage and
  destruction in the war, were able to raise the level of production of heavy industry
  and were quickly aided in the acquisition of consumer goods.</p>

  <p>It should also be noted in connection with the destruction of industry that the U.S.
  and British bombing of targets in Germany was generally of a selective character, with
  a view to postwar hegemony and collaboration with Germany as a capitalist country
  (notwithstanding the barbarous destruction of Dresden, which they feared would be
  liberated by the Red Army). The Nazis, on the other hand, in their drive against the
  Soviet Union wantonly and indiscriminately destroyed everything in sight that was not
  immediately useful to them for military purposes.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the internal functioning of the capitalist economies in Western Europe
  that led to their speedy recovery. It was the development of the Marshall Plan, by
  which the U.S. poured in between $16 billion and $20 billion to resuscitate European
  capitalism, first of all helping to rehabilitate the battered standard of living and
  avoid proletarian revolution. Even before the war was in full swing, the U.S. in 1941
  had passed the Lend-Lease Act, which granted military credits to Britain but also
  included consumer goods. Also not to be underestimated was the widely publicized
  campaign "Bundles to Britain," which sent aid during the Nazi Luftwaffe attacks.</p>

  <p>So we see that the disparity between the capitalist countries and the USSR was
  widened, particularly in the area of consumer goods, first, because the U.S. quickly
  came to the aid of capitalist Europe and second, but just as importantly, because the
  U.S. failed to respond to Soviet requests for credit and trade on an equal basis. The
  Soviet government had hoped to begin peaceful reconversion plans so as to restore and
  raise the consumption level of the people, but this could not be done. U.S.
  imperialism, however, was only too anxious to aid a rapid recovery of the capitalist
  system in Europe and above all to militarily surround the USSR. Had the imperialist
  West confined itself to merely rehabilitating capitalist Europe and allowed the USSR to
  freely proceed with its own restoration and conversion plans based on socialist
  planning, there's no saying but that the economic balance between the buildup of heavy
  industries as against consumer goods might have been altogether different.</p>

  <p>The big question was whether the USSR should concentrate so much on building heavy
  industry. The Soviet government itself published a study urging a balanced proportion
  of the economic sectors. But the very year the war ended, the U.S. threw a monkey
  wrench into any kind of plan for a balanced economy in the USSR. The atomic bombing of
  Hiroshima and Nagasaki forced a shift back toward giving higher priority to the heavy
  industries, to the development of manufacturing and technology for purposes
  particularly related to the defense industry.</p>

  <p>Some of the revisionist historians in the West (so-called because they revised the
  bitterly anti-Soviet Cold War interpretation of post-war events) have come around to
  the point of view that the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was unnecessary. In
  the light of the surrender of Nazi Germany and the military advances made by the USSR,
  it was entirely impossible for the Japanese militarists to continue the war. Some have
  flatly said it was an effort to thwart the Red Army's advance and to quickly be in a
  position to occupy Japan. The dropping of the atomic bomb undoubtedly moved the USSR to
  further strengthen its technological and economic base and give more emphasis to heavy
  industry. But this decision was also greatly influenced by the reemergence in the West
  of the old anti-Soviet class hatred on the part of imperialism in the political as well
  as the diplomatic and military fields.</p>

  <p>Even before the war was over, and just immediately after the tremendous Soviet
  victories at Stalingrad early in 1943 and in the Kursk area, there was a perceptible
  change in the tone of the capitalist press reports on the Soviet Union. The mass of the
  people still retained much admiration and tremendous goodwill for the Soviet Union and
  its struggle against the Nazis, but the U.S. military leaders feared that these
  successes foreshadowed the reconstruction of the USSR into a tremendous economic,
  political and military force.</p>

  <p>Here's a Soviet account of the military and industrial strength that emerged during
  that period of the war:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">The Soviet Air Force caused great losses to German fascist aircraft in the
    counter-attack at Stalingrad, and then at Kursk it firmly seized and held control of
    the sky along the entire Soviet-German front until the end of the war. This
    domination of the air made it possible for the ground forces to conduct offensive
    operations simultaneously in several sectors.<br /><br />

    The self-sacrificing labors of the Soviet people in the rear contributed
    significantly to Soviet Army successes at the front. In 1943 our industry produced
    34,000 aircraft, and 40,000 in 1944. This greatly increased the aircraft reserves at
    the front; both a quantitative and a qualitative superiority over the enemy was
    achieved in aircraft technology.<sup><a href="#1.">1</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>The U.S. government, and particularly the military leaders, while publicly
  expressing admiration for this great effort and according high praise to the USSR,
  nevertheless were frightened and awed by both the military and industrial capacity of
  the Soviet productive forces, particularly in producing delicate instrumentation, such
  as in aircraft and later on in missiles. From this it followed that they would rather
  hinder than help Soviet reconstruction. The urgency to develop high technology under
  conditions of war and scarcity all the more emphasized the shift towards the heavy
  industries.</p>

  <p>After 1945, the U.S. wanted to restore the pre-war status in Eastern Europe, but
  under its own hegemony. The campaign began with a venom which startled the broad public
  in the Western capitalist countries and in particular in the U.S., where it had been
  taken for granted that the alliance between the USSR and the capitalist "democracies"
  would continue in peacetime in the form of economic cooperation, as well as the pursuit
  of peaceful foreign policies. But this was not to be. The U.S. in particular began its
  campaign of "rolling back the red carpet." It was anxious to restore the pre-war
  regimes in Eastern Europe, which included some of the most reactionary monarchist
  elements. The campaign for "democracy and freedom" with the forces that the
  imperialists had at their disposal was very much akin to the kind of democracy, the
  kind of freedom fighters, that the U.S. today supports in Nicaragua and in El Salvador.
  But that was not all. Together with Britain, the U.S. also demanded that the USSR repay
  the lend-lease war loans, and even old czarist debts from World War I. It was all the
  beginning of a violent anti-Soviet campaign which became menacing on the European
  continent with the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
  August 1949. What gave them pause, however, in the drive for the "liberation" of
  Eastern Europe, was of course the USSR's explosion of an atomic bomb.</p>

  <p>Thus the international situation least of all commended itself to any easy narrowing
  of the disparity in the USSR between consumer production and the priority on heavy
  industries, which were urgently needed in the face of possible U.S. aggression. The
  development of atomic energy had of necessity to be as speedy as possible, and while it
  of course added to energy production, it nevertheless again emphasized the primacy of
  the basic means of production. The Soviet public was learning about the McCarthy period
  in this country and could not have viewed it with equanimity so far as the peaceful
  intentions of the U.S. were concerned. On the contrary, the transition to peacetime
  objectives was made more unfavorable in the USSR.</p>

  <p>However, the most dangerous aspect came on the mainland of Asia as a result of the
  1950-53 Korean War, which was instigated and prepared by the U.S. The Korean War
  eclipsed for a period of time the transition to a peacetime economy, preventing an easy
  demobilization of USSR military forces. Although no real peace treaty was ever signed,
  from a practical point of view the Korean War virtually terminated and a cease-fire was
  declared. Nevertheless, the U.S. keeps 42,000 troops stationed there under a so-called
  UN Command, with a U.S. commander, and many cease-fire violations have occurred over
  the years.</p>

  <p>By 1953, the Korean War was winding down, the Chinese Revolution had strengthened
  the international position of the USSR and, notwithstanding all its difficulties, the
  situation had economically ripened for a forward step in improving the agricultural
  situation. This opened up greater opportunities for a better balance between the
  development of heavy industries and consumer goods in order to raise the standard of
  living of the mass of the people. We are obliged to put all this in the popular concept
  of the West, that is, consumer goods versus production of the heavy industries, as a
  sort of shorthand way of explaining the related problems in the USSR of socialist
  production, distribution and consumption.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately after Stalin's death in 1953 the new leadership started a program
  to balance light and heavy industry, particularly as this applied to agriculture and
  food production. In varying degrees this struggle to create a better balance has
  continued until this day; the Gorbachev report on economic reorganization given to the
  27th Party Congress in June 1987 says it will be given a top priority. Except for the
  period of the early 1950s, the tendency has been to put greater emphasis on the
  production of consumer goods and particularly on agriculture.</p>

  <p>The worst havoc during World War II in terms of the economic well-being of the
  Soviet people had been to the food supply. The majority of the population were still
  peasants or from rural areas. In the Ukraine and other areas invaded by the Nazis the
  destruction temporarily halted cultivation of the land. All this is well known in the
  USSR but is not well understood by the U.S. public, precisely because of the very
  tendentious way in which the capitalist press and its ideologues explain that period of
  Soviet history.</p>

  <p>One of the first things the Soviet government did under Khrushchev was set forth a
  plan to increase agricultural production. As early as September 1953, in his report to
  the Central Committee, Khrushchev called attention to the seriousness of the
  agricultural situation and proposed a number of measures to raise food production. (For
  the time being, we are leaving aside the question of material incentives and
  remuneration, which we will discuss in a later article.)</p>

  <p>Khrushchev introduced the so-called virgin lands program, which was calculated to
  speed up agricultural production and thereby raise the food supply and the standard of
  living. The areas of new cultivation included not only western Siberia but also
  northern Kazakhstan. The proposal was meant to accelerate grain production and required
  the transfer of equipment and personnel and more capital investment to agriculture.
  While it seemed to be a move away from the priority on heavy industry, here again, as
  in earlier developments, this didn't happen.</p>

  <p>First of all, the virgin lands program was dependent on weather conditions in areas
  where the climate was only marginally favorable and subject to drought. It turned out
  to be only a limited success. Bourgeois criticism should not be taken too seriously,
  but criticism within the USSR is another matter.</p>
