  <h5>Article 13<br />
  August 11, 1988</h5>

  <h2>Gorbachev's response to the crisis over Nagorno-Karabakh</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>Imperialists tilt toward Armenia, criticize Gorbachev's decision on
    Nagorno-Karabakh. USSR Constitution on boundary changes. How the Caucasus republics
    were formed. Gorbachev blames "irresponsible nationalist elements." Absolves Moscow
    leadership and the economic reforms. The Leninist view of national chauvinism. How
    1920s reforms stimulated regional and ethnic antagonisms. Party resolution of 1923 on
    Great Russian chauvinism and the NEP.</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For many months now the capitalist press in the U.S. has acclaimed General
  Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, using such adjectives as "innovative," "imaginative,"
  "adroit," "skillful," "flexible," and their favorite one, "pragmatic." This presumably
  is to distinguish him from the "dogmatic," "inflexible" and "conservative" leaders in
  the USSR. However, on July 21, 1988, the New York Times, in a front-page story, took a
  different tack. Gorbachev, said the Times in a bold headline, had joined the
  "hardliners" by his and the Soviet Presidium's insistence on barring the annexation to
  Armenia of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. What a quick turnaround!</p>

  <p>The imperialist press generally has shown considerable bias in its reporting of the
  Azerbaijan-Armenia dispute over the autonomous region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The
  Armenians have been quoted far more frequently and the Azerbaijanis very little, indeed
  â€“ for the most part in inconsequential phrases here and there. The U.S. government,
  immediately upon the outbreak of disorders in Azerbaijan and Armenia last winter, set
  up a task force in Europe to assist in processing the immigration of Armenians into the
  U.S. This is certainly in startling contrast to the willful and cruel way in which the
  U.S. has barred the door to Haitian immigrants fleeing political terror, as well as to
  Guatemalans and Salvadorans.</p>

  <p>The imperialist bourgeoisie may be entirely mistaken in its speculation regarding
  Armenia. Its interest in the conflict is worth bearing in mind, however, while awaiting
  developments. In the meantime, it is necessary to state that the decision of the Soviet
  leadership rejecting the appeal of the Armenians for the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh
  was the only possible way out, at least for the moment.</p>

  <p>The Soviet constitution states that no boundary lines may be changed without the
  voluntary agreement of the republics involved. To have agreed to a unilateral change of
  boundary lines in plain defiance of such an explicit constitutional provision would
  have brought on chaos among the many nationalities of the Soviet Union. It literally
  could open the door to the dismemberment of the USSR as a multinational socialist
  state. This may be putting it in extreme language, but once any of the republics is
  given the green light to unilaterally change its boundaries, this could break down the
  sovereignty and independence of all the others.</p>

  <p>Of course, boundaries could be changed by voluntary agreement after a period of
  socialist growth and class solidarity. Even the resettling of populations is possible
  in order to settle old boundary disputes or new ones that have developed in the many
  years since the Revolution. There were several instances of such agreements in the
  early years of the Soviet Union and after the Second World War.</p>

  <p>It cannot be repeated too often that the USSR is a truly great, multinational state
  with more than 100 nationalities scattered all over its vast territory. The fact that
  until now, through all the decades since the establishment of the Union of Soviet
  Socialist Republics in the early 1920s, there wasn't a major outbreak of violent
  nationalist struggle must attest to the highly progressive, indeed most revolutionary
  national structure of the Soviet government.</p>

  <p>One merely has to contrast this with the situation of Armenia, Azerbaijan and
  Georgia (the Caucasus region) before they became constituent republics of the USSR, at
  the time immediately after the First World War when the imperialists had a major
  influence and control there. Richard Pipes presented the imperialist point of view
  toward the so-called independent republics in his book <em>The Formation of the Soviet
  Union.</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">The drawing of boundaries was another source of difficulty for the governments and a
    constant cause of friction among the three republics.<br /><br />

    The population of Transcaucasia was intermingled to such an extent that it was
    impossible to divide the area along ethnic lines without doing violence to one or
    another of the groups inhabiting it. The Azerbaijani-Armenian frontier was especially
    troublesome, not only because the relations between those two peoples were at their
    worst following the mutual massacres of 1918 but also because the districts which
    they inhabited could be least successfully separated: Moslem and Armenian villages,
    located side by side, often used the same regions for cattle and sheep grazing.<br /><br />

    Since districts inhabited by a mixed Armenian and Azerbaijani population were
    generally claimed by both sides as their own, throughout 1919 and 1920 there were
    quarrels and occasional wars between the two states. They seriously weakened the
    internal stability of the republics and injured their prestige abroad. The main bone
    of contention were the Zangezur, Nakhichevan and Karabakh districts.<br /><br />

    The territorial aspirations of the Azerbaijani government were of considerable
    magnitude. In an official petition presented to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919,
    it claimed not only all of Eastern Transcaucasia but also Daghestan, Kars and Batum â€“
    an area comprising 60 percent of Transcaucasia and a portion of the North Caucasus as
    well. Since neither Georgia nor Armenia were willing to concede these claims, the
    relations between Azerbaijan and its neighbors remained constantly
    tense.<sup><a href="#1.">1</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Thus the imperialists virtually confessed their inability to solve the
  national question in the Caucasus in a peaceful way. It was so much easier for them to
  hand it all over to the counterrevolutionary White Guards.</p>

  <p>This doesn't mean that after the establishment of the USSR there was not a
  considerable residue of nationalism, but this must be examined in its historical
  context to see what can be learned from it that will shed light on the present
  situation. The bourgeois view, of course, is that the struggle between Armenia and
  Azerbaijan is either a purely nationalist one or a conflict of religions (Armenia
  Christian, Azerbaijan Moslem). It goes without saying that the bourgeoisie blame the
  social character of the Soviet Union as a socialist state, and in particular the
  earlier leaders of the USSR, as the basic cause of the conflict.</p>

  <p>General Secretary Gorbachev spoke on the national question to the Presidium of the
  Supreme Soviet on July 19, 1988. His talk was distributed in translation by Tass news
  service and reported on in the New York Times of July 21. How did he explain why there
  should be a struggle over the little enclave called Nagorno-Karabakh located in
  Azerbaijan and in which the majority of the population is Armenian? If an opinion of
  his views can be formed from this talk, it is altogether disappointing. His talk was
  mostly an attempt to blame so-called "irresponsible nationalist elements" in both
  Azerbaijan and Armenia. He talked of bribery and corruption, but these are only surface
  manifestations that don't go to the root of the problem.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">Protectionism [i.e., clique struggles or rivalries over turf â€“ S.M.], bribery, and
    the shadow economy are rampant in the republics. Perestroika has uncovered all that.
    ...<br /><br />

    Certain clans who would like to keep all the main spheres of life in their hands
    have developed there. ...<br /><br />

    Nagorno-Karabakh was used from both sides as a pretext to stir up nationalist
    sentiments, bringing them up to the nationalist form in order to conceal the really
    difficult, crying problems.<br /><br />

    But look, comrades, how passions are to some extent running out of control now:
    there appear slogans of anti-socialist, anti-Soviet and anti-Russian character.
    ...<br /><br />

    [If this continues,] it will strike out everything that has been created for many
    generations, poison the public mentality with nationalist venom and thereby spoil
    relations between the peoples for many, many years to come.<br /><br />

    Is this what they are after in Azerbaijan and Armenia? <sup><a href=
    "#2.">2</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As can be seen from this talk, the essence of his position is to put the
  blame squarely on irresponsible, nationalist and anti-socialist elements in both
  Azerbaijan and Armenia. In particular, he blames (without naming them) the so-called
  conservative elements, those who are opposed to perestroika, as being responsible when
  he says that elements in both republics use this issue as a pretext to stir up national
  sentiment.</p>

  <p>One thing is very clear from this talk: he absolves the Soviet leadership from any
  responsibility and avoids even a mention of the possibility of negative effects of the
  economic reforms (not the democratization process), nor does he pose the question as to
  whether the reforms could possibly have accentuated preexisting national animosities.
  He doesn't explain why over all these decades there has been no nationalist uprising â€“
  certainly none that we here in the West heard of, and it is certain that had there been
  one, the capitalist press would have ferreted it out and magnified it to the nth
  degree.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Gorbachev doesn't draw on the rich historical lessons of the Soviet
  Union. He doesn't go to the roots of national chauvinism. His is a bourgeois liberal
  approach to the national question, invoking morality instead of revolutionary communist
  internationalism.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, this rich history is available, and can be found in some detail in the
  proceedings of the Tenth and Twelfth Congresses of the Party,<sup><a href=
  "#3.">3</a></sup> not to speak of all the works by Lenin on the national question. The
  Tenth Congress laid the basis for the Party's position on the national question; the
  Twelfth Congress in particular carried forward all the prior discussions and
  resolutions. Gorbachev makes no reference to the many documents from this early period
  of the Soviet Union which gave such lucid expositions of the national question and
  described the situation of the republics and the federation in clear language, without
  any equivocation. His explanation is in sharp contrast to the approach the Party took
  to the national question right after the Revolution, when national antagonisms were
  exacerbated by the introduction of drastically needed economic reforms.</p>

  <p>As we have explained earlier, the New Economic Policy was inaugurated by Lenin in
  1921 as a temporary measure. It was a step backward toward market relations made
  necessary by the devastation of the imperialist war, counterrevolution and
  intervention. It was meant to get the economy of the country back on its feet after a
  period of terrible shortages, wide dislocation, economic sabotage by the bourgeoisie
  and also widespread famine. The whole idea was to supersede NEP as soon as possible
  with overall socialist planning of both industry and agriculture. The partial return to
  capitalism was done in order to win over the peasantry to support the industrialization
  efforts of the USSR, so that the country could get out of the disastrous economic
  situation into which the imperialists and the counterrevolutionaries had plunged
  it.</p>

  <p>Lenin more than anyone, while arguing that this return to some of the features of
  capitalism was an absolute necessity under the circumstances of post-war economic
  collapse, warned of its great dangers and pointed out where this could lead. And in
  fact, before it was abandoned in favor of the first five-year plan, it brought about
  the enrichment of the traders and merchants, the so-called nepmen or middlemen whom
  Lenin called the new bourgeoisie, as well as a much greater differentiation between
  poor and rich peasants. All the evils of capitalism began to resurface, including
  unemployment. But the great merit of the NEP period was that it had given the young
  Soviet state a breathing spell for reconstruction. Having achieved that, it was
  necessary to go forward. By what means this should be done then constituted the axis of
  a new political struggle in the Party.</p>

  <p>What relation does today's perestroika have to this earlier Soviet period? As has
  become well known by this time, there is today a strong and overriding tendency of the
  radical reformers in the USSR â€“ who are in reality bourgeois liberal reformers â€“ to
  clamor for the restoration of those aspects of Lenin's New Economic Policy which
  directly dealt with opening up the USSR to the capitalist market, establishing joint
  ventures with the imperialist bourgeoisie, privatizing light and medium industry and
  even loosening control over the nationalized sector.</p>

  <p>The most prominent ideological leader of this trend today, as we have written
  earlier,<sup><a href="#4.">4</a></sup> is the economist Nikolai Shmelyov. He has been
  one of the most blatant and uninhibited in proclaiming the need to return to the New
  Economic Policy of the early 1920s. Gorbachev himself has stated that he agrees with
  Shmelyov's analysis "of the state of affairs in the economy ... as it actually exists
  today," but disagrees with other aspects of it, such as Shmelyov's flagrant insistence
  that "some unemployment is necessary" in the USSR, which Gorbachev says would be
  against socialism.<sup><a href="#5.">5</a></sup></p>

  <p>It's not altogether wrong to define the so-called radical economic reformers, such
  as A.G. Aganbegyan, Leonid Abalkin, Tatyana Zaslavskaya and others, as the Shmelyov
  tendency. Their views are generally shared by many of Gorbachev's leading
  supporters.</p>

  <p>Let us see then how the national question, as it pertained to Azerbaijan, Armenia
  and Georgia, was analyzed in a resolution adopted by the Twelfth Congress of the
  Russian Communist Party in April 1923, and entitled "National Factors in Party and
  State Development." <sup><a href="#6.">6</a></sup> The resolution is very important
  because at that time Lenin was still alive and it was adopted unanimously, with the
  agreement of the entire leadership of the USSR. Even though there had been lengthy and
  intense debate on a number of other issues, the position on the national question, as
  formulated and adopted in this resolution, won the support of all the groupings.</p>

  <p>The resolution deals, of course, with local chauvinism, but it shows that the
  origins of such chauvinism lie in national oppression, that is, the oppression by the
  Great Russians. Bear in mind that this resolution was passed at a congress of the
  <strong>Russian</strong> Communist Party â€“ and that it was criticizing first and
  foremost the great-power chauvinism of the Russian nationality.</p>

  <p>The Congress also thought it very important to point out that the New Economic
  Policy had exaggerated and made very acute what remained of local antagonisms. The
  resolution shows how inequality fostered by economic oppression, from both the Great
  Russians and the imperialists, inflamed local antagonisms.</p>

  <p>First, the resolution says that the heritage of czarism consisted:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">... in the first place, in the survivals of Great-Power chauvinism, which is a
    reflection of the former privileged position of the Great-Russians. These survivals
    still persist in the minds of our Soviet officials, both central and local; they
    breed in our institutions, central and local; they are receiving reinforcements in
    the shape of the `new' Smenovekh Great-Russian chauvinist spirit, <strong>which the
    New Economic Policy tends to accentuate.</strong><sup><a href="#7.">7</a></sup> (Our
    emphasis.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It should be remembered that this was written in 1923 when Lenin was still
  alive and had great influence in shaping the positions taken by the Party. Lenin was
  the architect of the New Economic Policy, and also the inspirer and architect of the
  nationality position of the USSR as embodied in the various resolutions of the Party.</p>

  <p>It's important that at a time when the New Economic Policy was scarcely two years
  old, note was immediately taken by the leading Party of the USSR, the Russian Party,
  that the New Economic Policy was reinforcing chauvinism, above all the chauvinism of
  the Great-Russians. In other words, the turn towards small-scale commodity production
  and so on, the turn toward private initiative, reinforced the worst features of the old
  czarist regime &ndash;  national oppression.</p>

  <p>The resolution goes on:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">The situation in a number of the national republics (the Ukraine, White Russia,
    Azerbaijan and Turkestan) is complicated by the fact that a considerable section of
    the working class, which forms the main support of Soviet government, are by
    nationality Great-Russian. In these districts the alliance between the town and the
    countryside, between the working class and the peasantry, encounters a powerful
    obstacle in the form of the survivals of Great-Russian chauvinism. ... Thus, the
    first immediate task of our Party is to wage determined warfare on the survivals of
    Great-Russian chauvinism. ...<br /><br />

    <p>The equality of legal status of the nations won by the October Revolution is a
    great achievement for the peoples, but it does not in itself solve the whole national
    problem. ... The causes of this actual inequality [of the nationalities  &ndash;  S.M.] lie
    not only in the history of these peoples, but also in the policy pursued by czarism
    and the Russian bourgeoisie, which aimed at converting the border regions into areas
    exclusively producing raw materials and exploited by the industrially developed
    central districts. To remove this inequality in a short space of time, to eliminate
    this heritage in a year or two, is impossible. The Tenth Congress of our Party has
    already pointed out that "the elimination of actual national inequality is a lengthy
    process involving a stubborn and persistent struggle against all survivals of
    national oppression and colonial slavery." But eliminated it must be at all costs.
    And it can be eliminated only if real and prolonged assistance is given by the
    Russian proletariat to the backward peoples of the Union in their economic and
    cultural advancement. ... [T]his assistance must, in accordance with the resolution
    of the Tenth Congress, be rendered simultaneously with the struggle of the toiling
    masses against the local and foreign exploiting <strong>upper strata, which are
    gaining in strength in connection with the New Economic Policy,</strong> and for the
    consolidation of their social positions. [Our emphasis  &ndash;  S.M.]<br /><br />

  ... This heritage consists, lastly, in the survivals of nationalism among
  a number of peoples which have suffered the heavy yoke of national oppression and have
  not yet managed to rid themselves of old national grudges. ... [I]n some of the
  republics the population of which is made up of several nationalities, this defensive
  nationalism often turns into aggressive nationalism, into the outright chauvinism of
  the stronger nationality directed against the weaker nationalities of these republics.
  Georgian chauvinism (in Georgia) against the Armenians, Ossets, Adjarians and
  Abkhasians; Azerbaijanian chauvinism (in Azerbaijan) against the Armenians; Uzbek
  chauvinism (in Bokhara and Khorezm) against the Turkmens and Kirghiz, Armenian
  chauvinism, and so on  &ndash;  <strong>all these forms of chauvinism, which moreover are
  fostered by the conditions of the New Economic Policy and by competition, are a great
  evil which threatens to make certain of the national republics the scene of squabbling
  and wrangling.</strong><sup><a href="#8.">8</a></sup> [Our emphasis  &ndash;  S.M.]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In Lenin's day, it was ABC for the Party to recognize that the revival of bourgeois
  economic competition almost immediately aggravated national antagonisms,
  notwithstanding the urgency of making a broad retreat in order to take the long step
  forward to build socialism. Should it not be clear that three-and-a-half years of the
  economic reforms have aggravated the national animosities in the USSR today as
  exemplified in Armenia and Azerbaijan?</p>

  <p>Was it not the bourgeois aspects of perestroika that stimulated and accentuated
  local nationalism? Was it not an act of Great Russian chauvinism to have replaced
  Dinmukhamed A. Kunayev, the first secretary of the Communist Party in Kazakhstan and
  himself a Kazahk, with a Great Russian, Gennadi V. Kolbin, in 1986?</p>

  <p>There was justification for perestroika when the proletariat was a minority of the
  population, when it was exhausted by a revolutionary struggle to save the Soviet Union.
  Is there any justification today for the introduction of economic reforms that are so
  perilously analogous to the negative aspects of the New Economic Policy? With virtually
  one voice, the whole international bourgeoisie keeps cheering for each new step in the
  direction of the NEP-like bourgeois reforms. They are never satisfied and keep on
  goading the USSR leadership to go further and further. Should not the lessons of
  Azerbaijan and Armenia make the Soviet leaders pause and reconsider?</p>
