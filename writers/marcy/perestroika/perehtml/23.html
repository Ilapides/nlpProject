  <h2>Aftermath of the miners' strike</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>A fork in the road for perestroika? Strikes spread to railroads. A vote of no
    confidence in government. Economic situation worsens under Gorbachev. Reforms dilute
    public ownership, change social relations, bring demoralization and corruption.
    Gorbachev report to Congress: austerity, criticism of workers, attack on "leveling."
    Ratio of managers to workers rising. Context of agreement between government and
    miners. Workers' wages to be linked to market. Can industry be integrated and
    modernized under "self-financing"? Capitalist world market and the British coal
    miners. Bourgeois elements exploit grievances of workers. Leaders must review their
    strategic conception or face a struggle of the working class against the
    government.</strong>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>The summer of 1989 is likely to go down in Soviet history as the time when
  the Gorbachev administration reached a fork in the road in the development of
  perestroika and in particular in its relations with the broad working class of the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>The miners' strike has put an altogether new face on all the political and social
  problems. The ferment it has created has stimulated the interest of the whole working
  class. Suffice it to say that barely a few days after the government and the miners
  reached their historic agreement, the railway workers gave notice that they too would
  be on strike unless their demands were met.</p>

  <p>Thus, on August 2, 1989, the railroad workers went on a brief strike on the
  Leningrad-Vyborg line. While it lasted for only a few hours, it was sufficient to cause
  Nikolai Konarev, the rail minister, to at once enter into negotiations with the
  workers' representatives in Moscow. Their demands, so far as one can learn at this
  stage, were very similar to what the miners were able to obtain.<sup><a href=
  "#1.">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>The miners' strike stunned virtually the entire officialdom of the Soviet Union.
  None of them had even hinted that such a development was in the offing. Perhaps the
  best way to understand why the workers suddenly and spontaneously took this massive
  action, on a nationwide scale that included the Donets Basin, the Kuznetz Basin in
  Western Siberia, the pits in Vorkuta, Rostov and others, is to examine the immediate
  political background. In the preceding months  &ndash;  May, June and July  &ndash;  glasnost was at
  its height, one might even say at its best. The new parliamentary institutions of the
  USSR, the Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet, were in session. The
  government took every opportunity to spread its perestroika message via the media
  through the length and breadth of the land. These meetings were televised in full, so
  there could be no mistaking that the government was making every effort to bring its
  message to the broadest possible audience. It was even reported that production fell
  markedly during this period, so keen was the interest of the people in the
  deliberations of these bodies. Gorbachev's opening speech was heard over and over
  again. Certainly the masses had every opportunity to hear the message of perestroika
  and the debates surrounding it.</p>

  <p>Why (Gorbachev must ask himself) did the miners then resort to this wholly
  unanticipated action, one he himself compared to an explosion, a virtual Chernobyl? And
  if the coal strike was just an accidental occurrence, why then did the railroad workers
  threaten to carry it even further? It would be impossible to argue that the message of
  perestroika, as interpreted by the deputies, officials and Gorbachev himself, had not
  been heard. Rather, the strike was a virtual vote of no confidence in the plans of the
  government.</p>

  <p>There is a difference between the television reports of the 19th Party Conference
  held in the summer of 1988 and the Congress held at the end of May 1989. The 19th Party
  Conference was televised with a view to getting the approval of the world press,
  particularly the world capitalist press. This Congress, however, was calculated to
  reach the mass of the people at home, and received minimal attention in the capitalist
  press.</p>

  <p>What, then, went wrong?</p>

  <p>Were Gorbachev to attempt a dispassionate analysis of the basic causes for the
  workers' mass action and the ensuing ferment, he would be wise to go over his own
  speech to the Congress on May 30, 1989. He would there discover that he and the mass of
  the workers, in particular the miners, were at cross purposes. If he were a leader in
  the Leninist tradition of criticism and self-criticism, he would do what Lenin did in
  the early 1920s when he reviewed the need to abandon War Communism and institute a New
  Economic Policy. Gorbachev finds himself in a similar position. His program as
  elaborated in perestroika is leading to an aggravation of the economic situation. In
  this case, it is impelling him in the direction of eroding and nullifying socialist
  ownership of the means of production and plunging into the capitalist market.</p>

  <p>Seeing that this is leading to a disastrous situation, Gorbachev should proclaim the
  need for not just a tactical twist and turn here and there but for a strategic retreat,
  an abandonment of the bourgeois character of the reforms and a return to Leninist
  concepts to further socialist construction and advance toward communism. The other way
  leads to the abyss and threatens to put the Soviet economy and those of all the other
  socialist countries at the mercy of the capitalist market and the imperialist
  monopolies.</p>

  <p>The coal mining industry exemplifies how perestroika is proceeding. The overall aim
  has always been to achieve an integrated mining industry, fully mechanized and
  automated with the last word in modern technology. This is what one would have expected
  in 1985 when Gorbachev and the other leaders presented their program to a plenary
  session of the Supreme Soviet. Then the masses were led to believe that perestroika
  meant technological restructuring, raising the productivity of labor and developing the
  necessary managerial skills. But now the Gorbachev group is pushing instead for a
  breakup of the mining industry into individual enterprises and dilution of the public
  ownership of one of the basic means of production in the hands of the workers' state.
  He is changing fundamental social relations by watering down the public sector while
  enhancing the private sector by various devices. This has led to demoralization of the
  masses and the corruption of those involved.</p>

  <p>During the Congress sessions, the miners, like all the rest of the working class,
  were listening to see what in the speeches of the deputies and in particular of
  Gorbachev himself would speak to their anticipation of increased social benefits and
  relief from the hardships of consumer shortages, lack of adequate housing, unsafe
  working conditions and so on. However, Gorbachev's message in particular called for
  austerity measures of the kind constantly being brought up in capitalist countries, the
  kind which the Soviet press and media, especially in earlier days, widely publicized as
  symptoms of capitalist decay.<sup><a href="#2.">2</a></sup></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">Begin with the fact that the state is continuing to live beyond its means. Budget
    expenditures during this five-year plan are growing faster than the national economy.
    Hence, the budget deficit is increasing. ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>What does that portend for the masses? An increase in social services, or
  possible cuts?</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">A situation is being created in which expenditures for wages are growing much faster
    than labor productivity. ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Isn't this what workers in the capitalist countries have had drummed into
  their heads day after day? Soviet workers have heard about all this. Again, what does
  this portend for them now?</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">An analysis of the causes of the current situation would be incomplete if we did not
    point out that the losses from mismanagement and low labor discipline continue to be
    great. ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>It is small comfort to the workers that the managerial elite are being
  castigated along with "low labor discipline." The former are not likely to suffer at
  the hands of the Gorbachev administration, which has become enamored with the idea of
  giving the managers greater and greater freedom and independence. The complaint about
  low labor discipline, however, carries the threat of displacement. In connection with
  this, the workers have seen what happens with managerial independence and autonomy.
  Gorbachev admits that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">... the granting of economic independence is being accompanied by growth in the
    number of personnel. For every six workers, there is a manager or a specialist.
    Hence, someone is benefiting from this.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>This is no revelation to the workers, for whom it means speedup and an
  intensification of the labor process. How can any worker become enthusiastic about
  that? But that is not all. Gorbachev has also come back to one of the frequent refrains
  that used to be heard over and over, and which has taken on an especially offensive
  character in the more recent period.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">In solving problems of the country's social and economic development, we must proceed
    from the consistent implementation of the principle of social justice. It is not
    enough to proclaim it: It is also necessary to put into action social and economic
    mechanisms that will make it possible to eliminate the main hindrance to our
    development  &ndash;  leveling and the deeply rooted psychology of dependence.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Who are the levelers? Are they the top leaders in the governmental
  apparatus? Are they the scientific and literary intelligentsia? Are they the managers?
  Isn't it true that this charge is aimed solely and exclusively at the workers, who are
  not trying to level the higher-paid workers down to a lower level but are attempting to
  raise themselves to a higher standard of living? Isn't leveling an outcry against
  social and economic privilege? Do Gorbachev and his supporters really expect the
  workers to become enthused with perestroika in the face of all this?</p>

  <p>It is hard to see how workers can draw inspiration from this rather than from the
  example set by the miners. The concessions the miners won in terms of immediate demands
  are substantial (they include extra pay for night and evening shifts, Sundays off,
  portal-to-portal pay, improved pensions and sick leave benefits) and it is impossible
  to avoid the conclusion that workers in other industries will be influenced by what has
  been achieved. It is a momentous beginning to a resurgence of the working class. But
  the immediate economic gains won by the miners were sandwiched together with a broader
  economic program which is part of the perestroika restructuring plans.</p>

  <p>The contract with the coal miners can be divided into two parts: those clauses which
  pertain to immediate economic demands and those which are of a broader economic
  character, namely, the economic independence of the enterprises, a method of
  profit-sharing, and the right of individual enterprises to dispose of excess coal
  production through sale at home and abroad.</p>

  <p>The basic thrust of the economic independence clause amounts to this: that whatever
  profit can be obtained by selling coal left over after government quotas have been
  fulfilled will redound to the benefit of the coal mining enterprise. As the text of the
  agreement says, "industrial enterprises are to be granted the right, as of 1 August
  1989, to sell above-contract output at contract prices within the country and to other
  countries." <sup><a href="#3.">3</a></sup> This may appear attractive. However, as
  Gorbachev himself explained in his May 30 speech to the Congress, one of the basic
  reasons for the crisis in the Soviet economy is "the extensive losses linked to the
  drop in world prices for fuel and raw materials." Coal is one of those fuels. The
  Soviet Union is a significant exporter of gas, oil and coal.</p>

  <p>Thus, the very idea of linking the wages and benefits of the workers in a coal
  mining enterprise to the capitalist world market, which at the present time is glutted,
  portends not higher benefits but lower ones. Moreover, competition among the various
  coal mining enterprises can result in overproduction, if the product is destined for
  the world capitalist market. It has been difficult enough for Soviet coal to compete on
  the world market as an integrated industry, but then at least the Soviet government
  could offer one uniform price. However, if each mining district is to offer its own
  price, they are in effect bidding against each other in the capitalist market.</p>

  <p>What good can possibly be derived from competition in the domestic market if, in the
  world market, competition forces them to accept lower prices? With the coal destined
  for socialist countries, if competition is to be the driving force, then it pits the
  Soviet miners against the miners of Poland or Yugoslavia. What does socialist
  solidarity or Comecon planning mean then?</p>

  <p>It's difficult to know in the final analysis what is meant by cost accounting and
  self-financing, two of the cardinal features of perestroika. Self-financing widens the
  latitude of each enterprise's managerial group in the use of its financial resources,
  but at the same time limits the ability of the enterprise to draw on the resources of
  the central government. By breaking up an integrated industry like coal into various
  independent enterprises, it is assumed that the savings of the enterprise would result
  in social benefits for the workers in it. Instead, however, as we already quoted from
  Gorbachev, "the granting of economic independence is being accompanied by the growth in
  the number of personnel. For every six workers, there is a manager or a specialist."
  Doesn't such an enormous development nullify the whole scheme for managerial
  independence? Nothing could be more damning than such an admission. The whole program
  is promoted as one where the heavy weight of bureaucracy is to be reduced. But it turns
  out that, at least on a managerial scale, it has vastly increased.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the funds saved by operating as an independent unit were supposed to then
  be available for social services or wage increases. Instead, however, large sums are
  accumulating in the treasuries of these enterprises. Since the managers are free to use
  them more or less as they see fit, they are being invested in areas which produce a
  quick profit but do not necessarily have any value for the socialist economy or the
  workers. Indeed, such independence in the financial field is the cause of overblown
  personal gain and even a vast increase in corruption on a managerial level.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev told the Congress:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">In connection with the radical economic reform, financial and material resources are
    being accumulated at enterprises and in local administrative agencies. It seems to me
    that labor collectives could pool their efforts to expand the base of medical service
    for the population. ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>First, he wants to break up an integrated industry for the purposes of
  distribution and sale, and then he brings in through the back door a form of
  collectivism, the pooling of efforts, which is the very opposite of what he is trying
  to stimulate. It's no wonder, then, that improved health care is one of the pressing
  demands of workers in all communities, as reflected in the Soviet press.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev has again restated his reforms, this time as:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">... a radical updating of relations of socialist ownership and the development and
    combination of its various forms. We favor the creation of flexible and effective
    relations with respect to the use of public property, so that every form of ownership
    demonstrates its vitality and right to exist in lively and fair competition.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>These are disguised efforts to undermine socialist ownership in favor of
  some form of private ownership. After four years of perestroika, of private
  cooperatives, of leasing the land, of legislation favoring individual entrepreneurs, he
  now wants to embark on a program of further destabilizing elements of public ownership.
  There is public ownership and private ownership. Creating some mythical hybrid form is
  mere deception. Socialist ownership has proven itself superior to capitalism. How else
  could the Soviet Union have become second in the race between the so-called
  superpowers? What does this "fair competition" among forms of ownership signify to the
  miners, for instance? The mines are public property owned by the state in accordance
  with the Constitution of the USSR. Does he now want to release them to private
  ownership under the guise of some form of cooperative enterprise? Calling it a flexible
  and effective use of public property is a coverup. It is plain that the Gorbachev
  reforms are heading away from socialization, away from advancing toward communism, and
  back toward the older forms of bourgeois and petit-bourgeois private ownership.</p>

  <p>This is particularly devastating for the coal industry when it must compete on the
  world market. The capitalist markets of France, Britain and West Germany are integrated
  industries that have been rationalized and modernized at the expense of brutal
  onslaughts against the working class, particularly in Britain, so that they have been
  able to reduce the price of coal. What the Gorbachev administration wants to do is
  avoid taking the blame for the losses sustained in competition with the capitalist
  countries. Instead of letting the all-union socialist government foot the bill, if that
  becomes necessary, he'd rather make it appear that the losses are incurred as a result
  of poor management of the individual enterprises. All this might make some sense if the
  capitalist coal industry were broken up into small units, but this is not likely
  because the mines in the capitalist countries are if anything more integrated and
  rationalized and are managed by a combination of bankers and industrialists. It's not
  at all a case of the old free market, as it presumably existed in the 19th century.
  This is finance capital, where competition is not only of a predatory character but is
  more destructive in relation to any rivals, especially those from a socialist
  country.</p>

  <p>It is no wonder, then, that Valentin Medvedev, secretary of the Central Committee of
  the Coal Miners' Union, said recently, "Many problems have been aggravated since the
  introduction of cost accounting and self-financing on January 1 of this year."
  <sup><a href="#4.">4</a></sup></p>

  <p>Gorbachev told the Congress that "Considerable resources can be freed up by sharply
  reducing the volume of capital investments in the construction of production
  facilities." Capital investment means the construction of plants and equipment  &ndash;  in
  Marxist terminology, the means of production. The Gorbachev regime is headed in the
  other direction at a time when the imperialist bourgeoisie is speeding up capital
  investment, enlisting the support of the entire capitalist establishment. In the U.S.
  the government wants to support capital investment by generous tax credits. For
  instance, the New York Times of August 7, 1989, stated editorially that the most
  effective way to get corporations to invest more is to reimburse them for a part of the
  cost of investment. The only point of contention in the bourgeoisie is how to apply the
  tax credits; some say they should be advanced only to those who are introducing more
  modern equipment. It indicates how deeply concerned both segments of the capitalist
  establishment, liberals and conservatives, are about uniting to spur capitalist
  investment in order to compete on the world arena.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev told the Congress he favors "the inclusion of the Soviet economy in the
  world economy," in other words, the integration of the USSR into the world capitalist
  market. Regardless of the merit of this scheme, how can that be done when his aim is to
  cut down on capital investment? It is of course possible that in the USSR some
  industrial and technological facilities have not proven economical, or have become
  so-called white elephants. But that only means that the planning has to be perfected,
  not abandoned. That this should have to be discussed in the year 1989, after so many
  decades of rich experience in the Soviet Union, speaks ill of the Gorbachev
  administration.</p>

  <p>There has to be a balance, of course, between planning for consumption and
  production. During the difficult years of World War II and especially the Cold War,
  when the Soviet Union was virtually blockaded economically as well as politically, the
  rate of building consumer industries declined, both absolutely and in relative numbers.
  In order to catch up, it was necessary to pay the greatest attention to them. However,
  instead of proceeding with a more comprehensive plan to develop consumer industries,
  Gorbachev has now embarked on a plan to change the relations of production, to reduce
  socialist planning, to bring about capitalist competition. And what has all this
  amounted to? Disorder and chaos in the economy.</p>

  <p>This holds great danger for the Soviet Union. As the miners' strike shows, the
  outright bourgeois elements, who have now officially organized themselves as a grouping
  in the Congress, are able and willing to exploit the grievances of the workers and try
  and turn them in an anti-socialist direction. All the newspapers in the Soviet Union
  carried news of how a great number of agitators descended upon the coal miners with
  advice on building independent unions. Independent of whom? Not of the bourgeoisie, not
  of the imperialists, not of the capitalist market.</p>

  <p>Already the workers are endangered ideologically when they see the Gorbachev
  administration sanctifying the coalition in Poland between the imperialist-supported,
  CIA-constructed Solidarity leadership and the Polish United Workers Party based on a
  program which can only antagonize the majority of the workers. What are the Soviet
  workers to think when they see what is happening in Poland?</p>

  <p>Any way one views it, the time has come for even the staunchest supporters of
  perestroika to admit that they have to review their strategic conception. The strikes
  of coal miners and other workers make it very clear that the issue for the leadership
  now is whether to serve the interests of the working class or to dissipate and erode
  the achievements of the socialist revolution in the interests of petit-bourgeois
  schemes to change the property relations in the Soviet Union. This could only provoke
  civil conflict and ultimately a struggle of the working class against the government as
  such.</p>
