  <h2>The socialist solution to the food problem: Part 1</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>Comparison of Khrushchev and Gorbachev. Gorbachev consolidates agriculture
    ministries. Reorganization of personnel as a factional maneuver. "Revolution" from
    above. New economic mechanisms: the private cooperative. "There are rogues in the
    cooperatives." Breaking collectives into smaller units inconsistent with socialist
    development, hasn't solved food problem. Lenin on cooperation. Attempt in 1920s to
    win middle peasants to cooperatives failed. Left, right and center in the
    Party.</strong>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>When Mikhail Gorbachev took over the post of General Secretary of the
  Communist Party in March 1985, he alone among the top leaders in the Politburo had
  accumulated significant experience in the food program of the USSR. As a result of his
  tenure in office as Party Secretary of Agriculture, he seemed to be the one person who
  could resolve the country's most crying problem: the food question and related problems
  arising from the chronic agricultural crisis.</p>

  <p>Of all the leaders since the death of Stalin  &ndash;  Gorbachev, Chernenko, Andropov,
  Brezhnev, Khrushchev and Malenkov  &ndash;  only two, Khrushchev and Gorbachev, could claim
  extended experience in agriculture as a significant factor in their rise to head the
  Party and the government. Of course, Brezhnev also had experience, but it was not as
  critical a factor in his rise.</p>

  <p>There can be no more important problem in any country than the food supply. In both
  ancient and modern times, governments have been swept away after natural catastrophes
  when they were unable to alleviate the situation. Marshall Goldman, a none too friendly
  critic of the Soviet Union, says in his <em>Gorbachev's Challenge,</em> "Agriculture
  has its own special problems. Beginning in 1979, the Soviet Union suffered seven bad
  grain harvests in a row." <sup><a href="#1.">1</a></sup> He conveniently forgets
  President Carter's export embargo on selling grain to the Soviet Union, which
  unquestionably aggravated the food situation.</p>

  <p>It is a staggering problem. Nevertheless, Gorbachev has not overestimated the
  significance of the objective factor in the agricultural problems of the USSR. Rather,
  what he has done over a period of time is establish himself as a critic of the
  management and techniques used in the agrarian sector.</p>

  <p>Khrushchev had been a peasant, unlike Gorbachev, whose agricultural experience was
  mostly involved in administration as a career political leader. Even as early as
  Stalin's tenure, Khrushchev had accumulated some remarkable successes, first as
  secretary in charge of agriculture of the Ukrainian Party, and, second, as the person
  responsible for having pushed forward collectivization under Stalin. A highly
  progressive scheme to amalgamate the thousands of small collectives into larger units
  was his, and proved to be singularly successful. Gorbachev's experience, however, has
  been more in administration than in the direct management of agriculture. After a
  considerable period in office, there is no evidence to date that Gorbachev's
  achievements have been any more than lackluster.</p>

  <p>Khrushchev had an altogether different personality; his demeanor may have
  occasionally been regarded as rude and crude, which was unfairly attributed to his
  peasant origins. All of the post-Khrushchev writers and considerable biographical
  material in both the East and West agree on this. His shoe-banging demonstration at the
  UN is regarded as evidence of his crudeness. Of course, never mentioned is the
  historical context: the tense and charged atmosphere of late 1960, when a U-2 spy plane
  had recently been shot down over the USSR and anti-Soviet, anti-Cuban propaganda
  reached its peak as Khrushchev and Fidel Castro, in New York to address the UN General
  Assembly, met at the Theresa Hotel in Harlem.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev's style, on the other hand, to the extent that one can have observed him
  from the outside in his years as general secretary, is that of a Western CEO (the chief
  executive officer of a large multinational corporation) rather than of a communist
  leader of the older generation, especially the Bolsheviks. Hardly anything comes
  through in his speeches which would indicate a link to the older generation of
  communist leaders. When Mikhail Kalinin, for instance, became president of the Soviet
  state in 1925, he was almost universally viewed as a peasant, which he was. Gorbachev,
  on the other hand, is a lawyer, a university graduate who studied law and public
  administration. It is from all these points of view that he is a leader, as so many
  bourgeois commentators have said, of a new type, and his collaborators in the Party
  leadership have in one way or another fallen into substantially the same social
  category. But food and agriculture is the problem of problems before them. In the long
  run, if there is a severe crisis, they will be held accountable.</p>

  <p>In Gorbachev's very first speech following the death of Chernenko, he said, "We
  should, we are bound to attain the most advanced scientific and technical positions,
  <strong>the highest world level in the productivity of social labor</strong>. In order
  to resolve the task with greater success and speed, it is necessary to continue to
  perfect persistently the <strong>economic mechanism</strong> and the entire management
  system. ... This means invariably carrying out a planned development of the economy,
  strengthening socialist ownership, expanding the rights, <strong>enhancing the
  independence of enterprises, raising their interest in the end product of their
  work</strong>." (Our emphases  &ndash;  S.M.)</p>

  <p>There soon followed exhortations and directives regarding the expansion of
  democratic rights "to the fullest extent possible" and the opening up of a campaign
  against "bureaucracy" on a scale that dwarfed anything either Khrushchev or others had
  embarked upon.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the public eye was first and foremost on the food and agricultural
  sector; that's where Gorbachev's expertise was involved and much was expected from that
  area. Thus, on November 22, 1985, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet announced the
  first of a number of sweeping overhauls of the government. Some 50 government
  ministries were earmarked for significant changes or outright abolition. But most
  important was the abolition of five key ministries that dealt with food and
  agriculture: 1) the Ministry of Agriculture, 2) the Ministry of the Fruit and Vegetable
  Industry, 3) the Ministry of Rural Construction, 4) the Ministry of the Meat and Dairy
  Industry, and 5) the Ministry of the Food Industry. Also dissolved was the State
  Committee for Production and Servicing of Agriculture.<sup><a href=
  "#2.">2</a></sup></p>

  <p>If the problem was bureaucratic practices, this should have done it. If bureaucratic
  inertia and lack of contact between the masses and the officialdom had been the major
  brake upon agriculture (as has so frequently been charged), and if what was needed to
  revive agricultural production and substantially increase the food supply was the
  renewal of personnel in all these ministries and departments, then this move should
  have been the answer, at least in part.</p>

  <p>However, the reorganization of the agricultural and food administrations was not
  altogether a new idea. Reorganizations have been going on for years, practically since
  the establishment of the Soviet Union. There was considerable overhauling during and
  after collectivization and during the wartime years. Most dramatic was what appeared to
  be a liberalization and a dramatic blow at the agricultural bureaucracy during the
  Khrushchev era, meant to bring the administrators and organizers of agriculture closer
  to the masses. One of Khrushchev's reforms had been to move the Ministry of Agriculture
  from Moscow back to the rural areas so as to put it in direct contact with agricultural
  production. It was a bold move and a brave one at that, for he could not possibly have
  earned the gratitude of those forced to move from the capital to the provinces, with
  the hardships that would cause them and their families. But it wasn't just the
  ministries in Moscow that moved to rural areas, it was also the ministries of the
  various republics. From the point of view of an orthodox communist position, keeping in
  touch with the masses had always meant being where the masses themselves were. And that
  meant a minimum of representation in Moscow or in the capitals of the republics.</p>

  <p>If anything should have enhanced the democratization process during the Khrushchev
  period, this was it. Closer contact with the masses was regarded as of cardinal
  significance in the struggle of the Party to be in the vanguard of the workers and the
  peasantry. For a Party member to be a peasant or be close to the farms was a badge of
  honor, since this usually entailed a great deal of hard work, tireless energy and
  removal from the center of political struggle. But this particular reorganization by
  Khrushchev did not accomplish what it was intended to, because it was also a
  factionally motivated maneuver to get rid of, as far as possible, the old holdovers,
  those who had been loyal supporters of the Stalin regime or were suspected of being
  opposed to the Khrushchev reforms. Sending out administrators from the center to the
  provinces was a tactic used during the Stalin regime and by governments the world over.
  But it did little to solve the overall problem confronting agriculture, notwithstanding
  the remarkable successes of Khrushchev with the virgin lands experiment and his earlier
  amalgamation of the small, scattered collectives into larger ones.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev's move in November 1985 produced similar results. If what was needed was
  to overhaul the bureaucratic apparatus, to bring in fresh cadres from the ranks and
  from enthusiastic supporters of democratization, then Gorbachev's overhaul should have
  resulted in a spectacular success in the food and agricultural program. However, the
  wholesale abolition of these departments was in reality merely a consolidation. They
  were put under the jurisdiction of a new super-agency, the State Committee for the
  Agro-Industrial Complex.<sup><a href="#3.">3</a></sup> What is more, Gorbachev
  succeeded in getting Vsevolod S. Murakhovsky, Communist Party leader in the region of
  Stavropol, Gorbachev's home base, to head the new agency. Gorbachev had taken a leaf
  from Khrushchev in his reorganization; on balance it seemed to have been a way to get
  rid of the old office holders from the Brezhnev era and put in his own supporters.</p>

  <p>Overhauling the agricultural apparatus looked on the surface like a democratic
  measure. In reality, it was merely a change of personnel. Nowhere was there any
  indication of the anticipated groundswell of support for the Gorbachev measures from
  the millions of workers and peasants on the collective farms or in the food-processing
  industry.</p>

  <p>The changes at the top were not a reflection of social ferment in the collective
  farm population, among the workers from the service centers which supply them with
  technical assistance, or in other areas of the population involved in agriculture.
  Indeed, the mass of the workers and peasants all over the USSR were not at all moved by
  the new reorganization, although there was the usual praise and approval at selected
  meetings of agricultural functionaries. This measure, more than others, confirmed that
  the "Gorbachev revolution," as it is frequently called in the bourgeois press, is
  strictly a revolution from the top. And it is truer in the area of agriculture than
  anywhere else.</p>

  <p>There's no evidence that the "democratization" had reached or involved the lowest
  echelons of the mass of the workers and peasants, especially in the poorer collectives.
  Revolutionary change at the top, if it is really revolutionary, ultimately evokes a
  response from the masses below. But that was not at all the case. It turned out to be
  merely a change of personnel  &ndash;  although there's no doubt that the new government
  administration had the authority and perhaps the obligation to change the personnel if
  indeed the old holdovers were obstructing the new program of "radical
  restructuring."</p>

  <p>The many exhortations to democratize the organs, to instill a new stimulus to the
  masses, to bring out their creative initiative and so forth had little to do with
  enhancing and increasing agricultural and food production. It just didn't happen.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev's speech in June 1988 to the 19th Party Conference is most eloquent
  testimony to the failure of his own policy. "Let me begin with the food problem," said
  Gorbachev, "which is probably the most painful and the most acute problem in the life
  of our society." <sup><a href="#4.">4</a></sup> Thus, more than three years after he
  took over and two-and-a-half years after his reorganization of the administration of
  agriculture, the food problem had become the "most painful and most acute problem."</p>

  <p>But the Gorbachev administration has not relied on political and administrative
  measures alone to solve the food and agricultural problem. It has a two-fold approach.
  It is singularly concerned with new economic mechanisms to replace the old ones.
  Indeed, the political measures are complementary to the new economic mechanisms. By the
  time of the 19th Party Conference, the greatest attention was being paid to a series of
  innovations and experiments in the farm and food sector which were supposed to revive
  agriculture and accelerate the production of food. All this was to be done in the
  "shortest time possible." But what are the new economic mechanisms?</p>

  <p>They include first of all the development of private cooperatives. Private
  cooperatives have existed sporadically in Soviet farming and the service industry for a
  long time. Now and then they have been restricted or abolished, only to be revived
  again, although in a limited way. This latest attempt by Gorbachev is the most sweeping
  to date. According to his accounts, it is taking hold.</p>

  <p>A private cooperative, it should be remembered, is altogether different from a
  collective. A private cooperative is a grouping of people who join together to
  cultivate farm land or set up some small business <strong>on the basis of
  profit</strong>. In the case of an agricultural cooperative, the land is leased to the
  cooperative, while the tools may be privately owned. Its objective is to give free vent
  to the entrepreneurial initiative in the hope that this will facilitate production,
  especially in agriculture, consumer goods and services. There are, of course,
  restrictions by the state, but they are not really significant. Moreover, the
  cooperatives, under a new law now in effect, may have the right to hire labor, provided
  the wages paid are the same as in the public sector. This is a real break with the
  past, which prohibited the hiring of labor as exploitation of the workers, regardless
  of what pay was involved.</p>

  <p>There are no statistics available as yet to show how far this process has gone or
  what proportion of the profits are paid in the form of taxes to the Soviet government.
  It should be noted, however, that a resolution put before the Supreme Soviet in 1987 to
  tax the cooperatives 90% of their profits was rejected. It was the first time the
  Supreme Soviet had ever rejected a recommendation or proposal from the Party.
  Thereafter, it was reported that a lower tax had been passed. Of course, this is only
  in the service sector and in areas involving agriculture, food and related services.
  There is no way at the present time to accurately gauge the overall economic and social
  significance of this new departure.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it is a break with the past. And while it is true that those permitted
  to engage in these private cooperatives have to do so after regular working hours, on
  their own time, the main interest of the members of the cooperative will ultimately
  shift away from their regular jobs to the cooperative, which can generate profits and
  actually make the regular job superfluous.</p>

  <p>In his talk to a special Central Committee meeting on agriculture on October 12,
  1988, Gorbachev went over the subject of his agricultural schemes and touched on the
  question of the cooperatives.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="fst">... the cooperative movement in the country ... is also getting underway, gaining
    strength. Not everything is going smoothly. It turned out that some of our
    cooperators were not among our honest people who are indeed ready to display
    initiative, quick-wittedness, economic independence, and enterprise, to help society
    tackle many questions which the large enterprises are perhaps not up to. ... And it
    turned out that there were rogues among the cooperators, you know!<br /><br />

    A kind of public has turned up which, in point of fact, has obtained, in the form
    of the cooperative, an opportunity to legalize its illegal income and acquisitions in
    a dishonest way. And now it almost seems that they are going to flourish. All this is
    taking place, and do not think that we do not see it and do not know about it. We do.
    Everything is known, all the more so in the present-day glasnost.<br /><br />

    But we are not panicking, we are studying all these things. I don't think we
    should drag out the study of these problems; rather, we must find economic levers, to
    influence this type of phenomena.<sup><a href="#5.">5</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>But how, he did not say.</p>

  <p>So it turns out that the cooperatives are havens for rogues, for all sorts of
  dishonest elements who, having some illegal income which they acquired, are setting up
  cooperatives to fleece the public! Gorbachev expected them to display "initiative" and
  "quick-wittedness" as well as "economic independence," but found instead that they were
  mostly concerned with getting an opportunity to legalize illegal income.</p>

  <p>There are two separate elements involved in Gorbachev's admission regarding the
  cooperatives which are truly astonishing. The first is his disappointment with the
  character of the people who are swarming into them. Perhaps the most important thought
  one can gather from his talk is that he expected them to help society "tackle many
  questions which the large enterprises are perhaps not up to." What is Gorbachev
  expecting? That small enterprises can tackle the food and agricultural problems which
  large enterprises are incapable of handling? But this runs against the entire course of
  the historical evolution of agriculture, as well as industry, during the epoch of
  capitalism and in the early period of the Soviet Union itself.</p>

  <p>What did Marx write <em>Capital</em> for? To demonstrate that smaller units in
  industry and agriculture can do better than the larger ones? Is one to forget the
  entire history of capitalism, forget the concentration of capital into larger and
  larger units and especially the growth of such vast industries as automotive and
  agribusiness? Is Gorbachev attributing the agricultural crisis and the crisis of food
  supply to the fact that the collective and state farms are too large to be handled, so
  that it is now necessary to break them up into smaller units?</p>

  <p>One can make sense of this only if it is regarded as a purely administrative or
  organizational problem. One can easily see analogies with the giant corporations under
  capitalism, which often break up larger units into subdivisions. This happens time and
  again with IBM, General Motors, AT&amp;T, etc. But they all remain within the framework
  of private property and monopoly ownership by an ever more omnipotent cadre of the
  imperialist bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>But the private cooperatives, under the Gorbachev scheme, are a move away from
  socialist ownership and toward private ownership. Gorbachev's assurances that it is all
  done within the larger framework of socialism do little to mitigate the significance of
  this detour, this remarkable step backward, which is utterly inconsistent with
  socialist development.</p>

  <p>The cooperatives are a change in property forms. If this is what he wants to do,
  nothing is more important than to clarify the significance of the change. It is not
  merely a change of management, not just an "economic mechanism," as he puts it. It's a
  change in property forms, however minimal it may be at the present time. One form
  fosters bourgeois acquisitiveness and profiteering; the other is based on socialist
  solidarity. The fundamental advantage of the cooperatives would be if they facilitated
  and increased production. But if it turns out that they're just a haven for thieves,
  that negates the experiment altogether.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev promoters of private enterprise are very quick to bring up Lenin's
  famous article "On Cooperation" in which he proposed the development of a cooperative
  movement in the USSR in the very early 1920s.<sup><a href="#6.">6</a></sup> Lenin
  explained that cooperatives under capitalism were bourgeois mediums bereft of any kind
  of socialist perspective. They were justly denounced as instruments to divert the class
  struggle, he said again and again. While Lenin explained what cooperatives were in
  bourgeois society, he added that cooperatives in Soviet society, under the control of
  the workers' and peasants' government, under the control of the state, could play a
  highly progressive role in the construction of socialism.</p>

  <p>However, the problem was that the peasantry in the 1920s, before collectivization,
  fell into three groups: the poor peasants, who supported the Soviet government; the
  middle peasants, who were better off and made up the majority; and the rich kulaks, who
  were distinguished by their ability to hire labor power on their farms. It was the hope
  of the Soviet government that the cooperatives would attract the middle peasants and
  involve them eventually in the development of socialism. It was a particularly trying
  period in the building up of the Soviet industrial and technological infrastructure,
  which was small at that time and moreover had been battered by the Civil War and the
  sabotage of the overthrown bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>The middle peasants did not respond. They wanted nothing more than to be completely
  free to buy and sell as they saw fit in their own group interests. They did not want
  supervision or control by the state, even a Soviet state, and moreover a good many
  succumbed to whispering campaigns of the rich kulaks that the cooperatives were a
  Bolshevik trick to take away their land. Some cooperatives survived and supplemented
  socialist construction. But by and large a crisis in the relations between the
  peasantry and the government arose in the 1920s, particularly after Lenin's death.</p>

  <p>The three principal groupings in the Bolshevik Party, each with their own program,
  were: the right, headed by Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky; the left headed by Trotsky and
  the Left Opposition; and the centrist grouping headed by Stalin and his supporters. All
  realized that the current situation was untenable and required fundamental solutions to
  the growing contradiction between the urgent need to develop socialist industry and the
  position of the middle peasantry, which was orienting in a bourgeois direction.</p>

  <p>The cooperative movement did not take hold, precisely because the bulk of the middle
  peasantry, under the prompting of the kulaks, wanted to avoid any kind of restrictions.
  (This is in accordance with their historic role under capitalism, except that there
  they are ultimately subjected to the merchant, the usurer and the tax collector.) The
  so-called free peasantry wanted nothing more than a free capitalist market for their
  products. The poor peasants, however, especially at times of drought or other natural
  catastrophes, would get wiped out by the free market. The poor peasants were natural
  allies of the proletarian dictatorship in the agricultural sector.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev, in his promotion of the private cooperatives, idealizes them and
  exaggerates their social significance, forgetting the true lessons of the 1920s. Yet he
  has to admit himself that the cooperatives are nothing but havens for illegal
  profiteers. Moreover, they are roundly detested by the general public.</p>

  <p>If the main objective of the government is to stimulate what they call creative
  initiative by spurring on entrepreneurial instincts and even glorifying them, then this
  can only be to the detriment of socialist solidarity in the overall process of
  production in Soviet society.</p>

  <p>In the next article we will take up other economic mechanisms, such as the family
  farm and the contract brigade.</p>
