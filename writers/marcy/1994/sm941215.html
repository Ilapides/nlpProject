  <h1>Strategies for the struggle ahead</h1>

  <h2>Marxism and mass action</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Dec. 15, 1994)</h5>

  <p><em>This article is based on Sam Marcy's remarks to the Dec. 3-4, 1994, Workers
  World Party national conference in New York.</em></p>

  <p>The movement of the working class originated more than 150 years ago. We are the
  inheritors of not only the ideology but also the traditions of revolutionary
  Marxism.</p>

  <p>Our basic aim since the formation of the Party has been to resuscitate, revive and
  continue under new conditions the struggle against capitalism and imperialism.</p>

  <p>In this historic struggle for socialism, there have been two great and undeviating
  tendencies. They become evident, in one form or another, in every continent and every
  country.</p>

  <p>This struggle is over what tactics and strategy to employ. In Europe, one tendency
  in the socialist movement was led by Auguste Blanqui in France. The other was carried
  out later and with great success by Karl Marx.</p>

  <p>The proletarian movement has to review its historical heritage and go back to its
  roots to understand the complexities of modern imperialism.</p>

  <p>There are new forms of colonialism, a new rise of all sorts of oppression under
  capitalism, and a growing inevitability of imperialist conflicts, not only against the
  proletariat and oppressed peoples, but also among themselves.</p>

  <h4>Theory and action</h4>

  <p>Blanqui, unlike Marx, believed it wasn't necessary to theorize. Theoretical
  conceptions are fine, he said, but are not the motor force of the struggle. He stood
  for action &mdash; not by the masses but by a small group of knowledgeable, dedicated
  and revolutionary leaders intent on overthrowing the capitalist system.</p>

  <p>His view was that all the workers' struggles, some of which Marx had already
  explained and written about, ended up in failure because of the leadership's lack of
  determination and ability to master the art of conspiracy against the capitalist
  class.</p>

  <p>The masses are great, he said, but need leaders. Sometimes what has to be done to
  overturn the capitalist class need not necessarily be explained to the masses. Small
  groups of dedicated and revolutionary leaders must be educated and prepared; and it is
  they who, by their vision and ability, will overturn the capitalist system.</p>

  <p>This view is sometimes popularly known as "getting a few good men together" &mdash;
  never even thinking of mentioning women. The view may sound archaic but nevertheless it
  has prevailed for a long time. Think of the many coups d'etat of both a progressive and
  reactionary character that have taken place in our epoch.</p>

  <p>But even progressive coups, with all their fervor, their dedication, have been
  unable to overturn the capitalist system in any modern capitalist country.</p>

  <p>Blanqui would have been regarded as ridiculous were he not such a capable organizer.
  His "man of action" became a symbol for struggle rather than for prayer or
  theorizing.</p>

  <h4>Lenin on Blanqui</h4>

  <p>It was in the struggle between Marxism and Blanquism that Bolshevism was born. The
  old socialist movement had completely discarded any aspect of Blanqui's teaching on
  organizing smaller groups or differentiating between the great mass of the people and
  the more educated, developed smaller groups.</p>

  <p>In the old socialist and working-class parties in Europe, there was no clear-cut
  difference between the leadership and the masses. The leaders were selected from the
  masses. Blanqui's view was that it was a task of the small group not only to give
  leadership but to do it with firmness, not to hesitate.</p>

  <p>Blanquism was the theory of readiness, the vision of overthrowing capitalism not by
  legal or electoral means but by conspiracy.</p>

  <p>Any number of conspiracies took place in old Europe. They overturned this or that
  government. But they didn't overturn the system.</p>

  <p>Marxism had to take from Blanquism everything that was progressive and necessary and
  discard what was not useful. At the same time, it had to discard what was old and
  inapplicable in the old socialist movement.</p>

  <p>This was the task of Lenin and the Bolsheviks. They took the theoretical basis of
  Marxism and used it to educate the masses on the necessity for insurrection.</p>

  <p>Before Lenin, insurrection was not regarded by the socialist movement as either
  necessary or desirable. The social-democratic parties were dependent exclusively on the
  electoral process.</p>

  <p>Blanquism has to be distinguished from the old utopian movement, which was also
  fervently for socialism and for the masses &mdash; but had no vision of how it could be
  won, except by convincing the individual capitalists of the need to discard the system
  of capitalist oppression and institute the socialist system.</p>

  <p>The ideas of the old utopian socialists were not practical. The ideas of Blanquism
  were more attractive to the young. But at the same time they could not overturn the
  capitalist system.</p>

  <p>We have to bring this up because of the way the modern capitalist system is
  developing at this time.</p>

  <h4>What's next in U.S.?</h4>

  <p>In the modern-day U.S., what prevails is not the ideology of Blanqui or of Marx, but
  outright bourgeois ideology.</p>

  <p>But the system is rapidly coming to a point of great crisis, and it is necessary for
  us to review our heritage to understand the forthcoming period. It is necessary not
  merely to anticipate a revolutionary struggle but to prepare for it.</p>

  <p>In Marx's time, and even in Lenin's, the trade unions were considered the
  fundamental organ whereby the working class could organize itself. But the intervention
  of the world war showed that the slow process of winning the allegiance of the working
  class was illusory.</p>

  <p>No matter how dedicated or strong, a party like the German Social Democratic party
  would fail in the end, unless it had a revolutionary perspective of overthrowing the
  capitalist system, not hesitating to use force and violence when that became necessary.
  That aspect was not well understood by the other European parties in Lenin's time
  &mdash; only after the October Revolution in Russia.</p>

  <p>Today, many of the ideas proposed to solve capitalism's ills sound utopian in the
  old sense. They cannot overcome the system.</p>

  <p>It is quite likely that as soon as a struggle breaks out, it will produce a modern
  version of Blanquism, not only among the youth but in major organizations of the
  working class. One must consider the devastating and annihilating violence the state
  could conduct against the working class, and most often against Black and Latino and
  other oppressed nationalities.</p>

  <p>Our movement has to go back somewhat to an earlier epoch in order to understand what
  is developing in capitalist society today. We are witnessing a slow and gradual
  development. It seems that the revolutionary struggle is distant.</p>

  <p>But we know that a capitalist crisis, especially a severe one, immediately brings
  into being dozens of organizations with the most fantastic ideas on how to undo the
  capitalist crisis. Some lead to attempting a violent overthrow without the necessary
  preparation of the working class as the principal instrument for overcoming capitalist
  exploitation.</p>

  <p>In the coming struggle, we would have to pay attention to a possible Blanquist
  variant. But we would not be able to influence it unless our party itself is most
  vigorous, most relentless and most uncompromising in the struggle against capitalism
  and imperialism, of which, of course, racism is such a fundamental aspect.</p>

  <p>We have to prepare ourselves not only in the sense of gathering more forces but
  seeing what the future may hold ideologically. Our party has to restudy the basic
  classics of Marxism and go back to the theory and tactics that Lenin employed.</p>

  <h4>What to do next</h4>

  <p>The art of revolutionary politics is knowing what to do next. It is okay to theorize
  about fascism or the strength of the right wing. But our organization differs from a
  debating society. We must take a firm, indeed revolutionary, stance.</p>

  <p>We are faced with the growing prospect of right-wing conspiracy on the part of big
  business and the multinational corporations. They have taken the first step. This Rep.
  Newt Gingrich is a representative of it, and there are others &mdash; but that's not
  the main thing.</p>

  <p>Individuals can change, but the ruling class's trend is toward repression,
  solidifying in the most undemocratic way possible its control over the resources of the
  country and indeed of the globe. U.S. imperialism is on the march everywhere. The
  devastating results fall on the backs of the workers at home as well.</p>

  <p>What do we do? We know the right wing is moving, and that there is only a thin
  difference between the right and the ultra-right.</p>

  <p>One of the great lessons of the 1930s was Leon Trotsky's writings on the question of
  how to fight fascism. He stressed how important it is not to overlook what is
  happening, how it is possible to lose the historic moment and allow the ruling class to
  be victorious.</p>

  <p>He delineated in a dramatic and readable way the steps that led to the victory of
  fascism in Germany.</p>

  <p>In the U.S. at that time there were only the beginnings of fascist groupings. No
  sooner did the wave of reaction sweeping Europe reach these shores than the great
  sit-down strikes among the workers wiped them out completely.</p>

  <p>They were never able to get a foothold among the workers. The myriad of small
  fascist groups were washed away by the upsurge of the working class.</p>

  <p>That is the surest way to end any fascist attempt to establish itself as a political
  force over the working class.</p>

  <p>There's been no experience here with fascism on a mass scale. So we are basically
  looking at a theoretical and ideological discussion.</p>

  <p>Our task is not to wait until things happen, in which case you can be absolutely
  sure the liberal bourgeoisie as well as certain sections of the big bourgeoisie will
  get into it. Right now, the working class is either indifferent or apathetic in this
  great struggle.</p>

  <p>The possibility for the growth of neofascism, if you can call it that, and for
  political reaction generally is in the soil because monopoly is growing. The
  contradiction between the forms of capitalist production and the forms of capitalist
  distribution grows wider and wider.</p>

  <p>The struggle among the imperialist nations grows sharper. There is no tendency
  toward political equilibrium there.</p>

  <p>None of the small countries that were actual colonies and became independent has
  shown any move toward economic independence. They would like to do it but cannot
  because of the monstrous growth and position of the big banks and corporations over the
  entire planet.</p>

  <p>It is impossible for a small country to attain complete independence and at the same
  time grow economically strong and powerful. Not even Cuba can do that. We are all happy
  at the way it has conducted itself and won a position in world affairs and at home, but
  it is at great economic cost. Trying to get out of it little by little is
  difficult.</p>

  <p>Cuba should be able to look toward an emancipated working class in the U.S. to help
  it. That's our job.</p>

  <h4>Opportunity for a mass struggle</h4>

  <p>The right wing is on the march in the United States. But we now have a golden
  opportunity to intervene in the capitalist political process in a way we never have
  before.</p>

  <p>We can become the most formidable representatives of the working class in the
  struggle against political reaction, if we build beginning with what we have.</p>

  <p>A whole world of struggle awaits us. The false opposition, the false messiahs of
  struggle who are actually capitulators are not yet on the scene. We have a clear
  road.</p>

  <p>We are on the right path if we undertake a genuine, broad national opposition to the
  right wing and political reaction in general. It doesn't mean we leave the liberals off
  the hook. It doesn't mean we concentrate only on Gingrich or the others. It means we
  intensify our theoretical and political work.</p>

  <p>We need to show where this country is moving, where the capitalist class is leading
  it, what the tendencies in it are, what the dangers are. We need an outpouring of the
  workers and oppressed masses. We need to prepare for that.</p>

  <p>And we're in better shape because the liberal bourgeoisie is asleep and afraid. A
  part of it becomes ultra-militant and revolutionary after we start doing things, but
  for the time being they are asleep.</p>

  <p>We need to organize ourselves and make this the top priority in the organization and
  for our Party.</p>

  <p>We cannot start a serious campaign in the struggle against the far right without
  funds. We need full-time organizers, foot soldiers who can leave their jobs and go
  places and do things. The struggle can only come as a result of deeper self-sacrifice.
  The Party needs a fighting fund of hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

  <p>We have to expand before the storm comes. Our own resources are relatively small but
  will grow as the struggle widens and deepens.</p>

  <p>We can go to the masses and promote tremendous activity to challenge the capitalist
  class. We needn't be fearful about going beyond the legal limits that the bourgeoisie
  constrains us to. On a picket line you never know when you're going to get arrested,
  but you don't say don't have the picket line. That kind of talk leads to failure.</p>

  <p>We are taking on the greatest capitalist enemy. They have a president but they are
  having second thoughts about him.</p>

  <p>Clinton isn't any different than earlier Democratic presidents. What is different is
  the situation of the bourgeoisie. They push one right-wing economic and political
  measure after another. And he is not a president to resist.</p>

  <p>Should a capitalist economic crisis break out, it would accentuate the political
  crisis. If it catches us by surprise and we do not have an apparatus out in the field,
  then our hopes for building a strong and revolutionary organization will be
  considerably diminished until the next opportunity comes.</p>

  <p>In the 1930s, the Communist Party and other organizations were very conscious of the
  growth of fascism. But to a large extent they were trying to win the big bourgeoisie to
  support the struggle against it.</p>

  <p>There is nothing wrong with asking them to support the struggle against fascism, but
  it's another thing to expect it from them. We have to explain this to the most
  oppressed and persecuted people, in the Black and Native and Latino districts. Fascism
  should not be an after-dinner conversation with bourgeois liberals.</p>

  <p>The struggle against the far right and the struggle against racism are intimately
  interlocked.</p>

  <p>We have to get our paper and our literature into the hands of thousands of workers.
  And to do that we need organizers.</p>

  <p>We have to counteract the inroads of the capitalist monopolies. We have to support
  strikes and fight lockouts by employers. We have to redouble our activities on all
  fronts.</p>

  <p>Marxism is as Marxism does. It is not merely an exposition of the tendencies in
  capitalist society that inevitably lead it to destruction. It is also a means for
  arming the workers and oppressed people on how to proceed in the next period.</p>

  <p>Are we mainly directing our attention to the program of the right-wing Republicans?
  No. We shouldn't leave the other Republicans and the Democrats off the hook.</p>

  <p>To make it very clear, our struggle against the right wing is an extension of our
  general program and not some new development on our part. We are going to conduct a
  revolutionary and working-class struggle in the way we have conducted them before, with
  greater emphasis on developing an initiative in the struggle against the right wing and
  the neo-fascist tendencies that may spring up now and then.</p>
