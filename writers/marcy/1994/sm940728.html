  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Korea: the danger from without (July 28,

  <h1>Korea: the danger from without</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (July 28, 1994)</h5>

  <p>Once again, as happened over four decades ago, Korea is in the forefront of
  international news. As in the earlier period, the question is whether a war is in fact
  pending in that area of the world.</p>

  <p>Long after capitalism is abolished and its imperialist vestiges have been uprooted,
  people in the West will wonder why, for so long, Korea was discussed and written about
  only from the viewpoint of its strategic and military value. Its cultural significance
  and its rich history are rarely referred to except in history books and encyclopedias.
  Presumably, Korea's only historic significance is its strategic value to
  imperialism.</p>

  <p>Not only Korea is treated this way, of course. A host of other nations, large and
  small, are considered in bourgeois historiography only for their military significance
  or their deposits of valuable natural resources such as gold, silver, oil and, more
  recently, uranium.</p>

  <p>We must leave it to socialist historians to present a more progressive and
  revolutionary view of Korea. For now, let us consider the peninsula from the viewpoint
  of the danger it may face as a result of the imperialist bent toward adventurism.</p>

  <p>Some months ago the U.S. deployed a large Naval task force in the waters around
  Korea. There is no logical reason for this &mdash; except that imperialist strategy
  dictates that too long a period of peaceful relations may reflect itself in Pentagon
  cutbacks, most particularly in Naval expenditures.</p>

  <h4>Two Koreas?</h4>

  <p>In this context we have to consider what passes in imperialist journalism as the
  "problem of the two Koreas" &mdash; the socialist Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea
  in the north and the capitalist regime in the south. There would be no such problem had
  it not been for imperialist intervention, first by Japan, then by the Western
  imperialists headed by the U.S.</p>

  <p>That left Korea divided in two &mdash; as Germany was, as Ireland is today. The
  progress of capitalist development over a long period led to the unifications and
  divisions that currently exist on a global scale.</p>

  <p>In the case of divided Korea, the task of anti-imperialist and progressive forces is
  not to heedlessly promote either separatism or unity but to consider most seriously how
  to rid Korea of imperialist influence altogether, so as to give the people a chance to
  determine their own form of national development.</p>

  <p>The present period is of exceptional importance because of the death of President
  Kim Il Sung, the long-time leader of the DPRK who guided revolutionary Korea and
  developed it as a socialist country. The DPRK may face a danger from without for no
  other reason than that the imperialists may be tempted to take advantage of a
  transition period in the government in order to strengthen their own ambitions.</p>

  <p>However, the Workers Party of Korea has been preparing for this transition for some
  time. There is nothing in the record that would cast any doubt on the new leadership to
  be selected by the Korean Workers Party. As much as they try, the imperialist media
  cannot produce credible evidence of an internal struggle in Korea that could be grist
  to their mill.</p>

  <p>As the progressive and anti-imperialist forces throughout the world should expect,
  the south Korean puppets of U.S. imperialism have done their best to utilize this
  period to deride both Kim Il Sung and the person expected to succeed him, Kim Jong Il.
  The latter has been taking on greater positions of responsibility in the party,
  government and military.</p>

  <p>The Seoul authorities are responding to the promptings of U.S. imperialism, which
  wants to poison the atmosphere of friendly relations developing between the people of
  north and south. If anything proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that the south Korean
  leaders are merely puppets, it is that they have not abided by the most elementary
  norms of diplomatic courtesy &mdash; even those that the imperialists apply during such
  periods &mdash; and have refused to send a message of condolence to the north.</p>

  <p>This indicates they are isolated from the mass of the people and fearful that any
  demonstration of respect for Korea's revolutionary leaders will encourage real
  unification on the basis of popular support for the program and leadership in the
  north.</p>
