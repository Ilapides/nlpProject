  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Greenspan visit causing jitters (March 31,
  1994)</title>

  <h1>Greenspan visit causing jitters</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 31, 1994)</h5>

  <p><em>[ed. note: unsigned editorial]</em></p>

  <p>The repercussions of a March 18 closed-door meeting at the White House raised
  questions about the stability of the capitalist economy. At the meeting were President
  Clinton, Chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan and some of Clinton's close
  economic advisers.</p>

  <p>The Federal Reserve Board chair is supposed to stay away from all capitalist
  politicians unless he is called by a Congressional committee to testify. He is only
  supposed to meet with the president at scheduled meetings when the press and the
  appropriate Congressional committees are notified.</p>

  <p>So when word got out that Greenspan snuck into a meeting though a side door, it sent
  a tremor through Wall Street.</p>

  <p>A capitalist government serves the ruling class by anticipating dangers to the
  economy. It tries to divert the results of such developments so that they will not
  damage the administration and turn into an economic disaster. Does the March 18 meeting
  mean that the Clinton administration foresees such a crisis and is taking steps to
  avert it? Apparently many on Wall Street think so.</p>

  <p>At the present time, the ruling class is pondering what will happen in the event the
  economy crashes. What political strategies should they use under the circumstances?
  Should they, under the circumstances, blame everything on the administration?</p>

  <p>A close reading of the imperialist financial press both abroad and here shows that
  they see for the future negative economic developments. They are not expecting a big or
  bigger upturn than they have now. Their policy is to use preventive medicine in order
  to make whatever happens easier to cope with.</p>

  <p>The majority of capitalist economists are saying prepare for a collapse, an economic
  disaster.</p>

  <p>With the support of Congress, the Clinton administration might be capable of taking
  initiatives that could temporarily stave off an economic crisis. In that case it could
  continue to rule. But the Clinton administration does not have significant allies in
  Congress who will follow its lead, not even within the Democratic Party.</p>

  <p>All this is an indication not only of nervousness in the upper echelons of the
  capitalist government, but also of turmoil based on the uncertain economic situation.
