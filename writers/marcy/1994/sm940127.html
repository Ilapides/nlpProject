  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Why Gaidar was ousted (Jan. 27, 1994)</title>

  <h1>Why Gaidar was ousted</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Jan. 27, 1994)</h5>

  <p>The resignation of Yegor Gaidar from his post as first deputy prime minister is an
  objective revelation. It shows that the attempt to impose a thorough bourgeois economy
  on the former USSR is meeting with formidable obstacles that cannot be overcome by mere
  sleight-of-hand economic maneuvers.</p>

  <p>In the final analysis, the struggle comes down to this: Which class will be saddled
  with the burden that accompanies the introduction of a thorough capitalist economy in
  Russia?</p>

  <p>Since the Gorbachev era began, Gaidar has become the principal link between the
  imperialist bankers and the Russian bourgeoisie. As a capitalist politician and the
  leader of the party calling itself Russia's Choice, he stands next to President Boris
  Yeltsin in the esteem of the imperialist bourgeoisie.</p>

  <h4>Clinton's meeting with Yeltsin</h4>

  <p>When U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in Moscow to meet with Yeltsin, it was for
  the purpose of shoring up Yeltsin's political strength and demonstrating the U.S.
  government's and ruling class's concern over the progress of the so-called reforms to
  introduce a full-scale capitalist economy in the former USSR.</p>

  <p>If Clinton's visit was to be more than a goodwill gesture toward Yeltsin, proper
  diplomatic procedure would have dictated that Clinton and Yeltsin include in their
  discussions the principal proponent of the bourgeois restoration, the one considered in
  the imperialist West to be the key in promoting the vandalizing and dismantling of
  socialist enterprises. That person is Gaidar.</p>

  <p>But Clinton avoided such a meeting, for it would have meant a review of the economic
  problems in the former USSR. Gaidar would have presented Clinton with a description of
  the perilous state of the economy as a whole. The U.S. could have concluded such a
  meeting only by acceding to more loans and grants and encouraging the imperialist
  allies to do likewise.</p>

  <p>Instead, Clinton made his visit a mere goodwill gesture to Yeltsin. He left abruptly
  without meeting with the principal proponent of the very capitalist restructuring of
  Russia that the imperialist West is looking for.</p>

  <p>So it was really inevitable that Gaidar would resign his post and charge publicly
  that under the conditions now prevailing in Russia (really the inability of the Yeltsin
  government to continue its vandalizing of socialist industry), rampant inflation is
  absolutely inevitable.</p>

  <p>Gaidar is a staunch opponent of any and all kinds of social benefits such as
  increases in unemployment insurance. He sounds just like the conservatives in the West
  who say that social benefits feed inflation while increases in super-profits do
  not.</p>

  <p>There is no question that not only Yeltsin but also Gaidar have read the results of
  the parliamentary election in December. It clearly indicated the disenchantment of the
  masses with the economic policies of the Yeltsin counter-revolutionary regime.</p>

  <h4>No inflation under USSR</h4>

  <p>How to rein in inflation without coming into collision with the masses is the
  problem of problems of a bourgeois regime, whether it be fascist, militarist or
  democratic in character.</p>

  <p>But why look abroad for examples of how to deal with inflation when a truly shining
  example can be found in the history of the USSR itself? Only a few years after the 1917
  workers' and peasants' revolution and the destruction caused by the ensuing civil war,
  the Soviet government was able to eliminate inflation by lifting the living standards
  of the masses, not depressing them. The scourge of inflation was successfully avoided
  with the beginning of the planned economy and socialist construction.</p>

  <p>That is what made it possible for the USSR to have a stable currency for many
  decades. Even if the Soviet government could not get the imperialist West to accept the
  ruble for some years, it was acceptable to the masses at home because of its
  reliability as a stable currency.</p>

  <p>The Yeltsin government can't do this. It is fearful of the masses, especially since
  the recent election, and is seeking any and all avenues to obtain loans and credits
  from the West. It hopes thereby to avoid the harsh measures that will be necessary if
  this counter-revolutionary government is to carry out capitalist restoration.</p>

  <p>However, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the two agencies that
  have sanctioned loans on previous occasions, are not likely to do it again this time.
  After all, the principal guardian of the bourgeois economy has resigned his post in
  disgust over the inability of the Yeltsin government to carry forward the capitalist
  restoration with the kind of speed that is necessary to restore the confidence of the
  world imperialist banking system.</p>

  <h4>Only two choices</h4>

  <p>Clearly, the Yeltsin administration is coming to a fork in the road.</p>

  <p>They could go whole-hog in support of capitalist restoration, which would require a
  readiness to take on the mass anger provoked by the resulting devastating layoffs and
  cutbacks.</p>

  <p>Or they could throw overboard the rotten cargo of bourgeois economics and return to
  orthodox socialist planning, at least as it existed in the 1960s when the Soviet
  economy was considered second only to that of the U.S. in terms of reliably repaying
  credits and loans. The imperialist banks at that time rivaled one another in attempting
  to extend loans and credit to the Soviet government.</p>

  <p>But can the Yeltsin government of the bourgeoisie, which has repressed those
  fighting against capitalist reaction, now successfully appeal to the masses, reject the
  road of bourgeois restoration, and go back to socialist construction? From all
  appearances, this would be an utterly incredible turnabout on the part of the Yeltsin
  regime.</p>

  <p>They would first of all have to open the prisons and release all those they have
  jailed!</p>

  <p>If Yeltsin were to assume such an extraordinary posture, what would it mean? In
  terms of historical analogies, it would be playing Bonapartist politics. A Bonapartist
  regime moves from one class camp to another, but not out of loyalty to either one,
  while it relies on the military and the police as its fundamental support.</p>

  <p>Can such a position last for any length of time? Only if class antagonisms soften.
  Such an eventuality could only happen if there were a vast and rapid economic
  improvement. Where would that come from? Yeltsin would have to retrace his steps. It's
  a very, very unlikely situation.</p>

  <p>The political situation in the former USSR cries out for a return to socialist
  construction. And that can be guaranteed only by the formidable emergence of a
  reorganized communist movement that has been reformed in a revolutionary direction.</p>

  <p>Therein lies the hope for the socialist regeneration of what used to be the Union of
  Soviet Socialist Republics.</p>
