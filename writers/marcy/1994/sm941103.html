  <h1>Monopoly and U.S. policy on Iraq</h1>

  <h2>Behind the vendetta</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Nov. 3, 1994)</h5>

  <p><em>The following article is based on a speech to a Workers World Party meeting on
  Iraq, Oct. 22, 1994.</em></p>

  <p>The crisis arising out of the struggle with Iraq is really one of many that have
  characterized the latter part of the 20th century.</p>

  <p>Iraq in and of itself is a small country. Notwithstanding all the wealth it is
  reputed to have in the form of oil, it is a poor country, as are most of the Middle
  Eastern countries.</p>

  <p>There are very few so-called rich countries. They're in the West, with the
  exception, of course, of Japan.</p>

  <p>For us to understand the nature of the crisis, it's most important to go to its very
  roots. According to bourgeois historiography, which is so prevalent nowadays, it's a
  struggle between nations. Sometimes they characterize it as a struggle between the poor
  nations and the rich nations, or between the Third World nations and the Western
  nations. They rarely if ever admit that in reality it's a struggle between classes
  masked as one between nations.</p>

  <p>What are its roots?</p>

  <h4>Socialist theory before Lenin</h4>

  <p>Beginning around the turn of the century, the socialist press devoted a great deal
  of discussion to the meaning of the latest phase of capitalism. What did it mean that
  recessions were getting less frequent while the periods of capitalist prosperity seemed
  to last longer? What did it mean that while there was a great threat of war, no big
  wars had broken out?</p>

  <p>Didn't all this tend to mean that socialism was not really the answer, was not
  inevitable?</p>

  <p>In the period beginning around 1900, the class struggle as such seemed to be waning
  in most of the European countries. There was also a decline in theoretical thinking and
  writing &mdash; with the exception of the Russians and, of course, the left wing of
  German Social Democracy.</p>

  <p>What occupied the minds of the best and most educated theoreticians in the
  working-class movement of that time was how to get out of the period of passivity that
  was hindering the revolutionization of the working class. Why were things moving so
  slowly?</p>

  <p>Of course, by our standards today it might have seemed like a period of glorious
  revolutionary struggles. But as to expecting socialist revolution and the overthrow of
  the capitalist system, that seemed to have waned.</p>

  <p>Most of the socialist writers seemed to accommodate themselves to the perspective
  that there was going to be a period of evolutionary growth limited to electoral
  successes in the parliament or congress, in the trade unions and so on.</p>

  <p>What wasn't really expected, even though it was talked about a great deal, was that
  the accumulation and containment of smaller capitalist economic crises would break out
  in a very big political crisis. But this is exactly what happened. It took the form of
  a world conflagration of immense and incalculable damage and destruction &mdash; World
  War I.</p>

  <h4>Impact of world war</h4>

  <p>So while socialists everywhere had expected the decline and fall of capitalism, it
  didn't take the form they had anticipated. It took the form of a violent struggle that
  wiped out millions of people.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, after a lot of destruction and human sacrifice, it led to the workers
  establishing their own state in Russia and other parts of the world, opening up a new
  epoch of revolutionary struggle.</p>

  <p>Why were the socialist leaders slow to grasp the essence of the historical process
  at the time?</p>

  <p>It is partly because there was no comprehension of the meaning of modern
  imperialism. For the most part, imperialism was thought to mean aggression by big
  states against small ones, or against oppressed countries. Imperialism meant
  overreaching by one nation against another or the taking of privileges by rich and
  powerful nations against small ones.</p>

  <p>But that was a very superficial understanding and analysis. The really important
  analysis of imperialism didn't come until 1916, with the publication of Lenin's
  pamphlet, "Imperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism." I should add in defense of
  the Social Democrats, particularly the left wing in Germany, that they had a fairly
  broad and comprehensive understanding of imperialism, but did not link it to the class
  struggle in the way Lenin did.</p>

  <h4>Imperialism and monopoly</h4>

  <p>And imperialism is what we want to discuss in relation to Iraq. I think by this time
  we all understand who the aggressor is in Iraq and who we defend. For this audience, we
  should deal with the broader causes. We should understand the essence of imperialism,
  and that is monopoly. Monopoly is as important today as it was in 1916 when Lenin
  wrote.</p>

  <p>We think of monopoly as control and domination by one or two corporations or one or
  two countries. But that is only one aspect of it, and not the most important.</p>

  <p>The important thing to understand is the monopoly over the means of production by
  one class over another. This is not what bourgeois texts explain. Many books are
  written on monopoly, about how one corporation, like Exxon or IBM, outdistances
  another, how several groups unite against each other, how they dissolve and regroup
  again.</p>

  <p>But this avoids the singularly significant and socially most important aspect of
  monopoly. It avoids dealing with the ownership of the means of production by one class
  as against another.</p>

  <h4>Iraq vs. imperialism</h4>

  <p>When we come to Iraq, we have to understand our fundamentals first. In approaching
  the phenomenon of this small country, the fundamental fact is that the means of
  production on a world scale are owned by the imperialist ruling class. That includes
  the military means and all the civil industries. It is control by the ruling class as
  against the working class and the oppressed masses.</p>

  <p>The idea that a small country can stand up against a group of the large imperialists
  over a protracted period is just not correct from the point of view of history. From
  the point of view of revolutionary struggle, we hope it can amass large and significant
  allies in order to be able to throw over a ruling class.</p>

  <p>So the crisis in Iraq is a small crisis generated by a larger one. The larger crisis
  flows from the antagonism between the ownership of private property by the capitalist
  ruling class and the fact that all the instruments of production are socially and
  collectively produced by another class, the working class.</p>

  <p>Iraq is a small country. So is Iran. But Belgium is also a small country. Compared
  to China, India or Indonesia, France and Germany are small countries. But by virtue of
  the ownership of the means of production on a world scale, they are considered in some
  quarters as virtually omnipotent.</p>

  <p>So to analyze the crisis in Iraq, to know where it comes from, we must see it as
  part of the world capitalist crisis and the possibility of capitalist stability
  existing for only a short time.</p>

  <h4>Rebellion of the productive forces</h4>

  <p>Our view of the class struggle negates any possibility of really prolonged and
  permanent stability of the capitalist system. Marxism breathes the fire of rebellion,
  not only of the masses but of the productive forces against the private ownership of
  the means of production.</p>

  <p>This is what we have to consider in connection with the Middle East and the growth
  in militarism by the imperialist bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>We have to put the struggle in Iraq and the struggles by other oppressed countries
  in the context of the period through which we are passing. It is a period when the
  passivity of the working class is still a fundamental factor but when the growth of the
  productive forces is so immense that it is bound to destabilize every social and
  political organization, not only of the bourgeoisie but of the proletariat as well.</p>

  <p>This is a period in which the working class has to arm itself politically. It's
  important that when we talk about imperialism or about the struggle of any oppressed
  country against imperialism, we take into account Lenin's analysis of it, written in
  1916, just a year before the Russian Revolution broke out and two years after World War
  I had begun.</p>

  <p>Unlike the others who analyzed monopoly, he linked it to the class struggle for the
  proletarian revolution. He saw monopoly as a factor that would lead to the proletarian
  revolution and not as something that would stifle the class struggle forever or keep
  the working class from breathing the free air &mdash; free in the sense of a class
  struggle where the workers can participate unhindered.</p>

  <p>At the present time, we cannot understand Iraq as a phenomenon divorced from the
  revolutionary struggle of the oppressed people or from the latent class struggle of the
  workers in the imperialist countries.</p>

  <p>It has been several years since the Western proletariat entered on the arena of
  struggle, but it is in preparation for doing so. If we view the struggle of the
  oppressed masses as in a way preparatory to the revolutionary struggle of the workers
  in the imperialist countries, we will get the gist of Lenin's position on
  imperialism.</p>

  <p>When Lenin was writing "Imperialism," it was still a period of passivity in the
  metropolitan capitalist countries. The movement there had begun to view the class
  struggle in terms of electoral stages devoid of the great revolutionary upheavals of
  the 1848 type. It was believed that the working class was destined to go through a long
  period of parliamentary struggle without a revolutionary outbreak of the class
  struggle.</p>

  <h4>War and revolution</h4>

  <p>That did not take into account the effects of an imperialist war. Those who were
  counting on the passivity of the working class were in reality limiting Marxism to a
  classical type of struggle without taking into account its revolutionary potential.</p>

  <p>Take the situation in the United States. To some extent, it was a period of
  progressive labor struggles led by eminent and really militant socialists like Eugene
  Debs. But they didn't have the vision that a revolutionary overturn might be imminent
  because of the imperialist war, nor was such expected. It was not expected in Europe
  either, except by the small group of revolutionaries led by Lenin, Karl Liebknecht and
  Rosa Luxemburg.</p>

  <p>Our birthright rests upon understanding Marxist doctrine as facilitating the
  overturn of capitalism, not merely explaining its abstract laws.</p>

  <p>Many socialists before Lenin, including quite a few in the United States, explained
  the abstract laws of Marxism very well. And those books are still valid today. But they
  neglected to show that the dynamics of capitalist recession, the constant development
  from one capitalist crisis to another, would lead to a revolutionary struggle.</p>

  <h4>Foreign and domestic policy</h4>

  <p>What this signifies for us in relation to Iraq is that the U.S. is not resigned to
  recognizing the validity of Iraqi self-determination. At the present moment the
  situation seems to be a stalemate, but it would be foolish to regard it as such because
  the organic tendency of monopoly capitalism is to grab whatever it can. It cannot be
  satisfied with a standstill agreement because the productive forces are growing
  constantly, changing the social relations. These circumstances lead either to a
  socialist revolutionary struggle or to monopoly capitalism in another stage of
  development.</p>

  <p>Our hopes of a revival of the class struggle in the United States cannot of course
  rest solely on the international situation and the complications the Pentagon has in
  relation to it. Our analysis leads us to project that the class struggle in the United
  States will develop internally, regardless of the international complications, and will
  impart to them a richer, far more developed form of class struggle.</p>

  <p>Our policy must be to constantly show the relationship between the domestic struggle
  and its international implications.</p>

  <p>For a long time, even in the minds of the bourgeoisie, the domestic struggle seemed
  to be in one arena and foreign policy in another, completely divorced from it. But
  recent developments show that domestic and international affairs are part and parcel of
  the same class policy pursued by imperialism.</p>

  <p>A socialist form of government would pursue a domestic and foreign policy based on
  quite the opposite &mdash; the interests of the workers' state.</p>
