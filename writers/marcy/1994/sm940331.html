  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Korea, the Pentagon and the nuclear issue (March 31,
  1994)</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Korea, the Pentagon and the nuclear issue</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 31, 1994)</h5>

  <p>All facts and personages of great importance in world history, wrote Karl Marx in
  <em>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte,</em> occur twice: the first time as
  tragedy and the second as farce.</p>

  <p>The 1950-53 Korean War and the attempt of the U.S. to begin the subjugation of the
  Asian continent can only be regarded as a great tragic event, considering the millions
  of casualties in the struggle. On the U.S. side alone, there were more than 50,000
  deaths.</p>

  <p>But now comes the attempt of the U.S. government to cast the Democratic Peoples
  Republic of Korea &mdash; the socialist government in the north &mdash; in the role of
  a villain attempting to subjugate south Korea. What a farce that is! It is one of those
  flights of imagination permissible to novelists, perhaps, but not historians.</p>

  <p>At the present moment, the U.S. is resorting to truly desperate means to try and
  demonstrate that the DPRK is engaged, both secretly and overtly, in a villainous scheme
  to become a nuclear power without the authorization of Washington and Wall Street.</p>

  <h4>What is the IAEA?</h4>

  <p>What is the truth about the controversy between the U.S. and the DPRK?</p>

  <p>Some years ago, the U.S. decided to set up an international committee whose purpose
  was to monitor nuclear technology that had a potential for developing weapons. The U.S.
  persuaded such imperialist powers as Britain and France to be part of it, and included
  most Western capitalist countries.</p>

  <p>This International Atomic Energy Agency over a period of time took upon itself
  powers not defined at the time of its formation, powers that no government has
  delegated to it. Its finances come from the contributions of the capitalist powers.</p>

  <p>Slowly, it became an agency that not merely gathered technical and scientific
  information to be made available to the world, but that also demanded of non-nuclear
  powers information and reports on the status of their atomic capability.</p>

  <p>Insofar as this was confined to the capitalist world, mostly the imperialist powers,
  it aroused little attention. But when the IAEA began to take upon itself the
  responsibility for monitoring the oppressed Third World countries, its purpose as an
  arm of imperialism came out in the open.</p>

  <p>It is to the good fortune of China that it has been a strong and vigorous socialist
  state and was able to withstand the Korean War without being subjected to an invasion
  by the U.S. However, no peace agreement was ever signed between the U.S. and the DPRK.
  The Pentagon kept 40,000 troops stationed permanently in the south of Korea, and the
  threat of renewed fighting was always present.</p>

  <p>When China announced in 1964 that it had exploded an atomic bomb, it seemingly
  shocked the whole world. But in reality there was jubilation among oppressed
  countries.</p>

  <p>When it was announced at a memorable UN session, representatives of Third World
  countries literally jumped to their feet with joy. China had accomplished what the
  imperialists had tried in every way to obstruct. The imperialists had no alternative
  but to accept China as a nuclear power.</p>

  <p>Do the imperialist powers still have the political authority, for example through
  the UN, to obstruct an oppressed country from achieving its own nuclear capability
  without the authorization of Washington and Wall Street?</p>

  <p>The DPRK has reached a state in its economic and industrial-technological
  development where it can move rather rapidly in the field of nuclear development, and
  has done so in the field of nuclear power. It may possibly have the ability to develop
  a nuclear bomb.</p>

  <h4>Sovereignty of DPRK</h4>

  <p>The DPRK, among other Third World countries, had agreed to give the IAEA information
  and allow the agency to inspect its nuclear premises. But it is strictly up to Korea to
  decide how far foreign capitalist representatives may go in inspecting nuclear
  facilities in its own country.</p>

  <p>The DPRK has been cooperative with the IAEA, up to a point. But in the opinion of
  the Koreans, these inspectors, all of them from the capitalist West, then began to go
  further than what the Korean government had agreed was necessary to fulfill its
  obligations under the IAEA agreement.</p>

  <p>It would have been right and proper at that point for these inspectors to abide by
  the Korean decision. And it was essential for the Western capitalist countries to
  respect the Korean decision. The Korean government is the ultimate authority on who
  comes and goes to inspect any of the facilities in the DPRK, nuclear or otherwise. This
  is necessary to sustain its sovereign status as an independent country.</p>

  <p>Who, then, is opposing all this? The U.S. government, and most prominently and
  vociferously the Pentagon, supported by the State Department.</p>

  <p>What are they up to? A rerun of the Korean War?</p>

  <p>The U.S. government was able to corral, confuse, bamboozle and in every way lie
  about who started the fighting in Korea in 1950. It spread fear and confusion in the
  world media that the USSR and People's China had instigated the DPRK to commence the
  struggle and were setting the stage for "a classic battle between communism and
  freedom."</p>

  <p>Under present circumstances, such deception is not available to the U.S. government.
  China has its own independent position in foreign affairs. Its relation to the DPRK is
  conducted as that of a friendly neighbor, if not a socialist ally.</p>

  <p>So far as the USSR is concerned, it is gone. The influence of Russia as a bourgeois
  state is at the present time minimal in Korea.</p>

  <p>So the Pentagon has succumbed to the dream of corralling the entire Korean peninsula
  as a stepping stone to a new phase in its attempt to take over the Asian mainland.</p>

  <p>It is from this world perspective that we have to understand the position of the
  DPRK in guarding its own sovereignty and not succumbing to either the wiles or the
  military threats of the U.S.</p>

  <p>In a socialist order, the exchange of vital technical and scientific data is the ABC
  of friendship and fraternal relations. Under imperialism, it can easily become the
  pivot for a world conflagration.</p>

  <p>This is what has to be watched in the case of Korea. The progressive and working
  class forces in this country have to support the just cause of the DPRK. In doing so
  they are defending the most vital interests of the working class and oppressed masses
  right here.</p>
