  <h1>Movement must analyze catastrophe in USSR</h1>

  <h2>Marcy at seminar of Marxist-Leninists</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (May 19, 1994)</h5>

  <p><em>Sam Marcy, Chairperson of Workers World Party, delivered the following statement
  on May 4, 1994, to a session of the International Seminar of Marxist-Leninist Parties
  and Organizations in Brussels, Belgium.</em></p>

  <p>We are submitting this statement in the hope it will contribute to a fuller
  discussion of the basic issue for our epoch &mdash; namely, what is the meaning of the
  collapse of the USSR?</p>

  <p>There can be no question that this is the most important of all political issues. It
  would serve no purpose to shove it under the rug, even if that could be done, because
  the imperialist bourgeoisie and their kept press and media will invariably bring it up
  again and again. The movement would be defenseless without a thought-out approach to
  combat the propaganda of the bourgeoisie and their social-democratic helpers.</p>

  <p>It is first necessary to understand that the contemporary struggle reduces itself in
  essence to a struggle between two diametrically opposed social systems based on two
  mutually antagonistic class structures.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to have a discussion about the class struggle and the road to
  socialism unless we have some definite, although unfinished, view of Russia today and
  of how the greatest and most profound social and political revolution has been
  undone.</p>

  <p>It would be most unfortunate if the discussion reduced itself to merely a defense of
  the positions of Stalin, Trotsky, Mao or others. Their importance in the historic
  evolution of the communist movement will not suffer if we proceed according to an
  evaluation of political and theoretical concepts, rather than the individual leaders
  who may stand for them. To do otherwise is not worthy of revolutionary communists who
  are seriously attempting to find their way out of the catastrophic predicament in which
  all socialists and revolutionary Marxist-Leninists in particular find themselves
  today.</p>

  <p>Attributing the catastrophic destruction of the USSR solely to the policies of
  individual leaders, or even to a collection of them, is contrary to the materialist
  interpretation of history.</p>

  <p>The ancient slave system, for example, produced many brilliant leaders. The
  bourgeois historians attribute the decline and fall of the Roman Empire to the fault of
  these leaders.</p>

  <p>But what do Marxists say about the relation of these leaders to the ancient Roman
  and Greek empires? That slavery was becoming an outmoded social system. It was not the
  leaders who caused the collapse of these empires. It was the decay of slavery.</p>

  <p>Bourgeois historiography puts the subjective causes first. They regard slavery,
  feudalism and especially capitalism as eternal categories. But the internal struggles
  of the leaders, the murders, the poisonings, all this symbolized the decay of the
  institution of slavery.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, we don't want to deny the role of leadership. Leadership is crucial
  when the objective situation is ripe.</p>

  <p>But leadership is not a substitute for the class. All history attests to that.</p>

  <p>According to Marxist doctrine, no social system ever passes away without first fully
  exhausting its possibilities. The USSR had not exhausted its possibilities for growth.
  Its growth was aborted by a combination of internal corrosion and external
  pressures.</p>

  <p>Does the collapse of the USSR undermine the nature of the contemporary struggle in
  capitalist society?</p>

  <p>Of course, the overthrow of the Soviet Union enormously strengthened the power of
  capital all over the world, if only by virtue of the fact that it removed an enormous
  source of revolutionary energy, encouragement and material aid to the proletariat,
  oppressed peoples and all socialist countries.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it must be very clearly affirmed that the nature of the class struggle
  as outlined by Marx in the Communist Manifesto remains wholly valid today.</p>

  <p>The inevitability of the dictatorship of the proletariat on a world scale remains
  valid, despite the defeat in the USSR.</p>

  <p>The main thing is to identify the basic forces in contemporary society. These still
  are the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. And what Marx said about them in 1848 is still
  basically true.</p>

  <p>Should we return to Marx's concept of the class struggle as outlined in the
  Communist Manifesto? That would also entail and fortify an understanding of the
  dictatorship of the proletariat as the rule of the workers and oppressed masses.</p>

  <p>The need is for all revolutionary communists to unite on the basis of a common
  struggle against capitalist exploitation and imperialist oppression. It is not
  necessary for any grouping to abandon its propaganda in support of the views of
  individual leaders.</p>

  <p>What is needed is the broadest united front of revolutionary communist groupings, as
  long as they adhere to the spirit of revolutionary class struggle as generally promoted
  by Lenin in his writings on admission to the Communist International.</p>

  <p>In the course of further discussion, we will surely find out where we stand and how
  to continue the struggle for revolutionary Marxism-Leninism in this very difficult
  period.</p>

  <p>The name of Lenin is a kind of synonym for revolutionary class struggle. The failure
  to agree on that is in reality a line of demarcation between communism and social
  democracy, with its various hues.</p>

  <p>It would be a great achievement to be able to set aside secondary aspects and unite
  on the general understanding of the nature of our epoch and the tasks of the working
  class and the oppressed masses.</p>

  <p>We must affirm in the strongest terms that the present expansionist period of U.S.
  monopoly capital is the most dangerous and aggressive since the collapse of the USSR.
  But the disintegration of the socialist camp does not necessarily add up to permanent
  stability for imperialism. It is unable to stabilize itself and the unbridled forces of
  capitalist production lead it inevitably into a new crisis.</p>

  <p>What the collapse of the USSR confirms is that the world center of economic activity
  is and has remained in the imperialist countries &mdash; the "West" &mdash; whereas the
  revolutionary center of gravity has been in the "East" &mdash; the oppressed nations of
  the world, the bulk of humanity.</p>

  <p>But today the material foundations are being laid for a return of revolutionary
  activity to the West.</p>

  <p>The further development of monopoly capitalism in this stage will inevitably produce
  devastating convulsions within the imperialist system.</p>

  <p>The present so-called capitalist prosperity in the United States, which the Clinton
  administration in particular is so boastful of, rests on a decrepit foundation. It
  conceals the extent of capitalist overproduction and the enormous debt that U.S.
  capitalist expansion has incurred.</p>

  <p>For the moment, the analysts of imperialist finance capital have neglected to call
  this to the attention of the broad public. Such revelations coming at a time of high
  confidence could prove devastating to the so-called financial community.</p>

  <p>It may be 1929 all over again. Whether this period is of a shorter or longer
  duration is impossible to say. What we have to prepare for is the next phase in this
  development. We must not be caught off-guard.</p>

  <p>Holding a firm position on the nature of monopoly capitalism &mdash; which, as Lenin
  pointed out, is really the precursor for socialist revolution &mdash; we can only view
  the future with confidence.</p>
