  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Giuliani and the banks (April 14, 1994)</title>

  <h1>Giuliani and the banks</h1>

  <h2>The case of the missing $200 million</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 14, 1994)</h5>

  <p>This might have made a very interesting story in the heat of last fall's New York
  City election campaign between Rudolph Giuliani and then-Mayor David Dinkins &mdash;
  had the capitalist press wanted to make it so. But now, considering all other events,
  it's probably more fit for the Post Office dead letter department than anything
  else.</p>

  <p>Except for one thing &mdash; the New York Times suddenly dredged it up on April 2.
  It was now front-page news. The headline read, "Giuliani secures up to $200 million for
  buyout plan."</p>

  <p>During the election campaign this $200 million, which the city had saved at the cost
  of depriving the masses of vital social services, had been regarded as something like
  the Holy Grail. It couldn't be touched. It had to be kept safe and secure, especially
  from the hands of the greedy politicians, by the cabal of bankers that controls the
  Municipal Assistance Corporation. MAC's leading light for years was Felix Rohatyn.</p>

  <p>The Rohatyn leadership has now been succeeded by a grouping of Republican experts.
  Their solicitude for the welfare of the poor is even greater than that of their
  Democratic opponents.</p>

  <p>But after all the precautions and rigid rules for safekeeping the Holy Grail, this
  $200 million has now been opened up. And it's in the hands of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
  and the others &mdash; who had pledged not to touch a penny of it. But that was
  before.</p>

  <p>How would an ordinary worker understand this matter of the lost and found $200
  million? Simple: It comes from the taxes on the workers; it comes out of their pockets.
  It's the city treasury. In a democratic society the money would be controlled by the
  city council.</p>

  <p>But nothing could be further from reality. The money is in the hands of the
  Municipal Assistance Corporation &mdash; set up years ago, when the city had a
  financial crisis in the 1970s &mdash; and another grouping called the Financial Control
  Board. They have the real authority over the money.</p>

  <h4>The power of the unelected</h4>

  <p>The first questions that should occur to anyone concerned with the issue are: Who
  are these people who exercise so much authority? Where do they get it?</p>

  <p>They are bankers, their assistants and friends. This is the most important point to
  remember. None of them is an elected official. It is a case where the elected officials
  abdicate their political authority and shift it over to what amounts to a financial
  oligarchy.</p>

  <p>This oligarchy has really and truly been the political power in New York City.</p>

  <p>But to get back to the $200 million. All this time it was held, securely stashed
  away for a rainy day. Shouldn't that mean it would be dispensed on behalf of the people
  &mdash; the mass of working-class and oppressed people in the city? At least, that's
  the way it was understood.</p>

  <p>Now, suddenly, the money is handed over to the mayor. By whose authority? And for
  what purpose? It really makes an astonishing story.</p>

  <p>This money &mdash; which was saved to help the city, meaning the masses of people,
  in cases of real need &mdash; is going to be used, the mayor explains, to cut jobs and
  lay off city workers.</p>

  <p>According to the Times, Giuliani will use the $200 million not to improve city
  services or help the needy. He'll use it to finance a complex plan to cut jobs using
  severance pay, early retirement and layoffs.</p>

  <p>But this is not what the money was saved for. It was saved to improve the conditions
  of the people of New York. Where are all those constitutional lawyers who know that
  this money is being diverted from its original purpose through an abuse of power?</p>

  <p>Where are all the civic organizations, the so-called watchdogs over the treasury,
  that usually float to the top whenever money is to be allocated for the working people,
  the poor and the unemployed? Not a word from any of them.</p>

  <p>It would seem that a Republican mayor &mdash; a minority figure in this huge,
  overwhelmingly Democratic city &mdash; would be afraid of embarking on such a blatantly
  anti-working-class, really anti-people program. So where is the cacophony of discordant
  voices? It always surfaces whenever something progressive is brought up in the interest
  of the masses. But in this case, there is only dead silence.</p>

  <h4>Robbery is the only word for it</h4>

  <p>All this is, in our opinion, clearly understood by the labor leadership in the city
  and by the Black and Latino caucus leaders in the city council. There is no mystery
  about it. What the mayor has embarked on is clearly a case of unarmed robbery.</p>

  <p>If someone had broken into the vaults and absconded with the money, it would be
  understood as a robbery. This is the same thing &mdash; except that the robbers are
  unarmed and the vault has been opened, graciously, by the new mayor with the unanimous
  backing of Wall Street and the leading capitalist politicians of both parties.</p>

  <p>It should be said that the Democratic politicians are in a way opposed to Giuliani's
  program. But they show no inclination to fight. And by their silence they are in
  reality consenting to it.</p>

  <p>They have done nothing to mobilize the people. They have done nothing to really take
  advantage of the airwaves or the capitalist press. They could make themselves felt, if
  only they would say something meaningful and propose a program of action to combat this
  outright pillaging, plundering of millions of dollars to finance "retirements" and
  layoffs of unwilling workers. Instead, they haven't so much as inquired whether anyone
  wants to be retired or laid off.</p>

  <p>New York City is not only the greatest financial center in the world. It is not only
  the premier commercial center. It is also the site of hundreds of thousands of
  businesses that, although small, are nevertheless significant enough that the city
  attracts capital from all over the world.</p>

  <p>Unlike the 1970s, there is no financial crisis in New York. There is no need to run
  to Washington for a bailout as the leading bankers did in the 1970s. So what has really
  happened?</p>

  <p>A group of the most predatory bankers and industrialists now has full control,
  compared to their limited control in earlier years. And they're running hog wild in
  breaking up the progressive legislation and social improvements that took years to
  build up.</p>

  <p>The situation cries out for the working class and the oppressed masses &mdash; who
  stand to lose the most in the Giuliani-banker conspiracy &mdash; to stand up on their
  two feet and mobilize. The masses alone can stop the Giuliani-banker wrecking crew.</p>
