  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Reform and revolution (Feb. 17, 1994)</title>

  <h1>Reform and revolution</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Feb. 17, 1994)</h5>

  <p>What has made the Cuban Revolution unique? Why is it such a beacon to the workers
  and oppressed masses, not only of Latin America and the Caribbean but around the
  world?</p>

  <p>There have been many uprisings, guerrilla wars, progressive electoral victories and
  military coups in Latin America in the course of this century. But the triumph of Fidel
  Castro's guerrilla army over the Batista dictatorship did something that no previous
  struggle had accomplished.</p>

  <p>It broke up the old state apparatus. The revolution did not merely change governing
  groups, as had happened so many times before. It unseated the bourgeoisie itself from
  its role as the ruling class by demolishing its instrument of rule, the bourgeois
  state.</p>

  <p>It once again proved the monumental words of Karl Marx on the Paris Commune: that
  one of the fundamental characteristics of a change of class structures is the crushing
  of the old state apparatus and its replacement by a new state based on the popular
  consent of the masses.</p>

  <p>This is what happened in Paris in 1871, when popular revolutionary committees took
  over the functions of government. Such committees of the urban masses had first
  appeared in the French Revolution of 1789, when the bourgeoisie had to call out the
  workers and artisans to be able to completely uproot the old feudal order. In 1871, the
  popular committees or communes appeared again, but this time they represented the
  revolutionary struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>In Cuba, the Committees in Defense of the Revolution became the eyes and ears of the
  new class power and its most important line of defense against U.S. imperialist
  sabotage and invasion. The bourgeoisie especially scorned and maligned the CDRs because
  they were the living proof that a new type of state, based on the workers, had taken
  over in Cuba in 1959.</p>

  <h4>Political revolution in Mexico</h4>

  <p>It is instructive to compare this to the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1917 which, for
  all its great achievements, did not go beyond progressive, bourgeois democratic
  reforms. It did, of course, expropriate the big land owners and distribute much of the
  land. This is a great revolutionary measure in the struggle against the big land
  holders, both feudal and capitalist. But it is not a socialist measure.</p>

  <p>The history of peasant rebellions in both Europe and Latin America demonstrates that
  they ultimately deteriorate. The landlords eventually lay their hands again on the best
  and most fertile areas, and the struggle continues until another round of revolutionary
  peasant uprisings.</p>

  <p>Peasant uprisings alone, even if they have some working-class support, do not
  abolish the basis of landlord and capitalist exploitation.</p>

  <p>The Mexican Revolution was a political revolution that reformed the state. This
  explains why Mexico today, despite all its historically important great reforms, is a
  bourgeois country. Different groupings may hold the governing positions, even at the
  summits of power, but this does not change the class structure of society.</p>

  <p>The imperialists themselves recognize that such reforms do not alter the character
  of their exploitation. They have cynically described their relations with Mexico in its
  revolutionary period as "continuing to do business during alterations." Even when
  Mexico nationalized the lands of the foreign oil companies in the 1930s, its
  relationship with the U.S. continued more or less as before.</p>

  <h4>Why Cuban Revolution went further</h4>

  <p>The Cuban Revolution came more than 40 years after the Mexican Revolution. It came
  after the great October socialist revolution in Russia and the revolutions in China,
  Vietnam and Korea. The industrial development of Cuba was greatly advanced compared to
  some other areas of Latin America, despite the constraints imposed by imperialist
  control and ownership &mdash; and the poverty and underdevelopment of much of the
  countryside.</p>

  <p>While Cuba had not reached the level of the European capitalist states, the
  objective basis for socialist revolution had matured there. It must always be
  remembered that Cuba lives in the shadow of U.S. finance capital, which until the
  revolution controlled its most important economic arteries.</p>

  <p>Liberal writers in the U.S., some of them very well-meaning, spread confusion about
  the socialist revolution in Cuba. Some of it was actuated by friendly desires not to
  cast Cuba in communist revolutionary colors, for fear of giving aid to imperialism.</p>

  <p>Projecting a moderate image of Cuba seemed necessary in order to withstand the
  utterly unprecedented vileness of the imperialist press and the increasingly shrill
  calls by the most extreme elements for intervention. It continued even in the face of a
  possible nuclear confrontation between the U.S. and Cuba over the latter's alliance
  with the USSR.</p>

  <p>Many liberal and socialist elements in the U.S. closely studied the Cuban
  Revolution. Probably the best account was by Leo Huberman and Paul Sweezy in the book
  <em>Cuba: Anatomy of a Revolution</em> (Monthly Review Press, 1960). While the Cuban
  leaders at that time spoke of the revolution only in terms of specific reforms,
  Huberman and Sweezy had "no hesitation" in concluding that "the new Cuba is a socialist
  Cuba."</p>

  <p>In the United States, the discussion of the class character of the Cuban Revolution
  came to a rather abrupt end when Comrade Fidel Castro, in a speech made just as CIA
  planes were bombing Cuba during the April 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, for the first time
  put it quite explicitly: "What the Yankee imperialists will not forgive is that we have
  made a socialist revolution right under their very noses."</p>

  <h4>Strong unions and Communist Party</h4>

  <p>It's important to note that before the rise of the 26th of July Movement that
  launched the revolutionary struggle for power, Cuba had for many years had a strong
  Communist Party and trade unions that survived years of repression. The early liberal
  and progressive literature in the United States about the Cuban Revolution often
  overlooked this. But objective and subjective conditions in Cuba had matured to the
  point where a strong Communist Party was possible.</p>

  <p>Mexico in 1910 did not have the conditions for the existence of a revolutionary
  working-class party. There were no communist parties yet in existence anywhere. Nor
  were conditions ripe for such a party. The party that came out of the Mexican
  Revolution was the Institutional Revolutionary Party, a bourgeois party that has ruled
  until the present day.</p>

  <h4>Isolation of socialist states</h4>

  <p>After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the first workers' state faced imperialist
  intervention, civil war and isolation. One basic reason it was able to overcome all
  this, even after the failure of revolutions in Europe, was the enormous size of the
  country.</p>

  <p>The Chinese revolution was less isolated because of the existence of the USSR.
  Nevertheless, no sooner had the Chinese Communists marched into Beijing in 1949 than
  the U.S. imperialists opened an attack right next door in Korea.</p>

  <p>The French, meanwhile, opened an offensive in their former colony of Vietnam. And
  the British were fighting an insurgent movement in Malaya. For many years, it seemed as
  though China would be the target of an open imperialist war in Asia led by the U.S.</p>

  <p>Until 1971, the U.S. and its imperialist allies on the United Nations Security
  Council prevented People's China from taking its rightful seat in the UN, and blocked
  diplomatic recognition of China by other capitalist countries.</p>

  <p>So when the Cuban Revolution began to break the bonds of imperialism, the U.S.
  quickly moved to isolate this island of 10 million people. Washington thought the
  revolutionary government would not long survive an economic blockade coupled with
  military intervention.</p>

  <p>It is an incontestable fact that without the very significant material, political
  and diplomatic support extended to Cuba by the Soviet Union, Cuba's position at that
  time would have been almost impossible. It took a nuclear confrontation to bring the
  U.S. military colossus to a rational temporary standoff in its struggle to overthrow
  the Cuban socialist government. The hearts and minds of the bulk of humanity during the
  entire course of the missile crisis were almost wholly on the side of Cuba and the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the further exigencies of the relationship, that historic experience
  is not likely to be forgotten, either in the camp of Cuba's friends or of its foes.</p>

  <h4>Attempts to isolate Cuba fail</h4>

  <p>The fact that the U.S. attempt to isolate Cuba has failed was confirmed once again
  in November when the UN General Assembly voted 88 to four for an end to the embargo.
  The three countries that voted with the U.S. were Paraguay, Israel and Albania. The
  U.S. imperialists could not even get one of their own imperialist allies on board, nor
  one country of any size.</p>

  <p>Despite the attempts at isolation, Cuba is a most cosmopolitan place. It is
  constantly hosting international conferences and exhibits on science, technology and
  the arts. It has contacts with all the progressive movements in Latin America and the
  Caribbean, ranging across a broad political spectrum. All over the world, Cuba retains
  its diplomatic and political standing.</p>

  <p>When President Fidel Castro travels anywhere in Latin America, the populace turns
  out to greet him.</p>

  <p>Cuba is being hurt economically because of the vast array of U.S. forces against it.
  But it cannot be isolated politically.</p>

  <h4>Breaking the ice here</h4>

  <p>Finally, resistance to imperialism's war against Cuba is rising inside the U.S. as
  never before. The old hate campaigns against Cuba are disintegrating, from Miami to New
  York to San Francisco.</p>

  <p>The ice was first broken in January 1992, when a rally for Cuba in New York's
  spacious Jacob Javits Convention Center was filled to overflowing. The splendid turnout
  made a mockery of counter-revolutionary Cubans' threats to disrupt the rally.</p>

  <p>Another Peace for Cuba rally, set to take place in New York Feb. 12, is already sold
  out. Plans are being made for a second rally for the overflow crowd. What does that
  show but that the ice is cracking?</p>

  <p>As we said on an earlier occasion, the need of the hour is not only to challenge the
  U.S. blockade but to change the political climate in this country toward Cuba. Now we
  are beginning to see the results of just such a campaign.</p>

  <p>Despite the 30-year U.S. effort to isolate Cuba diplomatically, economically and
  politically, the Cuban Revolution stands tall as an unconquerable fortress of the world
  revolution. And no force on the face of the earth will overturn it.</p>
