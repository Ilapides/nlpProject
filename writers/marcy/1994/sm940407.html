  <h1>The nature of Clinton's crisis</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 7, 1994)</h5>

  <p>What is the nature of Clinton's crisis?</p>

  <p>It has been well said that every serious political struggle is also a class
  struggle. Can this be said about the Clinton administration's struggle to survive?</p>

  <p>What is striking about the so-called Whitewater tug-of-war is the absence of a
  vigorous and open independent intervention of the working class, the trade unions, the
  civil rights movement &mdash; all the progressive political forces. That is inherent in
  the situation, especially regarding the issue that summarizes all the others &mdash;
  health care. The absence of any open working-class intervention conceals the class
  strife beneath the surface.</p>

  <p>How weak the support is for Clinton from the more progressive liberal forces. Only
  now [March 29] have they managed to put out a full-page advertisement in the New York
  Times in support of the Clintons.</p>

  <h4>From Guinier to Whitewater</h4>

  <p>The entire course of Clinton's tenure in office &mdash; true, it hasn't been very
  long &mdash; has been distinguished by one capitulation after another to an assortment
  of right-wing opposition groupings.</p>

  <p>What made this more clear than ever was his surrender to the Republican opposition
  in the Lani Guinier case. He was about to appoint her to a position in the Justice
  Department. It appeared to be nothing more than an ordinary, garden-variety sort of
  appointment, one of many by the president.</p>

  <p>It was not a situation in which he had to array his administration to fight off a
  very serious Republican challenge. It was in reality a small thing, as these matters
  go. But the Republican right caught on immediately that he was weak and wavering.</p>

  <p>It began to push against the nomination. It would not have taken much on his part to
  have succeeded, since both houses of Congress have a majority of Democrats. But
  suddenly, Clinton pulled back, folded his tent and gave up.</p>

  <p>His term in office since then has been one capitulation after another, allowing his
  Republican opposition to win battles with numerically inferior forces. Most telling is
  that on issues of foreign policy and imperialist militarism, he has completely
  abdicated to the State Department and the Pentagon.</p>

  <p>Notice the smooth way the Pentagon put over General John Shalikashvili as Chairman
  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Clinton appeared uninvolved in the decision. It was as
  though Shalikashvili was some minor official appointed to a low-level position.</p>

  <p>It is a most serious defect in any head of a capitalist state not to be able to
  defend his own most important appointments. Putting aside the Guinier case for the
  moment, it is necessary to focus on the most recent and indeed most serious development
  in the growing crisis of Clinton's presidency.</p>

  <h4>Clinton and Stephanopoulos</h4>

  <p>It is well known that George Stephanopoulos is not only Clinton's most important and
  intimate assistant but also has a reputation of being capable and aggressive in
  Clinton' defense. Indeed, when one considers the number of Clinton's associates who
  have defected to the other side, Stephanopoulos stands out as the most stalwart and
  capable defender of the administration.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when the opposition subpoenaed him to appear at a hearing, whatever it
  concerned, it was high time for Clinton to stand up and say no. He clearly could have
  done this by denouncing it as a Republican trick to dismantle his presidency. Now
  Stephanopoulos' time will be taken up with preparing his defense &mdash; which could
  last virtually until the Clinton presidency is over, if the Republicans have their
  way.</p>

  <p>What's involved is not merely concern over Stephanopoulos as a principal assistant
  to the president. It rotates around the effort to completely isolate Clinton, to make
  him more and more dependent on the very conservative elements in his administration,
  allowing the conservative right-wing of the Democratic Party and the Republicans from
  the outside to influence policy.</p>

  <p>The purpose is to make Clinton's exit easier so the Republicans can make a
  comeback.</p>

  <p>The significance of advisers to the president has its antecedents deep in English
  history. Unlike in France, where the revolution cut down feudalism and the monarchy to
  boot, in England the monarchy survived. Having advisers to the crown was one of the
  most significant ways in which the bourgeoisie ultimately took over the state from the
  feudal lords and transformed the monarchy into a bourgeois institution.</p>

  <p>It is not unimportant in present-day capitalist governments to analyze how a
  president or prime minister deals with the question of advisers or cabinet members.
  It's a critical political issue to which the bourgeoisie never closes its eyes.</p>

  <h4>Not one of their very own</h4>

  <p>Why is the right-wing opposition going through such trouble to get rid of Clinton
  when he has been so compliant to their demands?</p>

  <p>Nothing pleases the ruling class as much as having their very own to not only
  manipulate the political process but completely control it. In the long run, it all
  adds up to enormously more profitable business ventures for them than would otherwise
  be the case.</p>

  <p>The politics of the bourgeoisie is big business. It is an aspect of capitalist
  development in the U.S. that a working-class party must take great pains to explain
  clearly to the workers.</p>

  <p>Progressive social legislation over the years has been hard won. All too frequently
  these gains are attributed to either the glorious merits of the bourgeois democratic
  system or to individual leaders in the capitalist state &mdash; the most illustrious
  being Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>

  <p>Yet that is not how they were won. The workers fought for an eight-hour day for
  decades before the capitalist politicians would raise it as an issue, and it took
  longer yet for it to become a reality.</p>

  <p>It would be a fortunate course of action if the labor movement and especially the
  Black and Latino movements utilized this period politically &mdash; a period when the
  capitalist administration is in disarray &mdash; to improve their own situation at the
  expense of the exploiting and oppressing class. To do so they must combat the tendency
  to "feel sorry" for Clinton, who, in Karl Marx's words, is the chairman of the
  executive committee of the ruling class, not of the oppressed class.</p>

  <p>What a great turn of events it would be if all the workers &mdash; Black, Latino,
  Native, Asian and white, gay, lesbian and straight &mdash; were to embark united on
  such a course rather than trod the beaten path.</p>

  <p>Everything depends on being able to see the Clinton crisis in terms of class
  relations, rather than viewing it in the political images presented by the capitalist
  press and media.</p>

  <h4>Beyond the corruption issue</h4>

  <p>Ordinarily, the socialist attitude toward the endemic struggles over graft and
  corruption in capitalist administrations is not to pay undue attention to them.
  Fighting corruption in the government and state apparatus is as old as capitalist
  relations. The Marxist movement rightly has devoted its attention to conducting an
  independent struggle of the working class against all forms of capitalist oppression
  and exploitation, whether these are committed by "private" interests or by the
  capitalist state.</p>

  <p>However, it is important to be very much on guard. Inherent in the present situation
  is the danger that, under cover of conducting a struggle against graft and corruption,
  a surreptitious effort may be made to change the very structure and form of the
  capitalist state in the United States.</p>

  <p>The basis for the development of such an eventuality lies not in capriciousness,
  chicanery or the ability to manipulate various political factions by the ruling class.
  Rather, it comes from the inherent instability of capitalist relations, not only in the
  United States but in the world system of capitalism in the present period.</p>

  <p>It is from this vantage point that we have to examine the current struggle of the
  Clinton administration. Otherwise, it would not be worth our attention.</p>

  <p>Whether or not the struggle against Clinton rotates around Stephanopoulos, it
  nevertheless goes on. It is meant not only to weaken the current president's role in
  the capitalist state but to reallocate the political forces in the capitalist
  government so as to favor the most powerful of them.</p>

  <p>This is most important now compared to earlier administrations because the
  restructuring of capitalist industry is now more dependent on the cooperation of the
  capitalist state than ever before.</p>

  <p>The first and most important historical restructuring of capitalist industry
  occurred during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. But at that time it was the
  president who was most interested in restructuring and modernizing labor relations,
  strengthening the industrial unions in the CIO as against the archaic craft unions.</p>

  <p>Under present conditions, the labor movement has to first of all demonstrate its
  presence in the class struggle and define its relationship to the capitalist
  government, rather than dance around it so one can hardly make out whether it is
  cooperating with the administration or resisting it.</p>
