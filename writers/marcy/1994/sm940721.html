  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Kim Il Sung (July 21, 1994)</title>

  <h1>Kim Il Sung</h1>

  <h2>Anti-imperialist fighter, socialist hero</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (July 21, 1994)</h5>

  <p><em>On July 9, Workers World Party Chairperson Sam Marcy sent the following
  statement to Comrade Kim Jong Il, the Central Committee of the Workers Party of Korea
  and the State Funeral Committee of President Kim Il Sung.</em></p>

  <p>Dear Comrade Kim Jong Il:</p>

  <p>The National Committee of Workers World Party extends our deepest condolences on the
  passing of the great leader of the Korean people, Comrade President Kim Il Sung.</p>

  <p>Comrade Kim Il Sung devoted his whole life to the Korean people's struggle for
  national self-determination and the international working-class struggle for socialist
  emancipation. With his leadership, the Korean people defeated the Japanese colonial
  occupation and soon after brought about the first defeat of the U.S. imperialist
  military machine.</p>

  <p>For over 40 years since the armistice, the U.S. military has continued to occupy the
  south of Korea with troops and nuclear weapons. This occupation has been the chief
  obstacle to peaceful reunification of Korea and poses the chief danger of a new war on
  the peninsula.</p>

  <p>The recent nuclear crisis is the latest episode in a long history of Pentagon
  threats and provocation against Korea. At a time when the people of the United States
  are suffering from unemployment, racism and a general decline in living standards,
  another U.S. war against Korea would be a terrible crime against the poor and working
  people of the U.S. as well as against the people of Korea.</p>

  <p>Comrade Kim Il Sung worked tirelessly to bring about the peaceful reunification of
  Korea and to forge a lasting peace on the peninsula. Workers World Party, representing
  class-conscious workers in the U.S., understands that Comrade Kim Il Sung's great
  efforts to achieve peace and reunification met the aspirations of the Korean people and
  also benefited the poor and working people of the U.S.</p>

  <p>It is Kim Il Sung's remarkable achievement that in his own lifetime he became a
  symbol of national liberation and reunification for the Korean people, and a symbol of
  the anti-imperialist and socialist struggles of all the world's peoples. Although U.S.
  imperialism tried at every opportunity to blockade, threaten and sabotage the
  construction of socialism in the north, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
  stands strong. The accomplishments of socialist construction will be a lasting monument
  to the leadership of Comrade Kim Il Sung.</p>

  <p>International developments in the last few years have created great difficulties for
  the working class and oppressed peoples of the world. And in the face of these
  difficulties some have wavered or even abandoned the struggle. But Comrade Kim Il Sung
  and the Workers Party of Korea refused to let go of the principles of revolutionary
  socialist internationalism.</p>

  <p>Leadership in times of great difficulties is what makes a leader truly great.</p>

  <p>Workers World Party values our close, comradely relations with the Workers Party of
  Korea very highly. We are proud to have known Kim Il Sung as a great leader and a
  comrade in the international communist movement. And it is with the most profound sense
  of loss that we mark his passing. Yet it is also with the greatest revolutionary
  optimism that we are confident that Comrade Kim Il Sung's legacy will live on with your
  efforts to win new victories for the Korean people. His contributions and achievements
  for the cause of international socialism for all humanity will never be forgotten.</p>

  <p>With comradely solidarity, Sam Marcy Chairperson, Workers World Party</p>
