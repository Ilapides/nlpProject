  <h1>Nixon's Visits to Moscow and Peking</h1>

  <h4>October 18, 1971</h4>

  <p>Nixon will visit Moscow next spring, after his trip to the People's Republic of
  China. To political partisans of the Soviet leadership, like the Daily World in this
  country, this trip is a "breakthrough for peace" and "an important breach in the
  aggressive structure built up by U.S. imperialism." (The Daily World, by the way, was
  not so wildly enthusiastic about Nixon's trip to China.) Other left tendencies see
  Nixon's projected visit to China in a similar light: as a victory for China and the
  oppressed.</p>

  <p>Workers World Party has always supported the socialist countries against imperialist
  attempts to undermine and destroy them in the irreconcilable antagonism between the two
  social systems, we stand unconditionally with our class, the proletariat, defending the
  workers' states regardless of the politics of the leadership.</p>

  <p>The history of the world since 1917 is replete with proofs that Western
  imperialism's basic objective is to destroy the socialist countries. Their strategy
  since the formation of the Chinese People's Republic has been to try and drive a wedge
  between the two great socialist powers.</p>

  <p>It is in this light that we view Nixon's forthcoming visits to both China and the
  Soviet Union. Nixon, taking advantage of the split between the two great socialist
  powers, is blackmailing both the Soviet Union and China with the prospect that the U.S.
  may enter into an alliance with one against the other. Even the timing of these two
  trips is arranged with that end in mind.</p>

  <p>Those who claim that Nixon's trip to Peking (or Moscow) is a good thing for the
  workers and oppressed of the world say that imperialism is forced to sue for peace
  because it has been so greatly weakened by its failure to subdue the Vietnamese. It is
  absolutely true that imperialism's failures in Southeast Asia have brought on both a
  political and economic crisis for the monopolists. But is Nixon opening up a diplomatic
  offensive with the Soviet Union and China in order to sue for peace, which he could do
  at Paris, or to recoup U.S. losses and reorganize for a new and (he hopes) more
  successful aggression?</p>

  <p>Let us look at the realities. The U.S. has not withdrawn from Southeast Asia. On the
  contrary, it still maintains over 200,000 combat troops in Vietnam, and recent Pentagon
  disclosures show that plans are already laid out for military campaigns in Cambodia
  through 1977! For Nixon to be invited to come to the capitals of either socialist ally
  while there are daily bombings cannot be encouraging to the Vietnamese liberation
  fighters.</p>

  <p>In addition, the U.S. continues to bolster its position in the strategic Middle
  East, sending more Phantom jets to Israel, lending all its authority to the most
  tyrannical puppets like the Shah and King Hussein, and shoring up the NATO southern
  flank by promoting the Greek fascists while sending the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to
  Spain to integrate another fascist state into its European military alliance.</p>

  <p>On the general military front, Laird in a Pentagon press briefing has voiced dire
  warnings about the Soviet Union's missile system capabilities, laying the groundwork
  for another escalation of the arms budget. The Pentagon is also demanding more billions
  to expand the Navy, citing the growth of the Soviet fleet as a pretext.</p>

  <p>The point is that imperialism has not changed its basic nature, nor has it resigned
  itself to the existence and development of socialism in the world. U.S. diplomatic
  strategy, like all aspects of their foreign policy, is calculated to find a breathing
  spell at the bargaining table while they make preparations to renew the expansion on
  which the health of their system depends.</p>

  <p>We have no argument with those who say that the socialist countries must try and
  normalize relations with the capitalist nations. But it is false to imply that the only
  way in which diplomatic state relations can be normalized is by inviting Nixon to the
  capitals of the socialist world to engage the most hated imperialist leader in secret
  discussions. The larger issue is whether Nixon's visits will serve the interests of
  developing socialism in China and the Soviet Union, as well as the international
  struggle of the working class. We think it would be better if he stayed here. And it
  would be 100 times better if we were able to sharpen the growing revolutionary struggle
  here and make it impossible for him to leave.</p>
