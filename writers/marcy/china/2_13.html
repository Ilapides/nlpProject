  <h1>Mao Didn't Wait for Thermidor</h1>

  <h4>March 3, 1967</h4><em>By SAM MARCY</em>

  <p>Even if the cultural revolution should falter and temporarily come to a halt as a
  result of considerable resistance from the revisionist and rightist forces, it would
  still be a significant historical achievement.</p>

  <p>For it is the first time, since the early days of the Great October Socialist
  Revolution, that the leadership of a socialist country picked up the threads of the
  Paris Commune and made an earnest effort not only to crush the old state machine, but
  to do away altogether with those elements of the bureaucratic apparatus of the old
  order. These are the elements which every socialist state to one extent or another has
  inherited from the past and in the course of trying to reconstruct society on a new
  basis, found necessary to utilize for immediate practical purposes. But as time passed,
  such societies were either unwilling or unable to cast them off. China's effort is all
  the more remarkable because of the tremendous struggle launched to carry this out by
  projecting the masses on to the political arena and attempting to awaken their creative
  initiative in completing the revolution.</p>

  <p>In none of the socialist countries has there taken place that kind of clean sweep of
  what Marx called "the old rubbish." And wherever efforts were made to get rid of them,
  in the end, they cropped up again. By their nature and social make-up they act as the
  breeder and carrier of the reactionary leftovers of the old order.</p>

  <p>It is in this light that the mighty social and political upheaval known as the
  cultural revolution should be viewed.</p>

  <p>For what Mao Tse-tung and his collaborators are trying to do is nothing less that to
  make a truly heroic and herculean effort to avoid the advance of Thermidor on the soil
  of the Chinese Revolution.</p>

  <p>Every great revolution in world history has up until now had its period of
  tempestuous surge forward which was followed by a decline and included a partial
  reaction. This was so in The Russian Revolution, The French Revolution, as well as The
  Cromwellian Revolution in 17th Century England. In each of these cases, there was a
  partial reaction in which reactionary groupings took over, but in none of these cases
  was there ever a restoration to the full previous status quo.</p>

  <p>The French Revolution had its Thermidorian period of reaction which came on the
  heels of the Jacobin period. But feudalism was destroyed root and branch, and the
  Thermidorian period was a political reaction with limited regressive social and
  economic consequences. (It takes its name from the month of "thermidor" on the French
  Revolution's new calendar, the month during which Robespierre was killed by the
  reactionaries.) The old feudal system, as a social system, was destroyed and the new
  bourgeois system began to flourish. About the same happened with the earlier
  Cromwellian revolution, except that more substantial concessions were made to the old
  ruling class.</p>

  <p>Whatever one may consider the starting point of Thermidor in the Soviet Union
  &mdash; whether it was under Stalin or Khrushchev &mdash; all revolutionary groups are
  agreed that a period of reaction ensued which is now in full bloom But the difference
  between Thermidor on the social foundation (class foundation) of a proletarian
  revolution and the bourgeois revolution may turn out to be of a very fundamental
  character.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois system of production, which is based upon market relations and
  exploitation of wage labor by capital, can grow and develop spontaneously under a
  monarchy, under a Bonapartist dictatorship (even of the most reactionary totalitarian
  character), as well as under a relatively stable bourgeois democracy. In spite of the
  anarchy inherent in capitalist production, the capitalist system develops automatically
  &mdash; spontaneously, because of the market, and the political superstructure merely
  acts as an accelerator or a brake on its development, as the case may be. This is no
  small matter of concerts of course! But history has shown no instance whatsoever where
  a capitalist order of society was restored to the old feudal system.</p>

  <p>It may be otherwise with the newly established dictatorship of the proletariat,
  which has taken possession of the basic means of production. Once it has taken over the
  basic means of production it can scarcely develop at all except on the basis of
  conscious centralized planning The social relationships can neither be stabilized nor
  developed, either in the economic or the political sphere, without conscious planning.
  That is a basic difference between the bourgeois revolution and the proletarian
  revolution.</p>

  <p>If a reaction takes place in a socialist &mdash; i.e., workers' state, that is, if a
  Thermidorian reaction occurs on the foundation of a proletarian dictatorship, it is
  immensely more dangerous than in a bourgeois revolution. Thermidor in the French
  Revolution went as far as it could but the new bourgeois relations developed, the
  productive forces developed, commerce and industry flourished, the exploitation of the
  workers was accelerated, the productivity of labor heightened and science and industry
  began to make giant steps forward.</p>

  <p>Thermidor on the basis of a socialist state (i.e. a workers' state) especially if
  the reaction sinks deeper and deeper roots, has the possibility of fully dissolving all
  the newly established economic relationships, newly established by the proletarian
  dictatorship, unless it is stopped. While a full scale bourgeois restoration is a
  theoretical possibility, it is exceedingly improbable. However, only life will prove
  which will prevail.</p>

  <p>Scarcely a day passes without there being some news of a further development of the
  so-called economic liberalization and decentralization methods in the Soviet Union and
  Eastern Europe. Most ominous is the rapid development of the so called new profit
  system for various establishments and the further extension of individual material
  incentives which undermine the class solidarity not only of the working people but the
  general population.</p>

  <p>The continuing widening of the gulf between the privileges of the new social stratum
  and the general mass of the population is becoming so great and the method of material
  incentive so extensive that they pose the greatest danger to the public &mdash;
  socialized &mdash; ownership of the means of production. The Soviet leadership must
  bear full responsibility for the threatening danger to the social achievements of the
  October Revolution. It is their political and economic policies which continue and
  constantly enlarge this danger.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly Mao saw the development of Thermidor in the Soviet Union and its
  debilitating effects both in the economic field as well as in the arena of political
  life in general. Ail the more remarkable is the effort made to stop the engulfing
  Thermidorian advance which has enveloped the bulk of the socialist countries. The
  lasting significance of the cultural revolution will not be in how far and deep it will
  eventually advance but in that it organized a tremendous army, which in effect made its
  watchword to the Thermidor:</p>

  <p>"Thus far they've gone and no farther. They shall not pass!"</p>
