  <h5>China and the Class War 1959-1972 [Sam Marcy]</h5>

  <h1>On the 25 Points of the Chinese CP</h1>

  <h4>July 12, 1963</h4>

  <p>The June 14 letter of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the
  Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a remarkably lucid and
  clear exposition of the fundamental tenets of contemporary revolutionary
  Marxism-Leninism. No one who has carefully read it can fail to be impressed with it.
  Basically, it is a defense against revisionist distortions and opportunist adaptations
  by Khrushchev and his collaborators.</p>

  <p>As for us, we wholeheartedly support and endorse it. It raises and answers the
  fundamental question, "Whether or not to accept the fact that the people already on the
  socialist road, who comprise one third of the world's population, need to carry their
  revolution forward to the end."</p>

  <p>This is precisely the question that divided Lenin and the Bolsheviks from Kautsky
  and the Social Democratic reformists, who subsequently became renegades and outright
  enemies of the proletarian revolution.</p>

  <p>The letter of the Chinese CP mercilessly castigates those who would "one-sidedly
  reduce peaceful co-existence, peaceful competition and peaceful transition" in a way
  which would "discard the historical mission of proletarian world revolution and depart
  from the revolutionary teachings of Marxism-Leninism."</p>

  <p>Of special interest to the American workers is the passage which declares that "It
  is impassible for the working class in the European and American capitalist countries
  to liberate itself unless it unites with the oppressed nations and unless those
  oppressed nations are liberated."</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the letter points out that, "Certain persons in the international
  Communist movement are now taking a passive or scornful or negative attitude toward the
  struggle of the oppressed nations for liberation."</p>

  <p>Moreover, the letter says, "They are, in fact, protecting the interests of monopoly
  capital, betraying those of the proletariat, and degenerating into social
  democrats."</p>

  <p>For reasons best known to themselves, the Soviet leadership did not see fit to print
  the letter of the Chinese CP in the USSR and thereby deprived the people of the USSR
  the opportunity to read this letter and judge for themselves. Meantime, the Chinese
  have printed all of the important communications from the Soviet CP.</p>

  <p>When staff members of the Chinese Embassy in Moscow, in the normal course of their
  diplomatic duties, made the letter available, the Soviet government took the rash and
  absolutely unwarranted step of demanding that they be recalled to China and thereby
  dealt a blow to the socialist relationship between the USSR and the People's Republic
  of China.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the imperialists and their lackeys the world over are gloating over this
  and doing their best to deepen the growing schism in the international Communist
  movement and between the socialist countries. In this connection, it must be noted that
  the leadership of the Chinese CP has conducted itself during all this period with calm
  dignity and enormous restraint in the face of provocations.</p>

  <p>Indeed, in making the decision to send a delegation to Moscow after the Soviet
  leadership had rudely and without any just cause demanded the withdrawal of the five
  Chinese Embassy officials, the Chinese CP leadership demonstrated that it stood for the
  unity of the international communist movement and would not permit such a provocation
  as that perpetrated by the leaders of the USSR to prevent a discussion as long as any
  avenues remained open for it.</p>
