  <h5>China and the Class War 1959-1972 [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Who are the "Ultra-Lefts," Khrushchev?</h1>

  <h4>July 1, 1960</h4>

  <p>The imperialist press the world over was all but delirious over the recent Pravda
  article denouncing "left sectarianism." And with good reason! For they knew all too
  well that the long-awaited attack was directed not against real living sectarians or
  ultra-lefts, but against none other than the firmest, and strongest class ally of the
  Soviet Union &mdash; Communist China and the Chinese CP.</p>

  <p>With malicious delight, the New York Times of June 14, 1960, exclaimed that
  Khrushchev would eventually have to come out against Peking in much less guarded terms.
  Loyal Communists throughout the world, genuine Socialists, and friends of the Soviet
  Union generally, have a natural reluctance to accept the imperialist interpretation of
  events. And that is the way it should be.</p>

  <p>But the <em>deeds</em> of the imperialists which speak a thousand times louder than
  all the imperialist propaganda, must be examined carefully and clearly by all
  class-conscious workers and Communists.</p>

  <p>Just consider this: Barely had four weeks elapsed since the collapse of the Summit
  Conference and the U.S. ruling class quickly began to readjust its strategy toward the
  Communist bloc. In doing so, it once again demonstrated that its class instinct for
  blackmail and bribery is as sharp as its appetite for imperialist plunder is
  insatiable.</p>

  <p>In the case of Poland, for instance, the U.S. announced that it will negotiate a
  credit in the sum of no less than $100 million for surplus food, and in return will
  merely take "local currency." A rather generous offer, indeed!</p>

  <p>This offer followed immediately upon the heels of a speech by the Polish Ambassador
  to the UN, Jerzy Michalowski, on May 24,1960. The speech was made during the U-2
  debate. Michalowski, while he supported and voted for the Soviet resolution, made it
  clear that his line of attack was based principally and primarily on "violation of
  international law and sovereignty" &mdash; and pointedly refrained from attacking the
  U.S. as an imperialist aggressor which was the line of the USSR's attack.</p>

  <p>All who had their ears carefully attuned to the measured words of the Polish
  delegate knew what his speech meant. It was a diplomatic signal from Gomulka to
  Eisenhower that the Polish regime still stood at the extreme <em>right</em> of the
  Communist bloc &mdash; with the exception, of course, of Yugoslavia.</p>

  <p>How different it was with the case of China! No imperialist handouts there! But more
  guns, planes, ships and missiles to reinforce the Seventh Fleet and "safeguard" the
  security of the Western Pacific! And that's not all. The hastily convened SEATO
  Conference was quickly shifted to <em>Washington,</em> where both Herter and Nixon
  unloosed the most provocative and bellicose of war speeches directed against China and
  made open threats of continual military maneuvers around the South China Seas. And
  this, on top of more than one hundred violations of China's air space!</p>

  <p>Can Khrushchev fail to realize the significance of the mightiest capitalist
  government handing out generous offers to <em>one</em> of his collaborators and meting
  out punishment and threats of aggression to another? Hardly.</p>

  <p>By scandalizing the Chinese CP to the glee and merriment of the entire imperialist
  bourgeoisie, Khrushchev <em>weakened</em> the USSR and sharpened the appetites of the
  war-makers.</p>

  <p>And the irony of it all is that by doing so, he has done damage to his own theses of
  "peaceful co-existence." For if there is any validity to his thesis at all (and we
  don't believe there is), one of its firmest pillars is the avowed unity of the entire
  Socialist camp. Yet who among the imperialists will fail to see that Khrushchev's
  attack on the Chinese CP revealed a widening rift within the camp.</p>

  <p>The bribery offered to Poland and the blackmail attempt on China are in the final
  analysis only <em>two different forms of pressure exerted on the USSR, itself.</em> One
  only has to ponder for a moment the enormous harm to the defense position of the USSR
  and the international proletariat if U.S. imperialism's tactic toward Poland and China
  were to succeed even only partially!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the same acute contradictions of imperialism which perpetually pull it
  in the direction of war against the Soviet bloc also exhibit a tendency in the opposite
  direction. The revolutionary intervention of the masses in Japan, the overthrow of the
  Syngman Rhee government in Korea, and the ouster of Menderes in Turkey operate, even if
  only temporarily, as a <em>tremendous brake on the Pentagon militarists</em> and
  constantly upset their war plans.</p>

  <p>This has saved the Soviet bloc from the catastrophe that Khrushchev is courting with
  his false policy of conciliation with imperialism, while China openly defies the U.S.
  war-makers. This is the <em>real</em> issue in the struggle he is waging against the
  Chinese CP, for which "left-sectarianism" has served as a shabby cover.</p>
