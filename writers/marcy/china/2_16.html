  <h1>On the Sino-Soviet Negotiations</h1>

  <h4>November 13, 1969</h4>

  <p>The Sino-Soviet talks that are now in progress in Peking could exercise a profound
  influence on the course of events not only in Asia but throughout the whole world. The
  negotiations in Peking probably figure in the calculations of Washington as the most
  important international factor in relation to its war of aggression against
  Vietnam.</p>

  <p>It should be as clear as crystal that if the Sino-Soviet negotiations end in an
  agreement to "disengage by withdrawing from, or refraining from entering all the
  disputed areas along the border," it would constitute a singular blow against the hopes
  and aspirations of imperialism for war between the two largest socialist countries. It
  would free both China and the Soviet Union not only to concentrate more on peaceful
  socialist construction, to assist other socialist countries in these very same tasks,
  but also to firm up the anti-imperialist front. It need scarcely be added that even the
  most bellicose elements in the Pentagon would have to take notice of this
  development.</p>

  <h4>ONLY THE IMPERIALISTS CAN LOSE</h4>

  <p>Indeed, has not the border war between the Soviet Union and China been a cardinal
  element in the schemes of the monopolist war-makers to expand their war in Southeast
  Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere?</p>

  <p>It would be difficult for a class-conscious worker, let alone a genuine Communist,
  to see anything but a progressive development in a successful conclusion of the
  Sino-Soviet talks on the basis that both the People's Republic of China and the Soviet
  Union would regard as mutually satisfactory.</p>

  <p>Only the imperialists, led by the U.S. can lose by such an agreement.</p>

  <p>All the more interesting is it to read what purports to be an editorial in the
  October 1939 issue of <em>Challenge,</em> organ of the Progressive Labor Party, which
  regards itself as a Marxist-Leninist organization. "They (the Soviet Union) are trying
  to maneuver the Chinese into ill-conceived negotiations, as they have the
  Vietnamese."</p>

  <p>"Furthermore," the editorial rushes to add, "the Soviet Union is a new imperialist
  power. It wants to negotiate with socialist China in order to legitimize its
  imperialist position in the Middle East," and finally concludes that "even if fighting
  continues to flare up, and the Chinese continue to criticize the Soviet bosses &mdash;
  negotiations will eventually lead to accommodation with revisionism. What can the
  revolutionary Chinese discuss with the counter-revolutionary Soviets? Chinese-Soviet
  negotiations would eventually lead to the sacrificing of a revolutionary line and
  revolutionary actions by China."</p>

  <h4>PLP: NO CONFIDENCE IN CCP</h4>

  <p>As anyone can see from the reading of these quotations, the leaders of the
  Progressive Labor Party have no confidence in the revolutionary capacity of the Chinese
  leaders to conduct negotiations with the Soviet leaders except on the basis of the
  Chinese leaders accommodating themselves to revisionism. Even if the Chinese leaders
  continue to criticize the Soviets, that would not satisfy the high standards set by
  PLP. What, after all, can the revolutionary Chinese discuss with the
  counter-revolutionary Soviets? This question is asked by them in all seriousness.</p>

  <p>Assuming, but not conceding, that the Soviet Union is an "imperialist state," is
  "thoroughly counter-revolutionary," etc., etc., what is wrong with conducting talks for
  the purpose of settling a border dispute with an "imperialist" power?</p>

  <p>Had not the People's Republic of China been conducting ambassadorial talks over a
  period of many years in Warsaw with the U.S.? Or isn't the U.S. an imperialist power?
  Or is the virus of revisionism so powerful that mere talks with its representatives
  will result in a capitulation?</p>

  <h4>LENIN ON BREST-LITOVSK</h4>

  <p>It is almost half a century since Lenin wrote <em>Left-Wing Communism,</em> in which
  he explained the necessity of agreements with real imperialist powers, not just a
  revisionist bureaucracy, wherever the demands of the situation make it proper. Thus the
  Brest-Litovsk Treaty with the Germans was made in the interest of saving the revolution
  by dividing the imperialists. It did not result, as the anarchists and ultra-lefts in
  the Soviet Union at that time feared, in an abandonment of revolutionary principles and
  practices. On the contrary, it strengthened the revolution and permitted it to continue
  to struggle against the other imperialists with renewed vigor and revolutionary
  determination.</p>

  <p>After the termination of the war, the Bolsheviks began a whole series of agreements
  with imperialist powers and also resumed contacts and discussions with the leaders of
  the Second International, even though they continue a most resolute and irreconcilable
  struggle against counter-revolutionary Social Democracy.</p>

  <p>More than anything, China needs to free itself from military encirclement and to
  avoid war on two fronts. What could be more helpful in that respect than a more or less
  definitive settlement of the border issue which would relieve both socialist countries
  of the necessity of concentrating huge military forces against each other, rather than
  having them in combat readiness against the imperialist powers? It is impossible for
  anyone but an incurable dogmatist to arrive at any other conclusion.</p>

  <p>...............................................</p>

  <p>Revisionism as an ideology and opportunism as practice has long been dominant in the
  Soviet Union. It antedates the split with the Chinese CP. But the conclusion that
  Soviet society has undergone a basic transformation in the sense that a new possessing
  class has taken firm hold of the reins of society and is running it on the basis of
  imperialist, that is, bourgeois private property interests in the epoch of imperialist
  decay is a falsification of history which will not long withstand the test of time.</p>

  <h4>REVISIONISM IS NOT IMPERIALISM</h4>

  <p>The Soviet bureaucracy has many traits in common with imperialist politicians. But
  it also is the representative of a developing social system, although it is burdened
  with many retrogressive features which are all too obvious. It needs peace for further
  development, whereas the real imperialists need war for sheer survival. The difference
  between the Soviet and imperialist systems is of fundamental concern to the world
  proletariat even if the political policies pursued by the current Soviet leadership are
  in the main erroneous and a departure from Marxism-Leninism.</p>

  <p>There are many reasons why the talks in Peking may blow up. And the political
  character of the Soviet leadership is probably the most important obstacle to a
  mutually satisfactory agreement. But the art of conducting a revolutionary policy in
  the field of relations between states lies precisely in analyzing the social
  contradictions in each of the states with which a revolutionary government has to deal:
  in the case of the Soviet Union, the contrast between the Soviet bureaucracy and the
  Socialist system of the USSR.</p>

  <h4>CHINA ASKS FOR PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT</h4>

  <p>The government of the People's Republic of China has stated that it has taken the
  initiative in starting these talks. On Oct. 7, 1969, the People's Republic of China
  said, "The Chinese Government has never covered up the fact that there exist
  irreconcilable differences of principle between China and the Soviet Union and that the
  struggle of principle between them will continue for a long period of time." The phrase
  "irreconcilable differences of principle" is an oblique allusion to the existence of
  the ideological struggle on a party-to-party basis, which would be totally irrelevant
  in a diplomatic document if the Chinese CP somehow, in the back of its mind, did not
  still regard the Soviet Union as a socialist state rather than an imperialist power.
  Otherwise, why allude to the ideological question? These are carefully chosen words.
  They are an absolutely correct statement of the Marxist-Leninist approach regarding the
  ideological struggle between the leadership of the People's Republic of China and the
  Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>"But this," continues the document "should not prevent China and the Soviet Union
  from maintaining normal state relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
  Coexistence. The Chinese Government has consistently held that the Sino-Soviet boundary
  question should be settled peacefully, and even if it cannot be settled for the time
  being, the status quo of the border should be maintained and there should definitely be
  no resort to the use of force. There is no reason whatsoever for China and the Soviet
  Union to fight a war over the boundary question," the statement concludes.</p>

  <p>This statement completely coincides with the views expressed by Workers World Party
  at the outbreak of the hostilities between China and the Soviet Union and contained to
  the March 20, 1969, edition of <em>Workers World.</em></p>
