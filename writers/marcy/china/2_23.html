  <title>China and the Class War 1959-1972 [Sam Marcy]</title>

  <h5>China and the Class War 1959-1972 [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Washington's Escalation and Vietnam's<br />
  Socialist Allies in the "United Nations"</h1>

  <h4>December 31, 1971</h4>

  <p>The resumption of massive bombing over North Vietnam is a mad, Hitlerite attempt by
  the Pentagon and the Nixon Administration to win through air power a war they have lost
  in ten years of bitter fighting. They are pounding the villages and countryside of
  North Vietnam in a vengeful action that flies in the face of every diplomatic and
  political posture assumed by Washington since the Tet offensive brought about the
  downfall of Lyndon Johnson and the first steps toward supposedly "winding down" the
  war.</p>

  <p>The unpopularity of the war among the masses in this country, as well as all over
  the world, and the fear within the U.S. ruling class itself that to continue the war
  could risk explosive revolutionary developments at home and abroad, have long been
  acknowledged by most of the policy planners in Washington. Why, then, this abrupt
  about-face that is sure to deepen the disaffection of the masses and further reveal the
  murderous violence at the core of American "democracy" and "free enterprise"?</p>

  <p>Why does Washington feel emboldened to carry out such a dastardly deed, without even
  manufacturing another Gulf of Tonkin hoax or coming up with any kind of excuse at
  all?</p>

  <p>Part of the answer lies in the unwillingness of any ruling class to accept its own
  defeat &mdash; a problem that the oppressed are always going to have to deal with in
  shaping a correct strategy.</p>

  <p>But besides this, there is an added reason why the most rabid adventurers in the
  Pentagon can at this particular time convince the generals of industry and finance that
  the military advantages of the bombing will outweigh the political drawbacks. They are
  taking advantage of the open and acrimonious split between the Soviet Union and
  People's China which imperialism calculates will paralyze these two allies of the
  Vietnamese people.</p>

  <p>This split has nowhere been more openly aired in front of the capitalist world than
  in the UN during the debate on the India-Pakistan War. The two socialist countries
  condemned each other in the strongest language but did not, as we pointed out at the
  time, expose U.S. imperialism either for its long role in exacerbating the situation on
  the subcontinent or for its hypocrisy in calling for "peace" and a withdrawal of Indian
  troops from Bangla Desh while it was involved in the bloody Vietnam war.</p>

  <p>Now the time has come when People's China could take advantage of its recent
  admission to the UN, and the Soviet Union could show its firm support of a beleaguered
  ally, by raising in that forum a resolution denouncing U.S. imperialism for this
  ferocious aggression. Why hasn't this been done, we ask our comrades? Why have you not
  branded the U.S. with just a fraction of the vehemence that you showed against each
  other just a few short weeks ago?</p>

  <p>This is the question that is on the minds of the progressive workers and oppressed
  of the world, and this is what they want to see done by their comrades more than
  anything else. The main enemy of the revolution, of humanity's socialist future, of the
  emancipation of all the toilers, is U.S. monopoly capitalism. It has just committed a
  crime that is foul and cowardly if the representatives of People's China can find the
  breath to condemn India for aggression, when India is, despite its capitalist
  character, itself a nation oppressed by imperialism, then why can't you comrades, use
  the UN to carry on a campaign against the biggest aggressor of them all?</p>

  <p>And the Soviet Union, which has sat on the Security Council since the UN's
  formation, has the power to convene that body whenever a crisis occurs. This is
  certainly a crisis for the Vietnamese people, and it is moreover a crisis for all whose
  struggles for liberation are threatened by the B-52s and fighter bombers at the
  disposal of the capitalist class. What possible justification is there for
  participating in this imperialist dominated "international" organization and not using
  the powers at your disposal to aid your class brothers and sisters?</p>

  <p>This is not to say that we think the UN should intervene in Vietnam. The record of
  UN interventions in the Congo and Korea has always been to thwart the revolutionary
  aspirations of the people But if there is any justification, we repeat, for the two
  most powerful socialist countries to be in the UN, it would be, at the very least, to
  use that forum to speak out against imperialist crimes and try to rally the workers'
  states and the oppressed nations for a united stand in condemnation against their
  enemy's aggression. If they find it impossible to do this. then they should walk out of
  this "thieves' kitchen" in protest.</p>
