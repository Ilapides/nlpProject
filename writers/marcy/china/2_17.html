  <h1>The New Turn in U.S.-China Relations</h1>

  <h4>April 23, 1971</h4><em>By SAM MARCY</em>

  <p>The People's Republic of China has been in the forefront of the world revolutionary
  movement ever since the victory of the Chinese Revolution and the ouster of the Chiang
  Kai-Shek regime. No socialist state since the death of Lenin has been such a mighty
  fortress of the socialist revolution as has the People's Republic of China. It has been
  an inspiration and an example to all the liberation movements of the world.</p>

  <p>By its very existence, as well as by its general political policies, it has been a
  source of incalculable political, moral and material support in the struggle against
  imperialism. The PRC, however, has had to fight for its very existence ever since it
  established itself as the People's Government of China. Throughout these many long and
  difficult years U.S. imperialism and its satellites have been China's main and
  fundamental opponent.</p>

  <h4>TABLE TENNIS INVITATION ACCEPTED</h4>

  <p>U.S. monopoly capital has never, ever for a moment, let up in the struggle to
  overthrow People's China. By every conceivable military, political and diplomatic means
  Washington has sought to contain, isolate and, if possible, wreck the PRC. The fact
  that China has survived it all, and has surmounted all the obstacles put in its way is
  eloquent testimony to the strength and durability of its new social structure. People's
  China has become a world power of such tremendous importance that the U.S., can no
  longer pretend to ignore its existence. Faced with terrifying domestic and
  international crises of an unprecedented character, it was inevitable that the U.S.,
  ruling class would make an overture to People's China by choosing to accept at this
  time the invitation extended to the table tennis team.</p>

  <p>This in a large measure explains some, but not all, of the reasons behind the recent
  turn in the relations between the U.S., and China. The PRC initiated attempts at
  diplomatic relations with the U.S., as early as 1950 and sought recognition for China
  on the basis of its full sovereignty, which includes the restoration of Taiwan as an
  integral part of the People's Republic and the seating of China in the UN instead of
  the quisling Chiang regime.</p>

  <h4>APPREHENSION IN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT</h4>

  <p>In the light of the continuing ascendancy of revisionism in the international
  communist movement, a considerable section of the revolutionary movement here is
  apprehensive that the new turn in the relationship between China and the U.S., may
  herald a retreat from revolutionary principle. Capitalist, revisionist and social
  democratic propaganda on that subject is very strong, naturally. However, many sincere
  and revolutionary friends of China are also apprehensive. Only subsequent developments
  can ultimately dispel this apprehension. In the meantime, there is no objective
  evidence whatsoever that would give these fears any solid foundation.</p>

  <p>Ever since the table tennis team got its invitation to visit China the capitalist
  press, its social democratic lackeys and the revisionists have let loose a torrent of
  speculation over the alleged motivation behind China's offer to begin the normalization
  of relations with the U.S. These speculations boil down to this: that China's bid to
  normalize relations with the U.S., is calculated to aid Nixon in Indochina just at a
  time when the U.S., has suffered a catastrophic defeat in Laos; that it is also an
  attempt to counteract the growing Soviet influence in the Mideast and to pave the way
  for a U.S.-China alliance against the USSR.</p>

  <p>The Chinese People's Republic has absolutely no interest whatsoever in giving any
  aid to Nixon in his mad adventure in Asia. There is not an iota of evidence to sustain
  this charge. We have every reason to believe the statement of the Vietnamese spokesman
  at the Paris Peace Conference who answered this precise allegation by categorically
  stating that China's foreign policy in relationship to Indochina is "invariable" and
  its support "unlimited."</p>

  <p>Everything that China has said and done during these many years in relationship to
  giving fraternal aid and assistance to the Indo-Chinese people in the fight against
  U.S., imperialism is incontrovertible proof of China's loyalty to the Indo-Chinese
  liberation struggle and underscores the statement of confidence made by the Vietnamese.
  Any illusion on this score in the camp of the bourgeoisie and its satellites will soon
  be dispelled.</p>

  <h4>THE SOVIET REVISIONIST POSlTION:<br />
  KOSYGIN BACKED OVERTHROW OF MAO</h4>

  <p>The Soviet revisionists are the ones who are most dismayed by the whole development.
  They think that this may be the beginning of a bloc against the USSR. Even if that were
  true &mdash; and it is as yet a long way from it &mdash; they would have no one to
  blame but themselves. An alliance, to the extent that it exists, is still between the
  U.S., and the USSR against China.</p>

  <p>Do these people think that the world has forgotten the long, vicious campaign by the
  Moscow leadership to overthrow the revolutionary leadership of Mao Tse-tung? Can anyone
  have forgotten that it was only a few years ago that Kosygin, the Premier, in a visit
  to London openly proclaimed his solidarity with Liu Shao-chi and virtually called for
  the overthrow of the Mao regime. So brazen were Kosygin's remarks that the New York
  Times asked wistfully "Are you calling for an alliance against China?" and virtually
  answered "We're going to play it coy."</p>

  <blockquote>
    "We are aware there are today in China," said Kosygin during a visit to London in
    January-February 1967, "in the Communist party of China, and in the Chinese
    Government, people who are struggling against the dictatorial regime of Mao
    Tse-tung." And then he added, "We sympathize with them."
  </blockquote>

  <p>The New York Times, commenting upon this remarkable statement editorialized early in
  February 1967:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Mr. Kosygin spoke in his capacity as Premier of the Soviet Union while in the
    capital of a 'capitalist' nation.

    <p>"His point could scarcely have been registered in more arresting fashion if he had
    said the same thing in front of the White House with President Johnson at his
    side."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The attacks by the revisionists against the PRC for trying to normalize relations
  comes in bad grace. Their denunciations are entirely actuated by reactionary
  considerations &mdash; since the USSR leaders have been promoting an accommodation with
  the U.S., for years in order to isolate People's China. The relationship between Moscow
  and Washington has become truly scandalous. How can the Soviet leaders turn around now
  and say "Don't do it," when they themselves have been and still are doing it.</p>

  <p>Naturally the revisionists cannot conceive of having normal diplomatic relations
  with an imperialist country without engaging in class betrayal. In this they are trying
  to impute their own practices to the Chinese leaders.</p>

  <p>Of course U.S., imperialism has always tried to play off the USSR against China and
  China against the USSR and always will. This is one of the cornerstones of imperialist
  foreign policy in the epoch of the emergence of socialist states. It is this policy,
  aided by the growth of revisionism in the USSR, which is objectively responsible for
  the split in the socialist camp in the first place.</p>

  <p>That being the case, all the more is it incumbent upon the Soviet leadership to
  abandon its policy of class collaboration with imperialism and return the Soviet Union
  to a policy of proletarian class collaboration with China, the other revolutionary
  socialist countries and the world revolutionary movement. Only in that way will the
  machinations of U.S., imperialism be frustrated.</p>

  <h4>THE SWP POSITION</h4>

  <p>Another voice &mdash; a neo-social democratic tendency in this country which has
  been violently opposed to revolutionary China &mdash; is that represented by the
  Socialist Workers Party (SWP). In their publication the Intercontinental Press of
  April, 1971, they characterize China's attempt at normalization of relations with the
  U.S., as a "timely assist for Nixon." The SWP too is trying to discredit Chinese
  attempts to normalize relationships with the imperialist West. They too are arguing
  from utterly reactionary and counterrevolutionary considerations.</p>

  <h4>SWP, REVISIONISTS BOTH ATTACKED 
  THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION</h4>

  <p>One should ask these people, who now throw revolutionary phrases at China: "What was
  your role during the Cultural Revolution &mdash; the revolution which saved China from
  bourgeois restoration? Which side did you take? Did you not join with the revisionists
  and give objective aid and assistance to the counterrevolution, although giving
  different arguments?" The true test of a revolutionary was the position on the Cultural
  Revolution. Both Moscow and Washington, including all their liberal social democratic
  allies in this country, were dead set against that revolution. Now suddenly these
  neo-social democrats are denouncing China for not being revolutionary!</p>

  <p>At the time when the social democrats of all hues, including Moscow revisionism,
  were attacking the Cultural Revolution, we wrote the following in Workers World of
  January 20, 1967:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "The cardinal fact that emerges from the sum and substance of the dispute is that the
    Chinese CP may be fighting the crucial battle for socialism, which, if lost, would
    set the proletarian and liberation movements of the world back for decades. The
    alternative to the present leadership and its political line, it must be faced
    squarely, is a neo-bourgeois restorationist regime. That is what really is at stake
    in the Cultural Revolution in China." Our article was headlined: "The Stakes in
    China's Internal Struggle: Revolution vs. Restoration."
  </blockquote>

  <h4>NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS CORRECT IN PRINCIPLE</h4>

  <p>But is the approach made by People's China to the U.S., correct in principle? Yes.
  China is trying to normalize its relationship with the imperialist West &mdash; with
  the U.S. &mdash; and this is perfectly correct. It is correct for a socialist
  government to enter into a diplomatic agreement with an imperialist country for
  purposes of maintaining normal commercial, trade and social exchanges. The criterion as
  to whether these agreements are proper and appropriate is the manner in which they
  affect the international class struggle against imperialism. If they blunt the class
  struggle, if they make the struggle against imperialism more difficult or confuse the
  masses of the people on the true character and intentions of the imperialists, or
  materially affect the course of socialist construction &mdash; then they are
  counterproductive from a proletarian class point of view and in the long run harmful to
  the socialist government in question. These are some of the questions that are raised
  every time a socialist country negotiates with an imperialist country.</p>

  <p>Based on the above criteria, there is nothing in the conduct of China in its
  normalization efforts with the U.S., so far as anyone can see at present, which is
  improper or harmful to proletarian and socialist class interests.</p>
