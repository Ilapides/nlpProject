  <h1>U.S. Bombs Vietnam on Eve of China Trip</h1>

  <h4>February 16, 1972</h4>

  <p>After over 20 years of officially pretending that the People's Republic of China
  didn't exist, U.S. imperialism has dramatically reversed itself, and is sending
  President Nixon to Peking. This startling decision is still causing reverberations in
  ruing class circles, and foreign capitalist governments allied to the U.S. are trying
  to figure out the significance this turn in U.S.-Chinese relations will have for them.
  Within the international working class movement, a number of interpretations of the
  visit have been offered. Some see the visit as purely a victory for the Asian
  revolution, and speak of Nixon going to Peking "on his knees."</p>

  <p>It is absolutely true that U.S. imperialism has suffered a disastrous defeat in
  Asia. The Vietnamese liberation fighters have demonstrated their superiority on the
  battlefield in spite of overwhelming odds in technology and materiel. Beginning with
  the abdication of Johnson and continuing through the publication of the Pentagon
  Papers, Workers World has again and again printed to the signs of a serious crisis
  within the U.S. ruing class brought about by their defeats in Vietnam. The U.S. has
  also learned that it could not bring about the counterrevolutionary overturn of the
  People's Republic of China, even with a combination of military encirclement, two hot
  wars on China's borders in Korea and Vietnam, a political cold war, and a total
  economic embargo. The revolutionary dynamic in China spurred on its economic growth,
  and the U.S. was helpless to stop it.</p>

  <p>After so many failures, it is obvious that imperialism is now trying a new tactic
  But it would be terribly wrong for anyone in this country to think that their basic
  strategy is altered in any way. That strategy is based on implacable hostility to the
  socialist mode of production, both at home and abroad, and the absolute necessity, for
  the survival of their system, to find new avenues to exploit the workers and oppressed
  in every comer of the globe.</p>

  <p>Nixon feels he has a great deal to gain, internally and internationally, from this
  visit. Here at home, he is creating a new image in an election year. Richard Nixon the
  reactionary is transformed, via the medium of continuous television coverage of has
  trip, into a man of peace and understanding, trying to seek a solution to the world's
  problems, and ready to go to the ends of the earth to find it. This is the hypocritical
  mask the chief executive of imperialism has donned, while at the same time he directs
  the murderous bombings going on in Vietnam, imposes a wage freeze on American workers,
  proposes a budget that would again saddle the people with a staggering arms bill that
  cannot help but drive up inflation, and commands the never ending war against Black
  America with its Atticas and Baton Rouges.</p>

  <p>While he is dealing for the first time with 700 million Chinese, he will not be
  taking one representative of the Black news media with him. In the hordes of newsmen
  who will be sending back tons of laudatory copy, not one will be accredited to any of
  the hundreds of Black newspapers, news services, or radio stations in this country. Is
  any more evidence needed that Nixon and his collaborators who have arranged this trip
  remain diehard racists?</p>

  <p>Nixon is not going to China to beg for mercy or to turn over a new leaf. He is going
  in an attempt to bolster up imperialism, get out of the crisis of the last decade, and
  explore the possibilities of new diplomatic alignments to achieve the same old
  ends.</p>

  <p>People's China is of course aware of this. To believe otherwise would be to grossly
  underestimate the political astuteness and experience of her leaders. And, after many
  years of harassment and isolation, China has every right to try and normalize state
  relations with the U.S., just as she has done with many other capitalist countries.</p>

  <p>But it is not necessary to invite the head of state of the most murderous,
  oppressive regime in the world to visit China for a week in order to reach an
  understanding on the normalization of state relations. This can be done, and was done
  in Lenin's day, through an exchange of diplomats in a way that all the workers and
  oppressed can see there are no deals being made over their heads China has in the past
  correctly criticized the revisionist Soviet leaders for sacrificing the international
  struggles of the workers and oppressed to the narrow national interests of the Soviet
  Union Now the Soviet revisionists are having a field day returning the criticism,
  hoping they can thereby justify their own conduct toward the imperialists.</p>

  <p>It is particularly inappropriate for People's China to receive Nixon at thus time.
  Each day the news of U.S. bombings in Vietnam is more horrendous than the last. There
  was speculation last summer when the visit was first made public that this would mean
  an immediate tapering off of the war. This has not happened and the Nixon visit is seen
  in the eyes of the world through the smoke and flames of the U.S. war in Vietnam. This
  is not to say that the Vietnamese should not take advantage of Nixon's visit, if at all
  possible, to further negotiations for a U.S. withdrawal from Southeast Asia. We note
  that Le Duc Tho, senior North Vietnamese negotiator at the Paris peace talks, will be
  arriving in Peking the day before Nixon. Peking is certainly as good a place as Paris
  for any negotiations, and the Vietnamese are correct to take advantage of any situation
  that presents itself. However, Nixon's trip to Peking at this time <em>strengthens</em>
  the U.S. politically in its overall world position, just at a time when the Vietnamese
  war had brought U.S. influence in the world to an all-time ebb. We do not think this
  can help either the Vietnamese or &mdash; in the long run &mdash; the revolutionary
  masses of China.</p>

  <p>Speculation is abundant in the U.S. press that Nixon hopes to reach an understanding
  with China against the Soviet Union. The Wall Street Journal, by its very name directed
  to the corporate ruling class, speaks of a "Sino-U.S. tie to harass the Russians." The
  New York Times is also discussing the possibility of U.S.-Chinese cooperation against
  the Soviet Union in Asia. While much of thus may be "trial balloon" journalism intended
  to alarm the Soviet leaders and make the split with China irrevocable, it shows how
  quickly the imperialists take advantage of any opening to split the socialist countries
  from each other. Only a short while ago they were talking of the "dogmatism" of the
  Chinese vs. the more "reasonable" attitude of the Soviets.</p>

  <p>The profound changes wrought all over the world &mdash; and in the U.S. particularly
  &mdash; in the last decade should prove even to the skeptical that great leaps in
  consciousness arise from uncompromising struggle The interests of the workers and
  oppressed in every country lie in deepening that struggle, tearing off the mask from
  imperialism, exposing the rulers of this country for the racists and oppressors that
  they are. We think that this end would be served more effectively if People's China
  were to say: "No imperialist murderers are welcome in this land of workers and
  peasants!"</p>
