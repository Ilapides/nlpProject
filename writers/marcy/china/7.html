  <h1>China and Albania</h1>

  <h3>The reemergence of Teng</h3>

  <h4>July 26, 1977</h4>

  <p>The reemergence of Teng Hsiao-ping to almost the same preeminent position he held in
  the party and government before he was purged comes almost as an anticlimactic event.
  In reality, the political beheading of Chiang Ching, Yao Wen-yuan, Chang Chun-chiao,
  Wang Hung-wen, and countless but unannounced hundreds of thousands of others signalled
  the triumph of the rightist opposition, led by Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping, over
  the Maoist policies and the revolutionary struggles of the Cultural Revolution of more
  than a decade.</p>

  <p>Teng's reinstatement ends a cycle in the revolutionary development of China. It
  signifies that the Heroic Age of China's Revolution is over. indeed, it has probably
  been over for a longer period than had been previously believed.</p>

  <p>The new era that is now unfolding in China is the age of the bourgeois pragmatists.
  But this does not at all mean that the bourgeoisie has been restored to power in
  China.</p>

  <h4>OVERTURN OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION</h4>

  <p>This event confirms a historical trend to the right which in effect overturned and
  discredited the aims and objectives of the Cultural Revolution &mdash; the revolution
  which was aimed at curbing bureaucratic excesses, at prohibiting enormous privileges
  and emoluments to the upper crust in Chinese society. The Cultural Revolution had
  combatted those enormous material incentives which tend to cultivate a class
  differentiation in the peasantry, the working class, and especially in the so-called
  managerial class, that stratum in Chinese society which holds such a central role in
  planning, management, administration, and the various fields of science, technology,
  and industrial know-how.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly much will be attributed to the personal traits of Teng, especially his
  cunning and his ability to survive during periods of revolutionary storms, to once
  again be reinstated after having been cast into purgatory twice during Mao's lifetime.
  But personal traits, important though they are in the political struggle, are not what
  is really decisive.</p>

  <p>The basic point which accounts for his reemergence is that the counter-current, the
  current against the Cultural Revolution, proved in the final analysis to be predominant
  and overwhelmed the left opposition.</p>

  <p>Neither Chiang Ching nor Yao Wen-yuan, certainly not Wang Hung-wen, the sole strong
  revolutionary leader who emerged from the Shanghai working class, and not even Chang
  Chun-chiao held any great sway in the planning and management sector of the economy
  &mdash; which of course is very important in a socialist country. Nor did they enjoy
  much loyalty or adherence from this sector to the Maoist doctrine. Contrary to what
  Mao's detractors are now hinting, his doctrine did not seek to belittle the
  significance of technology in the construction of socialism, but to make the masses the
  ultimate historical instrument in shaping their own socialist destiny.</p>

  <p>Teng's relation to Mao is best summed up in Mao's own commentary on Teng. "Teng
  Hsiao-ping is deaf [hard of hearing] but at meetings he would sit far away from me. In
  the six years since 1959 he has not reported to me about his work. He relies only on
  Peng Chen [former mayor of Peking and ally of the Liu-Teng faction] for the work of the
  secretariat." (Quoted by Edgar Snow in <em>The Long Revolution,</em> p. 83.)</p>

  <p>According to Snow, the only one of the many writers friendly to the Chinese
  Revolution who had long and extensive interviews with Mao over a period of years, among
  the important items that Teng failed to report to Mao was the policy of "the extension
  of plots for private use and of free markets, the increase of small enterprises with
  sole responsibility for their own profits and losses, and the fixing of output quotas
  [in communes] based on the household [individual] enterprises." This line of political
  divergence from Mao clearly puts Teng in the role of the early "liberalizers" who were
  then in the ascendant in the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>It did not, in the Teng world outlook, mean any particular subservience to the
  Soviet Union or agreement to be a subordinate partner in a Sino-Soviet alliance, but a
  sharing of views on the evolution of the economy, its management and direction, and the
  role of the state in the distribution of the national income vis-a-vis the different
  strata of the population.</p>

  <h4>TENG AND THE 'EUROCOMMUNISTS'</h4>

  <p>It was only a bare two years ago that Teng in his capacity as Deputy Prime Minister
  visited Paris to launch a virtual crusade to unify and strengthen NATO against the
  "greatest danger," Soviet "social-imperialism." He was then rudely rebuffed by George
  Marchais, the leader of the French CP.</p>

  <p>The incident is illustrative of how superficial appearances convey the impression of
  deep-seated differences in world outlook, which speedy developments soon tear to
  shreds. For the truth of the matter is that since 1975 the trends of social development
  make abundantly clear that the world outlook of Teng Hsiao-ping does not fundamentally
  differ from that of Marchais, Berlinguer, or Carrillo.</p>

  <p>These leaders of so-called Eurocommunism are actually leaders of social reformism,
  promoting the cause of the preservation of the capitalist system in their respective
  imperialist countries which are in irreconcilable conflict with the Soviet Union as a
  workers' state and a new, progressive social order.</p>

  <p>Teng represents the current Chinese version of what the Carrillos, Berlinguers, and
  Marchais' stand for in the way of renouncing and abandoning the revolutionary struggle
  for socialism. They are bound together, at last, by their lynch-pin of
  anti-Sovietism.</p>

  <p>They differ in this fundamental respect: Whereas Teng is anchored to a workers'
  state in a period of profound political reaction, the Marchais-Berlmguer-Carrillo
  grouping are reformists tied to the working class movement in a period of deep
  capitalist decline and resurgent aggressive political reaction and imperialist pressure
  at home and abroad from the U.S. Teng's social reformism is reformism on the foundation
  of a workers' state. The social reformism of the Eurocommunists is reformism based on
  workers' movements in the imperialist countries.</p>

  <p>Of course the whole kit and kaboodle of the theory of "social-imperialism" was
  introduced by Mao himself. It became the touchstone, as did the so-called "restoration
  of capitalism in the USSR" theory, of the struggle against the extension of
  Khrushchevite revisionism on the soil of the Chinese Revolution. In this fierce
  struggle the theory of "social-imperialism" and of the "restoration of capitalism in
  the USSR" was more of a highly excessive reaction against the domestic aspects of
  revisionism, of which Liu and Teng were the principal promoters, than a serious, sober
  appraisal of the class character of the USSR.</p>

  <p>Nowhere did this play more of a role than in the relations between China and
  Albania. The fact that Teng's reinstatement comes almost simultaneously with what
  amounts to a virtual end in the fraternal relations between China and Albania is deeply
  ironic and significant.</p>

  <h4>ALBANIA AND MAOIST DOCTRINE</h4>

  <p>Albania was very important, not just as a socialist ally to China, but because it
  seemed to confirm and validate the Maoist doctrine as a world ideology. None of the
  other socialist countries, not Vietnam, nor Laos or Korea, embraced the Cultural
  Revolution, promoted it, or in any way regarded it as more than a national phenomenon
  confined to China. None of the other socialist countries embraced the false super-power
  theory and the doctrine of "social-imperialism."</p>

  <p>Albania alone seemed to be the only follower of Mao among all the socialist
  countries. For that alone it was frequently and effusively praised.</p>

  <p>The fraternal relations between Albania and China seemed to be of a model character
  &mdash; what the relationship between a big socialist country and a small one ought to
  be. They demonstrated, seemingly, how solidarity in Marxist-Leninist ideology and
  correct socialist relations between fraternal parties with similar social structures
  could thrive and develop.</p>

  <p>Now all this has apparently come to an end, almost at the same time as the
  reemergence of Teng.</p>

  <p>It is not true, however, that ideological considerations were the only ones that
  moved the Albanian party leadership in the direction of China. A great deal of this
  ideological agreement stemmed from the original relationship between the Albanian
  Peoples Republic established in 1945, and Yugoslavia, which at the time held a
  preeminent position in Eastern Europe. Both Tito and the Yugoslav Revolution had
  attained tremendous prestige as a result of the victorious liberation struggle
  conducted against fascist aggression during the Second World War. But at the time of
  the split between Yugoslavia and the USSR, Albania was in a difficult position.</p>

  <p>According to Yugoslav sources after the split, especially Djilas in his book
  <em>Conversations with Stalin</em> and Dedijer's book <em>Tito,</em> Stalin appeared to
  be urging Tito "to swallow up" Albania. There is no way to confirm this, as both the
  sources are extremely tendentious and Djilas is an out-and-out counter-revolutionary.
  But the existence of an Albanian ethnic minority in Yugoslavia under oppressive
  conditions, notwithstanding much-touted social achievements and material improvements
  by the Yugoslav authorities, has been an ever-present concern of the Albanian
  government and people.</p>

  <p>It is possible that Albania as a Balkan state might have become part of a federation
  with Yugoslavia, or that Tito might have been interested in achieving such a
  federation. In the period right after World War II, he had expressed interest in
  forming a Balkan federation in East Europe, and even Dimitrov, the Bulgarian leader,
  lent support to it. The latter was immediately rebuked in a public statement by Pravda,
  which scotched the plan.</p>

  <h4>ALBANIA DIFFERED ON CZECHOSLOVAKIA</h4>

  <p>All this is important in viewing the later developments of the ideological struggle
  against Khrushchevite revisionism, especially since Albania and China had in reality
  differing appraisals of the Warsaw Pact intervention in Czechoslovakia. The Albanians
  had conducted a far more realistic and more accurate appraisal of the deepening of
  revisionist trends in Eastern Europe, which of course both China and Albania correctly
  held to be the responsibility of the so-called de-Stalinization efforts of the
  Khrushchev era in the first place.</p>

  <p>But as the struggle between the two trends in Eastern Europe developed, particularly
  in Czechoslovakia, the Albanians stressed more the aspect that the Soviet leadership
  under Brezhnev was a continuation and deepening of the Khrushchev period and that the
  development of the "liberalizers" and the so-called Spring Thaw in Czechoslovakia
  demonstrated that the Soviet bureaucracy, which had introduced the deepening
  revisionist trend, was now incapable of arresting it. Their position clearly reflected
  the view that the Czechoslovak developments were <strong>reactionary</strong> and were
  leading to bourgeois counter-revolution similar to what had taken place in Hungary in
  1956, and that the Soviet bureaucracy was either too cowardly or too helpless to do
  anything about it.</p>

  <p>They wrote in the March 24, 1968, <em>Zeri i Popullit,</em> "The new Czech
  counter-revolutionaries resort to new and multilateral methods. They attach great
  importance to the complete taking into their hands of the internal situation, without
  neglecting foreign policy. <strong>Naturally, out of demagogy, they openly speak of
  friendship with the Soviet Union, in order to completely undermine it.</strong></p>

  <p>"Their principal aim is the liquidation of Novotny and of his clique which is for
  the Soviet revisionist leadership and the reduction of the relations with the Soviet
  Union to mere trade relations. In the van of the campaign for the liquidation of
  Novotny, for his exposure, his compromisation and, finally, for his removal were the
  Slovak nationalists and the anti-Czech chauvinists, also the old bourgeois
  intellectuals and the new revisionist intellectuals as well as the students and
  hooligans who came out and still come out in demonstrations.</p>

  <p>"... it (the Dubcek clique) enjoys the guaranty of the West ... [and] the interests
  of world capitalism are visible in central Europe and Czechoslovakia is its
  epicenter."</p>

  <p><em>Zeri i Popullit</em> asks, "What will the Soviets do? Nothing, but take Novotny
  into their old people's home, if the revisionists permit it, and give him a villa like
  Rakosi."</p>

  <p>It follows from their analysis that the intervention of the Warsaw Pact, which they
  had not expected, was no more than a defensive move against Czechoslovakia becoming the
  "epicenter of world capitalism," as they put it.</p>

  <p>But in 1968, during the fierce struggle that had been unfolding against the Liu
  Shao-chi and Teng forces, any kind of indication that the USSR had moved in a
  progressive direction and was in reality taking a defensive move against capitalist
  restoration could only have weakened the Maoist struggle against the domestic right.
  Thus, a real contradiction developed in China and Albania's respective appraisals of
  trends in Eastern Europe and later for all of Europe.</p>

  <h4>CHINA, ALBANIA, AND YUGOSLAVIA</h4>

  <p>It did not serve Albania's interest to proclaim the intervention in Czechoslovakia
  as counter-revolutionary and as evidence of "social-imperialist" aggression. For one
  thing, Tito, who had taken an ambivalent position on the Hungarian intervention in
  1956, in 1968 was aggressively anti-Soviet so far as the intervention went, and joined
  the chorus of Western imperialist denunciations. Moreover, he strengthened his armed
  forces and enlarged them, always regarded as a danger to Albania.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, under the impetus of unleashing a barrage of "social-imperialist"
  propaganda about the Czech intervention and the "danger" it posed everywhere in Europe,
  the Chinese press forgot in the meantime that Yugoslavia had originally been cast by
  the Chinese press in the role of a "fascist" state which had consummated a bourgeois
  counter-revolution and restored capitalism. Indeed, China now began to cast flirtatious
  glances at Yugoslavia and showed regard for its "struggle for independence," which
  could not possibly have found a great deal of credibility in Tirana.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the Albanian party, loyal in the general struggle against revisionism,
  dutifully followed along. But the split was inevitable when the Chinese press began
  more and more to highlight the "greater danger" from so-called social-imperialism and
  urged the Europeans to galvanize NATO. This imperialist alliance is clearly a danger to
  Albanian independence when one remembers that one of the anchors of the southern flank
  of NATO is Greece, Albania's next-door neighbor.</p>

  <p>And it shows that Albania's most recent polemic against China should center on
  China's thesis on the "Third World" and the "nonaligned" movement when one considers
  that Tito is one of the big wheels in the "non-aligned" movement.</p>

  <h4>SETBACKS IN TRANSITION TO A NEW WORLD ORDER</h4>

  <p>Our epoch is in many ways similar to that long and protracted period of the
  transition from feudalism to capitalism. In particular, our contemporary period bears
  strong resemblance to the Renaissance: a tremendous era of great hopes and new
  anticipations, but also an era of great disillusionment and disenchantment, and periods
  of passivity on the part of large masses of people who otherwise would be in convulsive
  mass action.</p>

  <p>A period of transition from one social order to another, from a dying social system
  to a new world social order, is long and protracted and entails many acute
  contradictions, by the hopes it sets in motion, by the inevitable setbacks, and more
  often by the cynicism as well as corruption which it breeds, which leads bourgeois
  historians and commentators to come back to that old, old standby on the "essential
  character of Man" &mdash; the inherent nature and fragility of the human species, so
  forth and so on.</p>

  <p>But the reality of the situation is that in a protracted period when two worlds are
  in struggle and defeats are inflicted upon both sides of the divergent class systems,
  disillusionment and disenchantment by temporary setbacks are bound to bring to the
  surface precisely those negative social trends which are characteristic of the older,
  decadent order of society.</p>

  <p>But this is of a purely temporary character, in the long run, no matter what the
  setbacks in the socialist countries, no matter what severe trials and tribulations the
  working class and the oppressed peoples may endure as a result of the defection of
  leaders and the succumbing of certain strata of the population to the class enemy, the
  ultimate result cannot be anything else but the socialist reorganization of the planet
  on the basis of serving human need.</p>
