  <h1>Revolution vs. Restoration<br />
  China's Internal Struggle (Part 2)</h1>

  <h3>Dual Power</h3>

  <h4>February 3, 1967</h4><em>By SAM MARCY</em>

  <p>During the course of every genuine popular revolutionary upheaval, there ensues a
  temporary period of widespread political confusion and bewilderment, when literally
  millions are preoccupied with the issue of "who is in authority." When this happens, it
  is an indubitable sign that elements of the old authority are being broken down or
  shattered and a new authority is in the process of emerging. Such a period is
  invariably accompanied by high political tension and bitter conflict. It is a distinct
  sign of deep social crisis and indicates that the hitherto stable equilibrium of
  hostile and competing social classes has either been gravely disturbed or is on the
  verge of being destroyed.</p>

  <p>The political form that has characterized such a crisis in previous historical
  epochs of revolutionary upheavals is known as dual power &mdash; a transitional period
  which must inevitably lead to the definitive victory of one power center or the other
  &mdash; that is, either to the further development and stabilization of the new
  authority or, as the case may be, toward restoration of the old.</p>

  <p>In any event, it is a period marked by extraordinary conflicts of exceptional
  sharpness and intensity, dislocation of the social order, sometimes utter chaos. And by
  the very nature of this period, it can only be of a relatively short duration.</p>

  <p>Such a situation prevails today in the People's Republic of China. "Certain people
  in authority &mdash; those that are taking the capitalist road" are being
  unceremoniously removed by large masses of militant revolutionary young people whose
  authority to do these things is being challenged by others, whose authority in turn,
  was hitherto unchallenged.</p>

  <h4>RED GUARDS ROOTED IN WORKING CLASS</h4>

  <p>The elements of dual power in China, while still in the process of formation, have
  nevertheless emerged clearly enough to be positively identified. On the one hand there
  is the existence of the Red Guards, a mighty, several million-fold organization of
  youth, drawing from the student, proletarian and poor peasant masses. It is not an
  artificially created or artificially fostered organization as the ruling class press at
  the beginning tried to make us believe.</p>

  <p>More recent reports from imperialist sources make clear the validity and
  authenticity of the Red Guard organization. Such, for instance, are the dispatches from
  Bill Baggs (distributed by Associated Press, January 21 and 22, 1967, carried in the
  Miami News and New York Post) which stress the spontaneous beginnings of the Red
  Guards. And the testimony of Minoru Amori, a Japanese correspondent, who in his efforts
  to probe the identity of the Red Guards during his stay in China reported in the
  January 28, 1967, New Republic that he found the Red Guards consisted mainly of "the
  offspring of revolutionary leaders &mdash; those killed in the early struggle, poor
  agrarian families and industrial workers. This convinced me that the 'cultural
  revolution' is a real proletarian revolution."</p>

  <p>Alongside the Red Guards there have sprouted up in response to the call of Mao
  Tse-tung and the Central Committee, innumerable organizations and committees in all
  fields of social life, and they are spreading rapidly throughout the country. These are
  in turn buttressed by the PLA (People's Liberation Army).</p>

  <h4>THE ARMY IS REVOLUTIONARY</h4>

  <p>A great deal of valid speculation has arisen in the capitalist press about the
  loyalty of the PLA. The army in any society is a reflection of the class relations in
  that society. The PLA has always been a profoundly dedicated and revolutionary army.
  There is no solid basis for believing that this has changed. The abolition of rank
  during the tenure of Defense Minister Lin Piao must have done much to strengthen the
  ties between the rank and file and the leading military cadres and between the army
  generally and the mass of the people.</p>

  <p>The Red Guards, the various new committees, the PLA, and the party rank and file are
  in turn supported, encouraged, and led by Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Defense Minister
  Lin Piao and the Central Committee. These constitute the revolutionary elements in the
  equation of dual power.</p>

  <h4>THE HOPES OF THE BOURGEOISIE</h4>

  <p>On the other side of the equation are the now world-famous "handful of persons
  within the party who are now in authority and are taking the capitalist road." Who are
  they?</p>

  <p>We believe them to be a substantial section of the party apparatus and officials of
  high as well as low rank who are exercising a vast amount of political authority. They
  in turn reflect the aspirations and strength of what has been called, for want of a
  better name, the "managerial class" &mdash; a conglomerate privileged grouping
  constituting the new officialdom &mdash; the social grouping on which the bourgeoisie,
  their agents and allies the world over, bank their hopes for a return to power in
  China. This is the reactionary element in the equation of dual power.</p>

  <h4>HOW RUSK CHOOSES SIDES</h4>

  <p>Secretary of State Dean Rusk declared on January 26th "that neither he nor Mao could
  make out what was going on in China today." Aside from the gratuitous inclusion of
  Chairman Mao's name, Rusk's remark is extremely revealing. "While not knowing what is
  going on in China," he, nevertheless, has a firm position in the struggle. He is one
  hundred percent against Chairman Mao Tse-tung and his revolutionary government and
  would welcome practically any other regime as an alternative. This is not merely the
  attitude of an individual representative of the bourgeoisie. It is universally true of
  the entire ruling class. For them, the situation may not be clear but their class
  attitude to the protagonists in the arena of struggle is absolutely beyond
  question.</p>

  <p>Would that many progressives who "cannot make out what is going on in China today"
  also take a parallel attitude but in the opposite class direction!</p>

  <p>Dual power has appeared as a characteristic of all the great social revolutions of
  the modern era. This is just as true of the Great October Socialist Revolution as it
  was true of the bourgeois revolution in Eighteenth Century France and Seventeenth
  Century Britain. The appearance of the Red Guards in the current Chinese revolution is
  a Twentieth Century proletarian version of the "sans culottes" of the French Bourgeois
  Revolution and the "Ironsides" army of the Cromwellian Revolution.</p>

  <h4>THE HOWLS OF THE RULING CLASS</h4>

  <p>The wrath which the contemporary ruling classes and the revisionist and social
  democratic allies have heaped on the heads of the brave and dedicated youth in the Red
  Guards recalls the abuse poured out by the arrogant representatives of the ancien
  regime on the sans culottes and the howls of righteous indignation of the
  representatives of the decadent British aristocracy against the Cromwellian army.</p>

  <p>To this very day, the bourgeois historians deliberately confuse and bewilder the
  readers by the distortions and in many cases outright falsifications of the true
  character of their very own revolutions which brought them to power. Should anyone then
  be surprised by the hysteria raised against the cultural revolution &mdash; a
  revolution which aims to raze to the ground the last vestiges of bourgeois authority as
  well as ideology?</p>

  <h4>"TO REBEL IS JUSTIFIED"</h4>

  <p>That the present stage of the Chinese Revolution is characterized by the emergence
  of dual power, that dual power exists, is clearly shown by the widespread use by the
  leadership of the revolution of the exhortative maxim: "In the last analysis all the
  truths of Marxism can be summed up in one sentence: 'To rebel is justified.'" For what
  other reason would a government leader employ a maxim which preaches rebellion against
  his own government if it were not for the existence of dual power, a condition which
  denotes the existence in the state structure of two basically incompatible political
  groups &mdash; one espousing "the revolutionary proletarian line" and the other "taking
  the capitalist road"?</p>

  <h4>THE NEW PHENOMENON</h4>

  <p>The current revolution in China has revealed a totally new phenomenon, a phenomenon
  that has not appeared in any of the socialist countries in the contemporary epoch,
  except for the early stages of the October Socialist Revolution. What is the new
  phenomenon? It is a conscious effort by the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party
  &mdash; Chairman Mao and Defense Minister Lin Piao to project the popular masses onto
  the political arena and to induce them <em>by their own efforts</em> and creative
  initiative to radically reconstruct the fabric of Chinese society along the "lines of
  the principles of the Paris Commune."</p>

  <p>This is one of the key, if not the key element of contention in the struggle. The
  Paris Commune has always been regarded as the model for a genuine proletarian
  dictatorship, ever since Lenin wrote his celebrated book, <em>State and
  Revolution.</em> Excluded in this concept, of course, is the mechanical transfer of the
  peculiarly local or national features of the Commune. What is regarded as the
  quintessence of the Paris Commune type of state is the thoroughly democratic and
  genuinely revolutionary <em>control</em> by the popular masses over the machinery of
  the state &mdash; by the workers and peasants as against the privileged officialdom. A
  thought long ago forgotten by the leaders of other socialist countries!</p>

  <h4>WORD AND DEED</h4>

  <p>But it has always been recognized in official pronouncements in all the socialist
  countries. And in one form or another the overthrow of the old social order was based
  on the recognition of the historical validity and relevancy of the Paris Commune as a
  model for the new socialist regimes. However, the gap between word and deed has over
  the years become all too apparent and the degeneration which has set in is in no small
  part due to an abandonment of any effort to follow the prototype of proletarian
  dictatorship &mdash; the Paris Commune.</p>

  <p>The Paris Commune type of state, it can now be seen more clearly than ever before,
  and must be categorically restated, is the real answer to the rule of the neo-bourgeois
  restorationist stratum which has grown up in the socialist countries.</p>

  <h4>"PRINCIPLES OF THE PARIS COMMUNE"</h4>

  <p>It is thus refreshing and highly gratifying to read in an editorial in Renmin Ribao,
  December 26th (reprinted in Peking Review No. 1) that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "A system of general elections must be instituted in accordance with the principles
    of the Paris Commune. Full deliberations must be carried out by the masses and the
    election conducted in a serious way. The members can be replaced through election or
    recalled by the masses at any time."

    <p>Furthermore: "The masses of workers have the right to set up every kind of
    revolutionary organization," and these organizations are "urged not to set up a
    bureaucratic apparatus or acquire a mass of equipment which divorce them from the
    masses."</p>

    <p>Finally: "Members of these organizations must not be appointed from above nor
    should there be behind the scenes manipulations."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h4>A HEALTHY ANTIDOTE</h4>

  <p>There are those who assert that all this should be regarded as just another
  programmatic document &mdash; that it is a mere declaration of intention.</p>

  <p>There is no reason whatsoever why full faith and credence should not be given to the
  pronouncements of the revolutionary leadership of the Chinese people in the context of
  present historical circumstances. The possibility for making them a living reality
  seems highly favorable and in any case such efforts are a healthy antidote to the
  regressive social tendencies in other socialist countries.</p>

  <p>One of the striking features of the crisis in China is the character of the inner
  party struggle. Why has the struggle been conducted in the Party against unnamed
  persons or groups? And why has it turned from what originally appeared to be a Party
  discussion of fundamental questions of policy into what is now called "an all-around
  test of strength between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and its agents in our
  Party"? (Renmin Ribao and Hongqi, January 1, 1967, reprinted in Peking Review No.
  1)</p>

  <h4>POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS AND CLASS CONFLICT</h4>

  <p>Certainly, it would be preferable to have an open, leisurely discussion of
  fundamental policy in the party and in the public organs of the party on the basis of
  minority and majority, and to embody the essential differences in resolutions subject
  to further discussions and vote by a party congress. However, serious party discussions
  are not just mere discussions. Party controversies over serious issues generally
  reflect the influence and interest of the classes in society.</p>

  <p>Basic class interests, however, cannot be resolved by minority and majority
  resolution even in the most revolutionary party. Classes generally do not permit the
  fate of their role in society to be determined by parliamentary mechanisms or even by
  validly constituted political organisms. The leaders of the proletarian revolution in
  China certainly could not permit the fate of their revolution and the destiny of China
  to be determined on that basis.</p>

  <p>However, it should be noted that Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Defense Minister Lin Piao
  represent the Central Committee of the Party and that it was the validly constituted
  plenary session of the Central Committee in August which passed the momentous decision
  on the cultural revolution.</p>

  <p>Whatever decisions this body has taken are binding under the Party's constitution,
  pending convocation of a Party congress. If the class struggle has broken out into the
  open in the meantime then the only recourse is to prosecute the struggle in behalf of
  the revolutionary line of the proletariat to a victorious conclusion.</p>
