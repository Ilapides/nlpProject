  <h5>China 1977: End of the Revolutionary Mao Era [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>The suppression of the Left in China<br />
  <small>(Part I)</small></h1>

  <h4>October 13, 1976</h4>

  <p>Unless reports about the mass arrests are fabricated and wholly untrue, we are
  witnessing a terrifying effort to turn the clock of history back in China. It is a sad
  day for the Chinese Revolution, for the workers and peasants above all, and it will
  certainly have worldwide repercussions of a detrimental character.</p>

  <p>The long-predicted process of "reversing correct verdicts" may have begun.</p>

  <p>The arrests of Chiang Ching, Chang Chun-chiao, Wang Hung-wen, and Yao Wen-yuan mean
  that Mao's closest supporters have been suppressed, and probably along with them
  thousands upon thousands of others will be affected.</p>

  <p>The elimination of these four from the leadership and their suppression mean that
  Mao's party is virtually being liquidated. No other conclusion can be drawn if it is
  true that Hua Kuo-feng and his supporters have resorted to these unprecedented forcible
  measures.</p>

  <p>Hua Kuo-feng himself may turn out to be an accidental and wholly transitional
  figure. It is the social forces behind him which are formidable and of consequence.</p>

  <p>It is also true that none of the four leaders &mdash; Chang Chun-chiao, Wang
  Hung-wen, Yao Wen-yuang, or even Chiang Ching &mdash; could have claimed the full
  political confidence of Mao. Unquestionably there were differences even among
  themselves. But as a political grouping, in reality as the core of the party, they were
  in Mao's camp and most fervently tried to carry out his program.</p>

  <p>The others were opposed to Mao and most strenuously opposed to the Cultural
  Revolution and its accomplishments. The removal of the photographs of the four party
  leaders from official places is an ominous sign. But the great cities of Shanghai,
  Canton, and Tientsin have not yet been heard from.</p>

  <h4>WARNING AT TIEN AN MEN</h4>

  <p>The destruction of the revolutionary left-wing in China, if that is what in effect
  is going on, would signify a major setback for the Chinese Revolution, the depth of
  which cannot at this moment be gauged.</p>

  <p>The very large Tien An Men demonstration last April after Chou En-lai's death was a
  storm signal of what lay ahead. In a certain sense it was the last possible warning
  that the rightist reaction was strong, with solid social support in the upper layers of
  Chinese society far beyond what the numbers at the demonstration indicated.</p>

  <p>In a way it was Kronstadt, 1921, revisited.</p>

  <p>It is to be remembered that it was the Kronstadt rebellion that sobered up the
  Bolshevik party and indicated what a great peril the revolution was facing from the
  right. It was then that Lenin, fully realizing the situation, proposed the New Economic
  Policy (NEP). It was a drastic change for the Soviet Union but it saved the revolution
  from what certainly would have been not merely a Thermidorian reaction but possibly a
  full-scale counter-revolution.</p>

  <p>Certainly no such drastic economic changes were needed in China more than 25 years
  after the revolution. And it is futile to engage in speculation now on what might have
  been the correct course for the revolutionary wing in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
  to pursue in the light of the ominous Tien An Men upheaval.</p>

  <p>But it is always a tremendous advantage to the revolutionary proletariat if, when
  faced with the necessity of taking a step backward in order to take two steps forward
  later, the revolutionary leadership itself can take the initiative and propose this
  course.</p>

  <p>This not only takes the steam out of the rightists, the opportunists, and
  revisionists, but it also saves the day for the revolution and strengthens it.</p>

  <p>When the revolutionary leadership itself directs such a step, this tends to counter
  any hardening of the opposing factions and limits the ability of the rightists to
  appeal directly to alien class elements &mdash; which in the era of the dictatorship of
  the proletariat are still formidable, especially in a huge country which is in the
  early stages of industrial development.</p>

  <p>When the revolutionary leaders take an early initiative and frankly and openly state
  the problem to the masses, buttressing their appeal with revolutionary propaganda aimed
  at the broadest audience possible, this prepares for the future and strengthens the
  proletarian dictatorship.</p>

  <p>Apparently this could not have been done in the days following Tien An Men.
  Certainly it was not done.</p>

  <p>It is entirely possible also that the shift to the right took place right there and
  then; that when Hua Kuo-feng became Prime Minister the shift was already an
  accomplished fact and the rightists were merely biding their time until Mao's
  death.</p>

  <h4>WANG SOUNDED THE ALARM</h4>

  <p>Apparently the shift to the right was fully recognized by Wang Hung-wen. An article
  in the <em>People's Daily</em> after the Tien An Men demonstration, widely attributed
  to Wang, sounded the alarm.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Uphold the Marxist principle of going against the tide and have the revolutionary
    spirit of five fearlessnesses. ... When confronted with issues that concern the line
    and the overall situation, a true Communist must act without any selfish
    consideration and dare to go against the tide, fearing neither removal from his post,
    expulsion from the party, imprisonment, divorce, nor the guillotine."
  </blockquote>The word guillotine is presumably a reference to the French Revolution,
  and in particular to the Thermidorian phase of the revolution. It is necessary to
  examine the concept of Thermidor in relation to the present situation in China not only
  because we believe it is already being raised by Wang but also because hasty and
  unwarranted generalizations could be drawn if the concept of Thermidor were equated
  with a full-scale counter-revolution.

  <h4>THERMIDOR: WHAT IT SIGNIFIES</h4>

  <p>Thermidor was the last stage of the French Revolution. It signified a deep-going
  reaction and the elimination of the revolutionary elements who had fought to continue
  and push the revolution forward.</p>

  <p>The French Revolution was a bourgeois revolution. The Jacobins, particularly the
  left Jacobins, tried to push the revolution beyond the limits necessary for the
  development of bourgeois society and of capitalist production. By going beyond the
  needs of the bourgeoisie, the Jacobins acted as a brake on capitalist development. But
  at the same time, the fact that they had pushed the revolution so far insured its
  survival against feudal reaction.</p>

  <p>The Thermidorians were the corrupt elements, the revisionists of their day, and
  their task was to sweep away the revolutionary elements. However, in the succeeding
  political regimes which followed the Thermidorian reaction there were alternately the
  dictatorial Napoleonic era, the restoration of the monarchy, and succeeding regimes of
  bourgeois democracy. But no regime, however severe the reaction, was able to
  reintroduce feudalism, which in the phrase of Engels was "cut root and branch."</p>

  <p>The Thermidorian reaction, therefore, historically signified <em>political</em>
  reaction but on the basis of the new, social system. It signified reaction within the
  framework of the new bourgeois society.</p>

  <h4>POLITICAL REACTION, BUT NO IPSO FACTO COUNTER-REVOLUTION</h4>

  <p>If a Thermidorian period of reaction is in the offing in China as a result of what
  apparently is an unprecedented assault on the revolutionary wing of the CCP, it would
  signify the triumph of political reaction over revolutionary progress. But it would be
  reaction on the basis of a workers' state, of a proletarian dictatorship.</p>

  <p>It would not automatically signify a full-scale bourgeois counter-revolution
  (against which Mao warned), even though the danger of one is inherent in any workers'
  state, even a very healthy one.</p>

  <p>It is most important to analyze the nature of the reaction so as to be fully armed
  in the struggle against it and so as not to confuse it with the full restoration of
  capitalism. This is a mistake which the Mao leadership has made in connection with the
  USSR and which has caused incalculable confusion and disorientation in the working
  class movement.</p>

  <p>It should be stated that the entire struggle in China which began with the Cultural
  Revolution and which has lasted for well over a decade constituted a heroic effort to
  avoid a Thermidor. We alluded to this in an article in our press. (See <em>Workers
  World,</em> March 3, 1967, "Mao Didn't Wait for Thermidor.")</p>

  <p>Indeed, the struggle of the revolutionary vs. the revisionist wing of the CCP has
  through all its trials and tribulations been one heroic effort to storm the heavens and
  to avoid the corrosive effects of social inequality and material aggrandizement which
  have become such conspicuous features of the Soviet Union (although it too is
  nonetheless still a workers' state).</p>

  <h4>MANY FORMS OF POLITICAL REACTION</h4>

  <p>It is important to recognize that there can be a variety of forms of political
  reaction on the social foundations of a workers' state such as in China or the USSR,
  just as it is possible to have a variety of forms of political reaction in a bourgeois
  social system. It is possible that the dictatorship of the proletariat can succumb to a
  strictly military form of rule where the army is in complete charge &mdash; as for
  instance could be the ease if the People's Liberation Army in China were to take over
  to the exclusion of civilian rule.</p>

  <p>All forms of political reaction on the basis of a workers' state erode its social
  foundations, however, and can open the door to a full-scale counter-revolution.
  Fortunately, no socialist country has yet succumbed to this, and none may.</p>

  <p>Bourgeois political reaction in a capitalist country has often gone hand in hand
  with rapid economic development. The same does not necessarily apply to political
  reaction in a workers' state.</p>

  <p>Capitalism develops spontaneously. Forms of capitalist rule may change from
  bourgeois democracy to monarchy to military dictatorship or even theocracy. Under all
  of them, capitalism continues to exist. Even when it declines most catastrophically, it
  falls back to a lower level of capitalist production.</p>

  <h4>SOCIALIST DEVELOPMENT NOT SPONTANEOUS</h4>

  <p>It is otherwise in a workers' state. Socialism cannot develop spontaneously. It must
  be built consciously on the basis of a planned economy, on the basis of the collective
  ownership of the means of production and pursuant to some plan of economic and social
  development.</p>

  <p>Without a party in power oriented in that direction, without a party geared and
  rooted in the ownership of the means of production and collectivization of land,
  degeneration back to capitalism is inevitable. Most likely this would be preceded by a
  violent struggle.</p>

  <p>While it is necessary to raise the question of Thermidorian reaction in the light of
  the assault on the revolutionary left in China, in order to avoid political and
  theoretical confusion, it is exceptionally important to also see the possibilities
  inherent in the Chinese Revolution for a rejuvenation and victory of the revolutionary
  elements. This is in reality wholly in accord with historical development.</p>

  <p>Only one aspect of the situation has thus far been revealed. The masses, however,
  have not yet spoken. True, their intervention cannot be evoked by mere exhortation and
  their enthusiasm for struggle cannot be turned on or off like a faucet. However, their
  apparent silence at present may only be of a momentary character.</p>

  <p>For all we know at the present, the battle has scarcely been joined. It still rages
  at the summits of political authority and may not yet have reached down below.</p>
