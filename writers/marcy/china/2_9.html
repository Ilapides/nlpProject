  <h1>Behind the Test Ban Negotiations &mdash;<br />
  and the Position of the People's Republic of China</h1>

  <h4>July 26, 1963</h4>

  <p>We are for a test ban. More than that, we are for completely banning and prohibiting
  the use and manufacture of all nuclear weapons and for the total destruction of
  existing stockpiles.</p>

  <p>But the people of the world must be made fully aware of the fact that the mere
  prohibition of certain types of nuclear testing does not at all mean a slowdown of the
  U.S. imperialist drive toward war.</p>

  <p>Even more so, the people must know that a partial or limited test ban of the type
  now being negotiated is cynically calculated by the U.S. to be of a military advantage
  to them at the expense of the socialist countries.</p>

  <h4>MASSES CLAMOR FOR PEACE!</h4>

  <p>The masses of people throughout the whole world are of course clamoring for peace.
  But imperialism, behind words of peace, continues to arm, visiting death and
  destruction wherever it can get away with it and prepares for nuclear war.</p>

  <p>A partial or limited banning of nuclear tests may come about as the result of an
  agreement coming out of the Moscow Conference between the U.S., Great Britain, and the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>Marxists will never deny the necessity or the permissibility of a socialist country
  entering into a concrete agreement with the imperialists on matters of disarmament.</p>

  <p>But it is one thing to execute a specific agreement with an imperialist power. It is
  another thing entirely to sow illusions about the peaceful intentions of imperialism
  and to deceive the masses about the aggressive character of imperialism and its
  congenital tendency towards militarism and war.</p>

  <p>History has shown that it is possible for belligerents to abandon the use of this or
  that particular weapon in a general war. Thus it was that during the Second World War
  poison gas was not used by any of the belligerents. That was due primarily to the fact
  that the advantages to either side mutually cancelled each other out.</p>

  <h4>WHO DROPPED BOMB AT HIROSHIMA?</h4>

  <p>If Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini &mdash; or for that matter the U.S. (who, after all,
  dropped the atomic bomb on the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) had entertained the
  slightest notion that they could have won the war or gained a substantial advantage by
  the use of poison gas, they would not have hesitated to use it. Certainly they had
  experimented with it and had large quantities of it.</p>

  <p>The presumed desire of the Kennedy Administration to ban nuclear weapons, starting
  with a limited ban on nuclear testing, is certainly not motivated by any humanitarian
  or peaceful considerations. To say anything of the sort is a fraud and a deception upon
  the masses. The motivation for the partial ban, if and when it is agreed upon in
  Moscow, arises from the fact that U.S. imperialists believe that it will give them a
  military advantage over other countries. A partial test ban does not mean that the U.S.
  will not continue to manufacture and stockpile more bombs. It already has 25,000
  warheads and merely seeks to stop testing certain types which are no longer militarily
  useful, at least for a while.</p>

  <p>Thus it is plain that it is a hardheaded offer based strictly on military advantage,
  and devoid of any kind of sentiment for peace.</p>

  <p>The primary political purpose of the maneuver of the Kennedy Administration is to
  bar the Chinese People's Republic from acquiring nuclear weapons for self-defense
  against U.S. imperialist aggression. It is merely trying to utilize the negotiations
  with the Soviet leaders as a ploy against China.</p>

  <h4>THE POSITION OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC</h4>

  <p>The Chinese People's Republic has made crystal-clear its position on nuclear war and
  the production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons. This it did only recently in an
  editorial in the July 19 issue of The Chinese People's Daily.</p>

  <p>This states that the "Chinese Government always stands opposed to nuclear war and
  has consistently advocated the total prohibition of nuclear weapons. We stand for a ban
  on the use, manufacture, stockpiling and testing of nuclear weapons and for the
  destruction of all existing weapons.</p>

  <p>A clearer and more forthright statement could scarcely be made. As anyone can
  plainly see, the Chinese are not only for banning tests and banning the manufacture of
  more bombs, but for the complete destruction of all existing nuclear weapons as well,
  and for their prohibition of manufacture and use in the future.</p>

  <p>All the Kennedy Administration has done is to offer to eliminate certain types of
  testing. Yet it is the Chinese who are maliciously and deliberately accused, day in and
  day out, of being for nuclear war.</p>

  <h4>NO CONSULTATION WITH CHINA</h4>

  <p>The Chinese Government, however, is not blind to the purpose of the current test ban
  negotiations on the part of the Kennedy Administration. The People's Government knows
  that it is aimed largely against China and as a "trap for the Soviet Union." The
  Kennedy Administration would like to see the Chinese People's Republic disarmed, and
  itself armed to the teeth.</p>

  <p>It was incorrect, to say the least, for the leadership of the USSR to begin any kind
  of negotiations on such critical issues, without full consultation and agreement with
  the Chinese People's Republic. In carrying on the negotiations with the U.S., while at
  the same time carrying out a campaign of vilification against the Chinese CP,
  Khrushchev has not only undermined the strength of the socialist countries and the
  international communist movement, but the Soviet Union itself.</p>

  <p>It is now plain that he has embarked upon a course that is most dangerous to the
  cause of world socialism and the destiny of mankind itself. No greater error can be
  made than to underestimate this danger.</p>
