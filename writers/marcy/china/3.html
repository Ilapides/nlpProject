  <h5>China 1977: End of the Revolutionary Mao Era [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>The suppression of the Left in China<br />
  <small>(Part III)</small></h1>

  <h4>October 26, 1976</h4>

  <p>The fall of Chiang Ching, Yao Wen-yuan, Chang Chun-chiao, and Wang Hung-wen marks
  the end of the Mao era in general and the end of the Cultural Revolution in particular.
  There might be minor turns of an episodic character in the ensuing period.</p>

  <p>Everything, of course, will be done under cover of Mao's name, and the employment of
  virtually the same terminological armor will continue. But there can be absolutely no
  doubt that what we are witnessing is the final triumph of the Thermidorian reaction
  over the Jacobin revolutionary dictatorship.</p>

  <p>Just as the Jacobin dictatorship enraged and terrified the possessing classes of
  both Europe and America, so did the Cultural Revolution bring down the wrath of all the
  forces of bourgeois reaction as well as of the ruling revisionist regimes in the
  socialist countries.</p>

  <p>Only when the Cultural Revolution was already in decline, only when Mao began a
  series of efforts at an accommodation with the U.S. and swung sharply and violently in
  an anti-Soviet direction, did the bourgeois publicists begin to take note of some of
  the accomplishments of the Cultural Revolution. Only then did they really begin to
  recognize People's China, without, of course, letting down in the least their
  relentless effort to favor the so-called moderates against the radicals, the rightists
  against the revolutionary left.</p>

  <p>There isn't an easily definable line of demarcation between the right and left in
  China and much of the struggle may have been obscured by the nature of the controversy
  itself, and by the fact that individual leaders, as is often the case, go from one camp
  to another. But there is absolutely no question that there have been, for many years,
  and certainly from the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, two lines of struggle
  represented by two divergent political groupings. The battle has raged over a period of
  more than a decade, the lines have gone through a series of changes, but now in the end
  the rightist camp has triumphed.</p>

  <h4>"LAW AND ORDER" GROUP HAS WON OUT</h4>

  <p>The "law and order" group is now in authority. It clearly stands for "stability," an
  end to experimentation with mass struggle, an end to evoking and involving the masses
  as the fundamental lever in the social evolution lifting China from poverty and
  backwardness into the socialist future.</p>

  <p>The Cultural Revolution was the high point of the Chinese Revolution, its
  distinctive feature &mdash; that is, the feature which distinguishes it from the
  socialist transformations in other countries since the Second World War.</p>

  <p>The suppression of the left, that is, of Chiang, Wang, Yuan, and Chang, marks the
  end of a ten-year-old struggle to avoid the so-called Soviet model. In the context of a
  vast and industrially underdeveloped country, it may have proved unavoidable. This is
  the true significance of the final denouement, the ouster of those now referred to as
  the "gang of four."</p>

  <p>In our previous articles we have characterized the Cultural Revolution as an attempt
  to thrust back the forces of neo-bourgeois restoration and as a heroic attempt to storm
  the heavens in advancing and promoting the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship
  of the proletariat.</p>

  <h4>PRIVATE PROPERTY VS. THE COMMUNES</h4>

  <p>The very first attempt, the very first shot fired to hurl back the forces of
  political and social reaction came in the form of a now famous literary criticism of a
  play, "The Dismissal of Hai Jui," on Nov. 10,1965, in the Shanghai newspaper Wen Hui
  Pao. Not accidentally, the criticism was written by Yao Wen-yuan. In it he went far
  beyond mere literary criticism and made the following political point:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "China, as everyone knows, ran unto temporary economic difficulties caused by three
    successive years of natural calamities. The imperialists, the reactionaries of
    various countries, and the modern revisionists launched wave after wave of attacks on
    us, and it was at this time that evil people in China started clamoring for
    'individual farming.' ... They played up the 'superiority' of 'individual farming'
    and called for the restoration of a private economy and the 'return of the land.' In
    other words, they wanted to demolish the people's communes. ..."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Leaving aside polemical exaggerations here and there, this is the basic issue that
  runs like a red thread throughout the entire ensuing period and through all the stages
  of the Cultural Revolution to the present day.</p>

  <p>When, for instance, the new Constitution of the People's Republic of China was
  adopted in January 1975, key provisions (contained in Articles VII and IX of the
  Constitution) were clearly victories for the rightists and a partial confirmation of
  the charge made by Yao almost ten years ago.</p>

  <h4>CHANGES IN 1975 CONSTITUTION</h4>

  <p>These provisions, which were of course endorsed and approved by the National
  People's Congress, affirmed, among other things, the right of the peasants to farm
  private plots. They also endorsed so-called side line production and vigorously
  approved the so-called principle of income distribution &mdash; to each according to
  his or her work, that is, abiding by bourgeois norms of distribution. Finally, they
  guaranteed to all citizens the right of private ownership of personal possessions (but
  not of the means of production).</p>

  <p>These provisions in and of themselves do not signify retrogression in a workers'
  state. It is very important to understand this. Under certain conditions they could
  even operate as a healthy temporary spur to economic development and alleviate the
  general conditions of the workers, the peasants, and the mass of the population.
  Lenin's New Economic Policy, for example, was a much more drastic change than these
  relatively mild provisions. But Lenin frankly and bluntly explained the NEP was a step
  backward. He called things by their right names.</p>

  <p>However, in China the incorporation of the above provisions in the Constitution by a
  triumphant rightist majority under conditions of a fierce factional struggle against
  the left invest them with exceptional significance. They were clearly intended as a
  thrust at the revolutionary innovations of the Cultural Revolution and as an attempt to
  turn the clock of history back, to reinvigorate the chase after material incentives,
  sanctify the growth of bureaucratic privilege, heighten the standing of the managerial
  elite, and enliven the growth of neo-bourgeois elements.</p>

  <p>It is not to be forgotten that this period marked not merely the reemergence of Teng
  Hsiao-ping, but his virtual assumption of the powers normally exercised by Chou En-lai,
  who unquestionably pushed Teng forward as his own health began to fade rapidly.</p>

  <p>It is precisely for the above reasons that Mao demonstratively stayed away from the
  January 1975 meetings of the Central Committee and the Fourth National People's
  Congress.</p>

  <p>In retrospect his de facto boycott of these meetings was indicative of the fact that
  the Maoist supporters were clearly in the minority and that the rightists were in fact
  trying to reverse earlier "correct verdicts."</p>

  <h4>MAO AND THE LEFTISTS</h4>

  <p>If there is any grain of truth at all in the report that Chairman Mao had warned his
  grouping of Chiang, Wang, Yao, and Chang against forming a faction, as is alleged in an
  editorial in the <em>People's Daily of Oct. 25, it could only be because he felt that
  the left was vastly outnumbered and weakened. There had been all the "rehabilitations"
  of right-wing figures and their reemergence under the aegis of Teng's leadership as
  well as the campaign of "rectifications" which was directed against the left and
  inspired by Teng.</em></p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the struggle that was actually launched against Teng was clearly led
  by Mao and carried out by his close supporters &mdash; Chiang, Wang, Yao, and Chang. It
  is they who, unquestionably under Mao's direction, initiated the campaign to "beat back
  the right deviationist wind which," as they said, "seeks to reverse correct
  verdicts."</p>

  <p>It was they who were responsible for a highly authoritative article reflecting
  their, and of course Mao's, view in the <em>Peking Review</em> of March 1976.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Around last summer," it said, referring to 1975, "a right-deviationist wind trying
    to reverse previous correct verdicts was whipped up in society at large. Its aim was
    to negate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by
    Chairman Mao ten years ago and the socialist new things that have emerged during the
    Cultural Revolution, to reverse the correct appraisal of the Cultural Revolution and
    practice revisionism. ... The bourgeois representatives who whipped up the
    right-deviationist wind to reverse correct verdicts were mainly those
    capitalist-roaders who were exposed and criticized during the Cultural Revolution but
    refused to mend their ways."
  </blockquote>

  <p>It can now clearly be seen against whom it was directed: Teng and his
  "rehabilitated" supporters as well as the whole right-wing.</p>

  <p>The only question that remains to be answered apropos the victory of the rightists
  at the Central Committee session and the NPC is how and why Mao had tolerated, if not
  acquiesced, in the rehabilitation and the reemergence with such vast political
  authority of Teng, admittedly an "unrepentant capitalist roader," as he had been
  called. Here again, it can only be explained by the erosion of revolutionary left
  support and the waning of Cultural Revolution enthusiasm in the popular masses. To this
  must be added, of course, the intractability and stubborn persistence of those social
  trends based on pre-existing broad social and economic conditions which are a
  continuing source for the sustenance of the rightist social grouping. The latter do not
  yield in this period to mere continual purgations and least of all to exhortatory
  revolutionary polemics.</p>

  <h4>FROM CULTURAL REVOLUTION TO FALL OF LIN PIAO</h4>

  <p>The Cultural Revolution may be divided into stages, the first lasting from November
  1966 until the attempt to set up the Shanghai Commune.</p>

  <p>This phase probably marked the period when enthusiasm for the Cultural Revolution
  was at its height. The apparent inability to set up the Shanghai Commune on the basis
  originally conceived, that is, like the Paris Commune with its broad participation and
  conflicting tendencies, opened up a period of disillusionment. It was slow and gradual,
  but nevertheless discernible. All the same, the Cultural Revolution was still marching
  on.</p>

  <p>The next phase, however, ended in the fall of Lin Piao and his associates, and this
  properly marked the beginning of the Thermidorian ascendency.</p>

  <p>The revolutionary left &mdash; the Maoist grouping &mdash; was weakened tremendously
  by the fall of Lin Piao and his associates. Lin, after all, was one of the top leaders
  of the Cultural Revolution. His fall meant a split in the left wing of the party.</p>

  <p>This is a crucial point to bear in mind in what is happening now. The split was in
  Mao's grouping and could not but have delighted and emboldened the rightists.</p>

  <p>At the same time, it weakened the morale of the People's Liberation Army. Whatever
  one may say about Lin, he was no Peng Teh-huai, his predecessor as head of the PLA and
  a man identified the revisionists. It would take little to convince the rank and file
  on that point.</p>

  <h4>LIN INCIDENT USED AGAINST LEFT</h4>

  <p>The rightists thereafter used the Lin incident to discredit the left. It was one
  thing when members of the same left faction, like Wang Hung-wen, attacked Lin. It was
  another thing when Chou En-lai, in his report to the Tenth Congress, pulled out all the
  stops in one of the basest attacks on Lin, accusing him not merely of an attempted coup
  and assassination of Mao, but of trying to restore capitalism, trying to install a
  feudal, compradore, fascist dictatorship, of capitulating to Soviet revisionism and
  social-imperialism, of allying himself with imperialism, etc., etc., ad nauseam.</p>

  <p>In reality, Chou with his enormous skill was deflecting the struggle onto the left
  wing at the Congress. It's hard to believe that his harsh rhetoric composed of amalgams
  of rightist and leftist charges was not deliberately calculated to undermine the
  left.</p>

  <p>Inevitably, the fall of Lin was followed by the reemergence of some of the rightist
  figures and attempts at "rectification" to undo aspects of the Cultural Revolution were
  begun. Soon this took on formidable proportions.</p>

  <p>But just as inevitably, the counter-attack on the rightists was also in full swing
  under what certainly must now be considered a fruitless campaign against Confucius and
  Lin. This was really directed against the rightists &mdash; but the rightists also used
  it to undercut the Maoist supporters with whom Lin was, after all, long associated,
  having been a top leader in the Cultural Revolution.</p>

  <h4>LEFT LOSES SUPPORT OF PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY</h4>

  <p>It seems that from then on, the People's Liberation Army could not be counted on to
  come to the aid of the Maoists against the right. If, as we raised earlier but which we
  strongly doubt, Mao warned his close supporters Chiang, Wang, Yao, and Chang against
  opening an attack, it was because he well knew also that they could not succeed because
  the PLA was no longer an ally as it was in the early Maoist struggle for the Cultural
  Revolution.</p>

  <p>In the final analysis, it was the PLA's role in the Cultural Revolution which made
  its triumph possible. Without the PLA, the victory of the right was inevitable.</p>

  <p>The PLA has never been just a military force. It has always been a political force,
  an instrument for the preservation of the proletarian revolution, and a pillar of the
  dictatorship of the proletariat, but not necessarily allied with the Maoists.</p>

  <h4>LAST CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE RIGHT</h4>

  <p>The campaign launched by Mao's supporters to beat back the "right deviationist wind"
  in early 1976 enabled the Maoist grouping to hold on to the trappings of office, and
  provided a cover for their seemingly remaining in power &mdash; but in reality power
  was no longer in their hands.</p>

  <p>The death of Chou En-lai seemed to have completely shifted power to the rightists.
  But in the light of the fact that Mao was still alive, the Teng-rightist forces either
  overreacted, that is, acted too rapidly, or were overconfident and had completely
  discounted the ability of Mao to launch one more campaign directed at them.</p>

  <p>But the success of the campaign against Teng, and especially against the rightists
  as a whole, was illusory, even with Teng's ouster.</p>

  <p>The death of Mao really returned the situation to the status of January 1975. What
  abruptly put an end to the apparent dominance of the Mao forces was the reactionary
  Tien An Men demonstration, which more than anything else showed how isolated the left
  had become. Nevertheless, they thought they were able to rally the people's militia
  behind them. But that, too, proved to be an illusion.</p>

  <h4>WHAT LIES AHEAD</h4>

  <p>What now?</p>

  <p>The Cultural Revolution was an unsettling element for all the possessing classes in
  contemporary capitalist society, and appeared as a danger to the peaceful
  accommodationist ruling groups in the socialist countries. At bottom they all hated the
  Cultural Revolution, although some, of course, had to pay homage to it. Its passing is
  regarded by them as a favorable omen. With it China has now entered fully into
  "respectable society." Now it is seemingly "acceptable," assuming, of course, that
  imperialism ever really accepts the existence of a socialist country.</p>

  <p>The reactionary foreign policy fearers of Maoist ideology, especially in the last
  couple of years with the utterly unwarranted attacks on Angola and Cuba, not to mention
  the USSR, have obscured the monumental revolutionary domestic achievements of the
  Cultural Revolution.</p>

  <p>Now that the rewriting of history by the new Hua regime has begun, as can be seen
  with the vilification of Mao's closest supporters, it is more than ever necessary to
  bear in mind that while the reaction has triumphed, it is strictly Thermidorian in
  character &mdash; that is, within the framework and on the social foundations of the
  new class power, in this case, of a workers' state. Both revolutionary revival as well
  as further regression are possible.</p>

  <p>But a social counter-revolution, that is, a full-scale counterrevolution which would
  entail the restoration of a possessing class, is totally excluded for the coming
  period.</p>
