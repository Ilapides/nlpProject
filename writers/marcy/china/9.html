  <h1>In Defense of the Chinese Revolution</h1>

  <h3>The record of Workers World Party</h3>

  <h4>September 17, 1976</h4>

  <p><em>By Deirdre Griswold</em></p>

  <p>In the 27 years since the victory of the revolution on the Chinese mainland, Workers
  World has been unique in both consistently defending the essentially socialist
  character of the revolution and in providing a profoundly Marxist explanation of its
  successes and reverses. Even before the formal launching of Workers World Party in
  1959, the leaders of our party-to-be saw in the Chinese Revolution the greatest social
  upheaval since 1917, when the Russian Revolution had for the first time put the
  proletariat in power.</p>

  <p>In a document on "The Global Class War," published in September 1950, Sam Marcy,
  future chairman and theoretical leader of Workers World Party, was the first defender
  of the revolution to explain that it was, in essence, a "dictatorship of the
  proletariat," although "not chemically pure, as no social formation ever is."</p>

  <p>This position was put forward by no other political tendency known to us at that
  time, including the Chinese Communist leadership themselves. Of course, the proletariat
  was then very weak numerically in China, and the revolutionary workers' state was not
  able to carry out many of the socialist tasks of the revolution at the beginning. But
  even though the leaders of People's China themselves referred to their state as
  representing a "peoples democracy" and a "democratic dictatorship," this only masked
  the fact that one class, the proletariat, was dominant, and that only proletarian
  revolution with the expropriation of private property and the introduction of socialist
  planning could move China forward out of centuries of oppression and backwardness.</p>

  <p>While this fact was debated by the entire left, it was quickly grasped by world
  imperialism. In less than a year, a war had been launched in Korea that arrayed the
  forces of world imperialism, led by the U.S., against the combined strength of the
  Korean people and the entire socialist camp &mdash; led by China and the USSR. Its
  objective was to turn back the socialist revolution sweeping Asia, and the ferocity of
  the imperialist onslaught confirmed the character of that revolution.</p>

  <h4>"HAIL THE COMMUNES"</h4>

  <p>The founding of Workers World Party in 1959 signified the emergence of a tendency in
  the U.S. that championed <strong>all</strong> the socialist countries, seeking through
  its press to educate the most advanced elements here on the earthshaking changes being
  wrought in that part of the world that had seemed to be mired in social stagnation. In
  the very first issue of this newspaper (March 1959), a front-page article hailed the
  Chinese communes, which were being treated as utopian by many on the left. Workers
  World saw the communes not only as a higher stage of production in agriculture, but as
  an expression of the revolutionary determination of the youth, of women, of students
  and political cadre, to thoroughly reorganize life in China on a collective basis, in
  the process overthrowing the old oppressive institutions and social relations based on
  private property.</p>

  <p>To combat ideologically the anticommunism of the U.S. imperialist ruling class and
  help the workers and oppressed here understand their identity of interests with the
  revolutionary currents in the world &mdash; such has always been a cornerstone of the
  purpose of Workers World Party. Of course, in order to best defend the overall
  interests of our class camp, that is, in order to be most <strong>partisan</strong> to
  the cause of the world proletarian revolution, it is necessary to maintain the kind of
  political independence that enables revolutionaries to speak up if they see that cause
  being damaged by the policies of leaders of socialist countries subject to the
  tremendous pressures of hostile imperialism.</p>

  <h4>SUPPORT IN DIFFICULT TIMES</h4>

  <p>While Workers World Party has always maintained such independence, this has not
  prevented it from being the most enthusiastic fighter for the Chinese Revolution,
  especially in those Years when the masses in China were sweeping away one entrenched
  institution of class society after another, and when China's international policies
  were more and more providing a rallying point for the world working class and the
  liberation movements in the struggle against imperialism.</p>

  <p>In the early sixties, there was no organized "Maoist movement" in the world. China
  was under constant ideological attack by imperialism, and increasing military pressure
  on its borders, too.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois press then created an image of the USSR and China almost the opposite
  of what they convey today. Chinese society was "dogmatic," "totalitarian,"
  "xenophobic." Khrushchev's openings to the West, his meeting with Eisenhower at Camp
  David, his advocacy of "peaceful coexistence" were all viewed in the camp of
  imperialism as positive developments, and the Soviet leaders were increasingly
  characterized as "imaginative," "flexible," and "realistic."</p>

  <p>People's China was extremely hard-pressed and isolated on the issues of Tibet and
  the border war with India. Workers World Party stood virtually alone in this country in
  its defense of China on these questions. In retrospect, they may not seem difficult
  issues. Now it is known that the CIA had a special campaign to promote
  counterrevolution in Tibet through the Dalai Lama, and a Tibetan colony under the
  protection of the U.S. Air Force exists in Colorado today, a legacy of that period.</p>

  <p>And by now several books have been written to show that China was fighting a
  defensive war against India in a struggle largely orchestrated by U.S. imperialism. But
  at that time the bourgeois opinion-makers depicted China as a monstrous aggressor
  hungry to dominate the entire Indian subcontinent, and it took a thoroughly
  revolutionary, internationalist party in this country to expose this as a lie.</p>

  <p>The origins of the Sino-Soviet split must be seen in the context of a world in which
  the leaders of the Soviet Union were courting the U.S. imperialists, who in turn showed
  an unbending hostility to People's China. And it was a world in which rising
  revolutionary movements &mdash; in Vietnam, in the Congo, in Cuba &mdash; were seeking
  not accommodation with imperialism, but liberation from its oppressive coils.</p>

  <p>With the publication in late 1962 of the article, "The Differences Between Comrade
  Togliatti and Us" by the Chinese Communist Party (reprinted in the U. S. in pamphlet
  form by WWP), the Chinese party began a polemical attack on the policies of revisionism
  and class collaboration practiced not only by the Italian CP, but also by the leaders
  of the Soviet Union. On Jan. 25, 1963, <em>Workers World</em> newspaper called for
  "firm support to the Chinese CP" in the polemic and explained, "Marxism-Leninism is the
  doctrine of the prosecution of the revolutionary class struggle in the interest of the
  victory of the world socialist revolution. In its answer to Togliatti, the CCP states
  that 'he and other comrades are in reality substituting class collaboration for class
  struggle on a world scale (and) advocating a fusion of the capitalist and socialist
  systems.' "</p>

  <h4>THE TEST BAN TREATY: AN IMPERIALIST WEDGE</h4>

  <p>It was only six months later that U.S. imperialism achieved a significant victory in
  its efforts to inflame the differences between the Soviet and Chinese leaders, to push
  them beyond polemics onto a state-to-state collision course.</p>

  <p>This was the purpose of the nuclear test ban treaty of July 1963. Far from leading
  to any kind of move toward world disarmament, the U.S.-Soviet treaty was seen by U.S.
  imperialism as a way of freezing its military advantage over the socialist countries.
  Politically, it was a razor cut at the Sino-Soviet alliance. <em>Workers World</em>
  newspaper said at the time (July 26, 1963), "In carrying on the negotiations with the
  U.S., while at the same time carrying out a campaign of vilification against the
  Chinese CP, Khrushchev has not only undermined the strength of the socialist countries
  and the international communist movement, but the Soviet Union itself.</p>

  <p>"It is now plain that he has embarked upon a course that is most dangerous to the
  cause of world socialism and the destiny of mankind itself. No greater error can be
  made than to underestimate this danger."</p>

  <p>Workers World saw this pact &mdash; the test ban treaty with its implied U.S.-Soviet
  alliance against China &mdash; as a weighty link in the chain of events that led
  China's leaders to so drastically alter their stance toward the USSR, and eventually to
  seek their own alliance with Washington. <strong>The course of Sino-Soviet relations
  cannot be understood without taking into account the long and carefully planed efforts
  by the U.S. imperialist bourgeoisie to split the socialist camp.</strong></p>

  <h4>THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION</h4>

  <p>In all the great bourgeois revolutions, and in the first proletarian revolution in
  backward Russia, the period of intense forward motion was followed by a decline and a
  partial reaction. Marxists call such a period Thermidor, after the month during the
  French Revolution when the political reaction asserted itself, restored much of the old
  society, but was unable to overthrow the class foundations of the new bourgeois
  state.</p>

  <p>In China, this period of reaction was <strong>anticipated</strong> by the
  revolutionary leadership, who called on the masses to meet and defeat it with the Great
  Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Cultural Revolution was almost universally
  condemned at the time &mdash; first of all by the world bourgeoisie, who slandered it
  as "anarchy" and "chaos" &mdash; but also by the CPs lined up with the Soviet
  leadership and even by those tendencies who considered themselves to the "left" of the
  Communist parties.</p>

  <p>Workers World, however, hailed the Cultural Revolution as an "earnest effort" to
  bring into practice new, revolutionary socialist ideas, habits, and customs to conform
  to the socialist foundations of China. In a series of articles in <em>Workers
  World,</em> beginning Jan. 20, 1967, Sam Marcy explained that the Cultural Revolution
  was a genuinely leftist development that found inspiration in the first workers'
  government, the Paris Commune, and that it was responding to the rise of a
  restorationist element in China that had become so strong within the party and in the
  positions of authority that a situation of dual power had been created.</p>

  <p>Workers World Party supported the momentous effort of the leftists &mdash;
  particularly the Red Guards and units of the People's Liberation Army &mdash; under the
  leadership of Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Defense Minister Lin Piao to rouse the masses
  in this struggle against reaction and bourgeois restoration.</p>

  <p>It was at this very moment in history that the leaders in the Soviet Union took
  another step fatal to the revival of Sino-Soviet collaboration. While visiting Britain
  in February 1967, that is, while in the capital of an imperialist country, Premier
  Kosygin told the press, "We are aware there are today in China, in the Communist Party
  in China, and in the Chinese government, people who are struggling against the
  dictatorial regime of Mao Tse-tung. We sympathize with them. ..."</p>

  <p>This counter-revolutionary attack on the leadership of the Chinese Revolution was
  made in a period when the USSR, not China, had made an accommodation with the U.S. It
  was followed by yet another blow against People's China: an agreement in 1968 between
  Washington and Moscow preventing the "proliferation" of nuclear weapons to their allies
  &mdash; an agreement that it is obvious today the U.S. never intended to keep, since it
  has provided Israel, Taiwan, south Korea, and others with nuclear capabilities.</p>

  <p>The tremendous heightening of tensions that followed these events led ultimately to
  an actual military clash along the Sino-Soviet border &mdash; a disastrous development
  not only for these two socialist countries, but for the solidarity and consciousness of
  the world proletariat and the oppressed nations.</p>

  <h4>THE BORDER DISPUTE</h4>

  <p>While the parties that were lined up with either the Soviet or Chinese leaders at
  that time took sides on the border dispute, Workers World called for a peaceful
  solution of the conflict. In an editorial on March 20, 1969, we said, "The continuation
  of the border conflict between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China can
  serve no useful, genuinely progressive purpose. If it is not terminated soon, it will
  divert the struggle against imperialism, confuse large masses of progressive people
  everywhere, diminish the political consciousness of the working people, and inflict
  untold damage on the cause of world socialism."</p>

  <p>This position did not ignore the role that Soviet revisionist policies had played in
  provoking the border clash. "The fundamental responsibility for the border clash rests
  ... on the Soviet leaders," we said. But we believed that the Chinese Communist Party,
  as the party that had been "the standard bearer for the revolutionary cause," had "the
  duty to the world movement to see to it that the border conflict does not divert the
  main revolutionary struggle against imperialism."</p>

  <p>The border dispute did not turn into the all-out war between the Soviet Union and
  China that the bourgeoisie so hoped for, predicted, and incited. But it did raise the
  spectre of such a war on both sides and gave impetus to those elements in China who had
  been characterizing the Soviet Union as "social-imperialist." It had only been a year
  earlier that Peking Review had for the first tome declared that capitalism had been
  restored in the Soviet Union. Even then, it had run it alongside a quote from Mao
  Tse-tung advising that "the masses of the Soviet people and of Party members and cadres
  are good, that they desire revolution and that revisionism will not last long."</p>

  <h4>"SOCIAL-IMPERIALISM"</h4>

  <p>This optimism, which belied any <strong>serious</strong> assertion that there had
  been a thorough-going bourgeois counter-revolution in the USSR, did not survive the
  "non-proliferation" treaty or the border clash.</p>

  <p>The label "social-imperialist" was used for the first time by Premier Chou En-lai to
  describe the USSR immediately after the Warsaw Pact intervention into Czechoslovakia in
  1968. Yet this move by the USSR to prevent a bourgeois restoration in Czechoslovakia,
  no matter that it was done by a revisionist bureaucracy, was no different in essence
  than the Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956 &mdash; a move that had been supported
  at the time by the Chinese leaders.</p>

  <p>This new class characterization of the Soviet Union by the Chinese CP, arrived at
  not because of any fundamental change that had taken place in the USSR but because of
  the increasingly hostile relations between these two great socialist countries, opened
  the door to a U.S.-China rapprochement. If the Soviet Union were now
  "social-imperialist," then the question of an alliance with one imperialist against the
  other was only a matter of tactics, not principle. And if the Soviet Union were
  "fascist," a term that began to appear in the Chinese press, then it might even be
  <strong>preferable</strong> to have an alliance with U.S. imperialism!</p>

  <p>Yet even this logic did not cushion the shock for many loyal followers of China's
  line when, in the early summer of 1971, it was announced that Nixon had been invited to
  China. For China had attracted behind its banners many who wanted the most to fight
  U.S. imperialism and who hoped that a new international alliance of revolutionaries
  could be forged. This was the height of the war in Indochina, and U.S. imperialism was
  passionately hated around the world. Every day the living images were there to see:
  children burned with napalm and phosphorus; villages razed to the ground; bomb craters
  stretching to the horizon.</p>

  <p>Nixon personified U.S. imperialism, and the question on every politically conscious
  person's mind was: Why did China do it?</p>

  <p>Workers World Party had been prepared for this painful turn of events much earlier.
  At the 1966 Labor Day Conference of the Party in New York City, Comrade Sam Marcy had
  raised the possibility: "If the ideological struggle between the Chinese party and the
  Soviet revisionists deepens and becomes a struggle between states, then it is possible
  that People's China may make a pact with the U.S. against the USSR."</p>

  <p>Then, as in 1971, our party did not oppose the right of a socialist country to
  conclude a pact or treaty with an imperialist nation. But there was more involved in
  the Nixon visit than a mere "normalization of relations" between the two states. What
  it signified was a broad agreement between the U.S. and People's China &mdash;
  undertaken at a time when U.S. imperialism was intensifying its bombing against the
  Vietnamese people. As we said on July 30, 1971, "The irresistible conclusion is that
  the Nixon invitation is a setback to the revolutionary movement."</p>

  <p>But in analyzing why China did it, Comrade Sam Marcy wrote that it could not "be
  explained solely as a response to Soviet revisionist policy." Comparing this turn to
  that made by the Soviet party in the twenties, alter the failure of important
  revolutionary struggles in Europe, he pointed out that the crushing defeat to the
  progressive forces in Indonesia in 1965, plus the inability of the Chinese party to win
  to its side in the struggle against Soviet revisionism any large and influential
  communist parties, were key factors in China's retreat to a "national" brand of
  socialism &mdash; where it perceived its own national interests in a way that
  subordinated the interests of the international revolutionary movement.</p>

  <h4>THE FALL OF LIN PIAO</h4>

  <p>The tragic end of Lin Piao, former Defense Minister and successor to Mao according
  to the Chinese Constitution, and the disappearance of his associates marked the end of
  an entire stage of the Chinese Revolution. In two wide-ranging articles in this paper
  on "The Cultural Revolution and the Fall of Lin Piao," Sam Marcy reviewed the lessons
  derived by Marxists from earlier great social revolutions. He showed how applicable
  were the writings of Engels on this subject to the course of events in China.</p>

  <p>Speaking of modern bourgeois revolutions, Engels had noted that "after the first
  great success," the victorious class had become divided. "One half was pleased with
  what had been gained, the other wanted to go still further, and put forward new
  demands." But the radicals had been defeated in this. Nevertheless, said Engels, "the
  achievements of the first victory were only safeguarded by the second victory of the
  more radical party; this having been attained ... the radicals and their achievements
  vanished once more from the stage."</p>

  <p>This was the achievement of the Cultural Revolution, said Marcy, and of Lin Piao and
  the other "radicals" in China. "Their participation and leadership in the Cultural
  Revolution helped block capitalist restoration and to safeguard the new property
  relations established by the revolution."</p>

  <p>But there are also important differences between a proletarian revolution and the
  bourgeois revolutions, Comrade Marcy pointed out. A proletarian revolution "needs a
  revolutionary worldwide perspective for its further socialist development," while the
  bourgeois revolutions were nationalistic in character.</p>

  <p>"Peaceful coexistence and accommodation with the West is what Mao proposed as the
  new foreign policy," he wrote. "This is what the 'radical faction' ... rejected and
  opposed. They were vanquished as earlier opponents of peaceful accommodation with the
  West were vanquished in the long period following Lenin's death in the Soviet
  Union.</p>

  <p>"But the decay of the worldwide system of imperialism daily brings in its train
  economic, social, and political catastrophes for the masses as well as genocidal
  imperialist wars. This makes the worldwide proletarian revolution all the more
  imperative and inevitable, and peaceful accommodation with the West a reactionary
  utopia."</p>

  <h4>ANGOLA &mdash; AND THE FUTURE</h4>

  <p>In the four years since this was written, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos have succeeded
  in expelling the foreign imperialists and have embarked on the road of socialist
  reconstruction of their war-torn societies; Portugal's former colonies in Africa have
  defeated the combined efforts of the colonialists and their imperialist backers; and
  the capitalist world has entered a period of economic decline more prolonged and severe
  than any since the Great Depression.</p>

  <p>China's leaders in this period have found themselves in a blind alley with regard to
  international policy. This reached a critical point over the question of Angola. The
  false theory of "social-imperialism " and its application to southern Africa put the
  People's Republic of China in an antagonistic position to a genuine and most
  revolutionary struggle for national liberation led by the MPLA &mdash; in other words,
  in a position harmful not only to the world movement but also to the basic class
  interests of socialist China itself.</p>

  <p>The policies of China's leaders in recent years have led to their support of NATO
  and other reactionary bourgeois alliances to contain "Soviet social-imperialism" and to
  the sorry spectacle of a right-wing militarist like ex-Defense Secretary James
  Schlesinger being welcomed at Chairman Mao's funeral.</p>

  <p>Proletarian revolutionaries can only be saddened by and opposed to such harmful
  policies, and promote, in the words of Ho Chi Minh, the "restoration of unity among the
  fraternal parties on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, in
  a way which conforms to both reason and sentiment."</p>
