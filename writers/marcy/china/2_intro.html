  <h5>China and the Class War 1959-1972 [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <h5>Originally published as "China: The Struggle Within"</h5>

  <p>Like all really great social upheavals the Chinese Revolution has had more effect on
  human history than upon human understanding. Only thirteen years ago in the United
  States this revolution was considered so esoteric a subject that outside the pages of
  Workers World, the only serious approach to it was in the lucubrations of bourgeois
  scholars and State Department "China experts."</p>

  <p>Even at the time of the communes and the "Great Leap Forward" (1958), there was
  little response in this country to the Chinese renaissance. Beginning in about 1963 or
  1964, however, many years after the revolution of 1949, a trend of super-supporters of
  People's China, or at least of the Chinese CP leadership, began to appear in the
  U.S.</p>

  <p>This trend not only gave Chairman Mao credit for being the sole and indispensable
  leader of the many millions who suffered and died between 1925 and 1949 to create the
  Chinese workers' state; it also followed uncritically every turn of Chairman Mao's
  political line &mdash; or what is said to be his line &mdash; in the foreign policy of
  the People's Republic.</p>

  <p>The trend has now split in two, with one section having discovered that People's
  China is "capitalist" with Mao the greatest of historical villains, and another section
  repeating the old adulatory phrases in the face of new and grim conditions that require
  the most careful evaluation by all genuine friends of People's China.</p>

  <p>This has helped to confuse and miseducate genuine revolutionaries &mdash; especially
  those trying to overcome a purely academic background and devote themselves to the
  revolutionary interests of the working class.</p>

  <p>The U.S. bourgeoisie, infinitely more class conscious than the U.S. working class
  and most of its political representatives at the time of the revolution (and now, too),
  did have great interest in the event, although the bourgeois that understood it best
  was very small indeed, and like Cassandra, was disbelieved and punished for making true
  predictions.</p>

  <p>This faction was ideologically led by Owen Lattimore, who was called the leading
  Soviet agent in the United States (by Senator Joseph McCarthy) for his pains. The
  Lattimore line was to recognize the Chinese CP leadership, but wean it away from Moscow
  in what was then called the "Mao Tse-Tito" approach.</p>

  <p>(Now President Nixon, who was a McCarthyite even before McCarthy, has adopted a
  modification of the Lattimore approach, but with a far more ruthless determination to
  destroy communism, both in China and the Soviet Union &mdash; and everywhere else.)</p>

  <p>The consistent record of understanding as well as defense of the Chinese revolution
  shown in the following pages should have an especial appeal for those who are serious
  about that revolution and who are determined to fight for its extension on the world
  arena.</p>

  <p>The present work consists of a series of articles that appeared in the pages of
  Workers World newspaper over the last 13 years. All of them are written by Sam Marcy,
  with the exception of some in 1971 and 1972 which are by Naomi Cohen and Deirdre
  Griswold, co-editors of Workers World. The articles are dated and the significance of
  the dates should not be lost on the reader.</p>

  <p>The pamphlet is not a critique of other political parties except in its implied
  comparison between their method and ours. But it does attempt a serious refutation of
  the bourgeois position and bourgeois theory on China. And even in condemning the
  Chinese invitation to Nixon and the recent Chou-Mao diplomacy, it shows the continuing
  validity of the Chinese Revolution.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the first article in the very first issue of Workers World
  (March, 1959) hailed the Chinese communes, which were then a new development, as a big
  shift to the left in the progress of People's China.</p>

  <p>While various tendencies described the communes as spurious or unworkable (Nikita
  Khrushchev was not to publicly declare them "ultra-left" until several years later), we
  hailed them unequivocally as a great advance of the revolution.</p>

  <p>In that first welcome to the communes, however, we also declared our differences
  with the comrades of the Chinese leadership. This leadership had not only given
  political support to the revisionist Khrushchev for the previous three years and
  endorsed Khrushchev's right-wing break with Stalin's line, but had followed the
  "co-existence" policy announced at the Bandung Conference of 1955, not to be repudiated
  until about 1961 during the dispute with the Soviet leaders. (The "co-existence" line
  of that time included the "non-interference in internal affairs" of countries with
  different social systems &mdash; meaning non-support to the revolutionary forces in the
  capitalist countries.)</p>

  <p>In the articles, as in our activities, we have generally shown understanding and
  sympathy with the Chinese leadership, and at all times we have defended People's China
  itself, unconditionally, against the imperialist world.</p>

  <p>We have supported the leftist trends and the revolutionary accomplishments of the
  leadership more vigorously and more loyally than anybody. The articles on the Cultural
  Revolution in this pamphlet are especially unique in this respect. Other political
  parties attacked the Cultural Revolution, either openly or covertly. But we defended
  it. We regarded it as a struggle against capitalist restoration as well as against
  bureaucratism. And we did this in spite of having less concrete information about the
  actual factions in the Chinese CP than some of our opponents did. We were well aware of
  the bourgeois gossip about the factions, and also aware that not everything said in
  Peking Review was fully objective reporting about the situation. Nevertheless, we took
  the historically correct position that independently of all partisan commentary, this
  was a great victory for the world proletariat.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, we understood that the CIA-backed massacre of the Indonesian Communist
  Party and defeat of the Indonesian Revolution in 1965 would ultimately lead to a right
  turn in Chinese foreign policy and above all that the China-Soviet split would force
  the Chinese leadership toward an alliance with the U.S. &mdash; once the split was
  evident on the state and national level, as well as the ideological.</p>

  <p>We purposely did not put such a grim prediction into writing, but Comrade Marcy
  armed our party with this understanding in various speeches, beginning with the one at
  our 1966 Labor Day Conference in New York.</p>

  <p>Our credentials on the Chinese Revolution go back considerably farther than the
  first edition of our paper in 1959. As early as 1950 (before becoming an independent
  party), we insisted that People's China was in fact the "dictatorship of the
  proletariat," although "not chemically pure, as no social formation ever is."
  (<em>Global Class War,</em> September 1950, Sam Marcy.)</p>

  <p>We were called "Stalinists" and "Maoists" for taking this position &mdash; and the
  terms were not meant as compliments at that time. We had to struggle hard merely to
  maintain an ideological position, since the McCarthyite witch-hunt and the Korean War
  (which was itself a new phase of the Chinese Revolution and the U.S.
  counterrevolution), were just beginning at that time.</p>

  <p>The Chinese leaders themselves denied they were leading the dictatorship of the
  proletariat at that time and they wrote into their first constitution a guarantee of
  those capitalist property relations that still existed in certain factories and other
  enterprises, partly because they felt they had to cement their alliance with the
  "national bourgeoisie."</p>

  <p>Thus we had to resist attacks from the American "leftists" of those days, too, who
  were always ready and willing &mdash; if not able &mdash; to prove that China was
  capitalist. And this was more than two decades before the present renegade theories
  about China's "capitalism" were developed.</p>

  <p>It is to be hoped that the following articles, in spite of a lack of editorial
  notation on the historical context, etc., will contribute to the understanding of the
  real People's China and the real Chinese Revolution.</p>

  <p>It is also to be hoped that this pamphlet will help to popularize the genuine,
  independent Marxist method of analysis in this country and refute the sterile formalism
  that is passed off as Marxism in academic circles. While nothing can actually build the
  Marxist-Leninist party like the proletarian struggle itself, the sharpening of our
  theory in combination with that struggle will surely advance the cause of the authentic
  U.S. Marxist-Leninists &mdash; <strong>Workers World Party.</strong></p>
