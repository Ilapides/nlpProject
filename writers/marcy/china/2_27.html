  <h1>The Cultural Revolution<br />
  and the Fall of Lin Piao (Part 2)</h1>

  <h4>August 25, 1972</h4><em>By SAM MARCY</em>

  <h4>MISCONCEPTIONS OF CHINESE REVOLUTION</h4>

  <p>No social revolution has ever coincided with the conception entertained by the
  ideologists of its time or its leading participants. Probably the Russian Revolution
  comes closest to conceptions which were held by its principal leaders. So many
  misconceptions of the Chinese Revolution prevailed, that years after the triumph of the
  Revolution and the ouster of Chiang Kai-Shek, the class character of the Chinese
  Revolution was still shrouded in confusion.</p>

  <p>Just as the West European social democrats and the Mensheviks in Czarist Russia
  could not believe that a proletarian revolution was possible in a backward country
  overwhelmed by a huge preponderance of the peasantry and an ill-developed bourgeoisie,
  so Western scholars and Marxists to boot, went even further in the case of China and
  even denied that a proletarian revolution had taken place. They advanced substantially
  the same erroneous theories as their colleagues in the earlier era and compounded
  them.</p>

  <p>The long years in which the Chinese Red Army led by the CPC was conducting the
  struggle against the bourgeois-landlord regime of Chiang Kai-Shek was characterized as
  agrarian in its class nature. The CPC itself, regardless of its advocacy of
  Marxism-Leninism, they explained, was merely promoting an agrarian revolution. This
  view was particularly rampant in the United States and vigorously pushed by the liberal
  bourgeoisie, including some of the highest ranking State Department officials, not to
  speak of the influential liberal publicists such as Owen Lattimore and others.</p>

  <p>Some organizations which proclaimed themselves Marxists were particularly stubborn
  in promoting this view and even the CP leaders in this country, undoubtedly getting
  their cue from the Soviet leaders, while expressing solidarity with a fraternal party
  nonetheless conveyed the impression that they too, in a large measure, regarded it as
  basically an agrarian revolution successfully carried out. Whether this objectively
  reflected the arrogance implicit in the attitude of an imperialist ruling class toward
  a formerly colonial country, only history will be able to confirm. It is at least as
  likely that the reservations of the Western CP leaders, generally, reflected the fear
  of the Soviet bureaucracy of the consequences that a proletarian revolution in China
  would entail in the struggle for leadership over the Communist movement and of the
  world working class.</p>

  <p>As we have seen, the Chinese Revolution can be divided into two great phases. The
  first one &mdash; we are still using the words of Engels &mdash; "displaced one
  definite class rule by another" &mdash; in this case the ouster of the
  bourgeois-landlord class from power and the establishment of what was in essence a
  Proletarian Dictatorship. But this victorious revolution, like all previous victorious
  revolutions (at least in European history) became endangered by restorationist
  elements. What was needed historically, was a second, supplementary revolution, in
  order to fortify, consolidate, and safeguard the fundamental accomplishment of the
  first revolution, the new class dictatorship. Hence the Cultural Revolution. In the
  minds of its participants it might have been conceived as an entirely new revolution, a
  revolution which had far loftier objectives than the mere safeguarding and securing of
  new property relations which had already been won more than a decade ago. But the
  subjective desires of the participants and the objective historical result, while not
  completely at variance, certainly did not conform with reality as it has unfolded.</p>

  <h4>HISTORICAL PARALLELS</h4>

  <p>What was the historical mission of the Jacobin dictatorship? It was to clear the
  road for the rule of the French bourgeoisie. In France more than anywhere else,
  feudalism had been extinguished, cut root and branch, by the Revolution. Yet the
  bourgeoisie did not, until late in the nineteenth century, hold exclusive political
  power. It again and again fell back to sharing it with other class formations. Even
  more so in England. The bourgeoisie there never held undivided sway. "Even after the
  victory of 1832," says Engels, "the bourgeoisie left the landed aristocracy in almost
  exclusive possession of the leading government offices." It took Bismarck to unify
  Germany. He swept away the feudal obstructions to the development of German capitalism.
  He himself was, of course, a junker and it was the junker feudal landed aristocracy
  that dominated Germany. Indeed the German bourgeoisie did not rule directly until the
  Weimar Republic (after World War I).</p>

  <p>The basic reason why it is possible for the bourgeoisie to share power with segments
  of the older feudal classes such as the aristocracy, is, of course, that they are both
  possessing classes, both exploiting classes, and they share a common hostility to the
  exploited. Their interests, nevertheless, are antagonistic.</p>

  <p>This is equally well demonstrated by the Civil War in the United States. What was
  the historic mission of the North's struggle against the South? In order to arrive at a
  conclusion, we ought to view the entire period of the Civil War and Reconstruction as
  two phases, two great historical turning points, just as in the Chinese Revolution.
  What was the objective of the struggle? The Northern ruling class and the Southern
  ruling class, as we said, were both possessing, oppressing, and exploiting classes. But
  the North based itself in and had its origin and development in the modern capitalist
  mode of production which is based on the private ownership of the means of production
  and on wage labor. The Southern ruling class was also an exploiting, oppressing,
  possessing class no more avaricious than the Northern ruling class. It too based itself
  on the private ownership of the means of production but on <em>chattel (slave) labor,
  not on wage-labor.</em> Slavery in the U.S. was an integral part of the bourgeois mode
  of production in the system of commodity production. But whereas the North based itself
  on the modern capitalist industrial form of wage <em>exploitation</em> ( "free labor"
  ), the South was based wholly on slave labor. The two systems were economically
  incompatible. A struggle between them became inevitable because the slave system could
  not adequately compete with the wage system of exploitation and was doomed to
  destruction.</p>

  <p>In the minds of its progressive participants, the struggle was between "freedom and
  slavery." But the struggle of the Northern bourgeoisie against the slave-owning
  aristocracy was not out of any regard for freedom as such, but was pursued because the
  slave system of exploitation was inhibiting the expansion of the modern capitalist
  system of wage slavery, capitalist production, and accumulation. Four years of Civil
  War proved inadequate to firmly establish the capitalist wage system and the economic
  framework necessary for its functioning or to completely root out the remnants of
  chattel slavery which later took the form of a feudal type of peasant-landlord
  relationship on the land (peonage). This tended to reduce the mass of the emancipated
  slaves to second degree citizenship, devoid of the rights of emancipated wage labor in
  the North. The period in history known as Reconstruction was a great effort by the
  Radical Republicans to bring about full freedom ("free labor"), full political equality
  for all (all males). This was the second phase of the revolution. It was historically
  needed, not as it was conceived in the minds of many who participated in it, to bring
  about full political equality of all citizens, but merely to secure, as Engels would
  say, "safeguard, the achievements of the first revolution."</p>

  <p>The historic mission of the second revolution was to complete the destruction of
  chattel slavery, to destroy the power of the former slave owning aristocracy, and to
  safeguard the revolution against any restoration.</p>

  <p>Having achieved that, the conservative wing of the second revolution "was
  satisfied." The other wing, the Radical Republicans, which wanted to go further and
  bring about complete equality in political life, "vanished from the scene." Finally,
  the revolution ended in the shameless episode of the betrayal of 1877 which gave the
  Southern ruling class complete sway over the emancipated Black masses. The Southern
  ruling class was rearmed to protect its newly regained power. Full political rights to
  the Black masses, as the bourgeoisie saw it, was not necessary for the functioning of
  their capitalist industrial system of exploitation. The maintenance of the Black masses
  in a subjugated and politically expropriated status served the Northern ruling class'
  ability to expand capitalist accumulation but only in alliance and partnership with the
  Southern ruling class.</p>

  <p>As can be seen, the Northern capitalist class made an accommodation with the
  Southern ruling class with whom it shared power rather than to leave them powerless by
  a continuation of the revolutionary struggle. To this very day, Northern capitalists
  share power with their Southern colleagues because of, among other reasons, the
  compromise that they made a century ago which smoothed the way for capitalist expansion
  and accumulation and the ultimate conversion of the competitive stage of capitalism
  into monopoly capitalist imperialism. Therein lies the origin of the super-exploitation
  of the Black masses and the reason why the Northern bourgeoisie did not fully
  emancipate the Black people. Only a proletarian revolution can fully emancipate all the
  oppressed, Black and white.</p>

  <h4>SHARING OF POWER BETWEEN HOSTILE CLASSES</h4>

  <p>As we have seen, the bourgeoisie as a class has not always been able to rule
  exclusively without sharing power in a coalition with other classes or their
  representative factions. It has been able to rule exclusively only since the late
  nineteenth century. Only the North American bourgeoisie has held exclusive power
  &mdash; but only because feudalism was unknown on this continent. The settlers who
  ventured to the shores of the new world were not confronted with an entrenched feudal
  social order. How different it was with the establishment of the two great socialist
  states, the Soviet Union and China. In both countries, there was a huge preponderance
  of peasant masses, an ill-developed bourgeoisie which had not bequeathed the necessary
  industrial and technological framework to enable the proletariat to commence an easy
  transition to socialism. In both countries the legacy that the former possessing
  classes left was one of backwardness in industry, in technique, in education, and
  practically all fields of social development. Moreover, an imperialist bourgeoisie,
  which had survived numerous social catastrophes and attempted proletarian revolutions
  (in Europe at least), still dominated over the major portion of the human race. Its
  industrial, technological, and military power stood, and still stands, as the greatest
  threat to the socialist development of the USSR and China, other socialist countries,
  and the liberation movements.</p>

  <h4>BASIC HISTORICAL FACTORS BEHIND SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY REGRESSION</h4>

  <p>Almost a quarter of a century after the Chinese Revolution and more than half a
  century since the October Socialist Revolution, the factors of industrial backwardness,
  preponderance of a huge peasantry, and the strengthening and revival of the imperialist
  system after the Second World War are still the basic factors that account for the
  eagerness, particularly on the part of the Soviet and Chinese leadership, to make an
  accommodation with the imperialists and renounce revolutionary internationalism.</p>

  <p>There are those who see the regressive policy of both the Soviet Union and China as
  emanating almost exclusively from treachery and conspiracy. Others attribute it solely
  to mistakes in policy, the victory of reactionary over revolutionary leaders and the
  absence of proletarian democracy. Even taking all thus into account, these policies can
  only be understood in the light of the broader perspective of objective circumstances
  of which they undoubtedly are the result.</p>

  <p>However, if we view the problem in the light of half a century of experiences, and
  in the light of the earlier experience of the bourgeoisie in the struggle against
  opponent possessing classes, we see that at certain stages in its development, as a
  ruling class, they were forced at various times and under varying circumstances to
  share power with opponent possessing classes. We see now that it is also characteristic
  of proletarian dictatorships established in backward countries. The same tendency
  toward accommodation evidenced by the bourgeoisie before it attained full, exclusive
  political power is also common to the governing groups representing the socialist
  countries. There is however a fundamental difference between the objective historical
  result obtained by the bourgeoisie as against that obtained by the governing leadership
  in the USSR and China.</p>

  <p>The alliance that the bourgeoisie made with the older class formations, such as the
  landed aristocracy, had thus indubitable advantage which enabled it ultimately to
  conquer the feudal classes and take them completely in tow. The feudal system is a
  basically static system. The bourgeois system is dynamic. The bourgeoisie must
  constantly revolutionize its methods of production, speed development, improve
  technology, and adapt itself to the changing needs of the capitalist market. This is
  the law of life for the bourgeoisie. The development of the productive forces in the
  imperialist epoch is, of course, retarded if compared with what a social system will
  do, but within the framework of capitalist production, the bourgeoisie continues the
  pursuit, with breakneck speed; of the development of technology. The feudal classes
  were not only static but they based their existence, as Marx pointed out as early as
  the Communist Manifesto, on the preservation of the old methods of production.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie bases itself on constantly revolutionizing the method of production.
  The old mode of feudal production (or chattel slavery as it existed in the United
  States) having been destroyed, the bourgeoisie by the mere automatic processes of
  capitalist production and the blind forces of the market was ultimately able to reduce
  all previous social classes to its sway. Thus, elements of the landed aristocracy in
  Britain ultimately became Bourgeois industrialists. The bourgeoisie for a long time
  used a feudal monarchy and was able to convert it into a Bourgeois monarchy. And the
  former parties of the feudal classes were absorbed into the Bourgeois Political system
  and became bulwarks of reaction on behalf of the Bourgeois ruling class against
  revolutionary threats by the proletariat and oppressed peoples.</p>

  <h4>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOURGEOIS AND SOCIALIST SYSTEMS<br />
  <br /></h4>

  <p>The socialist system, at least in its initial formative stages, does not develop
  automatically; by its very nature it has to be consciously planned and organized. And
  in this respect it differs vitally from the bourgeois mode of production which is
  regulated by blind economic forces.</p>

  <p>Because the first two great socialist proletarian revolutions took place not in the
  industrialized capitalist countries, but in underdeveloped countries, they faced some
  of the same problems that the early bourgeoisie faced in its struggle as a nascent
  ruling class.</p>

  <p>Ever political upheaval at the summit of governmental leadership is a symptom of
  social disturbance below.</p>

  <p>An attempted coup, such as is attributed to Lin Piao, can only be a reflection of
  serious instability in the social and political relations between the basic classes in
  contemporary Chinese society.</p>

  <p>According to the official statement issued by the Chinese Embassy in Algiers on Lin
  Piao, the explanation for Lin Piao engaging in a plot to assassinate Chairman Mao and
  seize power through a coup can be understood in a large measure from (1) "his
  underhanded nature" (2) "he was a two-faced man" who in reality was opposed to the
  "revolutionary foreign policy of Mao," and (3) "did not change his perverse nature one
  iota."</p>

  <p>Acceptance of such an explanation for an enormous historical event does violence to
  history itself, especially if one examines the array of leaders involved.</p>

  <p>These include: Lin Piao, the Defense Minister, Politburo member and military leader
  since the early Thirties; Chen Po-ta, a member of the standing committee of the
  Politburo, a leader of the Cultural Revolution and for many years Mao's personal
  secretary; Huang Yung-sheng, former chief of the general staff of the armed forces; Wu
  Fa-hsien, commander of the air force; Li Tso-peng, deputy chief of staff and political
  commissar of the navy; Chiu Hui-tso, deputy chief of staff of the army and head of the
  logistics department; Yeh Chun, a member of the party Politburo and director of the
  administrative office of the party military affairs committee; and Lin Li-kuo, Lin's
  son who was deputy director of the air force operations department.</p>

  <p>Such a conception brings us back to pre-Marxist notions of history where good men
  and evil fought plots and counter plots and where the reign of the arbitrary was the
  supreme rule of history.</p>

  <p>But Marx's development of the materialist conception of history demonstrates
  conclusively that all political phenomena have a class base. It is especially true of
  political events of such enormous historical import as this elimination of an entire
  stratum of leadership. They not only were most prominent during the Cultural
  Revolution, but some of them spent their entire lifetime in the midst of the leadership
  of the CPC throughout the course of the Chinese Revolution.</p>

  <p>Lenin wrote on December 24, 1922, in one of his last letters, regarding "grave
  differences in our party" which might cause a split. He went on to say: "Our party
  relies on two classes (workers and peasants) and therefore its instability would be
  possible and its downfall inevitable if there were no agreement between those two
  classes. In that event this or that measure, and generally all talk about the stability
  of our C.C., would be futile. No measures of any kind could prevent a split in such a
  case. But I hope that this is too remote a future and too improbable an event to talk
  about."</p>

  <h4>COLLECTIVIZATION IN CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION</h4>

  <p>Lenin wrote this, of course, before collectivization in the Soviet Union took place.
  But even a collectivized peasantry is by no means a proletarian class. Collectivization
  sets the framework, and the socialist future depends on a multitude of factors in which
  a thoroughgoing industrialization and rationalization based on the most modern
  technique is most essential. The gap between rural life and life in the city is a great
  factor. It cannot be easily overcome even under the best of conditions.</p>

  <p>The political denouement of the Lin-Chen grouping is the objective result of the
  instability of class relations in China, following upon the heels of the Cultural
  Revolution. Of course, they are immeasurably more stable than the relations in any of
  the bourgeois countries. The political crisis resulting in the Lin-Chen ouster reflects
  the true dimensions of this instability, and of Chairman Mao's quest for a resolution
  of it by fundamental changes in the foreign policy.</p>

  <p>The extraordinary degree to which the Chinese peasantry was receptive to the
  revolutionary propaganda of the CPC and the PLA is often attributed solely to the
  tactics and strategy pursued by the leadership. This of course was very important and
  decisive.</p>

  <p>But what is often lost sight of are the objective conditions which enabled the
  masses to respond to a revolutionary call to arms from a Marxist-Leninist party.</p>

  <p>The Chinese peasantry, unlike peasants in Western Europe or in other semicolonial
  countries, had a great deal more in common with the Chinese proletariat. As Engels says
  in <em>The Peasant Wars in Germany,</em> concerning events more than four hundred years
  ago, "the German peasant of that time had this in common with the modern proletariat:
  that his share in products of the work was limited to a subsistence minimum necessary
  for his maintenance." (International Publishers, 1926)</p>

  <p>The protracted character of the Chinese revolution and the ruthless war upon the
  Chinese people conducted by the Japanese imperialists, which had caused such
  unspeakable havoc, economic dislocation, ruination and destruction of lives and
  property, reduced the bulk of the Chinese peasantry, not only to the level of
  subsistence of the Chinese proletariat, but way below it, making the peasant far more
  susceptible to the revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeois landlord regime.</p>

  <p>The dictatorship of the proletariat has the economic and political problem of how to
  share, not only the work of socialist construction, but the distribution of the income
  between the classes, the workers, the peasants and all intermediate strata of the
  population.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there is still the bourgeois intelligentsia, which, although shorn of its
  power, has not been destroyed but in the process of being reeducated, necessarily plays
  a key, if not central role in the economic, industrial, scientific and other phases of
  life.</p>

  <p>More than in any other socialist country, the gap between the privileged and the
  ordinary worker or peasant has been narrowed and material inequality reduced, certainly
  by comparison with the Soviet Union. But the social contradictions continue, and are
  exacerbated, among other things, by the ever increasing need of scientific and
  technological resources diverted for defense needs, which consume no small portion of
  the fruits of socialist construction.</p>

  <p>Collectivization in China has made truly remarkable accomplishments. This is
  accounted for particularly by the participation of the masses, and the enthusiasm it
  evoked in the course of such a radical transformation. It took place without pushing,
  in fact avoiding, the type of material incentives which break up the solidarity of the
  masses, which was the practice in the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the peasantry as a
  class is distinguished from the urban proletariat.</p>

  <p>Both China and the Soviet Union have had to resort to huge purchases of wheat from
  the imperialist countries. This is only one aspect of an internal contradiction in
  socialist countries which manifests itself in the form of some dependence on the West.
  Some of the more sophisticated technology developed in the capitalist countries is
  needed for socialist construction both in the USSR and in China. This is another aspect
  of dependency.</p>

  <p>Finally, the productive forces which are restricted by the character of having
  national states in the socialist bloc, with just bare economic ties between the
  countries, and lacking the necessary comradely economic cooperation, is another
  drawback. The socialist camp, economically speaking so far as China and the Soviet
  Union go, is merely a potential. Great power chauvinism shown by the Soviet leaders
  since the death of Lenin in relation to the other socialist countries has alienated
  them, forced each to seek its "own" road to socialist construction which, from the
  point of view of Marxism, is a reversion to anachronistic national self-sufficiency in
  the socialist camp.</p>

  <h4>COMECON AND SOCIALIST COOPERATION</h4>

  <p>Although the Soviet Union has somewhat relaxed its rigid dominant economic control
  over COMECON (which is the USSR's answer to the imperialist Common Market) in Eastern
  Europe, it is nothing like the necessary socialist cooperation between socialist
  countries which respect each other's sovereignty and are all pledged to socialist
  construction for the common good of all.</p>

  <p>Rumania is a classic example of a small socialist country that ordinarily has
  everything to gain by economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and other socialist
  countries in a common bloc or socialist federation. Ceaucescu's half-turn to the West
  can only be explained on the basis of the Soviet leaders' shabby treatment of the
  People's Republic of Rumania. What the Soviet Union tried to do or force upon Rumania
  was the kind of division of labor in COMECON which would leave Rumania underdeveloped,
  economically deformed, and an appendage to Soviet needs rather than on the basis of the
  common needs of all the socialist countries.</p>

  <p>The PRR has no fundamental political differences with the Soviet leaders and its
  overtures to the West are based strictly on economic considerations.</p>

  <h4>LIN PIAO CASE &mdash; FLOWS FROM COMBINATION OF HISTORICAL FORCES</h4>

  <p>These then are some of the fundamental factors that lie behind the latest phase of
  developments in both China and the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>The Lin Piao affair must be seen in that historical perspective, as China's and the
  Soviet Union's eagerness to make an accommodation, some sort of more or less stable
  detente, with the imperialist West at the expense of the Vietnamese people and the
  world revolution flows from the constellation of historical forces.</p>

  <p>Any number of erroneous conclusions can be drawn from this especially in this land
  of classic rabid anticommunism. In a recent issue of the New York Review of Books, the
  well-known liberal publicist I.F. Stone, writing about the capitulation of both China
  and the USSR on the Haiphong crisis, said "Brezhnev and Chou En-lai have become the
  running dogs of the U.S. imperialists." Certainly the conduct of the Chinese and Soviet
  leaders in the Haiphong crisis can evoke an easy protest and utter disgust. I. F. Stone
  is angry at the Nixon administration for its imperialist brinkmanship and is
  frustrated, as are millions of others throughout the world, that neither the Soviet nor
  the Chinese leaders should pick up the challenge (not necessarily in a nuclear
  confrontation). Stone's characterization of the leadership of China and the Soviet
  Union cannot however be taken for a serious appraisal. Stone will take comfort from his
  frustration in joining the McGovern campaign.</p>

  <p>Revolutionary Marxists cannot for long afford the luxury of pessimism. The need is
  to chart a course for the revolutionary struggle against imperialism based upon an
  accurate appraisal of the position and orientation of the Soviet and Chinese leaders as
  well as the domestic situation.</p>

  <h4>TWO TYPES OF ACCOMMODATION</h4>

  <p>The Soviet leaders (and the Chinese leaders to a lesser extent) have renounced the
  perspective of world revolution and have abandoned the liberation struggle. But by no
  means have they galloped into the arms of imperialist policy and stabilized their
  relations with the U.S. on the basis of carrying out Washington's orders.</p>

  <p>Such mistaken conclusions have been made with regard to the Soviet Union in the late
  thirties during the Stalin-Hitler pact period which swung an entire generation back
  into the camp of social democracy.</p>

  <p>Regardless of any and all attempts at accommodation, the two social systems &mdash;
  that of the imperialist system and the socialist system prevalent in the Soviet Union
  and China &mdash; are diametrically opposed to each other and are based on antagonistic
  class structures.</p>

  <p>Any accommodation, any secret arrangements that have been made can only be of a
  temporary character. They will, of course, hurt the world movement. They are not
  however like the accommodations and alliances made between the bourgeoisie and the
  feudal classes or between the North and the South in the United States. The
  accommodation made between those classes were viable accommodations because the
  bourgeoisie, by virtue of the automatic processes of capitalist production, was able to
  assimilate whatever class fragments of the feudal classes were left into the bourgeois
  order of society and actually strengthen the system against the exploited classes.
  There was a common denominator between those classes. They were both possessing,
  exploiting social formations and had a common hostility to the oppressed.</p>

  <p>It is otherwise with the socialist states. The class differences between them and
  the bourgeoisie are of an utterly irreconcilable character. Neither system can long
  endure, as Lenin so well said in 1921, without there being a funeral for one or the
  other. The fundamental basis for the revival of the capitalist system of exploitation,
  as particularly evidenced following the Second World War, lies in the fact that
  contrary to Marx's original prognosis, the socialist revolution came first not where
  conditions were most favorable for the development of socialist society, but where the
  imperialist system was weakest. The failure to overthrow the capitalist system in
  Western Europe, aside from fundamentally false policies, indicates that the task of
  proletarian revolution is an immeasurably more difficult one than had been conceived
  prior to World War I.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the imperialist system in the epoch of its general decline cannot
  go on without enormous economic crises, political catastrophes, counter-revolutionary
  coups, subversion of socialist countries, and the prosecution of imperialist wars. This
  alone makes the proletarian revolution necessary and inevitable.</p>
