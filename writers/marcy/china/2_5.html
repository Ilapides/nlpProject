  <h1>Facts Behind China-India Border Dispute</h1>

  <h4>October 26, 1962</h4>

  <p>If a general of the Chinese imperial government representing the Manchu dynasty had,
  by force of arms, pillage and plunder, succeeded in subjugating the North American
  continent and on that basis had artificially created a border line between the United
  States and Canada called, let us say, The Manchu Line, would a sovereign U.S.
  government abide by thus border line?</p>

  <p>Let us suppose further that the boundary line demarcated by this general included,
  for the Canadian side, parts of Buffalo, Detroit, Seattle and Duluth. Let us suppose
  again that the treaty between Canada and the U.S. dictated by this general had never
  been accepted by any government of the United States, and that in truth the people of
  the U.S. regarded this treaty and its boundary line as illegal, null and void, and as
  the imposition of a foreign power at a time when the U.S. was weak, divided and under
  the domination of a foreign imperialist power.</p>

  <p>All we have to do with this analogy is to just change the name &mdash; Canada to
  India, United States to China and China to Great Britain &mdash; and the picture
  becomes immeasurably clearer than it is represented in the U.S. press.</p>

  <h4>THE McMAHON LINE</h4>

  <p>It is the position of the Chinese People's Republic that the so-called McMahon Line
  &mdash; named after the British General McMahon &mdash; is illegal, null and void, and
  the result of a predatory, imperialist imposition of the British government in the year
  1914.</p>

  <p>No Chinese government ever accepted the McMahon Line. Neither did the Imperial
  Government of China in 1914, nor the Chiang Kai-Shek government ever agree to it. The
  very fact that even the Chiang Kai-Shek clique, which is nothing but a tool of U.S.
  imperialism, has not dared to dispute the Chinese People's Republic's position of the
  China-India border dispute, it in itself the most eloquent testimony to the correctness
  of the Chinese position.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the Chinese People's Republic has made every effort to achieve a
  reasonable and just settlement of the territory in dispute. It has consistently shunned
  the use of arms.</p>

  <h4>PROPOSALS FOR NEGOTIATIONS</h4>

  <p>Although the border dispute is almost three years old now, and the Chinese have made
  innumerable other approaches to the Indian government to settle it on some amicable and
  acceptable basis the Nehru government has invariably turned them down. In the past two
  months alone the Chinese government made several proposals for negotiations.</p>

  <p>It made a notable effort on August 4, and another one on September 13. In neither of
  these proposals did the Chinese government lay down any preconditions for the
  negotiations. Nor did the Chinese government resort to the type of language which could
  in any way be construed as a threat to India.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the diplomatic notes directed to the Indian government were couched
  in the most conciliatory language, and were calculated to effectuate a reasonable
  settlement which would safeguard the territorial integrity of China as well as
  India.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the London Times, certainly no friend of the Chinese
  revolutionary government, had to publicly admit on October 8 that if military
  operations were resumed on the Sino-Indian border, "onlookers will have to note that it
  was New Dehli . . , that declined to embark upon them (talks) . . ."</p>

  <p>The position of the London Times is of exceptional importance because it has always
  sided with India as against China. The London Times was obliged to make the above
  statement only after the Indian paper, Tribune, had reported that at a cabinet meeting
  the Indian government had decided to use armed force to deal with China.</p>

  <h4>NEHRU'S "LIMITED OFFENSIVE"</h4>

  <p>It was also reported in the world press on October 8, that Nehru had authorized
  India's new commander-in chief of the eastern border area to "fight a limited offensive
  operation."</p>

  <p>These are the incontrovertible facts.</p>

  <p>As to what lies behind the aggressive attitude of the Nehru government, it must be
  borne in mind first of all that the imperialist world, particularly the U.S. would like
  nothing better than to see the two principal Asiatic powers, the two powers which hold
  the greatest revolutionary promise for mankind in the east, locked in military combat,
  shedding the blood of thousands, absorbing the resources and energies of millions of
  people, which should be used to construct a revolutionary way of life.</p>

  <p>The efforts of the U.S. government, it must be noted, have been directed, insofar as
  India is concerned, not only to make it economically and financially dependent upon
  U.S. monopoly interests, but also to inflame the Indian bourgeoisie, particularly its
  right-wing extremist elements, against the Chinese People's Republic.</p>

  <h4>FOUR BILLION U.S. AID</h4>

  <p>According to The New York Times of October 22(1969), the U.S. has poured into India
  more than four billion dollars. A substantial section of this money has gone to line
  the pockets of Indian businessmen, government officials, and especially the extremist
  elements who are interested in diverting the mass discontent of the Indian peasants and
  workers into other channels.</p>

  <p>U.S. diplomats, State Department planners, and military figures in the Pentagon have
  for a long time felt that the biggest diversionary tactic that imperialism could employ
  to disrupt the revolutionary anti-imperialist front was to continually stir up, bribe
  and corrupt as many of the representatives of the Indian bourgeoisie as it could to fan
  the flames of an India-China war.</p>

  <p>Nehru himself was subjected to unremitting pressure when he was in the U.S. More
  U.S. aid was used as bait to lure Nehru into the trap of a protracted India-China war,
  which can only result in further detriment to India, China and the cause of all
  oppressed people.</p>

  <h4>SINCE NEHRU'S VISIT</h4>

  <p>Since the Indian Prime Minister left the shores of the U.S. there have been only
  rare intervals in which there has been a let up in the war fever fanned by the Indian
  bourgeoisie and its agent Nehru. For a long time Nehru played the role of moderator
  between left and right in the Indian-China border dispute, cautioning the extremist
  elements of the bourgeoisie in Parliament, and repudiating suggestions for offensive
  operations by his military advisers.</p>

  <p>But his October 4 decision, taken after a cabinet meeting, made it clear beyond any
  shadow of a doubt that he had completely capitulated to the right wing on this issue
  and was kowtowing to U.S. imperialist interests.</p>

  <p>The present military efforts of the Chinese are merely a response to the offensive
  action taken after the Indian cabinet session.</p>

  <h4>A DEFENSIVE BATTLE</h4>

  <p>The Chinese government is fighting a defensive battle. It is only too well aware
  that U.S. imperialism is ready at all times to take advantage of any preoccupation that
  China may have with India to open another front against China wherever and whenever it
  finds it feasible, whether it be in the Pescadores, the Taiwan strait or new
  harassments over the air space of China.</p>

  <p>There are those who say China should give in &mdash; give up what belongs to China
  in the interest of peace. These are the people who are always ready to give, especially
  things that do not belong to them.</p>

  <p>When to give &mdash; or whether to give &mdash; is a question which only the Chinese
  can decide, as it as <em>their</em> territory. Surely the Chinese, who have gone
  through hell and fire in the course of 22 years of civil war, in which they have had to
  trade many times &mdash; space for time &mdash; and in fact have endured many retreats,
  need no reminders on this score.</p>

  <h4>SOLIDARITY OF ASIAN PEOPLE</h4>

  <p>The workers of the world and the progressive anti-imperialist countries in
  particular, are most deeply concerned in a speedy, reasonable and honorable settlement
  on the part of China and India. Such a settlement can only be arrived at if the ruling
  group in New Delhi accepts China's offer for the resumption of talks on a high level
  between the two governments without any pre conditions. A border settlement would
  remove a tremendous obstacle to the solidarity of the Asian people who are struggling
  for a new life, and would be a tremendous rebuff to imperialism and its servants and
  underlings.</p>
