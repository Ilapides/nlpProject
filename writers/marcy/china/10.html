  <h1>The Cultural Revolution and the Fall of Lin Piao</h1>

  <h3>Appendix Parts I and II</h3>

  <h4>August 4 and August 25, 1972</h4>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>Editor's note</strong> "The Cultural Revolution and the Fall of Lin Piao" was
    written by Sam Marcy in August, 1972, after the appearance of the official version of
    the death and purge of Lin Piao. This event signaled a struggle over policy in the
    highest levels of the Chinese leadership, particularly over the Nixon visit and the
    rapprochement with U.S. imperialism.

    <p>The suppression of the Left in China begins with the fall of Lin Piao and Chen
    Po-ta. We reprint the articles in <a href="2_index.html">"China and the Class War
    1959 - 1972"</a> because they offer a broad historical overview of the Cultural
    Revolution &mdash; the blocking of capitalist restoration and the safeguarding of the
    new social relations established by the Chinese Revolution of 1949 and deepened by
    the Great Leap Forward and the Commune movement of 1958-59.</p>

    <p>Sam Marcy makes extensive use of Engels' analysis of earlier great revolutions to
    show how, the Cultural Revolution grew from historical necessity but that once that
    historical task was fulfilled in China, the base of the revolutionary left was eroded
    and the ideas of "storming the heavens" and creating a new Paris Commune-type of
    state were jettisoned. Subsequent events, covered in the earlier articles in this
    pamphlet, have all confirmed this analysis.</p>
