  <h1>Why Did China Do It?</h1>

  <h4>July 30, 1971</h4><em>By SAM MARCY</em>

  <p>Enough time has now elapsed since the announcement of Nixon's projected visit to the
  People's Republic of China for all to see that this is not an incidental diplomatic
  maneuver soon to be submerged and forgotten in the welter of international affairs.</p>

  <p>What is emerging in general outline is not a mere normalization of relations, but a
  projected rapprochement between the U.S., and People's China, something more in the
  nature of a broad agreement.</p>

  <h4>NIXON'S MOTIVATION</h4>

  <p>It is much easier to explain the motivation for the Nixon Administration's
  undertaking a visit to China than it is to explain why China extended the invitation in
  the first place.</p>

  <p>It can scarcely be denied that the U.S., ruling class finds itself in a virtually
  impossible situation in Southeast Asia. The crushing defeat handed to U.S., imperialism
  by the Vietnamese people during the Tet offensive as well as the ill-fated invasion of
  Laos and Cambodia, have made it plain to the overwhelming majority of the people in
  this country and to a larger section of the ruling class that the mad adventure in
  Vietnam is a lost cause. The inability of aggressive U.S., militarism to turn the tide
  in Vietnam after so many years of stubborn persistence has signalled the end of an era
  in U.S., imperialist supremacy.</p>

  <p>The Vietnam catastrophe of American finance capital symbolizes the general decline
  of American capitalism and its inability to solve its fundamental contradictions,
  either at home or abroad. The most crying contradiction for the ruling class is the
  spectacle of the Nixon Administration daily promising to "end the war soon" while
  continuing the bombing and rejecting the offers of the NLF (National Liberation Front)
  and the DRV (Democratic Republic of Vietnam) to seriously discuss withdrawal.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances it is quite understandable why the Nixon Administration
  would undertake some new way to help salvage and refortify the U.S., imperialist
  position.</p>

  <p>This is what motivated Nixon to undertake his projected visit to China. It is not "a
  journey for peace" but a new method to achieve the same objective: to refurbish the
  tarnished image of the U.S., ruling class and to strengthen its diplomatic and military
  position.</p>

  <h4>COLOSSAL DISAPPOINTMENT</h4>

  <p>What, then, motivated China to extend the invitation at a moment when the fortunes
  of American imperialism seem to be at its lowest ebb? It is necessary to examine this
  from two points of view: from the point of view of its international significance as
  far as the revolutionary liberation movements and the world working class are
  concerned, and secondly, from the point of view of how it will affect the national
  interests of China as a workers' (socialist) state.</p>

  <p>Insofar as the revolutionary forces in the liberation movements and the working
  class movement generally are concerned, the invitation certainly came as a colossal
  disappointment. Its very suddenness and particularly the secret character of the
  negotiations, cannot but be viewed with apprehension.</p>

  <p>To prepare such a sharp turn and in total secrecy is completely alien to the
  Leninist conception of conducting international relations with imperialist powers.</p>

  <h4>SECRET DIPLOMACY NOT IN LENINIST TRADITION</h4>

  <p>Was this not what the Chinese CP objected to in Khrushchev's diplomacy? Lenin made
  public all the secret treaties of the Czar and conducted diplomatic relations with the
  Germans, the French and the British openly. Never for a moment was the revolutionary
  vanguard in doubt as to the world revolutionary orientation of the Soviet Republic,
  that it put the interests of the world revolutionary movement ahead of the interests of
  the Soviet Republic.</p>

  <p>"Open treaties, openly arrived at" was a slogan mouthed by Woodrow Wilson, but only
  the Soviet Republic under Lenin's leadership put it into practice. Secret diplomacy
  keeps the imperialists informed and the masses in the dark.</p>

  <p>There can be no getting away from the fact that this venture into secret diplomacy
  by the Chinese leaders has caused a serious setback to the revolutionary movement of
  the world, and the ruling class has, at least temporarily, gotten a psychological lift
  as well as a diplomatic one. Its morale and outlook have been improved, even if it is
  only temporary.</p>

  <p>In sum, as the Chinese leaders have so often said and done, the goal of the
  revolution is not only to raise the consciousness of the masses, to give them
  confidence in the struggle against the class enemy, but also to uphold the principles
  of proletarian internationalism. Judged by these criteria, the irresistible conclusion
  is that the Nixon invitation is a setback to the revolutionary movement.</p>

  <h4>KHRUSHCHEV'S CUBAN CRISIS DIPLOMACY</h4>

  <p>One of the highly objectionable elements of Khrushchev's diplomacy with the U.S.,
  during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 was the failure of the Soviet leaders to
  consult with the Cuban leaders during the negotiations.</p>

  <p>Scarcely anything could have been more important than to have mutual consultations
  on how to confront the imperialists during such a great crisis. Nonetheless, the
  government of Premier Fidel Castro was informed of the outcome of the negotiations
  through the capitalist press. What a humiliation! The Chinese CP attacked the Soviet
  leaders for doing thus, as we did and others too.</p>

  <p>It is very clear now that the announcement of Nixon's projected visit to Peking, let
  alone the long negotiations between Kissinger and Premier Chou En-lai, were not
  coordinated with the DRV and NLF, who are fighting against the genocidal war conducted
  against the Vietnamese by the Nixon Administration.</p>

  <h4>VIETNAMESE VIEW OF NIXON VISIT</h4>

  <p>It is no wonder that <em>Nhan Dan,</em> the official newspaper of the DRV, made it
  abundantly clear that it was opposed to a "compromise between the big powers in an
  attempt to make smaller countries bow to their arrangements."</p>

  <p>Who could they mean in this context but China and the U.S.? To make absolutely
  certain how they regard the Nixon visit, <em>Nhan Dan</em> said that Nixon "has been
  running about wildly in search of a way out. But he has gone to the wrong place. The
  exit door has been opened, yet he has tumbled into an impasse."</p>

  <p>Certainly it cannot be doubted that what the DRV and the NLF want is for Nixon to
  negotiate with <strong>them</strong> on the question of the war, that the place is
  either Paris or Hanoi, not Peking, and that the subject is the withdrawal of the U.S.,
  imperialist forces and their satellites from the territory of Vietnam.</p>

  <p>Of course, China has supported the seven-point program of the NLF and the DRV and
  has continually supported their struggle. But this doesn't obviate Kissinger's long
  negotiations with the Chinese leader and the fact that the Vietnamese were not
  consulted.</p>

  <p>It is very clear that one of the objective effects of Nixon's diplomacy is not only
  to widen the rift between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, but to
  utilize any eventual agreement that may come out of the negotiations to the detriment
  of the Soviet Union.</p>

  <h4>NIXON EXPLOITS USSR-CHINA RIFT</h4>

  <p>The Soviet leaders have only themselves to blame in the event of such an outcome. It
  must be remembered that the substance of the ideological struggle between China and the
  Soviet Union was particularly over the attitude toward imperialism. The Soviet
  revisionists were trying hard for an accommodation with the imperialists, to the
  detriment of the revolutionary movement. In fact, so far and deep has the process of
  Soviet accommodation with the imperialists, particularly the U.S., gone that in the
  eyes of the Chinese CP, the Soviet Union was only in words preaching socialism but in
  effect had degenerated to imperialist practices. China has been denouncing the Soviet
  leaders, not only for collaborating with the imperialists, but for having made a
  virtual alliance with them against the People's Republic of China.</p>

  <p>Certainly the whole course of the last decade is abundant proof in that direction.
  We have previously written about this in this newspaper and have attacked the Soviet
  leaders for their course.</p>

  <h4>OUR FORECAST OF CHINA-U.S. PACT</h4>

  <p>For several years now we have felt that the ultimate result of the Soviet policy in
  relation to China might be just such a development as we are now witnessing in the turn
  of Sino-U.S. relations.</p>

  <p>As long ago as the 1966 Labor Day Conference of Workers World Party, held at the
  Cornish Arms Hotel in New York City, we said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "If the ideological struggle between the Chinese party and the Soviet revisionists
    deepens and becomes a struggle between states, then it is possible that People's
    China may make a pact with the U.S., against the USSR."
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>In response to comrades at the 1966 Labor Day Conference who asked if such
  a development might change our attitude to People's China itself, we explained that
  "the eventuality of such a pact would in no way affect our class loyalty to the Chinese
  socialist republic. We would defend it against imperialism even though we disagreed
  with the pact &mdash; just as we defended the USSR, even during the Stalin-Hitler
  Pact."

  <p>Certainly Nixon's efforts in personal diplomacy are very much akin to Hitler's.
  Hitler, too, maintained that the pact with Stalin was in the interest of peace. The
  pact at that time had a demoralizing influence on the revolutionary movement. Many
  people in this country were so outraged by the pact that they completely lost their
  moorings and declared that the Soviet Union was an imperialist state.</p>

  <p>It was further explained at the Conference that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "What we opposed in Stalin at that time, was not the principle of his right to enter
    into an agreement with an imperialist nation. What we opposed was the way it was done
    &mdash; the secrecy, the shock to the proletarian forces, his painting up of the
    enforced agreement as a great thing and his softening of his previous position
    against Hitler as a result."
  </blockquote>

  <p>This explanation, given at our Conference in 1966 holds true for today in the wake
  of the new turn in Sino-U.S, relations.</p>

  <p>The turn of Chinese foreign policy in relation to the U.S. cannot be explained
  solely as a response to Soviet revisionist policy, however. That has a great deal to do
  with it, of course, but China's new turn in foreign policy cannot be wholly explained
  by this alone.</p>

  <h4>DEEPER CAUSE OF NEW TURN</h4>

  <p>The deeper cause lies in the failure of the Chinese Revolution to spread to the rest
  of Asia, as it did to Vietnam and Korea. The inability of the Chinese party to win
  large and influential communist parties away from revisionism and toward a
  revolutionary position is a key factor in the situation. In this sense, it is correct
  to contrast the course of the Chinese Revolution to the early days of the Russian
  Revolution. From the very first day of the victory of the October Revolution, hundreds
  of thousands of revolutionary socialists throughout the world immediately split from
  the Social-Democratic Parties (Second International) and, by 1919, were rallying around
  the Communist International as the vanguard of the world revolution.</p>

  <p>The decisive sections of the revolutionary proletariat came over to communism as
  against social democracy.</p>

  <h4>PARALLEL WITH RUSSIAN REVOLUTION</h4>

  <p>The Chinese CP has been unable, for various historic reasons, to win over large
  constituted revolutionary parties in the same way that the early Leninist policies won
  over large and decisive sections of the world revolutionary movement. The Soviet Union
  at that time became not only the inspiration for revolutionary struggle, but its guide
  in theory and practice.</p>

  <p>The Chinese Revolution, like the Russian Revolution, evoked a series of
  revolutionary situations abroad, which unfortunately were defeated. The big defeat in
  Indonesia in 1955, however one explains its causes, was a setback to the Chinese
  Revolution in the same way that the defeat in Germany, in Italy and in Hungary in the
  early 1920s set back the Russian Revolution and ushered in a policy of retreat from
  world revolutionary goals.</p>

  <h4>RETREAT TO "NATIONAL" SOCIALISM</h4>

  <p>This policy of retreat is not only due to the failure of the Indonesian Revolution,
  however. It is also explained by the re-emergence of Japanese imperialism. The strong
  and numerous Japanese proletariat has been unable to develop a strong revolutionary
  Marxist party capable of challenging Japanese imperialism. All this, together with the
  encirclement of the People's Republic of China by a multitude of imperialist puppet
  regimes, plus the hostility of the Soviet leaders, has caused China to retreat to a
  position, at least for a period, of "national" socialism of taking care of the national
  interest in such a way as to subordinate the interests of the international
  revolutionary movement.</p>

  <p>In this way the Chinese leaders hope to defeat U.S. plans for its isolation, to
  strengthen its international contacts in commerce and trade, and also to participate in
  the world power struggle along with the Soviet Union and the U.S.</p>

  <p>But the question for revolutionaries is, again, how and in what manner will this
  policy affect the world movement of the oppressed and the working class in general.</p>

  <h4>JUDGMENT OF SPOKESMEN FOR THE RULING CLASS</h4>

  <p>In the immediate sense, the ruling class here hopes that a concrete result of the
  Sino-U.S. negotiation and the projected visit of Nixon to Peking will result in an
  amelioration of its catastrophic position in Southeast Asia.</p>

  <p>The Wall Street Journal, which speaks for a large section of the ruling class, said
  in its lead editorial of July 22, that a concrete deal between the U.S. and China lies
  somewhere between Washington giving somewhat on Taiwan and China giving somewhat on
  Vietnam.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "The new thaw," says the editorial "if it proves more than momentary, is likely to
    have its effect on the speed and shape of the war's conclusion. It's even possible to
    see the hazy outlines of some kind of a deal, since the Americans want help in ending
    the war in some reasonably honorable way, and the Chinese want some movement on the
    issue of Taiwan."
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Wall Street Journal continues a little further on:</p>

  <blockquote>
    While anything so overt is only a remote possibility, the President's China trip is
    bound to have at least an indirect impact in Vietnam, and it's hard to conceive that
    his impact will be anything but favorable.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Such are the calculations of the ruling class in general, to one degree or another.
  They are banking on a projected Sino-U.S. agreement which would pull them out, or at
  least partially improve their desperate situation in Southeast Asia. But this is only a
  projection.</p>

  <p>For one thing, they are not counting on the intransigence of the Vietnamese people,
  an error they have been making for almost a quarter of a century. As we noted above,
  the Vietnamese are only too well aware of what they call "big-power politics" and they
  are not likely to be a passive object in any U.S.-China rapprochement which concerns
  their interests.</p>

  <h4>LASTING SIGNIFICANCE OF CULTURAL REVOLUTION</h4>

  <p>Of course, no rapprochement between China and the U.S. is likely to materially
  affect the internal social structure of the People's Republic of China. It is much too
  late in the day for that. The Chinese Revolution is one of the greatest triumphs in
  modern times. During the decade of the fifties, it consolidated the power of the
  socialist state and laid the foundations for socialist construction. In the period of
  the sixties, it opened an immense campaign to drive back and crush the neo-bourgeois
  restorationists' influence in the party and in the government. At rock bottom, that was
  the real significance of the Cultural Revolution. It saved China from a bourgeois
  restoration and set back the forces of bureaucratic degeneration.</p>

  <p>China set a revolutionary example by fighting bourgeois restoration on the home
  front and its political ideology, revisionism. It opened the road for genuine mass
  participation of the workers and peasants in the socialist transformation of China.</p>

  <h4>CHINA AND USSR COMPARED</h4>

  <p>In this respect, there is scarcely a bourgeois observer who has not attested to the
  success of the People's Republic of China. Instead of fostering and encouraging the
  growth of a parasitic bureaucracy, the Cultural Revolution drastically cut them down.
  Our opponent political tendencies in the radical movement here, such as the SWP and the
  CP, were opposed to the Cultural Revolution, although from different points of view,
  they say. We supported it wholeheartedly. The Cultural Revolution is a lasting monument
  to the socialist transformation of a quarter of the human race.</p>

  <p>Whatever subsequent political exigencies may impel China toward an erroneous course
  on international relations, the fundamental achievement of the Cultural Revolution
  remains a formidable obstacle to any internal regression. In this respect, China also
  stands way above the Soviet Union, where an entrenched, ever-growing bureaucratic
  apparatus is daily encouraged by the leadership, and moves further away from socialist
  norms even as it continues to develop technologically and economically as a deformed
  socialist state.</p>

  <p>While we regard Soviet revisionist policy as growing fundamentally out of the very
  nature of the privileged bureaucracy which dominates the socialist state, the same
  cannot be said of China. It is for this reason that we view the projected Sino-U.S.
  rapprochement as a temporary departure and not as growing out of a congenital need of
  the social system of China.</p>

  <h4>PACT SEEN AS TEMPORARY DEPARTURE</h4>

  <p>For this reason the imperialist bourgeoisie cannot count on any long-lasting
  agreement with the Chinese People's Republic that would fundamentally disavow or
  appreciably alter the socialist direction of the Chinese workers' state.</p>

  <p>There is no peace in the world today, nor will there be any, as long as imperialism
  exists. At best, peace is merely an interlude between imperialist wars. It is in this
  light that we should view the turn in Sino-U.S. relations.</p>
