  <h1>No Intervention in Bangla Desh!</h1>

  <h4>December 1, 1971</h4>

  <p>The struggle of the people of Bangla Desh for self-determination is in danger of
  being overshadowed by the antagonisms of the great powers which have become involved as
  parties to the present military conflict.</p>

  <p>As Indian and Pakistani troops clash along the border of Bangla Desh ("East
  Pakistan"), the United States is diplomatically juggling with both sides, while
  supporting Pakistan militarily. Washington claims to have ended its arms shipments to
  Pakistan, but even its own press is not convinced. It is also not precluded that U.S.
  imperialism may wind up providing arms to both sides in the hopes of generating a
  suicidal struggle while exploitation, and the most profitable trade of all &mdash; in
  arms &mdash; goes on.</p>

  <p>U.S. imperialism's objectives are to continue to exploit the millions of
  near-starving peasants and workers in India, Pakistan, and Bangla Desh. They would
  prefer doing this without becoming directly involved in the war, particularly since
  they are still trying to chart a new course to compensate for the great losses suffered
  in Southeast Asia and the consequent shift in consciousness among the masses in the
  U.S., who now strongly oppose any further military adventures.</p>

  <h4>U.S. SEEKS WAR BETWEEN CHINA AND USSR</h4>

  <p>But the other element of U.S. strategy vis-a-vis the Indian subcontinent is that
  Washington wants nothing more, despite all its pious protestations to the contrary,
  than to see the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union drawn into a war
  against one another. This has been the aim of imperialist diplomacy ever since the
  development of the two large socialist countries, for the U.S. realizes what a terrible
  setback such a course would mean for the world socialist revolution, both in terms of
  the morale of the workers and oppressed, and for the material advantage this would give
  the imperialists. If the two great socialist powers were tied down in a war, even one
  fought by proxy, Wall Street's hands would be freed to intensify its rapacious search
  for profits in Asia, the Middle East, and all over the globe.</p>

  <p>Certainly the foreign affairs analysts of the U.S. imperialist ruling class must
  feel that the possibility of provoking such a confrontation is more likely in the
  present situation than at any previous juncture in history, since People's China is
  supporting the Yahya Khan government, while the Soviet Union has signed a military pact
  with the Indian bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>It is particularly unfortunate for the whole revolutionary movement that China is
  now doing what they have correctly attacked the Soviet revisionists for doing over many
  years: aligning themselves with a belligerent bourgeois regime instead of with the
  masses who are in revolt. Nor can these alliances be said to favor either the Pakistani
  or Indian masses, who are decidedly unenthusiastic about the sabre-rattling carried out
  by their respective ruling classes. Even the Indian workers and peasants who sympathize
  with the Bengali liberation struggle show no desire for a war between India and
  Pakistan.</p>

  <h4>BENGALI SELF-DETERMINATION. KEYSTONE OF STRUGGLE<br />
  <br /></h4>

  <p>What began last spring as a self determination struggle of the oppressed nation of
  Bangla Desh could still be the spark of a wider revolutionary struggle on the whole
  subcontinent. We believe, as was stated in our analysis of August 17, 1971, that all
  communists and progressives must attempt to further the revolutionary struggle of the
  workers and peasants of the whole area, which is today taking place within the
  framework of a struggle for self-determination. To support the bourgeoisie of either
  India or Pakistan is to liquidate the class struggle, inflame national antagonisms, and
  undermine the possibility of a united front of all the poor and oppressed against
  imperialism and domestic bourgeois reaction.</p>

  <p>It must be added, however, that the Bengali people are correct in trying to get aid
  wherever they can find it. But India's motives in giving such aid must be assessed from
  the point of view of the Indian bourgeoisie, who are not interested in
  self-determination for the Bengali people but want to stifle the class struggle that
  threatens to erupt throughout the whole Bengali nation, including the millions within
  India's borders. India is feverishly trying to take command of the rebellion, in
  collaboration with the conservative Awami League, to prevent the revolutionary and
  socialist elements in the people's liberation forces from determining the course of
  struggle.</p>

  <p>It is a fundamental understanding of Leninism that every oppressed nation must have
  the right of self-determination; that to deny that right is only to postpone, perhaps
  indefinitely, the hour when the propertyless classes within the nation can take their
  destiny in their own hands and begin the class struggle against the domestic ruling
  class for their total emancipation.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie in Bangla Desh began the struggle for independence, but the history
  of similar struggles in the epoch of imperialism has shown that nowhere has the
  national bourgeoisie been able to carry the fight for independence from imperialist
  domination and for true national sovereignty through to its completion. Only the
  oppressed masses of workers and peasants can fulfill this historic task in a struggle
  for the socialist reconstruction of society; but in Bangla Desh today, as in many other
  oppressed nations around the world, the ultimate class struggle that will put the
  international reorganization of society on the order of the day makes its first
  appearance in the form of a self-determination struggle against very real and pervasive
  national oppression.</p>

  <p>For those who live and struggle here inside the imperialist monster itself, our
  responsibilities to the Bengali people and to the consciousness of American workers
  must first be to expose consistently the role of U.S. imperialism. Nixon is not a
  mediator desiring peace on earth; rather he is seeking to fan the flames of a war that
  can strengthen the U.S. economy through lucrative arms sales while it threatens to
  embroil Washington's two greatest rivals for world hegemony in a suicidal conflict.</p>

  <p>Finally, let it be said that the United Nations can play no progressive role in this
  war. The UN has shown itself again and again, in Korea, the Congo, and in its
  consistent failure to condemn U.S. aggression, to be dominated by imperialism. (China's
  admission does not alter this fact. Nor does it make intervention correct; the fate of
  the masses of the Indian subcontinent must be settled by them alone. Intervention by
  either capitalist or socialist countries would set back the revolutionary movements of
  the workers and peasants.)</p>

  <p>To invite in the UN in whatever role is only to invite in Nixon and Co. behind a
  "peace-loving" facade. We must unmask the representatives of a monopoly capitalism
  whose strength in Asia, as everywhere, ultimately rests on their success in exploiting
  the workers and oppressed people at home.</p>
