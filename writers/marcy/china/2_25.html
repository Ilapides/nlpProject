  <hr />

  <h1>A Preliminary Appraisal &mdash;<br />
  What the China Trip Signifies</h1>

  <h4>March 2, 1972</h4><em>By DEIRDRE GRISWOLD</em>

  <p>It has been apparent for several years now, and was confirmed by the publication of
  the Pentagon Papers that the great victories of the Vietnamese and Indochinese peoples
  marked the end of an era for U.S. imperialism. As Sam Marcy, Chairman of Workers World
  Party wrote in this newspaper last July: "That phase of American history which . . .
  saw aggressive American finance capital reach the pinnacle of its power on the world
  arena has forever vanished."</p>

  <p>Nixon's trip to China reflects this new reality, and was an attempt to retrieve in
  the diplomatic and political arena what could not be won on the battlefield with the
  costliest and most modern weaponry. But the motives of the U.S. ruling class in
  underwriting the Nixon trip should be clear to all but the most brainwashed. The
  question troubling revolutionaries and those who side with the oppressed of all nations
  is: Why did China do it?</p>

  <p>There are actually two separate questions to be considered. The first concerns
  China's natural desire to normalize state relations with the United States, which
  involves diplomatic recognition, an end to the embargo on trade, a broadening of
  travel, etc. Despite the absolutely irreconcilable character of the class antagonisms
  between capitalism and socialism, such normalization can be possible without
  sacrificing revolutionary internationalism, without yielding any ground in the struggle
  to raise the consciousness of the workers and oppressed. In the Soviet Union at the
  time of Lenin (when all other nations were either capitalist or colonized by them),
  Soviet diplomacy adhered to this principle.</p>

  <p>In the joint communique issued by the U.S. and the People's Republic of China at the
  end of the discussions, a major breakthrough in the diplomatic recognition of China by
  the U.S. was announced. Taiwan, the island fortress where U.S. men and arms have kept
  alive the corrupt and repressive regime of Chiang Kai-Shek, is no longer called by
  Washington the "legitimate" government of all China, and U.S. troops are to be removed
  as the first step toward the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China without
  outside Interference. This is certainly a significant victory for People's China, one
  which brings the liberation of Taiwan that much closer. We hope that the People's
  Republic has also derived other benefits from these talks.</p>

  <p>The crucial question, however, in this epoch of the transition on a world scale from
  capitalism to socialism, is what effect will the new relationship between China and the
  U.S. have on the national liberation movements and on proletarian revolutionaries
  throughout the world? At this writing, it is impossible to foresee what all the
  long-range effects will be, and Workers World will have more to say on this later.
  However, based on the spirit of the visit that has just taken place, one conclusion is
  irresistible: we are compelled to recognize that the principled foreign policy of
  revolutionary internationalism for which the People's Republic fought so hard in the
  international communist movement, and which was so reviled by the Soviet revisionists,
  has been revoked. The present relations with U.S. imperialism are being carried out in
  the revisionist spirit of peaceful coexistence, or class conciliation, instead of class
  struggle, which China so correctly denounced in the past.</p>

  <p>This summit meeting was held in the "spirit of Camp David, when Khrushchev came to
  meet Eisenhower and called him a man of "peace." The Chinese leadership, while it is
  not guilty of such deceptive pronouncements, has allowed Nixon to appear in such a
  light without contradiction. The very fact that Nixon was allowed to use the territory
  of a socialist country to launch a gaudy, extravagant election campaign makes a mockery
  of what sounds good and revolutionary in the Chinese statement. The very fact that the
  Chinese leadership can toast the imperialist chief of state while his troops are still
  engaged in murder and plunder just on the other side of the border sows demoralization
  and pessimism in the hearts of dedicated fighters who have been willing to give their
  very lives in the struggle for a new world. Much, much more has been involved in this
  historic week than a movement to normalize state relations between China and the U.S.
  Such a development does not require face-to-face meetings between the two heads of
  state. Kissinger, or Rogers, or a dozen lesser officials could have made the necessary
  contacts for such an arrangement. The display, the pomp, the banquets and toasting, the
  40 hours of private discussions between Richard Nixon and Chou En-Lai, all these
  features of the visit lead everyone to suppose, despite ail the official denials, that
  a secret agreement or at least the initial stages of such an agreement, much broader
  than the joint communique on Taiwan, was the result of the trip. One of the first moves
  of the new Soviet state in 1917 was to make public all the secret agreements made by
  the Czar. "Open diplomacy" was a principle of Leninism that received an immediate
  response from the masses all over the world, who have been the object of history for so
  many centuries. Thus principle was long ago abandoned by the revisionist Soviet
  leadership.</p>

  <p>It is because any socialist country, and especially one with a great revolutionary
  tradition, carries such great moral authority with the progressive masses of the world
  that its every act must be judged first and foremost by these criteria does it help
  raise the class consciousness of the masses: does it inspire them to struggle against
  the class enemy &mdash; in this case, the worst enemy of humanity as the Chinese
  themselves have so often called U.S. imperialism? Judged from this viewpoint, it is
  only too clear that the abrupt turn in China's attitude toward the U.S. can do nothing
  but confuse the masses and sap the energies of the vanguard.</p>

  <p>(There is, of course, a plus in the fact that people in this country are finally
  getting a glimpse at the stunning accomplishments of the Chinese Revolution. Many of
  the lies about China were demolished by the photographic evidence of healthy, energetic
  people living in a modern society.)</p>

  <h4>DIFFER WITH POLICY BUT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SOCIALIST STATE</h4>

  <p>Workers World's analysis of the revisionist turn in China's foreign policy should
  not be confused with the hysterical accusations being heaped on the People's Republic
  by those parties that do not support her socialist economic foundations nor have any
  respect for the great revolutionary accomplishments of her leaders. We have been
  unswerving supporters of China since the establishment of this great socialist state.
  We welcomed China's revolutionary criticism of the Soviet Union's revisionist role, and
  the pages of this newspaper have reprinted many of the most significant Chinese
  statements attacking class conciliation and capitulation to imperialism in the
  international communist movement.</p>

  <p>We exposed India's attempts at aggression (encouraged by U.S. imperialism) in the
  border dispute, at a time when the Indian Communist Party (pro-Moscow) entirely
  supported the Nehru government. Workers World saw in the Cultural Revolution a mighty
  attempt to disintegrate a movement that would restore class privilege, and eventually
  capitalist rule.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, our support of the People's Republic of China as a socialist state, as
  a society where the privileged ruling classes have been expropriated and their
  mechanism of rule shattered, remains unshakable despite our disagreement with the
  policies of the leadership.</p>

  <p>But this new page in world relationships brought about under the tremendous pressure
  of imperialism, still so vastly wealthy even though in social eclipse, combined with
  the hostility of the Soviet revisionists &mdash; demands more than ever that serious
  revolutionaries sharpen the tools of Marxism-Leninism, perceive the validity of the
  class struggle, and continue to prepare themselves and the masses for the social
  cataclysms that will inevitably accompany the breakup of this decaying system.</p>

  <h4>WWP LEADER FORESAW POSSIBLE SINO-U.S. AGREEMENT</h4>

  <p>At the 1966 Labor Day Conference of Workers World Party, Chairman Sam Marcy
  discussed the then-theoretical possibility that the Sino-Soviet split might drive China
  into an agreement with U.S. imperialism: "If the ideological struggle between the
  Chinese party and the Soviet revisionists deepens and becomes a struggle between
  states, then it is possible that People's China may make a pact with the U.S. against
  the USSR. This would be a modern version of the Stalin-Hitler Pact."</p>

  <p>Comrade Marcy explained that such a development would not change the attitude of the
  WWP toward People's China itself. Workers World would defend China against imperialism
  even though we disagreed with the policy, just as we defended the Soviet Union while
  attacking the way in which the Stalin-Hitler Pact was carried out.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "What we opposed in Stalin at that time," said Comrade Marcy, "was not the principle
    of his right to enter into an agreement with an imperialist nation. What we opposed
    was the way it was done &mdash; the secrecy, the shock to the proletarian forces, his
    painting up of the enforced agreement as a great thing and his softening of his
    previous position against Hitler as a result.

    <p>"Similarly, after Hitler broke the pact and turned has guns on the Soviet Union,
    we opposed Stalin's painting up the imperialist democracies. We opposed his
    demoralizing the world proletariat with the idea that the democratic imperialists
    were fundamentally superior to the fascist imperialists, although of course we
    defended the Soviet Union against the fascists. Stalin's position seriously weakened
    the conscious forces of world revolution and in the long run eroded the revolutionary
    role of the Soviet Union on the world arena."</p>
