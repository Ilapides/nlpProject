  <h1>Stakes in China's Struggle (Part 1)</h1>

  <h3>Revolution vs. Restoration</h3>

  <h4>January 20, 1967</h4><em>By SAM MARCY</em>

  <p>The Chinese Communist Party has been the strongest, truest, and most devoted of all
  the parties in the struggle for Marxism and socialism. It has courageously,
  energetically and with consummate skill and ability charted and carried through the
  greatest social and political transformation on behalf of more than a quarter of the
  human race. Its most formidable and enduring achievement has been the splendid
  adaptation of Marxism to the very difficult conditions of China.</p>

  <h4>THE REMARKABLE RECORD</h4>

  <p>Through all the trials and tribulations of the civil war and thereafter the party
  retained a truly remarkable continuity of its basic cadres and central leadership. No
  small achievement, when one considers what has happened elsewhere! To this should be
  added the fact that it has been relatively free from such purges as characterized the
  period of Stalin's leadership. Furthermore, the party has consistently encouraged and
  cultivated a high degree of criticism and self-criticism in its ranks, unequaled
  anywhere else.</p>

  <p>When one remembers that the life of the party for most of its existence has been
  conducted in the very shadow, if not in the midst of war and threatened invasion, only
  then can one gauge what a truly monumental achievement this has been. Needless to say
  all of this has been achieved under the direct guidance and leadership of Mao
  Tse-tung.</p>

  <h4>CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN COMMUNIST TRADITION</h4>

  <p>Has the cultural revolution catapulted the party and the country into a historically
  reverse direction? Let us see:</p>

  <p>The cultural revolution was launched last August by decision of the Central
  Committee of the Party. Since then, its general aims and objectives have become known
  in practically all corners of the globe. It proposes, among other things, to root out
  all "old ideas, cultures, customs and habits of the exploiting classes" &mdash; and ".
  . . to transform education, literature and art and all other parts of the
  superstructure that do not correspond to the socialist base . . ."</p>

  <p>How can any genuine Communist quarrel with this? Has it not been an integral part of
  the understanding of all Communists that the old order, with its old ideas, old
  culture, and habits of the exploiting classes should be abolished and that new,
  revolutionary, socialist ideas, customs and habits be instituted to conform to the
  socialist foundation of the new regime? Isn't this one of the principal reasons why the
  socialist revolution was made in the first place? And as a matter of fact, has this not
  been the proclaimed goal in all socialist countries? Of course! What is really new
  about all this is the inflexible determination of the leadership of the Chinese
  Communist Party to make an earnest effort to really bring it about in practice. That is
  what is new!</p>

  <h4>A STRUGGLE TO CRUSH OFFICIALDOM</h4>

  <p>Had the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party merely confined itself to
  promulgating the cultural revolution in an abstract and pedagogical manner and let it
  go at that, it would have scarcely caused a ripple. But the Chinese CP went further.
  The August Decision of the Central Committee did more than just make a bold and
  courageous announcement. To its great credit, it launched a struggle for its success.
  That is a qualitatively different matter.</p>

  <p>The August Decision proclaimed the necessity &mdash; "to struggle against and crush
  those persons in authority" who are actively opposing the cultural revolution and in
  fact "are taking the capitalist road."</p>

  <p>It is this that has evoked the frenzied hatred of the imperialist rulers, their
  lackeys and apologists and raised a storm of resistance from the rightist opposition at
  home.</p>

  <h4>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND COMMUNISTS<br />
  <br /></h4>

  <p>What was the fundamental difference in approach to the Socialist Revolution between
  the classical Social Democrats and the Communists? The Social Democrats were for the
  revolution, too &mdash; in words &mdash; but they refused "to struggle against and
  crush those persons in authority" who were opposing the revolution! That in essence is
  precisely what the issue is today. One can talk and propagandize for the cultural
  revolution for decades. But to put up a serious, resolute struggle and at whatever cost
  to ensure its victory, is something else again.</p>

  <h4>THE CONCERN OF SINCERE FRIENDS</h4>

  <p>Notwithstanding all that has been said, there is, nevertheless, grave and serious
  concern among many sincere and honest friends of the Chinese People's Republic over the
  form and method that the struggle has taken. They view with growing alarm what appears
  to them the extra-legal and extra-governmental activities of the Red Guards and they
  question the wisdom of having them assume political functions which normally would be
  exercised by the well-established mass organizations, party institutions and
  governmental authorities of the People's Republic.</p>

  <p>It must, however, be remembered that the cultural revolution is after all a
  revolution, and as such, is subject to the same general laws as all revolutions. Rarest
  of all social phenomena is the revolution that can be fully developed strictly within
  the confines of the existing social and political framework!</p>

  <h4>THE STRUGGLE HAS ITS OWN LOGIC</h4>

  <p>Nor can it be said that there exists complete freedom of choice as regards either
  the method or form of the struggle, when once the battle has been joined. Indeed, much
  depends on the time, the concrete circumstance and the character of the adversary in
  the given struggle. This does not, however, mean that there is any solid ground for
  assuming, as the capitalist press would have us believe, that the great mass
  organizations of the Chinese people, their formidable party institutions and the
  numerous governmental organs including the army will not loyally support the cultural
  revolution and the leaders who are at its head.</p>

  <h4>"STRIFE IS THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS"</h4>

  <p>The attainment of such a world historic victory for socialism as is envisioned by
  the architects of the cultural revolution could probably not be won without a serious
  internal struggle even under more favorable circumstances than prevail today. But in
  the context of the present historical conjuncture, it is made doubly difficult by the
  existence of revisionism as the dominant political tendency in the international
  Communist movement. Its definite triumph in the ruling stratum of the Soviet Union and
  the leadership of the principle parties of Western Europe and elsewhere could not but
  reverberate on the social soil of the People's Republic of China.</p>

  <p>The difference is that the leadership of the Chinese CP has not only resisted the
  trend but has waged a struggle against it.</p>

  <p>The cardinal fact that emerges from the sum and substance of the dispute is that
  &mdash; the Chinese CP may be fighting the crucial battle for Socialism, which if lost
  would set the proletariat and the liberation movements of the world back for decades.
  The alternative to the present leadership and its political line &mdash; it must be
  faced squarely &mdash; is a neo-bourgeois restorationist regime. That is what really is
  at stake in the cultural revolution in China.</p>

  <h4>ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CLASS LINE</h4>

  <p>Here, in the U.S. such presumably polar opposites as The Militant, spokesman for the
  SWP, and The Worker, spokesman for the CP, find common ground in hostile attacks
  against the cultural revolution. The viewpoint from which they launch their attacks is
  not really what counts. What counts is that they lined up on the other side of the
  class line in this momentous struggle.</p>

  <p>For our part, whatever the shortcomings and however serious and profound the
  differences over the problems that are raised by the overall character of the current
  struggle, we believe that no real progressive or socialist, let alone a genuine
  Communist, can fail to give unequivocal support to the cultural revolution and the
  leadership at its head.</p>
