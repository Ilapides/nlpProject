  <h1>Class War in Tibet</h1>

  <h4>April 1959</h4>

  <p>When the Chinese Communists marched into Tibet some 10 years ago, they didn't
  attempt to overturn the ossified social and political institutions characteristic of
  this feudal, theocratic state. A military, bureaucratic overturn of social relations
  without the support of the masses has all too frequently brought results contrary to
  those desired.</p>

  <p>Take the example of some of the states of Eastern Europe, such as Hungary, where the
  Soviet army overturned the capitalist relations, without mass popular support. To this
  day these countries are standing invitations to capitalist counter-revolution.</p>

  <p>The Chinese, we believe, used sound judgment in 1950, when they simply made Tibet an
  autonomous region within the Chinese Republic. They subsequently signed an agreement
  with the Tibetan government, which gave the Chinese People's Republic control over no
  more than the foreign policy of Tibet, and the right to maintain the Chinese Army
  within its borders.</p>

  <p>And this is as it should have been. For it was patently obvious that there was no
  mass support at least none that we in the West knew of, for revolutionary socialist
  reconstruction of the country, at the time. But this rightly cautious policy of the
  Chinese, and their respect for national minorities within the framework of the Chinese
  Republic, cannot be viewed as ends in themselves regardless of all consequences.</p>

  <p>The rebellion that took place last month, and which may still be in progress, is a
  grim reminder that we are not living in the epoch of isolated states, relatively
  self-sufficient national economies and a world system, whose economic and political
  bonds are relatively loose. Imperialism long ago put an end to that.</p>

  <p>We are now living in the epoch where two social systems are in mortal combat, and
  where one or the other must emerge as victor. There can be no such thing under these
  circumstances as a "free" "independent" Tibet, removed from the arena of world
  struggle, and quietly pursuing its independent destiny.</p>

  <p>From an abstract point of view it would seem that the application of the Leninist
  slogan of self-determination for Tibet, even up to and including the right of
  separation, is the correct principle to apply. But the world struggle does not permit
  it. If U.S. imperialism can spend millions and millions of dollars in the form of the
  Seventh Fleet, with its guided missiles and A-bombs to "guard" the tiny islands Quemoy
  and Matsu, what would the U.S. do in the case of a "free" and "independent" Tibet?
  Merely to pose the question is to answer it.</p>

  <p>The correct answer to the question of Tibet we believe lies in this: that the
  Socialist rights of 650 million people involved in building a new social order are far
  greater than the bourgeois-democratic rights of an ancient, ossified, and decadent
  nobility disguised in the form of a theocracy, even though they may still command the
  greater portion of the population at this time.</p>
