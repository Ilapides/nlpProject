  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Three phases of U.S. policy toward China (June 22,
  1989)</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Three phases of U.S. policy toward China</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (June 22, 1989)</h5><em>Following are remarks from a speech by Sam
  Marcy, chairperson of Workers World Party, to a public forum on the crisis in China
  held June 10, 1989 at the Newspaper Guild in New York City. The capacity audience also
  heard from Workers World Party National Committee members Monica Moorehead and Lydia
  Bayoneta, who reviewed the long history of U.S. imperialist intervention in Asia and
  Workers World's support of the Chinese Revolution.</em>

  <p>For those of us who lived through the forties and fifties and survived, there are
  one or two outstanding domestic developments in the United States. One of them is the
  rise of McCarthyism. Most people, even at that time, assumed that its origin was of a
  domestic character. They never explained why a neofascist movement, at a time when
  there was relative capitalist prosperity, would gain big support in the ruling
  circles.</p>

  <p>The answer, which we gave at the time, is that it wasn't a domestic question which
  propelled McCarthyism. It was the Chinese revolution that scared the U.S. ruling
  class.</p>

  <p>The McCarthyites, a good section of the military, and some politicians raised the
  biggest hue and cry. Who lost China? they asked, as though they had owned it and must
  find the people responsible for losing China. It wasn't that the workers and peasants
  won the revolution. According to the McCarthyites, groups of spies in the State
  Department who were in conspiracy with the Soviet Union caused the fall of Shanghai and
  the ouster of the Chiang Kai-shek regime. Hundreds were framed up on that basis and
  thousands lost their jobs, all due to the arrogance of U.S. imperialism.</p>

  <p>The Chinese Red Army was marching and winning because it had the support of the
  workers and peasants after some 20-odd years of struggle. But this was not convincing.
  No, it was communists in the State Department, communists in the army command of the
  U.S. They even began to speak of 21 years of treason, which included the Truman
  administration.</p>

  <h4>Debacle in Korea</h4>

  <p>But finally the debacle of the U.S. armies in Korea forced a reconsideration of that
  thesis. What's important is that this unusual chapter in the domestic history of the
  United States was almost exclusively the result of a foreign affairs issue. The
  liberals who now write about McCarthyism and the persecution don't touch the
  fundamental question: that it was an attempt by sections of the ruling class and some
  of the army to launch a war against China in order to retake it for U.S. imperialist
  purposes. The Korean war looked like the beginning, but it got stalled by the heroic
  defense of the Korean people, the supplementary assistance of the Chinese Red Army,
  which intervened after MacArthur threatened to cross the Yalu River, and the Soviet
  Union's help with military equipment.</p>

  <p>They couldn't believe it was a revolution. They had to say, who lost it? They never
  could admit that the great Russian Revolution was a reality either. It was only
  temporary. The Bolsheviks would be overthrown. And the same with the Chinese Communist
  Party.</p>

  <p>To develop an overall strategic approach to what's happening today you've got to
  take a look at the orientation of U.S. monopoly capitalism and its political leaders.
  What are they doing? If they had a hands-off policy toward China and the rest of the
  world, that would be one thing. But they are for intervention everywhere.</p>

  <p>That chapter in the history of this country did a lot of damage to the progressive
  movement and eventually destroyed the most militant sections of the labor movement,
  especially those who espoused Marxism and Leninism. But the roots of McCarthyism were
  deep in the heart of China, which the monopoly capitalists looked upon as a fabulous
  market with endless possibilities.</p>

  <p>It took the military might of the Korean people and the PLA and the support of other
  socialist countries to finally bring about the truce. To this day the U.S. hangs on
  with 40,000 troops and god knows how many atomic bombs aimed at China, Korea and the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>Then came another chapter in U.S. history so far as China was concerned. Having lost
  this violent attempt to regain China, after bulldozing all of Asia and mesmerizing the
  population in this country on the basis of lies and slanders and red-baiting, they
  tried another tactic. It was the same strategic orientation, but tactically it was
  different.</p>

  <p>If you watched TV, as I've been forced to do this week, with the commentators and
  think-tankers and so on, there was one face missing and that was Richard Nixon's. I
  haven't seen him. Kissinger was on once. I haven't seen Eagleburger, either, who's glad
  that he's in Latin America somewhere. The youngest practitioner from this group of
  imperialist geopolitical strategists, Winston Lord, had to take the brunt of it
  all.</p>

  <h4>The Nixon maneuver</h4>

  <p>Now, who are these people? Late in the sixties they decided that the best way to win
  China back to the U.S. was to carry out a complex maneuver to finally recognize China,
  but to do it in such a way as to hurt the Soviet Union. By the way, almost two-thirds
  of the UN had voted for admitting China but several of the imperialist countries really
  controlled the UN and they had said no.</p>

  <p>So the U.S. tried the Nixon maneuver (really the Rockefeller maneuver). Its chief
  practitioner was Henry Kissinger. It was the soft cop approach, which may sound crude
  but it's approximately correct. They would slowly and gradually penetrate the Chinese
  economy, make all sorts of deals, grant some technology, win them on the basis of the
  soft sell. Some concessions were good for China, some deals were helpful. China broke
  out of isolation. But overall, the fundamental strategy was to obtain the same
  objective that the McCarthyites and the military had tried to win by forceful
  means.</p>

  <h4>Walter Lippmann's prescription for China</h4>

  <p>Walter Lippmann was at that time considered the dean of the syndicated columnists
  and a foreign policy specialist. He had the ear of the State Department, the White
  House and the Pentagon. To see how he was regarded, in 1961 he was on a plane to Moscow
  to obtain an interview with Khrushchev. Suddenly the Soviet ambassador handed him a
  note saying that Khrushchev wanted the interview postponed for a week. Lippmann wrote
  back, "It's impossible for me to do that." And Khrushchev changed his mind. This was
  because Walter Lippmann represented the U.S. government. That's how significant his
  writings were in that period.</p>

  <p>Lippmann gave an interview to the New York Times on Sept. 4, 1969, in which he was
  asked about China. He said, "I think China is obviously too big to be governed as one
  central state." You could say, well, that's an opinion and who cares what he said? But
  that's the opinion of a good part of the government, of the think tanks and the
  military. China is too big. They want to divide it up. It is a brutally frank statement
  of the orientation of U.S. imperialism.</p>

  <p>The view that the U.S. is a peace-loving nation merely attempting to find good
  customers here and there, letting the capitalist market work, is a false conception.
  They put the military and economic strangulation to work. This explains the rage that
  the U.S. capitalist press is now in.</p>

  <p>The Nixon-Kissinger maneuver, which has lasted for 17 years, is now in question in
  the minds of the bourgeoisie. They are saying, look, this great strategy is not
  working. Nixon, Kissinger, Eagleburger and some of the others are not around at this
  particular moment or are keeping a low profile because they know that.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the media are giving a high profile to the supreme racist and
  arch-warmonger Jesse Helms. And he is in the company of a fraudulent liberal from the
  Brooklyn area, Stephen Solarz. Brooklyn, which he misrepresents as a constituency, is
  supposed to have been the heart of liberalism. It indicates to us that there's a united
  front in the ruling class against the Chinese Revolution.</p>

  <p>But we must also look at the internal situation in China, for after all it is the
  internal situation that in the long run will matter.</p>

  <p>For a long time, Marxism had seemed to be situated in the West, and partly in
  Russia, although few recognized that as a great center of Marxism. But after the
  Russian Revolution, another center of Marxism grew up. It is thought that the Chinese
  leadership merely followed the Soviet Union, but over the many years when the Red Army
  fought the pro-imperialist forces of Chiang Kai-shek and Japan, it also built up cadres
  eager in the study of Marxism.</p>

  <p>I think it was Trotsky who once said that in the East they lacked in development of
  technology and sciences, but were ahead of the West in the science of Marxism. That was
  a very important observation. They eagerly grappled with Marxism as a science and
  developed it for the purposes of the socialist revolution. The revolution was a very
  profound one, with great experiences in the class struggle. There were defeats and
  victories. They trained a generation of revolutionary thinkers who could grapple with
  the most fundamental questions.</p>

  <p>And the revolution did succeed. All attempts to overturn it, as the McCarthyites
  wanted, failed. Having been victorious, the Chinese Revolution then had to go much
  further. It had to go towards reconstruction, building socialism in this vast
  undeveloped country. That's the question of questions, and it is still urgent today.
  How do we bring about socialism?</p>

  <h4>Two views of how to build socialism</h4>

  <p>Two tendencies developed in the struggle. One group thought China, considering its
  undeveloped industry and technology, had to go through a period of capitalist
  development. Concessions had to be made to the bourgeoisie which still existed. And
  others thought that the road to socialism lay in the continuation of the struggle
  against the remnants of the landlords and the bourgeoisie. It was Mao Zedong who led
  the latter tendency. It was Liu Shao-chi and Deng Xiaoping who led the first
  tendency.</p>

  <p>This struggle between the so-called pragmatists and the hardliners is not new. It
  began in the Soviet Union in the early twenties over what to do in an undeveloped
  country that needs equipment and know-how from the West. Lenin himself inaugurated the
  New Economic Policy. Was it like the one that Deng and the others were pursuing?
  Perhaps, but in Lenin's writing he said, we are making a temporary retreat of a
  strategic character to see if we can win something from the bourgeois elements in order
  to fortify and strengthen the revolutionary aspirations of the working class and the
  poor peasantry.</p>

  <p>It was clear that the New Economic Policy could not continue very long. The
  bourgeoisie was ready and willing to take all the concessions but not at all willing to
  accommodate itself to the socialist objectives of the proletarian dictatorship. Now,
  you can blame everything on Stalin and say that Stalin ruthlessly collectivized
  agriculture and therefore set everything back, as he did, but that's only half the
  story. The other half is that the bourgeoisie did not want to go along with the New
  Economic Policy. They wanted it for their purposes, for capitalism, not socialism.
  Lenin kept saying over and over again, in this struggle, who will conquer who?</p>

  <p>Lenin did one thing not done by the current leaders in China. He called things by
  their right name. He said, we are beating a retreat and reintroducing forms of
  capitalism that will help us. But they did not help for long.</p>

  <p>If the New Economic Policy that Lenin introduced had worked splendidly for
  socialism, Stalin and Bukharin and Trotsky and the others would not have been
  dissatisfied with it. The entire leadership was dissatisfied with what was happening in
  the country as the result of the prolongation of the New Economic Policy, that is, of
  concessions to the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>This happened decades ago, back in '21 and '22, but it's a live issue in the entire
  socialist movement. It's a live issue in the Soviet Union, in Poland, in
  Czechoslovakia, wherever a working class government takes over from a not fully
  developed capitalist society.</p>

  <p>What is the basic issue in China? Here we have fought, the workers can say, to build
  socialism. We have tried both ways. We have tried an extreme, radical program and it
  got overthrown by the rightists. At the beginning after the People's Republic was
  formed, we tried a moderate course.</p>

  <p>We can't deal with all the lies of the capitalist press, but when the People's
  Republic was established, they had a moderate program of buying out some of the
  capitalists, making it easier for them to accommodate themselves to socialism. There
  was a period when most liberals in this country supported the Chinese People's Republic
  because they said it was going easy on the population. They began to contrast China to
  Stalin's regime, as they called it, of horror and so on. That they were more
  humane.</p>

  <p>But the revolution is as humane as it possibly can be in all these countries. It was
  the Chinese bourgeois elements who didn't want to cooperate. They were the ones who
  disrupted socialist projects. The first thing to recognize is that if you give the
  bourgeoisie freedom of speech, you think they'll be satisfied? And that's all? That is
  not true. You have to have an irreversible socialist foundation and political structure
  for that.</p>

  <p>The same fundamental question that the USSR faced in the twenties and the thirties,
  how to deal with the leftover bourgeoisie in both agriculture and in industry, was
  faced in China under more difficult conditions. They started off on a moderate course,
  but it didn't work. The world bourgeoisie was not impressed. They said, You do more for
  us, open up the ports, open up for investments.</p>

  <h4>Essence of right-left struggle</h4>

  <p>This question of how to deal with alien class elements is the quintessence of the
  struggle between right and left. I think the term hardliner is wrong from a Marxist
  point of view. It's a struggle between left and right tendencies. Occasionally, there
  are ultra-left tendencies, and there are ultra-right tendencies, but in general there
  are two fundamental lines of development for China on how to proceed.</p>

  <p>Some innovations tried by the government did not succeed, like having open-hearth
  furnaces in the backyard. Had it succeeded, it would have been a world-shaking
  development. It would have meant a whole new steel industry in a short time made by the
  workers themselves virtually in their backyards. But it didn't work out. It was not a
  costly maneuver, but it could be taken advantage of by the rightwing to show that these
  innovations of the leftwing were not successful and they needed to go back to the
  period of capitalist development.</p>

  <p>All the struggles in China turned around the issue of how to deal with the
  peasantry, whether to communize it or whether to bring back private property. The
  communes were successful. Remember, China was able to hold out and grow stronger in the
  period when the government was stable. They were able to rally the support of the
  oppressed masses worldwide and even sections of the Western working class.</p>

  <p>We are faced not with some sort of incidental or accidental division in the Party
  between old and young. It's true that the present group are mostly the older people and
  that they have a record of revolutionary struggle dating back over many years. But it
  is also true that precisely because they are older people, they may not last long, and
  that will open up a new road.</p>

  <p>Is it possible for a developing country to adopt a constitutional form of struggle
  in which two divergent tendencies, both of which have deep roots in the country,
  alternate in the government according to democratic measures? No, it is not possible if
  the class struggle is still alive and strong and a vibrant force. Serious struggle
  comes because of a divergence of material and economic interests between social
  groupings and classes. The existence of serious struggle, of bloody struggle, over a
  period of time signifies that there is a class basis for it.</p>

  <p>When there is not enough, when the economic foundation is not yet sufficiently built
  up to supply the needs of the masses, it is not probable that there will be agreement
  without a bitter struggle in which one of the factions gets booted out and another
  faction comes in.</p>

  <p>The imperialist bourgeoisie had a 200-year economic and technological lead over the
  East &mdash; Poland, China, Africa, parts of Asia and Latin America. To overcome that
  lead is not possible by mere constitutional means.</p>

  <h4>The secret of bourgeois democracy</h4>

  <p>I mentioned Britain earlier. Britain, one of the oldest capitalist countries, has a
  solid class structure of exploitation &mdash; the police, the military, all of its
  institutions are bourgeois. The Parliament and the monarchy are bourgeois. They have
  two parties, the Conservatives and the Labor Party, but the Labor Party is a bourgeois
  party. It is not a revolutionary threat to the state, that is, to the class structure.
  It is a governing opponent of the Conservative Party. When the Conservatives go out,
  the Labor Party comes in. But the Labor Party does not bring about socialism, it does
  not even seriously try. It is understood by both parties that the class structure
  remains as is. The secret of their democracy is the super-exploitation of the colonies,
  which nurtured an aristocracy of labor and opportunism at home.</p>

  <p>It's different in a revolutionary socialist republic where the question of the class
  structure has not been finally resolved. The old bourgeoisie is gone, the landlords,
  the old feudal institutions, but it takes much more time and economic wealth to build
  up the foundations on which the common ownership of the means of production rests. So
  solid must it be that the political leaders can say to themselves that whoever gets in,
  the rightwing or the leftwing, the socialist foundations remain. There will only be
  tactical changes, only reforms of a socialist character. If the left gets in, they will
  make certain socialist reforms, if the right gets in they will push it back a little,
  but the foundation as a socialist state is not in question, not in danger. At that time
  there can be two different parties in open, democratic discussion to see which one gets
  elected.</p>

  <p>But that cannot be done in this period when the socialist foundations are not secure
  enough, as witness the hundreds of minor rebellions and eruptions which have a class
  character. Suppose that two socialist parties are in opposition to each other to win a
  parliamentary election, let us say in China. If it is a serious struggle, the
  imperialist bourgeoisie moves in, supporting one group wholly and entirely, even
  financing it. How can there be democracy of a socialist character under these
  circumstances? It cannot be done.</p>

  <p>Capitalist democracy is a fraud. They only practice it as long as the capitalist
  foundations are secure. If there is a real threat of socialism, they call out not only
  the police and the militia but the army. In 1926 there was a threat to the social
  foundations of the rotting imperialist system in Britain, a general strike, and what
  happened? Churchill called out the army and crushed it. He didn't say, well, you're
  entitled to your democratic rights and therefore we'll allow the general strike to
  continue although it's a revolutionary threat to the capitalist system.</p>

  <p>The best that we can hope for under the present circumstances is that the leftwing
  will win out. That is very important for the struggle. Once it has reached the military
  stage, you must admit, it is a serious bourgeois opposition and the U.S. government
  will support it hook, line and sinker. So will Britain, France and Japan.</p>

  <p>But after 17 years in which the Nixon administration, along with Kissinger and all
  the others, have attempted to build a bridge to China for imperialist penetration, it
  seems for the moment to have collapsed. And this is good for China and for the working
  class of the world.</p>

  <h4>Time to reconsider strategy</h4>

  <p>We are not against having peaceful economic relations with the Western imperialists.
  We are not for the self-isolation of China. What is necessary is to slowly reconsider
  the strategy that has been pursued since 1978. It is very necessary to go over the list
  and say: "We have dealt with imperialism for so many years now; let's add it all up and
  see where it has brought us. We have allowed the native bourgeois elements to thrive
  and grow strong, to become impudent and insolent and to challenge us for power. We have
  allowed them all that and weakened our position. This not only infects the intellectual
  community, it will spread out to the workers &mdash; and to some extent has done so.
  Before long it will have some effect on the peasantry. It's time to rethink the
  strategy."</p>

  <p>Now, we want to support the People's Republic of China in its struggle against the
  counterrevolution. But we will do them a disservice if we do not at the same time speak
  out and say what was wrong. But in a responsible way, in such a way as not to give aid
  and comfort to the counterrevolution or the imperialist bourgeoisie and the hangers-on,
  including the radicals who have become silenced, cowed down, fearful even of a
  fraudulent pro-democracy press campaign. What will happen when there's not just a press
  campaign but a military campaign? You can imagine.</p>

  <p>It's the leaders' policies that have brought inflation, that have created the whole
  yuppie generation, who are mostly the sons and daughters of the bureaucrats. So under
  these very difficult conditions, they must solve the problem of what to do next.
  Anybody who criticizes must have a program. What good is it to say you're against
  repression but fail to ask what is the class character of the student movement? Is it
  bourgeois, is it pro-imperialist or is it a socialist movement? It is a pro-imperialist
  bourgeois movement and a very serious threat, and the question for the government is
  how to repair the situation.</p>

  <p>It may be necessary for the government at the present time to say they will continue
  the reforms and strengthen them. You can't just stop all of a sudden and turn it all
  around. As an example, China has contracts to purchase wheat in the U.S. It so happens
  that the U.S. is very anxious to sell because if they don't, China will buy it from
  Argentina, Australia and Canada, even Europe. The U.S. learned that, when the grain
  embargo was imposed by the Carter administration against the Soviet Union, it didn't
  work; it did more harm to the farmers here.</p>

  <p>China also floated certain bonds on the bond market in Europe. They start to fall.
  Interest payments become due on certain bonds. You can't stop the joint ventures all of
  a sudden. There are contracts involved, there's money invested by China. You can't just
  turn it all back. It has to be done carefully.</p>

  <p>There are innumerable problems arising at the present time. The counterrevolutionary
  forces have destroyed a good part of the transportation system in Beijing, Shanghai,
  Canton and other areas. Disruption for several days is one thing; this has been going
  on for weeks, and the struggle has been building up for months.</p>

  <p>The problem too is how to win back a good many of the students and the
  intellectuals. There are a host of problems, but the worst problem would be if the
  bourgeois elements won out. That would be the biggest bloodbath in history. It would
  put to shame the bloodbath in Indonesia in 1965-66.</p>

  <h4>Class character of the opposition</h4>

  <p>The imperialist media has misled the public on the nature of this bourgeois
  opposition, as though they are a few innocent young students. It's not true. They are
  serious elements. You know that in a socialist country like China, if the revolution
  had at its disposal all the means to educate the masses, the student body would be
  composed overwhelmingly of peasants and workers. But precisely because the rightwing
  got the upper hand, the student body is composed more of the privileged groupings in
  China and very much less of the peasants and workers.</p>

  <p>When you send students into a foreign country, they become contacts of the foreign
  country. They are sending them to the richest country in the world, and they're coming
  from one of the poorest ones. It is very likely they'll have to be more select on who
  they send over here.</p>

  <p>Contact with the students is only one thing. Take contact with the military. One of
  the first things that happened under the Bush administration was to strengthen contacts
  between the military of the U.S. and the military of China. It's all a question of how
  to get around the Chinese people so that the U.S. military can ingratiate itself with
  the PLA. It's a struggle, see. It's a way of winning over the military. They fought
  China for 20 years. Now they want to win them over on the basis of little maneuvers,
  being nice to the officers, showing them a new type of plane or taking them on an
  aircraft carrier.</p>

  <p>There's a general retreat in most of the socialist countries, with the exception of
  Cuba, Korea and the German Democratic Republic (I really don't want to hazard an
  opinion on where each will stand on China). It's important to realize that it's a
  retreat and not to call it something else, not to call it a revolutionary restructuring
  of society that will bring socialism. It's a retreat to capitalist methods, to private
  enterprise, and it is also conciliatory to imperialism on an international scale.</p>

  <p>Now, all this could be a maneuver, and it would be very fortunate for humanity if it
  were a maneuver, you know, a tactic agreed upon by the leadership that could change the
  next day. That was possible during the Stalin period but is not possible at the present
  time. The ones who took over in the Soviet Union are committed to the reforms on the
  basis of conviction. Their convictions will be proven to be based on erroneous
  conceptions.</p>

  <p>This retreat did not come about yesterday. And while the capitalist press here are
  still praising it, they are getting the message that the workers in Hungary, Poland and
  above all the USSR are going to see the reforms for what they are, capitalist tactics
  that are used not to bring about a better, more fruitful economic wellbeing, raising
  the social standards of the masses. No, it is a backward step.</p>

  <h4>A world historic development</h4>

  <p>I believe that the China development is of world historic significance because it is
  bound to make the leaders in the Soviet Union think again, it will make them think in
  Hungary, Poland and everywhere.</p>

  <p>So what we are looking forward to, which we might not have been able to say three or
  four months ago, is a revolutionary renaissance in the world socialist community. This
  retreat is going to end. It is becoming discredited.</p>

  <p>A revolutionary policy is bound to emerge in China, but it won't come quickly. We
  first will have to see how far the counterrevolution got. And, if it is done legally,
  there will have to be a Party congress where this is discussed. If they are in a
  position to, I think the congress should be opened up and the discussion should be not
  merely about what happened in Tiananmen Square and the repression, but the basic issues
  that are involved. After all, two general secretaries of the party supported, in one
  way or another, the student movement which turned into a counterrevolutionary movement.
  It's not because of lack of personal characteristics alone, it's because of objective
  conditions.</p>

  <p>These are the result of the penetration of capital in the port cities, the joint
  ventures, private enterprise, desettlement in the rural areas. All this has to be
  reviewed in the light of planning for the future without depending once again on the
  capitalist sector. Inflation grew, corruption and unemployment grew even at a time of a
  worldwide capitalist boom.</p>

  <p>This is bound to end. A new collapse of the capitalist system will vitally affect
  all of the world's oppressed. It will give renewed confidence to all who are fighting.
  The entire national liberation movement everywhere has viewed the reforms as something
  not in the interest of the world struggle against imperialism. It's a negative
  factor.</p>

  <p>A return to revolutionary Marxism, a return to a thoroughgoing anti-imperialist
  policy, to join the forces of the socialist world into a commonwealth and tighten the
  reins of friendship, that is what is needed. This policy that everybody is independent,
  meaning that everybody in the socialist countries should collaborate with the West,
  deprives them of autonomy to deal on a coordinated socialist basis. If all the
  socialist countries are united, not necessarily in an ironclad way but on the basis of
  economic need in relation to imperialism, they have sufficient forces to rally the
  masses to build socialism with greater enthusiasm than what is being done in the port
  city of Shanghai as a result of the invasion of foreign capital.</p>

  <p>Let us make this very clear. We are not calling for the scuttling of all that China
  has entered into. That would be injurious. But to slowly phase it out, as did the
  Soviet Union during the NEP period. The so-called prosperous sections have been only in
  a very narrow area of China compared to its huge population. A common effort to
  reignite revolutionary enthusiasm will do more than anything else to shake up the world
  as China did once before.</p>

  <p>In his book <em>China Shakes the World,</em> Jack Belden showed what the masses were
  doing in China. This is another opportunity. China will shake it up again, but in a
  thoroughgoing revolutionary way in the interests not only of the Chinese Revolution but
  in the interests of the world revolution.</p>
