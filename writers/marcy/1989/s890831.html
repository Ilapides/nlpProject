  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: The setback in Poland (Aug. 31, 1989)</title>

<body>
  <h1>The setback in Poland</h1>

  <h2>Its causes and consequences</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Aug. 31, 1989)</h5>

  <p>Of all the modern forms of servitude, none is more humiliating or in the final
  analysis crueler than national indebtedness to a hostile foreign power.</p>

  <p>It is particularly dangerous for a nation which only after World War II achieved a
  fragile form of independence. National indebtedness is a road that leads to ruin. It
  has a long, long history dating back many centuries.</p>

  <p>In ancient times, it was easy to recognize the naked tyranny of a Caesar. It was
  quite another matter to understand that Croesus &mdash; the symbol of wealth and usury
  &mdash; was as merciless and oppressive as any Caesar.</p>

  <p>"The class struggles of the ancient world," said Marx in the first volume of
  <em>Capital,</em> "took the form chiefly of a contest between debtors and creditors."
  That struggle lasted for centuries. It ended, as Marx says, "in the ruin of the
  plebeian debtors. They were displaced by slaves." (Progress Publishers, p. 135.)</p>

  <p>If there is any one single cause of the setback for socialism in Poland, it is the
  magnitude of Poland's wholesale indebtedness to the imperialist creditor countries.</p>

  <p>Of course, it is not the indebtedness alone that has allowed the hitherto
  counterrevolutionary Solidarity movement to become the governing group. But the
  indebtedness is the summation of all the domestic and international problems which
  Poland has faced and which arise out of an entire historical period.</p>

  <h4>Threat from bankers</h4>

  <p>It is easy enough to recognize the threat from the U.S. when the Pentagon dispatches
  a naval armada into the Mediterranean or the Caribbean. The oppression is less
  understood when international bankers arbitrarily cut off credit or impose an embargo
  on imports from an indebted country. Only last week we saw, not the invasion of a naval
  armada, but the spectacle of hordes of International Monetary Fund officials, bankers,
  brokers, foreign exchange speculators, and finally huge delegations from the U.S.
  Congress descend upon Warsaw to greet the new governing group in Poland.</p>

  <p>As a country that was oppressed for centuries, Poland's long struggle for
  sovereignty and national pride was recognized all over the world. More than a century
  ago, it attracted the greatest attention from the progressive and democratic forces,
  and none were more in the forefront of the struggle in Europe for the independence of
  Poland than Marx and Engels.</p>

  <p>Today there is great celebration in Poland that "freedom" has been achieved with the
  appointment of a Solidarity adviser as prime minister. But the real celebrations are
  taking place in the dining halls and palaces of the financial oligarchies of Wall
  Street, Lombard Street, Frankfurt and the Bourse. They now have complete political and
  economic domination over Poland.</p>

  <p>Of course, for some time knowledgeable circles of imperialist finance saw the Polish
  economy as securely in the hands of the IMF and the bankers of the U.S., Britain,
  France and West Germany. But it was on Aug. 17 that the financial oligarchies completed
  their <strong>political</strong> domination of Poland. On that day General Wojciech
  Jaruzelski, a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers Party (PUWP)
  and president of Poland, nominated Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a cohort of Lech Walesa, to be
  prime minister. This meant that both the economic and political levers were now in the
  hands of the bankers.</p>

  <p>It is indeed a shocking development and a cause for the deepest concern in all the
  progressive, working class and communist parties all over the world.</p>

  <p>For advanced and class-conscious workers, and for communists in particular, it is
  most important to clarify the situation, to explain why it has happened and not accept
  the bourgeois interpretation.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this is made much more difficult by the confusion in the
  international communist movement, especially by the role of the bourgeois reformers in
  the Soviet Union, as well as that of the Polish communist leaders over a period of
  time.</p>

  <p>If there is any political party in Poland that should have understood how to avoid
  the peril of becoming enslaved to the oppressing imperialist powers, it seems to us it
  should have been the Polish communists &mdash; because of their long tradition of
  Marxist education, their exposure to the experiences of other countries, and most of
  all the history of their own country with its struggle between the landlords and the
  peasants, the workers and the capitalists.</p>

  <p>And yet they have succumbed to what must have seemed a tempting solution to the
  grave problem of dealing with a bourgeois opposition whose principal support was the
  Western imperialist bourgeoisie. This opposition, which prevented an orderly
  development of socialist construction, arose in 1956 as a consequence of the Poznan
  insurrection. In one form or another it has continued and grown.</p>

  <p>Evidently the party could not foresee that a mere debtor-creditor relationship with
  international finance capital, particularly in a period of so-called capitalist
  prosperity, could turn out to be their complete undoing, both as a progressive working
  class force and as a builder of socialist construction.</p>

  <p>However, as Marx explained, the debtor-creditor relationship in ancient times ended
  up in "the ruin of the plebeian debtors" and in the Middle Ages with "the ruin of the
  feudal debtors who lost their political power together with the economic basis on which
  it was established."</p>

  <h4>Usurers and medieval lords</h4>

  <p>Polish communists could also learn from the history of the struggle between the
  Polish feudal lords and the usurers, with whom they were constantly in conflict.</p>

  <p>In Poland, the feudal lords employed Jews not only as financial advisers but also as
  managers of the large estates. The latter often proposed austerity measures which the
  feudal lords were eager to palm off on the peasants. The easiest way out was to blame
  the usurers and to instigate pogroms in the villages against the Jewish community
  &mdash; not, of course, against the financial advisers and the managers of the huge
  estates, and certainly not against the lords themselves. What seems to have been an
  endemic anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe had its origin in this relationship.</p>

  <p>Just as the medieval lords and the church steered the anger of the peasants away
  from their oppressors and turned it against the Jewish villagers, so today the
  bourgeois elements and the church have steered the mass anger over price increases and
  hardships away from its real causes, the indebtedness, and turned it against the
  communists.</p>

  <h4>The insurrection of 1956</h4>

  <p>The insurrection of 1956 posed the problem in the starkest form possible of how to
  deal with a bourgeois opposition which, although formidable because of support from the
  reactionary Catholic hierarchy and its imperialist connections, was nevertheless
  manageable from the viewpoint of revolutionary Marxist strategy. After all, the levers
  of power were all in the hands of the government and the party.</p>

  <p>While the recalcitrance of the bourgeois opposition made socialist construction
  difficult, this was not insurmountable. The opposition lent itself to being gradually
  disintegrated once the party and the government took an undeviating course toward
  socialist construction.</p>

  <p>Even as late as the middle sixties, Poland had risen from the ashes of the Nazi
  assault and was rapidly becoming a middle-sized, modern industrial country &mdash; the
  tenth industrial power in the world.</p>

  <p>However, instead of taking a class position in relation to the building of
  socialism, the party instead sought an easier road, one that apparently intended to
  avoid a collision course with the bourgeois opposition and at the same time to
  strengthen socialist construction. This road was to borrow heavily from the West, which
  presumably would open its arms to Polish exports while extending billions of dollars of
  credit to smooth the road for the purchase of technology.</p>

  <p>As the communists should have known a long time ago, the result was to tie
  themselves to the chariot wheel of international finance capital.</p>

  <p>The amount of detailed information that the banks demand is on such a vast scale as
  to make almost superfluous the various imperialist intelligence agencies that do
  investigative work for political purposes. The banks demand not only written statements
  but also long and exhaustive interviews with key economic officials, from whom they
  elicit all kinds of information which operates to deprive the borrowing country of its
  economic and political autonomy.</p>

  <p>In the seventies, this went so far that on Jan. 26, 1979, the New York Times carried
  a front-page story which proclaimed that the Western imperialist banks were virtually
  controlling the Polish economy. Entitled "Poland, in Bid for Loan, Will Let West's
  Banks Monitor Economy," the article said:</p>

  <p>"As part of an effort to obtain a major new loan, Poland has agreed to permit
  Western banks to monitor its economic policies, American bankers say. They regard the
  concession as a historic breakthrough in financial relations with the Communist world.
  ...</p>

  <p>"To persuade the banks to agree to the financing, Poland has already had to announce
  a strict new budget for 1979 and provide its creditors with comprehensive new
  information on its financial situation.</p>

  <p>"Moreover, the banks involved in the new credit will henceforth track the progress
  of the Polish economy, much as the International Monetary Fund monitors the economies
  of non-Communist countries in financial distress."</p>

  <p>The progressive and working class movement and the socialist countries gave this
  development very little attention, if any. Actually, this was a signal to the bourgeois
  opposition in Poland to commence broad political activity to destabilize the country
  until a leadership was established suitable to the banks. It was soon thereafter that
  the Solidarity-led strikes began which were deliberately designed to move the crisis
  from the economic to the political arena.</p>

  <p>By the late seventies, Poland was already a country more or less divided
  economically between the private sector, which was growing relentlessly, and the
  socialized sector. One was in combat with the other in a ceaseless, merciless war. The
  tragedy is that successive Communist administrations refused to deal with this acute
  contradiction, the burden of which fell squarely upon the workers.</p>

  <p>For a while it seemed that there was only one certain solution, and that was to
  resort to the capital markets of Western imperialist finance.</p>

  <p>But by the eighties, the magnitude of the problem was becoming clear. Here's what
  the "Theses of the Central Committee of the PUWP for the Tenth Congress of the Party"
  said in March 1986:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Relations with the developed capitalist countries depend in a considerable degree on
    solving the problem of our external debt. It amounts to 30 billion dollars. Its
    character is complex. Its main part accumulated in the seventies. Since the beginning
    of the 1980s, the debt increased because of accumulated interest resulting in a large
    degree from the policy of high interest rates imposed by some capitalist countries.
    The situation deteriorated due to restrictions imposed on Poland and maintained,
    which cost our country more than 15 billion dollars and obstructed development of our
    economy, export, reduction of indebtedness.
  </blockquote>The government tried to change course.

  <blockquote>
    We made a tremendous effort diametrically changing proportion between import from and
    export to those countries. Over the past decade import surplus over export, totalling
    annually almost two billion zlotys, increased income for distribution. At present,
    our imports are more than a billion dollars worth less than exports. Only for that
    reason we have nearly three billion dollars yearly less for distribution than in the
    1970s. ...

    <p>We hold the opinion that debt servicing cannot be carried out excessively, at the
    expense of economic development, reduction of the standard of living. It is possible
    only under conditions of production growth and export development. Materialization of
    this requires understanding and realistic cooperation on the part of creditor
    countries, restoration of normal finance-credit relations by them, giving up of all
    form of restrictions and obstructions for development of mutual cooperation on the
    part of some states. [Pages 27-28.]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Asking for "understanding and realistic cooperation" from finance capital is like
  asking tigers to become vegetarians.</p>

  <p>There is nothing as significant for understanding the Polish situation as the
  relationship of the Polish indebtedness to the imperialist banks. When the post-war
  rebuilding of the economy was started in Poland, it was oriented toward a socialist
  society. Whether one regards the rate of development as slow or fast, one thing is
  incontrovertible. Poland was regarded as moving in the direction of becoming a
  developed industrial country. But what is it now?</p>

  <p>Now it has the international status of a Third World (neocolonialist) country, very
  much analogous to that of Argentina, Brazil or Mexico.</p>

  <p>When Jaruzelski took over, declared martial law and arrested some figures from
  Solidarity, it was not really an effort to stamp out the bourgeois opposition, merely
  to intimidate them. The Polish government did not try to reverse the economic
  concessions that had been granted to the bourgeois opposition or to repudiate the debts
  to the imperialist banks. It didn't even suspend them or reduce the interest. The
  reality is that it left the situation as before, encouraging the bourgeoisie to
  continue their work of sabotage.</p>

  <p>Solidarity instigated absenteeism to sabotage the economy. It became a maxim in
  Poland that workers pretend to work, managers pretend to pay wages. All this
  destabilized the party and developed a sense of cynicism. The reality was no one knew
  where they stood any more. On the surface, Jaruzelski had a strong hand. In reality, he
  was disintegrating the influence of the party.</p>

  <p>The constant shuffling and reshuffling of economic advisers and technicians was in
  itself enough to cause deep concern and leave the rank-and-file communists completely
  at sea. Galloping inflation and shortages were grist to the mill of the bourgeois
  opposition, while the hardship was greatest on the workers. Demoralization was the
  predictable result.</p>

  <p>It doesn't matter now whether there are communists in the Cabinet or not. It's no
  answer to say that the military and police are in the hands of Jaruzelski. That might
  be significant in the event of a violent attempt at counter-revolution, but is of no
  help in rallying the masses to the cause of socialism at a time when the economic
  structure is pulling in a capitalist direction.</p>

  <p>The Jaruzelski regime is a classical example of a Bonapartist dictatorship, a regime
  that tries to conciliate irreconcilable class forces. More than that, it has tried to
  reconcile two diametrically opposed social systems, the system of socialized industry
  and the basic means of production, versus the private or bourgeois sector of the Polish
  economy.</p>

  <p>By relieving himself of the chairmanship of the Party and taking over the presidency
  under the new constitutional system, Jaruzelski elevates himself to the role of an
  arbiter between the classes.</p>

  <p>Looking at in traditional terms of capitalist development, one might think that
  Solidarity, representing the trade unions, therefore represents the working class.
  That's what many of the workers believe and that has to be taken into account.</p>

  <p>But the reality of the situation is that the Solidarity leadership is an
  imperialist-inspired, -engineered and bought leadership that is as subservient and
  servile to the interests of U.S. imperialism as any neocolonialist bourgeois
  leadership.</p>

  <p>There is a difference, however, between the IMF treatment of the governing groups of
  Argentina, Mexico or Nigeria, and the way it conducts itself with the governing group
  in Poland.</p>

  <p>In the oppressed Third World countries, the U.S. and the IMF in particular are
  exceptionally careful when imposing harsh demands on the debtor countries not to
  provoke massive working class resistance, for fear it will lead to the overthrow of the
  neocolonialist leadership and a socialist revolution. In Poland, however, their whole
  policy has been to encourage resistance to the leadership, including sabotage and
  subversion of the economy.</p>

  <p>Is it possible for a right-wing bourgeois party to take over the Polish economy and
  leave the socialized sector intact?</p>

  <p>Some might think that there is a kind of reverse historical precedent for this. In a
  number of capitalist countries &mdash; Britain, France, Greece and Spain, for example
  &mdash; socialist parties have taken over the reins of government and left the property
  relations intact. True, they nationalized some industries. But the bourgeoisie was
  compensated for any purchases the state made of the means of production. So that the
  basic relationship between workers and bosses remained the same.</p>

  <p>However, there are vast differences between social democratic parties taking over
  the reins of power in capitalist countries and an anti-communist, bourgeois grouping
  taking over in a socialist, or workers' state, as it is often called. The differences
  are deep and profound.</p>

  <p>The socialists who took over had no intention of expropriating the means of
  production. While they are socialists in name, they are actually bourgeois parties that
  historically have won the allegiance of the workers. Nowhere, not even after the 1945
  election which brought the Labor Party to power in Britain, was there a suggestion of
  expropriating the bourgeoisie and eliminating them as a class. The bourgeois order was
  to remain.</p>

  <p>Is there an analogy to Poland? Are the CP leaders rationalizing that perhaps an
  anti-communist governing group will go no further than the social democrats in changing
  the relations of production, and will be restrained by the considerable influence of
  the Communist Party (PUWP) and its allies?</p>

  <p>Do they think that the bankers and industrialists who have burdened the country to
  an almost unendurable extent and brought about inflation and economic dislocation will
  be any more generous with Solidarity?</p>

  <p>Or will Solidarity try to sell off the means of production to the bankers to whom
  the country is mortgaged? Does the state have the authority to sell them? Is that not
  unconstitutional?</p>

  <p>The imperialist bourgeoisie want a soft landing. They're relying on evolutionary
  processes to continue to discredit the communist officialdom and the socialist
  achievements, and reduce the country to small-scale production. Where the means of
  production are clearly in the hands of the banks, they can of course pour in billions
  to develop industry for export, as in south Korea. However, all of this requires new
  funding by the imperialist banks, which are fearful of extending themselves too far
  under the Polish conditions.</p>

  <h4>Bush and the CIA</h4>

  <p>The Bush administration, following the line of its predecessors, Democrats and
  Republicans, wants to cultivate a strong, pro-imperialist governing group, preferably a
  diversity of them, all beholden to the Wall Street imperium. Bush, it should be
  remembered, is a former CIA director. When he went to Poland in July, it is said he
  brought with him $119 million in pledges from the U.S. government to tide the country
  over its most acute period of economic dislocation.</p>

  <p>But that is not all. This former CIA director, now president, has virtually
  unlimited authority to dispense huge funds for covert operations which are not subject
  to oversight by congressional committees. He doesn't have to answer to anybody in the
  U.S. government, except in the case of a mishap or some gross miscalculation. What he
  came with was not just a check from the U.S. government; he came also with graft to be
  passed out to the multitude of Solidarity politicians who will now be in executive and
  legislative positions.</p>

  <p>How naive it is to believe that it is solely ideological affinity that holds
  together this most servile grouping and binds it to the chariot wheel of Wall Street
  finance. The fact that the two bourgeois parties which had been allies of the PUWP
  moved over so swiftly after Bush was there indicates that many palms were greased to
  smooth the ideological changeover. It's an old Yankee custom, learned well on several
  continents.</p>

  <h4>One phase in a long struggle</h4>

  <p>If the economic situation is not resolved, or is resolved by the liquidation of the
  socialist sector of the economy, it will bring on all the chaos of capitalism and impel
  the workers to struggle, not with the Jaruzelski-Solidarity coalition but against it.
  But that remains to be seen. In the meantime it is necessary for the workers and the
  international communist movement to see this as merely one phase in the long protracted
  struggle between capitalism and socialism.</p>

  <p>Imperialism is still riding the wave of an offensive, which began with the
  technological restructuring of the world capitalist economy, starting in the U.S.,
  Japan and West Germany. This revolution in computers, electronics, etc., gave them a
  tremendous advantage and made it possible to extend their sway. At the same time, the
  imperialist bourgeoisie attempted in every way to either isolate the socialist
  countries, or to impose its will through economic and financial devices.</p>

  <p>A worldwide anti-labor, anti-socialist, racist campaign has been underway, extending
  from Smyrna, Tenn., to Howard Beach, N.Y., to Warsaw, Poland to Maputo in Mozambique.
  U.S. imperialism made its greatest inroads in China, but that has been hurled back and
  communists the world over, instead of being indifferent to or attacking China, ought to
  review the lessons involved. It is more germane than any other lesson derived from the
  current international situation.</p>

  <p>This worldwide struggle between capitalism and socialism, between imperialism on the
  one hand and the working class, the oppressed masses and the socialist countries on the
  other, spans an entire historical epoch and encompasses historic victories that have
  changed the face of the world and that capitalism will never dislodge.</p>

  <p>But there are also the inevitable setbacks, of which the Polish situation is a very
  serious one. A momentary stabilization of capitalism on the basis of the
  super-exploitation of the masses, both at home and abroad, has unquestionably added
  momentum to the reactionary worldwide drive. However, the broader tide of history is
  against capitalism. The collapse of capitalism and the victory of the worldwide
  socialist revolution is absolutely inevitable.</p>
