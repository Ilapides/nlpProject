  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Who can fight the drug lords? (Sept. 21,
  1989)</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Who can fight the drug lords?</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Sept. 21, 1989)</h5>It is virtually impossible to fight the drug
  lords without knowing the source of the problem, as well as their allies and partners.
  As we demonstrated in an earlier article (Workers World, <a href="s890907.html">Sept.
  7</a>),1989, the biggest banks are the secret deadly partners of the drug traders and
  criminal drug underworld.

  <h4>Bank Secrecy Act</h4>

  <p>Almost two decades ago the government made an effort to initiate proceedings against
  some of the most powerful banks for money laundering in connection with the drug trade.
  The legislative history of the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 gives overwhelming evidence
  that the legislators were looking at the banks as the source of the drug trade.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the act was to uncover cash transactions between the bankers and the
  drug dealers. As a result of lobbying by the banks, however, the act was watered down
  somewhat and the appearance was given that it was aimed at international banking
  transactions of an illegal character, the kinds of fraudulent practices that are
  commonplace in international finance and don't specifically involve laundering.</p>

  <p>However, the basic aim of the legislation was to deal with the collusion between the
  bankers and the drug dealers. It was supposed to clearly define laundering and prevent
  bankers from engaging in this illicit practice. Even in the weakened version, it
  clearly pointed to the source and the principal culprits: the bankers themselves and
  their accessories in the government.</p>

  <p>This partnership exists on a far wider scale today, as it is impossible for drug
  profits in the billions to be amassed without modern banks where deposits and transfers
  are quickly handled using modern technology and telecommunications.</p>

  <h4>Secret numbered accounts</h4>

  <p>The big banks opposed the Bank Secrecy Act and subsequent legislation. The
  Congressional Quarterly of June 10, 1970, in its section on proceedings of the 91st
  Congress, Second Session, commented: "It is disturbing that some of the largest U.S.
  banks have opposed the legislation, chiefly on grounds that it would impose
  unreasonable record-keeping burdens." Then it quoted Robert M. Morgenthau, former U.S.
  Attorney for the very important Southern District of New York, who said: "The domestic
  banks that have opposed the bill are to a large extent the very same banks that have
  opened foreign branches which provide secret numbered accounts to their customers, who
  in all too many instances are U.S. citizens intent on violating U.S. law."</p>

  <p>The Congressional Quarterly went on: The banks have resisted efforts to get them to
  produce records of their foreign branches on grounds that to do so would make them
  noncompetitive with foreign banks."</p>

  <p>This problem continues to be the subject of new lagislation. The Wall Street Journal
  of Jan. 5, 1989, in an article entitled "Laundering Law Takes Aim Not Just at
  Foreigners" explained that "Tucked away in the massive Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 is a
  provision aimed at shutting down a growth industry: laundering drug money abroad. While
  directed at foreign financial institutions, this provision serves notice on the U.S.
  business community that it must join in the effort to stop money laundering or be
  subject to increasing federal regulation."</p>

  <p>For all the bravado about government toughness, however, the fact is that most of
  this kind of legislation is very weak, of an advisory rather than mandatory
  character.</p>

  <h4>It's money in the bank</h4>

  <p>There have been hundreds of drug busts where cash has been seized. At most these
  amount to several million dollars. But tens of <strong>billions</strong> of dollars
  collected by the drug dealers are in the banks, secure from government raids and
  drawing interest. Cash stashed away in suitcases or safe houses, on the other hand, is
  at great risk and unprofitable.</p>

  <p>The banks themselves urgently need the cash, particularly in moments of crisis, to
  replenish the reserves required by the Federal Reserve Bank.</p>

  <p>It has happened many times that progressive legislation, like the Civil Rights Act
  and others, gets bogged down and then is not enforced because adequate funds for
  prosecution are never made available.</p>

  <p>As can be seen by its title, the 1970 act was directed at secret practices of the
  banks. Did this just mean the secrecy by which banks, while carrying out commercial
  transactions or financial manipulation, can become involved in commonplace fraud and
  deceit? No, because there have been laws on the books dealing with that for a long
  time. The secrecy which had to be uncovered was that between the banks and the criminal
  underworld of drugs.</p>

  <h4>Crime Control Act of 1984</h4>

  <p>More than a decade after passage of the act, little had been done to put the focus
  where it belonged. Many blamed the vagueness of the law. Another piece of legislation
  was passed in 1984 called the Comprehensive Crime Control Act. Its harsh provisions of
  a punitive character against drug dealers got the most publicity. It gave tremendous
  and unprecedented authority to the repressive forces of the U.S. government, allowing
  them to virtually disregard the civil liberties of the people in the alleged hunt for
  drug dealers and their accomplices.</p>

  <p>But this act also contained more stringent provisions making it possible to expose
  the deadly partnership between the banks and the drug dealers. So that a beginning was
  made.</p>

  <p>Finally, using both the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and the Comprehensive Crime Control
  Act of 1984, prosecutions began against some of the biggest banks in the country. But
  these were so low-profile as to go virtually unnoticed. The cut and dried way in which
  they were reported meant that the ordinary reader had no idea of the significance of
  these proceedings.</p>

  <h4>Fines, but no imprisonment</h4>

  <p>However, the importance of the prosecutions can be gauged in other ways. For
  instance, in February 1985, the Bank of Boston was ordered to pay a fine of $500,000
  after pleading guilty to criminal charges that it failed to report $1.2 billion in
  large domestic and international cash transactions. This was a virtual admission of
  money laundering, of cavorting with underground drug crime dealers.</p>

  <p>This was followed in June of the same year by prosecution of four of the biggest
  banks in New York City (and in the world) &mdash; Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers
  Hanover Trust, Chemical Bank and Irving Trust Company. These banks paid civil penalties
  ranging from $210,000 to $360,000 &mdash; which was really like letting them off
  virtually scot-free. No SWAT teams broke into their corporate offices; no bank
  directors were spread-eagled against the wall or thrown to the floor in handcuffs.</p>

  <p>One has to remember that these unreported cash transactions were carried out by
  banks in New York, a huge drug center. The conviction of these banks should have
  attracted a tremendous amount of publicity. The only notice, however, was an article in
  the New York Times of Jan. 22, 1986.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the basic reason for even this meager piece of publicity was that yet
  another financial institution, the Bank of America, was forced to pay a fine of $4.75
  million for failure to report massive cash transactions. The bank's excuse was that its
  personnel were inexperienced, that monitoring and reporting transactions at 1,100
  different branch banks placed too much burden on the bank, and that the law was
  difficult to understand.</p>

  <h4>Government attacks oppressed peoples</h4>

  <p>The Reagan and Bush administrations have since made innumerable pleas for more funds
  for the repressive forces of the U.S. government &mdash; the FBI, CIA and law
  enforcement agencies of all sorts &mdash; but have paid little heed to clearly
  illuminating the partnership between the drug dealers and the bankers.</p>

  <p>As it stands now the attention is drawn away from the basic cause. As always,
  whenever the ruling class is in a crisis, it projects a foreign country as "the enemy."
  The enemy is always somewhere else, never at home. The enemies are the poor peasants in
  the coca fields of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia over whom the Pentagon is planning to
  ride roughshod. Will the government reveal that the real profiteers are right here in
  Wall Street? That could turn into a self-indictment. The Bush administration could find
  itself in the position of the comic strip character Pogo, who said, " We have met the
  enemy, and he is us!"</p>

  <h4>What workers, communities can do</h4>

  <p>The labor movement, the broad civil rights groups and the community organizations of
  all the oppressed now have a very real opening to intervene against the drug lords, if
  they can combine and take advantage of the present situation.</p>

  <p>Consider this: The banks hold the money of tens of millions of depositors. The
  AFL-CIO alone represents a minimum of 20 million workers. Most of them deposit checks
  or money in the banks, as do millions of other workers. There are about another 30
  million depositors in the oppressed communities, making a total of about 50 million
  people who could be represented by a coalition of the trade unions and community and
  civil rights groups.</p>

  <p>Who are these depositors? They are the <strong>creditors</strong> of the banks. Look
  at any annual bank statement and you will see two columns &mdash; assets and
  liabilities. The deposits are listed as <strong>liabilities</strong> of the bank. The
  bank owes that money to its depositors. It is a creditor-debtor relationship in which
  even the smallest depositors, someone with $50 or less, is a creditor and the bank is
  the debtor.</p>

  <h4>Right of creditors to intervene</h4>

  <p>The fact that the depositors are the creditors is an indisputable legal principle
  that has never been contested. Thus millions of depositors acting together could mount
  a considerable effort to participate in the investigation and prosecution of the drug
  lords and the banks.</p>

  <p>Such organizations as the AFL-CIO and the innumerable strong civil rights and
  community organizations have a preponderant and overwhelming interest, both as
  depositors and as workers, to intervene in the phony drug war that the Bush
  administration is conducting and convert it into a real war against the real culprits.
  It is an initiative waiting to happen.</p>

  <p>For decades, the banks have usurped any independent initiative by depositors,
  presuming to represent them. They could do this primarily because no other organization
  has intervened to represent the depositors &mdash; who encompass the mass of the
  working people of this country.</p>

  <p>The Bush and Reagan administrations in their spurious war on drugs have thrown
  billions of dollars into all sorts of government agencies, primarily the most
  repressive ones, contributing nothing but chaos and more crime. Meanwhile, many of
  their own leading people have been involved in the drug trade. (The recent conviction
  of Rep. Pat Swindall (R-Ga.) for accepting $750,000 in what he thought was drug money
  is only the tip of the iceberg.)</p>

  <p>The use of overwhelming force in the oppressed communities is a danger to their very
  existence and proves conclusively that the Bush administration will in no way improve
  the situation. Only an independent, united effort by organizations that are truly
  representative of the broad mass of the people, that is, the workers and people of
  different nationalities, can do it.</p>

  <p>There are innumerable avenues to legally intervene and demand a role in the
  investigative process. The intervention of the labor movement and the broad mass of the
  oppressed communities cannot but change the character of the struggle completely and
  put the government and the bankers on the defensive. It only remains for a willing
  leadership to take the initiative.</p>

  <p>The ultimate result will be to stimulate a spirit of militancy on the part of the
  working class and oppressed people against the Bush administration and the ruling
  class.</p>
