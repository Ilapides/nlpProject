  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Aftermath of the Soviet miner's strike (Aug. 17,
  1989)</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Aftermath of the Soviet miners' strike</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Aug. 17, 1989)</h5>

  <p>The summer of 1989 is likely to go down in Soviet history as the time when the
  Gorbachev administration reached a fork in the road in the development of perestroika
  and in particular in its relations with the broad working class of the USSR.</p>

  <p>The miners' strike has put an altogether new face on all the political and social
  problems. The ferment it has created has stimulated the interest of the whole working
  class. Suffice it to say that barely a few days after the government and the miners
  reached their historic agreement, the railway workers gave notice that they too would
  be on strike unless their demands were met.</p>

  <h4>Strike spread to rail workers</h4>

  <p>Thus, on Aug. 2, the railroad workers went on a brief strike on the Leningrad-Vyborg
  line. While it lasted for only a few hours, it was sufficient to cause Nikolai Konarev,
  the rail minister, to at once enter into negotiations with the workers' representatives
  in Moscow. Their demands, so far as one can learn at this stage, were very similar to
  what the miners were able to obtain (Washington Post, Aug. 4).</p>

  <p>The miners' strike stunned virtually the entire officialdom of the Soviet Union.
  None of them had even hinted that such a development was in the offing. Perhaps the
  best way to understand why the workers suddenly and spontaneously took this massive
  action, on a nationwide scale that included the Donetz Basin, the Kuznetz Basin in
  Western Siberia, the fields in Vorkuta, Rostov and others, is to examine the immediate
  political background.</p>

  <p>In the preceding months &mdash; May, June and July &mdash; glasnost was at its
  height, one might even say at its best. The new parliamentary institutions of the USSR,
  the Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet, were in session. The
  government took every opportunity to spread its perestroika message via the media
  through the length and breadth of the land.</p>

  <p>These meetings were televised in full, so there could be no mistaking that the
  government was making every effort to bring its message to the broadest possible
  audience. It was even reported that production fell markedly during this period, so
  keen was the interest of the people in the deliberations of these bodies. Gorbachev's
  opening speech was heard over and over again. Certainly the masses had every
  opportunity to hear the message of perestroika and the debates surrounding it.</p>

  <p>Why (Gorbachev must ask himself) did the miners then resort to this wholly
  unanticipated action, one he himself compared to an explosion, a virtual Chernobyl? And
  if the coal strike was just an accidental occurrence, why then did the railroad workers
  threaten to carry it even further?</p>

  <h4>Strike a vote of no confidence</h4>

  <p>It would be impossible to argue that the message of perestroika, as interpreted by
  the deputies, officials and Gorbachev himself, had not been heard. Rather, the strike
  was a virtual vote of no confidence in the plans of the government.</p>

  <p>There is a difference between the television reports of the 19th Party Conference
  held last summer and the Congress held at the end of May this year. The 19th Party
  Conference was televised with a view to getting the approval of the world press,
  particularly the world capitalist press. This one, however, was calculated to reach the
  mass of the people at home, and received minimal attention in the capitalist press.</p>

  <p>What, then, went wrong?</p>

  <p>Were Gorbachev to attempt a dispassionate analysis of the basic causes for the
  workers' mass action and the ensuing ferment, he would be wise to go over his own
  speech to the Congress on May 30. He would there discover that he and the mass of the
  workers, in particular the miners, were at cross purposes.</p>

  <h4>Perestroika aggravating economic situation</h4>

  <p>If he were a leader in the Leninist tradition of criticism and self-criticism, he
  would do what Lenin did in the early 1920s when he reviewed the need to abandon War
  Communism and institute a new economic policy. Gorbachev finds himself in the same
  position. His program as elaborated in perestroika is leading to an aggravation of the
  economic situation. It is impelling him in the direction of eroding and nullifying
  socialist ownership of the means of production and plunging into the capitalist
  market.</p>

  <p>Seeing that this is leading to a disastrous situation, Gorbachev should proclaim the
  need for not just a tactical twist and turn here and there but for a strategic retreat,
  an abandonment of the bourgeois character of the reforms and a return to Leninist
  concepts to further socialist construction and advance toward communism. The other way
  leads to the abyss and threatens to put the Soviet economy and those of all the other
  socialist countries at the mercy of the capitalist market and the imperialist
  monopolies.</p>

  <p>The coal mining industry is an example of how perestroika is proceeding. The overall
  aim has always been to achieve an integrated mining industry, fully mechanized and
  automated with the last word in modern technology. This is what one would have expected
  in 1985 when Gorbachev and the other leaders presented their program to a plenary
  session of the Supreme Soviet. Then the masses were led to believe that perestroika
  meant technological restructuring, raising the productivity of labor and developing the
  necessary managerial skills.</p>

  <p>But now the Gorbachev group is pushing instead for a breakup of the mining industry
  into individual enterprises and the dilution of public ownership of one of the basic
  means of production in the hands of the workers' state. He is changing fundamental
  social relations by watering down the public sector while enhancing the private sector
  by various devices. This has led to demoralization of the masses and the corruption of
  those involved.</p>

  <h4>Not what miners wanted to hear</h4>

  <p>During the Congress sessions, the miners, like all the rest of the working class,
  were listening to see what in the speeches of the deputies and in particular of
  Gorbachev himself would speak to their anticipation of increased social benefits and
  relief from the hardships of consumer shortages, lack of adequate housing, unsafe
  working conditions and so on.</p>

  <p>However, Gorbachev's message in particular called for austerity measures of the kind
  constantly being brought up in capitalist countries and which the Soviet press and
  media, especially in earlier days, widely publicized as symptoms of capitalist
  decay.</p>

  <p>"Begin with the fact," he says, "that the state is continuing to live beyond its
  means. Budget expenditures during this five-year plan are growing faster than the
  national economy. Hence the budget deficit is increasing."</p>

  <p>What does that portend for the masses? An increase in social services, or possible
  cuts?</p>

  <p>"A situation is being created," he says, "in which expenditures for wages are
  growing much faster than labor productivity."</p>

  <p>Isn't this what workers in the capitalist countries have had drummed into their ears
  day in and day out? All of which Soviet workers have heard about. Again, what does this
  portend for Soviet workers now?</p>

  <p>"An analysis of the causes of the current situation would be incomplete if we did
  not point out that the losses from mismanagement and low labor discipline continue to
  be great." It is small comfort to the workers that the managerial elite are being
  castigated along with "low labor discipline." The former are not likely to suffer at
  the hands of the Gorbachev administration, which has become enamored with the idea of
  giving the managers greater and greater freedom and independence. The complaint about
  low labor discipline, however, carries the threat of displacement.</p>

  <h4>More managers per worker</h4>

  <p>In connection with this, the workers have seen what happens with managerial
  independence and autonomy. Gorbachev admits that "the granting of economic independence
  is being accompanied by growth in the number of personnel. For every six workers, there
  is a manager or a specialist. Hence, someone is benefiting from this." This is no
  revelation to the workers, for whom it means speedup and an intensification of the
  labor process.</p>

  <p>How can any worker become enthusiastic about that? But that is not all. Gorbachev
  has also come back to one of the frequent refrains that used to be heard over and over
  in the old days, and which has taken on an especially offensive character in the more
  recent period.</p>

  <p>"In solving problems of the country's social and economic development, we must
  proceed from the consistent implementation of the principle of social justice. It is
  not enough to proclaim it: It is also necessary to put into action social and economic
  mechanisms that will make it possible to eliminate the main hindrance to our
  development &mdash; leveling and the deeply rooted psychology of dependence."</p>

  <p>Who are the levelers? Are they the top leaders in the governmental apparatus? Are
  they the scientific and literary intelligentsia? Are they the managers? Isn't it true
  that this is aimed solely and exclusively at the workers, who are not trying to level
  the higher-paid workers down to the lower level but are attempting to raise themselves
  to a higher standard of living?</p>

  <p>Isn't leveling an outcry against social and economic privilege?</p>

  <p>Do Gorbachev and his supporters really expect the workers to become enthused with
  perestroika in the face of all this?</p>

  <p>It is hard to see how workers can draw inspiration from this rather than from the
  example set by the miners. The concessions the miners won in terms of immediate demands
  are substantial (they include extra pay for night and evening shifts, Sundays off,
  portal-to-portal pay, improved pensions and sick leave benefits) and it is impossible
  to avoid the conclusion that workers in other industries will be influenced by what has
  been achieved. It is a momentous beginning to a resurgence of the working class.</p>

  <p>But the immediate economic gains won by the miners were sandwiched together with a
  broader economic program which is part of the perestroika restructuring plans.</p>

  <h4>Broader economic content of agreement</h4>

  <p>The contract with the coal miners can be divided into two parts: those clauses which
  pertain to immediate economic demands and those which are of a broader economic
  character, namely, the economic independence of the enterprises, a method of
  profit-sharing, and the right of individual enterprises to dispose of excess coal
  production through sale at home and abroad.</p>

  <p>The basic thrust of the economic independence clause amounts to this: that whatever
  profit can be obtained by selling coal left over after government quotas have been
  fulfilled will redound to the benefit of the coal mining enterprise. As the text of the
  agreement says, "industrial enterprises are to be granted the right, as of 1 August
  1989, to sell above-contract output at contract prices within the country and to other
  countries" (Sovetskaya Rossiya, July 22).</p>

  <p>This may appear attractive. However, as Gorbachev himself explained in his May 30
  speech to the Congress, one of the basic reasons for the crisis in the Soviet economy
  is "the extensive losses linked to the drop in world prices for fuel and raw
  materials." Coal is one of those fuels. The Soviet Union is a significant exporter of
  gas, oil and coal.</p>

  <h4>Individual mines to compete on market</h4>

  <p>Thus, the very idea of linking the wages and benefits of the workers in a coal
  mining enterprise to the capitalist world market, which at the present time is glutted,
  portends not higher benefits but lower ones.</p>

  <p>Moreover, competition among the various coal mining enterprises can result in
  overproduction, if the product is destined for the world capitalist market. It has been
  difficult enough for Soviet coal to compete on the world market as an integrated
  industry, but then at least the Soviet government could offer one uniform price.
  However, if each mining district is to offer its own price, they are in effect bidding
  against each other in the capitalist market.</p>

  <p>What good can possibly be derived from competition in the domestic market if in the
  world market competition forces them to accept lower prices?</p>

  <p>With the coal destined for socialist countries, if competition is to be the driving
  force, then it pits the Soviet miners against the miners of Poland or Yugoslavia. What
  then does socialist solidarity or COMECON planning mean?</p>

  <h4>Cost accounting and self-financing</h4>

  <p>It's difficult to know in the final analysis what is meant by cost accounting and
  self-financing, two of the cardinal features of perestroika. Self-financing widens the
  latitude of each enterprise's managerial group in the use of its financial resources,
  but at the same time limits the enterprise drawing on the resources of the central
  government.</p>

  <p>By breaking up an integrated industry like coal into various independent
  enterprises, it is assumed that the savings of the enterprise would result in social
  benefits for the workers in it. Instead, however, as we already quoted from Gorbachev,
  "the granting of economic independence is being accompanied by the growth in the number
  of personnel. For every six workers, there is a manager or a specialist." Doesn't such
  an enormous development nullify the whole scheme for managerial independence?</p>

  <p>Nothing could be more damning than such an admission. The whole program is promoted
  as one where the heavy weight of bureaucracy is to be reduced. But it turns out that,
  at least on a managerial scale, it has vastly increased.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the savings from operating as an independent unit were supposed to then be
  available to be spent on social services or wage increases. Instead, however, large
  sums are accumulating in the treasuries of these enterprises. Since the managers are
  free to use them more or less as they see fit, they are being invested in areas which
  produce a quick profit but do not necessarily have any value for the socialist economy
  or the workers.</p>

  <p>Indeed, such independence in the financial field is the cause of overblown personal
  gain and even a vast increase in corruption on a managerial level.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev told the Congress: "In connection with the radical economic reform,
  financial and material resources are being accumulated at enterprises and in local
  administrative agencies. It seems to me that labor collectives could pool their efforts
  to expand the base of medical service for the population."</p>

  <p>First, he wants to break up an integrated industry for the purposes of distribution
  and sale, and then he brings in through the back door a form of collectivism, the
  pooling of efforts, which is the very opposite of what he is trying to stimulate. It's
  no wonder, then, that improved health care is one of the pressing demands of workers in
  all communities, as reflected in the Soviet press.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev on `flexible relations'</h4>

  <p>Gorbachev has again restated his reforms, this time as "a radical updating of
  relations of socialist ownership and the development and combination of its various
  forms. We favor the creation of flexible and effective relations with respect to the
  use of public property so that every form of ownership demonstrates its vitality and
  right to exist in lively and fair competition."</p>

  <p>These are disguised efforts to undermine socialist ownership in favor of some form
  of private ownership. After four years of perestroika, of private cooperatives, of
  leasing the land, of legislation favoring individual entrepreneurs, he now wants to
  embark on a program of further destabilizing elements of public ownership.</p>

  <p>There are public ownership and private ownership. Creating some mythical hybrid form
  is mere deception. Socialist ownership has proven itself superior to capitalism. How
  else could the Soviet Union have become second in the so-called superpower race?</p>

  <p>What does this "fair competition" among forms of ownership signify to the miners,
  for instance? The mines are public property owned by the state in accordance with the
  constitution of the USSR. Does he now want to release them to private ownership under
  the guise of some form of cooperative enterprise?</p>

  <p>Calling it a flexible and effective use of public property is a coverup. It is plain
  that the Gorbachev reforms are heading away from socialization, away from advancing
  toward communism, and back toward the older forms of bourgeois and petit bourgeois
  private ownership. This is particularly devastating for the coal industry when it must
  compete on the world market. The capitalist markets of France, Britain and West Germany
  are integrated industries that have been rationalized and modernized at the expense of
  brutal onslaughts against the working class, particularly in Britain, so that they have
  been able to reduce the price of coal.</p>

  <p>What the Gorbachev administration wants to do is avoid taking the blame for the
  losses sustained in competition with the capitalist countries. Instead of letting the
  all-union socialist government foot the bill, if that becomes necessary, he'd rather
  make it appear that the losses are incurred as a result of poor management of the
  individual enterprises.</p>

  <h4>Capitalist industry integrated and rationalized</h4>

  <p>All this might make some sense if the capitalist coal industry were broken up into
  small units, but this is not likely because the mines in the capitalist countries are
  if anything more integrated and rationalized and are managed by a combination of the
  bankers and industrialists. It's not at all a case of the old free market as it
  presumably existed in the 19th century. It's finance capital, where competition is not
  only of a predatory character but is more destructive in relation to any rivals,
  especially those from a socialist country.</p>

  <p>It is no wonder, then, that Valentine Medvedev, secretary of the Central Committee
  of the Coal Miners' Union, said recently, "Many problems have been aggravated since the
  introduction of cost accounting and self-financing on January 1 of this year."</p>

  <p>Gorbachev told the Congress that considerable resources can be freed up by "sharply
  reducing the volume of capital investments in the construction of production
  facilities." Capital investment means the construction of plants and equipment &mdash;
  in Marxist terminology, the means of production.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev regime is headed in the other direction at a time when the imperialist
  bourgeoisie is speeding up capital investment, enlisting the support of the entire
  capitalist establishment. In the U.S. the government wants to support capital
  investment by exorbitant tax credits. For instance, the New York Times of Aug. 7 stated
  editorially that the most effective way to get corporations to invest more is to
  reimburse them for a part of the cost of investment. The only point of contention in
  the bourgeoisie is how to apply the tax credits. Some say they should be advanced only
  to those who are introducing more modern equipment. It indicates how deeply concerned
  both segments of the capitalist establishment, liberals and conservatives, are about
  uniting to spur capitalist investment in order to compete on the world arena.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev says he wants the USSR to become integrated into the world capitalist
  market. Regardless of the merit of this scheme, how can that be done when his aim is to
  cut down on capital investment? It is of course possible that in the USSR some
  industrial and technological facilities have not proven economical, or have become
  so-called white elephants. But that only means that the planning has to be perfected,
  not abandoned.</p>

  <p>That this should have to be discussed in the year 1989, after so many decades of
  rich experience in the Soviet Union, speaks ill of the Gorbachev administration.</p>

  <p>There has to be a balance, of course, between planning for consumption and
  production. During the war years and especially the difficult years of the cold war,
  when the Soviet Union was virtually blockaded economically as well as politically, the
  rate of building consumer industries declined, both absolutely and in relative numbers.
  In order to catch up, it was necessary to pay the greatest attention to them.</p>

  <h4>Perestroika now aimed at changing relations of production</h4>

  <p>However, instead of proceeding with a more comprehensive plan to develop consumer
  industries, Gorbachev has now embarked on a plan to change the relations of production,
  to reduce socialist planning, to bring about capitalist competition, and in general to
  create disorder and chaos in the economy. That is what perestroika has amounted to.</p>

  <p>Any way one views it, the time has come for even the staunchest supporters of
  perestroika to admit that they have to review their strategic conception. The strikes
  of coal miners and other workers make it very clear that the issue now is whether to
  serve the interests of the working class or to dissipate and erode the achievements of
  the socialist revolution in the interests of petit bourgeois schemes, of changing
  property relations in the Soviet Union, which could only provoke civil conflict and
  ultimately a struggle of the working class against the government as such.</p>

  <p>It holds a great danger for the Soviet Union. As the miners' strike shows, the
  outright bourgeois elements in the Soviet Union, who have now officially organized
  themselves as a grouping in the Congress, are able and willing to exploit the
  grievances of the workers and try and turn them in an anti-socialist direction. All the
  newspapers in the Soviet Union carried news of how a great number of agitators
  descended upon the coal miners with advice on building independent unions. Independent
  of whom? Not of the bourgeoisie, not of the imperialists, not of the capitalist
  market.</p>

  <p>Already the workers are endangered ideologically when they see the Gorbachev
  administration sanctifying the coalition in Poland between the imperialist-supported,
  CIA-constructed Solidarity leadership and the Polish United Workers Party based on a
  program which can only antagonize the majority of the workers. What are the Soviet
  workers to think when they see what is happening in Poland?</p>
