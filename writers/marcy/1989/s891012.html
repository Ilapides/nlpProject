  <h1>The anti-strike legislation of the Gorbachev regime and the resurgence of the
  working class</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Oct. 12, 1989)</h5>

  <p>In the spirit of a classical bourgeois parliament, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on
  Oct. 3 passed its first significant piece of anti-working class legislation.</p>

  <p>This came in the form of a proposal by General Secretary of the Communist Party and
  President of the Supreme Soviet Mikhail Gorbachev for a 15-month ban on strikes and
  other, more serious emergency powers. These powers, he explained, are meant to "defend
  democracy against anarchy and complete economic mismanagement" (UPI, Oct. 2).</p>

  <p>Gorbachev's original proposals were somewhat softened and restricted after hours of
  deliberations and negotiations between government officials and the Soviet
  parliamentarians.</p>

  <p>The legislation was passed with virtually unanimous agreement among the various
  political groupings, who congratulated themselves on the accomplishment. Each had been
  given the opportunity to demagogue throughout the two-day session of the Supreme
  Soviet.</p>

  <p>It should be taken note of that all of a sudden, the recent talk of a coup, military
  or political, has been suspended. It is being replaced by a barrage of panic stories
  regarding the total collapse of the economy.</p>

  <h4>Deputies afraid of the workers</h4>

  <p>Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov led the parade. "This country cannot stand another
  strike like the miners." Others called up the specter of immediate economic
  disaster.</p>

  <p>They all seemed to chime in simultaneously. All but the workers. All but the
  proletarian masses who have built the mines, mills and factories. All but those whose
  sweat and blood have made the Soviet Union the second greatest industrial and
  technological fortress.</p>

  <p>Where were they in all this legislative charade? Oh sure, there were parliamentary
  representatives of certain districts where workers live or work. But are they really
  workers, or are they lawyers, trained careerists in the Party apparatus, in the higher
  institutions of learning, or from the managerial elite?</p>

  <p>Was any group of organized workers represented at the parliamentary hearings? Was
  even the All-Union Trade Union Council, the so-called official trade union, called in
  to testify? Were the leaders of the miners or the other unions that have been on strike
  throughout the country consulted? That's a question to ask the bourgeois
  parliamentarians.</p>

  <p>Certainly there is a critical economic situation in the country. We have written
  about it in these pages for a considerable period of time. But these latest scare
  stories of the imminent collapse of the Soviet economy, are they true? It is necessary
  to separate fact from fiction.</p>

  <h4>A change of tune</h4>

  <p>Up until the miners' strike, the Gorbachev administration was trying to assure the
  country and the world that the crisis was exaggerated, that it was all manageable, and
  that improvement was gradually on the way.</p>

  <p>But the miners, and for that matter the whole working class, had never been
  consulted on any of the plans of the Gorbachev administration. On the in were only this
  motley crew of technocrats, bourgeois economists and party careerists who have learned
  to hop from one ministry to another. And most of all, there is an utterly new layer in
  the upper crust of Soviet society: lawyers. Long looked upon derisively as
  practitioners of a petty bourgeois profession, they have slowly and gradually, since
  the end of the Leninist era, climbed to the top.</p>

  <p>The labyrinthine structure of the bureaucracy and its artificially complex character
  has made lawyers the key profession in governmental affairs. Law is not just the art of
  jurisprudence, it is something akin to bourgeois politics, where the lawyers know the
  ins and outs of the bureaucratic and managerial apparatus.</p>

  <p>Like in the U.S., it is not the able and talented students of the law who become
  most prominent, but those who know the ins and outs of capitalist politics and can
  attach themselves to or get bribed into the big corporate law firms. The real scholars
  write the briefs and get paid relatively low wages, whereas the others are just another
  form of capitalist exploiters.</p>

  <p>Now we have a variety of this species in the Soviet Union, and they are at the top
  of the heap. Gorbachev symbolizes their ascendancy.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Soviet economy is in great danger, but the hyperbole used by Ryzhkov
  is a fraud. "The country couldn't stand another strike." The country survived hundreds
  and thousands of military strikes by the Nazis that leveled the cities. Now this
  bureaucrat tells us to watch out for the great danger! There are strikes; the workers
  are on the march.</p>

  <h4>Why Yeltsin and Aganbegyan came to U.S.</h4>

  <p>What was the real mission when Boris Yeltsin and Gorbachev's close associate A.
  Aganbegyan came to the U.S. last month hat in hand? To warn the imperialists of the
  coming economic disaster and get their help? But what concretely did they mean?</p>

  <p>That they fear a tumultuous, nationwide working class upsurge that would endanger
  the bourgeois reforms, which the imperialists all over the world have been praising to
  the skies.</p>

  <p>Aganbegyan let the cat out of the bag when he unburdened himself to none other than
  that stalwart pillar of big business and high finance, the Wall Street Journal in an
  interview with George Melloan (Sept. 12).</p>

  <p>"We are in deep crisis," said Aganbegyan, "especially a financial crisis and a
  crisis of the consumer goods market." That much he has said over and over again in the
  Soviet press. But here he added something else. The crisis "provokes social unrest. The
  strikes of miners were the clang of the first bell. They were the first sign that we
  are moving toward economic disaster." How incredible! How utterly shameless!</p>

  <p>He sounds more like a stool pigeon informing against the workers than a proletarian
  statesman meeting an imperialist interviewer.</p>

  <p>Such is the real state of affairs. He not only came hat in hand on behalf of the
  Gorbachev administration to the imperialist colossus; he then tried to frighten them
  with the specter of a full-scale intervention of the working class, which could topple
  the whole ramshackle fantasy of market socialism, the precursor for the restoration of
  capitalism.</p>

  <h4>Strikes show workers are divorced from apparatus</h4>

  <p>What about the workers themselves? The upsurge of the miners did in fact set off a
  wave of strikes. And it has all been done by rank and file workers and lower union,
  party and labor collective officials.</p>

  <p>The specific characteristic of them all is their complete divorce from the
  governmental apparatus, and their defiance of it. This is the working class unshackled.
  They have rebuffed the maneuvers of the bourgeois opposition and made clear they want
  no truck with the likes of a Polish Solidarity-led union.</p>

  <p>They also rebuffed Gorbachev himself when they called for the shutdown of the
  private cooperatives, which Gorbachev himself admits have become a scandalous form for
  raising prices and spending money not on productive work but on personal
  aggrandizement.</p>

  <p>Just a few weeks ago Gorbachev was attempting a highly publicized and carefully
  crafted maneuver to coopt the miners and all the workers into his fold. Now, he has
  begun to denounce them for their "ultimatistic" demands. This reached a crescendo with
  his vicious characterization of the strikers in his address to the Supreme Soviet on
  Oct. 2.</p>

  <p>"These measures are meant to defend democracy against anarchy and complete economic
  mismanagement." Defend democracy? This is a euphemism for defense of the bourgeoisie.
  Against anarchy? That's the working class. Complete economic mismanagement? That one's
  right on the mark. But it's the Gorbachev administration that is mismanaging and
  leading the country into an economic impasse from which it cannot disentangle itself
  without either falling into the arms of bourgeois restoration or facing the specter of
  an independent, truly revolutionary working class resurgence.</p>

  <h4>Struggle between two class poles</h4>

  <p>Let the world not be deceived by the fact that the working class resurgence has only
  reached the level of economism, that is, it is confined thus far to the bread and
  butter issues. The contemporary historical context is a struggle for power of only two
  significant forces. The new bourgeois elements have been slowly germinating over
  decades and are now coming into full bloom. The really new phenomenon is the resurgence
  of the working class.</p>

  <p>The bureaucracy is in the middle. Gorbachev has correctly been called a centrist. He
  wavers between the two poles, but consistently gives ground to, continually appeases
  and feeds the bourgeois elements. He calls for the restoration of some collective and
  state farms into private hands and for wholesale decollectivization. He calls for
  decentralization, for economic independence on a small-scale basis.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie demands decentralization of all industry and free rein for the
  capitalist market.</p>

  <p>Once again, history is showing that there are only two world class social forces on
  the contemporary arena: the world bourgeoisie and the world proletariat, whose natural
  allies are all the oppressed peoples.</p>

  <h4>Use of military force in ethnic dispute</h4>

  <p>The most disappointing and indeed humiliating aspect of the proposal by Gorbachev is
  to use the military to move the railroads. This of course refers to the bitter strife
  between Azerbaijan and Armenia, where freight and passenger traffic have been stalled
  arising out of their dispute over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

  <p>Using the military to settle an inter-ethnic dispute is an utterly incredible
  development in light of the history of the USSR. Proletarian internationalism and
  socialist solidarity among the workers was one of the prerequisites for the great
  success of the October Revolution.</p>

  <p>That the threat to use military force to solve the national problem should be
  brought up before the whole world shows to what depths the current leaders of the
  Soviet Union have sunk.</p>

  <p>Gone and altogether forgotten, as though they never existed, are the days when
  Bolshevik agitators and propagandists were the shock brigades of the revolutionary
  Marxist and Leninist party. They went everywhere and anywhere there were inter-ethnic
  disputes. On the basis of their own bitter experience resulting from czarist
  oppression, they were able to exchange experiences, draw lessons from the past, and
  apply revolutionary internationalist tactics to win the masses toward socialist
  solidarity and away from national animosities.</p>

  <p>This is how the dozens of nationalities in the Soviet Union were welded together in
  a firm alliance, one great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It was the force of
  common experience, ideas and ideals which enabled Bolshevik agitators and propagandists
  to communicate and conduct dialogues with the people &mdash; not the monologues of the
  bureaucracy to the nationalities.</p>

  <p>The use of military force to solve the national problem is a sign of the bankruptcy
  of the politics of the Gorbachev regime. They stimulated and brought to the fore
  ancient antagonisms which had been buried; they reignited them with the introduction of
  bourgeois reforms, which invigorated national egoism and hence national
  antagonisms.</p>

  <h4>Need for an internationalist approach</h4>

  <p>Once the Azerbaijan-Armenia dispute was underway, it was late in the day to attempt
  to settle it simply on the basis of constitutional provisions. This was inadequate,
  especially since the bourgeois reforms, instead of being abandoned, were in effect
  strengthened. In effect the whole strategy of the Gorbachev regime was to bribe each of
  the administrations in the republics, rather than to find a truly internationalist and
  proletarian approach.</p>

  <p>But how could they when they themselves have abandoned the proletarian
  internationalist approach?</p>

  <p>How could they when they have regularly and arbitrarily ousted one leadership after
  another in the republics?</p>

  <p>Now, after all of this, they are still scrounging around for leaders who have mass
  influence, after the masses themselves have become infected with the virus of
  nationalism.</p>

  <p>It is not hard to find the reason for it. The first Kazakhstan rebellion, which the
  Gorbachev administration provoked by ousting the leader of the Kazakh Party and
  replacing him with an ethnic Russian, should have been a signal to them to earnestly
  search for an internationalist solution to the problem on the basis of whatever
  prestige or moral authority the Party itself had.</p>

  <p>But instead of that, they dilly-dallied, called one small meeting after another
  without making a decision. They lectured the Azerbaijanis and the Armenians but never
  called into session the one authoritative body of the government which might have
  solved the problem, the Soviet of Nationalities.</p>

  <p>Instead, they continually held up the prospect that solutions would be forthcoming
  at the 19th Party Conference. Which meant the nationalities waited and waited, while
  the antagonisms and animosities sharpened.</p>

  <p>So what happened to the Azerbaijan-Armenia issue? Both delegations eagerly awaited
  the presentation of their cases and a decision. Now, more than a full year later, one
  can see that the 19th Party Conference was staged for the purpose of influencing the
  imperialist bourgeoisie with the reforms, of winning their confidence. It gave short
  shrift to the national question as a whole.</p>

  <p>Mostly sound and fury came out of the 19th Party Conference. They sang paeans of
  praise to the economic reforms and denounced the past, indulging in orgies of bourgeois
  anti-Stalinism. The Party leadership, having lost its moral authority, sought refuge in
  makeshift concessions, a form of bribery to the upper crust of the nationalist elements
  in both republics. These have only aggravated the situation.</p>

  <p>Those who squander the Leninist legacy of revolutionary internationalism ultimately
  resort to naked force. That is precisely the meaning of Gorbachev's emergency
  legislation empowering use of the military.</p>

  <p>Only a classwide resurgence of the working class, which is at last making itself
  felt, offers hope for the future.</p>
