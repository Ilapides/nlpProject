  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Bush's China junket (Dec. 21, 1989)</title>

  <h1>Bush's China junket</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Dec. 21, 1989)</h5>

  <p>If the Bush administration hoped that, by sending a high-level delegation to
  Beijing, it could recapture a good part of the relationship it had with China in
  earlier years, the trip proved to be a howling blunder from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>The deliberate attempts to keep it secret, when there was no reason to do so,
  boomeranged, especially when the White House made the announcement at 2 a.m. on the
  morning of Dec. 9 to a press corps which was awaiting some spectacular China
  development. As it turned out, the mission of national security adviser Brent Scowcroft
  and Deputy Secretary of State Laurence Eagleburger produced nothing of real value to
  U.S. finance capital.</p>

  <p>The Bush administration should have known that what Kissinger himself could not do
  with his earlier mission to China, his subordinates from the same fraternity, the
  Rockefeller-controlled Council on Foreign Relations, could not possibly do. Especially
  since Nixon himself had already tried, with perhaps even greater effort.</p>

  <h4>Cocky after Malta</h4>

  <p>What caused them to suddenly believe they could really restore the old relationship,
  which so heavily favored imperialist penetration and slow and gradual political
  counterrevolution in China? Obviously, some in the White House were so enthralled with
  their apparent diplomatic gains at the Bush-Gorbachev Malta conference that they
  thought China might be ripe for the "new thinking" so well advertised by the Gorbachev
  administration.</p>

  <p>Forgotten in all this was that the People's Republic of China has made a fundamental
  reorientation, not only of its political course at home, but even more significantly of
  the direction of its economic system &mdash; a virtual revolution in itself.</p>

  <p>It would seem as though all this was forgotten in Washington in the euphoria over
  their gains at the Malta conference. But, as the New York Times ruefully admitted in
  its editorial of Dec. 12, every day brings new evidence that China is continuing to
  deepen its socialist course. No diplomatic ploy on the part of the U.S. can change
  that.</p>

  <p>After having fomented and promoted economic and financial penetration of China, and
  finally the emergence of a violent counterrevolution, Washington now sends a delegation
  with a straight face asking to resume the old friendly relationship! That's adding
  insult to injury.</p>

  <p>The polite and diplomatic manner in which the Chinese leadership greeted the U.S.
  delegation does not in any way diminish what is said above. China needs and has always
  wanted to increase its trade and commercial ties, not only with U.S. imperialism, but
  with the other capitalist countries and the world at large in order to accelerate the
  development of its vast resources and population. This should be taken as the normal
  course of business, which for more than 30 years the U.S. boycotted, attempting to
  isolate China in order to support the defeated and discredited remnants of the Chiang
  Kai-shek regime in Taiwan. The U.S. still clings to the Chinese province of Taiwan as
  its military outpost, continuing to arm it, feed it economically and prop it up
  politically.</p>

  <h4>No more `strategic alliance'</h4>

  <p>The explanation that the Scowcroft-Eagleburger mission was going to China to brief
  them on the substance of Bush's discussions with Gorbachev, on the assumption that
  China is a strategic ally of the U.S., was simply too ridiculous. "Why call us a
  strategic ally if you have now consummated a strategic alliance with our supposed
  adversary?" the Chinese leaders might well have asked. Obviously, the
  Scowcroft-Eagleburger missionaries thought that by rekindling some of the old fires of
  earlier Sino-Soviet struggles, they would regain some of the old leverage. It didn't
  work.</p>

  <p>The term strategic was barely referred to during the meeting by either delegation.
  It was all friendly and even cordial, and all the diplomatic niceties were carried out,
  but so far as any restoration of the old relationship, it was a complete flop.</p>

  <h4>Anger in Congress</h4>

  <p>That's why the anger in Congress at the mission. Of course, their public posture was
  that they were outraged because the administration was dealing with China and had
  forgotten its so-called human rights mission. This was in line with the Times
  editorial, which referred to the Chinese leadership as "the butchers of Beijing."</p>

  <p>All this anger in the halls of Congress, especially from the Democratic side, and
  from the capitalist press, however, comes more because of disappointment at their
  inability to regain some of the old foothold. All those who are weeping over the lives
  lost in Tiananmen Square have not been so conspicuous in demonstrating their concern
  over the spilling of blood in El Salvador, in the Philippines, in South Africa, and in
  the phony drug war which imperialist high finance is conducting at home.</p>

  <h4>A lost opportunity</h4>

  <p>Even though the Gorbachev administration had taken steps earlier to normalize
  relations with China following bitter years of conflict, the Soviet side lost the
  opportunity to send a high-level delegation to Beijing before the Malta conference and
  brief a fraternal socialist ally on the agenda at the meeting.</p>

  <p>That would have been an act of solidarity, of socialist fraternity, and would have
  reversed the course set in motion by Khrushchev when he first embarked upon personal
  summitry during the Eisenhower administration and disregarded what then was a solid
  socialist alliance, codified in the Sino-Soviet treaty of 1950. That treaty meant a lot
  in terms of socialist internationalism.</p>

  <p>Following the victory of the Chinese Revolution, the People's Republic of China
  demanded that it occupy the seat held by Chiang Kai-shek in the Security Council and
  that the Chiang mercenaries be ousted from the UN. When U.S. opposition prevented the
  recognition of the PRC, the Soviet Union went to the extent of boycotting the UN
  altogether for a period of time.</p>

  <p>One would hope that, notwithstanding the reaction that has enveloped the USSR and
  Eastern Europe, fraternal socialist solidarity will be renewed and reinforced between
  these two great socialist states that represent a tremendous portion of the world's
  people.</p>
