  <h1>Political significance of the market collapse</h1>

  <h2>The myth of the free market</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Oct. 26, 1989)</h5>

  <p>Since the establishment of the U.S. government, manufacturers, bankers, landlords
  and slaveowners have all been unanimous in crying, "No government intervention in the
  affairs of the free market!"</p>

  <p>So pervasive has this cry been through the centuries of the rule of big business
  that nothing seems to shake it. In foul and fair weather, the cry is raised again and
  again: "The free market will regulate itself. It needs no outside interference. It
  needs no bureaucrats. The market knows best."</p>

  <p>Thus it would seem, from a superficial reading of U.S. history, that every move by
  the government which in any way would seek to regulate, help or restrain the banking,
  commercial and manufacturing interests is met with the same old refrain: "No government
  intervention!"</p>

  <p>Even some of the most liberal-minded politicians invoke the old Jeffersonian maxim
  that government is best which governs least.</p>

  <p>The people will always be duped and hopelessly deceived if they accept these
  pronouncements of the ruling class as genuine articles of faith representing their real
  views.</p>

  <p>But Marxism teaches the masses, on the basis of the materialist conception of
  history, that in order to understand the real motivation of social classes and
  political groupings, it is necessary to go beyond the hundreds of ingratiating and
  appealing slogans and examine the question from the point of view of their class needs
  and interests. The question is always what motivation, what social, economic and
  political interest lies behind this or that slogan. In no other way can we even
  approach the real truth.</p>

  <h4>Attitude toward a central bank</h4>

  <p>Beginning with the year 1791, when the first attempt was made to establish a U.S.
  central bank, the financial and commercial groupings as well as the planters didn't
  regard it from the point of view of any "revealed truth" in the slogans of the
  politicians of the time, but wanted to know what specific interest it would serve.</p>

  <p>The slogans about being for the good of the country, for progress, never made any
  impact on the vested interests of the classes that ruled the U.S. They were strictly
  concerned with their financial and economic interests.</p>

  <p>When the First Bank of the U.S. went under in 1811, no one seemed too concerned with
  its demise. It was more than 100 years before the Federal Reserve was established in
  1913, and the historical record shows that the largest bankers and manufacturers were
  opposed to it. The slogan of the bourgeoisie at the time was of course the same old one
  &mdash; no interference by the government in the free market. They didn't need any
  bureaucrats to run the banking system.</p>

  <p>Woodrow Wilson promoted the idea of the Federal Reserve Bank. It was one of his most
  demagogic promises as a presidential candidate that he would rein in the banks, put an
  end to "funny money," and see to it that the banks were controlled by the people.
  Wilson's strategy was to undercut the remains of the Populist movement of the time and
  coopt a resurgent working class, the most advanced sections of which were veering in
  the direction of the Socialist Party headed by Eugene V. Debs.</p>

  <p>Debs nevertheless amassed a record vote of over one million at a time when both
  women and Black people were disenfranchised.</p>

  <p>But when all is said and done, Wilson's Federal Reserve and its various regional
  banks ended up as a bankers' institution more than any other institution since. It is
  not at all accidental that none of the Federal Reserve officers are elected. They are
  all appointed. Today it is composed entirely of bankers and, moreover, of right-wing
  Republicans.</p>

  <h4>When they invoke the free market</h4>

  <p>The ruling class becomes extremely vocal with its free market sloganeering when the
  U.S. government is under extreme pressure from economic crisis and the anger of
  millions of workers, as evidenced in the 1930s with the historic upsurge of the working
  class.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a time when no government in Europe or America, conservative or
  liberal, could withstand the pressure without embarking on major social programs such
  as unemployment insurance and social security. The bourgeoisie, almost unanimously,
  denounced it all as pump-priming, which would ruin the country if not all Western
  civilization!</p>

  <p>In one form or another, the self-serving slogans about the free market and
  nonintervention prevail to this day. Now and then they are muted, but then they loudly
  reappear.</p>

  <p>This went on until the early hours of Saturday morning, Oct. 14. The last echo came
  from Jay Golden, a young stock market prophet of the firm of Jefferis &amp; Co., a
  large West Coast brokerage firm. He was asked on Cable News what the government should
  do to help in light of the stock market collapse. "The government should not
  interfere," he said. "You cannot legislate the market. The market should be left
  alone."</p>

  <h4>Suddenly, cheers for the Fed</h4>

  <p>The next 24 hours heard a deafening silence on this issue. No more talk of
  nonintervention. The silence prevailed for a full day. Then came an outburst of cheers
  that reverberated from Wall Street in the East to San Francisco in the West. The
  Federal Reserve Bank, the financial arm of the U.S. government, would unload billions
  to prop up the market! The mood quickly changed from gloom to euphoria.</p>

  <p>Alan Greenspan and his colleagues in the Federal Reserve, together with the
  Treasury, had opened the spigot. Cash was flowing like water into the coffers of the
  big institutions. The money managers of the big funds, the banks and insurance
  companies were to share in it, lifting themselves out of a morass of hundreds of
  billions in losses.</p>

  <p>Who got in on this monstrous giveaway? It's not yet known, but it certainly went to
  the selected elite groupings of the Wall Street mob. The little investors, about whom
  they and the capitalist press are always so solicitous, were wiped out.</p>

  <p>"As trading opened yesterday morning on the big board, stocks of many of the
  nation's biggest companies couldn't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was
  overwhelming buyers. By 10:10, the Dow Industrials were off 63.52 points ... . But
  then, as quickly as the Dow had fallen, it began to turn around, and ended with a gain
  of 82.12 points." (Wall Street Journal, Oct. 17.)</p>

  <p>What did it? A magic wand? No, not a wand but a flood of government funds. Early
  estimates were $2 billion, but it is sure to turn out to be much more.</p>

  <h4>No legal basis for it</h4>

  <p>The most important questions that leaders of the working class, progressive and
  civil rights movements must address themselves to is, Where did this money come from?
  Did this small group of Federal Reserve officers have the legal and constitutional
  authority to transfer this huge sum of money from the Treasury in order to save the
  hides of a handful of big financial and industrial magnates?</p>

  <p>Article 1, Section 9, Subsection 7 of the U.S. Constitution specifically and
  categorically makes clear that "No money shall be withdrawn from the Treasury but in
  consequence of appropriations made by law." Article 1, Section 8 states that only
  Congress "shall have power to lay and collect taxes" and to "coin money [and] regulate
  the value thereof."</p>

  <p>Just suppose that a left-wing or progressive government had been elected. Then
  suppose it siphoned off, in an illegal transfer of funds such as has just taken place,
  billions of dollars and pumped it into housing for the homeless, childcare, medical
  care, education and so on. The capitalist media and press would be saturated with
  violent attacks on the government.</p>

  <p>There is no legal authority for what the Federal Reserve has just done. Bourgeois
  economists will try to explain this huge swindle on the basis of the discredited
  trickle-down theory &mdash; that if you give a billion dollars to a giant banking
  corporation, some of it will finally trickle down to the workers.</p>

  <p>But can such a thing turn a crisis around with impunity? The stock market is merely
  a barometer, a surface manifestation of what is below. Can opening the gushers really
  change this? Can it stave off an economic crisis which is in the making?</p>

  <h4>Where it all leads</h4>

  <p>The basic aim is to keep capitalist production going, which inevitably leads to
  capitalist <strong>overproduction</strong> at a time when inventories are rising,
  consumer income is declining along with payrolls, and the general wage level is
  becoming more depressed with each technological restructuring of U.S. industry.</p>

  <p>All who lived through the late thirties, or who have studied the historical
  evolution of the Nazi and fascist economic measures, must wonder about the similarity
  to today.</p>

  <p>At the time there were many editorials in the New York Times, Washington Post and
  Los Angeles Times ridiculing the measures of the Hitler and Mussolini regimes, which
  were pumping billions of marks and lire into the economy. There were sorrowful articles
  about the poor economics minister, Hjalmar Schacht, who was a holdover from the Weimar
  Republic and knew better, but went along with Hitler's pump priming, printing more
  money and thus laying the basis for vast inflation.</p>

  <p>But Hitler said that his pump priming was different from the measures recommended by
  the "international bankers" for Germany, because his was for the "common good" of the
  German people.</p>

  <p>Let us look at the situation today. Is it fundamentally different from the
  pump-priming strategies of Hitler and Mussolini?</p>

  <h4>Why the dollar fell</h4>

  <p>No sooner had the New York stock market collapsed and the Federal Reserve announced
  its intention to intervene, than the dollar began to fall in all the currency markets
  of the world. Why? Because this pump priming by the Federal Reserve was nothing more
  than depreciation of the currency. It seems like a great space-age stratagem, but it
  comes straight from the old coin-clipping of the monarchs, when they controlled the
  gold holdings of the realm. This tactic invariably failed to enrich the royal treasury
  because the same clipped coins came back to the king in the form of taxes. This aspect
  of financial dealings has changed only in form with the transition from a feudal
  monarchy to a capitalist democracy.</p>

  <p>Many chickens are coming home to roost for the U.S. capitalist economy. The
  tremendous cost of Pentagon militarism no longer can be offset by the global expansion
  of U.S. economic and financial interests, for this has only led to the utterly
  impossible indebtedness of the oppressed countries. The use of military means to compel
  payment is out of the question.</p>

  <p>In addition, there is the specter of the rise of Japanese finance capital as the
  principal lender on the world financial arena. Its formidable challenge to U.S.
  competence in technology and managerial skills has raised inter-imperialist tensions to
  a fever pitch. It cannot forever be contained.</p>

  <p>Thus, no matter how many billions the Federal Reserve may throw down the rathole,
  there is no way the capitalist government can continue to stave off the inevitable day
  of reckoning.</p>
