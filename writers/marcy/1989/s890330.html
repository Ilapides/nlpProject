  <h1>Three routes, one destination for Eastern strike</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 30, 1989)</h5>

  <p>March 20 &mdash; The strike of the Eastern Airlines workers is bound to exercise a
  truly profound influence on the entire course of the U.S. labor movement.</p>

  <p>No strike in recent years has taken on such a momentous character as this one. By
  its scope and breadth, it has attracted the attention of millions upon millions of
  workers throughout the country, as well as abroad.</p>

  <p>When, following Jesse Jackson's lead, Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York said that the
  eyes of the country are upon the workers of Eastern, he was not exaggerating one bit.
  It now remains for the labor movement to prepare itself in every way possible to widen
  and deepen the course of the struggle.</p>

  <p>No one knows how long it will take, but there is a sense that a significant victory
  may at last be at hand if an aroused labor movement stands firm and strong, uninhibited
  by the wiles of the Bush administration and the courts.</p>

  <h4>The bankruptcy court route</h4>

  <p>At the moment it is the court battle which will be consuming a great deal of the
  interest of the union and all who are watching this strike. It is important not to be
  misled by the legal proceedings in bankruptcy court.</p>

  <p>Modern bankruptcy and reorganization procedures, especially by large corporations,
  are calculated to mystify and confuse the public in general, and the workers from the
  bankrupt corporation in particular.</p>

  <p>For hundreds of years the term bankruptcy has been identified correctly with fraud,
  deceit, depletion of assets, diversion of funds, stealing, robbery and criminality.</p>

  <p>Poor people who fell into debt got the harshest punishment with long prison terms.
  But the modern corporate giants have found an easy route to avoid the penalties that
  are meted out to the poor.</p>

  <p>It is not by accident that law firms specializing in bankruptcy and reorganization
  constitute one of the most lucrative elements of the legal profession. These Wall
  Street law firms with their allies and clients among the biggest bankers,
  industrialists and the government have turned bankruptcy and reorganization into a
  minor industry, which thrives not only during periods of capitalist recession but
  during periods of capitalist prosperity as well.</p>

  <p>An examination of any of the old railroad reorganizations would show how the
  bankruptcy attorneys drew some of the fattest retainers precisely because they were in
  cahoots with the railroad magnates themselves. However, the bankruptcy and
  reorganization attorneys are not the problem, they are merely one of its effects.</p>

  <p>The problem is the giant corporate monsters themselves that employ the bankruptcy
  and reorganization route not just to defraud creditors but to criminally assault the
  workers and deprive them of their rights as well as their livelihood.</p>

  <h4>Lorenzo the criminal bankrupt</h4>

  <p>According to Webster's Third New International Dictionary, a bankrupt is defined as
  "[2a] a person who to avoid payment, harbors debts, secretes himself, flees the
  country, or defrauds or simply avoids his creditors and is in consequence legally a
  criminal."</p>

  <p>This definition fits Frank Lorenzo perfectly. No, he does not secrete himself, he
  just keeps himself aloof and away from meeting the just demands of the unions. He
  hasn't fled the country but he is defrauding his principal creditor &mdash; the
  workers.</p>

  <p>The job rights of the workers constitute a property right in the company, as Frances
  Perkins, the Secretary of Labor under Roosevelt, defined the job rights of workers in
  the 1930s. The workers have a property right in their respective companies as a result
  of their employment.</p>

  <p>Depriving workers of their property right puts Lorenzo in the position of being a
  criminal as defined by Webster. It is his past conduct that reinforces the nature of
  his criminality. He's not the poor man who has stolen a loaf of bread for his family,
  but his bankruptcy declaration is meant to break the back of the workers. That's where
  his criminality stems from.</p>

  <h4>What Lorenzo wants from bankruptcy court</h4>

  <p>There should be no mystery about the nature of the legal proceedings in the
  bankruptcy courts if certain fundamentals are kept in mind. There are two types of
  bankruptcy proceedings. One is involuntary bankruptcy, where a given corporation is
  thrown into bankruptcy by its creditors against the will of the corporation. The other
  is voluntary bankruptcy. That's where the owners or chief executives of a corporation
  voluntarilyy file a petition asking the court to protect the corporation against its
  creditors and demand time from the court to reorganize to suit the owners. This is what
  Lorenzo has done.</p>

  <p>During this time, approximately 120 days according to present law, the corporation
  submits a plan showing how it can successfully reorganize and pay all its obligations.
  The court can then appoint a trustee to manage the corporation in the meantime. But
  Lorenzo doesn't want to submit to a trusteeship.</p>

  <p>What Lorenzo has demanded in this case is for the court to appoint an examiner to
  look over the company's plans. Lorenzo would continue to run the company more or less
  as he saw fit until his plan of reorganization had been accepted by the court. But a
  stop would be put to the payment of interest and indebtedness by the company.</p>

  <p>Assuming that Lorenzo's petition to appoint an examiner is denied (and it should be,
  because it is such a flagrant, arrogant demand), there remains the question of who
  would be the trustee.</p>

  <h4>Union can take over and run the airline</h4>

  <p>As Secretary Perkins long ago pointed out, the workers have an overriding property
  right in a corporation. If the company voluntarily throws itself into bankruptcy, the
  union then has the right to be appointed trustee, since it is the principal creditor
  and its rights supersede the rights of all other creditors.</p>

  <p>The creditors are divided by law into two groups &mdash; the secured and the
  unsecured creditors. All workers buying a car on time know that the bank can repossess
  the car for lack of due payment, most of the time without any notice. It is the same
  with airplanes. The mortgagees or the owners have the right to repossess them on the
  basis of nonpayment just as an auto finance company does.</p>

  <p>Once bankruptcy has been declared, however, they are forbidden to do that, and the
  question reduces itself to who among the so-called unsecured creditors &mdash;
  including the banks, finance companies and the union &mdash; will run the company. The
  union can demonstrate that the banks cannot and will not run the company. They can only
  do so if they get the consent of the union.</p>

  <p>The giant corporations which choose voluntary bankruptcy and reorganization should
  be distinguished from the great multitude of entrepreneurs, small businessmen and
  individuals who avail themselves of the bankruptcy provisions of the law. For the
  latter it is a matter of redress from insupportable debts.</p>

  <p>During periods of capitalist prosperity small businesses grow like mushrooms during
  the rain. They just as quickly disappear as soon as a capitalist recession begins to
  unfold. The mortality rate of small businesses and the number of bankruptcy petitions
  filed by them is staggering. The bankruptcy law was originally designed to give them
  some relief. This is to be distinguished from the large giant corporations for whom
  bankruptcy and reorganization are a means to undo the minor ones in times of
  crisis.</p>

  <p>Objectively, what we are seeing is the acceleration of the concentration of capital
  and the ruination of the small enterprises, who are either swallowed up or dissolved
  into even smaller units.</p>

  <h4>Lorenzo's record: bankruptcy just a union busting scam</h4>

  <p>The bankruptcy court is a court like any other. Lorenzo's petition for bankruptcy
  should have been denied immediately offhand, on the elementary equity principle of law
  which says that whoever demands relief from a court of general jurisdiction must come
  to court with clean hands.</p>

  <p>Lorenzo's hands are far from clean; they are bloodied. He criminally broke the
  strike of the Continental workers by filing for bankruptcy when he had no other reason
  for doing so than to get the court's approval to break the union.</p>

  <p>Much water has passed under the bridge since then. Because of the magnitude of
  Lorenzo's crime against the Continental workers, millions of workers and hundreds of
  unions fought to get the attention of Congress. The law was finally amended to make it
  illegal to utilize the bankruptcy court for strike breaking purposes.</p>

  <p>For Lorenzo to go to the court a second time should outrage the conscience of every
  progressive person. If he wins, it means giving the corporate barons a green light to
  continue to perpetrate this crime upon the working class community.</p>

  <h4>Cut through the rigmarole with mass action!</h4>

  <p>The first thrust of the labor movement should be to turn the legal proceedings into
  an arena of confrontation between capital and labor, between the working class and the
  capitalist class.</p>

  <p>There should be no mystery about the nature of the legal proceedings in the
  bankruptcy courts if certain fundamentals are kept in mind that can make short shrift
  of the long, exhausting and mostly incomprehensible legal rigmarole which only operates
  to demoralize the workers and not to enlighten them.</p>

  <p>What is needed at the court are <strong>huge solidarity demonstrations.</strong></p>

  <p>This doesn't mean to neglect presenting the union's case, or not taking the
  initiative to be appointed the legal trustee to operate and manage the firm on behalf
  of the workers.</p>

  <p>The stronger the support for the union among the workers, the easier it will be for
  the court to understand the need to dismiss Lorenzo's petition and to appoint the union
  to take over the company. It is the workers, after all, who have been operating and
  administering the company. This is a splendid opportunity to demonstrate to the whole
  world that it can and will be done.</p>

  <h4>The route of federal intervention</h4>

  <p>But this leaves open another route which is bound to consume a lot of attention from
  the public in general and the labor movement in particular &mdash; federal intervention
  by the Bush administration. This has taken the form of urging the Bush administration
  to appoint an emergency board to examine the Eastern Airlines strike and to issue
  recommendations for terms of settlement. Bush has declined to do so and Congressional
  efforts are being made to enact a law compelling Bush to appoint such a board.</p>

  <p>Once a board is appointed, the strike would be ended until the terms of settlement
  were named. This second route seems a lot more acceptable to many, but it is fraught
  with difficulties and dangers.</p>

  <p>The emergency board is picked by the president, who by this time is well known for
  his antiunion bias. George Bush is even opposed to a measly minimum wage increase and
  has been for a decade.</p>

  <p>But, assuming he does appoint a board, there is no obligation on him to choose a
  majority of pro-labor members, nor even anyone sympathetic to the demands of the
  workers. Nor are the recommendations the board makes binding.</p>

  <p>The link between the giant industrial companies and the capitalist state has never
  been more dramatically illustrated than in this particular bankruptcy and
  reorganization maneuver by Eastern Airlines.</p>

  <p>The association is so flagrant, so open, that even the Wall Street Journal felt
  obligated to take note of the links between the government and Texas Air, Eastern's
  parent company.</p>

  <h4>The route of worker solidarity</h4>

  <p>The third route is by far the most reliable and the one that will ultimately bring
  victory. That is to widen and deepen the support among the workers, especially in the
  field of transportation.</p>

  <p>Workers have a fundamental human right to demonstrate their solidarity with other
  workers, especially where their own living standards are endangered. The prohibition
  against sympathy strikes is an unconstitutional violation of the inalienable right of
  the workers to strike. It's a violation of the 13th Amendment which abolishes
  involuntary servitude. As long as the right to strike is limited at the will of the
  capitalist courts, involuntary servitude is being maintained.</p>

  <p>The right to strike was won not as a result of legislation. It was won as the result
  of struggle. The legislation was the effect of the struggle, and not vice versa. It
  took many decades to pass the Norris-LaGuardia anti-strikebreaking law that prohibits
  the federal courts from issuing injunctions in a labor dispute.</p>

  <p>The time has now ripened to abolish the right of courts to issue injunctions against
  sympathy strikes.</p>

  <p>At the present moment, a most urgent necessity is to demonstrate the solidarity of
  the workers' movement and particularly in the strategic transportation industry, by
  validating the right to a sympathy strike, which incidentally is legal in almost all
  other leading capitalist countries but is still banned in the U.S.</p>

  <p>It was mass action that nullified the bans against sympathy strikes in the leading
  capitalist countries. Only later were the laws changed to reflect this.</p>

  <p>The task calls for united labor action. It is wrong to divert the energies of the
  unions and of the workers into legal and governmental channels which have only limited
  value to the workers.</p>

  <p>What has been distinctly significant in this strike is the solidarity that has been
  shown first within the Machinists themselves, and secondly by the pilots. The next
  thing is to enlist other segments of the labor movement, beginning with those who are
  more directly affected by it &mdash; all forms of transportation.</p>

  <p>The government will get the message quickly. It is only the action of the workers
  that commands the attention of the government. Just one incident that illuminates the
  significance of mass action can be truly educational.</p>

  <p>Frank Lorenzo was due to get an award for his statesmanship in labor and management
  relations at Columbia University. Unbelievable as it sounds, no amount of reasoning, no
  amount of argument would change the opinion of the award givers. But mass action
  quickly turned it into something else. Not only was the award canceled, but many of the
  students and workers at Columbia turned out to support the Eastern workers.</p>

  <p>This small incident illustrates the significance of mass action, of the awakening of
  the labor movement.</p>
