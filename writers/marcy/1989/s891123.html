  <h1>Crucial issue in struggle over GDR course</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Nov. 23, 1989)</h5>

  <p>Now that the delirious celebrations of the imperialist bourgeoisie have died down
  somewhat, it is easier to see that the massive exodus resulting from the opening of the
  borders by the German Democratic Republic has not been the occasion for the kind of
  destabilization of the GDR which the ruling classes had anticipated.</p>

  <p>As they themselves have had to admit, most of those who crossed over from East to
  West Berlin went back by the time the weekend of Nov. 11-12 was over. Of course, some
  stayed, but it is the kind of phenomenon we have seen time and time again since the
  early post-war years. Some earlier border crossings were also of a threatening
  character, but the GDR survived them and the government and the socialist economy on
  the whole became strengthened.</p>

  <p>The Encyclopedia Britannica says about the GDR: "By the 1970s, the republic had
  attained a strong position economically and politically." This was "symbolized by an
  annual trade fair at Leipzig" that stimulated "trade between eastern and western and
  between northern and southern Europe." (Encyclopedia Britannica, Vol. 8, p. 6, 1982
  edition.) Has this economic position deteriorated since then? Of course not. Just this
  February and March, articles appeared in both the New York Times and the Wall Street
  Journal admitting that the GDR's socialist economy was prosperous and successful. (We
  quoted from these sources in our article last week.)</p>

  <h4>What is aim of imperialists?</h4>

  <p>The most important issue that faces the leadership of the GDR is an analysis of the
  nature of the crisis. Is it driven solely by domestic forces, or is it more in truth
  the result of the pressure of external forces? If so, what are these external
  forces?</p>

  <p>First and foremost is the imperialist bourgeoisie, especially the ruling classes of
  the U.S. and the Federal Republic of Germany, who are united in a common bond to
  utilize the crisis in the rest of Eastern Europe to impose their will on the GDR. What
  is their aim? <strong>It is the restoration of capitalism and the dismantling of the
  GDR as an independent republic.</strong></p>

  <p>If this is not clearly understood by the leadership and is not made clear to the
  Party and to the advanced workers and popular mass organizations, then the most
  hopeless confusion will prevail and the bourgeoisie will put across its program and
  attain its objective.</p>

  <p>Changing leadership in a crisis, changing horses in midstream, is almost always a
  dangerous course, especially in such a severe crisis. That having taken place, however,
  the question immediately arises: What is to be done?</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie is dictating a series of political changes in the hope that the new
  leadership will embark on the course of restoring a capitalist order within the GDR.
  All talk about free elections, about democracy, and so on and so forth, are merely
  catchwords, ploys, in order for the bourgeoisie to seize an opportunity to reestablish
  a capitalist order.</p>

  <p>What has taken place thus far are changes in the administration of the state. If a
  parallel could be drawn with bourgeois governments, it could be regarded as a fall of
  the government, meaning the administrators of the state, or even a shift from one party
  to another, but it does not affect the property relations because it is merely a
  political change. Moreover, it is merely a change of personnel within the same party.
  Even if it is true that a move from so-called hardliners to moderates may herald
  forthcoming changes in the economic system, this still has to be demonstrated.</p>

  <h4>Are elections incompatible with workers' rule?</h4>

  <p>So far as the political program of the new leadership goes, such as multi-party,
  free elections, etc., they are not inconsistent with socialism, with a workers' state,
  contrary to what the imperialist press has been saying.</p>

  <p>The Paris Commune (1871) was dedicated to having general elections and universal
  suffrage, but under the dictatorship of the working class. In the early days of the
  Bolshevik Revolution, the Communist Party was not opposed to universal suffrage or to
  the existence of other parties and popular elections. Why the Bolsheviks found it
  necessary to abolish the bourgeois Constituent Assembly was that the Soviets were more
  representative of the workers and the peasants and responsive to the defense of the
  proletarian revolution which had dislodged the bourgeoisie. Within the Soviets, there
  were regular elections and changes of leadership which reflected the shifts in
  revolutionary class consciousness of the masses.</p>

  <p>What would be wholly destructive of the GDR would be to accede to the demands of
  world imperialism and quickly rush through a general election without there being any
  preparation by the Party and the progressive organizations, especially under the
  psychological conditions which the imperialist bourgeoisie has prepared with its
  hysterical campaign.</p>

  <p>Let us pause and reflect on this. The issue really is not popular elections or
  multi-party elections. The issue is who chooses the moment for the elections. At the
  present time, the counterrevolutionary momentum in Eastern Europe, aided, abetted and
  engineered by the imperialist bourgeoisie, has created a mass psychosis. The masses
  have become disoriented in the face of a leadership which has been intimidated and
  frightened by the course of the struggle in the Eastern bloc.</p>

  <h4>Elections during a crisis</h4>

  <p>Let's look at it this way. In the seventies, there were two great opportunities for
  revolutionary overturns of the capitalist system and the seizure of power by working
  class parties, more specifically by Communist parties and their mass organizations.</p>

  <p>One was in Portugal, where the overthrow of the Salazar dictatorship opened the
  revolutionary road for the seizure of power by the proletariat and the peasants. But
  what actually happened, after much, much struggle, was that the bourgeois forces,
  inspired and engineered by the U.S. imperialist government, outmaneuvered the CP and
  its supporters. Instead of the seizure of power, the bourgeoisie promised elections
  &mdash; but not immediately, not when the revolutionary momentum of the working class
  was strong enough to overcome the bourgeoisie. The bourgeois politicians maneuvered
  first to create a new constitution, then commissions for election procedures, and then
  an election &mdash; <strong>after</strong> the revolutionary momentum had been
  dissipated and the counterrevolutionary elements had destroyed every possibility for a
  revolutionary seizure of power.</p>

  <p>In 1968, the French proletariat had an excellent opportunity to enforce its will on
  the bourgeoisie, but the bourgeoisie decided that then was not the moment to have a
  general election &mdash; right in the midst of a general strike, in the midst of a
  revolutionary momentum which inspired millions of workers and their supporters.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, de Gaulle rushed to West Germany and threatened to call back to
  France right-wing units of the French army stationed there &mdash; units whose
  commanders were identified with the neofascist secret army organization (OAS). It was a
  threat to drown the revolutionary momentum in blood. Of course, the bourgeoisie
  eventually agreed to an election &mdash; <strong>after</strong> the revolutionary
  momentum had been dissipated.</p>

  <p>These are only the most recent examples. The history of bourgeois parliamentarism is
  a history of deception and maneuver on how to corral the masses to support bourgeois
  domination in the name of democracy and freedom.</p>

  <p>It is always they who choose the moment and the conditions. In the event of a
  general crisis of the system, they abolish all forms of bourgeois parliamentarism and
  choose a naked, fascist dictatorship. Can we dare to forget this?</p>

  <h4>Wait out an ill wind</h4>

  <p>A working class party has the duty of carefully assessing the situation in the GDR
  without falling prey to panic. It needs to wait out an ill wind which for the moment
  has seized a section of the population and which in fact is the result of external
  forces. Under these conditions, the Party has the duty to employ the kinds of tactics
  and maneuvers which will best suit the preservation and strengthening of the socialist
  course, rather than lay the groundwork for surrender.</p>

  <p>In the course of the confusion and problems created by the counterrevolutionary
  trend in Poland and Hungary, one must not forget the very basics of the situation. What
  is the struggle all about? It is a struggle over the transfer of power from one class
  to another, a transfer of power from the working class to the bourgeoisie. That
  explains the joy, the delirium of the bourgeoisie at the prospect of this occurring in
  the GDR.</p>

  <p>But those sections of the imperialist bourgeoisie most joyous at the prospects of
  capitalist restoration in the GDR, are they not of the same ilk as the bankers and
  generals who, under the pretense of aiding the Red Army in the military struggle
  against Hitler, barbarously destroyed Dresden and needlessly leveled Berlin itself,
  with aerial bombardment? Not because they had to do it to defeat Hitler, but because
  they needed to obstruct the road to socialist revolution, because they feared a
  revolutionary development such as came on the heels of the collapse of the Hohenzollern
  regime in the First World War.</p>

  <p>These people who now speak with honeyed phrases about freedom and democracy would
  not hesitate to repeat this in the interests of super-profits, in order to make the GDR
  a dominion, a satellite in their geopolitical struggle against the USSR and against
  socialism.</p>

  <p>The reality is that the U.S. has 250,000 troops stationed in the Federal Republic of
  Germany, and there is not a whisper out of Washington that they will be removed. That
  is where power really lies, not in elections. That's what should be considered, rather
  than indulging in what Marx called "bourgeois parliamentary cretinism."</p>

  <p>The GDR leadership should be in a position to retain its political distance from the
  counterrevolutionary trend that has been set in motion by the developments in Hungary
  and Poland. Here we must not at all discount the pressure from the Gorbachev
  administration, which has been the single most important factor in stimulating the
  reactionary bourgeois trend in Eastern Europe, all capped by his visit to the GDR on
  the 40th anniversary of the founding of the republic.</p>

  <h4>Undemocratic removal of leaders</h4>

  <p>The changes in leadership in the GDR were made with the approval, if not the
  initiative &mdash; this must be admitted &mdash; of the Gorbachev administration. This
  undemocratic procedure runs against the very grain of socialist solidarity, of even
  fraternal relations between one socialist country and another. For this the Gorbachev
  administration will have to answer to history.</p>

  <p>That the GDR leadership has not reacted acrimoniously, has not been able to open a
  political counteroffensive against Gorbachev's bourgeois reforms and his efforts to
  extend and deepen them on a bloc-wide basis, can only be explained on the basis of the
  military exigencies of the GDR and of the relations of the Western imperialist
  occupiers of West Germany to the defense of the USSR and of the entire Eastern
  bloc.</p>

  <p>How is it that Berlin was divided in the first place? How did it come about that,
  virtually at the end of the Second World War, when the USSR had made the most
  spectacular military advances and had defeated the Nazi armies at the loss of millions
  of casualties, the Allied imperialists were allowed to set up their military
  administrations in West Berlin, 110 miles inside the territory liberated by the Red
  Army?</p>

  <p>When the Red Army entered Berlin, they launched a vast celebration of the victory
  over Nazism, along with hundreds of thousands of German communists and progressive
  anti-fascist elements. The Allied armies, on the other hand, had a celebration of their
  own at Reims, France. The two celebrations symbolized not just the victory over the
  Hitlerite regime, but were symbolic of the new status quo which might have issued from
  the Second World War.</p>

  <p>Why then did the USSR allow a military presence by the imperialists right in the
  heart of a territory won in the struggle, and in Berlin at that?</p>

  <h4>Berlin divided at Potsdam</h4>

  <p>It is said that this was the result of a compromise arrived at between the USSR and
  the Allied imperialists at Potsdam (see <em>Khrushchev Remembers,</em> Little, Brown
  &amp; Co., pp. 452-460). But why wasn't there a similar agreement to establish a
  military presence of all the Allies in Tokyo? Why wasn't Rome divided into sectors
  governed by each of the Allied powers, including the Soviet Union?</p>

  <p>This abnormal division of Berlin was first brought up at the London Conference of
  the Allies in 1944. But significantly, the USSR declined at the end to sign the
  agreement. Why was it agreed to in Potsdam?</p>

  <p>If we view this extraordinary, truly abnormal and arbitrary decision in purely
  military terms, we will never understand the principal motivations that lay behind it.
  The bourgeoisie wants to forget them. But the working class, particularly communist and
  anti-fascist leaders, dare not forget this.</p>

  <h4>Revolutionary struggles at war's end</h4>

  <p>Europe, certainly after the Battle of Stalingrad, was in the throes of virtual
  socialist revolution. It had become a revolutionary cauldron. The old regimes
  everywhere, especially the reactionary, collaborationist, aristocratic regimes, had
  collapsed. Some fled and became exile governments. In the heart of southeastern Europe,
  in Albania, Yugoslavia, and Greece, the old regimes were crushed by partisans of the
  revolutionary resistance.</p>

  <p>The Albanian and Yugoslav resistance went on to become the governments of their
  respective countries. The Greek resistance certainly would have taken over the country,
  had it not been for British tanks which were supported diplomatically by the U.S. and
  France. The Italian masses were armed and the anti-fascist resistance, led by the
  communists, had overthrown Mussolini. Could the imperialists forget something like
  that?</p>

  <p>The French resistance was also partially led by communists. Everywhere the old
  bourgeois order seemed to be on the verge of collapse. The enthusiasm of the masses for
  revolutionary change had reached a height rivaling that of the period at the end of the
  First World War. The problem of the imperialist bourgeoisie was more than military in
  character. It was how to contain the revolutionary momentum sweeping Europe.</p>

  <p>Even in Britain, which seemed to be insulated against the European revolutionary
  contagion, the Conservative Party led by Churchill was ousted by the Labor Party in a
  landslide victory.</p>

  <p>If one wishes to understand the insistence of the imperialists on having a military
  presence right in the heart of the capital, deep inside what was to become the GDR, one
  has to take into account these revolutionary developments. The need to contain them was
  a supreme political objective of imperialism.</p>

  <p>The fear that Germany would go communist under the revolutionary momentum in Europe
  was primary in the minds of the imperialist strategists. All sorts of ideas on how to
  prevent this were emanating from Washington and the European capitals, all under the
  pretext of eradicating Nazism. While that might have been the objective of some, the
  overall objective was to stop a European-wide proletarian revolution.</p>

  <p>The Morgenthau Plan, a concept of U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau,
  himself an international banker, was to completely deindustrialize Germany, thus making
  it dependent upon the West and at the same time disintegrating the working class as a
  factor. Other U.S. strategists urged that a reconstructed capitalist Germany would for
  a long time be the centerpiece of U.S. geopolitical domination of Europe.</p>

  <p>According to the imperialist interpretation, the division of Germany and the U.S.
  presence in Berlin were something in the nature of a divine dispensation. Actually,
  when the U.S. forces entered Berlin on July 1, 1945, they found "everything important
  to the running of the city already organized." (<em>The Death and Life of Germany,</em>
  Eugene Davidson, p. 75.) A complete municipal apparatus was already at work.</p>

  <p>There was no real need for them to set up a military administration. Nevertheless,
  an Allied Council was set up to discuss the nature of the peace treaty. It was never
  agreed that it should become a permanent military force, especially one acting as an
  obstruction to socialism in the heart of the capital.</p>

  <p>These concessions to the imperialists took place, it must be remembered, in the
  shadow of the atomic bomb, which had been successfully tested on July 16, 1945. Truman
  received word of it after he arrived at Potsdam.</p>

  <h4>The Berlin wall and Cuba</h4>

  <p>Why was the Berlin wall set up on Aug. 13, 1961? Because of harassment and
  provocations that began immediately after the Kennedy-Khrushchev meeting in Vienna that
  year. The U.S. administration was demanding that the USSR disengage itself from the
  Cuban Revolution, disavow any support of it, and let U.S. imperialism invade in full
  force. Otherwise, the U.S. would create a military confrontation in Europe. That's when
  the provocations began to take on momentum. Controlling the border became a severe
  problem because the U.S. saw it as a pressure point to force the USSR to relent on
  Cuba.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev-Bush summit: a repeat of Kennedy-Khrushchev Vienna summit?</h4>

  <p>One cannot properly discuss the building of the wall without reference to the world
  struggle, which at that point was becoming razor sharp and almost led to a nuclear
  confrontation over Cuba in October 1962. Is not the U.S. government demanding the same
  things of Gorbachev today? &mdash; to renounce anti-imperialist struggle. Is the
  upcoming summit going to be a rerun of the Kennedy-Khrushchev meeting in Vienna on June
  3, 1961? Or will it be, as the bourgeoisie is crowing about, a disguised surrender of
  Eastern Europe and specifically of the GDR?</p>

  <p>However, this expectation of theirs has yet to be demonstrated.</p>

  <p>Frightened by the counterrevolutionary trends to which he contributed so heavily and
  which he partially set in motion, Gorbachev was forced a bare three weeks before his
  summit meeting with Bush, to call for restraint by the imperialist bourgeoisie in
  exporting capitalism to Eastern Europe (New York Times and Washington Post Nov. 15).
  What else have the imperialists been doing except that?</p>

  <p>The imperialist bourgeoisie is showing no restraint whatever. They are moving ahead
  relentlessly. It will do no good, as Gorbachev did (Washington Post), to invoke the
  image of a common European home and admonish the imperialists not to upset the
  political balance in Europe or call for the reunification of Germany at the present
  time.</p>

  <p>The imperialists may be divided on whether to have a reunified imperialist Germany,
  but they are united on the restoration of capitalism in the GDR. Again it is pure
  nonsense to assert, as Gorbachev did, that there are not in the world today "two
  mutually exclusive civilizations, but one common civilization in which human values and
  freedom of choice have primacy."</p>

  <p>Resorting to such high-sounding florid phraseology covers up a grim reality. The
  U.S. showed on this very same day what they mean by freedom of choice and human values
  with the barbarous bombing that is going on in El Salvador at the behest of the
  Pentagon and the destruction of thousands of lives in the whole Central American area
  as witness the U.S.-backed contras against Nicaragua, not to forget the U.S.-supplied
  repression in south Korea and the Middle East</p>
