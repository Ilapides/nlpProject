  <h1>The new course<br />
  <small>in the USSR and Eastern Europe</small></h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Nov. 2, 1989)</h5>

  <p>October 25 &mdash; There can no longer be any doubt that the Soviet leadership is
  engaged in a massive effort to reorient its world relationships. This effort arises in
  consequence of the growing crisis generated by the bourgeois character of the social
  reforms which the Gorbachev administration has been so vigorously pushing, and which
  are daily proving impractical and unable to improve the daily life of the working
  masses.</p>

  <p>There is, of course, nothing wrong with the Soviet Union reviewing its foreign
  policy and attempting a reorientation. The question always is, in what direction? And
  to what concrete ends?</p>

  <p>General statements, especially when phrased in the lofty language of "human values"
  and the "universalization of contemporary life," shed very little light. Such phrases,
  more and more indulged in by the Soviet foreign policy establishment, do more to
  obscure than to enlighten.</p>

  <h4>Shevardnadze on Afghanistan</h4>

  <p>We must therefore look elsewhere for a clue as to where the USSR leadership is
  headed, both at home and abroad. It is in this connection that the speech made by
  Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to the Supreme Soviet on Oct. 23 is
  exceptionally illuminating.</p>

  <p>We regret that at this early date we are obliged to write about it without having at
  hand the full text of his speech. It is necessary to comment, however, because the
  imperialist press has given it wide coverage, showering it with effusive praise. From
  the excerpts available, we are able to cull out three vital points made by the Soviet
  foreign minister in his address. They have to do with Afghanistan, the Krasnoyarsk
  radar station, and Eastern Europe.</p>

  <p>Shevardnadze said about Soviet military assistance to Afghanistan that the USSR had
  "set ourselves against all of humanity, violated norms of behavior, ignored universal
  human values ... . At the time I am speaking about, M.S. Gorbachev and I were candidate
  [non-voting] members of the Politburo. I found out about what had happened from radio
  and newspaper reports. A decision that had very serious consequences for our country
  was made behind the back of the party and the people." (New York Times, Oct. 25.)</p>

  <p>It's hard to imagine a more damaging blow to the position of the USSR as a
  stronghold of anti-imperialist struggle and as a defender of friends and allies in the
  socialist camp than this indictment by Shevardnadze of the previous administration for
  initiating what he clearly implies was an illegal and immoral adventure.</p>

  <p>This in the tenth year of a bloody war, the end of which is not yet in sight!</p>

  <p>The only result of his remarks will be to strengthen the imperialist resolve and
  weaken the position of the USSR. This ingratiating terminology will not change U.S.
  foreign policy one iota.</p>

  <p>As the so-called "liberal" former CIA director from the Carter administration,
  Admiral Stansfield Turner, put it when asked, after the U.S. had shot down a civilian
  Iranian airliner with great loss of life, what the U.S. ought to do next in light of
  this tragic development, the answer was, "Hit 'em when they're down." And this from the
  so-called liberal wing of the Pentagon.</p>

  <p>So what good does it do to indict the previous leadership for its policy of
  extending military aid to the besieged Afghan revolutionary government?</p>

  <p>Was it correct in principle, from the viewpoint of the anti-imperialist struggle, to
  extend aid to the Afghan government? Yes or no? Even if the decision was a mistake,
  wasn't it purely from the point of view of wrongly assessing the situation surrounding
  the Afghan Revolution? And even if it was an adventurous act, shouldn't this be first
  discussed internally in the party and then the results of the discussion be brought to
  the public? This has not been done.</p>

  <p>To say that in 1979 the decision was taken behind the back of the party and the
  people, as he puts it, is an indictment of the so-called small group that made the
  decision. This group, according to other Soviet accounts, was made up of General
  Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, KGB head Yuri V. Andropov, Foreign Minister Andrei A.
  Gromyko, Defense Minister Dmitri F. Ustinov, Prime Minister Aleksei N. Kosygin, and
  ideology chief Mikhail A. Suslov. Were any of these leaders, all having long experience
  in dealing with foreign policy and/or military matters, likely candidates for rash or
  adventurous action abroad?</p>

  <h4>1979: "Committee on the Present Danger"</h4>

  <p>What was the external situation, the so-called geopolitical considerations, at that
  time? The SALT II treaty had just been signed, with hopes that the U.S. Senate would
  soon ratify it, but this proved entirely unfounded. Instead, dozens of U.S. generals
  and admirals, many of them retired, took the offensive to scuttle it. The sudden rise
  of the Committee on the Present Danger indicated that the Pentagon and the capitalist
  establishment as a whole were in no mood for serious arms limitations in the face of a
  new capitalist economic crisis.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Pentagon was searching for areas in which to engage the Soviet Union in
  order to divert the recent revolution in Iran into a confrontation with the East. One
  only has to remember the series of planted articles in the capitalist press at that
  time about the need to divert the fires of Moslem fundamentalism to the East, toward
  the Soviet Union. The imperialist press also looked for an affinity between the Moslem
  population in northern Iran and in Azerbaijan. They wrote scare stories about the
  proximity of the Soviet Union to the oil fields of Iran.</p>

  <p>Then came the U.S.-sponsored insurgency, which endangered the Afghan Revolution and
  threatened to put a U.S. imperialist military base on the Soviet border. When the
  Soviet government received as many as 14 separate calls for aid from Kabul, weren't
  these the considerations weighing heavily on the Soviet leaders, rather than some
  personal bent in the direction of adventurism?</p>

  <p>Shevardnadze is attempting to throw the onus for the decision on the old leadership,
  all of whom are now dead and for whom no one dares stand up (which in itself is an
  indication of the character of the democracy under Gorbachev). But this will in no way
  ameliorate U.S. foreign policy. On the contrary, it will only embolden them.</p>

  <h4>Why raise Krasnoyarsk?</h4>

  <p>Even more so with the so-called confession about the Krasnoyarsk radar station,
  which Shevardnadze now says was "built on the wrong site" and represented "a violation
  of the ABM Treaty." This is a totally inexplicable red herring, thrown in to discredit
  the deceased Defense Minister Ustinov, who was the main figure in what might be called
  the military-industrial complex at the time.</p>

  <p>It's all the more gratuitous because a U.S. congressional delegation composed of
  Rep. Thomas J. Downey (D-NY), Jim Moody (D-Wis.), and Bob Carr (D-Mich.) visited
  Krasnoyarsk and said in September 1987: "We judge it to be not a violation of the ABM
  treaty at this time." Furthermore, the Soviet Union has already agreed to dismantle it.
  So what's the point of bringing it up again after the U.S. had apparently lost
  interest? It can only be explained on the basis of trying to discredit the military
  people who participated in the decision.</p>

  <p>Dismantling Krasnoyarsk is unquestionably connected with the need to cut down on
  military spending. But this is an utterly unprincipled way in which to bring up the
  issue.</p>

  <p>Cuts in military spending and the deployment of military forces are not entirely new
  phenomena in the USSR. They occurred immediately after the Civil War, when many forces
  were demobilized, and again after the Second World War. Further cuts would have been
  made had the Pentagon not become so belligerent toward the Soviet Union after its
  success with dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nevertheless, cuts
  were made from 1945 to 1955, as well as during the Khrushchev period.</p>

  <p>All this was done without having to indulge in bourgeois pacifism or deliberately
  fomenting an inner struggle over military spending. What is needed is a principled
  discussion of how to balance defense needs with civilian needs, how to convert military
  plants to civilian purposes, which is a considerable problem. Instead, the discussion
  is proceeding in the spirit of bourgeois pacifism.</p>

  <p>There is also pressure to develop a professional army as against universal military
  service. The latter is the democratic way of meeting the defense needs of a socialist
  country. A professional army strengthens a military caste system.</p>

  <h4>Euphemism for counterrevolution in Eastern Europe</h4>

  <p>Finally, in regard to Eastern Europe, Shevardnadze said there must be "recognition
  of each country's absolute freedom of choice," and characterized the
  counterrevolutionary developments in both Hungary and Poland as the entry of
  "alternative forces" into the political arena.</p>

  <p>The entire bourgeoisie, from Finland to Tokyo, are as clear as a bell in seeing that
  in both Poland and Hungary these are counterrevolutionary developments. But
  Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, talks about "alternative forces."</p>

  <p>It means that Gorbachev and his cohorts are deliberately disengaging themselves from
  their most intimate allies and throwing them to the wolves. Wasn't this the upshot of
  Gorbachev's appearance at the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic?</p>

  <p>Is there any method to this madness? Is it really possible that the bourgeois forces
  led by Solidarity, which Jaruzelski and the Polish party called an outright
  counterrevolution only a few years ago, are now to be embraced as friendly allies?</p>

  <p>All this leads to one conclusion. The projected reorientation of the USSR's world
  relations is in the direction of a new form of accommodation with U.S. imperialism at
  the expense of the anti-imperialist movement and its socialist allies.</p>

  <h4>The "condominium" theory</h4>

  <p>This view is borrowed from one of the cherished bourgeois theories of Henry
  Kissinger and his think tank. This projects the formation of a new axis in the world
  struggle for supremacy. These bourgeois theorists see a new and greater threat to U.S.
  hegemony than the U.S.-Soviet world struggle: the emergence of Japanese imperialism as
  the principal creditor nation in the world and as the financial, commercial and
  technological rival of the U.S. A secondary challenger to U.S. ambitions is the
  emergence of a so-called united European capitalist community.</p>

  <p>It is assumed by these geopoliticians that as the strength of Japanese finance
  capital grows, as well as that of the European Economic Community, the difficulties of
  U.S. imperialism could become insurmountable unless they find a new axis of struggle
  against the Europeans and the Japanese. What better than a "condominium" of the two
  "superpowers," who together would be able to subordinate the growing might of the
  Euro-Asian bloc! Such is the vision of the Kissingers, the Eagleburgers, and some of
  the so-called soft-liners in the Bush administration.</p>

  <p>It would be the height of naiveté for Gorbachev, Shevardnadze and their new
  crop of advisers to fall for this malarkey. What appeals to them, however, is the
  thought that if the Soviet Union can relieve itself of its fraternal, revolutionary
  responsibilities to the anti-imperialist movement and disengage itself from its East
  European fraternal allies, then a U.S.-USSR condominium could become an established
  fact of world politics.</p>

  <h4>There is one big problem</h4>

  <p>What stands in the way of this alluring fantasy? It is the impossibility of
  liquidating the class antagonism between imperialism and the USSR. The two social
  systems, notwithstanding the erosion that has enveloped the USSR as a result of the
  bourgeois economic reforms brought in by the Gorbachev grouping, are from a class point
  of view utterly irreconcilable. And none of the serious bourgeois thinkers forget it
  for a moment. None of the honeyed phrases that flow from the bourgeois press in praise
  of the Gorbachev administration can cover up this yawning abyss.</p>

  <p>The illusions being fostered in the USSR are based not just on this phantasmagoria
  but on the wishful thinking that the U.S. capitalist government is going to open up its
  treasury as well as its technological warehouse and say to the USSR, "Here it is! We'll
  give you what you need!"</p>

  <p>This is 90% fraud and 10% wishful thinking on both sides. What Shevardnadze should
  have done in his speech to the Supreme Soviet, instead of delving into past factional
  struggles in order to envenom the present ones, was to explain to the Supreme Soviet
  the details of his conversations with Secretary of State James Baker in Jackson Hole,
  Wyoming. That would have been illuminating. But alas! Such information is confined to a
  very small group, to which the party and the Supreme Soviet are not privy.</p>

  <p>He also should explain the extraordinary visit to Moscow of Alan Greenspan, head of
  the U.S. Federal Reserve system, which is much more significant than a junket by some
  secondary statesman from the imperialist countries.</p>

  <p>What was the content of those conversations? Is it really necessary to get the
  advice of a U.S. central banker on reforming the Soviet banking system? This is a
  hopeless utopia. How can the imperialist countries help solve the economic problems in
  the Soviet Union when they result from trying to foist capitalist market and property
  forms on a basically centralized, socialist system which is being eroded day by
  day?</p>

  <p>The two are incompatible and irreconcilable. One or the other will achieve supremacy
  in the end. There cannot be any resolution of this problem on the basis of patchwork
  and compromise.</p>

  <p>It is now almost five years into the Gorbachev administration, and it has been shown
  that his reforms are unworkable. There is a burning and imperative need to return to
  socialist construction, and this in turn calls for reliance on the working class, the
  only class in Soviet society which is consistently for socialism. Together with the
  collective peasantry, it is invincible.</p>
