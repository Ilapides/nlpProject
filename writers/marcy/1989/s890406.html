  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Yeltsin and the Soviet election (April 6,
  1989)</title>

<body>
  <h1>Yeltsin and the Soviet elections</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 6, 1989)</h5>

  <p>In analyzing the Soviet elections at this early date, only some tentative
  conclusions are possible. We reserve for later a more comprehensive analysis when the
  detailed tabulations are made available.</p>

  <p>Suffice it to say that the results thus far are a blow to Gorbachev's policy of
  restructuring. This is notwithstanding that many from the opposition who got elected
  have claimed restructuring as their program, but they want it to go much further and
  faster.</p>

  <p>The issue really is what do the masses expect from restructuring, what is the
  meaning of reforming the Soviet economy?</p>

  <p>It is now four long years into the restructuring process inaugurated by the
  Gorbachev administration, and the situation insofar as living conditions go,
  particularly in the food and consumer areas, has gotten worse according to Gorbachev's
  own estimate. He has overhauled what he said was a top-heavy agricultural bureaucracy,
  not once but twice, yet no alleviation of the situation is in sight.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it is best to begin an analysis of the election results with the critically
  important October 1987 Politburo meeting.</p>

  <h4>Democratic centralism and the Politburo</h4>

  <p>Notwithstanding Gorbachev's bold words against bureaucracy and undemocratic
  procedures, the conduct of the Politburo itself is not anything like the Leninist
  conception of the practice of democratic centralism.</p>

  <p>It was traditional during the Leninist period that when serious issues of principle
  were at stake, discussions at the Politburo level were publicized. As a matter of
  democratic centralist procedure, disagreements were clearly defined in written
  documents, without fear of punishment or reprisal.</p>

  <p>The history of the Bolshevik Party during Lenin's lifetime is replete with polemics
  among the different tendencies within the Party, right, left and center. It is true
  that not everything can be solved merely by following democratic procedure, but it does
  help the mass of the Party and the people to assess the differences if written
  positions are formulated by each of the groupings or the individuals involved.</p>

  <p>Of course, there has always been a certain amount of evasion in presenting these
  positions, but nevertheless they afford some guide for the Party membership as well as
  for the mass of workers and peasants.</p>

  <p>This procedure was totally abolished in the post-Leninist era. One would have hoped
  that when Gorbachev began his administration with such loud denunciations of
  anti-democratic procedures and command and administrative practices, he would have
  reintroduced it where it counts so heavily, in the Politburo itself. This would not
  only raise the prestige of the Politburo but would also focus attention on the critical
  issues the Party and the government have to deal with.</p>

  <h4>Circumstances of Yeltsin's expulsion from Politburo</h4>

  <p>Hence the importance of the October 1987 Politburo meeting. It was there that the
  differences between right, left and center broke out, as we learned later. (The terms
  right, left and center are used here advisedly, in the sense that Boris Yeltsin is
  considered to represent the right wing, Gorbachev the center, and Ligachev and some of
  his supporters the left within the communist movement.)</p>

  <p>But none of them have presented their positions in documentary form or given any
  exhaustive exposition of their views. All of them put themselves under the old
  monolithic facade of unanimity, so that Politburo meetings are conducted in secret and
  only the results are published in vague form without any hint of differences &mdash; at
  a time when there are such grave political problems.</p>

  <p>The public learned subsequently that differences between Yeltsin and Gorbachev over
  restructuring broke out unexpectedly. Instead of making public a definitive or even
  tentative exposition of their views, it ended in an organizational brawl with
  name-calling and rudeness. Yeltsin was dropped from the Politburo for what was later
  explained as overweening ambition, egoism, etc. &mdash; a purely subjective
  approach.</p>

  <p>Even if all this were true, it only masks deeper political differences over the
  course of restructuring. The Politburo did not explain why this formerly strong ally of
  Gorbachev had suddenly become insolent and overbearing.</p>

  <p>Dropping a Politburo member where there are obvious political differences is
  anti-Leninist and anti-democratic in character. During the Lenin period, there were
  times the majority was against him &mdash; most notably during the Brest-Litovsk
  negotiations. It is a gross distortion of democratic centralism to drop an elected
  member of the Politburo without referring it back to the Central Committee.</p>

  <p>Most of all, it is politically harmful, especially to the cause of communist
  political and theoretical practice in the building and strengthening of the Party.
  Since Yeltsin was the spokesperson for the right wing, his purge from the Politburo
  deprived that body of a spokesman for the right, which, from the point of view of the
  Politburo itself, it needed in order to assess the continuing debate over the fate of
  restructuring.</p>

  <p>Dropping him from the Politburo didn't solve the problem of a right-wing opposition;
  it merely weakened the bureau. Moreover, Gorbachev demonstrated his arrogance and lack
  of sensitivity to the repercussions this would have in Yeltsin's constituency.</p>

  <h4>Effect on Moscow Party</h4>

  <p>Yeltsin, it need hardly be remembered, was the head of the Moscow Party, possibly
  the strongest and most politically articulate section of the country. Moscow, Leningrad
  and several other cities are the most cosmopolitan in the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>Removing a Politburo member who represents the Moscow constituency is a very serious
  matter. Gorbachev, who endlessly talks about learning from history, shows how little he
  really understands about all this.</p>

  <p>When Stalin was faced with the opposition of Moscow and Leningrad, represented by
  Zinoviev and Kamenev, respectively, he knew enough on the basis of his factional
  instincts not to remove them abruptly. On the contrary, he moved slowly. Of course, the
  political positions were aired fairly clearly under those circumstances,
  notwithstanding Stalin's arbitrary and bureaucratic behavior.</p>

  <p>What he did do, of course, which was much worse, was to slowly destroy the basis for
  their representation, by lies and by slander. But he knew one thing: that one cannot
  summarily remove the leaders of each of these cities without taking into calculation
  all of the consequences and planning for it over a period of time.</p>

  <p>Thus, hastily removing Yeltsin laid the basis for strengthening and widening his
  popular support. Here it is necessary to take note of the deft hand of the imperialist
  press and how they explain such an event.</p>

  <p>In earlier times, they would have castigated Gorbachev as being in the Stalin mold,
  putting Yeltsin in the role of a purged victim of Stalinist practices. But the
  capitalist press worldwide, it must be remembered, prefers Gorbachev as against, for
  instance, Ligachev or an earlier version of the traditional, pro-Stalin leader. So
  while they deplored Yeltsin's ouster, they nevertheless regarded it as merely an
  episodic event. They only mildly criticized Gorbachev, since it's on him that the
  bourgeoisie stakes their so-called new era of peaceful coexistence.</p>

  <p>It is to be remembered that Gorbachev showed this same impulsiveness and
  overconfidence when he summarily dismissed D.A. Kunayev, the Communist Party leader in
  Kazakhstan, and replaced him with an ethnic Russian. This caused a massive rebellion
  and opened up the era of nationalist revival, after so many years in which the Soviet
  Union had cultivated the Leninist policy on internationalism among the republics.</p>

  <p>By removing Yeltsin, Gorbachev not only weakened the Politburo by depriving it of
  someone who could articulate the views of the right, but he also strengthened Yeltsin's
  constituency in this most cosmopolitan and politically alert city.</p>

  <p>During the Leninist period, relations between the political centers, such as Moscow
  and Petersburg (now Leningrad), and the outlying provinces were of particular concern
  to the success of Bolshevism with respect to the national question and the relations
  between the peasantry and the proletariat. The Moscow and Leningrad Bolsheviks went out
  of their way to demonstrate solicitude for the outlying provinces and republics, with
  their aspirations of equality, as a means of solidifying the class solidarity of the
  proletariat and peasantry.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev's handling of these problems shows that he neither remembers nor knows how
  to evaluate in Leninist terms the relationship between the central political cities and
  the republics. In the Yeltsin affair, he also forgot about the role of the central
  cities, where political tendencies emerge first.</p>

  <p>In removing Yeltsin from the Politburo, he humiliated not only the Moscow Party
  organization but the city as such, where Yeltsin had become a sort of favorite son.
  None of this was given a great deal of attention at the 19th Party Conference held last
  summer.</p>

  <p>At that time, Yeltsin asked to be rehabilitated, and apologized for any remarks or
  conduct that might have caused the Politburo to relieve him of his post. This of course
  was not in the spirit of communist debate, theory or practice, which calls above all
  for frankness in stating one's own position boldly and clearly.</p>

  <p>Everything in Marxism and Leninism speaks against these abject confessions, 99% of
  which are false and in the spirit of cringing before authority, failing to boldly state
  one's position, come what may. The Politburo members sitting at the podium then
  commenced an attack on him, all based on purely organizational and personal matters
  which do not bear any relationship to the issues.</p>

  <p>Intoxicated by their success in getting approval for the projected reforms,
  Gorbachev and his colleagues rejected Yeltsin's plea to be readmitted to the Politburo.
  This too was a mistake, and follows the logic of their previous positions: not
  disclosing what the real problems and positions are, retaining the authority of the
  Politburo members to arbitrarily drop members without stated political differences and
  in disregard of the district communists, that is, Yeltsin's base and constituency.</p>

  <h4>Both a supporter and opponent</h4>

  <p>Thus, if one is to examine the basis for Yeltsin's 89% vote in Moscow (5.1 million
  votes), one has to attribute a great deal of his success to the policy pursued by the
  centrist Gorbachev grouping which controls the Politburo. Yeltsin was able to conduct
  his agitation with an election campaign in which he posed first of all as a strong
  supporter of Gorbachev and at the same time as an opponent.</p>

  <p>Many communists were outraged at his being ousted from the Politburo without any
  sufficiently stated political basis, and at his shabby treatment at the conference. One
  would have anticipated that after he pleaded recognition of his organizational
  mistakes, there would be unity and he would be returned to the fold.</p>

  <p>So as matters stood when the election campaign began, Yeltsin was able on the basis
  of his own vague position to pull votes from both sides. Gorbachev's supporters were
  apparently at a loss on how to proceed in his case. The bourgeois elements who
  understood Yeltsin's program best of all campaigned most arduously for him.</p>

  <p>The considerable grouping in Moscow which is disenchanted with the Party and is
  actually for the bourgeois character of the reforms constituted the main detachment of
  his supporters. But despite the interpretation of the Western press, the vote was not
  for the most part anti-communist. He also appealed to the conservative element, that
  is, the traditional communists, and to many workers who listened to his demagogy about
  better housing, against privileges for the Party leadership, and so on. Above all, he
  threw the onus for the failure of the restructuring efforts on the old Party apparatus,
  at the same time covertly attacking the Gorbachev administration, of which he was no
  longer a part.</p>

  <p>It's a classic case of a centrist administration, which needs right-wing support
  against the left, being unable to deal vigorously or affirmatively with an opponent
  from the right.</p>

  <p>Finally, Yeltsin himself could not have selected a candidate to oppose him who could
  be an easier target for his demagogy. Let us look at the contest between Yeltsin and
  Yevgeny Brakov, considered the official Party candidate. Who is Brakov?</p>

  <h4>Director of limousine factory</h4>

  <p>He is the director of the Zil limousine factory, the symbol of the highest
  privileges in the USSR, a country where the overwhelming majority do not yet have a
  modest automobile.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin as a member of the bureaucracy has one, yet nevertheless utilized this for
  demagogic purposes. The limousines are very visible in Moscow, as are long queues for
  necessary items. The contrast could not be greater.</p>

  <p>But that is only one aspect of it. The other aspect is that he is a director of a
  plant. The directors during the Leninist regime were mere employees of the government
  and their authority was limited to their technical ability and managerial skills.
  Later, a so-called troika was formed for decision-making, composed of the manager or a
  sub-managerial staff, the Party representative in the plant, and either the union or a
  representative from the workers' council. The manager had no authority for hiring or
  firing.</p>

  <p>All this has been changed. The managers now have vastly increased their authority,
  including that of hiring and firing, and the unions serve more in an advisory capacity,
  functioning more in the field of social insurance than in the day-to-day life of the
  workers.</p>

  <p>While today the manager is often a member of the Party committee, he stands in
  opposition to the workers rather than as a representative of them in any way. In most
  cases, managers are hated by the workers. Whereas in the old days managers used to sit
  and observe Party proceedings, at the last Party Conference 570 of the delegates were
  managers.</p>

  <p>A Leninist of the old school would find it unbelievable that at a Party Conference,
  directors instead of workers were representing the Party.</p>

  <h4>Centrist tendency loses out</h4>

  <p>Although the results nationwide are still very tentative, it nevertheless is very
  clear that Gorbachev's centrist tendency has lost out in the cities of Moscow,
  Leningrad, Kiev, Lvov, Minsk and Kishinev. The vote against the secretary of the Party
  in Leningrad, Yuri Solovyov, is particularly significant. He is not a holdover from the
  Brezhnev period but was brought in by Gorbachev himself in 1986. True, he is not a full
  Politburo member but only a non-voting alternate. Nevertheless, what was at stake here
  was Gorbachev's prestige.</p>

  <p>What the election results show, even if tentatively, is massive dissatisfaction by
  the popular masses as a result of the hardships caused by the bourgeois character of
  the reforms, which the right-wing communists and the bourgeois elements have hitherto
  been blaming on the old conservative Party leadership. This might have gone over very
  well in 1985, 1986 or even 1987, but it is now four years into the bourgeois reforms
  and there is no end in sight to the hardships caused by them.</p>

  <p>Those bourgeois elements who understand this very well are blaming it on the meager
  character of the reforms. They want to go the whole hog with bourgeois restorationist
  schemes.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev administration, which cannot and will not stop after having set them
  in motion, is being dragged further along the road. The leftist elements, those who may
  be represented by the Ligachev tendency, are neither articulate in expounding their
  view nor are they in the forefront as supporters of the Gorbachev administration.</p>

  <p>What is the situation right now? The USSR is like a vast ocean liner somewhat
  adrift, destination unknown. The gravitational pull of its economic system, its basic
  class structure, the foundation of public ownership of the basic means of production,
  is toward the further development of socialism, toward moving into a higher stage.</p>

  <h4>Two opposite pulls</h4>

  <p>The other pull is back towards bourgeois norms, deriving from the unfinished
  socialist character of agriculture and other fields of consumer production where a
  bourgeois economy still prevails. The ideal of the bourgeois restorationist trend is
  the small enterprise, the family farm, the private cooperative.</p>

  <p>This is a weak sector that cannot gain the confidence of the proletariat. The petty
  entrepreneurs are the object of derision and hatred from the large mass of the
  people.</p>

  <p>The source of inequality is in the field of distribution, which is still based on
  bourgeois norms. This would not be an overriding obstacle if the superstructure of the
  USSR were not based upon privilege and inequality, which pulls away from socialism. At
  the same time, the superstructure and the political rule of the bureaucracy rests
  precisely on the socialized sector and government ownership of the means of production,
  which has broad support from the workers.</p>

  <p>Should a crisis develop, it will be the bureaucracy that will go and not the
  economic foundations of socialist construction.</p>

  <p>The reforms the bourgeois elements are trying to foist upon the USSR are like
  attempts to put a saddle on a cow. It simply will not work. On the other hand, the
  imperialist bourgeoisie and some of the bourgeois economists in the USSR like Shmelyov,
  Abalkin, and others see public ownership of the means of production as the basic
  insurmountable obstacle which must first be dismantled.</p>

  <p>They want to break up an ocean liner into a myriad of small rowboats. That's also
  the free enterprise view of the imperialist bourgeoisie for the USSR.</p>

  <p>It won't happen. A reaction against the innovators is bound to reemerge, not in the
  form of the old Party hierarchy but as a new, thoroughly working class-oriented
  tendency that sees the historic mission of the USSR as towards further socialization,
  not back to the old discredited bourgeois norms.</p>
