  <p>General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev could not but have known that once he embarked
  upon his restructuring program, which has introduced into the Soviet economy deep and
  profound reforms of a thoroughly bourgeois character, this would eventually stimulate
  old, almost forgotten, as well as new nationalist sentiments. The very nature of the
  economic reforms fosters private interests, not only of individuals but of groupings,
  which then spill over into national animosities.</p>

  <h4>Kazakhstan was a warning</h4>

  <p>Perhaps only time was necessary to prove this. But it is now over two years since
  the December 1986 rebellion in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan, which followed the replacement of
  the Party leader there by an ethnic Russian. The brutal manner of the dismissal of
  Dinmukhamed A. Kunayev must have shocked the entire community of nationalities in the
  Soviet Union. Did the central leadership learn anything from this?</p>

  <p>Gorbachev, the great innovator and experimenter, with his new thinking, seemed to
  move merrily on, disregarding the profound significance of the Alma-Ata rebellion and
  the great sentiment it undoubtedly aroused throughout all the non-Russian areas of the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>The Politburo, instead of directing its attention to the national question as the
  political area which would be most affected by economic decentralization, with its
  stimulation of group rivalry and renewed struggle for privilege and emoluments, tarried
  and buried its head.</p>

  <p>There is documentary proof in the Party debates and resolutions of the early 1920s
  that the New Economic Policy, especially after the death of Lenin, adversely affected
  relations among the nationalities. The outbreak of speculation and profiteering on the
  basis of the new market developments favored the more advanced, that is, the more
  bourgeois economic interests, as against the mass of the proletarians and the poor
  peasants. This was a matter of considerable worry to the Bolsheviks. (See <a href=
  "../perestroika/perehtml/13.html">Gorbachev's response to the crisis over
  Nagorno-Karabakh</a> in <em>Perestroika</em> [Aug. 11, 1988].)</p>

  <p>None of this, however, seems to have been considered today by the Gorbachev
  leadership. Instead, there have been paeans of praise for the New Economic Policy and
  gross exaggerations of its enduring significance, despite the fact that it was
  undertaken on a temporary basis and only because of the desperate needs of the 1920s,
  as Lenin outlined. As he said again and again, the question at that time was, who will
  conquer whom? Would the bourgeoisie or the proletarian dictatorship win? But none of
  this is remembered, even after the Kazakhstan rebellion.</p>

  <h4>Then came Armenia and Azerbaijan</h4>

  <p>Then came the Azerbaijani-Armenian struggle. It struck like thunder. And what was
  the attitude of Gorbachev and his colleagues? It was treated as a minor incident
  between two small nationalities, arising out of ancient animosities &mdash; the kind of
  explanation one would expect of a bourgeois, a czarist or an imperialist government.
  Instead of taking the matter quickly in hand and applying himself in the spirit of
  proletarian internationalism, Gorbachev in particular took it upon himself to act as a
  mediator. At the same time he fanned the flames of national rivalry by scolding the
  leadership in each group, blaming everything on the local leaders.</p>

  <p>This is totally superficial. The antagonisms have blown up at this time because of
  the introduction of reforms which stimulate private economic gain. Whatever the
  problems of the previous regimes, they did not occasion the kinds of uprisings we are
  seeing now.</p>

  <p>Take the question of Nagorno-Karabakh, the small enclave inhabited by a majority of
  Armenians which for close to seven decades remained an uncontested part of
  Azerbaijan.</p>

  <p>Who in Armenia but the neo-bourgeois elements would have the greatest interest in
  Nagorno-Karabakh becoming a part of the Armenian Socialist Republic? Isn't this attempt
  to grab a geographic and economic enclave an expression of bourgeois acquisitiveness,
  totally contrary to what was agreed upon in the formation of the Union of Soviet
  Socialist Republics?</p>

  <p>The Armenian-Azerbaijani struggle was the clear forerunner of the present situation
  in Soviet Georgia, where massive demonstrations have been answered with stupid
  repression and the use of the military and tanks.</p>

  <h4>Shevardnadze sent to Soviet Georgia</h4>

  <p>Now Soviet Foreign Minister Edouard Shevardnadze, the only Georgian in the top Party
  leadership, has been sent there as a trouble-shooter. How humiliating it must be for
  the foreign minister of such a great multinational state to have to cancel his visit to
  the German Democratic Republic (a socialist country where the bourgeois reforms are
  regarded with open skepticism) in order to attend to a local matter from which he has
  been far removed. There's no question that his being pulled into the Georgian struggle
  at this time is a desperate measure.</p>

  <p>What could and should have been done?</p>

  <p>Immediately after the Kazakhstan rebellion, in the light of the new program of
  bourgeois reforms which was already fairly advanced, the question should have been
  raised of how these were impacting upon the nationality question in the USSR. A
  principal issue for the Party leadership should have been how to deal with it in view
  of the fact that economic decentralization clearly comes into conflict with the needs
  of a unified socialist state.</p>

  <p>Socialist construction on a multinational scale, let alone a world federation of
  socialist states, clearly requires democratic, socialist centralism. However, bourgeois
  private property-seeking economic reforms, especially decentralization and the setting
  up of private cooperatives, clearly have a centrifugal character which can do havoc to
  the whole national economy.</p>

  <p>The latest decree on the reforms by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, unless it
  was falsely represented in the capitalist press (New York Times, April 10), goes far
  beyond what had hitherto been practiced. It allows long-term land leases of 50 years or
  more, sub-leasing and passing the land on by inheritance, the leasing of farm animals
  and even factories, and the private building of homes and offices. This is the most
  drastic expression to date of the bourgeois character of the Gorbachev reforms.</p>

  <h4>What could have been done</h4>

  <p>The state structure of the Soviet Union has had one unique feature which no
  capitalist country can even remotely boast of. Instead of having an upper and a lower
  house, as is characteristic of the developed bourgeois states, the Soviet state has
  contained both a Soviet of the Union and a Soviet of Nationalities. This bicameral
  structure was stipulated in Articles 109 and 110 of the Soviet Constitution, which said
  that the two chambers "shall have equal rights" and equal numbers of deputies. In the
  Soviet of Nationalities, deputies are elected on the basis of fixed representation for
  all the Union Republics, Autonomous Republics, Autonomous Regions and Autonomous Areas
  in the USSR. While the constitution has undergone many changes, this feature was still
  intact at the time of the 19th Party Conference in June 1988.</p>

  <p>When it became clear that the Armenia-Azerbaijan struggle had national significance
  and was not just a local affair, it was incumbent upon the Gorbachev administration to
  call into session the Soviet of Nationalities. That was the place for the Central
  Committee to bring the national question up for discussion, in the light of the
  contradiction between the decentralizing, divisive character of bourgeois reforms and
  the centralist needs of socialist construction on a nationwide basis.</p>

  <p>Surely this thought must have occurred to many of the local and national leaders of
  the USSR. Instead of that, the Gorbachev administration resorted to the time-honored
  practice of referring the question to commissions of one sort or another. Nothing of
  importance came out of all these small meetings except long harangues by Gorbachev in
  which he either admonished or scolded the local leaderships, never taking any
  responsibility for his own administration and never raising the question from the point
  of view of principle.</p>

  <p>How in the world can you pursue bourgeois economic reforms without stimulating
  national rivalry and egoism? It poses the great danger of splitting the USSR, at this
  late date, into the Asiatic and the European parts. (We leave out for the moment the
  question of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.)</p>

  <p>While it was correct for Gorbachev to uphold the constitutional provisions that
  prevented the Armenian expansionist elements from annexing Nagorno-Karabakh, that alone
  was no solution. A broad discussion of these principled questions could only bear fruit
  if it was brought up in a genuinely representative and broad forum, like the Soviet of
  Nationalities, which was created for just such purposes.</p>

  <p>At an emergency meeting of the Soviet of Nationalities, the whole question of
  anti-Leninist violations of the nationality question in the past could have been
  reviewed and, on the basis of broad discussion, a wholesale rectification campaign
  could have been embarked on to correct violations of the Leninist policy. Corrective
  legislation could follow.</p>

  <p>Instead of this, the disorders in Armenia and Azerbaijan were continually shuffled
  from one commission to another. The hope that this would be brought up at the 19th
  Party Conference was in vain. The Gorbachev rooters were too busy basking in the
  sunlight of flattery from the bourgeois press, which was praising the novelty and
  forward motion of the reforms. The delegations from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and
  the Baltic states were all given short shrift.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev and his colleagues didn't convene the Soviet of Nationalities because they
  feared an uproarious session. But wouldn't that have been better than what has since
  happened? Once a program was developed, it would have had the immense authority of both
  the Party and the Soviet Union. But now, under the new constitution adopted in 1988,
  the Soviet of Nationalities has been cast into oblivion.</p>

  <h4>Problem is not democracy</h4>

  <p>The bourgeoisie claims that the uprisings are brought about because of the
  democratization. But that is a falsehood. The democratization process, if carried out
  in conjunction with a correct Leninist policy on the national question, could only
  strengthen the foundations of the USSR as a multinational state. It is the divisiveness
  of the ever-growing and widening number of regressive bourgeois reforms which is the
  principal cause of the disorders and uprisings, and not the further development of
  socialist democracy.</p>

  <p>Democracy is only a political form. The imperialists are for the democratization
  process in the USSR because they see that the social content going with it is of a very
  nearly bourgeois character. By contrast, they were against the democratization process
  that thrived in the early Leninist period, before the civil war and intervention,
  because it had a working class and socialist content.</p>

  <p>Where is it all leading? Gorbachev and his grouping can scarcely avoid noticing what
  is going on in Yugoslavia. There, nationalist rivalries and the breakup of the
  centralized economy are virtually liquidating the socialist foundations. This is
  absolutely undeniable and the analogy for the USSR is plain for everybody to see.</p>

  <p>Yugoslavia offers the most cogent lesson on where the introduction of bourgeois
  reforms &mdash; the decentralization of industry, joint ventures with the capitalist
  world, and the acquisition of burdensome loans in order to promote the restructuring
  &mdash; is leading. The net result is galloping inflation, a cut in the living
  standards of the working class, unemployment and the renewal of the most venomous and
  ancient national antagonisms, all products of the abandonment of socialist construction
  in favor of bourgeois reforms.</p>

  <p>To paraphrase Marx, the more degenerated socialist country shows to the less
  degenerated the image of its own future.</p>
