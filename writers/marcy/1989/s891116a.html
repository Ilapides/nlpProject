  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: The Pentagon time bomb (Nov. 16, 1989)</title>

<body>
  <h1>The Pentagon time bomb</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Nov. 16, 1989)</h5>

  <p>In times like these a progressive legislator in the U.S. Congress intent on reducing
  Pentagon appropriations should be able to rise and shine. After all, isn't the Cold War
  over? Or at least winding down?</p>

  <p>They say the process of detente with the USSR began with the signing of the IMF
  treaty and that a new spirit of cooperation has replaced confrontation. The U.S. wars
  of intervention in Angola, Namibia, and even in Central America are said to be slowing
  down too. It is claimed that no U.S soldiers are involved, at least overtly, in direct
  military combat on foreign soil.</p>

  <p>All this is calculated to give the impression that a new phase in peaceful
  capitalist development has opened. But this rosy picture deserves a second look.</p>

  <h4>$305-billion military budget</h4>

  <p>Only the other day the U.S. Congress agreed on a stupendous $305-billion military
  program (New York Times, Nov. 3). Yet what might surprise the general public most is
  that the appropriation was whisked through both houses of Congress with scarcely any
  but token opposition. The fact that both houses have been controlled by a majority of
  Democrats for three years hardly seems to make any difference, especially in matters of
  military expenditures.</p>

  <p>True, the research program for Star Wars was cut by about a billion dollars. But
  this is an abysmally small pittance when measured against the $305 billion in general
  military appropriations for the year.</p>

  <p>Even this cut in the Star Wars budget is a sheer deception. The Pentagon's
  negotiators are old hands at this business. They always ask in the most urgent tones
  for far more than they know they will get. And the legislators have the comfort of
  knowing that the Pentagon will really be satisfied &mdash; for the moment, at least
  &mdash; with a somewhat "reduced" appropriation.</p>

  <p>If there's a need to buffalo the public, a new scare story can always be
  manufactured, which the media will eagerly grasp on to. These stories regularly come up
  at military appropriation hearings &mdash; ones like the new sighting of foreign
  submarines close to U.S. shores.</p>

  <p>Can these military expenditures continue endlessly? Is there no end to the greed of
  the military-industrial complex? Perhaps a recent example will serve to illustrate that
  the problem is not a subjective one; that there is an acute contradiction in Pentagon
  economics which they cannot resolve.</p>

  <h4>The accident on the USS Iowa</h4>

  <p>The recent accident on the Navy carrier Iowa, in which some 47 lives were lost,
  exemplifies the real problems involved in Pentagon spending. The Iowa was one of the
  big U.S. Navy warships stationed in the Pacific during World War II. It became famous
  because it survived many hits from Japanese planes and ships.</p>

  <p>After the war it was taken out of service, or "mothballed" in popular terminology.
  What then happens is that it is listed in the Navy's inventory of inactive ships. It
  also remains on the list of government-owned properties. As an asset of the U.S.
  government, the ship has a market evaluation.</p>

  <p>The U.S. government owns many properties of all kinds, worth untold hundreds of
  billions of dollars. A fraction are regularly sold as surplus property. Sometimes
  government property, including real estate, is sold to the favorite customers of the
  current administration by the U.S. Treasury or the Interior Department, adding up to
  hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars in giveaways.</p>

  <p>The assets of the U.S. government include a varied assortment of things &mdash; from
  monuments, museums, canals, bridges, post offices, and unused land to missiles and
  poison gas. Not the least of these assets is the government's arsenal of military
  hardware.</p>

  <p>When a U.S. fighting ship like the Iowa is retired, it remains part of the inventory
  of the U.S. Navy. It has a price tag attached to it like any other property of the U.S.
  This doesn't necessarily mean that the ship is for sale, although the U.S. government
  does do a thriving business in military hardware, both new and used. As it grows older,
  the ship could also be donated to one of Washington's allies in exchange for political
  concessions.</p>

  <p>The price the ship commands is figured not only on the basis of how much the
  government paid out to naval contractors. It also reflects its so-called market
  value.</p>

  <p>When the Iowa was built, its cost was about $100 million in war-time dollars. At the
  height of the war, when the ship was ready for action, its market price might have been
  in the hundreds of millions. But when it was retired at the end of the war, its market
  value sank dramatically. For many years, it would have been worth nothing more than the
  going price for scrap iron &mdash; until President Reagan took it out of mothballs and
  reactivated it in his pursuit of military adventure in the Middle East. It was sent to
  the Mediterranean alongside the New Jersey, which was used to bombard the oppressed
  peoples of Lebanon.</p>

  <p>Then the price of the Iowa soared, not because it was up for sale but because it was
  involved in a military operation which required that it be extensively repaired and
  refurbished. Eventually the question of modernization would have to be taken under
  consideration if its performance were not to become substandard. This would also mean a
  very steep appreciation of its price tag, which in turn would enhance the value of one
  of the assets of the U.S. government.</p>

  <p>When one of the Iowa's gun turrets blew up earlier this year, a question raised by
  investigators, and aired on ABC's 20/20 news program (Nov. 3, 1989), was whether the
  accident, instead of being a deliberate act of sabotage or the result of human error,
  could have been caused by the ship's obsolescence. Should this be the finding, the
  dollar value of this reactivated ship would almost certainly depreciate again.</p>

  <p>However, if the U.S. Navy, as a result of its lobbying, were to get the funds to
  modernize the ship, its market value would rise substantially. The asset side of the
  U.S. government ledger would then appreciate.</p>

  <h4>Military hardware as commodities</h4>

  <p>Whether in action or in mothballs, the Iowa is thus a commodity, and as a commodity
  is part and parcel of the world market of capitalist commodities. (As Marx said in his
  opening sentence to <em>Capital,</em> "The wealth of those societies in which the
  capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as `an immense accumulation of
  commodities.' ") Its exchange value rises and sinks depending on conditions.</p>

  <p>Several months ago, during an airshow in West Germany, one of the most modern
  British fighters exploded in mid-air, causing many deaths and dozens of injuries. These
  military airshows are always significant because if a performance goes exceptionally
  well, the price tag of the plane rises, even though it may not be for sale.</p>

  <p>Recently the B-1B or Stealth bomber was said to have given a successful performance
  after two previous failures. This would enhance the likelihood of bigger U.S.
  congressional appropriations for the aircraft. If modernization is agreed upon, the
  price tag of the aircraft appreciates and this swells the assets side of the U.S.
  ledger of income and outgo. It should be noted that the stock prices of the military
  contractors involved will also rise on the stock exchanges.</p>

  <p>When one looks at the U.S. government's ledger of assets and liabilities, the Navy's
  arsenal is impressive from the viewpoint of its economic viability. According to the
  1988 <em>Encyclopedia Britannica Book of the Year,</em> the U.S. Navy at the end of
  1987 consisted of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>237 principal surface ships</li>

    <li>92 nuclear attack submarines (SSN)</li>

    <li>583,800 personnel</li>

    <li>15 carrier and 3 battleship groups (each carrier having an attack-wing of some 86
    aircraft plus escorting surface vessels and SSN)</li>

    <li>13 modern (post-1955) aircraft carriers (5 nuclear-powered)</li>

    <li>348 F-14A Tomcat interceptors</li>

    <li>319 A-6 Intruder-Prowler strike planes</li>

    <li>222 F/A-18A Hornet strike planes</li>

    <li>70 E-2C electronic warfare/airborne electronic warning planes</li>

    <li>9 nuclear and 27 conventionally powered guided-weapons (GW) cruisers, including 5
    new Ticonderoga-class ships equipped with an Aegis fleet air defense-missile/radar
    system</li>

    <li>37 GW and 31 gun/anti-submarine warfare (ASW) Spruance-class destroyers</li>

    <li>56 GW and 59 gun frigates.</li>
  </ul>What makes this partial inventory of the U.S. armed forces significant to the
  economy is that it is reflected in the gross national product, in currency operations,
  and in the world currency market. The decline of U.S. assets reacts upon its world
  credit rating.

  <p>Thus, it is in the interest of the U.S. capitalist class in general (not only that
  section identified as the military-industrial complex) that the military assets of the
  government be of economic significance. Hence, the need to modernize. The need to
  appreciate the market value of the arsenal as a whole becomes more imperative with each
  new technological stride in the military-industrial complex.</p>

  <p>This is merely a specific instance of the general need of capitalist industry to
  constantly restructure, which is leading not only to violent and destructive capitalist
  competition but ultimately to an economic crisis of even greater proportions than
  earlier ones.</p>

  <h4>The debit side of the ledger</h4>

  <p>In addition, huge appropriations for the military create indebtedness &mdash; and
  that's the debit side of the ledger. To keep the military assets in a constant state of
  appreciation requires modernization, which must be paid for with either taxes or loans.
  As the assets side of the U.S. ledger appreciates, the debit side increases
  proportionately. The growing indebtedness puts a downward pressure on the U.S. dollar
  and tends to depreciate the general state of the capitalist economy.</p>

  <p>This is a contradiction from which there is no exit without an explosion. It
  expresses the fundamental social contradiction in capitalist society between the
  dynamic growth of the productive forces with the advance of modern technology, and the
  static social system based on the private ownership of the means of production and the
  exploitation of labor.</p>
