  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Drug lords and bankers (Sept. 7, 1989)</title>

  <h1>Drug lords and bankers</h1>

  <h2>A deadly partnership</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Sept. 7, 1989)</h5>

  <p>There's a problem the Bush administration has kept under wraps for a considerable
  period, and it's with the big banks.</p>

  <p>Let there be no confusion about it. The Bush grouping, like any other administration
  of the capitalist government, is wholly devoted to the interests of big business and
  the big banks. Not since the days when Franklin Roosevelt excoriated the bankers and
  industrialists as "economic royalists" has there been even the
  <strong>appearance</strong> of a struggle between the government and the vested
  interests.</p>

  <p>Devoted servants that they are, however, the administrators of any capitalist
  government have to secure their own interests when they collide with the interests of
  the ruling class.</p>

  <h4>Banks were behind deregulation</h4>The big banks have been particular favorites
  during the Reagan and Bush administrations, above and beyond the "call of duty." The
  whole deregulation of industry was propelled by the banks. They also initiated the
  industrial and technological restructuring which has caused so much havoc for millions
  of workers.

  <p>Deregulation has meant dissolving any restraints or regulations previously imposed
  on businesses and banks to protect the safety and well-being of the people.</p>

  <p>One industry which got early attention from the big banks was the airlines. Alfred
  Kahn of the Carter administration was responsible for making plans to break an eventual
  strike of the air traffic controllers after the deregulation of the airline industry
  went through. So when the strike finally came in the early years of the Reagan
  administration, they had everything in place to break the PATCO union.</p>

  <p>Since then, we all know what has happened in the airline industry. The workers have
  been taking a beating while the banks supply the scab airlines with plenty of credit so
  they can keep up their war against labor. Today, almost four months into the Eastern
  Airlines strike, Lorenzo and his gang of cutthroats supported by the banks are still
  trying to break the unions.</p>

  <p>The banks, especially Chase Manhattan, have a classic buddy-buddy relationship to
  Lorenzo that parallels the love-feast between the banks and the government. But there
  comes a time when even the most symbiotic relationship becomes strained under the
  impact of new objective conditions. When this happens, their close partnership can be
  torn asunder and the gates opened wide for the intervention of the broad masses of
  people in a struggle for their own class interests.</p>

  <p>Such is the significance of the ever-mounting casualties from the epidemic of drugs.
  The more money is spent, the more the various repressive agencies of the government get
  involved, the more killings there are &mdash; while the real culprits are obscured.</p>

  <p>They are the biggest banks and multinational corporations on a global scale.</p>

  <h4>Criminal money laundering</h4>

  <p>The banks are involved head over heels in the criminal laundering of ever vaster
  sums of money, without which the giant drug dealers could not possibly survive.</p>

  <p>There is a silent, secret but nonetheless deadly partnership between the drug lords
  and the lords of high finance. They need each other. The drug business could not stand
  as a big business without this relationship.</p>

  <p>Consider this: No big business can survive without depositing its funds in the
  banks. Big business is characterized by the chase for lucrative superprofits. Even if
  the money could be hoarded, idle funds bear no interest. For every day, every hour,
  that millions of dollars are stashed away in places other than banks, much interest is
  lost.</p>

  <p>Idle funds are a burden, and not only a financial one. They are the target of raids
  by the government as well as by other elements of the criminal underworld.</p>

  <p>In the banks, the money is safe and secure. Outside of the banks, it is at high
  risk. The risk in holding large sums of currency comes partly because it is the best
  evidence if there's a raid by the government. Money deposited in banks and laundered is
  a shield which no drug dealer could possibly overlook.</p>

  <p>But what's in it for the banks, one may ask?</p>

  <p>superprofits are as much an attraction to the banks as drugs are to drug
  addicts.</p>

  <p>For the big banks, the rollover of huge sums means super-profit because it involves
  little in the way of bookkeeping compared to the accounts of thousands of small
  depositors. That is a great lure, especially if the money is rolled over several times.
  Even the small drug accounts run in the tens of thousands, and in cash no less.</p>

  <p>Time was when the drug business was considered nickel and dime stuff. But that was
  at least two decades ago. It has since grown to an international financial phenomenon
  whose magnitude staggers the imagination. It's in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
  This can't exist let alone grow without the protection of the banks.</p>

  <h4>Cash is the bottom line</h4>

  <p>Of course, banks can and do invest the money elsewhere, from which they draw
  enormous profits. That much everybody understands. But there is still a more potent
  basis for intimate collaboration. The drug dealers have cash. At certain moments cash
  in a bank vault is of supreme significance to the existence of the bank as a viable
  institution.</p>

  <p>In order to prove that a bank is failing, it is necessary to show that it has
  experienced huge losses, either from sudden significant withdrawals, or because it made
  very accommodating loans, or as a result of the failure of one or several ventures in
  which the bank had invested heavily. But arriving at such proof depends upon the
  none-too-rapid processes by which banks are inspected by government officials.</p>

  <p>It's more likely that a crisis occurs when the bank's reserves are inadequate to
  meet the requirements of the Federal Reserve. It is at those moments, when the bank's
  reserves are dwindling, that cash in the vault of a bank is a lifesaver.</p>

  <p>Cash is the bottom line to everything in banking. It should be remembered that for
  every seven dollars in deposits, one dollar has to be kept in legal reserves. That
  means either government bonds or other government-supported securities, plus cash in
  the vault.</p>

  <p>Every bank tries to keep the barest minimum of legal reserves. Having in excess of
  the legal requirement is unprofitable. The legal reserves of a bank do not produce
  interest for the bank.</p>

  <p>The anxiety to maintain the legal reserve requirements becomes critical whenever the
  Federal Reserve suddenly raises these requirements. This may cause a crisis, not only
  for small banks. Big banks like Franklin National and Continental Illinois have faced
  just such a situation. They have had to scramble to meet the legal requirements.</p>

  <p>If this should coincide with a time of widespread withdrawals due to seasonal
  factors in industry, or preholiday withdrawals, bankers become desperate as they face
  the possible abyss: a failure, which most often also brings charges of corruption,
  mismanagement, embezzlement, etc.</p>

  <p>It's enough to drive them into the arms of any drug dealer.</p>

  <h4>Reagan gave banks autonomy</h4>

  <p>The bankers got a completely free hand from the Reagan and Bush administrations,
  which released them from any kind of significant restraints on who they could lend to,
  where the money was kept, and how they related to the Federal Reserve, the government's
  central bank. The big banks today are mostly autonomous. This is the opposite of what
  happened in the early 1930s, when the big banks were strictly controlled in order to
  save the capitalist economy from completely disintegrating after the big collapse of
  the stock market.</p>

  <p>There used to be a division between commercial banks and investment banks, each with
  its own field of operations. Savings banks were restricted from investing in
  speculative enterprises. Commercial banks were restricted from acquiring savings banks.
  But today they are virtually autonomous and free of all restraints.</p>

  <p>The managers and the 12 members of the Federal Reserve Board, including the
  chairman, are all Republicans and are mostly right-wing reactionaries. You rarely hear
  a word about them in the capitalist press, and certainly no information on what they
  are really doing.</p>

  <p>Their operations are secret. Nobody really knows how the central bank functions in
  relation to the multinational financial corporations like Citicorp and others.</p>

  <p>Can it be that the bankers don't know where the drug money is? In point of fact, the
  Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency all
  know where the dollars are at any one time. The tremendous advances in
  telecommunications have made it easier to know where the money is. They may not be able
  to predict how the price of money will rise or fall. And they can't control the ups and
  downs of the capitalist market. But they do know where all the money is.</p>

  <p>Generally the big banks have little to fear from government investigations.
  Convictions are minimal and considered laughable. The government doesn't want to show
  the real source of the drug traffic. They will accuse some underlings, some minor
  figures, but they do not want to point out the real center of it &mdash; the big banks
  and the Federal Reserve system itself.</p>

  <h4>Banks investigated in 1986</h4>

  <p>The Reagan administration and the banks got off easy in 1986. The Treasury
  Department had been investigating the laundering of money by the big banks. It could
  have been an enormous scandal showing a corrupt criminal conspiracy between the banks
  and the drug dealers. But instead it was handled as a low-profile investigation.</p>

  <p>No criminal charges were filed. Nevertheless, some of the biggest banks, including
  Bank of America, the First Boston Corporation, Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover
  Trust, Chemical, Crocker National and Irving Trust all had to pay civil penalties, some
  in millions of dollars, because of money laundering. Bank of America, which was fined
  $4.75 million, had failed to report 17,000 large cash transactions. This was reported
  in the New York Times of Jan. 22, 1986, but then quickly forgotten.</p>

  <p>How could all this be treated in such a matter-of-fact way when in reality it showed
  profound ties between the big banks and the criminal underworld? The answer of course
  is the symbiotic relationship between the banks and the government. A few underlings
  may be convicted, but never the big bankers.</p>

  <p>Consider this. The savings and loan bankruptcies, which involve some $350 billion,
  involved many acts of criminal negligence and corruption. And yet such is the power of
  the banks that they got most of both houses of Congress to push this tremendous
  indebtedness onto the backs of the mass of the people, the working class. The ones who
  will suffer most are the needy, the homeless, the unemployed. This huge debt will eat
  away at housing, health care, nutrition programs, and all other social services.</p>

  <p>The government continues to pretend not to notice that the principal culprit of the
  drug trade is the banks themselves. This problem grows bigger every day. How long can
  the capitalist government keep the lid on this? How long can the Bush administration or
  Congress, the capitalist press and media, maintain silence?</p>

  <p>Not until the source of the drug pestilence is made clear will any real progress be
  made. It won't be made with more cops arresting and beating up young people, or picking
  up petty drug dealers.</p>

  <p>The government claims it is involving all elements of the population in the "war
  against drugs," but two fundamental constituents, the labor movement and the oppressed
  communities, have no authority and more importantly are allocated no funds.</p>

  <p>Now more than ever is an opportunity for the labor movement, for the Black, Latin,
  Asian, Native, lesbian and gay movements, to make a strong intervention, put the
  spotlight on this deadly partnership and let the mass of people have a hand in
  uncovering this most vicious of all conspiracies in order to effect a practical,
  working class solution to the problem.</p>
