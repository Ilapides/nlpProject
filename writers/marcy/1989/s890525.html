  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: The Significance of the Sino-Soviet Summit (May 25,

  <h1>The Significance of the Sino-Soviet Summit</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (May 25, 1989)</h5>May 17 &mdash; The summit conference in Beijing
  between the leaders of the USSR and China is a most welcome development and should get
  the support of the working class, the progressive movement and all the oppressed
  countries everywhere.

  <p>In his televised speech today at the Great Hall of the People, Soviet President and
  General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev regretted the mistakes of the past, including
  "raising ideological disputes and divergences to a level of state confrontation," that
  had led to a rupture in relations between these two great socialist countries. The
  resumption of normal diplomatic relations, trade, commerce, and scientific and cultural
  exchanges between the two will not only benefit the peoples of both countries but
  promises to have far-reaching consequences in international relations.</p>

  <p>No matter how much the imperialists are trying to conceal their disappointment,
  rapprochement among the socialist countries is a direct rebuff to the main element in
  imperialist foreign policy, which has been to exacerbate and envenom the differences in
  the socialist camp to the point of open conflict, if possible.</p>

  <p>A new friendly relationship between the two socialist states will certainly have a
  profound effect in all of Asia. Hopefully, notwithstanding the bourgeois character of
  the economic reforms, it will stimulate a new chapter in the anti-imperialist struggle
  against the U.S., Japan, and the other imperialist countries.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois press continually harps on the 30-year enmity between the two
  countries and the damage this has caused in both. It led the two powers into almost a
  full-scale border war in 1969 and another in 1979, during the Vietnam-Kampuchea crisis.
  The world historic significance of the deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations is an
  area that will bear further searching analysis in years to come in both the USSR and
  China.</p>

  <h4>What was the substance of the dispute?</h4>

  <p>However, at this particular moment, when world attention is so focused on the
  dispute and the resumption of relations, it would be wholly wrong and injurious to the
  interests of the worldwide working class and oppressed people to mention only the
  subjective factors, i.e., the political views of the respective leaders, and overlook
  the objective causes of the dispute. What was the underlying and fundamental basis for
  the various disputes? The issue was, what attitude should the socialist countries take
  toward aggressive, bellicose and expansionist imperialism, which is still on the
  doorstep of China in south Korea and actually on Chinese territory in Taiwan?</p>

  <p>Certainly, the U.S. occupation of south Korea made relations between China and the
  USSR difficult. The constant threats by the U.S. over Quemoy and Matsu islands, the
  containment policy toward China, the blocking of its UN membership for over two decades
  &mdash; these are but a few of the grave problems that agitated the debate over what to
  do about imperialist aggression and capitalist penetration worldwide.</p>

  <p>The origin of the struggle in a formal sense began in the middle 1950s, when the
  Khrushchev regime attempted to impose the policy of so-called peaceful coexistence with
  imperialism as a dogmatic precept in the conduct of its international relations. There
  was the question of whether capitalism could reform itself and become democratized when
  it was exporting counterrevolution all over the Third World, especially in Asia, as it
  still does.</p>

  <p>Certainly, the subjective factor in the worsening of the dispute should not in any
  way be underestimated. But one must recognize where the problem came from, on what
  basis it developed. To keep silent about this is to let the imperialists off the hook
  and give them a free ride to promote their own interpretation of their 40 years of
  counterrevolutionary activity against the Chinese revolution and their long support of
  the Chiang Kissed regime.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, even as they played the "China card" against the USSR, the U.S.
  was constantly raising the nuclear threat with more powerful weapons systems.
  Overflights by U.S. spy planes like the U-2 were a constant reminder of the Pentagon's
  hostile intent. Every effort was made to encircle the USSR with U.S. bases and
  reactionary regimes. The CIA promoted counterrevolution in Iran, Afghanistan, as well
  as in Eastern Europe. It was behind bloody military takeovers in Chile and Indonesia,
  an invasion of Cuba, and numerous interventions in Latin America. It moved into
  Europe's former colonies in the Middle East and Africa, and replaced Japan in the
  Pacific.</p>

  <h4>Relation between summit meeting and economic reforms</h4>

  <p>There is a dialectical relationship between the need of both the Soviet and Chinese
  parties to restore fraternal relations and the bourgeois reform movements in both
  countries.</p>

  <p>Foreign policy is an extension of domestic policy. This is true in war and peace.
  The so-called reform movements in the USSR and China, which have taken on a more
  volatile character at the moment, are bourgeois in their social and political
  content.</p>

  <p>Of course, as in every movement, there are elements who misunderstand their own
  interests and the interests of the workers' state. However, the tone, the main drive of
  both movements, is not merely conservative but is bourgeois in character. This is
  notwithstanding that socialist democracy in and of itself is a wholly progressive idea,
  and never should have been abandoned in the USSR or in China.</p>

  <p>The important thing to note about the summit conference, from the point of view of
  the motivation of the respective leaderships, is that each needed a summit conference
  to consummate the restoration of normal relations. This is because of their mutual need
  to reinforce each other's prestige in order to gain support for their pursuit of the
  capitalist market and bourgeois reforms in general. Gorbachev needs the support of Deng
  Xiaoping and the rest of the Chinese leadership, and Deng needs Gorbachev, in order to
  reinforce a strategic retreat from Leninist politics into the morass of bourgeois
  reformism, under the mask of socialist restructuring or modernization.</p>

  <p>If we are to believe the series of reports in the capitalist press coming out of
  China, Gorbachev has become a popular image there of democracy, while China's economic
  schemes have become popular in the USSR.</p>

  <p>The irony of such a situation seems best described by Karl Marx in his foreword to
  <em>The Poverty of Philosophy.</em> Written in 1847, it was an attack on the German
  petty-bourgeois anarchist philosopher Proudhon. "M. Proudhon has the misfortune of
  being peculiarly misunderstood in Europe. In France he has the right to be a bad
  economist because he is reputed to be a good German philosopher. In Germany he has the
  right to be a bad philosopher because he is reputed to be one of the ablest of French
  economists. Being both Germans and economists at the same time, we desire to protest
  against this double error."</p>

  <h4>Who's for the bourgeois reforms?</h4>

  <p>To listen to the capitalist press sing out its paeans of praise for the economic
  reforms in China, and the political reforms in the USSR, one would think they were
  welcomed with open arms everywhere. But this is a distortion. It is mainly the
  bourgeois elements, the new petty-bourgeois entrepreneurs, the profiteers in the
  private cooperatives and those engaged in trade and commerce who are supportive of the
  bourgeois reforms. Where is the working class? Marx showed that the proletariat is the
  only truly revolutionary class in modern times. Today it is the most numerous class in
  the USSR and the most dynamic in China, growing by the tens of millions. But it has not
  yet spoken. Isn't it strange that the bourgeois press has failed to take notice of this
  remarkable phenomenon?</p>

  <p>Some workers, of course, may be ensnared into supporting the student movement in
  China. But this is a very temporary phenomenon based mostly on lack of understanding
  what this variegated movement is about. There are progressive elements in it, some
  genuinely revolutionary, but its program is set by the sons and daughters of the
  nouveau riche and the capitalist roaders in the Chinese CP leadership.</p>

  <p>At this stage, the imperialist bourgeoisie appear to be happy with the Beijing
  summit conference. In reality, they are deeply hostile to it, but are forced to put up
  a show of approval. One has to remember by contrast what their attitude was during the
  really difficult days of the 1969 fighting on the Siberian border, for instance. The
  New York Times dispatched one of its editors, Harrison Salisbury, to cover the war
  front, as they already called it, and they did everything to envenom the relationship
  and cheer on both sides in the struggle.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie promoted the concept that the split was irreparable, given the
  nature of the communist systems in both China and the USSR. One should read Harrison
  Salisbury's book <em>War Between Russia and China</em> in which he promoted the thesis
  that war was virtually inevitable and the split in the socialist camp was
  irreparable.</p>

  <p>This was also the U.S. view during the struggle involving Vietnam and Kampuchea.
  Deng Xiaoping went to extremes when he came to Washington to elicit military support
  against the USSR from the Carter administration. But the answer of Carter was that
  China should first get deeply involved itself before he would make any commitment.</p>

  <p>This was a Carterite version of what Truman said before the U.S. went into Second
  World War. "Let them both bleed to death," he said, referring to Germany and the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>While there is of course much more to the summit conference, at this stage there
  have been no written communiques or printed speeches. It will require more time and
  experience to analyze it carefully.</p>

  <p>As for the bourgeois economic reforms in both countries, they are bound to be
  short-lived, no matter how much the leaders try to prolong them, or as Gorbachev said,
  make them irreversible. The basic reason is really elementary. It is capitalism with
  which they are experimenting. The growth of inflation and corruption evident in both
  countries is bound to find a response in the broad masses of the workers. At this
  point, the bourgeois elements are trying to capitalize on the discontent of the masses
  and capture some of the workers' support, as in the recent Soviet elections and the
  student movement in China.</p>

  <p>But all this is part of a process of development. We must await the next phase when
  the workers themselves will become the principal actors &mdash; as has already been
  seen in some areas of China, where Mao buttons are reappearing and profiteers are
  experiencing workers' justice.</p>
