  <h1>Behind the struggle over 'The Satanic Verses'</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 16, 1989 )</h5>

  <p>As this is written, the media are reporting that the Iranian Parliament has voted to
  break relations with Britain in retaliation for the latter's withdrawal of its
  diplomatic personnel from Teheran and its instigation of the leading members of the
  European Economic Community to do likewise.</p>

  <p>Considering the very long and brutal history of British colonialism the world over
  and in subjugating many millions of Moslem people, it is difficult to believe that the
  British government did not know when it withdrew its delegation that retaliation would
  follow.</p>

  <p>Was it really so difficult for the Foreign Office, particularly after its long
  dealings in India, to refresh its memory as to the bloody struggles it instigated
  between the Moslems and Hindus? Could they not have known that the withdrawal of
  diplomatic personnel would only give Khomeini and his collaborators another opportunity
  to raise a false issue--at a time when he needs it so badly?</p>

  <p>Surely the British could easily have found other ways than diplomatic pressure to
  raise the issue of Khomeini's threat to the life of author Salman Rushdie.</p>

  <p>The clamor in Britain, all throughout Europe and most particularly in the U.S. was
  loud enough. Nobody in Teheran could mistake it. What need was there to apply
  diplomatic pressure? The least the British government could have done was refrain from
  orchestrating a diplomatic, European-wide response.</p>

  <p>It was only natural, therefore, for the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament to respond
  thus: "The ground has been laid for a vast battle between Islam on the one hand and
  paganism and arrogance on the other." It only remained for the imperialist monopolies
  in the U.S. to subtly and slyly raise the slogan of free speech and freedom of
  thought.</p>

  <p>It should be said in favor of the literary community in the U.S. that it was at
  first hesitant to move in so boldly and without prior consideration of the deeper
  issues. But nonetheless the campaign against the Khomeini regime is in full swing. Thus
  the battle has been joined, so to speak. One side presents it as freedom of thought,
  free speech against tyranny; the other as Islam against paganism.</p>

  <h4>Material interest behind the abstractions</h4>

  <p>All of Marxism teaches, however, that these glittering generalities, these fine
  abstractions, are merely a cover for deeper issues. Marxism teaches the working class
  and the oppressed to go beyond the slogans and make every effort to uncover the
  materialist basis for every serious struggle.</p>

  <p>It is the struggle of classes, the struggle between oppressor and oppressed over the
  material means of life, which is the springboard of social development. Politics is
  merely the concentrated expression of the underlying economic issues.</p>

  <p>We can get nowhere by regurgitating the stale rhetoric bequeathed to the working
  class and the oppressed by the old ruling classes and by outdated, pernicious and false
  leadership.</p>

  <p>Are we to forget what the Iranian Revolution was all about? And the consequences
  that flow from it? Are we to forget that the struggle in this last quarter of a century
  has been a most brutal and cruel one between oppressors and oppressed, of the
  super-rich imperialist countries (true, only a handful of them) against a vast ocean of
  oppressed?</p>

  <p>Are we to forget that the old colonial empires, after becoming disintegrated and
  dissolved, have refortified and strengthened themselves on the basis of economic
  penetration and scientific and technological restructuring of their military and
  industrial prowess?</p>

  <h4>Iranian Revolution still unfulfilled</h4>

  <p>It is ten years since the Iranian Revolution. So much has happened, so much blood
  has been spilled. The imperialists have been ousted from a strategic area in the Middle
  East. But it hasn't impoverished them a bit. Indeed, they have grown fatter by
  supplying weapons of destruction and continuing to extract more oil, the economic
  life-blood of the oppressed people.</p>

  <p>None of this could of course excuse the rash, thoroughly adventurist and indeed
  opportunist maneuver by the Ayatollah to once again seize the initiative, to galvanize
  the masses, now tired from the destructive, fruitless and fratricidal war against Iraq,
  and urge them on to a new campaign which can provide at best only short-lived
  ideological resuscitation as a substitute for the economic rehabilitation of the
  war-torn country.</p>

  <p>It remained for none other than former president Jimmy Carter to try to come to the
  rescue of the European imperialist fraternity, counseling caution in the light of a
  possibly more dangerous development for the "democracies."</p>

  <p>In a short op-ed piece in the March 5 New York Times, Carter first applauded freedom
  of speech and then abjured the death threat from Khomeini. But then he went on to say,
  "We have tended to promote him and his book with little acknowledgment that this is a
  direct insult to those millions of Moslems whose sacred beliefs have been violated. ...
  Western leaders should make it clear that in protecting Rushdie's life and civil rights
  there is no endorsement of an insult to the sacred beliefs of our Moslem friends.
  ...</p>

  <p>"Iranian and other fundamentalists are not the only Moslems involved. There are
  millions of others who are waiting for a thoughtful and constructive response to their
  concerns. Tactful public statements and private discussions," he suggests, "could still
  defuse this explosive situation."</p>

  <p>And who writes all this? The former friend and champion of no less than the shah!
  Should all this be forgotten? Carter never worried about the sensitivities of the
  Moslems who were being butchered by the shah. But now he, along with others, are
  suddenly concerned about the millions of Moslems whose views may be hurt by the
  book.</p>

  <h4>Two faces of U.S. imperialism</h4>

  <p>Carter speaks in this instance for the Bush administration, who prefer to rally
  bourgeois public opinion and direct it into anti-Khomeini channels, but also wish to
  appear as friends of the Moslem fundamentalists in the interest of a deal which would
  serve imperialism. All their concerns for freedom of speech would quickly be thrown
  overboard if they could establish a modus vivendi with rightwing ecclesiastical
  reaction, a deal that would fortify imperialism's position in the Middle East.</p>

  <p>The Rushdie book, notwithstanding all the clamor for free speech, is small change
  that can cynically be traded in for a larger prize: a peaceful settlement in the Middle
  East which could guarantee imperialist oil booty to U.S., British, French, German and
  Japanese imperialism. Such a cause would be oh-so worthy, especially if it undid the
  extremist elements in Iran and got the so-called pragmatists solidly under the thumb of
  the good old imperialist oil monopolies.</p>

  <p>The problem with the shah in his years of struggle against the revolutionary
  movement, and particularly the working class vanguard element, was that he overlooked
  the political value of the mullahs and the ecclesiastical authorities in general. The
  latter wanted no more than to share, if only in some small measure, the oil booty that
  the imperialists allotted to the crown. If only the shah had realized that small
  financial and economic concessions to them would have guaranteed their support! But
  this afterthought occurred to him when he was virtually breathing his last.</p>

  <h4>Who is Salman Rushdie?</h4>

  <p>Salman Rushdie is a Bombay-born author from a Moslem family. His parents are
  prosperous, which enabled them to send him to Britain for his education. He attended
  Rugby and King's College, Cambridge. Within a brief time he had attained considerable
  fame as an author. Among his novels are <em>Grimus, Shame</em> and <em>Midnight's
  Children.</em> The latter won considerable praise and got the Booker McConnell prize
  for fiction in 1981. Written in fantasy form, it deals with the partition of the Indian
  subcontinent into India and Pakistan.</p>

  <p>Salman Rushdie is a literary intellectual of the moderate left. He has vigorously
  supported the struggle of Black and Asian immigrants in Britain and severely castigated
  the British government for its discriminatory and repressive position.</p>

  <p>In a television appearance some time ago in Britain (recently replayed in New York
  over the CUNY cable station) he attacked the government most vigorously, charging that
  while the British empire may have been dissolved abroad, it nevertheless has been
  reconstituted within Britain itself. He pointed out that if one examines the plight of
  Asians, Africans and other immigrants, one can see a clear pattern of colonialism, a
  replica in Britain of what colonialism was abroad.</p>

  <p>Rushdie also wrote a briefer piece attacking U.S. aggression in Central America and
  defending the Nicaraguan revolution. It is very plain that, as far as anyone can make
  out on this side of the Atlantic, he is a literary intellectual clearly in the camp of
  the progressive movement.</p>

  <p>The furor over his latest novel, <em>The Satanic Verses,</em> has to be put in
  proper perspective in order to understand what lies beneath the struggle. Why has it
  caused such an extraordinary reaction in some of the Moslem nations? And what is the
  attitude of the imperialist governments to these events?</p>

  <p>Opposition to the book first developed in India, then in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
  It was belatedly picked up in Teheran, where it was raised to an altogether explosive
  level. There have been demonstrations in several Nigerian cities and, as of this
  writing, one of the leaders of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
  Palestine-General Command, Ahmed Jabril, has joined Khomeini in calling for the killing
  of Rushdie.</p>

  <h4>The issue of free speech</h4>

  <p>In the U.S., the literary community was slow in reacting to Khomeini's call. But
  after some hesitation it has gotten into full swing. On March 6, a full-page ad in the
  New York Times signed by many members of the Writers Guild of America roundly condemned
  the Iranian government for inciting the murder of Rushdie. This group drapes itself in
  the flag of "the U.S. Constitution, the values of our history, the American spirit,"
  and condemns the whims and oppression of a dictator.</p>

  <p>Although from a subjective point of view they have acted in defense of free thought
  and free speech, in reality they are carrying the torch for the imperialist monopolies,
  and most particularly the oil monopolies, which are deep in the background. Needless to
  say, all the imperialist governments in Europe have condemned the Iranian regime,
  taking the opportunity to profess freedom of speech.</p>

  <p>Likewise, it's not surprising that the Rushdie book should have become an issue with
  the Moslem fundamentalists. It has become a handy way for them to conduct a struggle
  against progressive and truly democratic forces which are just emerging in some of the
  Moslem countries.</p>

  <h4>Clerical reaction not anti-imperialist</h4>

  <p>It should be remembered that these rightwing fundamentalists were always
  pro-imperialist and a prop for imperialist domination. The Iranian religious right was
  not "revolutionary" in the early 1950s. It was distinctly absent from the fateful
  struggle of the Mossadegh government against imperialism. The religious right never
  raised its head anywhere in the anti-imperialist opposition.</p>

  <p>At the other end of the Moslem world, in Indonesia, where certainly one of the
  greatest bloodbaths of modern times led to the destruction of the revolutionary
  movement at the hands of the CIA and its military culprits, there were no declamations
  of revolutionary struggle from the conservative fundamentalist Moslem clergy. They were
  too busy dipping their hands in the blood of the workers and peasants. Where the Moslem
  fundamentalists were heard and seen was in the mass butchery of communists and
  progressives. That is where their "revolution" was most manifest, as it has been
  everywhere else.</p>

  <p>It is only with the Iranian Revolution, which was usurped by the Khomeini forces,
  that they have suddenly come to the fore, not by accident but by design. They along
  with the bourgeoisie are reaping the fruits of the revolution while dealing death and
  destruction to the masses.</p>

  <h4>Imperialists looking for a deal</h4>

  <p>The imperialist governments are not concerned at all with defending free speech or
  the struggle for secularism in the oppressed countries if the religious right can be of
  greater use to them in garnering super profits. Making a deal with the extremists, if
  they can, is far more suitable and in line with their historical position than to push
  forward so-called democratic or pragmatic forces and use them as the vehicle for the
  secularization of political life in the Moslem countries.</p>

  <p>What need was there for a Rushdie when they had a Zia? And even if Benazir Bhutto
  now nominally holds the reins of authority in Pakistan, it is much safer to rely on the
  reactionary clergy, the landed aristocracy and the military which comes from them.</p>

  <p>Defending Rushdie against the religious right is an accidental matter. It does not
  fit the historical role of imperialism. But it is a necessary and momentary sojourn and
  does not negate its alliance with clerical obscurantism fortified by brutal military
  suppression. Only when these weapons become exhausted does imperialism try to put its
  left leg forward, as it is doing a bit in the Philippines and as it may do tomorrow in
  Korea and other oppressed countries when the situation ripens.</p>

  <p>It doesn't appear to be in the proper interests of imperialist domination in the
  epoch of its decay and disintegration to firmly ally itself with progressive forces
  against right-wing reaction because that would merely open the door to the progressive
  and revolutionary elements once the struggle takes on a momentous character.</p>

  <p>One should not take too seriously the projection of a wide, deep split between the
  forces of Islamic reaction and the so-called liberalizing democratic values of Western
  imperialism. These are two false fronts. The duty of revolutionary Marxists is to go
  beyond the surface manifestation, beyond the open political programs of the imperialist
  countries with their deceptive slogans and false posturing, and come down to the real
  issues.</p>

  <h4>All in defense of super-profits</h4>

  <p>The imperialists are concerned with naked exploitation, with super-profits. The rest
  is mere cover for this and an attempt to blind the eyes of the masses of people both in
  the exploited and exploiting countries. The militancy of Western democracy, with its
  free speech approach, should not be taken for good coin. It is the passing fancy of the
  imperialist bourgeoisie. They will put many able artists, writers, scientists, etc., in
  the forefront, people who are well-meaning and concerned with freedom of speech and
  indeed willing to sacrifice much. But they are nevertheless on the chariot of the
  imperialist colossus and have been turned into water boys and girls for the
  Pentagon.</p>

  <p>As for the militancy of the religious right, it is a fraud. They have never carried
  out an independent struggle against imperialism and have never raised their voice for
  the workers and peasants. They are not opposed to the multinational exploitation of the
  resources, they only want a share, provided proper respect is shown for them.</p>

  <p>The British imperialists long ago learned to talk the language of the native
  bourgeoisie. The antagonism between them is of a secondary and tertiary character. They
  are the intermediaries between the exploiters and the masses of people. The problem is
  to understand all the intricate relations between the imperialists and the
  post-colonial elements--the landlords, bankers--and their merciless exploitation and
  oppression of the masses.</p>

  <p>The great need of the day is to understand that this takes place in the period of a
  global struggle between the imperialists and all of the oppressed masses, the world
  proletariat as a whole and its allies in the socialist countries.</p>

  <h4>Rushdie and religion</h4>

  <p>Where does the Rushdie book fit into this world struggle? <em>The Satanic
  Verses</em> is a novel which, by all accounts of those who both praise the novel and
  those who are violently opposed to it, deals with the religion of the Moslem people in
  an insensitive or derogatory manner.</p>

  <p>It is for the literary people to debate this. We for our part may agree that it is
  possibly insensitive or offensive. But it is also the right of the author to promote an
  anti-religious theme. But here, as in everything else, Marxists must understand the
  nature of the epoch in which such literature appears and what effect it may have on the
  course of the worldwide progressive struggle.</p>

  <p>Looking at the book from the viewpoint of the struggle against imperialism and the
  task of the masses in the oppressed countries, which classes or groups of classes can
  such a book serve under the present circumstances?</p>

  <p>By this time virtually all political tendencies have had their say and their
  interpretation, including the Vatican and the chief rabbi of Jerusalem. Only one has
  come to our attention that attempts to raise the issue in terms of the historical
  situation of the Moslem people. An op-ed piece in the <em>New York Times</em> of Feb.
  23 by S. Nomanul Haq, described as a tutor in the history of science at Harvard
  University, gently takes Rushdie to task for his novel and for the insensitive way in
  which he deals with the religious question.</p>

  <p>"The Muslim nations," said Professor Haq, "have not gone through the turmoils of the
  Enlightenment [European Enlightenment--SM] and they have seen no scientific revolution;
  their sensibilities are different."</p>

  <p>Professor Haq has opened the door to what is really the great issue, the issue of
  the historic significance of the European Enlightenment period and the meaning of the
  scientific revolution as it has affected world social and political development.</p>

  <h4>The Enlightenment in Europe</h4>

  <p>The Enlightenment period in European history was led by such great figures in
  literature as Voltaire, Molière and Racine in France, Cervantes in Spain, and Boccaccio
  in Italy. They broke down the ideological armor of the feudal lords and the
  ecclesiastical aristocracy. They cleared away the stalactites and stalagmites which
  were the legacy of Catholicism in the service of feudal exploitation of the peasants
  and of the early burghers.</p>

  <p>The Enlightenment paved the way for capitalist development by making bourgeois
  democracy possible. It gave the green light to secularism and to so-called free
  thought. It led finally to the great French Revolution which cut down feudalism root
  and branch.</p>

  <p>These men of the Enlightenment had no reverence for religion at all. Of course, the
  free thought they championed turned out to be freedom for the bourgeoisie to exploit
  the working class, just as the feudal lords tried to rob and restrict the bourgeoisie.
  It was not, however, just a change of one oppressor for another. It was also a step in
  the direction of the ultimate emancipation of the proletariat from the domination of
  the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>True, it hasn't all been accomplished. There have been many great revolutionary and
  brilliant battles fought by the proletariat to gain its own independence, and it has
  been forced into many retreats. Nevertheless, the struggle still goes on and the days
  of the bourgeoisie are numbered.</p>

  <p>What relevance then has the European Enlightenment period to the contemporary
  situation of the Moslem world? Notwithstanding the very rich scientific developments
  and achievements in northern Africa, to which Europe is still indebted, this region has
  not yet had the benefits of an Enlightenment period of the historical dimensions of
  Europe. And that is because capitalist development there had tardy beginnings and later
  was stunted by the brutal intervention of European capitalist imperialism.</p>

  <p>Rushdie's novel has significance as an attempt to do in respect to Moslem
  fundamentalism on the edge of the 21st century what Rabelais, Molière, Voltaire or
  Boccaccio were doing in the European period--to mercilessly expose and ridicule the
  feudal institutions that stood in the way of democratic development. But alas, to use
  the ideology and methods of the European Enlighteners of several centuries ago is
  totally inappropriate in this period.</p>

  <p>To ridicule the priesthood on the basis of a bourgeois rationalist approach was
  appropriate and progressive in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Enlightenment did it
  with wit, humor and brilliance, helping to brush aside the cobwebs of superstition in
  order to liberate science and pave the way for the more democratic order of the
  bourgeoisie, which permitted ideological conflict in order to raise itself to the
  stature of the ruling class.</p>

  <h4>Masses need clear language</h4>

  <p>But Rushdie lives in an altogether different historical context. He lives in a
  period when the hold of the ecclesiastical institutions of the old world can be
  loosened only by modern, proletarian and thoroughly anti-imperialist methodology and
  language. Resorting to literary sleight-of-hand can hurt the sensibilities of the
  masses without in the least helping to free them from political, let alone economic,
  bondage to the new landlords and industrialists.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the surrealist approach of Rushdie becomes a tool in the hands of
  reaction. His use of a dreamlike world and fantasy is subject to so many different
  interpretations that it cannot possibly be a tool in the hands of the oppressed masses.
  They need a clear and unambiguous message.</p>

  <p>The European Enlightenment figures were not addressing themselves to the peasant
  masses but to the newly educated and rising bourgeoisie who could understand them,
  relish their thinking and be titillated by their scorn and ridicule aimed at the
  ancient feudal institutions.</p>

  <p>There is also, of course, a rich heritage for the working class in the struggles of
  peasant leaders like John Ball in Britain (see <em>The Dream of John Ball</em> by
  William Morris) and Thomas Munzer and Jan Hus in the peasant wars in Germany, as well
  as the rise of virtually communist religious sects in eastern Europe throughout that
  early period.</p>

  <p>In the struggle against imperialism, nothing is more necessary than a clear
  direction that specifically and categorically clarifies not only one's position to
  imperialism but also the relationship of the classes and the political programs at
  home. Because Rushdie's novel is so vague and susceptible to different interpretations,
  what is offensive from the point of view of religion becomes the predominant factor.
  The attack against the Moslem right is scarcely audible, visible or even
  understandable. Thus it cannot serve as an instrument to free the masses from either
  clerical obscurantism or imperialist bondage.</p>

  <p>Whereas his earlier novel, <em>Midnight's Children,</em> had a clear message insofar
  as it portrayed the hand of British imperialism in the division of Pakistan and India,
  here the message is blurred. It thus becomes an easy tool in the hands of reaction
  rather than a means of struggle in the hands of the masses.</p>

  <p>It is necessary at all costs to avoid becoming unwitting allies of imperialist
  ambitions on the basis of innocuous, abstract slogans. The more abstract the slogan,
  the more easily it lends itself to ruling class interests. At the same time, it is
  crucial to show the greatest amount of internationalist solidarity with the oppressed
  people and to strengthen links with the most progressive and the most devoted to the
  struggle for independence from imperialism and from domestic political reaction.</p>

  <p>The great task at hand today is to increase and widen the literature for the masses
  that speaks of imperialist exploitation and of the double dealing and collusion between
  the landlords and bourgeoisie with the imperialists. This is not what the novel does.
  At most, it is of esoteric value to a small group in the democratic movement.</p>

  <p>What would be far more appropriate and in the interest of the masses is to have
  novels of the type written by Maxim Gorky, who according to Lenin was not as consistent
  as he should have been but who wrote about the peasants in <em>Mother</em> and in many
  other works which awakened the revolutionary movement and inspired the young generation
  to struggle. This is what is needed, and it will surely develop.</p>
