  <h1>The new crisis in China</h1>

  <h2>(part 1)</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (May 4, 1989)</h5>

  <p>The large student demonstrations in China in recent weeks, particularly at Beijing
  University, are a portent of social and political crisis. Demonstrations of such
  magnitude can only signify a deepening of the contradictions in the Chinese economy
  today.</p>

  <p>The Chinese leadership, while still fundamentally adhering to socialist centralized
  planning, has unloosed a blizzard of capitalist market mechanisms; has dismantled the
  communes, the revolutionary basis of Chinese agriculture; and has given vent to and
  stimulated lust for private gain and profit on a scale which amazes even the
  imperialist bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Galloping inflation is the inevitable concomitant of the introduction of bourgeois
  mechanisms in distribution and the sale of consumption items at a time when there are
  still official, government-"regulated" prices. This type of regulation, when
  accompanied by the stimulation of the capitalist market, only brings to the fore once
  more (as has happened so many times in the bourgeois economies) the growing specter of
  the black market and its rivalry with the official market.</p>

  <h4>1976 demonstration at Tienanmen</h4>

  <p>Significant as these student demonstrations are, they should not at this time be put
  on the same level as the demonstrations at Tienanmen Square in the spring of 1976,
  which were supposedly to honor Chou En lai, the Communist leader who had died in
  January of that year. However, it's true that, then and now, these events act as
  springboards for the pro-capitalist reforms, which have put China in danger of sinking
  to the level of a dependent bourgeois economy.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois press here are trying to connect the present student demonstrations
  with the genuinely revolutionary struggles of May 4, 1919, which constituted the
  starting point for one of the greatest social and political transformations in modern
  times. Such an effort is altogether spurious.</p>

  <h4>Demonstration of May 4, 1919, a world apart</h4>

  <p>The May 4th demonstrations were thoroughly anti-imperialist in character. They came
  in the wake of a momentous, revolutionary revival of the working class and
  anti-imperialist movement on a scale never before seen, which brought with it the
  proletarian revolution in Russia. The reverberations of that event could be felt all
  over the world, not least in the great cities of Shanghai, Peking, Canton and
  others.</p>

  <p>The May 4th student movement was the embryo from which sprang the further
  development of the cadres of the Chinese Revolution, who later formed the Communist
  Party of China and the Peoples Liberation Army.</p>

  <p>There is an effort by the bourgeois press here to lump all these different
  demonstrations together. They try to mix oil with water and obscure the difference
  between the demands of the bourgeoisie, those who are for the capitalist road, and
  those who fought during the years of the revolution for socialism and the struggle
  against imperialism.</p>

  <p>The glorious revolutionary tradition of May 4, 1919, and its significance for the
  victory of the Chinese Revolution over the Chiang Kai-shek/imperialist forces, has
  nothing in common with the current Beijing demonstrations. But these latter do have
  striking similarities to the April 1976 demonstrations, which were in reality a show of
  support for the bourgeois forces arrayed against the revolutionary leadership allied
  with Mao Zedong.</p>

  <p>At the time, we wrote (Workers World, April 9, 1976): "This is the first time that
  the right-wing forces in China have more or less come out into the open ... .</p>

  <p>"The demonstration this week, ostensibly held to honor the memory of Chou En lai,
  could virtually be called a support demonstration for the rightists and a bourgeois
  threat to the regime."</p>

  <p>During that crisis, we asked why "the Party leadership brought back into prominent
  positions of power and authority figures like Deng Xiaoping, who was made Senior Deputy
  Prime Minister, Deputy Chairman of the Party, and Acting Chief of Staff of the Army."
  We asked why the rehabilitation of "a figure who had been cast down during the Cultural
  Revolution ... was carried out without any public explanation or discussion!"</p>

  <h4>Forces behind Deng's return</h4>

  <p>Viewing these events in the perspective of 13 years later, it is still difficult to
  understand how the Deng forces, after having been purged during the Cultural
  Revolution, were suddenly brought back into the Party leadership. Was it really done
  with the blessings of Mao himself? Was Mao really in charge at the time, or was his
  name merely being utilized by rightist forces within his own entourage?</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that after Deng consolidated his forces on the basis of
  bourgeois, pro-capitalist reform, he ousted the revolutionary elements in the
  leadership and did, as the Maoists had always predicted, put China on the road to
  capitalism.</p>

  <p>For many years, the Mao forces had warned of the danger of the capitalist roaders
  seizing power in China. The question today is how far the capitalist roaders still want
  to go and in which direction. Can they retain the socialist ownership of the means of
  production and the modicum of centralized socialist planning after having unleashed
  capitalist market forces and opened China to the imperialists? This is really the basic
  problem.</p>

  <p>Now that they have abandoned the revolutionary socialist program, and embraced a
  pro-capitalist and conciliatory position toward imperialism, particularly the U.S., the
  issue is virtually posed on a razor's edge: which direction will China take? We know
  what the entire imperialist camp is rooting for.</p>

  <h4>Workers moving in opposite direction</h4>

  <p>The fortunate part about these student demonstrations is that they have, at least as
  of now, been unable to attract even the most minimal attention of the new, broad
  working class that now embraces many tens of millions. On the contrary, signs have been
  accumulating which show that the more advanced elements have been moving in an
  altogether opposite direction. Recent articles in the New York Times (April 6) and
  Christian Science Monitor (April 11) tell of spontaneous resistance by workers and poor
  farmers to the market-oriented reforms (see Workers World of April 27).</p>

  <p>As of now, the Chinese leadership may be said to be at the border separating
  socialism from capitalism, while the social and economic problems are assuming menacing
  proportions. Deng's pragmatism, which seemed so alluring in the first years of the
  takeover by the pro-bourgeois reform elements, has now shown its seamy, ugly side.</p>

  <p>The vast entrepreneurial capital that was to flow into China to enrich the country
  has thus far enriched only the privileged few and has meant little economic improvement
  for the mass of the urban working class. So far as the peasants are concerned, they are
  still at the mercy of the weather, not much different than in pre-revolutionary times,
  notwithstanding the availability of productive new technology and the growth of the
  capitalist market for farming products.</p>

  <p>No doubt some have progressed as a result of the dismantling of the communes, but
  the larger number have gained nothing from the reforms. In the event of one of those
  frequent natural disasters, such as a crop failure, or the reverberations of a big
  downturn in the capitalist world, the government would find it immeasurably more
  difficult to help the masses, who are now split up into millions of individual farms,
  as compared to the period of the communes.</p>

  <h4>First Gorbachev, then the bankers</h4>

  <p>The student demonstrations take place in the shadow of two significant upcoming
  events to be held in China. The first is the visit of General Secretary Mikhail
  Gorbachev, which has been described as a summit meeting. The purpose of it is to cement
  a significant improvement in state-to-state relations, if not a new socialist
  relationship. Either way, there is mutual benefit for both China and the USSR in the
  pursuit of such a goal.</p>

  <p>The significance of the student demonstrations will not be lost on the USSR
  leadership. It remains to be seen how they view them. Ten years ago, the Soviet leaders
  would have said, if they could, "We told you so!" At that time the incumbent Soviet
  leadership was criticizing Deng Xiaoping's domestic policy as steering a course toward
  the right and of being pro-imperialist in foreign relations.</p>

  <p>The other event is the 22nd annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank, to be held
  in Beijing in the beginning of May. This entity is a creation of the imperialist banks;
  its leading proponents are the U.S., Japan, Britain, France and Holland.</p>

  <p>On the agenda of the bank is a proposal to finance ten projects in China, estimated
  by the Wall Street Journal (April 25) to cost one billion dollars. The International
  Monetary Fund some years ago decided to stage just such an annual meeting in Belgrade,
  Yugoslavia. On its agenda at the time were several projects to be financed by the bank.
  It is hard to avoid relating Yugoslavia's economic condition today and its virtual
  bondage to the imperialist financiers to what the bankers now have in mind for
  China.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, the State Department will be watching the conference with
  Gorbachev. On the other hand, the Treasury Department will be relating the significance
  of the Gorbachev meeting to the propriety of advancing funds for economic
  development.</p>

  <p>The question remains the same one that Lenin posed when, for temporary, strategic
  purposes, he initiated the New Economic Policy: "Who will conquer whom?"</p>
