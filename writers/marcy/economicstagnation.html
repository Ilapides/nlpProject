  <h1>Capitalist economic stagnation and the revolutionary perspective
  <small>[1975]</small></h1>

  <h3>I. The real nature of the current crisis</h3>

  <p>NEW YORK, August 1 &mdash; Beneath the official optimism exuded by the Ford
  administration, there is also a deep-seated and profound pessimism that recent
  indications of an upturn in the economy are of a purely ephemeral character and that
  the country and the capitalist world in general face a long and protracted period of
  economic stagnation, fraught with violent political convulsions and fateful class
  conflicts.</p>

  <p>The very social system which sustains the possessing classes may once again, as in
  the thirties, be at stake &mdash; indeed, it already is in many parts of the capitalist
  world, especially in Southern Europe and most of all in Portugal, Spain, Greece, and
  Italy.</p>

  <p>Even the richest capitalist countries, such as West Germany and France, are
  desperately trying to find ways and means of banding together in some way to ward off
  the deepening crisis. Japan, too, formerly the showplace of capitalist prosperity in
  Asia, is in its own way once again trying to ally itself more securely with the U.S. as
  one way of mitigating the ravaging effects of the economic crisis which has engulfed
  her.</p>

  <p>This does not at all impede the U.S. monopolies from continuing to undercut Japan by
  commercial, economic, and monetary measures. The havoc Nixon brought to the Japanese
  economy in 1971 with the devaluation of the dollar and the ensuing trade offensive
  against her has by no means been overcome, even though 3 years have passed since that
  blow was delivered!</p>

  <p>Each capitalist country is seeking new ground and new allies to save itself from the
  disastrous effects of the world capitalist crisis. But at the same time they are all
  pursuing anew the worn-out reactionary schemes of the thirties, with exhortations for
  so-called "national self-sufficiency" and cries of economic protectionism, all of which
  brought on the virulent nationalist and jingoist propaganda of that day. The U.S. is
  today the primary leader of this trend.</p>

  <p>As in the thirties, "Buy German," "Buy French," "Buy Italian," "Buy Japanese," "Buy
  U.S.," are being pushed with ever greater vigor. Yet all vigorously affirm that the
  world is economically interdependent and needs a new peaceful world order for mutual
  salvation &mdash; provided each capitalist power gets its "just" share of world
  markets, of the robbery of the poor and undeveloped parts of the world. And all
  entertain the deepest hostility to the economic successes of the socialist countries
  and more than ever see them as the greatest threat to their existence.</p>

  <p><strong>Decline &mdash; and 'recovery' but not for the workers</strong></p>

  <p>But to return. Let us not be accused of saying there will not be an upturn in the
  capitalist economy. There already may be some signs of it at the present time, even
  amidst the frightful rise in unemployment and the spectre of yet another spiral of
  galloping inflation.</p>

  <p>The government's index of leading indicators of the economy (released July 29, 1975)
  is said to show a significant rise for the fourth consecutive month. So claims the
  Commerce Department.</p>

  <p>This index is supposed to foretell economic trends. Assuming it to be accurate, it
  is still worthy of notice that the one leading indicator that is usually regarded as a
  bellwether for the economy &mdash; that is, contracts and orders for plants and
  equipment registered a decline!</p>

  <p>However, contesting the government's ever increasing flow of inspired and
  tendentious press releases and surveys demonstrating "that the recession is bottoming
  out" is a fruitless task and leads us nowhere.</p>

  <p>Marxists view the nature of each capitalist crisis as already containing the seeds
  of its own destruction &mdash; recovery. In Marxist economics, the crisis is invariably
  the starting point of a new cycle of capitalist development. According to Marx, the
  capitalist cycle of development goes successively through the phases of crisis,
  depression, recovery, and capitalist boom.</p>

  <p>Thereafter, of course, a new crisis inevitably starts all over again, the last
  generally being more devastating and destructive than the prior one &mdash; always
  taking in its train an enormous toll in human as well as material resources.</p>

  <p>The problem today, however, is not whether there will be an eventual recovery. The
  problem now is how to estimate its character and duration along with the entire current
  capitalist cycle. To a worker, recovery means recovering his or her job. It means the
  end of unemployment and an improvement in the conditions of his or her life. Even
  Meany, in answer to a reporter's question as to "when the recession will be over,"
  answered, "When everybody goes back to work."</p>

  <p>That is not the way the capitalists see it.</p>

  <p><strong>Cure by speed-up!</strong></p>

  <p>The capitalist class views the matter in an altogether different light. Layoffs,
  cutbacks, "rationalization of industry," or increased productivity (speedup), and the
  introduction of labor-saving devices &mdash; that's their cure for the economic crisis.
  They have been acting upon it feverishly and with a vengeance. This can be seen not
  only in the staggering number of unemployed, but also in the steep rise in productivity
  for the second quarter of this year (according to Labor Department statistics released
  late in July). What it means is that output per worker rose in that period after a lag
  of almost 2 years. It indicates not only that labor-saving devices have been
  introduced, but that speedup in the plants has vastly increased. It signifies a sharp
  intensification of labor and an increase in the rate of exploitation.</p>

  <p>However, the question persists &mdash; when will everybody go back to work?</p>

  <p>As though to half-heartedly answer this question, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>
  of July 31 said, "If you've hung on to your job thus far, you will probably make it
  through the rest of the recession without being laid off. But if you are among the
  thousands [Thousands? &mdash; Is it not millions! -SM] already furloughed, you may have
  to wait longer." Had this organ of high finance and industry been really frank, it
  might have added, "much, much longer! And if you have hung on to your job the
  probability is for more and more layoffs!"</p>

  <p>That, indeed, is a far more sobering forecast of the course of the economic crisis.
  It is once again, as in the thirties, idle workers, idle plants, and idle funds stacked
  high in the vaults of the giant banks.</p>

  <p>A favorite bourgeois solution to get the recovery going is to mount a campaign
  &mdash; not to get unemployed workers back to the idle plants and start to operate them
  &mdash; but to once again start the tried and utterly bankrupt process of getting the
  government to lower interest rates for big business which in turn will lure the
  industrial capitalist to borrow money on low-cost terms and in that way start the
  capitalist cycle functioning once more. It's the old "trickle down theory." First they
  get the government to give away money to the big industrial capitalists, either in the
  form of large tax rebates or guaranteed low interest-rate loans, to start functioning
  once more. Eventually they will rehire more and more workers (but not all) and in that
  way some benefits will "trickle down" to the mass of the people.</p>

  <p>The class character of these schemes should be obvious to any one but they persist
  through every capitalist crisis.</p>

  <p>A working class solution is to <strong>first</strong> get all the workers back to
  work and also guarantee an income to all who cannot go back to work (regardless of what
  is involved in the fortunes of the capitalist class so far as profits go). Of course,
  that is not a solution which capitalist politicians and social-democratic reformers
  will easily accept except under the most severe pressure and threats of revolutionary
  struggle.</p>

  <p><strong>The material basis of bourgeois pessimism</strong></p>

  <p>Of course, for the plants and the workers to be <strong>totally</strong> idle has
  its drawbacks for the capitalists as well. Without exploitation of the workers, without
  appropriating the unpaid labor of the workers over and above that which is needed for
  them to barely sustain themselves &mdash; in other words, without the extraction of
  surplus labor from the workers, there is no profit in the long run for the capitalist
  class either. As Trotsky aptly remarked, "Where there is no work done, there even
  Rockefeller can get nothing."</p>

  <p>The deep-seated pessimism of the bourgeoisie to which we referred earlier is based
  on more comprehensive and more authoritative surveys and rests on the fundamental
  premise that the current crisis which the capitalist world is undergoing is not the
  kind of cyclic crisis which it has experienced over the last 30 years. It is different,
  more like the 1930s. But the bourgeois economists won't say it quite like that.
  However, we do.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in
  its last survey (in its "Outlook") forecast a rather gloomy outlook. The OECD comprises
  the 24 so-called richest capitalist countries. While its surveys are made by
  representatives of their respective governments, it is nevertheless of necessity more
  objective than the press releases that these respective governments issue, which are
  destined for home consumption to dupe the masses.</p>

  <p>Its survey is not only gloomy, but, in the words of the <em>London Economist</em>
  (July 26), it forecasts "that economic growth over the next <strong>ten</strong> (!!)
  years would be slower than the world is accustomed to. " This is a euphemistic way of
  stating that the OECD's projection is capitalist stagnation for at least the next
  decade. What the <em>London Economist</em> sees in this on a worldwide basis is "a
  menacing army" of many, many millions of enraged and hostile unemployed workers in all
  the capitalist countries.</p>

  <p>The <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> has its own comments on the OECD's survey.
  With its large circulation here at home, this mouthpiece of the right-wing of the
  bourgeois press also mutes its pessimism and states that "a return to the high economic
  growth rates and world trade gains of the past 20 years seems unlikely." In plainer
  words, it's really out of the question for a long time.</p>

  <p>One need not rely especially on the OECD's survey. The U.S. government has itself
  admitted that U.S. industry as a whole has been operating at only 69 percent of
  capacity (very low indeed!), even over the last 3 months in which the indicators are
  supposed to show an upward trend. Only mining, oil and natural gas are operating at
  high capacity (<em>New York Times,</em> July 31).</p>

  <p><strong>And the crisis is even deeper!</strong></p>

  <p>It need scarcely be added that the unemployment figures are way beyond the 10
  million figure around which the official statistics seem to hover. The government
  itself admits (Bureau of Census Statistics) that 1.3 million people &mdash; of all
  nationalities &mdash; have been added to the lists of the poor. (That alone should help
  cement class solidarity.) That makes a new officially admitted total of 24.3 million
  below the poverty line, or about 12 percent of the population.</p>

  <p>When one adds to this the amount of people who now qualify for food stamps, one gets
  the true dimensions of the current capitalist crisis.</p>

  <p>The crisis is unlike any of the previous crises over the last 30 years. The
  recovery, assuming but not conceding that it's already on the way, could not by any
  stretch of imagination absorb a minimum of 8 to 9 million unemployed (which would still
  leave a residue of several million unemployed and partially employed, anyway).</p>

  <p>To put the bulk of American industry at the operational level which it experienced
  during 1972-73 would virtually mean adding 30 percent to the current operating capacity
  &mdash; a very tall order indeed for the capitalists.</p>

  <p>One of the really significant economic indicators has always been machine tool
  orders. While they rose above last year, the rise was only because General Motors
  reinstated a cancelled order. Otherwise, this indicator, which usually shows what
  production will be in the near future, showed very little change.</p>

  <p>But basic to any kind of real recovery, even for the short term, are autos and
  housing. This is so because it is precisely these industries which are considered to
  have so-called multiplier effects &mdash; that is, they usually fan out into a host of
  supplier industries such as glass, road building, sewer systems, auto parts, and so on.
  This is absolutely incontestable and agreed to by almost all bourgeois economists. But
  it is precisely these two industries which show the greatest resistance to any kind of
  general "normal" capitalist recovery.</p>

  <p>According to <em>Business Week</em> of July 28, autos, instead of being the
  bellwether of recovery, are really dragging it down at the present time. The <em>New
  York Times</em> of July 27 agrees, "In the auto industry, more than any other business,
  and in Detroit, more than any other city, the recession of 1975 has looked like the
  great depression of the thirties."</p>

  <p>In spite of recalls, the situation is not likely to substantially change or return
  to even the so-called "normal" employment of 1973. Even during the so-called periods of
  prosperity, <strong>sales of automobiles went way beyond the increases in
  employment.</strong> It is a well-known fact that after the minor recession of 1958
  <strong>it took 7 years to return to the previous level of employment by which time the
  companies were producing almost 1.5 times as many vehicles per worker.</strong></p>

  <p>So far as housing goes, none other than the National Association of Home Builders,
  mouthpiece for the building industry, issued a statement attacking President Ford in
  which it said that "the outlook is bleak" and that the Ford administration was
  misleading the public by "issuing unwarranted public expressions of optimism." They
  said that "actual housing starts for the first six months of this year were the lowest
  for any comparable period in 28 years."</p>

  <p>They even went on to say that signs "of any vigorous economic recovery (are absent)
  despite statements to the contrary from high economic sources."</p>

  <p>All of this, obviously taken into account by one of the largest banks in the
  country, prompted the July <em>Economic Letter</em> of the giant First National City
  Bank to say "the spark of consumer interest [that is, purchasing power by the mass of
  the people -SM] so vital to a strong recovery, is not yet in evidence."</p>

  <h3>II. Comparison with 1930s</h3>

  <p>The larger issue to be considered is whether the economic crisis that began last
  year is of the dimensions and gravity of the one that was set off in October 1929 by
  the great Wall Street crash. True enough, there has not been such a cataclysmic crash,
  but the economic depression which is now in full swing more and more resembles the
  period of the thirties. Without the economic crash, it has come about or is coming
  about on the installment plan.</p>

  <p>It is important to recall that the economic crisis that was set off in 1929 actually
  ended around 1939-40. It was the longest period of capitalist stagnation during the
  imperialist epoch. It rivaled and far transcended in intensity and in acuteness the
  economic crisis of 1873, which really lasted up until around 1895. These two long
  stretches, one in the 20th and one in the 19th century, can be compared only because of
  their duration. Both of these long stretches were interrupted by brief intervals of
  economic upswing. But they vary in other respects fundamentally.</p>

  <p>They differ most meaningfully in the fact that the 1873-95 period, of course,
  encompasses the period of competitive capitalism. It was the period when economic
  crisis brought about lowering of the prices of manufactured goods. In a general way the
  whole period of pre-monopoly capitalism was characterized by a lowering of prices of
  manufactured goods brought about by intense capitalist competition and introduction of
  technological and labor-saving devices. There was no question during the entire period
  of an inflationary spiral whose stubbornness and intractability could not be overcome.
  The inflationary period of the Civil War had by and large been overcome.</p>

  <p>That whole period which Lenin chronologically put between 1870 and 1914, the
  outbreak of the imperialist war, was generally the progressive phase of capitalist
  development. This does not mean that it was any less oppressive, but that it had by and
  large plenty of room for upward development.</p>

  <p>The 1920-40 period was wholly different from the long stretch in the 19th century
  which began in 1873. The economic crisis ushered in by the Wall Street crash was
  "solved" by state capitalist intervention which alleviated some of the worst
  consequences wrought by the havoc of the economic collapse. The Rooseveltian New Deal
  and its social legislation gave a fillip to the capitalist economy for a while.</p>

  <p>The dollar was devalued. A gigantic trade offensive was started against the rest of
  the capitalist world. A multitude of government-sponsored make-work projects such as
  the WPA were introduced along with CCC camps, youth labor camps, and a myriad of other
  projects. Millions of dollars were poured into the coffers of the rich at the expense
  of a tremendously enlarged budget deficit.</p>

  <p>Roosevelt allied himself with the large banks and light industry in order to
  artificially stimulate the capitalist economy. It was the beginning of the Keynesian
  era of priming the pump. Nevertheless, by 1937-38, another economic collapse proved
  that the capitalist crisis had really not been overcome. In reality, it was the turn
  towards the Second World War which fueled the renewed economic upturn in 1940. Heavy
  industry grew along with all the ammunition factories and the establishment of new
  aviation plants and other war-making facilities. This together with the draft set a new
  phase in the economic cycle.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter is that there has not been a normal, that is, spontaneous,
  economic upturn in the classical sense of the word for the capitalist economic
  cycle.</p>

  <p><strong>Monopoly and the military</strong></p>

  <p>Whereas the 1873 stretch was accompanied by lowering the prices of manufactured
  goods, the entire imperialist epoch has been characterized by ever-rising prices of
  manufactured goods. This is so in spite of all the technological developments,
  innovations, and labor-saving devices. Monopoly maintains (that is, rigs) prices
  artificially and extracts enormous, extortionate super-profits.</p>

  <p>There was a lowering of prices for a while during the most acute stage of the
  economic crisis of the thirties, but it was short-lived, and the upward spiral of price
  hikes resumed unabated. This was partly due to the rigging of prices by the giant
  monopolies, but even more to monumental war expenditures of such size and magnitude
  that they actually depreciated the value of the currency, not only in the United States
  but virtually throughout the whole capitalist world. Currency inflation thereafter, the
  devaluation of the various monetary units of the capitalist countries, made currency
  wars a prelude to direct military conflicts.</p>

  <p>In every way, monopoly capitalism has so distorted and transformed the normal
  functioning of the capitalist system that it is virtually impossible for the system to
  function without some of the strictest controls, that is, the direct fusion of the
  capitalist state with the economy.</p>

  <p>At the end of the Second World War, it was plain that after the havoc wrought by the
  military conflict and the virtual breakdown of the capitalist system in Europe, a
  capitalist economic decline was in the offing as soon as the postwar reconstruction
  period had ended, which might have been somewhere around 1949.</p>

  <p>However, the few symptoms of economic decline that made themselves felt primarily in
  the United States were soon completely submerged by the Korean war. This was followed
  by the Vietnam war.</p>

  <p>Even before the U.S. suffered the catastrophic defeat handed to it by the Cambodian
  and Vietnamese people last April, it was obvious that American finance capital, and
  along with it, but to a limited extent, European and Japanese finance capital, would go
  into a deep tailspin.</p>

  <p>As we indicated last year there has been no normal capitalist recovery. From this it
  follows that even if there is going to be a limited period of capitalist upturn, the
  world capitalist economy is headed for a long period of stagnation. And the real
  question which this poses is whether the capitalist system can survive it, given
  contemporary political conditions.</p>

  <p><strong>They thought expansion would never end</strong></p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the question may still be validly raised as to why this economic
  crisis should necessarily differ in duration and intensity from the previous four or
  five economic crises which the capitalist system experienced over the last 30 years.
  The bourgeois world has viewed this lengthy stretch of economic history from the end of
  the Second World War practically up to 1973 as having been characterized by the
  greatest wave of capitalist expansion and prosperity (never mind the 5 or 6 million
  unemployed at the time, the millions on welfare, etc.).</p>

  <p>The most remarkable aspect of these last three decades has been that the four or
  five cyclical crises were of a mild and moderate character and of relatively short
  duration. Not one of them even lasted a whole year. In fact, it appeared to bourgeois
  economists that the expedients which the capitalist politicians began to apply after
  the great crash of 1929, especially during the Rooseveltian era and all the way down to
  the late 1960s, had virtually eliminated crises from capitalist development.</p>

  <p>It began to be the vogue in bourgeois liberal circles to speak of Marxism as having
  been disqualified by experience. In the universities in particular, bourgeois liberal
  economists, especially such luminaries as Kenneth Galbraith and others, were most
  lyrical about the expansionist possibilities of capitalism. So pervasive was the idea
  that capitalism was reorganizing itself and eliminating its dangerous defects by
  self-regulation &mdash; that is, by eliminating anarchy and chaos inherent in
  capitalist production &mdash; that in 1969 no less than the Council of Economic
  Advisors to the President, that is, the principal advisors to the U.S. government on
  economic matters and generally representative of the views of the dominant sections of
  the bourgeoisie, took it upon itself to make the following rash statement: "The
  vigorous and unbroken expansion of the last eight years is in dramatic contrast to the
  thirty month average duration of previous expansion. No longer is the performance of
  the American economy generally interpreted in terms of stages of the business cycle.
  The forces making for economic fluctuations have been contained through the active use
  of monetary and fiscal policies."</p>

  <p>Thus we see that the view of the U.S. government's most able advisors was that the
  capitalist economy could no longer be regarded in terms of the "stages of the
  capitalist business cycle." They in fact boasted that economic fluctuations, that is,
  the violent ups and downs of the capitalist economy, had "been contained" through the
  hocus-pocus of "active use of monetary and fiscal policy."</p>

  <p>The external laws of capitalist development had been eliminated, they claimed, and
  capitalist prosperity was from now on apparently to be an eternal process.</p>
  <hr />

  <p><strong><em>How the stock experts . . .</em></strong></p>

  <p>"It was not so much the business recovery nor its anticipation which produced the
  recent rise in the stock market but rather the fact that business was weak. This
  weakness permitted inflation and interest rates to subside and the flow of money to
  shift from inventory-building and real estate to securities (stocks) ..."</p>

  <p><strong><em>. . . see their system!</em></strong></p>

  <p>"Finally, and without pretending to be profound, is Western civilization on the
  decline? The subject is relevant to the investor because analysis of this would shed
  light on the parallel question of whether common stocks are entering a long-term
  uptrend, during which declines can generally be ignored, or whether we have witnessed
  simply a rally in a bear market."</p>

  <h3>III. Military collapse and economic consequences</h3>

  <p>The learned counsellors to the imperialist establishment had, however, inadvertently
  left out two minor details regarding that 8-year period &mdash; the Vietnam war and the
  military budget.</p>

  <p>From 1961 to 1969 &mdash; the period covered by the report of the President's
  economic council &mdash; U.S. spending for military purposes amounted to no less than
  $546 billion! In the year 1969 the military budget alone was $81 billion, or 56 percent
  of the federal government's total budget of $146 billion (<em>Pentagon Capitalism</em>
  by Prof. Seymour Melman, p. 72).</p>

  <p>Imperialist finance capital regarded the largest chunk of this fabulous sum of money
  as a "sound investment" from which it would derive enormous super-profits if the
  Southeast Asia adventure turned out to be a success.</p>

  <p>The collapse of this mad dream began to make itself felt soon after the 1968 Tet
  offensive. Johnson's resignation underlined this. And the collapse of the Penn Central
  (basically civilian) and Lockheed (almost all military), which had been artificially
  maintained by further subsidies, brought home that the post-World War II era of U.S.
  imperialist expansion and imperialist successful adventures was nearing an end.</p>

  <p>Military investment is only a "sound one" when it is successful, when it is able to
  conquer vast territories with an abundance of raw materials and sources of cheap labor
  and a means for the disposal of capitalist surplus production.</p>

  <p><strong>$104 billion to produce inflation and disaster</strong></p>

  <p>Military expenditures, especially of the gargantuan dimensions of the last few
  decades, and particularly in a period of the contracting fortunes of finance capital,
  <strong>instead of acting as a stimulant to capitalist expansion and accumulation turns
  into its dialectical opposite and becomes a depressant. Like any drug, it may operate
  to accelerate recovery from illness, but if administered on an ever-continuing and
  ever-increasing basis without let up, it becomes toxic and poisons the
  organism.</strong></p>

  <p>Only recently, Senator Kennedy after a visit to the Middle East ventured to remark
  that "the U.S. is becoming hooked on the heroin of arms buildup in the Persian Gulf. "
  But it is not only the Persian Gulf, it's also in Europe, Latin America, parts of Asia,
  anywhere on the face of the globe where the U.S. can dispose of its ever-increasing
  military equipment. Kennedy's cure for the "heroin-addicted" military-industrial
  complex was to "declare a moratorium for six months." He has no more a solution to the
  problem than the "heroin addicts" in the Pentagon.</p>

  <p>From the foregoing it follows that the military budget, which for 1976 is calculated
  to be $104 billion, is not likely to have the effect it had in the previous decades
  when military adventures paid off by enslaving huge sections of the globe. In the final
  analysis the manufacture and sales of planes, guns, missiles, and tanks must show an
  exchange, even if not an equivalent one, in the form of other commodities or other
  visible means of economic wealth.</p>

  <p>Even when the military expenditures operate as an economic stimulus, they distort
  the functioning of the capitalist system in an irretrievable way. In the first place,
  military production preempts vast resources and skills to a degree which undermines and
  makes virtually impossible an easy, or even protracted, conversion to civilian
  production. The caste system, and the military-industrial complex which feeds it,
  becomes stubbornly entrenched and even great progressive political struggles of a mass
  character can barely move them.</p>

  <p>Military spending is one of the principal causes of absolutely inordinate price
  inflation. This in turn affects the entire civilian economy. The military does not
  really buy in the open market with open competitive bidding. Prices are continually
  rigged upward, and woe unto those administrators who even disclose the more malodorous
  wheelings and dealings! Because price inflation as a result of military spending is so
  steep, it permeates all levels of civilian production and disrupts the civilian
  capacity for normal capitalist development.</p>

  <p>The eagerness with which the liberals in the Senate and the House are reversing
  themselves on the military budget &mdash; witness the turnarounds on the Diego Garcia
  naval base, the B-1 bomber, and the very recent House subcommittee approval to build
  the F-18 Navy plane &mdash; is a certain harbinger that the worthy representatives of
  the liberal establishment have taken to the "heroin of arms building" themselves, and
  with a vengeance.</p>

  <p>It will be of no avail. The results will be of a catastrophic political character
  and can only lead to the most dangerous military adventures.</p>

  <p>We shall consider next the general causes of inflation which were slowly building up
  over the past 30 years but which are more intractable in this period, the period which
  has been ushered in by the collapse of the U.S. war effort in Laos, Cambodia, and
  Vietnam.</p>

  <p><small>&mdash; August 1, 1975</small></p>

  <h3>IV. More on the real nature of the current crisis</h3>

  <p>Economic historians of the current capitalist crisis will undoubtedly &mdash; and
  correctly &mdash; regard last year's collapse of the Herstadt Bank and the Franklin
  National Bank as its starting point. It may however also be traced back to the
  financial crisis of 1970.</p>

  <p>The latter ushered in the collapse of one of the giant railroad networks in the
  country, the Penn Central. Not at all coincidental was the virtual bankruptcy of
  Lockheed, one of the multi-billion dollar defense contractors.</p>

  <p>(The collapse of these two corporate giants should be seen against the background of
  the Vietnamese Tet offensive which marked the turning point in the fortunes of U.S.
  imperialism although not fully recognized as such at the time.)</p>

  <p>It is deeply significant that five years afterward, both of these great capitalist
  establishments are as sick as ever. Transfusions of many millions of dollars have been
  of little avail.</p>

  <p>These two establishments are in many respects representative of the most substantial
  portion of capitalist industry in this country. One, the Penn Central, is a civilian
  firm, and the other an arms producer. The fact that both could be so terribly ailing at
  the same time bolsters the view that it is not one of the "moderate" cyclical crises
  that occurred in the past three decades but the beginning of a protracted period of
  capitalist stagnation in many respects similar to the period of the thirties, which
  were also marked by brief periods of recovery.</p>

  <p><strong>Real cause and effect</strong></p>

  <p>The resurgence of the current spiral of inflation is evident in the sharp upturn in
  the Consumer Price Index for June and probably for July.</p>

  <p>But there are much more serious indications, such as the impending price increases
  in aluminum, steel and copper, which in turn affect most of the products destined for
  popular consumption. Price increases in monopolized industries such as these are the
  ones that really set the pattern for all the rest. The general inflation grows directly
  out of the unchecked price hikes of the monopolies.</p>

  <p>Inflation, however, is usually considered to be <strong>the cause of the
  crisis</strong> rather than the <strong>effect.</strong> Capitalist theories of
  inflation abound and all, without exception, are calculated to throw the onus of
  responsibility for the ravages of it from the shoulders of the ruling class onto those
  of the working class and the oppressed people. (They are too greedy for bread!)</p>

  <p>At the moment, capitalist economists, the press, and other news media are hard at
  work making the Soviet grain deal and Arab oil the principal cause for the renewed
  surge of the inflationary spiral.</p>

  <p>Capitalist theories of inflation almost always lump together the inflation of
  ancient times, the feudal period, the period of commercial capitalism, the competitive
  stages of capitalism, along with that of monopoly capitalism.</p>

  <p>What they extrapolate from these different modes of production and different periods
  in the capitalist system itself are meaningless generalizations which do not throw any
  light on the causes of present day inflation, but rather obscure them.</p>

  <p><strong>Who gains, who loses</strong></p>

  <p>By lumping all periods of inflation into one pot they hide the driving forces behind
  each inflationary period and ignore the various classes which gained or lost in the
  course of the inflation. It is true that in the current period there are present some
  of the same characteristics prevalent in different historical situations. But the
  results were different.</p>

  <p>For instance, the inflationary period in the United States resulting from the Civil
  War was followed thereafter by a deflationary period. However, the Civil War itself, of
  which the inflation was merely a monetary expression, gave an impetus later to a
  tempestuous forward development of American capitalism.</p>

  <p>Today there may be some remnants of the kind of inflation that existed in ancient
  times, in feudal times, and in the period of competitive capitalism. (The devaluation
  of the dollar is no less a coin clipping operation than that which the princes and
  monarchs of the period of early commercial capitalism employed!)</p>

  <p>Under modern capitalism, price inflation as well as monetary inflation has existed
  and can exist wherever commodity exchange exists on a large-scale basis. All price
  inflation of course is a symptom of instability. And currency manipulation is a symptom
  of the inherent instability in the capitalist system as a whole.</p>

  <p>The currency wars following the First World War, including the one begun in the
  early seventies, are symptoms of decay and a manifestation of sharpening antagonisms in
  inter-imperialist relations.</p>

  <p><strong>From competition to monopoly</strong></p>

  <p>The inflation which has been most characteristic since the First World War &mdash;
  with slight declines between the First and Second World War &mdash; differs
  fundamentally from the inflation of all previous epochs.</p>

  <p>In particular it differs from the inflation of <strong>the competitive
  stage</strong> of capitalism. During the competitive stage of capitalism the prices of
  manufactured goods commodities as a whole, were in a more or less <strong>constant
  decline.</strong> One must remember what Marx said in <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>.
  That it was cheap commodities that heavily contributed to "breaking down the Chinese
  walls."</p>

  <p>Because there were so many competitors, <strong>competition was a spur</strong> to
  the production of cheap commodities and in that sense capitalism was, of course, on the
  upgrade in its developing state.</p>

  <p>Of course capitalists are always interested in higher prices, not only for
  investment, but because it brings higher profits. But the competition during the
  so-called progressive stage of capitalism operated as a barrier to higher prices and
  the success of this or that manufacturer lay in underselling his competitor and in
  lowering the price of his product.</p>

  <p>But the centralization of the means of production in fewer and fewer hands converted
  the capitalist competition into <strong>capitalist monopoly,</strong> and prices began
  to artificially skyrocket and, in fact, became still more rigged.</p>

  <p>Therein lies the general cause for chronic capitalist inflation.</p>

  <p>If we compare the whole price range of commodities, particularly of wholesale prices
  beginning with the first worldwide capitalist crisis of 1825 all the way down to the
  turn of the century, we cannot but note that the prices of manufactured goods were
  generally on the decline during that entire period but only began to rise steeply with
  the development of monopolies on a large scale.</p>

  <p>There is absolutely no way to get around this except to abolish monopoly capitalism
  in the means of production and for the workers to take over the economy and plan it on
  a rational basis.</p>

  <p><strong>War dreams down the drain</strong></p>

  <p>However, on top of the general cause of inflation arising out of monopoly
  capitalism, there is the inflation that is caused by military expenditures and
  imperialist wars which still further heighten the inflation and accelerate the tendency
  towards capitalist stagnation.</p>

  <p>As we mentioned earlier, during the 8-year period from 1961 to 1969, that the
  Council of Economic Advisors to the President alluded to, the government spent $546
  billion for military purposes.</p>

  <p>The IOUs (that's what the dollars really are which are floating all over Asia,
  Africa, Latin America, and Europe, not to speak of the United States which paid for the
  military equipment) are really that much water in the circulatory system of the
  capitalist economy. The real equipment has either been destroyed, given away, or tucked
  away in mothballs.</p>

  <p>But the primary consideration for it &mdash; we speak here of the monetary
  considerations for these IOUs &mdash; was the dream of obtaining vast new markets in
  Southeast Asia and other parts of the world which, with the collapse of the Vietnam
  adventure, went down the drain. And hopes for reviving it are the dreams of madmen in
  the Pentagon.</p>

  <p>The current economic crisis differs from the moderate cyclical crises of the last
  three decades in that the U.S. has literally run out of imperialist wars &mdash; for
  the moment at least.</p>

  <p>The crisis also occurs at a time when the total area available to the U.S. for the
  extraction of surplus value and for the disposal of surplus production at a profit has
  become circumscribed and narrowed, making a renewed cycle of capitalist production,
  reaching a peak higher than the previous one, as was the case after the previous
  crises, exceptionally remote.</p>

  <p><strong>Propaganda against Arab oil countries</strong></p>

  <p>It will not do to explain the resurgence of the capitalist inflation on the basis of
  the rise in Arab oil prices and the enormous surpluses which the Arab oil-producing
  countries are supposedly filling their treasuries with.</p>

  <p>A year ago, the capitalist media was dominated even more than it is today with the
  oil crisis and the giant surpluses which the Arab oil countries were said to be
  accumulating in their coffers. The propaganda virtually turned into a veritable
  anti-Arab hysteria which only slightly receded as of now.</p>

  <p>Last year, we must recall, the bourgeoisie was predicting that the surpluses from
  oil revenues in the OPEC countries would be so large that it would almost be impossible
  to "recycle" (to get back) into the Wall Street banks. The amount of billions the OPEC
  oil-producing countries were said to be accumulating ranged all the way from $250
  billion to $650 billion.</p>

  <p>We pointed out at the time that even if this were true, all that it meant was that
  paper money, or checks drawn to the accounts of the OPEC countries, would be ultimately
  deposited in the huge banks of the imperialist countries such as Chase Manhattan, First
  National City, Morgan Guaranty Trust, and the big London, German, French, and, of
  course, Swiss banks.</p>

  <p>The way we answered the questions regarding the so-called OPEC surpluses was, that
  as long as the OPEC countries remained under bourgeois compradore domination and as
  long as they were in the orbit of the capitalist world and remained dependent on it, it
  merely meant that in exchange for oil the oil-producing states were in return given
  IOUs by the imperialist countries which, under contemporary conditions, were destined
  for deposit in imperialist banks.</p>

  <p>Of course, some of this money would be utilized for industrial equipment
  agricultural and manufactured commodities, and a variety of other imports. But this
  would be only a drop in the bucket and even over an extended period of years would come
  nowhere near to attaining the technical know-how and equipment necessary to create a
  modern industrial bourgeois state.</p>

  <p>The reality of the situation is that the bulk of the imports into Arab oil-producing
  states is in the form of military equipment, which to date comes close to $20 billion
  worth.</p>

  <p><strong>Reason for the turnaround</strong></p>

  <p>But what has happened to the predictions of the tremendous flow of "surplus dollars"
  &mdash; so-called petrodollars &mdash; into the treasuries of the OPEC countries? The
  very banks and government officials who raised such a fierce storm about these
  petrodollars have now quietly changed their approach without letting the broad public
  know about it.</p>

  <p>The $250 to $650 billion surplus has now been downgraded almost to a
  <strong>deficit.</strong> This fantastic turnaround is not altogether due to capitalist
  propaganda turning the faucet on and off as they generally do whenever it suits their
  purposes.</p>

  <p>The turnaround is also due to the ravages of the capitalist depression. The cut in
  oil consumption in some of the capitalist countries is the result of the industrial
  slowdown &mdash; of a decline in capitalist world production due to the depression.
  (This, of course, has not forced, as of now, the OPEC countries to cut the price of
  oil.)</p>

  <p>Thus, the monthly <em>Economic Letter</em> of the First National City Bank for June
  1975 makes the following cynical observation about the oil surpluses in OPEC
  countries.</p>

  <p>"So what began in 1973-4 as a ferocious tiger was first declawed and is now becoming
  a Cheshire Cat." Two other giant banks, the Irving Trust Co. and the Morgan Guaranty
  Trust, have made similar observations.</p>

  <p>What an object lesson in the manipulation of public opinion by the banks and the
  government! One only has to remember that it has been barely six months since
  Kissinger, Schlessinger, Ford, the <em>New York Times,</em> The <em>Washington
  Post</em>, and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> let loose the most ominous
  sabre-rattling, shaking their nuclear fists at the Arab countries and shouting
  themselves hoarse that it was these Arab oil surpluses and price increases which were
  strangling the world capitalist economy. It now turns out, as they admit themselves,
  that the exact opposite is the case.</p>

  <p>Of course the oil price increases have added to world inflation but that is not the
  basic cause of the galloping global character of the inflation. The OPEC in its
  mid-year report of a year ago credited the oil price increases over-all with a mere two
  percent.</p>

  <p><strong>Colonial oil and imperialist overproduction</strong></p>

  <p>The fabulous wealth in the form of oil buried beneath the ground of the OPEC
  countries remains wealth all right. But so long as the OPEC countries remain oppressed
  nations and imperialism controls the basic fabric of the world capitalist economy, the
  OPEC countries, in spite of undoubted economic advances, are nevertheless the dominated
  ones and by no means the domineering ones in the world capitalist order.</p>

  <p>The roots of the general capitalist crisis lie in capitalist overproduction and the
  inability of the capitalist class to dispose at a profit of the tremendous products
  which continually flow out of the giant mines, mills, and factories.</p>

  <p>This over-all crisis coincides with the <strong>general</strong> crisis of
  capitalism which was ushered in as long ago as the end of the First World War and has
  only been interrupted by brief periods of capitalist recovery and devastating
  imperialist wars and military adventures.</p>

  <p>What imparts particular acuteness to the present economic crisis is that it comes at
  a time of maturing over &mdash; all political crisis in all the leading imperialist
  countries. It is to this crisis that we must now address ourselves for the economic
  crisis will be solved by political means and not by the automatic processes of
  capitalist development.</p>

  <p><small>&mdash; August 4, 1975</small></p>

  <h3>V. A bank fails</h3>

  <p>NEW YORK, Aug. 25 &mdash; It was nice and sunny in Eldora, Iowa, that midsummer day
  in 1974. Hardly anybody would have thought anything extraordinary had happened. Yet if
  on that Monday you had had to cash a check or make a deposit at the First National Bank
  of Eldora, the only one in this little town, you might have noticed on your way in or
  out a slight change in the name of the bank. It had become the Second Bank of
  Eldora.</p>

  <p>No, it wasn't that another bank had nosed it out of first place. Something else had
  happened.</p>

  <p>From late Thursday afternoon the week before until the wee hours of Sunday morning,
  there had been feverish activity by a handful of people in Eldora and in Washington who
  were trying desperately to see that this tiny little bank, one out of 20,000 in the
  country, should not sink.</p>

  <p>The federal bank regulator, James Smith, who had jurisdiction over that bank and
  5,000 others, also had a sentimental reason for taking a special interest in it. His
  mother lived in Eldora, and it was kind of his home town. But try as hard as he could,
  by Saturday he had to throw in the towel and put the bank up for sale at an auction. By
  Monday morning the sale had cleared and the First National had gone under.</p>

  <p>To the citizens of Eldora it seemed as though nothing much had happened, merely a
  change in name. Since deposits up to $15,000 were insured and everything else in the
  bank appeared as before, it didn't seem as though there was anything to worry about.
  But the bank's bad debts had to be called in, and this meant that some business firms
  either had to cut back their business activity, cut their staff, or lay off workers.
  That was noticed, especially by the people concerned.</p>

  <p><strong>A symptom?</strong></p>

  <p>Was this failure of a tiny bank deep in the heart of mid-America a signal of an
  impending storm? Would the federal bank regulator, also the controller of U.S.
  currency, initiate an immediate in-depth study of what was going on in all the banks in
  his jurisdiction to see if a financial and economic catastrophe was coming?</p>

  <p>James Smith admitted later that he had "sensed trouble." So he decided to look into
  the general health of the banking system. After all, he said to himself, perhaps early
  detection could prevent a financial and economic crisis. That would make him a real
  hero in the banking and business fraternity.</p>

  <p>After all, as the federal bank regulator and the controller of the U.S. currency, he
  was in charge of a vast army &mdash; there were 2,500 members on his staff. They could
  be mobilized quickly and ordered to look into the situation right away and report to
  him. The banks were legally bound to open their books to him or face penalties. By law
  he was charged with the responsibility of monitoring about 5,000 of the 20,000 banks in
  the country. Among these 5,000 were some of the very biggest. He could also reach into
  the 15,000 other banks by a variety of legal and administrative powers available to him
  under existing law. And he had wide latitude in judgment in determining the number and
  size of banks, the structure of this industry, and even the degree of competition.</p>

  <p>He and Arthur Burns, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, were really in
  charge of the whole banking and financial structure of the U.S. The comprehensive study
  he would undertake would help him decide whether what had happened in Eldora was an
  accident or an emerging phenomenon. With all the techniques, money, men, and vast
  authority at his command, perhaps he could determine whether a dangerous trend in the
  economy was surfacing.</p>

  <p><strong>Capitalist crisis</strong></p>

  <p>Little did he know, or appear to know, that he was treading a beaten path. Since
  1825 when the first worldwide economic crisis developed, learned men in high places, in
  government, in industry, and in the universities, had tried not only to fathom the
  meaning of the so-called disturbances in the economic system, but had tried by a
  variety of mediums to change their course or eliminate them. There had been no success.
  All measures taken in that direction had proven to be mere palliatives. At most they
  had delayed the oncoming crisis and more often as in recent years had diverted it by
  driving the crisis deeper into the organism, only to find that it exploded with greater
  force and vigor than before.</p>

  <p>For the crises are the inevitable result of the inherent contradictions in
  capitalist economy &mdash; where production is carried out on a collective basis but is
  appropriated on the basis of individual gain. Moreover, the crises occur independently
  of the will of the capitalists themselves. This law of capitalist production has the
  force of a natural law.</p>

  <p>Understanding this will explain why no amount of comprehensive investigation or
  study would be helpful in obviating a developing economic crisis.</p>

  <p>And it explains why James Smith, federal regulator of the banks, was frustrated in
  his efforts to save the Eldora bank and why, shortly thereafter, he found himself
  immersed up to his ears in a much bigger sea of financial troubles &mdash; the collapse
  of the Franklin National Bank.</p>

  <p><strong>Franklin National confirmed a crisis</strong></p>

  <p>All the vast powers Smith had at his command &mdash; specialists of all kinds, the
  help of computerized technology of the most sophisticated type &mdash; did not equip
  him to comprehend the oncoming catastrophe at the Franklin National Bank. For days and
  weeks on end, he and a large number of officials from his staff, from the Federal
  Reserve Bank's staff, and from the big banks in New York, worked on a monumental rescue
  mission to save this tottering giant from collapse, to save a multi-billion-dollar bank
  with international connections and significance.</p>

  <p>Officially the trouble was characterized as foreign exchange losses. But in reality
  it was unrestrained monetary speculation on the international arena. In the classical,
  competitive stage of capitalist development, such foreign exchange speculation was a
  normal accompaniment to international trade and commerce. However, the speculation
  which has been rife particularly since World War II has its origins in the devaluation
  (or rather debasement and depreciation) of the dollar and other currencies &mdash; a
  symptom of severe inter-imperialist rivalries and capitalist instability. This has been
  especially true since the end of the Vietnam war, when the boom-bust cycle of
  capitalist decline has reemerged with a vengeance and the so-called long boom, mostly
  the result of the Korean and Vietnamese wars, has drawn to an end.</p>

  <p>Viewed in this light, the collapse of the Franklin National Bank was no more
  accidental than was that of the tiny First National Bank of Eldora. But the crisis of a
  multi-billion-dollar bank provokes a lot more attention, a lot more effort, and more
  desperate rescue measures than that of a small-town bank. It is no wonder that vast
  transfusions into the dying organism of the Franklin National Bank were soon hurried.
  The big banks in New York were mobilized in this giant effort. Eleven of them,
  including Chase, First National City, and Manufacturers Hanover sunk in $250 million.
  The effort was necessary, it was thought, because it could avoid a worldwide financial
  crisis.</p>

  <p><strong>Billion-dollar rescue fails</strong></p>

  <p>After some changes in the management, the introduction of new efficiency measures
  and exposure of some of the shady practices of the Franklin National (but no shadier
  than those of the other banks), an effort was made to make it function. But it
  wouldn't. After the transfusion of $250 million, the Federal Reserve Bank itself
  stepped in with a billion dollars &mdash; but by then the bank was already finished and
  as in Eldora, if you went to cash a check or make a deposit you saw a new name on the
  bank window: European American.</p>

  <p>What the collapse of the Franklin National Bank showed was that the financial crisis
  was worldwide, that the phenomenon which had been observed in Eldora was also to
  surface in West Germany with the collapse of the Herstadt Bank, a giant on the European
  continent.</p>

  <p>What is really important today, nearly a year after the Franklin collapse, is that
  the very banks who were so generous in offering their transfusion to the Franklin
  National are themselves in trouble.</p>

  <h3>VI. Why the banks are assaulting NYC</h3>

  <p>Therein lies the real clue to the assault on the city of New York and its millions
  of people &mdash; especially the poor, the workers, and the many millions who have
  toiled to make this city the great metropolis it is today.</p>

  <p>These very banks have stuffed in their vaults billions upon billions of IOUs. This
  money has vastly depreciated as a result of the Korean war, the Vietnam war, and the
  continued parasitic production of armaments by the military-industrial complex &mdash;
  the production of planes, tanks, guns, and missiles, all most sophisticated and costly,
  which brings no material return beneficial to industry or to the people as a whole,
  particularly the working people.</p>

  <p>All this takes place on the crest of a capitalist crisis of over-production. The
  banks are the central nervous system of the economic structure of the capitalist
  system. Their health reflects the state of industry, shipping, mining, commerce, etc.
  The latter are in a state of utter decline and stagnation. But IOUs printed by the
  government continue to pile up in the banks and flood all the arteries of world
  capitalist commerce and trade.</p>

  <p>It's the dead hand of past imperialist wars and adventures which holds back the
  future, keeps the capitalist machine in a state of stagnation, unable to obtain new
  areas for exploitation and obstructed everywhere by heroic resistance from rebellious,
  underdeveloped countries.</p>

  <p>The ruling class is impelled more and more to overcome the crisis by shifting it
  onto the shoulders of the workers &mdash; Black, white, Chicano &mdash; especially the
  poorest. The banks are in the vanguard of this offensive. That is what has to be
  realized and clearly understood. They are looking for the weakest link, where to aim an
  assault.</p>

  <p>The banks have naturally seized upon the finances of the large cities as their
  primary target. This is not hard to understand. A considerable number of IOUs in the
  vaults of the biggest banks are from municipal corporations &mdash; big cities like New
  York. The big banks have many notes, bills, bonds, and various other financial
  instrumentalities from the cities.</p>

  <p>The banks have always been especially eager to purchase these forms of indebtedness
  from big cities like New York. One good reason is the high interest on the city's
  bonds. Another equally cogent reason is that these bonds are tax-exempt. This is
  especially helpful for the millionaires, the very rich, who alone can buy them in large
  numbers. It's their tax shelter. The workers have no shelter like that at all. They pay
  out millions in sales taxes, tolls, cigarette taxes, and hundreds of hidden indirect
  taxes. There is no shelter for the workers at all.</p>

  <p>But for the very rich, municipals have always been a good buy precisely because they
  enable them to avoid taxes and at the same time garner in extortionate interest rates.
  Any danger of depreciation in the value of these bonds, notes, or bills immediately
  makes the city government a target of attack. Through the city officialdom, the bankers
  can strike a blow at the living standards of those who work for the city and all who
  live in the city, particularly the mass of the workers and unemployed.</p>

  <p><strong>They've done it before</strong></p>

  <p>A bird's-eye view of what has happened since the turn of the century in the struggle
  of the banks as exploiters and oppressors of the city is extremely instructive. Let's
  take New York City as an example.</p>

  <p>In 1907 the U.S. experienced a tremendous financial crisis. At that time the city of
  New York came under severe attack from the press. The attack, except for a change of
  verbiage, was in substance the same as today's. The city was "living beyond its means,"
  the poor and working people were "to blame for the crisis." Yet in 1907 there was no
  sanitation union to blame, no public employees' union, no teachers' union. There was no
  welfare system at all aside from Salvation Army-type relief. So-called charitable
  organizations, poor houses, and soup kitchens were the only things left for the
  unemployed and the needy.</p>

  <p>Yet it was the poor who were blamed and the cry was that the city was "living beyond
  its means." There was no Federal Reserve Bank at the time to which even small banks
  could appeal. And there was little if any bank regulation to check on the banks. One of
  the leading banks, the Knickerbocker Trust Co., had failed to sell an issue of New York
  City bonds. The furor created in the press by this hastened the financial crisis and
  panic.</p>

  <p>It was then that President Theodore Roosevelt and Secretary of the Treasury George
  Cortelyou worked together with J. P. Morgan to "bail out" the city. They did so by
  putting the city in virtual hock to J. P. Morgan and Co. Mayor McClellan became the
  errand boy for J. P. Morgan in the same way that Mayor Beame is now acting on behalf of
  the banks which, through the medium of big MAC and other stratagems, are subjugating
  the city and its people.</p>

  <p>In those days almost 70 years ago, it was said that, once a centralized banking
  system like the Federal Reserve Bank of today was established, panics and financial and
  economic crisis could be avoided or substantially reduced so that no city would ever
  again become enslaved to the bankers as New York City had become enslaved to J.P.
  Morgan in 1907. Nevertheless in 1933, notwithstanding the existence of the Federal
  Reserve Bank, the "bank of last resort," a capitalist economic crisis crashed down on
  the heads of the people of New York. With slight modifications, the exact scenario that
  had occurred between the Morgan bank, Mayor McClellan, and Teddy Roosevelt in 1907
  again took place in New York. This time it was Mayor O'Brien and there were both
  Rockefeller and Morgan banks. Once again New York City was in the vest pocket of the
  bankers as collateral security to them. The politicians in charge of the city were
  encharged by the bankers with squeezing the last drop of blood out of the mass of the
  people.</p>

  <p>The city officials, with the mayor at the head, who were pledged to promote the good
  and welfare of the people and defend them against the banks' depredations, were in
  reality delivering them to the tender mercy of the banks.</p>

  <p>Now once again, as in 1907, the arguments being made in the capitalist press are the
  same as those made in that earlier crisis of American capitalism. The chaotic scenario
  being played out today reflects the same havoc visited upon the people as a result of
  the objective effect of the capitalist crisis. Always in these cases of cyclical ups
  and downs, the rewards go to the greedy while the capitalist politicians prey upon the
  needy.</p>

  <p><strong>Reserve bank to the rescue &mdash; of whom?</strong></p>

  <p>It was shown that the problem of the city of New York is not a local phenomenon, nor
  even an urban one alone, but part and parcel of a worldwide crisis of the capitalist
  system when the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board was forced to say that the
  Federal Reserve Bank, that is, the government, will come to the rescue.</p>

  <p>Not, mind you, to the rescue of the city and its inhabitants &mdash; but to the
  rescue of the banks in case the city defaults.</p>

  <p>The catastrophe, you see, is not unemployment, loss of social services, health care,
  sanitation, and so forth. The catastrophe lies in the failure of the millionaires,
  multi-millionaires, and billionaires to get their regular coupons &mdash; the
  extortionate interest from city bonds, notes, and bills. As in other capitalist crises,
  the government is prone to collect bad debts that the big banks have accumulated. The
  government will take care of <strong>that.</strong> After that is done, new cruel
  taxation on the working people will be levied and collected to make good the bad debts
  accumulated by the big banks.</p>

  <p>It must be recognized that the insolvency of some of the largest cities in the
  United States is merely a part of the general bankruptcy of the capitalist system in
  its period of decline, when it depends on imperialist wars, adventures, and parasitic
  military production by the military-industrial complex to solve an economic
  depression.</p>

  <h3>VII. The tactics behind inflation</h3>

  <p>The origin of the crisis of the cities lies, therefore, in the general crisis of
  capitalism in this country. The capitalists are trying to overcome their crisis by a
  general assault on the mass of the workers, striking at the weakest link first: cutting
  social services, health, sanitation, fire control, and education.</p>

  <p>A broad, frontal attack on the <strong>organized</strong> working class, especially
  in basic industries, is at the present time not possible, although it is precisely what
  the ruling class has in mind. Thus fueling the fires of inflation becomes an indirect
  method of cutting the living standards of the population as a whole and the workers in
  particular. But a frontal attack, which they would find more desirable, is more
  dangerous for them because it would enhance the class struggle, raise the class
  consciousness of the workers, and be a prelude to the political organization of the
  working class on an independent class basis.</p>

  <p>It follows from this that the most effective answer to the crisis of the cities lies
  in a general working class counter-offensive against the ruling class which would unite
  Blacks, Chicanos, Puerto Ricans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and whites, men and
  women, in a common struggle against Washington and Wall Street. Such a struggle should
  not be confined merely to one city or one region but should have the character of a
  nationwide class approach.</p>
