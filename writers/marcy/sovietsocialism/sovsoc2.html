  <h5>Soviet Socialism: Utopian or Scientific [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Was Russian Revolution utopian?</h1>
  
  <p>Now that the counterrevolution is fully in the
  saddle in the USSR, and its wrecking crews are breaking down every progressive and
  revolutionary reform shall we say that this too was a form of utopianism? Was not the
  Soviet Union in reality as isolated as was New Harmony? Was it not an attempt to build
  an oasis within a world imperialist environment that was rent by malignant class
  contradictions?

  <p>To begin with, the architects of the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of
  the proletariat in the USSR, particularly its leader, Lenin, could never be described
  as visionaries. On the contrary, their assessment of the prospects for the USSR
  following the victory of the October Revolution was as realistic as any social and
  political analysis could possibly be.</p>

  <p>The architects of the revolution were not inclined to rely on the inherent goodness
  of the bourgeoisie &mdash; the Achilles heel of the Owenites. The Bolsheviks had been
  schooled in the scientific socialism of Marx and Engels. They had absorbed the
  experience of earlier progressive anticolonial and proletarian struggles.</p>

  <p>They fully understood the objective tendencies of the bourgeoisie, the imperative
  need of capitalist monopolies to expand, their inability to solve their own
  contradictions. Above all they understood the contradiction between the collective
  character of production &mdash; that is of collective labor &mdash; and the individual private
  appropriation of the labor of others by the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>They understood that the one true ally in the world arena that could keep the wolf
  from the door was the world proletariat &mdash; which at that moment was especially strong
  and revolutionary in Western Europe. But they didn't neglect to proclaim an alliance of
  the working class with the mass of the oppressed peoples in what is now called the
  Third World. Lenin amended the fundamental slogan of communism to: "Workers of the
  world and <em>oppressed peoples,</em> unite." It was clearly and unmistakably aimed at
  the ruling classes in the imperialist countries.</p>

  <p>For those who doubt that such was the perspective of the architects of the Soviet
  state, it is only necessary to remind ourselves of some of Lenin's most important
  speeches. They contained the sternest warnings regarding the encirclement of the USSR
  and the danger to its very existence.</p>

  <p>Lenin said it again and again:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>In his Report of the Central Committee to the 8th Congress of the Party, March
    18, 1919: "We are living not merely in a state, but <em>in a system of states,</em>
    and it is inconceivable for the Soviet Republic to exist alongside of the imperialist
    states for any length of time. One or the other must triumph in the end."
    (<em>Collected Works,</em> vol. 29, p. 153)</li>

    <li>In a speech to the Moscow Soviet, April 23, 1918: "We are a revolutionary working
    class contingent that has advanced to the forefront, not because we are better than
    other workers, not because the Russian proletariat is superior to the working class
    of other countries, but solely because we were one of the most backward countries in
    the world. We shall achieve final victory only when we succeed at last in
    conclusively smashing international imperialism which relies on the tremendous
    strength of its equipment and discipline. But we shall achieve victory only together
    with all the workers of other countries of the whole world. ... Our backwardness has
    put us in the forefront, and we shall perish unless we are capable of holding out
    until we receive powerful support from workers who have risen in revolt in other
    countries." (Ibid., vol. 27, p. 233)</li>

    <li>In a report to the Moscow Conference of Factory Committees, July 23, 1918: "The
    Russian Revolution is only one of the contingents of the international socialist
    army, on the action of which the success and triumph of our revolution depends."
    (Ibid., vol. 27, p. 545)</li>

    <li>In a resolution he wrote for the 7th Congress of the Russian Communist Party,
    March 6, 1918: "The Congress considers the only reliable guarantee of consolidation
    of the socialist revolution that has been victorious in Russia to be its conversion
    into a world working class revolution." (Ibid., vol. 27, p. 119)</li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <p>These quotes from Lenin are in sharp contrast to Owen's naive conception of getting
  the bourgeoisie to cooperate and allow the building of socialism.</p>

  <p>Lenin's view was also, of course, diametrically opposite to the conceptions of
  Mikhail Gorbachev. Though Gorbachev came over 150 years after Owen, he appropriated the
  Owenist conception of winning the collaboration of the capitalists, even though by then
  they had degenerated into a regressive and utterly decadent social category.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev in his much-vaunted theses on a "new world order" and "universal human
  values" preached a reactionary utopianism that turned Owen upside down. After 150 years
  of bitter struggles against the working class, after the crushing of the Paris Commune,
  after innumerable imperialist interventions against the Soviet Union and every other
  country where the masses attempted in any way to alleviate imperialist oppression &mdash;
  from Guatemala to Cuba, Grenada and Nicaragua, from the Congo to Angola and Mozambique,
  from Korea and Vietnam to Afghanistan, from Iran to Egypt, Lebanon, Libya and Iraq &mdash;
  after decades of nuclear intimidation and finally Star Wars, Gorbachev preached harmony
  with the capitalists, as though it all depended on the good will of the oppressed. It
  was nothing less than treachery and a surrender to imperialism.</p>

  <p><strong>Isolation of first socialist revolution</strong></p>

  <p>The socialist revolution unexpectedly broke out first in Russia, not in an advanced
  capitalist country. The USSR was to a large extent an isolated phenomenon in a world
  still dominated by capitalism. Although it covered one-sixth of the earth's surface, it
  was surrounded by a world imperialist environment.</p>

  <p>The Bolsheviks had a revolutionary and scientific approach to building socialism but
  they were no more immune to the social environment, to the domination of monopoly
  capitalism on a world scale, than was New Harmony in its day.</p>

  <p>In attempting to analyze the developments that led to the counterrevolution in the
  USSR, the many discussions that took place in the Second International before the First
  World War on the prospects of proletarian revolution are of greatest interest. Jean
  Jaur√®s, the French socialist leader, had written about the problem of the isolated
  socialist state even before the turn of the century:</p>

  <blockquote>
    In the present condition of Europe, and insofar as the course of events can be
    foreseen, it is no longer possible to hope, unless one is blind, or to assert, unless
    one is a traitor, that socialism will be achieved in the advanced nations by peaceful
    means. The nation which first achieves socialism will see all the frenzied powers of
    reaction hurled against it at the same time. It will be lost if it is not itself
    prepared to seize a sword, to answer bullet with bullet so that the working class of
    other countries may have time to organize and rise in its turn. <small>(Quoted in
    <em>Stalin &mdash; A Critical Survey of Bolshevism</em><br />
    Boris Souvarine, New York: Octagon Books, 1972)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This problem engaged the attention of the opportunist elements in the Second
  International as well as of the revolutionaries. They drew divergent conclusions. The
  opportunists concluded from the Paris Commune that collaboration with the bourgeoisie
  was necessary. That led them to the ultimate treachery &mdash; support for the First World
  War. The revolutionists drew the essential lesson of the Commune from the writings of
  Marx that the working class could not lay hold of the ready-made machinery of the
  capitalist state, but had to smash it and erect a state of its own, of which the
  Commune was an embryo. Lenin elaborated on this in <em>State and Revolution.</em></p>

  <p>Throughout the period of the growth, flowering and development of social democracy
  in Europe, the issue of whether an isolated workers' state could long exist was the
  subject of continual discussion.</p>

  <p><strong>Lenin, the realist with a dream</strong></p>

  <p>A communist must dream, said Lenin. But he was no builder of castles in the air. He
  was a realist to the marrow of his bones and the most profound student of Marxism,
  which he applied to the conditions of old Russia.</p>

  <p>Here we find a difference between utopian socialism and scientific socialism. The
  utopians' impractical, imaginary schemes were based on the good will of the ruling
  class and the prospect of thriving in a stable, peaceful social system. But this system
  has since undergone two monstrous world wars, innumerable counterrevolutionary
  interventions, and genocidal attempts to crush any who dare rebel.</p>

  <p>One aspect of Soviet history was undoubtedly utopian; that was the period of War
  Communism. However, it was forced upon the regime by internal counterrevolution, civil
  war, and intervention. Under those conditions the Bolsheviks leaped over any
  intermediate forms and moved directly to an enforced kind of equality in which food was
  rationed, grain was requisitioned from the farmers, and the market was abolished.</p>

  <p>While it saved the revolution, it led to economic disaster, as the rebellion at
  Kronstadt showed. At the 10th Party Congress, what should have been a gathering of
  triumphant victory for socialism turned into something else amid a confused debate on
  how to organize the new Soviet republic. The economy was utterly devastated; production
  had reached its lowest point ever. A temporary retreat was necessary.</p>

  <p>As soon as peace returned, the Bolshevik government went back to the market for a
  limited time in order to rebuild the industries and the working class itself, which had
  been decimated in the armed struggles.</p>

  <p><strong>Objective and subjective conditions</strong></p>

  <p>Marx and his successors were able to see what was not clear to the utopians: that
  people "make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do
  not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly
  encountered, given and transmitted from the past." (<em>The Eighteenth Brumaire of
  Louis Bonaparte</em>).</p>

  <p>All the USSR's problems must be seen in this objective context. The revolutionaries
  could not make history out of their own materials but had to make do with the
  conditions that prevailed in Russia.</p>

  <p>First and foremost among these conditions was that the workers' state in the USSR
  only succeeded because of its alliance with the much more numerous peasantry. The
  alliance was correct, principled, and indispensable in the overthrow of czarism. But it
  presented an enormous problem. The proletariat as a class is supremely interested in
  the socialization of property and production, which the bourgeoisie has in fact already
  started. But the peasants are concerned with private property, their private plots. The
  alliance showed its difficulties right from the start of the revolution. How to keep
  the loyalty of the peasants?</p>

  <p>This led to the next problem. It was not a pure workers' state in the sense that the
  proletariat was a majority of the population or was able to organize a new social
  system on its own. The truth of the matter, as Lenin, Trotsky, Bukharin and Stalin all
  saw and agreed, is that it was necessary to rely to a large extent on the old czarist
  administrative apparatus &mdash; a bitter pill to swallow. This was true even in the
  military sphere. Former czarist officers were recruited, even though they had to be
  guarded by communist civilian cadre, the commissars.</p>

  <p>The Russian proletariat, truly one of the great wonders of the world in their
  class-consciousness and adherence to Marxism, could go through innumerable sacrifices,
  face famine and civil war, subversion, counterrevolution, as well as intervention. But
  the Bolsheviks had promised peace, and peace is what they most wanted and needed.
  Weariness was setting in.</p>

  <p>Relying upon elements of the old state apparatus in all fields of life held not only
  obvious dangers but a hidden one: These elements knew how to show eagerness and
  servility to the state, as in czarist times. The Communist Party, which they had
  previously scorned and feared &mdash; not to speak of imprisoned and banished &mdash; now could
  become a source of privilege if they showed support for the government and party.</p>

  <p>The question before the Bolsheviks was how to deal with these layers &mdash; the old
  bureaucracy, the officialdom, remnants of the old educated classes &mdash; who now sensing
  the victory of the revolution tried to find an easy entrance into it.</p>

  <p><strong>Bourgeoisie grows up inside USSR</strong></p>

  <p>Just as during the lengthy feudal period the bourgeoisie grew up in the crevices of
  feudal society, so in Soviet society the bourgeoisie accommodated itself to the
  workers' state and, after the death of Lenin, to the leaders. They fortified their
  position within the society, now and then offering a challenge of a minor character,
  until they had become strengthened and went from servility to domination.</p>

  <p>The few years of peace that began in the mid-1920s, a relatively stable period in
  the capitalist world, sowed illusions of incredible proportions in the USSR. The
  perspective on the world revolution was abandoned in what seemed like an endless period
  of coexistence.</p>

  <p>The period of stability strengthened the hold of bureaucracy and led to endless
  repression of both left and right. This quenched much of the revolutionary idealism,
  not just in society in general but above all among the mass of communists who bore the
  brunt of the indiscriminate repression.</p>

  <p>The rise of bureaucratism and the undemocratic crushing of party discussion and
  debate opened the door to bourgeois elements who were utterly indifferent to socialist
  ideology but willing to espouse it in order to ingratiate themselves. All this set in
  motion a train of developments that has finally led to the undoing of the party and the
  capture of the government and party apparatus by a social grouping hostile to
  communism. This inner corrosion was the Achilles heel, which, from a subjective point
  of view, strengthened the internal forces of capitalism and led to the great
  debacle.</p>

  <p>When the Gorbachevs, the Yakovlevs, the Yeltsins, the whole kit and kaboodle of the
  new reformers came out into the open in full view of the world at the 19th Party
  Conference in June 1988, the U.S. bourgeoisie gave them gavel-to-gavel coverage. It
  showed that the party had been captured by a social grouping hostile to socialism,
  anxious to propitiate the new bourgeoisie and accommodate itself peacefully with the
  imperialist oppressors.</p>

  <p><strong>IMF imposes neocolonialism</strong></p>

  <p>It is utterly incredible that today the republics of the USSR are in a
  neocolonialist position, having to beg for aid from the imperialists. How did they get
  that way? It couldn't happen without internal corrosion of both the party and its
  institutions. We may differ on just how this happened, but it is absolutely
  incontestable that inner decay sapped the proletariat's revolutionary strength and
  vigor.</p>

  <p>It is now reported (<em>New York Times,</em> Jan. 11, 1992) that after the recent
  disastrous increases in consumer prices had already begun, throwing the USSR into
  chaos, a team from the International Monetary Fund, "acting with the endorsement of the
  United States," actually went to Moscow to demand that the government of Russia take
  "drastic additional steps, chief among them a sharp increase in oil prices.</p>

  <p>"The IMF wants President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, where most of the
  commonwealth's oil is produced, to raise petroleum prices to 10 to 15 times their
  present level, and they have already quadrupled in the last week.</p>

  <p>"Such a rise would increase gasoline and heating-oil supplies by pricing them beyond
  the reach of many people &mdash; a measure not tried in the old Soviet Union."</p>

  <p>In other words, the IMF is now openly dictating economic policy to Russia and
  presumably the other republics. We won't refer to the so-called "commonwealth" &mdash; it is
  only a group of counterrevolutionaries who have seized the governmental apparatus. (To
  refer to them as the commonwealth concedes legitimacy to the counterrevolution, which
  was a usurpation of power.)</p>

  <p>What is the IMF? It is the concentrated financial power of the imperialist
  bourgeoisie of the whole world. It is the instrument by which imperialism has obtained
  economic and, in most cases, political domination over all the oppressed countries of
  the world.</p>

  <p>The IMF controls the financial levers of a given country, telling them how much to
  spend and how much to save. Most Third World countries as a result are deep in debt,
  and their debtor position worsens each year. If a country the size of the USSR, with
  its enormous natural and industrial resources, should become indebted to the tune of
  $65 billion and must borrow to pay interest on the debt, there can only be one
  explanation: The governing group has become completely subordinate to the will of the
  imperialist bankers. They in turn are working hand in glove with the U.S.
  government.</p>

  <p>The IMF was founded in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944. The U.S. sponsored it
  because it was the only country to come out of the Second World War virtually
  unscathed. The purpose was to stabilize the currencies of the imperialist allies.</p>

  <p>But instead it turned out to be the means to achieve hegemony within the imperialist
  camp and control the economies of the Third World. The IMF decides what economic
  programs, what social and even political legislation should be enacted. In order to get
  credit from the IMF or World Bank, the given country's books have to be inspected by
  staff officials from the bank or the IMF. They specify the conditions of the loan and
  "recommend" how the operations of the economic and financial system should be
  conducted.</p>

  <p>To think that the USSR should submit to such conditions in the name of educating its
  personnel on how to transform socialist projects into competitive, private entities! It
  is submitting to colonial subjugation. How else can it be explained?</p>

  <p>Of course, these plans have not yet been executed. But it is reported that $35
  billion worth of gold bullion has already been transferred out of the country, either
  to pay for imports, defray expenses or pay interest on loans. This in a country that
  before Gorbachev was considered the most credit-worthy in the world. Private banks
  competed with each other to tender loans to the USSR.</p>

  <p>We have written extensively on how the counterrevolution has not yet succeeded in
  destroying the social foundations of the USSR &mdash; the socialized properties and
  enterprises. But if this goes on for any length of time without resistance strong
  enough to oust the counterrevolutionary governing group, then, of course, the process
  of restoring capitalism will ultimately succeed.</p>

  <p><strong>Superficial democracy</strong></p>

  <p>With all the talk of democracy and freedom of choice and so on, were the people of
  the Soviet Union &mdash; the workers and peasants &mdash; ever given an opportunity to vote on
  the fundamental issue? Were they ever given a clear choice: to vote for either
  capitalism or socialism? Was it ever clearly stated that that's what the choice
  was?</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the masses were never given a direct political choice between
  capitalism and socialism. That was never presented to them. The capitalist reforms were
  smuggled in on glittering promises of plenty instead of scarcity. The matter of raising
  prices was never submitted to a referendum. Neither was the dissolution of the Soviet
  Union. Some of the republics voted for independence, but they did not disaffiliate from
  the USSR.</p>

  <p>The USSR was broken up not by the will of the masses but by unscrupulous renegade
  socialists.</p>

  <p>This does not exhaust the problem. It does not answer all the questions, nor can
  that be done at this time.</p>

  <p>It is necessary first to thoroughly examine the objective situation in order to
  understand the inner regression, the rise of bureaucratism, the erosion of
  revolutionary spirit, repression, the forced character of collectivization, the
  decimation of both left and right tendencies in the party.</p>

  <p><strong>The cold war and capitalist restructuring</strong></p>

  <p>During the long decades of the cold war, under the military and economic pressure of
  imperialism, the leaders of the USSR felt the urgency to expand its geopolitical
  influence. While this strengthened the USSR on the one hand, it weakened it
  economically. It contracted to do more in its external affairs &mdash; or gave the
  appearance that it did. In reality it could not sustain it.</p>

  <p>Seen in retrospect, launching Sputnik in 1957 was a tremendous advance in science
  that demonstrated the prowess and viability of a planned economy and its superiority
  over capitalism. But at the same time it was an enormous diversion of the USSR's
  resources from the consumer sector to the military-industrial complex. It impeded
  orderly development and the indispensable balance between agriculture and industry.</p>

  <p>It also enhanced the political influence of the upper layers, especially those
  engaged in higher technology, at the expense of the proletariat and lower echelons. It
  reinforced social inequality.</p>

  <p>While there are broad historic forces that must be overcome to build socialism in a
  Third World country, there are also immediate reasons why the counterrevolution
  captured the governing apparatus in the USSR. The most important one was the leap taken
  by capitalist development in the U.S. &mdash; the development of the
  scientific-technological revolution.</p>

  <p>Beginning in the late 1970s, the U.S. launched an extremely intensive restructuring
  of capitalist industry. Its essence was a most onerous anti-labor offensive that rivals
  the struggles of the 19th century. It all began with the Carter administration and has
  continued through three successive terms of Reagan and Bush. (See <a href=
  "../hightech/index.html"><em>High Tech, Low Pay,</em></a> by Sam Marcy, WW Publishers,
  1986)</p>

  <p>Restructuring became a world phenomenon. It swept the USSR into a competitive race
  that took an enormous toll on the mass of the population, coming as it did on top of
  the burdens of the military-nuclear challenge by U.S. imperialism. The planned economy
  has a certain pace precisely because it is based on planning. It can't suddenly change
  its tempo in response to external pressures. That disrupts the planning. The leadership
  in particular has to be on guard and awake to all the possibilities of imperialist
  intrigue, from the military challenge to such matters as the development of the
  computer revolution. Unfortunately, the USSR got a very late start in the computer
  revolution and underestimated its significance. Moreover, the imperialists maintained a
  tight blockade that kept out high technology, even what other countries routinely
  pirate.</p>

  <p>The USSR leadership proved unequal to the task of maintaining the social system in
  the light of this furious offensive, which eventually undermined the position of the
  workers.</p>

  <p><strong>Red Flag will rise again</strong></p>

  <p>The counterrevolution has hauled down the Red Flag, the flag of the oppressed, of
  the workers. Even in ancient times, the Red Flag was the emblem of the slave
  rebellions. It symbolized the red blood that flows in the veins of all humanity, with
  no distinction as to race or nationality, sex or social position.</p>

  <p>How fitting that the Yeltsins have raised the blue flag. For centuries it was the
  flag of oppression, representing the "blue blood" that is supposed to distinguish
  aristocrats from the common folk.</p>

  <p>The Red Flag has been taken down many, many times before, only to be hoisted again.
  Why? Because it is the flag of the oppressed, the flag of those deprived of their
  freedom, their nationality, their labor, who are forced into slavery and eventually
  into rebellion. We see it raised now by the crowds protesting in Red Square. It will be
  raised again in a thousand places as the workers' struggle for socialist emancipation
  revives across the breadth of the Soviet Union.</p>
