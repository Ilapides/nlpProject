  <h5>Soviet Socialism: Utopian or Scientific [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>This work first appeared in the Jan. 30, 1992, issue of Workers World newspaper at a
  time when world imperialism was celebrating the fragmenting of the USSR and the
  economic inroads being made by monopoly capital.</p>

  <p>Sam Marcy puts the problems of the socialist revolution in the Soviet Union in their
  historical context and in relation to developments in the worldwide struggle of the
  working class and the oppressed nations.</p>

  <p>As an organizer and political leader, Marcy has been critically analyzing the
  development of socialism in the Soviet Union for 60 years. He has been an unwavering
  supporter of socialist construction and defender of the gains of the working class.
  Today, he has more than 20 titles in print on the worldwide struggle to end oppression
  and exploitation and build socialism. His works have been reprinted on every
  continent.</p>

  <p>Marcy and Workers World were the first to put forward a critical Marxist analysis of
  the developments in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev. As early as 1987, Marcy was
  warning of the dangers posed by capitalist and imperialist penetration of the Soviet
  Union. He talked of the catastrophe facing the Soviet workers and national minorities
  if the policy of perestroika were followed to its logical end &mdash; capitalist
  counterrevolution. Marcy concluded that the only way forward for Soviet socialism was
  through a more egalitarian socialist planning that genuinely involved the mass of
  Soviet workers and gave special consideration to the participation of the many
  nationalities.</p>

  <p>Marcy offers a class viewpoint in the tradition of Marx, Engels and Lenin. For
  readers interested in pursuing this subject, the first four years of Gorbachev are
  thoroughly examined in Marcy's 400 &mdash; page book, <a href=
  "../perestroika/index.html"><em>Perestroika, A Marxist Critique.</em></a> In the words
  of Donald Fiene, Professor of Russian Studies at the University of Tennessee, "Sam
  Marcy exhibits a comprehensive and detailed understanding of the complex changes taking
  place in the Soviet Union."</p>

  <h3 class="c1">Dedication</h3>

  <p>This pamphlet is dedicated to Dorothy Ballan &mdash; beloved wife, comrade, fighter
