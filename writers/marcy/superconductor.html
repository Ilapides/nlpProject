  <h1>The Superconductor Revolution &mdash; Its Impact on Workers and Wages</h1>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>The following article by Sam Marcy on "The Superconductor Revolution &mdash; Its
  Impact on Workers and Wages" appeared in Workers World (WW) newspaper on April 30,
  1987.</p>

  <p>The scientific-technological restructuring sweeping capitalist industry at the
  present time was first examined by Sam Marcy in "The Changed Character of the Working
  Class" (WW, October 25, 1984). A further study of this dramatic reorganization of
  industry and its resulting dislocation, mass layoffs and shift to lower-paying jobs was
  developed in his book <a href="hightech/index.html"><em>High Tech, Low Pay,</em></a>
  published in May 1986.</p>

  <p>The excitement in scientific and business circles all over the world that greets
  each new breakthrough in superconductors demonstrates that this current trend will
  vastly intensify. New plants, facilities, processes and even whole new industries in
  energy, transportation and communications are projected.</p>

  <p>In the face of such enormous change, those most affected &mdash; the producers, the
  workers &mdash; need an understanding of the forces at work and their future impact on
  wages and working conditions. This is crucial in order for the workers to safeguard
  their class interests, raise their own demands and organize a fightback strategy.</p>

  <p>In reading this present article on superconductors it is important to restate the
  perspective raised by Sam Marcy in <em>High Tech, Low Pay:</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    The scientific-technological revolution has become such an enormous economic factor
    that it has changed the social composition of the U.S. working class.

    <p>The basic content of the change has been a massive general shift of the workers
    away from relatively high-skilled, high-paid jobs into lower-skilled, lower-paid
    service jobs.</p>

    <p>Because of this shift, the social weight of the lower-skilled, lower-paid workers,
    made up mostly of Black and Latin people and women, has become preponderant in the
    general workforce of the U.S.</p>

    <p>Instead of raising the level of Black, Latin women and other oppressed workers in
    capitalist society to that of the higher-paid more privileged, so-called aristocratic
    sector of workers the scientific-technological revolution is mercilessly and
    ruthlessly leveling down and demolishing the higher social stratum in the working
    class and reducing it to the level of the lower paid.</p>

    <p>While the apologists for the ruling class are celebrating this new condition of
    the working class, they stop short at drawing the deeper social and political
    significance it has for the process of the newly emerging social composition of the
    working class. The growing demolition of vast sections of highly paid workers and
    their sinking to the level of the more oppressed sections spells out a new
    constellation of internal forces in the working class. It will, for one thing,
    fundamentally alter the relationship between Black and white workers.</p>

    <p>This developing relationship bodes ill for capitalist apologists because it
    discloses a new material basis for classwide solidarity and even a revolutionary
    potential for the working class. The new composition of the working class will give
    it a more homogeneous character and limit greatly the racist, hierarchical
    stratification upon which the ruling class has been able to thrive and which it has
    cultivated and promoted all these years.</p>

    <p>It will inevitably shift the political balance away from the more privileged
    layers of the working class in favor of the hitherto underprivileged, unrepresented
    and more scattered oppressed workers. The internal political relations between the
    different strata of the working class will become more harmonized on the level of
    working class politics. This new trend in the working class goes contrary to the
    historical tendency of capitalist development in the past.</p>

    <p>The scientific-technological revolution is a truly global phenomenon and should
    not be assessed solely on the basis of its national manifestation in the U.S. Its
    influence stretches from one end of the globe to the other. Its effects can be felt
    in Tokyo and Sweden, in France and Mexico, all over the globe.</p>

    <p>It is a phenomenon that cannot be reversed. Those who bemoan its existence today
    must look to the future, not to a return to the past, which in any case is
    impossible.</p>

    <p>The devastating effects of monopoly capitalism's latest assault will, after trials
    and errors, inevitably give birth to an upsurge in the movement of the working class
    and oppressed peoples &mdash; and one which has incalculable potential for
    progressive and revolutionary working class solidarity.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h1>The Superconductor Revolution</h1>

  <p>The superconductor revolution is still in the making. However, extraordinary
  breakthroughs have been made which demonstrate that this revolution is well on its
  way.</p>

  <p>What are superconductors? They are materials which, when cooled sufficiently, carry
  electricity with no loss of energy. That's because they have no electrical
  resistance.</p>

  <p>When an electric current is sent into a conduction loop made of conventional copper
  wire, it decays quickly. However, if superconducting material is used, the current will
  circulate indefinitely even after the power is turned off.</p>

  <p>Until now, extremely cold temperatures (from minus 430 F to minus 459 F or absolute
  zero) were required to trigger superconductivity in certain materials.
  Superconductivity could be achieved by packing the material in liquid helium, but this
  was far too costly to be practical.</p>

  <p>Just in the last year, materials have been discovered that will become
  superconductors at warmer temperatures. Instead of having to cool a substance to near
  absolute zero, the point at which electrical resistance disappeared was raised to minus
  406 F in January 1986, minus 284 F, in February 1987 and as high as minus 28 F by this
  March. Researchers now believe that superconductivity at room temperature is not
  inconceivable.</p>

  <p><strong>'Will change structure of society'</strong></p>

  <p>These discoveries are so profound in their potential application that their
  influence may exceed that of the transistor revolution. Dr. C.W. Chu, a scientist at
  the University of Houston who has made significant contributions to the recent
  superconductor discoveries, has said they will involve "a major change in the
  infrastructure of our society."</p>

  <p>All this is bound to accelerate the restructuring of U.S. industry and exert a most
  powerful impact on the condition of the working class.</p>

  <p>Among the many projected uses of superconductors is their application to the
  refining of petroleum and processing of chemicals and metals. While this has yet to
  move out of the laboratory and onto the factory floor, it is expected to revolutionize
  the refining industries.</p>

  <p>New refining processes using superconductors promise to cut costs and boost profits.
  But cutting costs and raising profits, as we have learned through bitter experience in
  these last six years of the scientific technological revolution and anti-labor drive,
  invariably mean layoffs, cutbacks and plant closings.</p>

  <p><strong>Smaller motors, fewer workers</strong></p>

  <p>Superconductors should also make it possible to reduce electric motors to perhaps a
  tenth of their current size, according to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (March 30).
  This will make electric autos more feasible for big cities. However, one can well
  imagine how this will reduce the workforce in plants where electric motors are
  produced. And, given the restructuring that is already taking place in the auto
  industry toward robotization and fewer workers, won't this trend continue with the new
  technology?</p>

  <p>It will now be possible to build superfast trains that use electromagnetism to
  travel at the speed of an airplane suspended above the rails on a cushion of air. The
  Japanese industrialists have produced such a train already, using earlier technology.
  The new discoveries make such forms of transportation all the more feasible.</p>

  <p>What is anticipated from all this is a revolution in the way electricity will be
  generated, transmitted and stored. If the excitement surrounding these developments is
  any gauge of their significance, then the meeting of the American Physical Society held
  in New York on March 18 showed how truly revolutionary they are.</p>

  <p>Normally the APS meeting is conservative, dignified, even staid. This time it was
  uproarious. Instead of the 1,200 participants who were expected to fill the New York
  Hilton auditorium, there were almost 3,500. Hundreds stood in the aisles while others
  watched the proceedings on closed-circuit TV in the halls and exhibit rooms.</p>

  <p>It was a veritable "Woodstock of physics," as a <em>New York Times</em> writer
  called it, so great was their jubilation on hearing the papers that recounted scores of
  discoveries regarding the new superconductor revolution. The session lasted until 3
  a.m.</p>

  <p><strong>International competition spurs discoveries</strong></p>

  <p>While some say it may take years to realize the potential of the superconductor
  revolution, others believe the distance from the laboratory to the factory floor may be
  considerably shortened. The reason for this lies in factors which usually were not that
  significant in earlier periods.</p>

  <p>Superconductivity is not a discovery which is the property of a single individual
  corporation or government to the exclusion of others. It involves scientific
  achievements and work on at least three continents Hundreds of scientists have been
  working on this problem in universities and corporations in the United States, Japan
  and other capitalist countries as well as in China. It is also very likely that similar
  work is going on in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.</p>

  <p>What must be remembered in connection with all this and which concerns the working
  class most of all, is that it takes place at a time of the vast restructuring of
  industry on a global basis. There is no question that this will take on even swifter
  momentum once the practical use of superconductors is perfected.</p>

  <p>The crucial social question for workers in the capitalist countries is whether the
  industrialists who own the plants affected by this new technology will try to embark
  upon the same kind of restructuring already carried out by the auto barons and the
  steel magnates and which has caused so much dismantling of plants.</p>

  <p>The ominous effects which have followed restructuring may also follow the
  introduction of superconductors on a mass scale. The workers must be prepared for the
  possibility that once the momentum of the superconductor revolution takes hold
  restructuring may develop at an even swifter pace.</p>

  <p><strong>More significant than transistor</strong></p>

  <p>The superconductor revolution is bound to be at least as significant as the
  invention of the transistor, which was developed by Bell Laboratories of AT&amp;T. The
  difference, however, is that when Bell Labs developed the transistor, the company
  immediately took out a patent on it and others who wished to produce or sell it had to
  obtain a license from AT&amp;T.</p>

  <p>It must be noted that in earlier periods, whenever an invention or discovery was
  made by an individual or single corporation, it was usually desirable to keep it under
  lock and key for a considerable period. This allowed the company to take full advantage
  of the older technology it possessed until that became at least relatively obsolescent.
  And at the same time the company was able to garner in the advantages of the higher
  price of the older product.</p>

  <p>Just recently, for example, a new food-packaging technology was announced which it
  is claimed will keep meat, poultry, produce and other perishable foods fresh for as
  long as a year <strong>without refrigeration.</strong> The General Foods Corporation
  has applied for a patent on this new technology but is keeping it under lock and key
  for now, getting whatever price advantage it can from the older technology.</p>

  <p>Obtaining patents and having exclusive rights to an invention or discovery tends
  toward monopoly, on account of its exclusive control. However, it should be pointed out
  that in the past this did maintain relative stability in the workforce, notwithstanding
  the capitalist cycle of development and its recurring recessions with their devastating
  economic effects on the workers.</p>

  <p>In the present phase of the scientific-technological revolution, the period of
  telecommunications and satellites, many of the discoveries and inventions take place
  almost simultaneously on a world scale. Secrecy around a very significant development
  in science and technology is no longer as easy as it was in an earlier period.</p>

  <p>This has been shown in the development of computers and electronics, the field of
  atomic energy and the current phase of the struggle for the domination of outer
  space.</p>

  <p>Scientists in laboratories in Japan, West Germany, Holland, Switzerland and the
  socialist countries are all working on space-related problems at the same time. This
  puts pressure on the corporations to bring whatever products are derived therefrom to
  the market faster than their competitors. They call these products fallout or
  by-products of the race in outer space.</p>

  <p>In earlier times it was only the product that became relatively obsolescent in
  record time. Now it is the plant and equipment themselves that become obsolescent
  before full use can be made of them. This is due entirely to the fierceness of the
  international competition among the leading imperialist powers, as witness the growing
  bitterness between the U.S. and Japan over imports.</p>

  <p><strong>Pressure to restructure industry</strong></p>

  <p>The superconductor revolution will result in greater pressure to more speedily
  restructure U.S. industry. For one thing it involves many of the very same giant
  companies &mdash; IBM, AT&amp;T, GE, Westinghouse as well as others &mdash; that have
  led the restructuring in the U.S. Most of the leading universities are also directly
  involved in the effort.</p>

  <p>The Pentagon is also directly involved. An astrophysicist, James A. Jonson, heads
  the Office of Innovative Science and Technology, an arm of the Pentagon's Strategic
  Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO). He has already lined up a sufficient number of
  scientists from universities and is busily forming his own consortium.</p>

  <p>The Pentagon's objective is of course related to a speedup of missile development.
  It intends for example to utilize superconductivity to achieve smaller and more
  accurate missiles. Otherwise the SDIO would not have been so eager to get into this new
  field so quickly.</p>

  <p>In the period when the transistor was invented, the pressure to restructure industry
  was not as intense as it is today. At that time competition with Japan and the other
  imperialist countries was still on a relatively low level.</p>

  <p>But now economic competition has reached the stage where the U.S. has felt forced to
  invoke tariffs against Japanese products, which it hadn't done since the Second World
  War. The competition with regard to superconductors is even keener than that over
  microcomputers, microchips, televisions or other electronic products.</p>

  <p>The U.S. and Japan seem to have been running neck and neck to achieve a breakthrough
  in superconductivity. The U.S. barely nosed out Tokyo when on Feb. 15 the University of
  Houston announced it had pushed the limit of superconductivity to above the minus 284
  F, degree point.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it must be remembered that Japan already has a train that uses
  superconductivity to travel over 250 miles an hour five inches above the track. Japan
  is also leading in industrial ceramics which will certainly help to develop ceramic
  superconductors. All this is sure to heighten the pressure here to cut costs in order
  to compete.</p>

  <p><strong>Lower wages are end result</strong></p>

  <p>Ultimately the pressure will be transmitted to the working class, as reducing the
  cost of a unit of labor time is the essence of the whole struggle.</p>

  <p>As we noted in our book <a href="hightech/index.html"><em>High Tech, Low
  Pay,</em></a> the Japanese railroad workers have been involved in a long struggle over
  the restructuring of Japanese railroads. The superfast trains together with the
  restructuring of Japanese industries would devastate their wage level and reduce the
  workforce.</p>

  <p>If, however, these developments are still so many years away, as some say, is there
  really any reason to worry about them now?</p>

  <p>The distance between laboratory and factory floor may be shortened very quickly,
  depending upon how many problems which have not yet fully emerged can be resolved.</p>

  <p>What has to be stressed is the breakneck speed at which superconductivity is being
  developed, spurred on by competition on three continents involving huge corporations
  universities and governments.</p>

  <p>As we noted, AT&amp;T, IBM, Westinghouse and GE are most intimately involved at the
  present time and these are the very multi-nationals that are engaged in intense
  restructuring of plant and equipment which means tremendous layoffs because the new
  technology requires a smaller workforce. Their plans with respect to superconductivity
  are kept secret from the workers, the public at large and in particular the unions that
  protect the interests of the workers.</p>

  <p>The heads of the research departments of these giant corporations who work with the
  banks for financing are looking at the superconductor revolution in the light of their
  present restructuring of industry. Already there is talk of a government and industry
  conference regarding this. There is already work being done of a legislative character
  that is making its way through Congress and about which little is known.</p>

  <p>But what is known, and it concerns the working class very profoundly, is that there
  is no sign that either the government or the giant corporations are attempting to
  consult with either the public or the unions representing the workers.</p>

  <p>When the transistor was developed in the 1940s the labor movement was very strong,
  yet the union leadership took no interest in the developing scientific-technological
  revolution. Even now when the labor movement has been ravaged by the restructuring, the
  tremendous layoffs and the anti-labor offensive the leadership is woefully late in
  giving this the necessary attention.</p>

  <p>This new technological revolution involving superconductors portends vast changes
  which could do even more havoc in disintegrating the influence of organized labor and
  the public in general.</p>

  <p>The heads of the large corporations who are privy to the research and development of
  superconductors have a monopoly of knowledge. They leave open no possibility for the
  working class as a force to have a say in the matter; the workers are to be driven like
  cattle from one industry to another.</p>

  <p><strong>What workers must do</strong></p>

  <p>Resistance of a most massive character must be developed and begun in a timely way.
  Some steps can be taken almost immediately.</p>

  <p>The AFL-CIO and the unions most directly involved with the giant corporations must
  demand an impact study of the superconductor revolution to be financed by the
  government, the giant corporations and the universities involved. But the working class
  through its organizations, especially trade unions and community groups (really the
  bulk of the population of the U.S.), must conduct the impact study, which would ask,
  how does all this affect the workers?</p>

  <p>It took many years for the progressive environmental organizations to finally make
  impact studies a part of the struggle against the hazards in industry. But compared to
  those hazards, the social effect of massive layoffs and plant closings brought on
  through the introduction of massive new technology can be just as disastrous, if not
  more so.</p>

  <p>No introduction of these new technologies should be permitted without a study being
  conducted and approved by the communities and unions that are directly involved. After
  sufficient public notice has been given, extensive hearings must be held by all
  workers' organizations and including the communities, especially oppressed communities,
  almost all of whom have a direct or indirect interest in the outcome.</p>

  <p>The overall objective must be to attain such massive strength of organization as to
  be able to insist upon a veto over the introduction of any new scientific-technological
  systems in industry if they are deemed harmful to the workers and the community.</p>

  <p>In the early days of capitalist development, the economists who praised the system
  claimed that each new advance in technology would bring more order and security into
  social life. But as capitalism has expanded, and particularly since entering the
  monopoly stage, the profound new discoveries like atomic energy, the penetration of
  outer space and the invention of computers and electronics have introduced greater
  instability and disorder.</p>

  <p>Never has the working class been more afraid of the future. The great scientific
  discoveries of this age which could have such beneficial potential, are turned into
  frightful hazards which threaten their jobs and even life itself.</p>

  <p>In the contemporary bourgeois world, technology comes into being as capital. Its
  purpose is to enhance the exploitation of labor and the amassing of profit.</p>

  <p>As long as technology is the product of this social relation, it will cause havoc
  for the working class. Technology will become the instrument of true human development
  only when it has been transformed from private capital into the socially owned means of
  production.</p>
