  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: An open letter to Boris Yeltsin (June 27,
  1991)</title>

<body>
  <h1>An open letter to Boris Yeltsin</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (June 27, 1991)</h5>

  <p>Dear Boris Yeltsin:</p>

  <p>You, the president of the Russian Federation, have come to the U.S. on June 18. This
  week marks the 50th anniversary of the launching of Hitler's infamous military invasion
  of the USSR on June 21, 1941.</p>

  <p>That event and the subsequent defeat of the Nazi armies by the army and people of
  the USSR had enormous significance. So it seems strange to me that there are few if any
  commemorative articles or analyses. These would ordinarily flow like water from the
  many bourgeois academics in the U.S. Yet it is being passed over almost in silence.</p>

  <p>The Nazis' treacherous act must have come as a big surprise to Stalin as well as to
  his close supporters in the Politburo and Central Committee. As for you, I fear that
  your current visit to the U.S. will culminate in a somewhat similar surprise.</p>

  <p>Stalin thought he had outmaneuvered the Western imperialist democracies by making a
  nonaggression pact with Germany. He knew well that the Western capitalist powers were
  using the Munich Pact they made with Hitler to direct his aggressions toward the USSR.
  Actually, the Western imperialist democracies were in collusion with the Nazis at that
  point.</p>

  <p>But Stalin thought the nonaggression pact with Germany was a tremendous, brilliant
  coup that would stave off an imperialist attack against the USSR for a long time. He
  thought that perhaps the imperialists would fight among themselves and the USSR would,
  at least for a period, live in splendid isolation.</p>

  <p>The USSR would supply Germany with much-needed raw materials, grain and other
  agricultural products. Germany would supply the USSR with much-needed industrial
  equipment. Years earlier, even the Bolsheviks had counted on that happening once
  Germany became a workers' republic.</p>

  <h4>Imperialist treachery</h4>

  <p>Boris Yeltsin, you should know that when the Nazi attack against the USSR began,
  there was glee &mdash; real joy &mdash; in very significant sections of the U.S. ruling
  class. No less than the future president of the United States, Harry S. Truman,
  publicly said, "If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia and if Russia
  is winning we ought to help Germany and that way let them kill as many as
  possible...."</p>

  <p>The New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune, two significant ruling class organs
  of mass circulation at that time, applauded this line of thinking. Admiral William
  Harrison Standley and his naval attache, who were sent on a mission to Moscow by
  Averill Harriman, had conflicting views on the progress of the war. One hoped for a
  Nazi victory and the other was hesitatingly for the USSR.</p>

  <p>It was only after the Japanese imperialists attacked Pearl Harbor and entered the
  war on the side of the Nazis that things changed. All this you should know very
  well.</p>

  <p>You and your colleagues, along with Gorbachev, Ryzhkov and others, have been in a
  race to get to Washington hoping for a similar rapprochement with the U.S. You've been
  falling all over each other in your indecent haste to get the ear of the bankers and
  high government officials, including Bush and his aides.</p>

  <p>Lately there's an endless stream of Soviet delegations to the U.S. and U.S.
  delegations to the USSR. All have the supposed objective of quickly remedying the
  disastrous economic situation in the USSR on the basis of what amounts to a restoration
  of capitalism.</p>

  <p>Before you face a deluge of reporters and dignitaries from the State Department and
  elsewhere, you should sit down in your hotel room and read several items that will give
  you a better view of what you are facing.</p>

  <h4>Crisis of U.S. capitalism</h4>

  <p>The first is a significant story on the front page of the Wall Street Journal of
  June 17. Its headline is "U.S. living conditions are slipping, and were even before
  recession. Taking account of inflation and taxes, people find they have less to
  spend."</p>

  <p>The writer notes, "As local taxes mount and public services decline, people in such
  strapped communities as New York are well aware that their living standards are
  slipping. So are the growing ranks of those left jobless by the recession. But are U.S.
  living standards overall beginning to erode? It appears so. The erosion, moreover,
  predates the recession."</p>

  <p>This admission &mdash; from one of the most important organs of high finance and
  industry &mdash; should be an eye-opener to anyone in the USSR who believes that the
  streets of the U.S. are paved with gold, and that it is only necessary to cement good
  friendly relations with the U.S. government for the bankers and industrialists to open
  their purses and demonstrate their largess.</p>

  <p>Boris Yeltsin, you and all your colleagues, including Gorbachev, have been peddling
  this nonsense. It is bound to boomerang.</p>

  <p>There is another article, this one in the New York Times of June 16, which is more
  relevant to your current mission. You should read it. It very nearly projects a
  collapse of the whole U.S. banking system.</p>

  <p>The Times article shows that the bankruptcy of hundreds of savings and loan banks in
  the United States is beginning to affect the huge multinational banks. The entire
  banking system is in danger of a catastrophic financial crash like the one capitalism
  experienced in the 1930s.</p>

  <p>You are scheduled to speak at New York University, the biggest private university in
  the country. You ought to notice that today students in the U.S. can't find any free
  universities &mdash; unlike you, who got a free education from elementary school
  through university and were assigned a job thereafter.</p>

  <p>One hundred years ago, a free university system was established in New York City.
  Today students there have to pay a very substantial part of their income for their
  education.</p>

  <p>Two years ago CUNY students went out on strike against a big tuition hike. But the
  government won, and thousands of students couldn't afford to come back. This year, just
  a few weeks before you arrived, the students once again went out on strike because of
  another increase. They occupied many of the buildings; some still face criminal trial
  for their action.</p>

  <p>Boris Yeltsin, you should take note of this. You got your education free in a
  workers' state.</p>

  <p>If you can find the time you should also notice the poverty and homelessness in
  every major city of the United States. Every city of any size is cutting back on
  health, sanitation and social services because of the financial crisis the great cities
  of the U.S. face.</p>

  <p>I could go on and on. But you are more concerned with what you can accomplish by way
  of making the big deal. You want to be the one to rescue the USSR from its current
  economic crisis. You want to establish a relationship with the U.S. in which the USSR
  will become an integral part of the "new world order" and peace and cooperation will
  reign supreme.</p>

  <h4>The U.S., Russia and Solzhenitsyn</h4>

  <p>So, Boris Yeltsin, I would direct your attention to two more reading items. One is
  an article in the New York Times on May 15 about Robert Gates, President Bush's nominee
  to be chief of the CIA. The Times article refers to a 1983 speech in which Gates
  asserted that the enemy is not only the USSR, but Russia, too.</p>

  <p>Said Gates: "The threat posed by the Soviet Union &mdash; by Russia &mdash; is the
  lineal descendant of the same threat Western civilizations have faced for three and a
  half thousand years: it is the threat posed by despotisms against the more or less
  steadily developing concept that the highest goal of the state is to protect and foster
  the creative capabilities and the liberties of the individual."</p>

  <p>Now, Gates is no young eager beaver coming to the CIA with a new idea. He's an
  old-timer within the inner circle of the Reagan/Bush capitalist administration. He
  reflects a viewpoint in U.S. ruling circles. His aim is not merely to undo the USSR as
  a socialist state, but to undo the USSR altogether &mdash; including above all the
  Russian Federation of which you are the president. It would be wise for you to take him
  seriously, lest you suffer the same kind of surprise Stalin did when the Nazis opened
  up their cruel and unprovoked aggression against the USSR.</p>

  <p>Here it would be wise to look over another document. The writer Alexander
  Solzhenitsyn wrote a letter to the Politburo in the early 1970s. At that time the USSR
  and China were involved in military skirmishes with a dangerous potential of turning
  into an all-out war.</p>

  <p>Solzhenitsyn wrote a letter advising the Soviet leadership to abandon the struggle
  for communism and help construct a new model state based on the old czarist model.
  Why?</p>

  <p>As all the world knows, he is most viciously anti-communist and rabidly
  anti-democratic. He differs from Sakharov, for instance, who was pro-Western.
  Solzhenitsyn is strictly oriented toward Russia. He hearkens back to the days of the
  czarist autocracy. Solzhenitsyn sees Western bourgeois values as in conflict with his
  feudal moral concepts.</p>

  <p>But he is not given to exercises in futility. He had another matter in mind with his
  letter.</p>

  <p>As an ultra-nationalist, he foresaw the possibility of an all-out war between China
  and the USSR. While he didn't say it in his letter, he was most concerned that the U.S.
  would be only too glad if the two giant socialist countries got into this kind of
  fratricidal struggle. Then the U.S. with its military machine could move in on the
  USSR, dismember it, and use it as a base from which to establish a new
  military-industrial complex hemming in China and threatening it with extinction.</p>

  <p>You ought to know also that Walter Lippman, the renowned foreign policy commentator
  who was considered an eminent spokesperson for a liberal U.S. foreign policy, publicly
  suggested that China was too big and should be divided.</p>

  <h4>Swallowing the capitalist line</h4>

  <p>This is what the Bush administration really entertains: dismember the USSR and, for
  the next period, hem in, contain and if necessary disarm China. This is the new world
  order. The real one &mdash; not the figment of imagination you, Gorbachev and the
  others are cultivating. You have embraced a transformation of the USSR into capitalism
  because it is supposed to bring prosperity, peace and cooperation with the imperialist
  powers.</p>

  <p>With respect to Solzhenitsyn, in the early stages of his career when he was still a
  prisoner in the USSR, the U.S. grabbed onto him as a literary luminary who could be
  useful in the ideological struggle against the USSR. He would bolster the image of the
  U.S. as the democratic proponent of a new world order. But they soon got disillusioned
  with him.</p>

  <p>Hedrick Smith, one of the better-known students of the USSR, conducted extensive
  interviews with Solzhenitsyn for his book <em>The Russians</em> and came to the
  conclusion that Solzhenitsyn was anti-American. Solzhenitsyn understood that the U.S.
  was no different than the other rapacious capitalist powers; he didn't want to lead a
  crusade for U.S. imperialism. He wanted to find a way to bring back the old czarist
  system and compete with the U.S. rather than cooperate with it in the new world
  order.</p>

  <p>It is no accident that Solzhenitsyn, who now lives in seclusion on a farm in
  Vermont, has time and again refused invitations to go back to the USSR. That is because
  he realizes that you and your group are transitional figures, as is Gorbachev. He is
  from another school of thought, however reactionary-utopian it may be. But he is
  certainly on to the wiles of U.S. imperialism. And he lent himself to them only as long
  as it served his interests.</p>

  <p>Boris Yeltsin, you and your fellow collaborators, including Gorbachev, Ryzhkov and
  the others, have swallowed the U.S. imperialist bait, hook, line and sinker. There is
  not the vaguest hint that any one of you understands the real objectives of U.S.
  imperialism or the situation in which you find yourselves. You are living in a totally
  imaginary world that can only lead to the kind of disastrous surprise Stalin got when
  the Hitlerites launched Operation Barbarossa.</p>

  <h4>A bumbling counterrevolutionary</h4>

  <p>The way you have all been conducting yourselves, especially in the last three or
  four years, is an embarrassment to a communist like myself who has carefully observed
  developments in the USSR for over half a century. Some of the things you do are
  incredible. You fumble and bumble and make the kind of stupid errors that can only be
  grist to the mill of all the imperialist powers.</p>

  <p>Take yourself for instance, Boris Yeltsin. When the Russian parliament was about to
  meet a few months ago, you panicked in fear that you would be ousted from your
  position. So you hurriedly demagogued your way into rousing all the bourgeois elements
  in Moscow to hold a demonstration that was obviously calculated to intimidate the
  deputies.</p>

  <p>You certainly knew that most of the deputies were ex-Communist Party members; others
  were trained and cultivated by the CP. The fact of the matter is that the government
  apparatus, beginning with the smallest soviet all the way up to and including the
  Congress of Soviet Deputies, is still mostly Communist or ex-Communist. Only a narrow
  grouping is really bourgeois in the sense that they want a restoration of capitalism or
  even of the old czarist regime, which is ridiculous. At most, the espoused nationalists
  got 6% of the vote; most of that is just rotten trash. There has still not been a
  spontaneous upsurge of bourgeois elements in the sociological sense.</p>

  <p>Why all the nervousness, the maneuvers, and finally an attempt to intimidate the
  Russian parliament? It's fear, Boris Yeltsin.</p>

  <p>You are afraid of the masses themselves, afraid of the unknown in what you've
  embarked upon, afraid that you are building a house of cards. You fear that you have
  embarked on a course that by this time you must intuitively know is impractical and
  leads nowhere.</p>

  <p>After trials and tribulations, after sufferings, economic and social catastrophe,
  the masses will again rise to the occasion. They will call you all to account for your
  disastrous experiments in capitalist restoration.</p>

  <p>So you became nervous and fidgety, scared that you would be ousted by people you
  should know are not the type to take rash measures. Amazingly, though, Gorbachev went
  you one better. He called out the army. The situation merely called for assuring, with
  minimum police measures, that the demonstration would be orderly. But Gorbachev too
  suffers from the same disease, even more: fear of the masses, fear that the whole thing
  is based on a misconception, that the restructuring is leading nowhere, that it is a
  bourgeois fantasy.</p>

  <p>It is these incredible blunders that delight the hearts of the imperialist
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>There's one other thing you must take into account. The ruling circles in the Bush
  administration have got your number. They know about your vulgar behavior last time you
  visited the United States. It was carefully documented in the capitalist press here.
  They didn't try to discredit you. They printed it in quite a low-profile way. But there
  it was.</p>

  <p>They also know that you phonied up an attempted assassination story. They know you
  got yourself into so many contradictions about it that the only way you could get out
  was to open a huge assault against the Gorbachev centrists, blaming them for all the
  economic chaos and disorder in order to divert the issue.</p>

  <p>It was a fascist trick. Many in the U.S. capitalist establishment recognize it as
  the type of thing Huey Long would have done. He once mobilized a mass demonstration at
  the state house in Louisiana and tried to intimidate the legislators.</p>

  <p>A well-known liberal commentator in the New York Times, Tom Wicker, wrote a book in
  which he claimed that Long actually meant to be a liberal. Some of the measures he
  introduced and carried out were indeed liberal. But that was only because the Roosevelt
  administration had embarked on a series of reforms, some of them almost revolutionary
  for the time, under pressure of the masses. Huey Long took advantage of that.</p>

  <h4>A sacred principle sacrificed</h4>

  <p>Now, Boris Yeltsin, who are you going to meet in Washington if they decide to meet
  with you? So far you've got this bunch of Harvard whiz kids who are going to teach you
  how to bring capitalism to the USSR. In our view, it's a burlesque. It's so patently
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>Not one of the big bourgeois economists in the administration is involved in this
  maneuver. Yet you and Gorbachev have sent down your best, most capable economists so
  they can be taught how to bring about capitalism. It boggles the imagination.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev is now in another part of the world, virtually begging to get into the
  conclave of the seven imperialist powers and participate as one of them. But they
  wouldn't let him in. He can only meet with them individually in his attempt to get the
  imperialist powers, especially the U.S., to expend enormous sums &mdash; many billions
  of dollars &mdash; to help rescue the Soviet economy.</p>

  <p>But the imperialists are not interested in rescuing the Soviet economy. They are
  interested in advancing money for profitable investments. At the moment, and perhaps
  for years to come, the USSR does not appear to them as the safe and secure investment
  they seek.</p>

  <p>You have only to read any one of the capitalist newspapers to see that's what
  they're saying. Nevertheless, Gorbachev continues to reach for a will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

  <p>Up to this moment the imperialist governments have extended just a minimum of credit
  to the USSR. And they only did that after getting a humiliating capitulation on what,
  since the Bolshevik Revolution, had been considered a sacred principle of Soviet
  foreign policy. That was to never pay back the loans taken out by the czarist
  government for the imperialist war of 1914-1917, in which so many millions of people
  were killed.</p>

  <p>This was one of the anti-war demands of the Bolsheviks, and they lived up to their
  promise when they canceled the debts. Through civil war, military intervention, the
  Nazi invasion and the Cold War, the imperialists were never able to get the Soviet
  Union to even talk about paying the czarist war debts.</p>

  <p>It took Gorbachev to negotiate the payment. He was promised that this would ease the
  way for the imperialist governments to open their purses and provide guaranteed
  loans.</p>

  <p>Thus, on Jan. 22, 1988, Soviet and West German banking officials revealed that the
  USSR had agreed to pay off czarist Russian debts to Switzerland in return for Swiss
  approval of a bond offering. It was the result of long negotiations with then-Prime
  Minister Margaret Thatcher of England, who talked Gorbachev into it. The idea was that
  this would provide an incentive to the capitalist governments to facilitate loans to
  the USSR.</p>

  <p>But little has happened since then. This should be differentiated from the arena of
  the commercial banks, which have extended to the USSR loans that now number something
  in the realm of $30 or $40 billion. There is uncertainty as to whether the USSR can
  make interest payments under current circumstances. Such is the situation with a
  country that was only a few years ago the most credit-worthy government in the
  world.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding glasnost, there is great secrecy surrounding the financial
  operations of the Soviet banking system as they relate to international transactions
  with the imperialist powers. As the squeeze by the imperialists for payment of interest
  and principle continued, it reached a point where the USSR had to deplete its gold
  reserves. The USSR is the second largest gold producer in the world after South Africa.
  It has had to transport gold bullion in large quantities for the payment of debts. This
  will surely aggravate the economic crisis.</p>

  <p>Now there is a rush to convert the ruble into foreign currencies in order to
  normalize trade and commerce with the imperialist West. This would be a sign of health
  if the Soviet economy were growing and there was economic and political stability. But
  under current circumstances, the rush to convert the ruble into foreign currencies can
  only serve to aggravate the situation. Furthermore, with the Soviet government relying
  so much on imperialist good will, it is now easier for the imperialists to organize a
  run on the Soviet ruble.</p>

  <p>There is practically no area of international commerce and diplomacy where one can
  see an uplifting development for the USSR. In all his visits abroad, Gorbachev has been
  flattered no end. But there have been no material advantages for the USSR. Wherever he
  goes he fears to tread on U.S. toes.</p>

  <h4>Great Russian chauvinism and the Tokyo talks</h4>

  <p>When his visit to Japan was arranged, it appeared to be the one diplomatic opening
  of advantage to the USSR. Japan is the one imperialist government in a position to
  advance loans without first getting the permission of the U.S. If the visit had any
  diplomatic objective other than so-called good will, it must have been to obtain loans
  for investments and industrial projects. It would also give the USSR an opportunity to
  show some independence from U.S. imperialism.</p>

  <p>Instead, a series of articles appeared in the Soviet press written in such a hostile
  manner as to deliberately close the door to any negotiations on the Kuril Islands
  &mdash; a leftover, secondary issue between the two governments. It was a favorable
  time for negotiations precisely because of the so-called end of the Cold War. Neither
  the U.S. nor the Japanese military had a hard and fast position on this. But the
  Japanese were confronted with a fait accompli.</p>

  <p>In 1956, Khrushchev had signed an agreement that opened the door to negotiations on
  these islands. Gorbachev's visit was supposed to be a continuation of that process, but
  under much more favorable circumstances for the USSR.</p>

  <p>The islands are populated by Russians. If the Kuril Islands had any strategic
  significance they would certainly have attracted the attention of the Soviet military,
  which would have made itself heard. Instead, however, the voices raised in the Soviet
  press reflected rank Russian chauvinism concerning the fate of the Russians in the
  Kurils if they were taken over by the Japanese. That could easily inflame Russian
  public opinion in a racist way, as happened in England with the Malvinas.</p>

  <p>Thus, the longest negotiations Gorbachev ever attended were a complete failure. He
  himself characterized them as fit to go into the Guinness Book of World Records and
  having accomplished nothing. So the one window of opportunity to show some
  disengagement from U.S. imperialism and at the same time win some loans or contracts
  for industrial development was thrown to the winds to satisfy Great Russian
  chauvinism.</p>

  <h4>Elementary economics</h4>

  <p>In your book <em>Against the Grain</em> you say that Russia is a super-rich country.
  One might well agree with you, Boris Yeltsin. But so are Brazil, Indonesia, the Middle
  East and certainly a great part of Africa. You seem to overlook one of the most
  elementary concepts of Marxist economics. Riches in capitalist society are not only use
  values. If that were all that was involved, this planet would have very few problems
  indeed, because the riches could be distributed in accordance with a plan and with the
  needs of the people.</p>

  <p>You talk about use values. But you have come to the United States to talk to the
  capitalist politicians and bankers on the basis that these use values are also
  commodities with exchange value. And therein lies the problem.</p>

  <p>The imperialists at the other end of the table view the USSR's natural wealth and
  the Soviet economic and technological infrastructure from the viewpoint of its exchange
  value. They understand the most elementary lesson of Marxism that you have forgotten:
  that a commodity must have an exchange value as well as a use value.</p>

  <p>There's a superabundance of natural and technological wealth all around, created by
  nature and by workers. But its value to the capitalists is only significant insofar as
  a profit can be made. These elementary propositions should be understood by one who had
  the opportunity to be trained in Marxist economics.</p>

  <p>In other words, these riches have to have salability. They have to be exchanged in
  such proportion and under such circumstances as are compatible with the capitalist
  profit mode. If this were not so, Japan would not be the powerful capitalist economy it
  is. And Brazil would not be in the situation it is today.</p>

  <p>Look at a Newsday report (June 17) on Brazil: "A majority of Brazilians do not have
  access to clean drinking water. The nation has virtually no sewage treatment of any
  kind. In the cities, raw sewage is dumped into the ground or into conduits that cast
  untreated sludge into the ocean. In the countryside, open-pit latrines are the rule.
  Well water is often contaminated with deadly bacteria. Even without cholera, which is
  now spreading, diarrhea and stomach infections are a major cause of death among the
  poor."</p>

  <p>Yet Brazil, judged by its natural wealth and some of its industrial infrastructure,
  is a very rich country. The problem is that Brazil is part of the capitalist mode of
  production. Its riches, its use values, are only taken into account insofar as they
  become commodities for exchange.</p>

  <p>At the current time, contemporary imperialism is in the doldrums. It is true that
  one of its characteristic features is the search for markets all over the world, for
  investment and exploitation. But for now and perhaps for years to come, these markets
  are glutted. This is true despite or perhaps because of the dizzying development of
  high technology. Previous technology, to which millions of labor hours were devoted,
  becomes obsolete precisely because of the speed with which newer technology becomes
  more easily marketable.</p>

  <h4>A missed opportunity</h4>

  <p>Stalin's death for the first time presented an opportunity to the Soviet leaders to
  arrange for an orderly succession. More important, they had a chance to reappraise not
  only Stalin's personal leadership but the political and economic situation in the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>The ascension of Khrushchev as secretary of the party ended in a secret trial of
  Lavrenti Beria, then the minister of internal affairs, which was hailed by the world
  press and, not without justification, in the USSR itself. But it was not carried out in
  the spirit of revolutionary working class democracy. Followers of the Stalin faction
  were ousted one by one and then as a group, without the necessary preparation and
  openness that was essential not only for a reappraisal of the Stalin era but to
  politically reform the Soviet state.</p>

  <p>The leadership was incapable of doing this. Moreover, there were fears of the
  imperialists &mdash; and of the masses at home, from whom they have only a narrow
  margin of legitimacy, which for the party was inadequate for a broad-based revival of
  working class democracy.</p>

  <p>Khrushchev seems to have panicked in the course of preparing for the 20th Congress
  of the party in 1956. Instead of an orderly, open discussion of the Stalin era, he
  seems to have sort of spilled his guts in a secret report, which could only have
  demoralized large sections of the party. The secrecy of the report was short-lived. The
  CIA soon printed it in the New York Times, probably adding much that was not in it. To
  this day, the actual report has not been published. An orderly succession in the spirit
  of working class democracy was missed.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the death of Chernenko in 1985 offered a real opportunity for
  reevaluation in the spirit of revolutionary Marxism, in the spirit of socialist
  construction and the advance forward to communism. Chernenko's illness was well known.
  There was sufficient time for discussion and preparation.</p>

  <p>Unquestionably, groupings were formed. The pro-socialist left was headed by
  Ligachev, who was not a politician but more in the nature of an ideological leader.
  Gorbachev was in the center. And you, Boris Yeltsin? You preferred to place yourself at
  the extreme right.</p>

  <h4>Counterrevolutionary leader or captive?</h4>

  <p>What was the issue? In the 1980s the growth of the Soviet Union had slowed somewhat
  as against the growth in the Western capitalist countries. That was the problem. Call
  it stagnation or whatever, there was unquestionably a slowing of growth. But there was
  not a fall-off in industrial production. There was not a crisis in consumer goods
  industries. There was not a crisis in agriculture.</p>

  <p>There have been many explanations tendered by bourgeois sources. The 1987 book
  <em>Blood in the Streets</em> by James Davidson and Sir William Rees-Mogg had this to
  say: "While the Soviet Union could turn in respectable rates of economic growth so long
  as it was industrializing, it was doomed once the world economy shifted from slabs of
  steel to producing complex silicon chips."</p>

  <p>Either commentaries have all been to the effect that the Soviet economy could grow
  only as long as heavy industry was king, but once the computer revolution came along it
  fell way behind.</p>

  <p>Many bourgeois commentators &mdash; some of them authoritative &mdash; have argued
  that is the basic cause of the decline in the Soviet Union's growth rate. But by the
  time of Chernenko's death, you and the other comrades had ample opportunity to discuss
  and evaluate the basis for this decline. At the very next plenum of the Central
  Committee, the question of modernizing the technology and industrial equipment of the
  USSR was the most important point on the agenda. It was agreed to embark on a vast
  program to bring up to date the scientific-technological revolution.</p>

  <p>Boris Yeltsin, you were one of those who voted for it. You all agreed on it. But
  subsequently, in smaller groupings, and especially in the Politburo, a sharp change in
  perspective occurred. Instead of identifying the need to rationalize the infrastructure
  of the USSR as the principal task facing the party and the country, the orientation
  became to create new social relations &mdash; in other words, to embark upon a course
  of social counterrevolution.</p>

  <p>You could have used your engineering training to fight for what originally was the
  perspective outlined in the 1985 plenum of the Central Committee. You could have
  offered your expertise to help in the modernization program so a
  scientific-technological revolution could change the industrial infrastructure of the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>Instead, you not only went along with an attempt to reverse the course of socialist
  construction, but took the far right position. So now, Boris Yeltsin, you find yourself
  in the position of being the leader of the counterrevolutionary restorationist
  movement.</p>

  <p>You took the road of a bourgeois politician. You placed yourself at the extreme end
  of the developing factionalism in the summits of the Communist Party leadership. You
  scented the growing strength of the bourgeois stratum, especially in the big cities of
  Moscow and Leningrad, the old fortresses of the proletarian revolution and of the
  working class. You scented that the social composition had changed, offering a vehicle
  for an "independent" road.</p>

  <p>You became the leader of the Inter-Regional Group in the parliament, which is
  notorious for being subsidized by the CIA. What is a small subsidy for some 30 or 50
  parliamentarians to the CIA? They did it in Nicaragua. And the U.S. has spent hundreds
  of billions of dollars in a nuclear race with the USSR. This, by comparison, is small
  potatoes. Who knows how many others in this bourgeois parliament have been subsidized
  in the same way? Yeltsin, you should ask yourself: are you leader or captive of the
  bourgeois counterrevolution?</p>

  <h4>Socialism not finished in USSR</h4>

  <p>You are finding, moreover, that this counterrevolution &mdash; and that's what it
  amounts to &mdash; can't be accomplished by the reactionary forces in the USSR alone.
  You can't reverse the social and economic system by the narrow stratum of the
  bourgeoisie and their ilk in the USSR. To accomplish a complete overturn of the years
  and years of socialist construction will require substantial penetration by U.S.
  finance capital. In reality, the situation is rotten-ripe for you and Gorbachev to
  mortgage the USSR on the altar of capitalist reconstruction in the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>But you forget a secret of social systems &mdash; primary communism, chattel
  slavery, feudalism, capitalism. None of these social systems ever really disappears
  until its potentialities have been exhausted. The same also goes for socialism. The
  potential for the development of socialism has not been exhausted in the USSR. Its
  development has always been constricted by a predatory imperialist power that has never
  allowed the Soviet Union to breathe a moment in peace. To now bind it hand and foot to
  the imperialist banks and the Pentagon is the kind of perspective that appeals only to
  outright renegades from communism and puppets of imperialism.</p>

  <p>Boris Yeltsin, the best thing you can do for yourself and for the USSR is to pack
  your bags and unceremoniously leave the U.S. without any commitment. Explain to your
  colleagues and comrades at home that the road to capitalist restoration would make all
  of Russia a neocolonialist base for imperialist aggression, especially against China.
  This would be the real darkness at noon.</p>
