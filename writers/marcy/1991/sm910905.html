  <h1>The ABC of the crisis in the USSR</h1>

  <h2>A Marxist analysis of the current struggle</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Sept. 5, 1991)</h5>

  <p>Boris Yeltsin, the chief architect of capitalist counterrevolution in the USSR, and
  his partner in crime Mikhail Gorbachev seem now to be firmly in the saddle. But it is a
  saddle mounted on a cow. They are going nowhere.</p>

  <p>Economic decline and social and political disintegration is absolutely inevitable.
  The imperialists of the world know this. No amount of hurried state visits by John
  Major, the Thatcherite British prime minister, will in any way persuade George Bush to
  quickly open U.S. imperialism's treasuries to the USSR.</p>

  <p>What the Gorbachev regime has been doing over the last five years in its effort to
  decentralize socialist planning in the USSR is like breaking up giant ocean liners in
  an attempt to create small rowboats. It's an ideal of the petty bourgeois merchant and
  shopkeeper.</p>

  <h4>Decentralization a disaster</h4>

  <p>Decentralization has brought one economic disaster after another. The attempt to
  break up the mines and sell them to investors from abroad is the worst example of
  reactionary utopianism. It's even worse with the oil industry, which is wholly
  integrated, as are iron and steel and the military-industrial complex.</p>

  <p>Now the Gorbachev-Yeltsin team is in the unhappy position of trying to recentralize
  the economy. But find it impossible to do so except on the existing socialist basis.
  The private, bourgeois sector is unable to become a viable factor in the economy.</p>

  <p>The absurdity of chopping up the socialist sector while at the same time wildly
  promising the masses a higher living standard is bound to bring the real criminal
  conspirators to grief.</p>

  <h4>What's at stake?</h4>

  <p>Before it is possible to come to grips with the current struggle in the USSR &mdash;
  the struggle between those who are for socialism and those who want to restore
  capitalism &mdash; it is necessary to get some understanding of the difference between
  a social revolution and a political revolution (or counterrevolution).</p>

  <p>A political revolution can involve the mobilization of large masses of people in
  support of the transfer of power from one group to another. If this transfer is carried
  out by only a small grouping, especially involving violence and unconstitutional means,
  it would constitute a palace coup.</p>

  <p>But whether or not masses of people are involved, a political revolution leaves the
  economic, financial and social authority in the hands of the same ruling class. It does
  not fundamentally alter the relationship between the basic social classes: the
  possessing, exploiting class versus the exploited. The real power, the ownership of the
  means of production, remains in the hands of those who wielded it before &mdash; in
  modern times, the bankers, industrialists, and landlords.</p>

  <p>There have been many political revolutions. Much rarer is a social revolution.</p>

  <p>A social revolution transfers power from one class to another. If power is
  transferred away from the bankers, industrialists, and landlords to the workers and the
  peasants, the mass of the people, then it is a proletarian socialist revolution.</p>

  <p>The first and classic example of this was the Paris Commune of 1871, which lasted
  only a few months and was drowned in blood by the armed might of the ruling class.</p>

  <p>The first successful proletarian socialist revolution occurred in October 1917 in
  Russia. The state the workers erected has survived until now because of untold
  sacrifices by the masses, who endured civil war, imperialist intervention, cold war,
  and threats of nuclear annihilation, not to speak of economic blockade and capitalist
  encirclement all these years.</p>

  <p>This state of the workers and peasants has undergone formidable changes, both
  political and social, and has suffered a number of distortions and deformations. The
  question is whether this state will in the current crisis hold onto the possibility of
  regaining its fundamental socialist features.</p>

  <p>The working class and the oppressed peoples of the world, numbering in the billions,
  have a great stake in this contest. Its outcome could decide the future of the class
  struggle for years to come.</p>

  <h4>Imperialists celebrate too soon</h4>

  <p>Anyone reading the headlines in the major bourgeois newspapers at this time could
  draw only one conclusion: that it's all over for socialism and communism in the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>As for Workers World, although for the last five years we have forecast a great many
  of the disastrous economic, social and political developments now taking place in the
  USSR, we do not share the fatalism the capitalist press so assiduously cultivates. The
  capitalist class is celebrating much too soon. The working class of the USSR has not
  yet entered the arena of struggle.</p>

  <p>In order to have a greater understanding of the situation in the USSR, it is
  necessary also to have a clearer conception of the phenomenon of a coup d'etat.</p>

  <p>A coup d'etat &mdash; literally, a blow against the state &mdash; sometimes occurs
  when a small group, either military or civilian, overturns the existing government and
  installs itself as the new governing power. The distinctive characteristic of a coup,
  whether done through violence or other illegal or unconstitutional means, is that it is
  carried out without the participation or knowledge, and often with the indifference, of
  the masses.</p>

  <p>Frequently it abolishes whatever democratic institutions existed in the country. But
  history also shows that a coup d'etat, a change in the governing group of the state,
  can take place without any fundamental political changes. It doesn't have to result in
  or the abolition or restriction of democratic institutions such as the parliament, the
  congress or freedom of the press.</p>

  <h4>Was Kennedy assassination a coup?</h4>

  <p>For instance, it was widely suspected that the assassination of President John F.
  Kennedy was part of a coup d'etat that brought Lyndon Johnson to power. He was not only
  the vice president under Kennedy but had been his principal right-wing rival during the
  struggle for the Democratic nomination.</p>

  <p>One week after his swearing in as president, Lyndon Johnson appointed Supreme Court
  Chief Justice Earl Warren to head a commission of investigation. Its function was to
  give credibility to a coverup of the coup.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Court of the U.S. and its chief justice have no constitutional authority
  to assume investigative powers. They had never done so before. Their authority is
  restricted to cases between litigants seeking adjudication. This investigation was even
  more irregular considering that Lyndon Johnson was regarded as a prime suspect in the
  conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy.</p>

  <p>In his own account of what happened, Johnson wrote, "I knew it was not a good
  precedent to involve the Supreme Court in such an investigation. Chief Justice Warren
  knew this too and was vigorously opposed to it. I called him in anyway. Before he came,
  he sent word through a third party that he would not accept the assignment. He opposed
  serving on constitutional grounds." (Lyndon B. Johnson, <em>The Vantage Point</em> [New
  York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1971].)</p>

  <p>The jurisdiction for such an investigation properly lay in the hands of the Attorney
  General &mdash; Robert F. Kennedy. But he appeared to be in a demoralized state during
  this period and did not challenge Johnson's authority. Later, when RFK ran in the 1968
  primary for the presidential nomination, he too was assassinated.</p>

  <h4>Nixon ousted</h4>

  <p>Richard Nixon, the next president and the third occupant in the White House during
  the murderous Vietnam war, often seemed on the verge of being ousted. After he
  attempted to set up a spy network outside of the jurisdiction of the FBI and CIA, the
  capitalist press began to pillory Nixon. His opponents threatened to impeach him and
  remove him from office.</p>

  <p>As a crisis neared, Nixon appointed General Alexander Haig as White House Chief of
  Staff in an attempt to line the Army up behind him. But certain incriminating tapes on
  Nixon's conspiracy to set up an independent spy grouping fell into the hands of those
  who could expose them to the public.</p>

  <p>General Haig then demanded that Attorney General Elliot Richardson, who was
  investigating the Watergate break-in, return the tapes. But the special prosecutor,
  Archibald Cox, got a court ruling against Nixon which was later appealed to the U.S.
  Supreme Court.</p>

  <p>The issue then was whether the president was legally obligated to obey a Supreme
  Court order. Could the judicial branch constitutionally demand that the executive
  branch carry out its order?</p>

  <p>Could a coup d'etat could triumph under these circumstances? The issue was whether
  General Haig could represent the military establishment as a whole and bring it to bear
  against the Supreme Court.</p>

  <p>But the capitalist press and most of the institutions of the bourgeois state were
  solidly opposed to Nixon. This included the military. Finally Nixon resigned to avoid
  impeachment.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Gen. Douglas MacArthur had pushed for overall political and military
  authority during the Korea crisis. A few years later, Senator Joseph McCarthy attempted
  to subdue the Senate and the House. Only when he stepped on the toes of the Army did
  the tide begin to turn against his wild witch hunt. The U.S. capitalist press and media
  continually gush about their democracy, seeming oblivious to these coup attempts.</p>

  <p>Such is the glorious democracy in the U.S.!</p>

  <h4>Character of struggle in USSR</h4>

  <p>Briefly, this is what happened in the most recent phase of the struggle in the
  USSR:</p>

  <p>On Aug. 19, eight of the most important members of the Soviet government, military
  and security forces announced the formation of a State Committee for the State of
  Emergency. They effectively put Mikhail Gorbachev, who was on vacation in the Crimea,
  under house arrest. Who were the eight? They were not an obscure grouping. Rather, they
  represented the greater part of the government itself. This aspect the capitalist press
  leaves out.</p>

  <p>The eight were: Gennadi I. Yanayev, Vice President of the USSR; Valentin S. Pavlov,
  Prime Minister; Gen. Dmitri T. Yazov, Defense Minister; Aleksandr I. Tizyakov,
  president of an association of state industries; Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, Chairman of the
  KGB; Vasily A. Starodubtsev, Chairman of the Farmers' Union; Oleg D. Baklanov, first
  deputy chair of the Defense Council; and Boris K. Pugo, Interior Minister.</p>

  <p>This grouping was in reality more representative of the state than the two
  individuals against whom the coup was directed, Gorbachev and Yeltsin.</p>

  <p>Their idea was to get this Emergency Committee ratified by the Supreme Soviet and
  the Congress of Deputies. In that case, whatever may have been considered
  unconstitutional would be ratified by legal bodies.</p>

  <p>The move by the Emergency Committee was completely bloodless. The imperialist media
  and the Yeltsin forces make much of the fact that three people died, and at first
  claimed they had been shot by soldiers. But it was later confirmed they had been
  crushed by accident during the movement of armored personnel carriers in Moscow (just
  as U.S. personnel are killed nearly every time the Pentagon deploys its forces).</p>

  <p>During the entire course of Soviet history, when various government leaders were
  removed by the party, it scarcely caused a ripple in the imperialist countries. Were
  this attempt at a takeover merely a coup d'etat in the political sense of the term, it
  would have caused little concern among the Western imperialist countries.</p>

  <p>A palace coup or revolution would not have aroused their indignation or the swift
  and feverish preparations to intervene. It was not the political changes or changes in
  personnel that were of significance to the imperialist bourgeoisie. In other words, it
  was not the political revolution that concerned the imperialists abroad and the
  bourgeois elements in the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>The fact of the matter is that the Emergency Committee was attempting to return to
  the course of socialist construction and to abolish, to the extent possible, the
  ruinous and chaotic consequences of Gorbachev's introduction of capitalist relations.
  What was involved was a changeover from one social system to another. In other words,
  it was a social counterrevolution that was at stake, not just political changes.</p>

  <h4>Question of democracy</h4>

  <p>Of least concern to the West was the question of democracy in the Soviet Union.
  Imperialism is the biggest violator of genuine democracy, the democracy of the workers,
  at home and abroad. The men they hail as democrats have now closed Pravda, purged other
  organs of the press and media, and pretty much outlawed the Communist Party itself,
  with millions of members.</p>

  <p>The matter reduced itself to this quintessential element: The Gorbachev regime,
  immediately after he became party general secretary at the Central Committee plenary
  meeting in 1985, slowly and gradually began a course of development which lead straight
  to capitalist restoration at home and the intervention of the imperialist bourgeoisie.
  For too long a time, the Communist Party leadership, in disregard of revolutionary
  tradition and resting on privileges it had accumulated over the years for itself, went
  along with Gorbachev.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev grouping seemed to have won an accommodation from the imperialist
  bourgeoisie. Slow and gradual nuclear disarmament and improvement of relations appeared
  on the order of the day.</p>

  <p>Not clearly understood was the fact that the imperialist countries, while
  overflowing with flattery of Gorbachev and effusive expressions of accommodation with
  the USSR, were moving at a snail's pace to lift their virtual economic blockade. Only
  in the last few days, really, has the ban on trade with the USSR been lifted. Only in
  the last few weeks has the European Community, the community of imperialist robbers and
  colonialist predators, begun to deal with the USSR on a somewhat equal basis.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the country has been opened up to the ravages of the imperialist
  monopolies that are making deals with individual republics of the kind that could only
  reduce the Soviet Union to a neocolonialist status. It was not until a scandalous joint
  venture involving the fabulously rich Kazakhstan oil fields was accidentally made
  public that the masses got a view of the extent to which the imperialists had
  encroached and had found willing tools to virtually sell out to the giant Chevron
  multinational. The deal involved the USSR's most important energy resources &mdash; the
  vast Tenghiz oil fields.</p>

  <p>But those are only the outer manifestations. The Gorbachev administration's policies
  at home were becoming increasingly ruinous. The effort, under the euphemism of a market
  economy, to reintroduce private ownership of the basic means of production meant
  bringing back the relationship of exploiter and exploited in the USSR. This finally
  touched off the emergency measures to try and halt this social and political
  catastrophe.</p>

  <p>It is now backhandedly admitted by the imperialist bourgeoisie that the economic
  conditions &mdash; the shortage, the empty shelves, the idle factories and so on
  &mdash; all the result from the attempt to dismantle the socialist projects in the
  USSR.</p>

  <h4>Six years of perestroika</h4>

  <p>Much to the surprise of the bourgeois reformers there as well as their Western
  masters, the task of bringing about a reestablishment of capitalism has proven to be
  stupendously difficult. The Gorbachev program is now well into its sixth year, and the
  easy dismantling of the socialist system the imperialists expected has not taken place
  to this very day.</p>

  <p>This explains why the imperialists are so unwilling to extend cash or even credit to
  a willing group of neocolonialist stooges. The task of overturning, of obliterating the
  revolutionary socialist achievements of the USSR may well prove impossible.</p>

  <p>However, the masses for most of this period were unaware of what the Gorbachev
  conspirators contemplated. To this very day, when the Gorbachev-Yeltsin alliance seems
  to be in power, the bourgeois reformers have not ceased to make wildly demagogic
  promises of a higher standard of living. In reality, however, their plans call for
  cutbacks, layoffs and a general reduction in living standards. The Yeltsin-Gorbachev
  economists are at wit's end over how to explain that harder, not easier times are ahead
  if the introduction of capitalism is to take place, even as the politicians of the
  restoration make the most scandalous promises of a higher standard of living. No wonder
  confusion reigns supreme.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev press is monolithic in advertising its virtues. However, those in the
  opposition who want to expose the true character of the bourgeois reforms have really
  had no voice, either in the government or in the press. And now the leading organs of
  the Communist Party have been muzzled.</p>

  <p>The irony of this historic episode is that the confusion has lasted so long.
  Finally, however, it became virtually impossible to continue further on the course of
  capitalist restoration without an upheaval of one sort or another.</p>

  <p>The coup attempt, if we may properly call it that, came as a last resort in the face
  of an impending disaster to socialist construction. These eight men, and many of their
  supporters in the government who became more and more knowledgeable and fearful of the
  consequences of bourgeois restoration, decided it was the only course to take.</p>

  <h4>What were they afraid of?</h4>

  <p>Yet they acted timidly and with hesitation. What was their greatest fear? It was
  retaliation by the imperialist bourgeoisie &mdash; the continuing nightmare that has
  hung over the Soviet republic since day one of the October socialist revolution.</p>

  <p>Hence they plodded along on a course of action intended to take the imperialist
  bourgeoisie off guard.</p>

  <p>They issued an utterly inept and scandalously vague statement calculated to assure
  the imperialist bourgeoisie that foreign policy toward the imperialists remain the same
  and the reforms at home would continue. Not even the word socialism was mentioned in
  the manifesto, which promised that private property and the market economy would
  continue.</p>

  <p>It is not unusual for those attempting a coup, especially when there is a swift
  change of government in a country, to assure the world that there will be no
  fundamental changes and that foreign policy will continue as before.</p>

  <p>For instance, when Johnson took over as president, his first statements were
  calculated to assure the world that there would not be any fundamental change,
  especially in regard to the war in Vietnam.</p>

  <p>Especially in countries that are militarily weak, whenever there's a change in
  government the immediate problem is to assure the imperialists that no fundamental
  changes would be made of the type that would enrage them.</p>

  <p>But this manifesto by the Emergency Committee could never convince the imperialist
  bourgeoisie that they weren't planning a return to socialist construction. The very men
  who constituted themselves as the new government were known as relatively hardline
  Communists. Even though they had gone very far with the Gorbachev reforms, they were
  regarded as opposed to the restoration of capitalism.</p>

  <p>Their manifesto, then, was a great miscalculation. The imperialist bourgeoisie
  wasn't fooled in the least. It immediately began to mobilize world public opinion and
  even intervened actively on behalf of the counterrevolution.</p>

  <h4>Conspiracy over the heads of the masses</h4>

  <p>But the worst mistake of all was that they violated one of the most profound
  teachings of Marxism on the relationship of insurrection to a coup d'etat, the
  relationship between the masses and the leaders. The way they went about it was to
  indulge in the crudest form of Blanquism, trying to carry out a conspiracy without mass
  support. Nevertheless, the masses on the whole accepted the coup.</p>

  <p>This could be seen by their rejection of Boris Yeltsin's call to go out on a general
  strike. But the Emergency Committee deprived the masses of the opportunity to give
  active support to the struggle against Yeltsin and Gorbachev.</p>

  <p>This group of state and party leaders had not agitated, had not organized, had not
  publicly committed themselves to the revival of socialist construction. Certainly, they
  gave hinted now and then that they were critical of the Gorbachev reforms. But there
  was never any general attempt at agitation and propaganda against the bourgeois reforms
  and the continuing slide toward capitalist restoration.</p>

  <p>By not taking the masses into their confidence, these leaders disregarded the
  essence of the October 1917 insurrection. They should have openly opposed Gorbachev as
  the Bolsheviks opposed the Kerensky regime. The Bolsheviks agitated for the
  insurrection openly. At the same time they were continually meeting in secret to work
  out the plans for the insurrection. They had every justification for this, since
  Kerensky himself was plotting the destruction of the revolutionary Bolshevik leadership
  of the Soviets.</p>

  <p>The czar's chief general, Kornilov, was involved in his own conspiracy. The
  Bolsheviks promoted a revolutionary course for the overthrow of the Kerensky regime
  quite openly, while secretly organizing the mechanics and crucial timing.</p>

  <p>In this case the Emergency Committee finally achieved a consensus among themselves
  to get rid of the bourgeois restorationist grouping. But where they failed was in their
  estimate of the imperialist bourgeoisie's reaction. Most of all they failed to mobilize
  the masses and the rank and file of the soldiers. The masses were left in the dark and
  became prey to general confusion and unawareness.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the mass sentiment can be gauged by this: When Yeltsin, the principal
  architect for counterrevolution, was taken by surprise by the coup (that much the
  Emergency Committee planned well), he hastily called for a general strike of the
  workers. It was a near-total failure, as almost everybody now admits.</p>

  <p>From there on it should have been clear to the committee that it was necessary to
  take action, firmly and without hesitation, not merely against Gorbachev but against
  Yeltsin. Whatever else they did, they had to move now. What stopped them?</p>

  <p>Fear of imperialist aggression. Failure to mobilize the masses actively. Yeltsin was
  feverishly mobilizing the counterrevolutionary elements while the committee stood
  still, either hesitant or divided over taking the decisive step of attacking. At such a
  moment, indecision is ruinous.</p>

  <p>The most devastating error was a failure to make a clear-cut case over a protracted
  period of time that the so-called market economy was in reality a move to restore the
  old capitalist system of exploitation and oppression. Because they had not said so in
  so many words, the Emergency Committee left the masses at the mercy of bourgeois
  concepts of legality introduced by the Gorbachev administration to cover up its
  destruction of socialist norms.</p>

  <h4>Bourgeois legality</h4>

  <p>The Gorbachev grouping had abandoned socialist legality and substituted bourgeois
  legality. The Emergency Committee was not bound in principle to respect bourgeois
  concepts of legality. Furthermore, they should have borne in mind the difference
  between a social and a political revolution.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev grouping had claimed it was carrying out a political revolution. But
  it had overstepped the bounds of a political revolution and was attempting to
  disestablish and in fact to ruin the class structure of the workers' state. Therefore,
  the committee had every right to promote not only general socialist criticism of the
  Gorbachev regime but revolutionary communist agitation for its overthrow.</p>

  <p>When faced with a social counterrevolution, where a transfer of class power is
  involved, legality is inadequate considering the magnitude of the issue. But the
  committee had socialist legality on its side. And even had this not been true, it could
  have been guided by the advice of another leader at another time.</p>

  <p>It was Abraham Lincoln who said in his First Inaugural Address, on March 4, 1861:
  "This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever
  they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their
  constitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary right to dismember or
  overthrow it." Lincoln was in the middle of a class struggle between the slaves and
  slave owners. The slave owners pretended to legality, declaring states' rights.</p>

  <p>The committee should have invoked the revolutionary right of the people in order to
  mobilize the masses against what was in reality a cold, clandestine takeover of a good
  part of the government by the bourgeois elements led by Gorbachev and Yeltsin.</p>

  <h4>Union of republics is an economic reality</h4>

  <p>The capitalist press views the dismemberment of the USSR as a <em>fait
  accompli.</em> We have continually pointed out that the greatest danger in the
  bourgeois reforms was that the collapse of centralized planning set in motion
  centrifugal forces that threatened to turn all against all, as in Yugoslavia.</p>

  <p>Now the Baltic republics, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Moldavia, Byelorussia, and
  Georgia are all said to be asserting their independence. Of course we have pointed out
  this danger. It is a great stride backward in the decentralization and breakup of the
  Soviet Union. Nevertheless it is necessary to show its limitations and possible
  direction.</p>

  <p>It is one thing to juridically or politically separate from the USSR. We communists,
  basing ourselves on the teachings of Leninism, have continued to adhere to the right of
  self-determination, including the right to secede, which has been written into all the
  constitutions since the formation of the USSR.</p>

  <p>But it is something else again, 74 years after the Revolution and after more than a
  dozen five-year plans, to equate a juridical or political separation with economic
  separation.</p>

  <p>In the first place, the Ukraine and Byelorussia have been politically independent
  for years, although acting in unison with the Soviet government. Both have seats in the
  UN and separate embassies in all the countries that recognize the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>When it comes to negotiations on grain, for instance, the Ukrainian delegation
  generally handles them. Although the imperialist governments refuse to admit it, they
  nevertheless have given them de facto recognition.</p>

  <p>What about the Baltic states? What does their independence really amount to?
  Economically they can scarcely exist unless the Soviet Union provides them with oil at
  the cheapest prices and a market for their consumer goods. They can't possibly hope to
  compete with the imperialist West in the production of consumer goods. The USSR is
  their best customer.</p>

  <p>In the Baltic area, except for Latvia which has a great revolutionary and Bolshevik
  tradition, the biggest problem for the Soviet Union is the reservoir of Nazi and
  fascist ideology in the ruling classes, particularly among the landed gentry. This is
  reinforced by a right-wing Catholic hierarchy, especially in Lithuania.</p>

  <p>The real significance of this area to the Soviet Union leaders is military. They
  fear it will become a base for the U.S. military.</p>

  <p>We should not regard the disintegration of the union as a finished process. Moldavia
  has announced its independence 100 times. It nevertheless is an economically integrated
  part of the USSR. It and others are not economically viable on their own. What brought
  this about is the great economic and technological progress of the USSR over 70 years
  of socialist construction.</p>

  <p>To break up the union politically is to make economic regression inevitable. This
  goes for all the Soviet republics.</p>

  <p>It is quite impossible to establish a stable capitalist system on the basis of
  economic disunity, and any attempt would be costly in human life and welfare. One only
  has to look at Yugoslavia. How can the Soviet bourgeois reformers avoid the lesson of
  Yugoslavia? It is literally staring them in the face.</p>

  <p>Yugoslavia has not only become impoverished but is a scene of fratricidal struggle
  from which only the imperialists can gain. The country as a whole is sinking into
  virtual oblivion.</p>

  <p>What we are seeing now is only one phase of the class struggle. The working class's
  emergence on the political arena is absolutely inevitable. And this is precisely what
  is holding the imperialists back whenever they are prodded by bourgeois academia and
  capitalist politicians in general to advance aid and credits to Gorbachev and
  Yeltsin.</p>
