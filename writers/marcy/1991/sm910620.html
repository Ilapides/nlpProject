  <h1>Jiang Qing and the Cultural Revolution</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (June 20, 1991)</h5>

  <p>The death of Jiang Qing removes the acknowledged leader of the Chinese Cultural
  Revolution, which was inspired by Mao Zedong and was carried out in his name.</p>

  <p>Xinhua news agency, after waiting two weeks, announced she had died on May 14,
  reportedly by her own hand. Her struggle with cancer of the throat and the frailties of
  old age, together with the setbacks for socialism internationally, could not but have
  affected her. She had been detained, first in prison and then under house arrest, ever
  since 1977 when the leaders of the Cultural Revolution were jailed just one month after
  Mao's death.</p>

  <p>How did Jiang Qing come to be so closely identified with the Cultural Revolution
  that began in 1966?</p>

  <h4>A cultural rebel</h4>

  <p>Jiang Qing was born in March 1914 into a poor family in Chucheng County, Shantung
  Province. When she was 15, her parents tried to marry her off to a rich merchant. She
  resisted and eventually was placed in the care of the county government, which sent her
  to an opera school in Tsinan. While there, she made contact with the Communist Party.
  She then made her way to Shanghai, where she joined a repertory company.</p>

  <p>The theater had become the vehicle for a progressive struggle against feudal
  reaction and imperialist aggression, and was viewed with scorn and hypocrisy by the
  conservative elements. Eventually she left Shanghai for the long and tortuous road to
  Yanan, where the Communists had their headquarters.</p>

  <p>The capitalist media depict her as nothing but a spiteful and power-hungry woman who
  took advantage of the position of her husband, Mao Zedong. This crude recourse to
  sexist stereotyping seeks to eradicate her long revolutionary history, particularly in
  the field of culture.</p>

  <p>Jiang Qing didn't come out of the blue as a leader of the Cultural Revolution. She
  was part of a continuum of great cultural personalities who challenged the views of the
  old order. She was influenced by several generations of writers and artists who
  prepared the masses for struggle.</p>

  <p>One of the outstanding personalities who preceded and must have influenced her was
  Chen Tu-Hsiu. He was a writer who boldly attacked feudal culture and propagated Western
  democracy and science. His efforts had great influence in cultural circles. He called
  on young Chinese to abandon passive, conservative thought and instead adopt a
  forward-looking, progressive and scientific outlook. He opposed the feudal autocracy
  and warlord rule and aimed at seeing China built into a bourgeois democratic state.</p>

  <p>Chen Tu-Hsiu was reluctant, however, to mobilize the broad mass of the people to
  participate in revolution. He entertained the illusion that a bourgeois democratic
  government would be founded in China without any class struggles.</p>

  <p>Lu Hsun (1891-1936), another strong influence on Jiang Qing's generation, was an
  outstanding writer of the 20th century school of realism. Before the outbreak of the
  1911 revolution he joined the bourgeois revolutionary movement led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen.
  In 1918 he published "A Madman's Diary," the first modern Chinese short story, in which
  he attacked the feudal social system. Lu Hsun pointed out that several thousand years
  of feudal society were but a history of savage repression on the part of the ruling
  classes. He called on the people to rise against the system. Lu Hsun's militant
  campaign played an important role in waking the Chinese people.</p>

  <p>Li Ta-Chao, another leader of the cultural movement, put forward a thoroughly
  revolutionary program, crying out for an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle. Li
  emphasized that imperialism was the deadly enemy of the people all over the world. A
  genuine democratic government could never be won unless and until imperialist rule was
  overthrown. He was the first to link the anti-imperialist struggle with the struggle
  against feudalism.</p>

  <p>Jiang Qing was undoubtedly influenced by this flowering of revolutionary culture
  beginning with the 1911 revolution. There is no question that she tried through her own
  art medium, the theater, to do what Chen Tu-Hsiu, Lu Hsun and Li Ta-Chao had attempted
  earlier.</p>

  <p>They were mainly literary figures. Jiang Qing was a political leader. They
  articulated the struggle against feudalism and to a limited extent against imperialism.
  She espoused the revolutionary reconstruction of feudal and bourgeois society.</p>

  <p>These great personalities prepared the minds of the people for the revolution in the
  same way that St. Simon, Fourier, Voltaire and Rousseau had prepared the way for the
  French Revolution.</p>

  <p>In Shanghai, Jiang Qing must have been absorbed in the great events convulsing that
  proletarian center. She learned of the revolutionary rebellions led earlier by the Yi
  Ho Tuan, called the "Boxers" in the West. The Yi Ho Tuan was a secret society organized
  against the Manchu Dynasty. The great bulk of its participants were peasants and
  handicraftsmen, active in Shantung, her native province.</p>

  <p>The Yi Ho Tuan get little more than a footnote in contemporary U.S. history books.
  But the so-called Boxer Rebellion of 1900 must have had a profound influence on Jiang
  Qing and her contemporaries. We should recall how the Yi Ho Tuan were defeated and by
  whom.</p>

  <p><em>The Outline History of China</em> (Tung Chi-Ming, Foreign Language Press,
  Beijing, 1959) gives this description:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Britain, the United States, Japan, Germany, czarist Russia, France, Italy and
    Austria combined to organize a force of 30,000 to advance toward Beijing."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Aren't these the same forces that just invaded Iraq?</p>

  <blockquote>
    The combined forces of the eight imperialist powers reached Beijing where they met
    with the strongest resistance of the Yi Ho Tuan. After a few days of fierce street
    fighting, however, the city was lost to the enemy.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Superior fire power, more developed technology.</p>

  <blockquote>
    On their way from Tientsin to Beijing, the imperialist soldiers committed
    atrocities of every description &mdash; massacre, rape, arson and plunder. Many
    villages along their line of advance were rendered to ruin. After they entered
    Beijing, they perpetrated the most shameless plunder of modern history. They not only
    pillaged, but made the victims transport the spoils. ...<br /><br />
	They set fire to every building which was known to have been used by the Yi Ho
    Tuan. They killed every person suspected of being a Yi Ho Tuan follower. On one
    occasion a group of refugees were herded into a blind alley and machine-gunned.
  </blockquote>

  <p>How different is this from the pillage, plunder and destruction of Iraq? High
  technology, telecommunications and rapid means of transportation have not added to the
  "civilizing" role of the imperialists, but have made them more brutal, more cruel and
  devoid of any kind of human sentiment except hypocrisy.</p>

  <p>The Japanese invasion of China in 1931, the sacking and burning of Shanghai, the
  wanton killing of hundreds of thousands, multiplied the earlier aggression of the
  imperialists a hundredfold. An unmitigated hatred of the imperialist oppressors and
  their native collaborators would well up in any revolutionary of that time.</p>

  <p>Jiang Qing was a product of these great upheavals. Born the same year as the
  outbreak of the First World War, a child during the Russian Revolution, she was still a
  teenager at the time of the Japanese invasion.</p>

  <p>When the imperialists and the reactionaries speak of Jiang Qing as the most hated
  woman in China, they are merely venting their own hatred of a revolutionary. They pour
  their venom upon her precisely because she was an unflinching and devoted adherent of
  the cause of revolutionary communism.</p>

  <h4>China after liberation</h4>

  <p>By 1949, the Peoples Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party had
  not only defeated Japanese imperialism but ousted the pro-imperialist forces of Chiang
  Kai-shek. Mao Zedong became the leader of the country. What was the social situation in
  China after liberation?</p>

  <p>It is not by accident that China called itself a people's republic rather than a
  socialist one, like the USSR. True, the military victory over Chiang's armies laid the
  economic foundation for socialism in that the means of production were taken over by
  the new people's government. Also, the land was distributed to the peasants. However,
  that is a far cry from the socialist collectivism which later characterized the
  communes in China.</p>

  <p>Much of the property of the bourgeoisie, especially the middle or petty bourgeoisie,
  was not expropriated. Commodity production, especially in consumer goods and
  foodstuffs, continued. Of the bourgeoisie whose property was taken over, many were
  compensated by the government.</p>

  <p>This first phase of the Chinese Revolution was thoroughly anti-feudal and
  anti-imperialist, but it did not usher in a deepgoing socialist transformation, which
  was the aim of the leaders at a later period. Many of the bourgeoisie who supported the
  struggle against foreign domination and opposed feudalism were not necessarily
  pro-socialist.</p>

  <p>A variety of different and even antagonistic social and political currents all
  supported the people's government in the early stages. The critical issue was whether
  the Communist Party and its leading cadres could carry these divergent groupings along
  with them in the socialist phase of the revolution.</p>

  <p>Thus, for a period of time, there was confusion both at home and abroad as to the
  class character of the new Chinese state. Some contended, especially in the U.S., that
  this was primarily a peasant revolution, like so many earlier uprisings which had
  failed to transform the social order and had ultimately settled down to the same old
  system where the peasants were exploited by a new dynastic group.</p>

  <p>How different really was the Peoples Liberation Army? Wasn't it overwhelmingly
  peasant? And didn't the Communist Party, which commanded millions of supporters, have a
  narrow base in the proletariat, itself only a tiny minority of the population? Wouldn't
  history repeat itself?</p>

  <p>The example was given of Li Tse-cheng, the famous peasant leader whose army swept
  through Chensi, Kansu and Honan provinces. It ultimately reached Beijing itself in 1640
  and overthrew the Ming Dynasty. His peasant army had a brilliant and unprecedented
  victory and tried to live up to its slogan of equal distribution of the land among the
  poor and the rich. But the old social system reasserted itself.</p>

  <p>A formidable faction in the U.S. State Department, led ideologically by Owen
  Lattimore, contended in the early fifties that the U.S. should forget about the Chiang
  Kai-shek regime and recognize the Chinese Communists because they were qualitatively
  different from the Soviet government, despite their close connections.</p>

  <p>Among progressives abroad the same question was raised. Was this a real communist
  revolution? Or would it turn out to be a mere agrarian revolution and adapt itself to
  the bourgeois mode of production?</p>

  <h4>Second phase of the revolution</h4>

  <p>To the Chinese Communists, it was plain that China needed a second phase of its
  revolution. It needed to technologically modernize its plant and equipment, the means
  of communication and transport, all the vital arteries of economic life. The only way
  this could be done without falling under the domination of the imperialist monopolies
  was through a centrally organized socialist transformation that called on the energies
  of the masses.</p>

  <p>However, the party apparatus became weakened and by the 1960s was in many areas the
  fortress of the rightist forces, led by Shao Qui and Deng Xiaoping. Mao virtually lost
  his organizational hold on the party apparatus. Difficult economic times divided the
  party leaders on which course China should choose &mdash; forward with socialist
  construction and the elimination of the bourgeoisie and their supporters, or backward
  toward a capitalist mode of production.</p>

  <p>No grouping in the party could openly embrace the second route. The party leadership
  was bound by unanimous decisions. There was no open debate on which road China should
  take. However, the denunciation of Stalin by Khrushchev in 1956 and the abandonment of
  his course in the USSR had opened the way for strengthening the rightwing in the
  Chinese party. The Cultural Revolution went outside the party apparatus to directly
  mobilize the masses for the class struggle.</p>

  <h4>Eastern Europe's `people's democracies'</h4>

  <p>In Eastern Europe, the new states which emerged after World War II were called
  people's democracies, not socialist republics like the USSR. In reality the
  revolutionary transformation of society went only halfway. The means of production were
  nationalized and agriculture was collectivized to some extent. But there is more to a
  socialist revolution than the seizure of the means of production from the
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>There was no spontaneous revolutionary uprising of the masses such as happened in
  Russia, China and Cuba. The socialist transformations were carried out under the aegis
  of the Soviet Union after its victory over the fascist forces. While they were
  certainly progressive and, from a class point of view, even revolutionary, they were
  not wholly the work of the masses themselves. Eastern Europe was a halfway house
  between bourgeois society and socialist economic achievements. Retreat followed upon
  retreat.</p>

  <p>The exception of course was Yugoslavia, where a socialist revolution was
  accomplished independently of the Soviet army. The landlords and bourgeoisie were
  overthrown by the Partisan movement led by Tito and the Communist Party. Yugoslavia's
  subsequent degeneration is another story.</p>

  <h4>A struggle to narrow gap between rich and poor</h4>

  <p>In China, by the time of the Cultural Revolution, the gap between rich and poor and
  the growth of privileges and emoluments for those in positions of authority was
  becoming so enormous that it fed a bourgeois restoration movement, certainly in the
  field of consumption. The leaders of the Cultural Revolution were fighting against this
  ever-widening gap between the mass of the population and those on top.</p>

  <p>The duty of the party, according to the Cultural Revolution leaders, was to narrow
  the gap to the extent possible. The struggle once again reduced itself to what had
  existed in so many periods before: a struggle between rich and poor.</p>

  <p>To use a historical analogy, the Cultural Revolution was the Jacobin phase of the
  Chinese Revolution. The Jacobins were the most far-reaching revolutionaries in the
  French Revolution of 1789, which overthrew the monarchy and established a bourgeois
  republic. Their heroism &mdash; in the eyes of the bourgeoisie, their sin &mdash; was
  that they tried to carry the French Revolution beyond the needs of the development of
  the emerging capitalist system. They fought in the interests of the artisans and poor
  of the cities, who were really the proletariat in its very early infancy.</p>

  <p>Objectively, the role of the Jacobins was that they pushed the revolution far enough
  to at least ensure that when the moderates took over in the period of reaction, the
  political situation was stabilized with a new ruling class &mdash; the bourgeoisie
  &mdash; in place of the feudal aristocracy.</p>

  <p>The Jacobins led the campaign of revolutionary terror against the rightwing
  Girondists. The revolution went through many zigzags. The culmination of its leftward
  course was the Commune of Paris and the establishment of the Committees of Public
  Safety, the eyes and ears of the revolution. But all this could not stop the march of
  the bourgeoisie to power. Thermidor, the month in which the reaction triumphed, was
  inevitable.</p>

  <p>Was the Chinese Revolution fated to follow in the footsteps of this earlier
  brilliant social transformation? That is the question.</p>

  <h4>`A proletarian political revolution'</h4>

  <p>How did the proponents of the Cultural Revolution explain its significance? "The
  Great Cultural Revolution is a proletarian political revolution as well as a
  continuation of the civil war and a continuation of the class struggle between the
  Kuomintang and the Communist Party" was the way K'ang Sheng, one of the leaders of the
  Cultural Revolution, put it. (From the book <em>Comrade Chiang Ching,</em> by Roxanne
  Witke, Little, Brown &amp; Co., New York, 1977.)</p>

  <p>There is no question that this is the very essence of the Cultural Revolution.</p>

  <p>What were the sins of the Cultural Revolution? The book <em>China's Socialist
  Modernization</em> (ed. by Yu Guangyuan, Foreign Languages Press, Beijing, 1984, p. 17)
  states, "The Gang of Four opposed the growth of the productive forces, attacking the
  four modernizations as turning to capitalism, and slandering measures to improve the
  material and cultural life of the people as `revisionist.' They objected to the
  principle of `to each according to his work,' business accounting, and aspects of
  socialist relations of production that basically correspond with the development of
  productive forces. They encouraged the reactionary egalitarianism, the theory which
  actually asserts that extravagance is justified, and they advocated a transfer to
  `communism' on the conditions where the level of the productive forces was very
  low."</p>

  <p>But this is a falsehood. They were for the modernization of the means of production,
  but opposed taking the capitalist road to achieve this.</p>

  <p>In order to understand the issue of payment according to work, one must take into
  account Karl Marx's criticism of the Gotha Program. The program was an attempt to
  describe communist society, and was written in 1875 for a Congress of the German
  Workers' Party. In his <em>Critique of the Gotha Program,</em> Marx stressed that in
  between capitalism and communism there would be a lengthy transition period
  characterized by the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. In this first phase
  of communism, bourgeois norms would still prevail and payment, or the distribution of
  the social product, would be determined by the slogan "from each according to his [her]
  ability, to each according to his [her] work."</p>

  <p>Only in the second phase of communism could distribution be "from each according to
  his [her] ability, to each according to his [her] needs."</p>

  <p>Communist society proper would be achieved once the development of the productive
  forces had been raised to the point where bourgeois norms were no longer necessary and
  there would be such an abundance of the products of labor that each could take from the
  fund of consumption whatever her/his needs might be.</p>

  <p>Were Mao and the leaders of the Cultural Revolution guilty of trying to skip over
  this first stage? No, they did not deny or even attempt to modify Marx's conception of
  these two stages in the development of communism. Nor did they challenge the validity
  of a lengthy transition period which could only advance through the revolutionary
  dictatorship of the proletariat (in China in alliance with the peasantry).</p>

  <p>But it was otherwise with those who came after Mao. Contrary to the book on China's
  modernization quoted above, Marx never said that payment according to one's work is a
  principle. It's not a principle. No one called it a principle in Marx or Lenin's time
  &mdash; certainly not in the most important works on this question, Marx's <em>Critique
  of the Gotha Program</em> and Lenin's <em>State and Revolution.</em> Actually, it was
  Stalin who converted this statement, which is perfectly correct and sensible when
  applied to the first stage of communism, into an eternal verity.</p>

  <p>Distribution according to work is a necessity in a society recently emerged from
  capitalism, with all the accompanying birthmarks. But it is certainly inadequate, since
  human needs and abilities may differ substantially. Should someone with a disabling
  condition be paid only according to their work? How are different types of work to be
  remunerated?</p>

  <p>The Cultural Revolution leaders, while they raised these questions, did not
  encourage "reactionary egalitarianism," despite what is said today. Petty bourgeois
  egalitarianism was denounced by the leaders of the Cultural Revolution. What the
  bourgeois elements regard as egalitarianism was the struggle against rank
  privilege.</p>

  <p>We see the same kind of accusation raised in the USSR. During the first years of the
  Gorbachev administration, then-Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov opened the struggle for
  bourgeois market reforms with a campaign against supposed "levelers" in the working
  class. This was really a struggle against the workers who were increasingly angry over
  the enormous differentials in pay between workers and the upper crust &mdash; the
  privileged stratum of managers, enterprise chiefs, and the like.</p>

  <p>The idea of egalitarianism originated during the 18th century among the petty
  bourgeois idealist philosophers. It was a reflection of the economic laws which
  regulate the exchange of commodities according to the roughly equal amounts of socially
  necessary labor incorporated in a commodity.</p>

  <p>"Reactionary egalitarianism," if such a thing exists, is not a perspective of the
  working class.</p>

  <p>How do things stand in China today? The same powers that invaded China, that carried
  out the Opium Wars, that crushed the Yi Ho Tuan, that threatened China with nuclear war
  in the 1950s, that kept it out of the UN for 25 years &mdash; they are all still united
  against China. China is still a besieged country, from the western border of Tibet to
  Tienanmen Square.</p>

  <p>It is the duty of the world proletariat, and particularly the advanced workers in
  the United States, to give unconditional support to China in its struggle against
  imperialism. The enduring objective of imperialism, pursued regardless of which
  political grouping is at the helm in Beijing, is to undermine, destroy or reduce this
  great country of 1.1 billion people to a neocolonial status.</p>
