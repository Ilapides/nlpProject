  <h1>The new crisis in the USSR: Part 2</h1>

  <h2>State structure and nationality</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (May 23, 1991)</h5>

  <p><em>This document is written as a contribution to pre-conference discussion in
  preparation for the Workers World Party Conference on June 1.</em></p>

  <p>May 14 &mdash; It should now be clear as daylight that the secret meeting on April
  23 between the Gorbachev (bourgeois centrist) grouping and the Yeltsin (bourgeois
  restorationist) grouping in the USSR constitutes the formation of a virtual coalition.
  It is fraught with the greatest possible dangers for the socialist foundations of the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it could well decide the destiny of the USSR. As each day goes by, the
  restorationists become bolder while the centrists are in steady and continuous retreat.
  The danger of a bourgeois restorationist cold takeover, with Yeltsin at the head,
  becomes a distinct possibility.</p>

  <p>Every day brings more grist to the mill of the counter-revolutionaries. President
  Mikhail Gorbachev has just humiliated himself by requesting another $1.5 billion in
  credits from the U.S. government to relieve the acute food crisis in the USSR &mdash;
  which was brought on by his own bourgeois reforms.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev appeals to Murdoch</h4>

  <p>Gorbachev, in an interview with Rupert Murdoch, the reactionary multi-billionaire
  owner of many publications, pleaded with the U.S. government to disregard the extreme
  right-wingers in its fold who oppose all measures to ameliorate the chaotic conditions
  in the USSR. Excerpts from the interview appeared in the May 12 Sunday Times of
  London.</p>

  <p>"We are on the verge of chaos," he told Murdoch, forgetting that this is music to
  the ears of the imperialist bourgeoisie. And why is this happening? His answer is
  enormously illuminating. "Because we are abandoning the command economy."</p>

  <p>This admission says it all! Gorbachev has been insisting for years that the "command
  economy," that is, centralized planning, was responsible for the deteriorating economic
  situation. But now, for the very first time, he has let the cat out of the bag. It is
  actually the <strong>abandonment</strong> of planning that has brought things to the
  point of utter chaos!</p>

  <p>Gorbachev told Murdoch in detail about the difficulties of trying to transform a
  socialist system into a capitalist one. At the same time, however, he refused to
  categorically state that he is for privatization of all the means of production. Still
  the centrist, he clings to his formula of transforming the USSR into a market economy
  while presumably maintaining some state ownership.</p>

  <p>Relief is what he needs at the present moment, in the form of grain and food
  products, and this is precisely what the White House and the Congress are holding back
  on.</p>

  <p>Extending a billion-and-a-half dollars of credit to a country which only a few years
  ago was the most credit-worthy in the world seems to be a huge problem for the White
  House hard liners and the most reactionary elements in the Congress. But the billion
  and a half is really a piddling sum considering the magnitude of the Soviet Union's
  natural resources, especially when one remembers that it is the world's largest
  producer of gold.</p>

  <p>The U.S. administration is holding back on the money and instead is sending a team
  of "experts" to assess the situation &mdash; i.e., to determine how best to wreck the
  socialist forms of distribution in agriculture and food production in favor of market
  forms. Only then, if at all, will they agree to the loan.</p>

  <p>It should be added that extremely bad weather has deepened the food and agricultural
  problem. Heavy rains last fall in the Ukraine devastated the 1990 harvest. The fields
  were so muddy that farmers were unable to harvest enough seeds for spring planting or
  prepare plots for sowing. Desperate farmers in the Tula region, 100 miles south of
  Moscow, gathered potatoes for seed by hand but still were forced to import 1,000 tons
  of seed potatoes from the Netherlands and 7,000 tons from Germany. (U.S. News and World
  Report, May 13, 1991.)</p>

  <p>The bad weather may be a mitigating circumstance that explains more fully the nature
  of the current shortages, but it is the political crisis that is of the greatest
  importance.</p>

  <h4>Right-center coalition meets in secrecy</h4>

  <p>What has brought on this virtual coalition between the Yeltsin and Gorbachev
  groupings? Why was it necessary? We discussed in the last issue how this coalition was
  arrived at in dead secret, in gross violation of both the so-called spirit and letter
  of glasnost. Indeed, it was done completely behind the backs of the people, without
  consultation, without admitting the press, radio or television.</p>

  <p>Yet no one in the bourgeois world seems to regard the meeting as anything but a
  great achievement for them. Doesn't this make absolutely clear what they mean by
  democracy? They mean bourgeois democracy, democracy that serves the ends of the
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>If this secret meeting had achieved something for socialism, for the strengthening
  of the socialist aspects of the Soviet regime, they would have regarded it as a crime
  against democracy. As it is, the opposite is true.</p>

  <p>But let's first of all address the question of its legality. On March 25, the people
  of the USSR had voted on a referendum to sustain the union treaty governing all the
  republics of the USSR. It was overwhelmingly approved by a huge majority.</p>

  <p>The referendum widened the economic authority of the republics, strengthening
  centrifugal forces whose objective is to wreck centralized planning. At the same time,
  however, it retained the Soviet Union as a unitary state, as a union of all the
  republics on a federated basis. That should have settled the matter, at least for the
  time being, of the relationship between the centrifugal forces of nationality vs. the
  crying need for economic coordination and socialist planning. For only through a
  correct balance between the two, arrived at by compromises here and there over a period
  of time, can socialist construction proceed on the basis of public ownership of the
  means of production and socialist planning.</p>

  <p>But then, on April 23, came the meeting of this coalition that enlarged the power
  and particularly the economic independence of the republics. The secret meeting was
  held between Gorbachev and the leaders of nine of the republics &mdash; the Russian
  federated republic (headed by Boris Yeltsin), Azerbaijan, Byelorussia, Kazakhstan,
  Kirghizia, Tadzhikistan, Turkmenia, the Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.</p>

  <p>It was a triumph for the pro-restorationist forces headed by Yeltsin, who has now
  suddenly found in Gorbachev an "ally" with a human face. (New York Times, May 12.)</p>

  <p>Six other republics &mdash; the Baltic states, Georgia, Armenia and Moldavia &mdash;
  were either not invited to this meeting or declined to go. It's not clear which. It is
  wrong, however, to regard them as being outside the jurisdiction of the USSR or to
  assume that they've already gone on the road to secession.</p>

  <h4>Self-determination and secession</h4>

  <p>It is, of course, the right of each individual republic to secede. This is
  guaranteed by the succeeding constitutions of the USSR and buttressed by the writings
  of Lenin over a period of years. However, self-determination has to be considered in
  the light of the concrete circumstances of each historical period. Self-determination
  cannot be routinely applied as an abstract universal formula.</p>

  <p>For instance, Lenin many times referred to the question of the separation of Norway
  from Sweden as having aided the class solidarity of the workers, because it broke down
  the animosity between the Swedish and Norwegian workers and laid the basis for
  collaboration between them.</p>

  <p>But what about the secession of the Baltic states in the context of the contemporary
  world struggle? It is being instigated by imperialist militarism, which seeks to use
  every possible inch of territory on the globe to feed its insatiable appetite for
  aggression and superprofits. How could that kind of secession aid the class solidarity
  of the workers? In fact, it could do great harm to the cause of socialism in general
  and become a dagger pointed at the heart of the USSR.</p>

  <p>How fraudulent that Yeltsin, with his usual double-talk, has become the spokesperson
  for Baltic "independence"! The Russian republic which he heads is the main generator of
  national animosities, with its legacy of Great Russian chauvinism.</p>

  <h4>Rights of nationalities vs. states</h4>

  <p>Let us examine the propriety of this meeting from the point of view of jurisdiction
  &mdash; whether a meeting by the heads of the nine republics is the proper forum for
  the task described in their accord as "resolving the inter-ethnic strife." This was a
  meeting of <strong>heads of states</strong>. The Ukraine, Kazakhstan or the Russian
  Federation, for example, are states within the framework of the Union of Soviet
  Socialist Republics. Inter-ethnic conflicts are nationality conflicts, conflicts
  between nations, nationalities or ethnic groupings. These groupings are not necessarily
  identical with the states which supposedly represent them.</p>

  <p>There's a fundamental difference between a particular nationality or ethnic grouping
  and the state or republic structure which politically represents it. The state may not
  altogether represent the nationality. A state like the Russian Federation has quite a
  number of nationalities and ethnic groups. There are scores of nationalities, or ethnic
  groupings if you will, in the Soviet Union. But there are only 15 republics.</p>

  <p>For years during the Lenin period the party worked to bring to the fore a new form
  of government for the workers' state, a bicameral instead of unicameral constitutional
  structure.</p>

  <p><em>USSR: 60 Years of the Revolution, 1922-1982</em> (Moscow: Progress Publishers,
  1982) describes the state structure as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    The 1924 Constitution of the USSR established that the Central Executive Committee of
    the USSR, which was the supreme body of the union between the USSR Congresses of
    Soviets, should consist of two chambers &mdash; the Soviet of the Union and the
    Soviet of Nationalities.<br /><br />
	The Soviet of the Union was elected by the Congress of Soviets of the USSR from
    representatives of the union republics in proportion to their population. The Soviet
    of Nationalities was formed of representatives of the union and autonomous republics
    and autonomous regions on the basis of five representatives from each union republic,
    five representatives from each autonomous republic, and one representative from each
    autonomous region. The composition of the Soviet of Nationalities as a whole was
    approved by the Congress of Soviets.<br /><br />
	The establishment of the Soviet of Nationalities was an important guarantee for
    ensuring the interests of the union and autonomous republics, and subsequently
    autonomous areas. ...
  </blockquote>

  <p>The whole purpose of this was to see that national and ethnic representation was
  carried out to its fullest extent. The attention paid by the USSR to the nationalities
  is indicated by the fact that in 1982 "books and booklets are published in 89
  indigenous languages of the USSR."</p>

  <p>(Today, according to Gorbachev himself, there are 100 published languages and 120
  different peoples.)</p>

  <p>The Soviet Union may have more nationalities within its geographical confines than
  any other state, with the possible exception of India. One of the characteristic
  features of the USSR, which has always puzzled the imperialist scholars of the Soviet
  Union, is how in the world the Soviet regime, beginning with Lenin and up to the
  Gorbachev era, was able to maintain a relatively peaceful relationship among the
  nationalities.</p>

  <p>To be sure, there was repression during the Stalin era, but no one in the
  imperialist press was able to uncover the kind of large-scale strife which is now
  reaching the point where, as this coalition says, it is "tearing society asunder."</p>

  <p>But it's not just "society" in general that is being torn apart. It's the social
  system in the USSR, the workers' state. And it's not because of the inter-ethnic
  strife. It is the stimulus of bourgeois property which has divided the whole country
  and has revived ancient antagonisms. The inter-ethnic strife is the effect, not the
  cause, of the growing dismemberment of the USSR. The fundamental cause of the struggle
  is the growth of the bourgeoisie and its attempt to win domination over the workers and
  peasants.</p>

  <p>The first rebellion over national oppression, it should be recalled, came back in
  December 1986 when fighting broke out in Alma-Ata, in Kazakhstan, after the removal of
  the First Secretary of the Kazakh Communist Party, Dinmukhamed A. Kunayev, and his
  replacement by an ethnic Russian. He was the first of many party leaders and government
  officials in the southern republics said to be removed for corruption, but whose
  replacement by Gorbachev perestroika promoters inflamed the local population.</p>

  <p>The bicameral legislature in the USSR, comprising the Soviet of the Union and the
  Soviet of Nationalities, differs from the bicameral form prevalent in the bourgeois
  states. Britain has its House of Lords and House of Commons. In the United States,
  there's the House of Representatives and the Senate. This is not the time to critically
  review these forms of bourgeois state. Suffice it to say that the Soviet Union, while
  it achieved a bicameral form of government where the widest possible latitude was given
  to universal suffrage, at the same time gave clear and unambiguous recognition to the
  existence of various nationalities and also to the oppression they have faced for
  centuries. The Soviet of Nationalities was their forum to not only express and discuss
  problems and solutions but also to have legislative power along with the Soviet of the
  Union.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev, Yeltsin blame nationalities for strife</h4>

  <p>Clearly, when a problem arises that has to do with the nationalities or with
  inter-ethnic strife, the place for it to be raised and resolved is in the Soviet of
  Nationalities. But here, in this secret meeting, the two groupings together with the
  nine republics not only took it upon themselves to raise the question of inter-ethnic
  relations but put the blame for the strife on the nationalities.</p>

  <p>In other words, these <em>republics,</em> which have many nationalities in them, put
  the blame on the nationalities rather than on the republics themselves. They made the
  republics synonymous with the nationalities. But the Russian Republic, for instance, is
  a federation of nationalities. Which among them authorized Yeltsin to speak and
  legislate for them? Can the other heads of the republics speak for all their
  nationalities?</p>

  <p>The meeting of these republics meant to convey the political notion that the
  representatives of the particular republics are identical with representation for the
  nationalities in their republics. That's a false position, especially in a country with
  so many nationalities.</p>

  <p>It's like saying that the governors of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana or New York
  have identical interests to the nationalities &mdash; Black, Latino, Asian &mdash; in
  those states. That's a very tall assumption. In the USSR, the Soviet of Nationalities
  was formed precisely because it was improper to leave the solution of this question to
  the republics alone. It could only be done in collaboration with the other chamber, the
  Soviet of Nationalities. The 15 republics alone could not adequately deal with it. The
  head of a republic in Georgia might be a Georgian but not necessarily an Ossetian or
  some other nationality residing in Georgia.</p>

  <p>The Soviet of Nationalities was one of the truly great achievements of the Soviet
  Union. It was made possible by the revolution and it took years of hard work to develop
  it amidst a growing political differentiation in the Soviet Communist Party into right,
  left and center groupings. Nevertheless, the party was in unanimous agreement on the
  bicameral form of the Soviet state and approved in particular the Soviet of
  Nationalities.</p>

  <h4>Where will money come from for transition to market economy?</h4>

  <p>The big problem that faces both the Gorbachev grouping and the outright
  restorationists if they are to realize their schemes of a restructured society is how
  to find an easy transition. As Gorbachev tells it to Murdoch, he wants a "mixed economy
  with elements of small ownership and trade." He will allow some private ownership of
  the means of production, but only on a small scale.</p>

  <p>"People do not want to work in a factory," Gorbachev protests, "whose owner has
  accumulated money in some unknown [also translated as dubious] way. Privatization
  should give people a share, a lease maybe, membership of a cooperative in their
  factories. Small private properties might be allowed in trade." In short, it is the
  good old middle way.</p>

  <p>How can there be an easy transition? Maybe if the giant multinational corporations
  were lining up, desperately seeking to purchase or to immediately invest huge sums of
  money into the Soviet economy. But this is not happening. With all the privatization
  that is going on, with all the damage that has been done to the collective farm system,
  the basic social and economic infrastructure established over a 70-year period is still
  there, although in damaged form.</p>

  <p>The ideal situation for the centrists and even more for the restorationists would be
  if there were enough domestic buyers from the new bourgeoisie to purchase the means of
  production. If legislation could be passed that clearly allowed the state to sell its
  properties outright and let individuals sell, resell and pass the property on to their
  heirs, that would considerably ease the process of transforming the socialized economy
  into a ruthless, exploitive capitalist system.</p>

  <p>But those who may have the cash for the purchase of huge mines, mills, factories
  &mdash; the entire productive apparatus of the USSR including the huge
  military-industrial complex &mdash; are loathe to disclose it. Fear of the workers
  restrains their eagerness to obtain the fruits of privatization.</p>

  <p>So they have all hit upon the idea that the Soviet state should make loans available
  to prospective purchasers for the purpose of privatization. In other words, they want
  the workers' state to subsidize the bourgeoisie. That certainly would be an easy
  transition, could it be accomplished.</p>

  <p>The restorationists are stymied by the fact that not only the workers but the
  peasants and the public in general are opposed to such an idea. Besides, to whom will
  the money be loaned? And how can the Soviet state extend such huge loans at a time when
  it faces a huge deficit that is daily being increased, precisely because of the type of
  chaos that the Gorbachev regime has inflicted upon the people?</p>

  <p>The loans would have to be extraordinarily huge to facilitate the sale of the basic
  means of production, and would quickly create an unparalleled wave of hyperinflation of
  the type that prevailed in the years before the Soviet government established a planned
  economy and stabilized the currency.</p>

  <p>Inflation would devalue the ruble and curtail such foreign trade as is now
  possible.</p>

  <h4>The real "command economy"</h4>

  <p>Blaming everything on the "command economy," Gorbachev leaves himself blameless. At
  the same time, he gives a plug for the capitalist economy. The broad public in the
  Soviet Union is now told that capitalism is not a command economy. But what kind of
  economy is practiced by, for instance, General Motors? Who decides how many cars should
  be built, of what style, and where markets should be sought? Is it the workers? Is it
  the foremen and -women at the factory? Is it the hundreds and hundreds of middle
  managers? Is it even the so-called broad sector of stock holders, numbering perhaps in
  the hundreds of thousands? But their votes are controlled by a handful of financial
  institutions and banks as well as a few people on the board of directors. These in turn
  generally hand over the basic authority to the CEO and chairman of the board, whose
  close association with the banks is what usually explains their rise to authority.</p>

  <p>Is General Electric or any other big capitalist corporation run any differently than
  General Motors?</p>

  <p>Why put over such a big fraud about the "command economy" and contrast it to the
  "democracy" of big capital, which is in reality a plutocracy of bankers and
  industrialists where command is the key word?</p>

  <p>The arbitrary system of planning in the Soviet Union needed only to be democratized,
  made less rigid, with greater participation and more freedom from political control,
  but within the same socialist system.</p>

  <p>The free market isn't free under today's capitalism. Take milk, one of the most
  basic necessities. New York State regulates the production of milk in order to keep the
  price high on the "free" market. Farmers all over the U.S. just two years ago were
  ordered to kill vast heards of cows so the price of milk would be kept high on the
  "free" market. It is only the private ownership of the means of production which is
  unlimited. Three or four dozen families control the bulk of the economic arteries of
  the U.S.</p>

  <p>The gap between rich and poor in the U.S. grows ever wider because of the enormous
  concentration of power in ever fewer hands. The income of the top 1% of the population
  now exceeds that of the bottom 40%. To maintain this, a strong capitalist state is
  necessary. But our "communist" president in the USSR tells the publishing lord, Rupert
  Murdoch, "Maybe the U.S. feels it does not need a strong Soviet Union. But we feel we
  need a strong United States. It is the guiding axis of international relations. We see
  attempts in America to destroy it, but we must not allow it to happen."</p>

  <p>However one may attempt to analyze the internal developments in the USSR, it is
  impossible to get a comprehensive view of them except in the context of the present
  world situation. It is this aspect we intend to address next week.</p>
