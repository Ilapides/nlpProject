  <h1>Understanding the Shevardnadze bombshell</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Jan. 3, 1991)</h5>

  <p>The sudden resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on Dec. 20
  constitutes a heavy blow to world imperialism's hopes for the restoration of capitalism
  in the USSR. It also demonstrates the complete bankruptcy of the Gorbachev grouping's
  experiments. These include introducing free (capitalist) marketing, decentralizing
  socialist industry and shifting the national income toward the upper crust of Soviet
  society as against the mass of workers and peasants.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev's bourgeois reforms have widened and deepened class differentiation in the
  USSR. This was not very clear in the early stages of Gorbachev's experimentation when
  it was thought that modernizing industry and increasing national income for all was the
  fundamental objective of his policies.</p>

  <p>However, sabotage of the achievements of socialist construction by the new bourgeois
  strata has made it clear to an ever-wider section of the Soviet people that socialist
  construction is not the basis for the chaos in the country. Rather, the effort to foist
  capitalist enterprise on Soviet society is the culprit.</p>

  <p>The resignation also demonstrated in a most striking way that the progressive forces
  in the country have at last taken the offensive and scored a limited, tentative
  victory. Of course, it is confined thus far to the parliamentary arena. But under the
  given conditions it reflects growing awareness of all sectors of society that the
  Gorbachev reforms have led to an abyss.</p>

  <p>Shevardnadze's departure as foreign minister should first of all be understood in
  light of the international situation, most particularly with regard to the U.S. and the
  growing danger of a U.S. military attack on Iraq.</p>

  <h4>Capitalist reforms brought chaos</h4>

  <p>The imperialists themselves must have known that something was afoot. It is
  impossible that they could not have known that the Gorbachev program was facing an
  acute crisis. Warnings of this have been communicated to the summits of the U.S. ruling
  class all along. But the bourgeois press continued to sing hosannas to the wonders of
  capitalist enterprise in the USSR.</p>

  <p>Then all of a sudden the ruling class seemed to have grasped the full destructive
  impact of the capitalist reforms on the USSR. It must have become clear to them that
  swift emergency measures were necessary to shore up the Gorbachev governing group and
  reinforce the tottering capitalist reforms.</p>

  <p>Thus just a week before Shevardnadze's resignation, the Bush administration &mdash;
  with military-like swiftness entirely uncharacteristic of its usual slow pace with
  regard to financial and economic measures &mdash; suddenly made an announcement.
  Washington said on Dec. 12 that it was not only lifting the U.S. trade ban against the
  USSR but also rushing the USSR's application for membership in the World Bank and the
  International Monetary Fund.</p>

  <p>On the same day it was announced (New York Times, Dec. 13) that simultaneous with
  the offer to grant loans, donations of food were to be made to the USSR &mdash; not
  only from the U.S., but also Britain, Germany, Japan, Israel, Norway, Sweden,
  Switzerland, Austria and Australia.</p>

  <p>Why the sudden rush? Is the food crisis so serious in the USSR? Or is it an
  artificial crisis created by bourgeois speculation and sabotage of the food industry?
  The truth is there's been a bumper crop this year in the USSR.</p>

  <p>The growing realization in the imperialist camp is that Gorbachev's entire program
  of capitalist reforms has reached a crisis point. His entire capitalist restructuring
  program is on the verge of collapse. The five-year tenure of the Gorbachev grouping was
  becoming steadily discredited, having brought nothing but misery, destitution and chaos
  to the mass of the people.</p>

  <h4>Cause or effect?</h4>

  <p>Much more important, the reforms were leading toward a polarization of Soviet
  society into two hostile class camps. The camp of the new bourgeoisie, aided and
  abetted if not instigated and directed by the imperialist monopolies, stands against
  the camp of the working class, the peasants and the progressive intelligentsia.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois press is desperately trying to convey the impression that the
  polarization and fragmentation in the USSR rotates around the so-called independence
  movement in the republics, where so much bloodshed has already been caused. <strong>But
  these struggles are the effect of the viciously divisive economic reforms.</strong>
  These reforms are the principal cause of the struggles of the various nationalities.
  This cannot be emphasized enough since the capitalist press deliberately wants to
  present the issue as simply one between the national government and the nationalities,
  leaving out altogether the underlying cause of the conflict, which began with the
  economic restructuring.</p>

  <p>Confusing cause with effect here distorts the political situation in the USSR beyond
  recognition. If the progressive opposition to the Gorbachev regime is to rally the mass
  of the workers and peasants against the Gorbachev regime, it must first and foremost
  present a comprehensive analysis of the causes of the fratricidal struggle among the
  nationalities and by the nationalities against the center.</p>

  <p>The political crisis resulting from the resignation posed the most acute problem for
  the Gorbachev governing group. It must either move further back toward capitalist
  chaos, or respond to the growing ferment among the workers and peasants in their
  opposition to the bourgeois reforms.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the hurry-up emergency package of food aid, consumer
  products and some high technology was offered by the imperialists against the
  background of two reports. One came from the U.S. government and the other from the
  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Both reports, which were
  in preparation for months, advised against precisely such aid, loans or grants until
  further progress had been made in the implementation of the capitalist reforms. These
  reports demonstrate how far removed these savants of bourgeois economics are from the
  realities of the situation in making the kind of prescription that could set off a
  revolutionary explosion.</p>

  <h4>Allying with imperialism</h4>

  <p>In the meantime, the political crisis was maturing in the most sensitive and most
  urgent area of Soviet foreign relations, in the military field.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev grouping had gone to utterly shameless lengths in allying itself with
  the imperialist powers against Iraq, an oppressed country. One would think it had gone
  the ultimate in discrediting itself in the world anti-imperialist struggle &mdash;
  indeed having renounced it &mdash; and let it go at that.</p>

  <p>But Shevardnadze and presumably Gorbachev himself went a step further and acceded to
  the demands of the Pentagon for more. The Pentagon insisted not only upon the USSR
  going along with the first 10 UN Security Council resolutions. The White House actually
  forced the USSR to co-sponsor the last resolution, which the U.S. had foisted upon the
  UN Security Council, unequivocally authorizing the use of force by Jan. 15 if Iraq does
  not capitulate to the imperialist demands.</p>

  <p>In going to such lengths, Shevardnadze, and of course Gorbachev too, could not but
  raise the specter of a military coup. In light of the Soviet military's reluctance to
  approve any such military collaboration in an attack against a friendly oppressed
  country as Washington and the Pentagon demanded, the possibility of a coup did
  arise.</p>

  <p>It has to be remembered that the Bush administration and the Pentagon had insolently
  gone over the heads of the Soviet government in inviting the Soviet chief of staff,
  Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, to meet with his U.S. counterpart, Gen. Colin Powell, for the
  purpose of coordinating military strategy. The U.S. went over the heads of the Soviet
  government because Gorbachev had shown ambivalence on this question, although had
  repeatedly said he was in favor of negotiation rather than the use of force before the
  Helsinki summit meeting.</p>

  <p>Thus the attempt to reach out to the military over Gorbachev's head. As is well
  known, it boomeranged. The Soviet chief of staff, in a news conference along with
  General Powell, definitively ruled out Soviet military collaboration in an attack. That
  should have ended the matter.</p>

  <h4>Role of Soviet military</h4>

  <p>But Shevardnadze's and Gorbachev's willingness to co-sponsor the shameless UN
  Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force was a challenge to the Soviet
  military and to the Soviet government as a whole, one of the most provocative
  conceivable.</p>

  <p>Instead of backing down, however, the Soviet military deputies opened an attack
  against Shevardnadze. While not enough details have come out, it suffices to say from
  what has been in print in the foreign press that it was of such dimensions as to set
  Shevardnadze back on his heels.</p>

  <p>The attack was led by the Soyuz caucus, particularly Col. Nikolai S. Petrushenko and
  Col. Viktor I. Alksnis. But it is not just the two young colonels. It is a substantial
  section of the progressive military who took up the challenge and forced Shevardnadze's
  resignation.</p>

  <p>As Shevardnadze himself said, their attack was "the last straw" causing him to
  resign.</p>

  <p>The intervention of the Soviet military in foreign policy is a symptom of a broader,
  indeed more acute, political crisis. The crisis stems from the complete bankruptcy of
  the Gorbachev capitalist restructuring of the USSR.</p>

  <p>Even the bourgeois-minded economists of the USSR and some of the more extreme
  right-wing bourgeois deputies found themselves in an impossible situation when their
  own plans proved unworkable. Now some are retreating in utter confusion.</p>

  <p>What does all this show? It shows that despite the ravages of dismantling,
  vandalizing and sabotaging, the socialized economic foundation of the USSR still
  stands. The formidable complex of progressive social, economic and political
  institutions of the USSR &mdash; all based on the collectivized ownership of the means
  of production by the state &mdash; still stands. It is a virtually impregnable fortress
  that cannot be overcome by the marauding bourgeois pro-capitalist, pro-imperialist
  reforms without resort to civil war.</p>

  <p>The effort of the "innovative, imaginative experiments" of the bourgeois
  intelligentsia to usher in a new capitalist era in the USSR has come up against a stone
  wall. The efforts of the new bourgeoisie &mdash; their economists, lawyers, technocrats
  and academicians &mdash; have failed. They have not brought to life the tantalizing
  prospects of capitalist prosperity based upon a free market, dismantling central
  socialist planning and decentralizing socialist industry.</p>

  <p>This failure is especially significant in light of the growing capitalist crisis in
  the U.S., including the S&amp;L scandals and the endangered condition of the biggest
  U.S. banks, including Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and Manufacturers Hanover Trust &mdash;
  which the Soviet press and electronic media are forced to report.</p>

  <h4>Capitalism on socialism like saddle on a cow</h4>

  <p>The attempt to foist a capitalist restructuring plan on the Soviet economy is not
  unlike putting a saddle on a cow. It's a mismatch. It doesn't work.</p>

  <p>Capitalism cannot be introduced solely by decree, intrigue and conspiracy between
  the imperialist bourgeoisie and the governing group in the USSR. It took five long
  years for an authoritative representative of the Gorbachev administration to say all of
  the above in so many words. But Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, chairperson of the internal
  security forces, said all this on Dec. 21. And the fact that he is newly appointed by
  Gorbachev himself gives force and effect to what has been said here above.</p>

  <p>"There are attempts from abroad to exert overt and covert pressure on the Soviet
  Union. ... All these efforts often screen a desire to strengthen not so much us, but
  their own position in our country," Kryuchkov said (New York Times, Dec. 23).</p>

  <p>The bourgeois press, in their report on Kryuchkov's speech, took particular delight
  in repeating over and over that it was after all the head of the "sinister KGB" saying
  all this. And he is reported to have backed down considerably on Dec. 25 under pressure
  from Gorbachev, who appointed him to the post. But that does not change one iota the
  character of the struggle between the bourgeois reformists and the more progressive
  elements in the Congress of Deputies who are fighting against them. At bottom, it is a
  reflection, although in a distorted form, of the struggle between the proletariat and
  its allies, and the new bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Kryuchkov was not the only one saying this. There was a whole string of progressive
  deputies who took the podium at the Congress of People's Deputies who in one form or
  another said the same. What gives Kryuchkov's speech particular force and effect is
  that it is the first time a high official of the Gorbachev administration is saying it.
  And what he is saying is in direct opposition to what Gorbachev has been saying all
  along.</p>

  <h4>Protracted struggle not over</h4>

  <p>It is not so much that Gorbachev is moving to the left as that the forces of
  resistance to the bourgeois reforms have grown sufficiently strong to challenge him.
  Gorbachev's consent to validate workers' control over the food and consumer goods
  industry is recognition of the growing resistance to the capitalist reforms.</p>

  <p>There is now a political situation in which Gorbachev promotes one line &mdash; the
  line of conciliation with capitalist restructuring. The line of resistance is
  enunciated by Colonels Petrushenko and Alksnis and the many thousands of lower level
  grassroots officials who are lending voice to mass dissatisfaction of the millions.
  This situation cannot long continue.</p>

  <p>The Shevardnadze resignation is one episode in a protracted, irreconcilable struggle
  between the bourgeoisie on one side and the proletariat in alliance with the peasantry
  and progressive intelligentsia on the other. On a sociological plane it is a struggle
  between two diametrically opposed social systems &mdash; capitalism and socialism. Such
  a struggle cannot continue for any length of time without a definitive resolution.</p>

  <p>The most hopeful sign in the USSR is that the progressive opposition has finally
  taken the offensive against the Gorbachev administration and forced Shevardnadze's
  resignation. This demonstrates the inherent vitality of the Soviet working class and
  the renewed prospects of a victory of the socialist forces against the capitalist
  marauders.</p>
