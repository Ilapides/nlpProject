  <h1>The slump that won't go away</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Nov. 7, 1991)</h5>

  <p>It must have been a strange performance at the University of Rhode Island Oct. 28.
  Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan not only delivered a grim, downbeat assessment of
  the capitalist economy, but he also criticized the bankers.</p>

  <p>And for good measure he included the bank regulators. Greenspan said both were
  responsible for exacerbating what he called the "credit crunch."</p>

  <p>The chairperson of the Federal Reserve Board rarely makes public appearances. Most
  of them are at Congressional hearings. The spectacle of the Federal Reserve chair
  actually criticizing the bankers was really extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Why was this played so low key in the capitalist press, confined mostly to the
  financial pages?</p>

  <p>The Federal Reserve chair is often referred to as the second most important
  government official after the president. He &mdash; there has never been a woman
  &mdash; is charged with the responsibility of managing and supervising the U.S. banking
  and credit system.</p>

  <p>Alan Greenspan projects an unassuming personality. Historically the head of the
  Federal Reserve has appeared to be a hardline, tight-fisted money manager who
  occasionally bickers with the president or Congress. Both generally demand easier
  credit terms, that is, lower interest rates.</p>

  <p>This is all public posturing. Actually, they decide privately on matters of great
  significance for millions upon millions of workers. And there is no appeal.</p>

  <p>The Federal Reserve chair, like his colleagues on the board, is appointed, not
  elected. This group is chosen from a very, very small portion of the population, mostly
  bankers themselves. Few ordinary workers know who the members of the board are. Even
  most in the middle class only know the name of the chairperson.</p>

  <p>The board's activities are secret, except in times of great and overwhelming
  economic crisis or financial panic. Even then it is rare for public officials,
  particularly members of Congress, to level criticism at the Federal Reserve.</p>

  <p>Criticism from bankers is even rarer. However, their demands are frequently aired to
  the board in no uncertain terms. The chairman is their man.</p>

  <h4>'Easier credit'</h4>

  <p>The text of Greenspan's Oct. 28 speech was not made available. He reportedly spoke
  merely from notes. So newspapers could pick out whatever choice segment they felt was
  most important. But the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and most other newspapers
  did make it clear that he criticized the bankers. And the crux of the criticism was
  that they are responsible for the credit crunch.</p>

  <p>What does that mean?</p>

  <p>It means, according to Greenspan, that the banks are holding back granting "easier
  credit terms." The banks should be "more aggressive" in their lending practices, he
  said, so credit would be more easily available to businesses and consumers.</p>

  <p>Greenspan, a Reagan appointee, is considered a hardliner, a tightfisted banking
  official. It's astonishing that he would take such a posture. There must be a solid
  basis for it.</p>

  <p>In big business and high finance, accidental factors or slips of the tongue are
  easily rectified. But this was apparently well thought out in advance.</p>

  <p>So what's the cause of this truly extraordinary performance? It lies deep in the
  financial situation of the banks themselves. No, not the savings and loans &mdash; the
  biggest commercial banks, including such giants as Citicorp, Chemical and Manufacturers
  Hanover and dozens of others, the cream of the crop of U.S. finance capital.</p>

  <p>The new banking crisis should not be confused with the savings and loan crisis. The
  Bush administration happily solved that one by expending $500 billion and passing the
  bill on to the working class.</p>

  <p>This is played in the capitalist press as though the $500 billion has already been
  expended. But this bailout, this huge giveaway &mdash; really an unarmed robbery of the
  people &mdash; has not yet reached down to the population as a whole.</p>

  <h4>The bankers' bank</h4>

  <p>Over the weekend of Oct. 26-27 these capitalist newspapers covered the developing
  banking crisis: the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, the San
  Francisco Chronicle, the Los Angeles Times and others.</p>

  <p>Their objective isn't to lay the groundwork for an attack against the banks. It's to
  prepare public opinion to accept a bailout that no politician wants to even mention
  yet. They especially don't want to talk about it in light of the U.S. deficit's
  astronomical proportions.</p>

  <p>Greenspan criticized the banks for their lack of aggressiveness in making lending
  more available. But it must have fallen flat, if anyone took it seriously at all. Their
  response to any call for easier credit terms for business and consumers is that they
  are overloaded with nonperforming &mdash; that is, bad &mdash; loans as it is. They
  have to tighten up for sheer survival.</p>

  <p>If easier credit terms are to be made available, the bankers answer, the Federal
  Reserve should make them available to the bankers. The Federal Reserve, after all, is
  the central bank. It acts as a bankers' bank: member banks use their reserve accounts
  much as individuals use their checking accounts.</p>

  <p>In other words, all the banks deposit their reserve requirements in and borrow money
  from the Federal Reserve.</p>

  <p>For easier credit terms to be made available, the bankers say to Greenspan, it must
  start with the Federal Reserve. But the Federal Reserve has already reduced interest
  rates 10 times since the capitalist crisis is said to have started back some time in
  1990.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that when the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates for bankers,
  the banks aren't obligated to then reduce their own interest rates for ordinary
  consumers.</p>

  <p>If reducing interest rates is not a solution, then there remains only the ultimate
  one &mdash; a bailout by the federal government. But with a presidential election only
  a year away, no capitalist politician wants to even raise the question.</p>

  <h4>State intervention</h4>

  <p>So what Greenspan was doing in his speech, in a roundabout way, was to say what the
  bankers are saying: a bailout by the federal government is the proper remedy.</p>

  <p>He was publicly admitting how profound the economic crisis is. It has not by any
  means reached a stable recovery phase.</p>

  <p>Greenspan, along with most of his colleagues among bourgeois economists and
  academics, holds to the theory that every economic crisis contains the seeds of its own
  recovery. It is a comforting thought for capitalists &mdash; at least those who survive
  the crisis.</p>

  <p>But to those on the edge, the seeds of a real recovery must be planted by the
  capitalist state. And those on the edge include some of the biggest banks in the U.S.
  &mdash; like Citicorp, which used to be the most powerful in the world and now has
  given way to the Japanese banks.</p>

  <p>The capitalist state must intervene where ordinary, so-called spontaneous forces
  prove themselves incapable of correcting the crisis. The prosperity of the 1980s
  &mdash; for big business, multinational corporations and giants in all fields of
  capitalist endeavor &mdash; was obtained through a ruthless drive against the living
  standards of the workers. It was a most intense anti-labor offensive and it is still in
  progress. But it won't get the capitalist government's attention until a mass
  resurgence of the working class and the oppressed really takes hold and demands it.</p>

  <h4>GNP up?</h4>

  <p>The banking crisis is sure to lead not to an attack against the banks, but an
  attempt to unload the burden of the crisis on the backs of the working class and the
  oppressed masses.</p>

  <p>The government announced an increase in the Gross National Product on Oct. 29, the
  day after Greenspan's talk. It is a fair assumption that Greenspan knew about it since
  most of the GNP report's data were based on Federal Reserve statistical sources. For
  many years the Federal Reserve has indexed industrial production. Since that's the
  GNP's main component it can be assumed that Greenspan knew the character of the Oct. 29
  GNP report.</p>

  <p>All the more revealing, then, is his gloomy assessment of the capitalist
  economy.</p>

  <p>It's possible that the increase in the Gross National Product may only reflect a
  hurried attempt to liquidate overgrown inventories. If seen over a protracted period,
  the increase may turn out to be no more than a blip. A great many ruling class
  expectations are based on the assumption that the masses will let the bosses unload the
  bank crisis on their backs.</p>

  <p>But this is precisely the kind of assumption in which the ruling class has been
  historically mistaken. It did not anticipate the resurgence of the labor movement in
  this country following the great economic crisis that began with the stock market crash
  of October 1929. The entire Roosevelt package of reforms that came much later was, on
  the contrary, based on anticipating a labor movement upsurge and attempting to rein it
  in.</p>

  <h4>Stocks surge before fall</h4>

  <p>If the picture Greenspan painted was gloomy, as all the capitalist newspapers admit,
  then why did the stock market surge at news of it? The Dow Jones Industrials climbed
  40.70 points to 3045.62 on Oct. 28.</p>

  <p>The stock market is supposed to go up in response to economic growth, recovery. So
  why did it rise in the face of Greenspan's gloomy picture of the economy?</p>

  <p>Contradictory and inconsistent with the character of the report though this may
  seem, it is really quite in accord with the laws governing the capitalist economy.
  Capital always, even if only for a moment, flows to where the profit is highest.</p>

  <p>If industry and commerce are lagging, turning downward, the stock market offers the
  quickest, best investment. It offers an escape from industrial stagnation. At the same
  time stock market speculation can rise to dizzying heights.</p>

  <p>Shades of 1929! The stock market reaches its highest point precisely when industrial
  production is declining.</p>

  <p>At present the capitalist press itself is full of news of layoffs, cutbacks,
  bankruptcies and consolidations. It all adds up to an ever smaller workforce &mdash;
  the bourgeoisie's own terminology &mdash; creating more and more unemployed and driving
  the working class's purchasing power ever lower.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, every capitalist crisis sows the seeds of its own recovery? In reality
  this tautological formula explains nothing.</p>

  <p>Long before Marx came on the scene, classical bourgeois economists noted this
  phenomenon. As a world phenomenon, it came on the scene as early as 1825. Engels
  described it in his "Socialism, Utopian and Scientific":</p>

  <p>"Little by little the pace [of recovery] quickens. It becomes a trot. The industrial
  trot breaks into a canter, the canter in turns grows into a headlong gallop of a
  perfect steeplechase of industry, commercial credit and speculation, which finally
  after breakneck leaps ends where it began in the ditch of a crisis."</p>

  <p>In that paragraph Engels described the external features of the process of every
  capitalist crisis sowing the seeds of its own recovery. But Engels turned it right side
  up: Every recovery carries the seeds of its own destruction.</p>

  <p>However, this is merely the external aspect. Further on, Engels described something
  the capitalist economists would choose to ignore if they could: precisely the
  <strong>process</strong> of this transformation. For it is none other than the process
  of <strong>capitalist</strong> production.</p>

  <p>This was Marx's great contribution. He didn't only describe a well-known common
  external phenomenon. He demonstrated the inner springs of its development.</p>

  <p>Marx showed that at the root of this process lies the exploitation of the working
  class by the capitalist class. The source of capitalist profit lies in paying the
  workers a mere fraction of what they produce. The capitalist class garners and
  appropriates the lion's share. This maintains them as the ruling class.</p>

  <p>This endows them with the "right" to amass huge fortunes, to play politics and
  indeed play the role of financier, the patron saint of the arts, sciences or sports, to
  fund great charitable institutions and even play humanitarian. It's all on the basis of
  expropriating the unpaid labor of the working class.</p>

  <p>Greenspan's talk was avidly awaited by his audience for a signal as to where to put
  their money or how to borrow it. But he was careful to avoid the one big topic that
  could profoundly influence the capitalist economic cycle of development &mdash; how to
  move aggressively on the international arena.</p>

  <h4>Worldwide competition</h4>

  <p>At the time he was talking, the G7, the seven most powerful imperialist countries,
  were meeting or had just ended their deliberations, held in Bangkok. Why of all places
  there?</p>

  <p>One reason might have been to reduce media coverage. More likely, it was time to
  hold one of these secret conferences in Asia. But that could conceivably mean holding
  it in Japan at a time when Japan is doing better even though serious cracks in its
  economy are appearing.</p>

  <p>Holding the conference in Tokyo would again demonstrate the economic power of
  Japanese finance capital as against Wall Street.</p>

  <p>The current economic crisis has all the characteristic features of a prolonged,
  protracted crisis. It is growing more severe, notwithstanding some limited upward
  movement here and there. It shows an unmistakable kinship to the early 1930s, with the
  great capitalist crisis, which in reality was a breakdown of the capitalist system that
  extended over 10 years &mdash; 1929 to 1939.</p>

  <p>Of course, one cannot make an a priori conclusion about a repeat performance of the
  1929-1939 experience.</p>

  <p>The U.S. was only rescued from it, as were other capitalist countries, by diverting
  the economic crisis into an imperialist war. Under present circumstances such
  opportunities are not easily available.</p>

  <p>One thing that differentiates the current position of U.S. finance capital is that
  in the early 1930s the U.S. was the principal creditor nation in the world. That is
  absolutely incontestable. France, Italy, Germany, Great Britain &mdash; all were
  indebted to the U.S.</p>

  <p>The big problem for the European imperialist powers was how to pay their war debts
  to the U.S., incurred as a result of World War I. The pages of the capitalist financial
  press were filled with news of all sorts of maneuvers and negotiations to extend the
  payments or find ways and means to cancel them as a rescue operation for the European
  capitalists.</p>

  <p>Today the U.S.'s situation is vastly different.</p>

  <p>The U.S. is a debtor nation. Third World countries' debts loom large. They are an
  element in the U.S. banking crisis. But this has to be seen in the perspective of the
  hundreds of billions of dollars the U.S. has borrowed from foreign countries by selling
  U.S. certificates of indebtedness &mdash; bonds &mdash; abroad.</p>

  <h4>No way out</h4>

  <p>The huge sums of money that fueled the Pentagon war machine came in part from U.S.
  treasury sales paying high interest rates in capitalist countries and Third World
  countries throughout the 1980s. The Reagan-Bush years are predominantly years of
  unprecedented anti-labor offensive. This development, together with the huge
  indebtedness the U.S. has incurred abroad, created the ruling class's prosperity. The
  fortunes of the existing financial and industrial dynasties were enhanced and new ones
  spawned &mdash; all based on exploiting the working class abroad and at home.</p>

  <p>All the so-called restructuring invariably included not only vast layoffs but even
  vaster outsourcing in Third World countries, and most particularly by exploiting women
  workers. It is therefore a narrow and truncated view of the economic crisis to only
  take into account its domestic ramifications.</p>

  <p>Playing the role of creditor in the oppressed countries on the one hand, and on the
  other hand being a debtor worldwide, especially to the capitalist countries of Europe
  and Japan, puts U.S. finance capital in an ever more precarious situation.</p>

  <p>U.S. finance capital's post-war panacea of artificially stimulating the capitalist
  economy by conducting "local wars" like in Korea and Vietnam has run its course. The
  intervention in Iraq was the last straw in applying an artificial stimulant to a
  declining capitalist economy. It was supposed to be the big push that would accelerate
  the economy, a stimulant for economic growth.</p>

  <p>It turned out, as should be obvious now to all, to be a depressant. It's now clear
  that the intervention in Iraq slowed down rather than stepped up the capitalist
  economy. The Bush administration and the ruling class it represents hoped the collapse
  of the USSR and Eastern Europe would quickly offer great opportunity for the kind of
  economic and financial penetration that could rapidly bring about the super-profits
  that only a vast country like the USSR with its many, many resources could offer.</p>

  <p>But here again, rather than a window of opportunity as they would describe it, the
  evidence thus far presents the spectacle of a quagmire &mdash; not at all a California
  or Alaska type of gold rush.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to gain real insight into this specific phase of the capitalist
  crisis without considering the many international political problems. Most important,
  the U.S. acts as the principal oppressor at home while at the same time it is the
  principal oppressor abroad.</p>
