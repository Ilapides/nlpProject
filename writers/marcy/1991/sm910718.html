  <h1>Lessons of the BCCI collapse</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (July 18, 1991)</h5>

  <p>The working class movement is faced with an array of bewildering political and
  economic events which apparently are unrelated to the emerging capitalist crisis.</p>

  <p>The present crisis differs in some respects from all previous crises in this
  century. For one thing, it envelops parts of what were formerly regarded as socialist
  countries, most particularly in Eastern Europe but also in the USSR, where growing
  economic and political chaos grows out of a deliberate attempt to scuttle a socialized
  economy and restore capitalism.</p>

  <p>This crisis also differs from others in this century in that it really does cover
  almost every nook and corner of the planet. It has become a platitude to say that the
  world economy is now integrated. It has been so for many decades. What is new is that
  the means of communication have become so rapid that an abundance of information can
  now flow almost at a moment's notice from one part of the world to another.</p>

  <p>None of this, however, including the almost dizzying expansion of technology, has in
  any way negated the basic causes of the capitalist crisis. On the contrary, it has
  affirmed and aggravated them.</p>

  <h4>Dangerous symptom of crisis</h4>

  <p>At the moment, several huge entities of the capitalist economy are on the verge of
  collapse. Most prominent among them, of course, are the savings and loan banks of the
  United States, which have been in crisis for a considerable period, with no end in
  sight.</p>

  <p>More recent is the collapse of a mammoth worldwide bank, the Bank of Credit and
  Commerce International, announced in Britain on July 5. While the press in this country
  has generally played it in low key, with just a few articles in the New York Times, the
  Financial Times of London has given the collapse of the BCCI ongoing and massive
  coverage.</p>

  <p>Despite the subdued coverage in the U.S., it is a very important development and a
  dangerous symptom of capitalist crisis.</p>

  <p>The bank is reported to have assets of over $20 billion. This sum does not put it in
  the same league as giants like Citicorp, Chase Manhattan or any of the big British,
  French, German or Swiss banks. Its importance lies elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The BCCI has operated, according to the Financial Times, in 69 (one account says 73)
  countries, and was chartered in Luxembourg. It was so structured as to present the
  image of being a bank organized, run and owned by Third World countries, most
  particularly Abu Dhabi and Pakistan. It was specially regarded for its Third World
  operations and leadership.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of many Third World people, that would give it much more credibility
  than the outright imperialist banks, which of course are also operating in many parts
  of the Third World and may become the target of the masses when widespread suffering
  turns to militancy.</p>

  <p>BCCI's principal stockholders are Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, the ruler of
  Abu Dhabi, and other Abu Dhabi officials. Together they own 77% of the stock.
  Nevertheless, the bank's operations were shut down not by leading Third World countries
  but by the imperialist banking regulators of England, the U.S., France, Switzerland,
  Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of many in the Third World, these events may appear to be a political
  plot by the imperialists to shut down a thriving, worldwide financial institution.
  However that may be, it is still the inevitable result of a crisis in the world banking
  system. But, as in the case of the savings and loan institutions in the U.S., the
  crisis is presented as resulting from fraud, deception and corruption.</p>

  <h4>Banks and drug money</h4>

  <p>On July 6, the Financial Times reported that the BCCI had been convicted last year
  in the U.S. for laundering money, which these days is understood to be linked to drug
  trafficking. However, this seemed to have made no dent in its capacity to continue its
  operations.</p>

  <p>We should state <em>inter alia</em> that it is often said that illegal drug
  trafficking upsets the capitalist market and is one of the causes of economic crises.
  That's altogether false.</p>

  <p>Illegal sales of commodities do not influence the nature of the capitalist crisis.
  Cocaine or any other illegal drug is merely another commodity. The many illegal
  transactions on the so-called shadow or black market which exists side-by-side with the
  legal market have no significant effect on the inner workings of the capitalist system,
  although they may be a symptom of crisis.</p>

  <p>Early in 1986, it was reported that Bank of America, First Boston Corporation, Chase
  Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Chemical, Crocker National and Irving Trust
  Company all had been fined by the government for violations of the rules requiring
  reporting of large cash deposits. (New York Times, Jan. 22, 1986. Also see Sam Marcy's
  book, <em>High Tech, Low Pay,</em> for a discussion of drug money laundering and the
  banks.)</p>

  <h4>A supranational bank</h4>

  <p>The very existence of this bank, operating in so many Third World countries, even
  including the Shenzhen ``special economic zone'' in China, demonstrates a relatively
  new tendency in international finance capital which may be called the supranational
  bank.</p>

  <p>The traditional imperialist banks, as we know, are situated in Wall Street, Lombard
  Street of London, the Bourse of Paris, the Kabutocho of Tokyo, and their equivalents in
  Germany and Switzerland. The point about the supranational bank tendency is that its
  orientation is to be free, to a limited degree, of state and governmental supervision.
  It tries to put itself beyond the reach of the governments where it operates and to
  incur the least amount of obligations to depositors and lenders.</p>

  <p>For instance, in the United States, deposits in banks which carry the insurance of
  the FDIC are guaranteed up to $100,000. (Of course, big depositors who have millions
  may make deposits in a multitude of banks, thereby qualifying for the insurance which
  was intended to cover small depositors.) For the most part, deposits in banks in the
  Third World, particularly in the poorest countries, are not protected.</p>

  <p>As for its broader significance, such a bank becomes a medium for draining the
  financial assets of the less developed countries. This in part explains how imperialist
  finance capital retards industrial and economic development in the less developed
  countries. The wealth is ultimately poured into the coffers of the big imperialist
  banks, without which the BCCI could not exist. It is a means to plunder any depositors,
  even those with small accounts, but largely the national bourgeois elements who have
  the wherewithal to make deposits.</p>

  <p>The tipoff as to who actually has the decisive say in this big bank is that the Bank
  of England took the initiative in closing down the BCCI. The governor of Britain's
  central bank, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, seized control of most of the bank's global
  operations. He acted in concert with regulators in the U.S., France, Switzerland,
  Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. The latter is really the creation of the big
  imperialists. The operation was closed down without even informing the principal
  stockholders in Abu Dhabi.</p>

  <p>It was only after the order to close the bank was issued that the banking
  authorities of Abu Dhabi protested. But to no avail.</p>

  <h4>Charges of corruption and deceit</h4>

  <p>Often just before a general collapse, a welter of rumors appears attributing the
  causes of the collapse of this or that bank or corporation to fraud and deceit. The
  same is true in the collapse of this mammoth international bank.</p>

  <p>Reports call it the worst banking scandal ever. The failure of the S&amp;Ls was also
  said to be a scandal involving some of the principal banking officials, and some of the
  officers have been indicted and convicted. It is so much like what has happened in
  previous capitalist crises, when the symptoms were confused with the fundamental
  causes.</p>

  <p>The symptoms as reported in the capitalist press almost always are criminal conduct
  by the corporate officers as well as the government officials entrusted with overseeing
  their functions, such as the banking regulatory agencies.</p>

  <p>This has been the case in almost every crisis, and most particularly since the
  collapse that began with the 1929 stock market crash. When the Bank of the United
  States, chartered in New York, collapsed, the cause was attributed to the officials of
  the bank, who were charged, tried and convicted.</p>

  <p>It happened again more recently when in the late seventies and early eighties such
  pillars of capitalist finance as the Franklin National Bank (now renamed European
  American), Penn Square Bank, Drysdale Securities and Continental Illinois Bank all
  capsized.</p>

  <p>The objective significance of the charges of fraud, deceit, mismanagement,
  inefficiency, corruption, etc., etc., is to divert attention from the fundamental
  causes of the crisis. The claims of moral turpitude blur any attempt to get at what is
  at the bottom of it all.</p>

  <p>To say that is the fundamental cause of the capitalist crisis is to substitute moral
  criteria for economic analysis.</p>

  <h4>Bourgeois remedies</h4>

  <p>Bourgeois politicians and economists often seek a cure for the malady of the
  economic system in sterner punishment, greater government supervision, greater
  awareness by high government officials.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, another wing of the ruling class attributes the crisis to
  intervention by the government, saying that business has been hamstrung and rendered
  unable to solve its own problems precisely because of government interference.</p>

  <p>None of this goes to the root of the problem.</p>

  <p>Some bourgeois economists do go further than merely dealing with the superficial
  aspects of the crisis and attempt a serious analysis of the causes. They borrow some
  from Marxism and say that capitalism is capable of producing an abundance of goods and
  services but the working class is unable to buy it all back because the lion's share of
  its labor is appropriated by the bosses and constitutes their profit.</p>

  <p>Underconsumption is the fundamental cause of the crisis, in their view. They are for
  state intervention to increase the purchasing power of the masses &mdash; through
  unemployment insurance, government-funded job creation, etc.</p>

  <p>It is of course all too true that there is a super-abundance of consumer goods, and
  that the workers are unable to buy them all precisely because of the extortionate
  profit the bosses make from the unpaid labor of the workers. But these economists think
  that it's merely a question of adjusting the imbalance between production and
  consumption. Then everything will move smoothly once again.</p>

  <p>This is a fallacy. If a mere adjustment of production to consumption would fix
  things, then surely there are enough economists, technicians and engineers of all kinds
  to make that necessary adjustment and wipe out the imbalance. After all, if they can
  adjust the functioning of a satellite after propelling it into space, they surely ought
  to be able to find a formula to fine-tune the system. But in the end, the solution of
  these most advanced bourgeois economists proves to be a total failure.</p>

  <p>Underconsumption has characterized all previous societies based upon scarcity and
  the insufficient growth of the productive forces. The peasants had to give the
  landlords the cream of the crop. Slave society coincided with poverty of the masses.
  But in capitalist society, there is poverty amidst super-abundance.</p>

  <h4>The magic of the market</h4>

  <p>It would be easy enough to adjust the balance between production and consumption
  were production destined solely for the purpose of meeting the demands of the
  consumers. But that is not the case. Our bourgeois economists know, or should know,
  that this meets with an insurmountable obstacle. The capitalists do not produce goods
  in such abundance for purposes of consumption, to respond to human needs. That is not
  the objective orientation of capitalist production.</p>

  <p>Capitalist production is oriented solely and exclusively to the capitalist market,
  where it must turn a profit, and not for purposes of consumption as such.</p>

  <p>It is true that ultimately whatever is produced must meet the needs of the consumer.
  But it must first pass the test of the capitalist market. This barrier cannot be
  breached by moral suasion, governmental edicts or even religious incantations.</p>

  <p>If capitalist production does not pass the test of profitability, then vast
  quantities of commodities will remain in storage or, as happened frequently in the
  past, will be deliberately destroyed or dumped in the ocean. The capitalists will not
  produce just for the sake of meeting the consumers' needs, no matter how dire they may
  be.</p>

  <p>The market is not just a place where seller meets buyer. Bourgeois economists point
  out that there's no longer any need to have a physical or geographical place for the
  market. The market operates by telephone or even telecommunications, as witness the
  world stock and commodities markets.</p>

  <p>The absolutely indispensable characteristic in the purchase and sale of commodities
  or real estate is the private ownership of the means of production. It is a transaction
  based primarily and fundamentally on private property.</p>

  <p>Were this not so, then the imbalance between production and consumption would reduce
  itself to a matter of efficiency in distribution and nothing more. Of course, there may
  be periods of scarcity, such as those caused by natural disasters, but they don't cause
  capitalist crisis. They are readily overcome by rebuilding technology or increasing
  efficiency.</p>

  <p>Since the great crisis when the capitalist system actually broke down for a period
  of time after 1929, there have been a number of cyclical crises followed by upturns.
  These ups and downs have been <strong>interruptions</strong> in the emergence of a
  second breakdown of the capitalist system.</p>

  <p>Most capitalist economists, when they write about the great depression, don't say
  how long it lasted. One exception is Charles P. Kindleberger, in his book <em>The World
  Depression: 1929 to 1939</em> (University of California Press, 1973). This
  well-documented bourgeois account of the decade-long crisis demonstrates that it was a
  breakdown of the capitalist system. That's why it was so prolonged and was only
  overcome by the Second World War. Now we're facing a similar situation, where the U.S.
  ruling class is again trying to divert the economic crisis by such imperialist
  adventures as the war against Iraq. But this time militarism has not got them out of
  the crisis.</p>

  <p>Militarism as an artificial stimulant is not an eternal category. It has been seen
  over the past decade that eventually it turns into a depressant. The tendency toward a
  general breakdown of capitalism, while it may have been interrupted, has not been
  reversed. On the contrary, the diversion of resources into militarism can make the
  crisis more severe.</p>

  <p>All these efforts to hold back the crisis don't solve the overall contradiction that
  lies at the bottom of it all. On the one hand, production in the modern era is
  socialized; even the tiniest microchip has embodied in it the labor of millions of
  workers. Capitalist production has become thoroughly collectivized. On the other hand,
  however, this collective labor is appropriated by a small group of super-wealthy
  imperialists who maintain a monopoly of ownership over the means of production.</p>
