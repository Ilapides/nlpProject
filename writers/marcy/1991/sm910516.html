  <h1>The new crisis in the USSR</h1>

  <h2>Ceding control of the coal mines and the Gorbachev-Yeltsin coalition</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (May 16, 1991)</h5>

  <p>A new crisis has come to the fore in the Soviet Union with the announcement by
  Russian radio on May 6 that the Soviet government had ceded jurisdiction over the coal
  mines in Russia to the Russian republic, headed at the present time by Boris
  Yeltsin.</p>

  <p>More than half the coal mines in the Soviet Union will be affected, including those
  in the Kuznetsk Basin in central Siberia, the Sakhalin Basin in the Far East, and the
  Rostov mines near the Ukraine.</p>

  <p>Such a development seriously infringes on the nature of the Soviet Union as a
  planned economy based on public ownership of the means of production in the hands of
  the state.</p>

  <h4>Secret meeting on April 23</h4>

  <p>The transfer of the coal mines was agreed to on April 23 at a secret meeting between
  Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and the heads of nine republics, including Yeltsin.
  While Pravda broke the news of the meeting on April 24, the specific agreement on the
  transfer of the mines was not made public at that time. The New York Times of April 25
  wrote of the meeting:</p>

  <p>"President Mikhail S. Gorbachev yielded significantly to the Soviet republics'
  demands for power sharing today as he promised revisions of his highly unpopular price
  and tax programs and announced a new agreement with the major republics for a `radical
  enhancement' of their role in governing.</p>

  <p>"The surprise pact was worked out with leaders of 9 of the nation's 15 republics,
  including Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian federated republic and chief
  opposition critic of Mr. Gorbachev, at a private meeting held secretly at a dacha on
  Tuesday."</p>

  <p>The leaders thereafter issued an accord, excerpts of which were published in the
  capitalist press. The republics represented were the Russian federation, the Ukraine,
  Byelorussia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Tadjikistan, Kirghizia and Turkmenia.
  Apparently excluded from the meeting were the Baltic republics, Georgia, Moldavia and
  Armenia.</p>

  <p>What prompted this meeting, which amounts to a coalition of the Gorbachev forces and
  those of Yeltsin? Without doubt it is the deepening of the economic crisis. For the
  first time since the Second World War, production is actually "plummeting," says the
  accord.</p>

  <p>The problems are so acute that "living standards are declining, posing a threat" to
  the ability of the government to "provide the basic necessities of life." The crisis is
  posed in the starkest form possible.</p>

  <p>One of the purposes of the meeting was to warn the growing number of strikers in the
  Soviet Union of the economic danger that the country faces and to appeal to them to
  terminate the strikes.</p>

  <p>This supremely important meeting was held in secret despite the fact that glasnost
  has been in effect for more than five years. The period has been widely advertised as
  one of openness, where political discussion is free and easy and the government has
  assumed the obligation of letting the people know what is happening in its various
  branches. For example, the 19th Party Conference of June 1988 was televised in full for
  the general public. It was also carried by CNN in the United States and elsewhere. The
  Congress of Deputies which met in May 1989 also was fully televised from beginning to
  end.</p>

  <p>So much for glasnost.</p>

  <p>However, this meeting, whose deliberations resulted in the formation of a virtual
  coalition government of the two opposing factions, was held in secret. It came as a
  shock to the public, the media and even to the partisans of each of the factions.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Yeltsin, the most vociferous in demanding more and more glasnost (for
  the bourgeois elements, of course), called a special secret session of the Russian
  Parliament on the next day, April 24. No reason was given for its hush-hush
  character.</p>

  <h4>A vote of thanks from U.S. imperialism</h4>

  <p>If the New York Times editorial of April 26 is any indication, the accord makes
  happy reading for the imperialist bourgeoisie. The agreement, according to the Times,
  is "the first hopeful sign in months that radical reform can be revived and hard-line
  dictatorship avoided. America has an enormous stake in extending support for this
  promising development." The editorial concluded, "Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin are due
  a vote of thanks, and not just from the Soviet people."</p>

  <p>The secret meeting has now been followed by news of the shift in jurisdiction over
  the mines to the Russian Republic. The surrender of the public ownership of the mines
  by the national government to the Russian Republic could constitute the most
  devastating blow to the socialized economy of the USSR and could possibly set the
  country completely on the road towards counterrevolution.</p>

  <p>The happiness of the bourgeoisie at this development is quite understandable.
  However, there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip, as the historical evolution of
  the USSR has shown.</p>

  <p>In the first place, it is not clear what all this may mean in practice. If it means
  merely the right to manage the coal industry and to have title to the mines, this would
  not be the same thing as the Russian republic being able to sell the mines and
  privatize them.</p>

  <p>Also, what benefits would the individual coal mines obtain? It is said they will
  have the right to export and sell coal on their own without the express permission of
  the Soviet government. We have raised this possibility in earlier articles and shown
  that even the central government, with its tremendous administrative machinery
  developed over 70 years, finds it difficult to sell coal on the world market in light
  of the present glut.</p>

  <p>Individual enterprises, or even the republic, would face tremendous obstacles
  selling coal on the world market. The competition with France, Germany, Britain, Italy
  and even Poland would be fierce. If the Yeltsin argument is correct &mdash; that the
  mines are in dilapidated condition and need to be modernized in order to lower the cost
  of production &mdash; where would they get the capital except from the central
  government?</p>

  <h4>Champion of economic independence?</h4>

  <p>Here it is necessary to categorically state that Yeltsin's positioning of himself as
  the champion of economic sovereignty and independence for the republics is just pure
  hocum. It is the most absurd demagogy and deceitful propaganda, more fitting for a
  neofascist leader than a so-called liberalizer and super-democrat.</p>

  <p>We live in an interdependent world economy. The pages of the world press are full of
  it. The Soviet Union today, notwithstanding the dislocations, sabotage and economic
  crisis, is an integrated economy, the result of 70 years of development in science,
  technology and industry. Soviet planning aims at self-sufficiency so as to absorb the
  products of each of the republics and minimize reliance on exports. How could any of
  the republics become economically "independent" when no republic anywhere in the world
  is economically independent today? Not Japan, France, Britain, not even the U.S.</p>

  <p>It can mean only one thing: an invitation to the imperialists to come in and
  purchase the republic virtually for a song, making it a neocolony of the imperialist
  powers. Yeltsin knows this and so do most of his cohorts, especially those from
  bourgeois academia.</p>

  <p>Although the agreement reached on April 23 does not necessarily indicate a coalition
  government has been formed, this nevertheless deserves closer scrutiny. Yeltsin's
  stature as head of the biggest republic in the country makes a certain amount of
  collaboration unavoidable. However, a formal coalition between the supporters of
  Gorbachev, who hold a centrist position on the bourgeois reforms, and the Yeltsin
  supporters, who really stand for capitalist restoration, can only be of a temporary
  character and is most dangerous to the cause of socialism.</p>

  <p>But first of all, what is the nature of this coalition? We know of many coalition
  governments in the capitalist world.</p>

  <h4>Different coalition governments</h4>

  <p>For instance, in Britain there have been any number of coalition governments between
  the Conservatives and the Liberals. Also, the Labour Party in the 1930s joined a
  coalition with the Conservatives. There was the Weimar Republic in Germany. Italy has
  had 35 coalition governments since the Second World War. In the U.S., right-wing
  Republicans joined the Roosevelt administration during the war. Henry Stimson was
  Secretary of State and Harry Woodring was Secretary of War.</p>

  <p>There was a unique form of coalition government in the early thirties in both France
  and Spain when the Communist parties joined bourgeois radical parties to form a
  coalition government called the Popular Front. This was under the impetus of a
  resurgence of the popular masses &mdash; the workers and, in Spain, the peasants.</p>

  <p>But all these coalitions were forms of parliamentary rule that did not go beyond the
  confines of bourgeois property relations. They did not challenge the basis of
  capitalist exploitation and oppression. However radical or even revolutionary they may
  have been in terms of social programs, they did not challenge the class foundations of
  the system.</p>

  <p>The Popular Fronts are often called Communist-front governments. This confusion
  arises from the fact that in France and to a lesser degree in Spain the masses of
  workers eventually intervened and began to take over and occupy the plants. This forced
  the bourgeoisie to break up the coalition and open an assault upon the workers.</p>

  <p>What kind of a coalition do we have in the USSR, assuming it holds?</p>

  <h4>Workers' state in USSR</h4>

  <p>The coalition exists within the framework of a workers' state, although not a
  full-fledged, thriving workers' state moving in the direction of socialism. The state
  has existed for over 70 years and, notwithstanding periods when it moved backward and
  forward, it has survived endless hardships, civil war, counterrevolutionary
  insurrections and a full-scale imperialist war.</p>

  <p>Although badly damaged, it is still a workers' state. Boris Yeltsin says in his book
  <em>Against the Grain</em> (New York, London: Summit Books, 1990), "If one puts the
  theory and the practice of socialism side by side and compares them with an
  unprejudiced eye, it becomes clear that of all its classic elements, the only one to
  have been put into effect is the socialization of property, and even that has been done
  very crudely."</p>

  <p>Indeed, it is precisely the socialization of property, the state ownership of the
  basic means of production, which is the foundation of a workers' state. All the other
  so-called classic elements, whatever he may mean by that, may make the system more
  progressive, but they can be demolished if the bourgeoisie owns the means of
  production. A capitalist crisis wreaks havoc on the social gains of the workers,
  especially when there's the threat of a fascist dictatorship.</p>

  <p>At the present moment, the basic means of production are still in the hands of the
  workers' state, which has been under relentless siege ever since the 1985 plenum of the
  CPSU when Gorbachev was elected General Secretary. However, the workers' state has been
  yielding ground to hostile, anti-socialist forces.</p>

  <h4>Worst political and economic crisis</h4>

  <p>As of today, it faces its severest political and economic crisis. The question
  really is whether the USSR can long remain a workers' state, even in skeletal form, or
  whether the bourgeois reforms will eat away at its vitals, dismantle the progressive
  complex of social and political institutions, and privatize the means of production.
  The precondition for this is of course the abolition of the planned economy, which has
  been damaged by successive inroads including the surrender of the monopoly of foreign
  trade.</p>

  <p>To better understand the divergent political positions of the Gorbachev and Yeltsin
  factions, it is best to bear in mind that both of these leaders were together in the
  same Politburo just a few years ago. Most of the leading personnel in the present
  administration are high officials of the Communist Party. Only a few, notably some of
  the free-market economists, come from the fringes or outside of the party
  leadership.</p>

  <p>The very idea of restructuring the economic system of the USSR was first taken up at
  a plenum of the Central Committee and later at a party conference. The restructuring
  plans &mdash; perestroika &mdash; were unanimously approved by the party. There were no
  dissenters.</p>

  <p>In his book, Yeltsin says that he and Yegor Ligachev, once regarded by the
  imperialists as leader of the "hard-liners," hold the "same strategic position" on
  perestroika; that their differences are only tactical. However, it is precisely these
  tactical differences that make a world of difference.</p>

  <p>As we pointed out earlier (in <em>Perestroika: A Marxist Critique,</em> New York, WW
  Publishers, 1990), Gorbachev originally conceived of perestroika as a plan to modernize
  agriculture, industry, finance and the like. He particularly stressed the
  rationalization of industry. The Gorbachev grouping promised to take advantage of the
  new scientific-technological revolution to the fullest extent. He and his associates
  stressed that the USSR was lagging behind the Western capitalist countries and even
  some of the developing countries and that it was necessary to go through a complete
  transformation on that score.</p>

  <p>Few dissented. Indeed, it was greeted with enthusiasm everywhere. Of course, the
  technological changeover would bring about a certain amount of disruption and temporary
  unemployment, but this was considered normal. The state would absorb the hardship. It
  was not going to be like the unemployment endemic to the capitalist system.</p>

  <h4>Evolution of perestroika</h4>

  <p>However, the scientific-technological revolution was rather slow in starting. Soon
  it was being said that other changes of a social character had to come first. It had
  all the earmarks of a retreat from the improvement in the material conditions of the
  workers, peasants and general population that had been promised.</p>

  <p>Then-Prime Minister of the USSR, Nikolai Ryzhkov, himself began to lead a charge
  against so-called levelers among the workers. This was soon taken up by the press and
  media with a virulence that would shock an ordinary worker.</p>

  <p>Where did this attack on leveling come from? The term goes back to the period of the
  revolutionary government under Lenin, when social equality was still at the top of the
  agenda. The crude idea of "leveling" wages was dismissed as infantile. But that's not
  the issue today.</p>

  <p>The issue for many years now has been the privileged status of the officialdom of
  the party and particularly those in the industrial establishments. For the government
  to open an attack now on levelers lacks credibility and could only evoke a feeling of
  cynicism among the masses towards the new restructuring plans.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the attack against the supposed levelers came together with a campaign
  to introduce material incentives, as though this were a new idea. But older workers
  remember the Stakhanovite movement of the thirties, which reintroduced piece work,
  among other things. While some of the ideas of the Stakhanovite movement raised
  productivity, it also did considerable damage to the solidarity of the working
  class.</p>

  <p>Those who are constantly intoning against the passivity of the Soviet workers today,
  and are particularly aghast at the miners now ensnared into the Yeltsin reactionary
  camp, ought to remember that the promised enhancement of material incentives mostly
  helped the upper crust of workers and even more the managerial staffs of the
  enterprises.</p>

  <h4>Managers embrace restructuring</h4>

  <p>The next phase in the development of restructuring seemed to be directed at winning
  the allegiance of the managers of industrial enterprises. Indeed, the not-so-covert
  attack against the workers was followed by a veritable campaign to win over the
  managerial staff to a new program. The managers would now have wide discretion and be
  freed, at least to a limited extent, from the "command economy," from the dead hand of
  the bureaucracy.</p>

  <p>No longer would they have to follow the rigid quotas set in Moscow, but could use
  their own heads on how much to produce. More significantly, the emphasis would be on
  quality rather than quantity. But this relief from the extreme rigidity in quotas or
  the lack of emphasis on quality was greatly exaggerated.</p>

  <p>So while a general political program to democratize the economic organs of the state
  was a welcome development, all this had very significant side effects. It introduced a
  monstrous form of competition that is the very opposite of what earlier socialist
  emulation campaigns were supposed to be, that is, competition within the framework of
  cooperation for the development of socialism.</p>

  <p>Now you had a vicious competition of one against all and all against one, resulting
  in the hoarding of goods and materials. The new freedom was utilized for self-seeking
  purposes by managers to raise profitability. Of course, the workers were promised huge
  gains as well.</p>

  <p>All this had been introduced as a new phase of the scientific-technological
  revolution to modernize the entire Soviet industrial and transport system and make
  consumer goods widely accessible. But nothing like this was developing.</p>

  <p>Then new formulations began appearing in the press and in the pronouncements of the
  government, beginning with Gorbachev himself. The restructuring was explained as first
  and foremost a social revolution rather than a technological one. The social aspect of
  perestroika would precede and not follow the scientific-technological revolution.</p>

  <h4>A change in property relations</h4>

  <p>But concretely, this vague formulation on a revolution in social relations was
  taking on the form of a change in property relations. That was an altogether different
  conception from what was originally enunciated in 1985 and 1986. It appeared now that
  perestroika could not proceed unless market relations were broadened to encompass the
  whole economy. This sharp turnaround gave new heart and courage to the outright
  bourgeois restorationist elements, who began their own campaign for privatization, for
  a change in the law regarding property.</p>

  <p>Step by step the Gorbachev restructuring was feeding reaction up to the point of
  actually feeding capitalist restoration. Each one of his innovations emboldened the
  bourgeois elements. Finally, after the meeting of the Congress of Soviets, the most
  extreme faction calling itself the Inter-Regional Group of Deputies (IRGD) met by
  themselves as a separate body. Andrei Sakharov and Boris Yeltsin were its leaders. By
  this time, Yeltsin himself had undergone an evolution far to the right of
  Gorbachev.</p>

  <p>Says Yeltsin, "I believe that July 29-30, 1989, will go down in the history of
  Soviet society. It was then ... that the IRGD first met. The epoch of monolithic unity
  was brought to an end."</p>

  <p>There were many points of difference in this relatively small grouping. However, on
  one question there was unanimity. "No doubt the main one is the question of property.
  If one accepts the private ownership of property, then this means the collapse of the
  main buttress that supports the state's monopoly of property ownership and everything
  that stems from it. ... The second point in our program is probably less important, the
  land question. The slogan `Land to the peasants' is even more relevant than it was
  70-odd years ago. Only when land is worked by the people who own it will the country be
  fed."</p>

  <p>This means the dismantling of the collective and state farms and the return to
  private property.</p>

  <h4>Demagogy on the national question</h4>

  <p>"Next is the decentralization of power, the economic independence of the republics
  and their genuine sovereignty. This will go far toward solving the country's ethnic
  problems." Yeltsin's unbridled demagogy, based on fraud and deceit regarding
  sovereignty for the republics, is what has aggravated and intensified the strife since
  he began his anti-socialist campaign against the central government.</p>

  <p>Most demagogic of all is his call for "the elimination of all structural and
  financial limitations to the economic independence of enterprises and labor
  collectives." Even the imperialist press dare not go that far.</p>

  <p>None of the republics, including the Russian republic, can stand on its own feet
  "independently" and "with genuine sovereignty." Whatever else it may be, the USSR is a
  unitary state; 70 years of life and labor have coordinated an economic system which is
  interdependent.</p>

  <p>Its greatest problem has been the isolation imposed upon the Soviet Union by 40
  years of military encirclement and economic blockade.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev regime, instead of fearing the spectacle of the republics declaring
  their independence, especially secession from the likes of the Baltic republics or
  Georgia, should call their bluff and say, Go on, secede if you want to, for you
  couldn't stand on your own legs very long without the assistance and economic
  relationship with the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>The truth is they are dependent on the Soviet Union for raw materials and a market
  for their products. Gorbachev should hand them the New York Times of May 6, where they
  can read the following:</p>

  <p>"For years, the nations of the Eastern bloc grumbled that Moscow's arcane system for
  trade with its allies was little more than a swindle. Just give us a chance to sell our
  goods for cold hard dollars, they insisted, and we will show you who comes out ahead.
  On Jan. 1 they got their wish, and they have rued the day ever since." The headline of
  the article was, "Eastern Europe's Hardships Grow As Trade With Soviets Dries Up."</p>

  <p>The same goes for Georgia. How interesting it is that the earthquake which destroyed
  so much property and took so many lives last week has attracted so little attention in
  the West, particularly the United States. Washington has enough on its hands with the
  Kurdish refugees and the great human disaster in Bangladesh. The U.S. ruling class is
  more politically concerned right now with having a significant foothold in the
  subcontinent, in order to hold vast India at bay and give itself more maneuverability
  vis-a-vis Pakistan.</p>

  <p>Remember all the concern with the earthquake in Armenia a few years ago? That seemed
  to have more political significance for imperialism than the disaster in Georgia.</p>

  <p>In none of these cases is humanitarianism a factor when arrayed against predatory
  political interest.</p>

  <h4>Main difference between Gorbachev and Yeltsin</h4>

  <p>What does the current political impasse signify in terms of the party, Gorbachev's
  grouping as a whole, and the outright restorationists?</p>

  <p>Judging on the basis of his many reports and press interviews, Gorbachev and his
  grouping would like the restructuring to proceed until there is a full-scale free
  market &mdash; free in the sense of capitalist, although it is not spelled out that way
  at all. The Yeltsin restorationist group, however, is for the abolition of the public
  ownership of the means of production. Gorbachev himself is opposed to liquidating the
  public ownership of the means of production. As he has said, there are two things he
  will not give in on: the dismemberment of the USSR and the public ownership of the
  means of production.</p>

  <p>Presumably that accounted for his disassociation with the 500-day plan under which
  the restorationists intended to dismantle the USSR as a workers' state and privatize
  the means of production.</p>

  <p>How stable and viable a coalition can there be if the differences are really so
  fundamental? Can it endure?</p>

  <p>With respect to the free market, there's a wide difference of opinion as to what it
  all means, where it should apply and where it should not. Does it mean the purchase and
  sale of small and medium sized industry? Does it apply only to consumer goods? To
  retail establishments? To the myriad forms of sale of everyday commodities and the
  shadow economy in the service sector? The market was opened up years ago, but where
  will it stop?</p>

  <p>It is one thing if, after the socialist revolution when the workers' state has
  overthrown the former owners and taken hold of the means of production, but has had no
  time to put the new social order into practice, it allows the existence of a free
  market. For a while the capitalist free market may coexist along with the new
  revolutionary overturn of property relations. All this is clear as daylight. The
  revolution has had no time to exercise the rule of the working class in all phases of
  the economy.</p>

  <p>It's an altogether different matter to reverse decades-old forms of socialist
  distribution &mdash; even if they are as yet only embryonic because of compromises with
  the existence of the petty bourgeoisie and because the workers' state is unable to
  successfully eliminate the free capitalist market while at the same time preventing the
  growth of the so-called shadow market.</p>

  <h4>Effects of price changes</h4>

  <p>What program does the Gorbachev grouping propose to really stabilize the economy?
  The elimination of the sales tax will possibly mollify some sections of the population,
  but at the same time it will not lighten the burden of the increasing budgetary
  deficit.</p>

  <p>The so-called revolution in prices proposed originally by economists Zaslavskaya,
  Aganbegyan, Popov and others was supposed to bring prices into line with costs. But the
  steep increase announced several weeks ago was grist to the mill for the demagogues
  among the restorationists. It was virtually a gift to them.</p>

  <p>It is incomprehensible how this presumably adroit and cunning politician, Gorbachev,
  could have committed himself to do this under such circumstances. It gave the
  restorationist elements the opportunity to make hay for themselves. Its political
  effect was to antagonize the masses.</p>

  <p>The idea of price restructuring was a means of expropriating the workers' income in
  the first place. If it was meant as a form of obtaining a capital fund for
  modernization purposes, it was a poor way to do it. Under no conceivable circumstances
  could it possibly serve as a means for buttressing a modernization program to reequip
  the mines, mills and factories of the USSR. It was merely a redistribution of the
  income to mollify the upper crust of the bourgeois elements.</p>

  <p>At any rate, it was never demonstrated empirically how the price increases either
  improved the well-being of the masses or raised the efficiency of the economic system.
  The chaos, hoarding and shortages which became more apparent following the institution
  of the price changes are the most eloquent testimony to their failure.</p>

  <p>This coalition is most fragile and precarious. It is not based on actual
  collaboration between the two antagonistic groupings other than to persuade the miners
  and other workers to go back to work. The miners' strike has been turned into a
  political strike. One of its principal demands is for Gorbachev to resign, precisely
  what the Yeltsin forces have been pushing.</p>

  <p>The price increases and especially the sales tax helped the restorationist forces to
  gain strength. This explains Gorbachev's move in the direction of finding an avenue to
  collaborate with Yeltsin. By taking him into the government, Gorbachev again raised the
  stature of Yeltsin personally as well as that of his reactionary constituency.</p>

  <p>The current phase of the struggle in the USSR is part of a lengthier transition. The
  axis of the struggle is whether to advance from the public ownership of the means of
  production and the complex of progressive social and political institutions to a higher
  stage of socialism &mdash; or surrender to privatization, which in turn will restore
  the exploitative capitalist system.</p>
