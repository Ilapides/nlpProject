  <h1>Turning point in the war</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Feb. 28, 1991)</h5>

  <p>February 20 &mdash; To understand the current phase of the imperialist war against
  Iraq, it is necessary to see it in the perspective of the recent historical period
  involving the Middle East as a whole.</p>

  <p>The first phase of the struggle began with Iraq's Aug. 2 intervention into Kuwait,
  which it proclaimed part of the Iraqi nation. From Aug. 2 until Aug. 8, the U.S.
  mobilized the leading imperialist countries &mdash; Britain, France, Japan, Germany,
  Spain, Italy and Canada &mdash; and a number of minor dependent states. During this
  period the U.S. and its imperialist allies utilized the UN Security Council as a screen
  for their preparations for a predatory war against an oppressed nation. Kuwait was the
  pretext.</p>

  <p>For the next three-and-a-half months, the U.S. was engaged in dragooning as many
  governments as possible &mdash; by coercion, bribery or corruption &mdash; to support
  its designs on the sovereignty of the entire Middle East region. During this period,
  both China and the Soviet Union definitively defected from their previous
  anti-imperialist positions. Earlier, they had been relatively helpful in supporting the
  struggles of oppressed countries against imperialism.</p>

  <p>During this entire period the USSR seemed to work hand in glove with the U.S. The
  aim was to force the Iraqi government to capitulate to the demands of the Security
  Council resolutions and unconditionally withdraw from Kuwait. This was the period when
  the UN imposed a whole series of economic sanctions against Iraq.</p>

  <h4>The Nov. 29 resolution</h4>

  <p>The series of anti-Iraq resolutions emanating from the Security Council reached a
  climax on Nov. 29 when that body passed a resolution &mdash; sponsored by the U.S. and
  co-sponsored by the Soviet Union &mdash; that gave the U.S. the green light to
  militarily attack Iraq. China abstained on this last resolution, but had voted for the
  previous ones. China effectively removed itself from the UN deliberations and the
  maneuvers directed against Iraq, but also made a deep retreat from any semblance of
  anti-imperialist solidarity with Iraq.</p>

  <p>Then came the period of the UN ultimatum. January 15 was set as the date for Iraq to
  unconditionally withdraw from Kuwait or face military consequences. The very
  formidable, utterly unprecedented deployment of U.S. air and naval forces followed. It
  reached the astonishing number of almost half a million women and men.</p>

  <p>Iraq failed to heed this diktat from the UN Security Council, which had in fact
  acted as the instrument of the collective imperialist powers. So on Jan. 16 the U.S.
  and its principal imperialist coalition co-conspirators opened a massive air assault on
  Iraq.</p>

  <p>The assault's proportions are comparable only to the Nazi Luftwaffe attacks during
  the Second World War. But the current air offensive by the allied imperialist powers
  uses more sophisticated technology. And it is coordinated among the U.S., Britain and
  France. To this very day, these air raids continue. They now number over 80,000
  sorties, carried out on a daily, unremitting, unrelenting basis.</p>

  <p>According to the claims of the allied imperialists, almost all of Iraq's significant
  military installations, so-called biological and chemical weapons centers, and supposed
  nuclear capabilities were either effectively crippled or demolished. Yet there was no
  capitulation by the Iraqi government, nor any significant signs of a break in the
  morale of the embattled Iraqi people.</p>

  <h4>Change in military strategy</h4>

  <p>So another phase of the imperialist assault upon the Iraqi people was begun. Up
  until Feb. 13, the unprecedented massive air assaults on Iraq seemed to be directed
  against military targets. There was, of course, what the imperialist military refers to
  as "collateral damage," meaning civilian casualties. But the civilian casualties, even
  according to the Iraqi government, were not so massive as to convey the impression that
  the U.S. was specifically aiming at civilian targets.</p>

  <p>The air assault of Feb. 13 changed everything. It did not of course change its class
  character, as a war of the leading monopoly capitalist imperialist countries against an
  oppressed people. But it did change the character of the war's conduct from a military
  standpoint.</p>

  <p>For on Feb. 13 the U.S. unleashed an unprecedented massive assault, a pinpoint
  attack by two missiles launched from a Stealth bomber against not a military target,
  but a civilian establishment &mdash; an air raid shelter, no less. The U.S. claim that
  the shelter was a cover for a military outpost was ridiculous on its face.</p>

  <p>It would have been entirely in order, even customary, for the U.S. Air Force to give
  a warning of even a few minutes if not some hours before attacking the facility so its
  inhabitants could vacate the premises. This they failed to do.</p>

  <p>They also failed to answer a reporter's key question at a military briefing: why
  didn't they show the video that supposedly showed military personnel going in and out
  of the bomb shelter? The U.S. military refused to produce the pictures or allow an
  independent investigation of the incident. Within the space of 24 hours it announced
  that its own internal investigation, conducted in secret of course, was over and the
  case closed.</p>

  <h4>British join in with attack on market</h4>

  <p>Thus, the character of the war had changed from attacking military targets to the
  fascist-like mass destruction of the civilian population. Soon the British joined in,
  killing 130 civilians in a market while attacking a bridge supposedly used for military
  purposes. The mass destruction of the civilian population has gone on steadily in the
  week since.</p>

  <p>What is the significance of the swift change from attacking military targets to
  wholesale attacks on the civilian population? It foreshadowed the beginning of a
  genuine genocidal war against Iraq. This was a turning point in the war. It elicited an
  announcement and an offer from the Iraqi government, which for the first time stated it
  would withdraw from Kuwait and offered to begin discussions toward that end.</p>

  <p>The Feb. 13 attack was a deliberate, premeditated move that couldn't be explained
  away. So within the space of a few days, this mass murder carried out by the U.S.
  military against a civilian population all but disappeared from the capitalist media
  here.</p>

  <p>Here it is necessary to recall another so-called military incident that will shed
  considerable light on the meaning of the bloody Feb. 13 attack on the air raid
  shelter.</p>

  <p>It took place toward the close of the Iran-Iraq war when both the belligerents were
  nearing exhaustion.</p>

  <h4>Remember the Iranian airliner?</h4>

  <p>The U.S. had for a considerable period secretly supported the Iraqi side of the war.
  The U.S. aim during the early period of the Iran-Iraq war was to allow both
  belligerents to exhaust themselves in a conflict which could only benefit the
  imperialist ruling classes in the end. But by the summer of 1988, the U.S. had decided
  that its secret support of the Iraqi regime was inadequate for its sordid purposes. And
  it had to send an unmistakable message to Iran that the U.S. was shifting its support
  to Iraq, in order to curb and possibly destroy Iran's economic and political influence
  in the Persian Gulf.</p>

  <p>On July 3, 1988, the USS Vincennes launched a surface-to-air missile at an Iranian
  civilian airliner. It was on a scheduled commercial flight from Bandar-Abbas to Dubai.
  The attack resulted in the deaths of 290 passengers and crew members.</p>

  <p>The U.S. proclaimed the whole thing was an "error" by the crew of the Vincennes. But
  further investigation found no fault and resulted in no punishment. The incident was
  dismissed and forgotten.</p>

  <p>However, it was precisely this act of mass murder of civilians that compelled the
  belligerents in the Iran-Iraq war to call a halt to military hostilities. It
  effectively ended the war.</p>

  <p>The July 3, 1988, mass murder was an attempt by the U.S. to demonstrate that it
  would go to any lengths to achieve its predatory imperialist objectives. It is a
  precise parallel to the Feb. 13 mass murder of civilians in Iraq under a similarly
  veiled cover of a supposed attack on a military target, which showed that the Pentagon
  and White House were at one in the goal of subjugating the Iraqi people to U.S.
  imperialism.</p>

  <p>Up until Feb. 13, the U.S. was unable to subjugate or vanquish the small country of
  Iraq, even though the war conducted by the imperialists was of a collective,
  coordinated character, concentrated on one small country fighting alone.</p>

  <p>Now, had the USSR not abandoned its limited anti-imperialist role and become an
  accomplice to butchering the Iraqi people, the outcome of this struggle might have been
  altogether different. It is questionable whether the imperialists would have been able
  to effectuate their conspiracy and form a coalition. They would have been unable to
  garner the support of the smaller countries. Even the puppet states in the Middle East
  might have hesitated had the Soviet Union taken a forthright stand, vetoed any of the
  U.S.-sponsored resolutions, and begun in earnest an effort to rally the
  anti-imperialist forces. The outcome might have been different.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, the Gorbachev regime was working hand in glove with the U.S. It
  had become beholden to imperialism and in particular to the U.S. as a result of its
  program of instituting capitalist economic reforms under the assumption it would be the
  beneficiary of significant economic and political concessions from the U.S. and the
  other imperialist countries. But the capitalist reforms on which the Gorbachev regime
  staked its position led to one economic disaster after another. They have left the USSR
  in chaos and incredible economic dislocation.</p>

  <p>From the most credit worthy country on the international arena, the USSR has become
  a debtor nation on the scale of Brazil and Argentina. It has received no significant
  economic or monetary concessions from the imperialists. But there has been an unending
  series of attempts to scuttle the socialized sector of the Soviet economy.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev was unable to intervene on behalf of Iraq precisely because he had
  accommodated himself to the needs of the U.S. imperialist ruling class. His recent
  attempt to play the role of mediator, peacemaker, comes late in the day.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev's role in `peace process'</h4>

  <p>So why is the Soviet governing group intervening in the so-called peace process when
  all the world knows it has been a firm pillar of the imperialist alliance? The answer
  lies in the dual character of the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the chaos, disruption, economic dislocation and dismantling of parts
  of Soviet socialist industry and agriculture, it is still nevertheless basically a
  social system that stands in irreconcilable contradiction to predatory imperialism.
  Gorbachev and his collaborators may surely be beholden to the imperialists. But they
  are also at the same time the custodians of a workers' state. They cannot give
  imperialism unlimited license to attack and possibly destroy Iraq and then become the
  supreme plenipotentiary controlling the entire Middle East. They can't completely pave
  the way for the U.S. government to establish a military fortress in Iraq, just 150
  miles from the Soviet border.</p>

  <p>But rather than do the principled thing &mdash; make a complete break with the
  imperialists and ally themselves with the oppressed peoples of the Middle East &mdash;
  the Gorbachev grouping has in fact defected from the anti-imperialist camp. Thereby it
  has weakened the cause of liberation of dozens of countries that suffer under the yoke
  of imperialism. It has also weakened the USSR itself and opened it up to the ravages of
  imperialist economic and financial penetration.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev, in presenting what is now being called a peace plan, is not really a
  mediator between Iraq and the imperialists. A mediator has at least the perfunctory
  appearance of neutrality. Certainly this is true in labor relations. When a big
  stockholder in the company is appointed as mediator, the union rejects the appointment.
  A mediator who is known as a militant trade unionist is rejected by the company. There
  must be at least the external features of neutrality.</p>

  <p>But Gorbachev has not been neutral in this struggle. The USSR under his leadership
  has voted for each one of the infamous UN resolutions directed against an oppressed
  country. He even co-sponsored with the U.S. the very resolution that gave the green
  light to the current imperialist war against Iraq. Even after his foreign minister,
  Eduard Shevardnadze, resigned, Gorbachev affirmed solidarity with the imperialists in
  carrying out the demands on Iraq. How then can he be regarded as a neutral
  mediator?</p>

  <p>In reality, he is a principal prop of the imperialist coalition. Indeed, it is
  altogether doubtful whether the imperialists could have constructed their shaky
  alliance had they not first received support from the USSR governing group and in
  particular Gorbachev himself.</p>

  <p>So why must Iraq deal with the USSR as though it were a neutral, if not an
  altogether friendly, power?</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev "peace plan" doesn't represent so much a fundamental policy change by
  the USSR as an attempt by the governing group to persuade public opinion in the USSR
  that it is seeking a peaceful solution &mdash; that it is somehow still on the opposite
  side from the imperialists who are now preparing for their ground offensive. That
  offensive holds the possibility of destroying the very basis for the existence of the
  Iraqi nation.</p>

  <p>Alarm over the course of the war is beginning to be expressed by the Soviet military
  itself. Gorbachev's military adviser, Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, is reported to have
  criticized the allied bombardments of "the people and the economy" of Iraq. "This can't
  be tolerated any longer," Akhromeyev told the press.</p>

  <p>More critical was General Vladimir Lobov, commander in chief of the Warsaw Pact
  forces. "No one should be allowed to use Security Council resolutions as a smokescreen
  to camouflage the massacre on Iraqi territory," he said.</p>

  <p>The need is greater than ever for the anti-imperialist masses around the world,
  including and especially those in the imperialist countries themselves, to redouble
  their efforts at a time when millions are repelled and angered by the murderous
  bombings.</p>
