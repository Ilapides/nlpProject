  <h1>The second 'Battle of Stalingrad'</h1>

  <h2>Can the forces of imperialist destabilization overcome the forces for
  socialism?</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (May 30, 1991)</h5>

  <p><em>This document was written as a contribution to pre-conference discussion in
  preparation for the Workers World Party Conference coming up on June 1-2.</em></p>

  <p>In previous articles, and also in our book <em>Perestroika: A Marxist Critique,</em>
  we have attempted to present in the most concrete detail the regressive developments in
  the USSR. We demonstrated that the projected reforms of Gorbachev and his group of
  supporters were in fact laying the basis for a capitalist free market which in turn was
  leading towards the dismantling of the central planning system and was steadily
  undermining the foundations for a socialist economy, namely, the public ownership of
  the means of production.</p>

  <p>At the moment, the issue is resolving itself into who will own the means of
  production &mdash; that vast industrial and technological equipment second only to that
  of the U.S. and possibly Japan (remembering that the latter has neither a space
  industry, like the one developed in the USSR over 30 years, nor a nuclear
  capability).</p>

  <p>How striking is the deterioration of the USSR! It is being hailed all over the
  capitalist world as the imminent collapse of the entire social system. Such was
  certainly the view in December 1989, when Eastern Europe was in chaos, the
  counterrevolution was on in Romania, and the swallowing up of the German Democratic
  Republic was already regarded as an accomplished fact. Industrialists and financiers
  everywhere were rubbing their hands in expectation of fabulous profits.</p>

  <h4>Emergence of class struggle in USSR</h4>

  <p>It is now just 18 months later. The great disruption and chaos in the USSR have been
  accompanied by the incipient reemergence of two class camps &mdash; the camp of the
  bourgeois centrist reformers and the outright capitalist restorationists on one side,
  and the camp of the workers, peasants and progressive intelligentsia on the other. The
  latter, however, for the most part remain leaderless and inarticulate. All the earmarks
  of the reemergence of irreconcilable class struggle are present, except for the one
  indispensable element &mdash; a conscious, willing, able and determined proletarian and
  truly socialist leadership.</p>

  <p>Now, 18 months after the beginning of the debacle and tragedy, the imperialist
  ruling classes are beginning to worry. Doubt is creeping through the lines in the
  capitalist press. Dozens of U.S. delegations, undoubtedly packed with CIA agents, are
  rummaging through the USSR. The U.S. has likewise brought over here dozens and dozens
  of its pro-imperialist supporters, writers, artists, politicians and most of all
  economists. Not a single one of these latter shows any affinity to Marxism or any
  understanding of the vicissitudes and contradictions of the capitalist economy.</p>

  <p>As though to humiliate the socialist elements in the USSR, the former foreign
  minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, is in the United States with a horde of his advisers,
  getting together a think tank supported financially by the multimillionaire William
  Garrison.</p>

  <p>How could any government which has been under the gun of the imperialists for so
  many years permit this? It's all in the name of <em>glasnost.</em></p>

  <p>At the moment, virtually all the leading capitalist powers are involved in intense
  consultation and negotiation regarding their strategy to destabilize and overturn the
  USSR. Meetings in London of the Group of Seven (the G7 are the U.S., Britain, Canada,
  France, Germany, Italy and Japan) and in Washington (between Bush and German Chancellor
  Kohl) are taking on a feverish pace as both currents in the bourgeois camp &mdash; the
  centrists led by Gorbachev and the outright restorationists led by Yeltsin &mdash; are
  making frantic appeals for billions in cash to avert what each calls an impending
  catastrophe.</p>

  <p>As we pointed out last week, the two groupings in the USSR have met in secret and
  formed what is virtually a coalition government. Both of them have jointly agreed to
  make immediate appeals to the imperialist financial oligarchy for something in the
  nature of $20-$30 billion. According to the Financial Times of London (May 17), they
  addressed a secret letter to both London and Washington offering to put up a
  substantial part of the USSR's industrial and technological apparatus as collateral
  security for the money. They also expressed willingness to submit to IMF and World Bank
  inspection and supervision of the bourgeois restructuring.</p>

  <p>These reforms, it is said, are another compromise on the part of the Gorbachev
  forces, who earlier had rejected the drastic 500-day plan to speed up the remodeling of
  the USSR along the lines of a capitalist market economy and privatize the publicly
  owned means of production.</p>

  <p>This new compromise is an utterly incredible development. Why then is there no glee
  in the circles of imperialist finance capital? Why is there growing concern and even
  skepticism and fear that the U.S. and its imperialist allies are heading into a
  quagmire of unparalleled proportions?</p>

  <p>If the quagmire is drawn out to its logical and inevitable conclusion, it will,
  <strong>in the context of contemporary world imperialist relationships</strong>,
  constitute a veritable Stalingrad for world imperialism. That was the turning point in
  World War II when the high-tech Nazi armies, having directed their fury against the
  Soviet Union and driven deep into its territory, met their match in the inexhaustible
  resistance of the Soviet masses.</p>

  <p>In order to explain how this could be the outcome of the present situation, it is
  absolutely indispensable to put the U.S. adventure in the Middle East, the Gulf War, in
  its proper perspective.</p>

  <h4>Aftermath of Gulf War</h4>

  <p>Elated over their quick military victory and the devastation of Iraq, the U.S.
  government &mdash; the military-industrial complex and the high command of the Pentagon
  &mdash; has embarked upon a plan of world domination the likes of which no one, even in
  the coldest days of the cold war, thought possible or even desirable.</p>

  <p>This plan is not merely the result of the euphoria of the military brass alone. Nor
  can it be accounted for by the immediate dangers facing the U.S. abroad. After all, the
  so-called peace dividend should have moderated the tone and even somewhat the substance
  of Pentagon planning. But this has not been the case.</p>

  <p>Nor can it be explained as the running wild of a traditional military expenditure
  scheme, calculated to fatten the huge corporations which form an integral part of the
  military-industrial complex.</p>

  <p>Of course, it is true that the military is never satisfied, that it has an
  ever-greater need to modernize as a result of the dizzying development of new
  technology characterizing the present epoch. The speed of this process grows out of the
  virulent competition to develop the most sophisticated weaponry.</p>

  <p>But there is something more basic, something which surpasses the needs and ambitions
  of the military and its partners in the military-industrial complex.</p>

  <h4>Magnitude of the economic crisis</h4>

  <p>It is the emergence of a truly extraordinary economic crisis whose symptoms, evident
  for over three years since the October 1987 stock market crash, are being muffled, even
  talked down. Nevertheless, it is of such staggering proportions that sooner or later it
  must burst through the artificial political restraints binding it.</p>

  <p>For a long, long time, many bourgeois writers, politicians, think tank analysts, and
  the government itself have viewed militarism as a principal stimulant for the economy.
  The Great Depression, it should be remembered, lasted for a decade (1929-39),
  interrupted by only a brief upward spiral in the mid-thirties which had begun to peter
  out by 1939. It was then that the war spending began on a huge scale for the Second
  World War. Then of course came the Korean War, the Vietnam War, many
  counterrevolutionary interventions around the globe like Grenada and Panama, and
  finally the Gulf War.</p>

  <p>The Gulf War was welcomed by almost everyone in the ruling circles of capitalism, in
  virtually the entire business world, as the one bright spot which would provide a
  substantial dose of artificial stimulation to put the capitalist economy on the high
  road to prosperity. There were, of course, misgivings and fears by the more sober
  imperialist strategists regarding the prospects of the war. But the overwhelming
  sentiment in the bourgeoisie and especially among the arms manufacturers was ecstasy
  over the prospect of massive war profits.</p>

  <p>But what has really happened, which the capitalist press so diligently tries to
  cover up? The Gulf War has not stopped the decline of the capitalist economy into
  recession. On the contrary, it has even accelerated it.</p>

  <p>Take for instance, the cutting edge of U.S. industry: high technology. Apple
  Computer, which was experiencing only minimal growth before the war, has recently been
  forced to cut its work force by about 10% &mdash; 1,500 people &mdash; and has embarked
  on a restructuring scheme to slash all its operating expenses in the face of mounting
  financial pressures.</p>

  <p>This is not an isolated phenomenon. The same thing is happening in Compaq,
  Bitstream, IBM and General Dynamics. It is an indubitable sign of economic retreat.</p>

  <p>But there is a still wider indicator, the failure of the housing market to, in the
  words of the Wall Street Journal (May 21), stage a "broad-based comeback." On the
  contrary, it seems that, "to the amazement of some of the real estate industry," the
  one-month recovery quickly fizzled and was only due to "euphoria over the early results
  of the Persian Gulf war."</p>

  <p>While the Wall Street Journal tries to put a good face on it, a study by a private
  firm, the Holt Advisory, dated May 17, 1991, has this to say about the housing
  situation:</p>

  <p>"According to the Census Bureau's most recent tally, there are 10.3 million vacant
  houses, townhomes, apartments and condominiums in this country. That's enormous. The
  Census Bureau also found the highest rate of vacancies in 50 years &mdash; a national
  average of 10% with much higher levels in some areas. For instance, nearly 17% of homes
  in New Orleans were empty in 1990. In Houston, the vacancy rate is 15% and in the
  Dallas-Ft. Worth area it is 13%. Yet we've barely begun to see the impact of the big
  inventories of unsold homes held by the Resolution Trust Corporation, which total
  hundreds of billions of dollars."</p>

  <p>Could there be a bigger scandal than this? Ten million housing units empty when
  there are estimated to be three million homeless, not only in the metropolises but all
  over the country, in cities, towns, villages and rural areas!</p>

  <p>To the hundreds of billions in debt assumed by the government's Resolution Trust,
  add the indebtedness of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation &mdash; and the
  amount becomes even more staggering.</p>

  <h4>Crisis of the banks</h4>

  <p>But these are only two among many important indicators of the true state of the
  capitalist economy. The crux of the problem, however, lies in a longer and deeper
  aspect of capitalist crisis &mdash; the crisis of the banks. This crisis first of all
  made itself felt with what is popularly referred to as the S&amp;L scandal &mdash; a
  gross understatement. Nothing has been so covered up as this very ugly phenomenon. Its
  magnitude is so menacing that neither politicians, industrialists nor bankers are in a
  position to fully reveal it.</p>

  <p>At the beginning it appeared that it would be forgotten after the usual exposure of
  corruption on the part of a few banking officials and a small though significant number
  of senators and representatives in the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats.</p>

  <p>But as more and more bankruptcies were revealed, it became clear that the charges
  and countercharges of corruption were not sufficient to cover up the huge abyss that
  had been opened. There have been failures of big banks in the past &mdash; Continental
  Illinois, Franklin National and Penn Square &mdash; but all of them were overcome in
  time. But what's involved with the S&amp;L debacle is not one or two hundred million
  dollars, not five billion or ten billion, but a number that is perhaps greater than all
  of the previous big bank failures put together &mdash; and still growing. Indeed, the
  numbers that have been floated of late top $500 billion.</p>

  <p>The financial crisis arising from this is so deep that just to handle it politically
  now that the national presidential campaign is beginning holds dangers for the social
  and political system. It will not do, they reckon, to uncover the massive failures and
  look into the abyss. To open this can of worms up to investigation is to invite charges
  of malfeasance, robbery and corruption. But even more frightening to them, it can open
  up the possibility of a social conflict, a true class conflict, especially if at the
  same time one of the biggest of the banks &mdash; Chase Manhattan, Citicorp,
  Manufacturers Hanover, or Chemical, all of which have suffered losses &mdash;
  collapses.</p>

  <p>True, they say there's no danger of a collapse. But the crisis is acute, pushing the
  Federal Reserve Bank to lower interest rates. It is well known that this mechanism
  feeds inflation and riles the leading imperialist partners &mdash; such as Germany,
  whose Chancellor Kohl is presently in the U.S. to discuss all this and more. And the
  meeting of the G7 imperialist countries to deal with all this is turning into one of
  their longest secret sessions ever.</p>

  <h4>New technology and the vulnerability of finance capital</h4>

  <p>In the new stage of imperialism ushered in by the scientific-technological
  revolution, the transfer of funds by the use of electronic technology is swifter and
  more efficient than was dreamed of just a few years ago. This speeds up the circulation
  of capital. In this new stage of imperialism, finance capital &mdash; the nervous
  system of the capitalist economy &mdash; is more endangered than ever before.</p>

  <p>The accumulation of vast oil revenues in the coffers of the big Western banks has
  failed to stabilize the world imperialist system and has impoverished the millions in
  the Middle East to boot. Nawal el-Saadawi, the Egyptian author, told the May 11
  Commission of Inquiry hearing into U.S. war crimes in the Gulf, held in New York, that
  680 billion petrodollars are on deposit in Western banks.</p>

  <p>This $680 billion has been loaned out by the big banks to all the four corners of
  the earth. Huge sums have found their way to Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia, south Korea,
  Singapore, Norway, Sweden, Yugoslavia, Poland &mdash; wherever it was possible to
  unload them. Yet it has exacerbated and not solved the most fundamental of all the
  fundamental contradictions of contemporary capitalism &mdash; the dizzying growth of
  the productive forces, which are collectively produced by hundreds of millions of
  workers but privately owned by a shrinking tiny minority of the super-rich, the
  multimillionaire and billionaire dynasties and financial conglomerates.</p>

  <p>Back on Oct. 19, 1986, the New York Times wrote that the number of billionaires in
  the U.S. had nearly doubled, from 14 to 26 in just one year, thus claiming an
  increasing share of the nation's wealth at the expense of the poor. The richest 5% of
  Americans have more income than the entire bottom 40%. But when assets are considered,
  the richest 1% of Americans possess greater wealth than the bottom 90%.</p>

  <p>But to get back to the most significant, most urgent symptom of this malady &mdash;
  the hundreds of billions of dollars in savings and loan failures and the inability of
  the capitalist government to hide the growing danger that this poses for them.</p>

  <h4>Bankruptcy and the Pentagon</h4>

  <p>This malady of capitalist economic expansion, this symptom of acute crisis, is not
  related in the press or by the capitalist politicians to the unbridled militarism of
  the Pentagon. The looming catastrophe is considered independently of the budget crisis,
  military expenditures and current military policy. They are treated as though one has
  no relationship to the other.</p>

  <p>Instead of showing the intimate connection between military spending and the
  financial crisis, they dwell instead on every penny the capitalist government spends
  for the poor, the disabled, the sick, no matter how paltry and insignificant a sum. The
  mounting financial crisis to prop up the banking system, by perhaps as much as a
  trillion dollars when we count in the Resolution Trust and the FDIC, is never directly
  related to the plans for world domination.</p>

  <p>The plans for world domination are the result of the financial crisis, which in turn
  is a symptom of the crisis of the capitalist economy.</p>

  <h4>Deregulation and the banking system</h4>

  <p>Why is this financial crisis so enormous? In order to fully understand it, it is
  important to grasp the meaning of the regulation of the banking system and of the
  capitalist economy in general.</p>

  <p>There's endless chatter about the free market. The free market, as it developed over
  the years before the emergence of the epoch of monopoly, meant freedom from any and all
  restraints by the capitalist government. Buy and sell freely and the devil take the
  hindmost &mdash; that was the motto of the free market, although it's questionable if
  it ever really existed that way.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter is that no market is truly free, it's only relatively free
  from government restrictions, either at home or abroad. The freedom to trade was
  restricted by the navies and armies of opposing feudal and capitalist governments. The
  development of the capitalist system went hand in hand with restrictions by the
  capitalist state, because without them the capitalist organism could swallow up all
  social and political institutions and make impossible capitalist stability for any
  period.</p>

  <p>Tariffs, quotas, customs duties, taxes of all kinds &mdash; all are restrictions on
  the free market. The market is never totally free, and needs the restrictions for its
  own development. This is a contradiction, but without this contradiction it could not
  develop.</p>

  <p>The relatively free capitalist market existed until about the 1890s. The restriction
  of competition by each of the capitalist countries thereafter inevitably led to a
  forceable solution &mdash; the first imperialist war. At rock bottom its cause was the
  continuing restriction of the world market by capitalist England against rising
  capitalist Germany, which was more efficient technologically and industrially.</p>

  <p>The epoch of free trade in the U.S., as in the other capitalist countries, is to a
  large extent a fiction. The growth of monopoly overtook free trade, which brings us to
  a consideration of the role of the banks in the U.S. They're supposed to be the freest
  of all in the firmament of the capitalist economy. Yet since their earliest days, their
  tendency is to restrict the untrammeled forces of competition in banking and
  finance.</p>

  <p>How did the Federal Reserve system evolve but as a state capitalist instrument for
  moderating competition in the financial markets? This gives more and more leeway to the
  largest banks, allowing them to consolidate by swallowing up the small ones. The
  largest banks have the greatest say in the Federal Reserve, and indeed in the Treasury
  of the United States.</p>

  <p>The capitalist crisis of the 1930s, which followed the stock market crash, made it
  abundantly clear that the various restrictions and prohibitions calculated to limit the
  freedom of the banks to borrow were only minimal and were inadequate to prevent a
  collapse of the banking system as a whole. It was therefore incumbent on the Roosevelt
  administration to reconstruct the banks and the financial system. Thus began the new
  epoch of the regulation of the banks and financial institutions. It led to the birth of
  the FDIC and other instrumentalities of regulation.</p>

  <p>This seemed to suffice until the capitalist crisis that began in the late 1970s
  during the Carter administration. With the very severe recession of 1982-84, there
  began the epoch of deregulation, of loosening all restrictions, as a means of solving
  the capitalist economic crisis.</p>

  <p>While there has been a great deal of literature on the deregulation and
  privatization of companies and segments of entire industries, little attention has been
  paid to the deregulation of the banks. The latter opened wide the doors to anyone and
  everyone to set up a savings bank. They could, on the basis of the government's
  guarantee on deposits up to $100,000, garner in millions with only the most minimal
  amount of capital and legal reserves and the most perfunctory supervision. The
  individual entrepreneur, with few funds but good connections, could get a loan from the
  banks to start a bank! This was an immediate cause of the financial catastrophe that is
  emerging.</p>

  <p>A hundred years ago, a banking crisis growing out of such gargantuan S&amp;L bank
  failures would have resulted in an immediate financial crisis and the closing of banks,
  the suspension of capitalist production, and unemployment on a mass scale. Despite
  terrible hardships for the workers and oppressed masses, it would have nevertheless run
  its course without posing a dangerous class conflict or threatening the existence of
  the capitalist government.</p>

  <p>Only the October 1929 stock market crash, followed by the near-collapse of the
  capitalist system, posed such a danger. It took several years and extraordinary social
  improvements, the product of near-revolutionary struggle by the workers, to ease the
  crisis, which was not really overcome but was diverted by the Second World War.</p>

  <p>Such a crisis is now in the making. That's what the ruling class is grappling with.
  The current recession, while a severe burden on the workers, with homelessness,
  cutbacks in city services, and so on, is not the crisis as such. It is merely a
  harbinger of what is in store. Never before has there been such a vast accumulation of
  problems arising out of the administration of artificial stimulation to the capitalist
  economy.</p>

  <p>Some segments of the financial community have resorted to really desperate measures,
  as shown by the indictments which came down a few years ago against Bank of America and
  other big banks for drug-money laundering on a mass scale.</p>

  <p>Government inspectors have time and time again demanded that more banks be indicted.
  But the government has instead tried to cool the general public with the "Just say no
  to drugs" PR scheme and then by diverting attention to Panama, which meant embarking on
  a cruel invasion, the destruction of the government and the kidnapping of its leader.
  The end result is that the banks have free rein to deal in the drug trade.</p>

  <h4>Europe on the `brink of recession'</h4>

  <p>The capitalist crisis is worldwide in character. This is not adequately conveyed by
  the capitalist press. However, on April 16 the New York Times finally had this to say:
  "A year ago as the U.S. was sliding toward recession, many European officials boasted
  that the European Community, spurred by German unification, would take over as the
  locomotive of the world economy. Instead, today Western Europe's economy has stalled
  with the Persian Gulf crisis pushing much of the Continent, already weakened to the
  brink of recession."</p>

  <p>Thus, while many multinationals ran to Europe as a haven from the capitalist crisis
  in the U.S., they found the opposite was true. Furthermore, the swallowing up of the
  GDR by imperialist West Germany has placed a heavy financial burden on Germany as a
  whole and accelerated its economic decline. This has diminished the presumed role of
  the FRG as a lender of funds to the USSR.</p>

  <p>The high hopes and tall promises immediately following the destruction of the GDR as
  an independent country have fallen on bad times. Now the Bonn government is looking for
  a way for the World Bank and the IMF to play a role in the unification &mdash; all the
  result of the attempt of German capital to play the role of supreme organizer of
  Europe.</p>

  <p>The money laid out for the Gulf War has further debilitated the German economy. So
  while U.S. imperialism is trying to make greater demands on Germany, the latter has
  come to Washington to make demands upon the U.S. It all heightens the contradictions
  within the imperialist camp.</p>

  <p>All of this seems to hinge on the development of the European Economic Community,
  which is supposed to become the example par excellence of a community organizing a free
  market. However, it is anything but free from the multinational corporations. At the
  present moment, it is the site of a ferocious struggle between Ford and General Motors,
  in which for the first time in years Ford is losing ground to General Motors while the
  latter is losing its market share in the U.S. as a result of the recession.</p>

  <p>Nor is there the least letup in the ferocious competition inside the European
  Community among the giant corporations, first of all the auto manufacturers of France,
  Germany, Britain and Italy. This competition will not enhance the purchasing power of
  the broad mass of the workers of the European Community but will add to the oncoming
  cutbacks and layoffs.</p>

  <p>The only question is whether they can use the EEC to ward off the sharp competition
  from Japan. Edith Cresson, the new French Prime Minister appointed by Mitterrand, has
  opened up a racist attack upon Japan of the type prevalent in the U.S. just a few years
  ago. But this will not diminish the competition.</p>

  <p>The widest and deepest impact of the economic crisis on the masses is seen on the
  Indian subcontinent. The economic devastation has heightened the political struggle and
  the struggle of the workers and peasants to the highest level since independence. It is
  the fear that India may be in the midst of a pre-revolutionary crisis that at least in
  part has impelled the Pentagon to dispatch a military instead of civilian relief
  mission to Bangladesh. It is also done with a view to sharpen the antagonisms between
  India and Pakistan. Even more, it is calculated with a view towards eliminating the
  special relationship which has existed between India and the USSR both as trading
  partners and as allies in what at least until now has been partially an
  anti-imperialist alliance.</p>

  <h4>An Orwellian picture of world domination</h4>

  <p>This growing world crisis has propelled the U.S. military-industrial complex, its
  politicians and bankers, to extend U.S. dominion on a truly global scale. To do this
  they have embarked upon a military program which will far, far exceed anything that has
  been seen before.</p>

  <p>Their plans conjure up an Orwellian picture of U.S. domination in every corner of
  the earth. Instead of retrenching, instead of cutting back the military establishment,
  they are proceeding in the very opposite direction. They are laying the groundwork for
  this attempt by fortifying their military capacity. ("Now that we're the only
  superpower in the world, we can do what we want.")</p>

  <p>The result is political pressure to try and extinguish the contradictions which
  continue to rend asunder the world capitalist economy while forcibly constructing a
  coordinated, integrated world economy in which the U.S. is the central player and
  dominant force. That's the new world order, in economic terms.</p>

  <p>Where is there any hope that the financial crisis can be ameliorated? Where is there
  any realistic expectation that the contradictions arising from the search for
  super-profits can be solved on the basis of establishing a so-called coordinated global
  economy?</p>

  <p>Look at the vague and generally unenforceable agreement arrived at by the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trades after three long years of squabbling. It was finally
  torpedoed by the U.S. government itself. If there ever was an object lesson in the
  failure of the bourgeois order to sponsor world economic cooperation, this was it. It
  was doomed to failure from the beginning.</p>

  <p>The new world order scheme is buttressed by a new U.S. military strategy which is
  shifting to large-scale mobile forces capable of reaching any corner of the earth's
  surface in the shortest time with the most sophisticated military equipment able to
  repeat and improve on the kind of devastation caused in Iraq.</p>

  <p>This strategy goes back to the days of the rapid deployment force during the Carter
  administration, and has steadily been updated. It engages the eagerness and the
  aptitude of the principal arms manufacturers of the U.S., notwithstanding the poisonous
  competition among them.</p>

  <h4>Why the cold war isn't over</h4>

  <p>They're saying that the cold war is over, that communism has been defeated, that the
  principal enemy has been vanquished. So why then is it necessary to launch an
  unprecedented military program? It is of course for military purposes. But for what
  other purpose? The whole program is to avoid a recession.</p>

  <p>Why did the Department of Defense sign a contract for a new plane &mdash; the F-22
  &mdash; to replace the F-15 Eagle, which is the Air Force's primary fighter? It will
  cost an estimated $95-$100 billion for 650 planes, according to the May 14 Science
  Section of the New York Times.</p>

  <p>The contract is awarded to Lockheed, which will share it with General Dynamics and
  Boeing and keep in business several hundred subcontractors. Will the losing bidder, the
  Northrop Corporation, and its team of contractors, which includes General Electric,
  quietly close their tents and go out of business because they lost a $95-$100 billion
  contract after years of planning for it?</p>

  <p>No one with the slightest knowledge of the military-industrial complex, the
  poisonous competition for profits, and the enormous clout of these companies within the
  inner circles of the government will believe that one of these giant pillars of
  militarism will suddenly go out of business. That is sheer nonsense. A consensus among
  the giants in the U.S. weapons business will find a way for the losing bidders not to
  convert to peaceful production but to reengage in the weapons business. It is the most
  lucrative of all, especially when there's a most eager procurement arm of an even more
  willing Defense Department and president.</p>

  <p>The B-2 stealth bomber, which is now in production, will cost another $70 billion.
  What are they preparing for? The Defense Department is at wit's end trying to prove
  there's a need for all this.</p>

  <p>Why, for instance, was it so urgently necessary that military forces, without being
  requested, bring relief to Bangladesh? Wasn't one of its real objectives to show the
  value of an up-to-date, speedy, most efficient and technologically developed military
  force? And what about the cynical game the Pentagon always plays when it needs
  increased expenditures &mdash; scaring the wits out of small-town officials with base
  closings, that raise the specter of ghost towns?</p>

  <p>The destructive firepower used by the U.S. military against Iraq, on a magnitude
  greater than that dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, has given wide currency to the
  illusion that sophisticated high technology is decisive for military victory. This is
  just a caricature of the Marxist concept on the role of the productive forces in
  determining economic, social and political conditions over a period of time. It is the
  productive forces which ultimately change class relations and lay the basis for a
  transition from a lower to a higher social system.</p>

  <p>But to say that high technology, which is a productive force, is decisive in modern
  warfare, while leaving out the fact that the masses are the greatest productive force,
  is not only to accept the braggadoccio of the imperialist military but flies in the
  face of historical experience.</p>

  <h4>High technology warfare</h4>

  <p>High technology is decisive where there is a social equilibrium between the warring
  classes or warring nations and the only fundamental difference lies in a superior
  weapons system. That is not what happened in the Gulf War. Had the political situation
  been more favorable for the oppressed, then the military outcome would also have been
  different.</p>

  <p>The Gulf War was carried out by a collective of all the imperialist powers. They
  knew each and every modern factory, every power plant, every weapons system in Iraq,
  down to the last nut and bolt. That's one fundamental difference.</p>

  <p>The other difference lies of course in the large number of people the imperialists
  were able to mobilize in the West against a tiny country. The masses in the imperialist
  metropolitan countries remained passive during the war, while Iraq's urgent appeals to
  the masses on the Arabian peninsula for revolutionary support and a struggle against
  the puppet regimes received a limited response. Under these circumstances the vicious
  blockade, which was as tight as a drum, was decisive.</p>

  <p>These factors were not decisive, however, during the imperialist intervention
  against the Russian Revolution in 1919-21. The 14 invading imperialist powers had
  infinitely higher technological resources than the new Soviet government. But the
  adventure proved a failure. The revolutionary workers and peasants were more than a
  match for the technology and forces gathered by the imperialists.</p>

  <p>The Korean War proved the same thing, especially because it got internationalist
  support from the People's Liberation Army of China and material assistance from the
  USSR. And of course the Vietnamese struggle was a magnificent demonstration of the
  efficacy of people's war against a technologically vastly superior imperialist
  enemy.</p>

  <p>The Gulf War provoked a new round of deadly competition in the military-industrial
  complexes of the imperialist countries in the further development of high technology,
  particularly in missiles. The competition for a more accurate class of Patriot missiles
  will cost hundreds of millions of dollars in order to forestall a new generation of
  SCUD missiles.</p>

  <p>The French, whose Exocet missile proved itself in the Malvinas (Falklands) war, and
  was used in a limited way in the Gulf war, will unquestionably spend more millions of
  francs to make it the preferred missile in the arms market.</p>

  <h4>Robert Gates: a return to the Dulles brothers?</h4>

  <p>In order to garner public support for a new round of military spending, the
  capitalist press is reviving the old scare story regarding the USSR, China and the
  Third World. There may be plenty for them to think about as to whether the capitalist
  reforms ever will succeed in overturning the socialist basis of the USSR, but in the
  meantime it is necessary to make sure that it is still seen as the enemy and a
  continuing threat.</p>

  <p>So what do we find at this particular time, when the banking system is moving
  towards a bankruptcy crisis, possibly evoking the specter of another 1929? We find that
  Bush, in his search for a new CIA director, has come upon Robert Gates. Gates is one of
  those real insiders who for long periods of time rarely appears in public. He's a
  specialist on the Soviet Union best known for his hard line on the USSR and whose
  merit, says Zbigniew Brzezinski, is that he "had a very skeptical prognosis for
  Gorbachev when the Reagan administration was plunging into a love affair with him" (New
  York Times, May 15).</p>

  <p>Gates, says the Times, "regarded the East-West competition as a fundamental struggle
  over the roles of citizens and states." This brings back memories of the cold war at
  its very worst. In florid language, the struggle was characterized as between the state
  and the individual. Of course in the West, said these great analysts from their
  Olympian heights, the individual is primary and the state serves the individual, while
  in the Soviet Union it is the reverse.</p>

  <p>Gates is just the type of man for that philosophical view. In a paper he delivered
  in 1983, Gates asserted that the struggle between the U.S. and the USSR is not just
  "over weaponry or markets or a misunderstanding from World War II." What was it about?
  "The threat posed by the Soviet Union &mdash; by Russia &mdash; is the lineal
  descendant of the same threat Western civilizations have faced for three and a half
  thousand years: It is the threat posed by despotisms against the more or less steadily
  developing concept that the highest goal of the state is to protect and foster the
  creative capabilities and the liberties of the individual."</p>

  <p>Who are these individuals? The millions who are homeless, who've lost their jobs,
  who have no health care or hope for a decent education? Does he mean the individual
  workers, who make up the bulk of the population?</p>

  <p>We are now back to the McCarthy period in foreign affairs, for the language is that
  of the Dulles brothers &mdash; John Foster Dulles, the Secretary of State, and his
  brother Alan, the CIA director &mdash; spoken in the same philosophic-religious cant.
  It evokes the image of the Eastern "hordes," beginning with the invasion of the
  Mongols. It includes China and all Asia, and by extension Latin America and Africa as
  well. That is why it is necessary to have a military strategy to shift large-scale
  mobile forces on a regional basis.</p>

  <p>This was the kind of thinking that led the Nazi commanders to believe they could
  overwhelm the USSR in 1943 at Stalingrad, but instead they were swallowed up by the
  resistance of the Soviet masses.</p>

  <h4>Profits: the elusive bottom line</h4>

  <p>What remains elusive for the bourgeoisie is that definitive victory of capitalism
  over socialism which would bring in its train the huge super-profits they so
  desperately seek.</p>

  <p>Look at what is happening in Congress. They're haggling over a billion and a half
  dollars in credits to the USSR, so it can purchase grain. And whose grain? Not from
  Australia or Argentina or Europe, but from the United States. Yet it will take
  virtually all the arms of the capitalist state to push the grain deal through, if it
  ever happens. What is the insurmountable obstacle?</p>

  <p>Before Gorbachev took over, the USSR was the most credit-worthy nation on the face
  of the globe. It met the supreme requirements as far as the banks are concerned. It
  could pay the interest on time and the principal on demand.</p>

  <p>All lending transactions boil down to this: Can the debtor make timely payments on
  the interest and/or principal?</p>

  <p>The USSR is now in debt to the tune of some $50 billion. (It's hard to get an
  accurate figure.) That in itself, however, would not be a big problem for such a vast
  country blessed with so many natural resources &mdash; a super-rich country, as Boris
  Yeltsin calls it.</p>

  <p>What is so remarkable is that it is unable, at the present time, to pay either the
  principal or &mdash; and this is vital &mdash; the interest. That is why both Gorbachev
  and the restorationist grouping are making a desperate plea to the G7 for something in
  the nature of $30 billion, and are willing to put portions of the industrial,
  technological-scientific, and maybe even the military establishment in hock as
  collateral security for the loans. This is insanity. It is the action of a desperate
  grouping unable to find a way out except through the pawnbroker.</p>

  <p>But the pawnbroker, with his vast experience in extortion, must always know where
  and when to extend the cash. The oligarchy of international capitalist finance is
  holding back. And this time it's not for political reasons. It's due almost wholly to
  the ordinary processes of capitalist investment. If the USSR cannot pay the interest
  after the imperialist banks have loaned them some $50 billion, how could they pay back
  on another installment of $30 or more billion?</p>

  <p>The USSR is not an underdeveloped country. Right now, Soviet astronauts are circling
  the globe and have taken along a British astronaut (Britain not having a space
  industry). It's a highly developed country, but it has been vastly mismanaged and
  wrecked by a bourgeois grouping intent on establishing a capitalist social order.</p>

  <p>Now voices are being heard from the USSR saying they cannot institute a capitalist
  order of society without imperialist financial support and intervention. Originally,
  the transformation to a capitalist system was to be a do-it-yourself project. The
  imperialist ruling classes were only to give encouragement, make sure they did not
  militarily obstruct the progress, and lift the most onerous economic restrictions.</p>

  <p>But now the bourgeois grouping is begging, "We need your support." The capitalists,
  on the other hand, are saying, "We can supply you with some loans, but you must pay
  back the interest and principal on time."</p>

  <p>Imperialist investments have to bring in super-profits, not in the dim future, but
  on a quarterly basis. Failing all that, the capitalists are having second thoughts,
  much to their own surprise. The very objective of all the counterrevolutionary activity
  was to begin a process that would end with maximum super-profits. But this prospect is
  dimmed by the inability of the bourgeois stratum in the USSR to overturn the system on
  the strength of its own forces.</p>

  <p>What U.S. imperialism and the European capitalists are beginning to realize is that
  what they would acquire in a new, "free" Russia would be another Brazil, made even more
  difficult by the fact that it is a highly industrialized country.</p>

  <p>From the immediate point of view of super-profit, it's not there. The imperialists
  would gain a victory only from the point of view of the sociological or geopolitical
  struggle. But from the point of view of profit and loss, it is another Third World,
  debt-ridden country. And most of the debt has accumulated just in the past six years,
  since Gorbachev took over.</p>

  <p>How dismayed are the bourgeois economists, like Grigory A. Yavlinsky, one of the
  authors of the 500-day conversion plan, who is now at Harvard University drafting a
  program with which he hopes to enlist the support of the Group of Seven. Says the New
  York Times (May 22), "Mr. Yavlinsky insisted that money was not the critical issue. ...
  Nonetheless, money was likely to be the sticking point among the Western powers,
  however sympathetic they might be to the greater goal. With the United States in
  recession, Germany facing huge bills for its eastern part, and bills from the Persian
  Gulf war still coming in, the notion of pumping billions into the Soviet Union met with
  little enthusiasm."</p>

  <h4>Time for new leadership</h4>

  <p>The bourgeois intellectuals and economists in the USSR thought, once their plan for
  restructuring went through, that they'd be able to put across the capitalist reforms
  without any negative response from the masses. But once the price increases and
  unemployment were felt, so was mass resistance.</p>

  <p>Their next thought was to get the West to lend them the capital, so they wouldn't
  have to take on the masses. Hence, Gorbachev's appeal in the United Nations in
  September 1988 about universal human values, how all trade restrictions should be
  removed, etc. Some of the big so-called private commercial banks did lend money, about
  $50 billion, but it didn't help.</p>

  <p>So a big struggle is opening up in the USSR. It's a quagmire for the imperialists,
  especially since it comes in a period of great economic crisis for them.</p>

  <p>This gives the working class in the USSR time to reorient itself. It means there is
  time for a new leadership to emerge. The decisive struggle is still ahead.</p>
