  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Kurdistan (April 18, 1991)</title>

  <h1>Kurdistan</h1>

  <h2>The struggle in historical perspective</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 18, 1991)</h5>

  <p>Several years ago, when I was in the Mid-Manhattan branch of the New York Public
  Library looking up something in the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica,</em> a Third World
  student passed by, glanced at the book, and said to me rather pointedly, "This book
  ought to be burned." He walked on. It astonished me. Then suddenly he turned around,
  smiled, and said, "Well, not really."</p>

  <p>The other day, when I was attempting to find the exact date of the founding of the
  People's Republic of Kurdistan, I looked in the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica,</em> 1980
  edition. To my surprise, there's no listing for Kurdistan, or even the word Kurds.</p>

  <p>It could have easily been sandwiched in between the Kunlun Mountains and Akiro
  Kurosawa, the Japanese film director. But it wasn't there.</p>

  <p>The <em>New York Times Encyclopedic Almanac</em> of 1972, which claims on its jacket
  to be "the most complete and authoritative reference annual ever published for home,
  school and office," likewise has no listing for the Kurds or Kurdistan.</p>

  <p>Nothing so much offends the sensibilities of oppressed people as ignoring their very
  existence in art, literature and above all history.</p>

  <h4>Imperialist distortion of history</h4>

  <p>This is one of the many, many examples of how historic issues of great significance
  are either mangled, distorted or completely omitted by imperialist historiography. This
  is carried to an extreme in the daily capitalist press, not to speak of the electronic
  media.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the U.S. public can be ambushed by a sudden avalanche of lies and deceit
  whose influence the ordinary person can scarcely avoid, as for instance with the U.S.
  aggression in the Persian Gulf.</p>

  <p>At the moment, it seems that all stops have been pulled out to demonstrate the
  humanitarianism and generosity of the Bush administration in its airlift of food to
  hundreds of thousands of Kurdish people in the stricken areas. Soon a whole group of
  charitable organizations will be setting up events, probably with many distinguished
  entertainers, etc., to raise funds for the suffering Kurds. All of it is calculated to
  show the despotism and cruelty of the Iraqis as against the poor, friendless, stateless
  Kurdish people, who have been abandoned by all the world except for a handful of
  imperialist powers.</p>

  <p>What is the truth? Would the Kurdish people of Iraq have opened up military
  operations against the Iraqi government, provoking an onslaught against them, had it
  not been for the U.S. government and the CIA &mdash; as is publicly admitted today?
  [See article on page 8.]</p>

  <p>Is the U.S. government really concerned about the Kurdish people? Are Britain,
  France, Germany or Turkey?</p>

  <p>It is impossible to consider the plight of the Kurdish people without taking into
  account some of the salient facts of the modern era, beginning with World War I. In the
  midst of the war, France, Britain and czarist Russia made a secret agreement, the
  Sykes-Picot treaty, which among other things included Kurdistan in its framework.</p>

  <p>"... [T]he British envisaged a series of autonomous Kurdish states <strong>to be
  advised by British political officers</strong> which the French were to be asked to
  concede in the Wilsonian spirit of self-determination for the Kurdish people." (From
  <em>A Peace to End All Peace</em> by David Fromkin, Avon Books, New York, 1990. Our
  emphasis.)</p>

  <p>The war of 1914-18 was an imperialist war to redivide the world to correspond to the
  new relationships among the great capitalist powers. It ended not only in the defeat of
  Germany but in the liquidation of the Ottoman Empire. That gave U.S. President Woodrow
  Wilson an opportunity, according to U.S. historians, to plead for self-determination,
  especially for non-Turkish nationalities in the empire. That's how the Kurdish question
  was brought to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, on the initiative of the Kurds.</p>

  <p>Wilson is often depicted as an idealist who sought to bring about a new progressive
  world order, in which the oppressed nationalities would be able to gain their
  independence. But this is pure bourgeois bunk. The basic idea was to break up the
  Turkish state in such a way as to make it unviable as a leading power, either in Europe
  or in the Middle East.</p>

  <p>The terms imposed upon Germany, which were harsh enough, nevertheless enabled German
  imperialism to revive industrially and technologically. Turkey, however, remains to
  this day mired as a compradore bourgeois state and vassal of the Western imperialist
  powers.</p>

  <p>The Paris Peace Conference was followed by the Sevres Treaty of 1921 which actually
  liquidated the Ottoman Empire and did in words call for the creation of an autonomous
  Kurdish state. The Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, however, made no mention of Kurdistan.
  Bourgeois historians dwell at length on these diplomatic developments, their viewpoint
  corresponding to the interests of the particular imperialist power they speak for.</p>

  <p>None of this would alter the plight of the masses of Kurdistan in any real measure.
  However, there was one truly great and momentous event which changed the face of all
  Asia and gave the Kurds, like other peoples, an impetus to rise from abject poverty and
  semi-slavery and seek real freedom. That was the Bolshevik Revolution.</p>

  <h4>Bolshevik Revolution and Asia</h4>

  <p>The Bolshevik Revolution stirred the Western proletariat to the point of
  insurrection in Germany and Hungary. It also aroused the latent energy of millions and
  millions of oppressed people living under the yoke of imperialism and feudal
  despotism.</p>

  <p>After the war, all the predatory imperialist powers, adopting Wilsonian rhetoric,
  were given to endless platitudes about self-determination and protection of national
  minorities. But in fact none were really for self-determination of oppressed peoples
  anywhere in the world. The First World War in and of itself did not change the
  conditions of exploitation and national oppression by the imperialist powers or
  eliminate enslavement by feudal despotism.</p>

  <p>Had the Russian Revolution remained at the level of February 1917, had it become
  even the best of bourgeois democratic states, it would not have had any real historic
  significance in Asia. But the February Revolution was superseded by another kind of
  revolution in October, a revolution of the working class in alliance with the
  peasantry, a proletarian revolution. It was the sparks of that revolution that began to
  burn in Asia.</p>

  <p>Self-determination was not a platitude of the Leninist government. It was for real.
  Notwithstanding all the lies and slanders of the imperialist bourgeoisie, it reached
  down to the masses and inspired them by the millions.</p>

  <p>By that alone, the Bolshevik Revolution would have been a momentous development in
  history. But the Bolsheviks did not just promote self-determination. They were the
  carriers of irreconcilable class warfare. This is the <em>sine qua non</em> that
  fundamentally changed class relations in Asia, contributing to the great Chinese
  Revolution and the heroic revolutions in Vietnam, Korea and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>It is in this connection that we should consider the situation of the people of
  Kurdistan. The Bolshevik Revolution sparked the ultimate rise of the Tudeh Party in
  Iran. And while the most immediate and fundamental concern of the oppressed peoples in
  the Middle East was self-determination, the Bolshevik Revolution opened the war of the
  oppressed against their age-old native oppressors.</p>

  <h4>Communism and a Kurdish state</h4>

  <p>It would have been a monumental development had the Kurdish communists been able to
  carry out a determined revolutionary struggle of the oppressed people, of the peasants
  against the landlords, in the same way that it was carried out in China and later in
  Vietnam.</p>

  <p>One difficulty was that the Kurdish people were spread out in parts of east Turkey,
  northeast Iraq and northwest Iran, with smaller groupings in Syria and what is now
  Soviet Armenia. But more important was the retreat in the Soviet Union from its
  revolutionary internationalist position in the global class struggle.</p>

  <p>However, even in the most difficult days of the Soviet Union's struggle for
  existence during World War II, the communist movement as such in the Middle East, and
  particularly in Iran, was not disintegrated. This explains the existence of what is
  scornfully referred to by bourgeois, pro-imperialist historians as the "Soviet-backed
  Kurdish `Republic.' " (<em>New Columbia Encyclopedia,</em> 1975 edition.)</p>

  <p>The Kurdish Republic of Mahabad existed from December 1945 to December 1946 in the
  northern part of Iran. Its proclaimed program included, among other demands: "The
  Kurdish people in Iran should have freedom and self-government in the administration of
  their local affairs and obtain autonomy within the limits of the Iranian state. The
  Kurdish language should be used in education and be the official language in
  administrative affairs" (Manifesto by Qazi Mohammad and 105 leading Kurds).</p>

  <p>The program was modest enough. It didn't go beyond autonomy within the limits of the
  Iranian state.</p>

  <p>Its real significance lies in the fact that the republic was established and
  constituted the nucleus of a future state of Kurdistan. It was the first and only state
  that the Kurdish people have ever had. Its establishment opened a new era for the
  Kurds. It opened the possibility of obtaining real independence.</p>

  <p>It showed great promise of uniting the Kurds, or at least becoming a cultural center
  for Kurdish people in other parts of the Middle East and Asia. One can scorn it, revile
  it, lie about it, diminish its significance, but in all the centuries since the Kurds
  as a people have existed, it was the first time that they established a state of their
  own.</p>

  <h4>Overthrow of Kurdish republic</h4>

  <p>What happened to it? Was there an internal counter-revolution? Or did the Iranian
  government on its own under the Shah, then a puppet of British imperialism, overthrow
  it? No, neither of these things.</p>

  <p>What happened was that the Truman administration, in collaboration with the British,
  gave notice to the Soviet Union that its troops had to evacuate Iran. It was one of the
  first salvos of the cold war. After their withdrawal, the Shah, armed by U.S.
  imperialism, opened a military struggle to destroy the Kurdish republic.</p>

  <p>There are very few English-language accounts of what happened. The most detailed one
  is by Archie Roosevelt, Jr., who served the U.S. government as assistant military
  attache in Teheran from March 1946 to February 1947. In the <em>Middle East
  Journal</em> of July 1947 (vol. 1, no. 3) he wrote, "The dream of Kurdish nationalists,
  an independent Kurdistan, was realized on a miniature scale in Iran from December 1945
  to December 1946. The origin of the little Kurdish republic, its brief and stormy
  history and its sudden collapse is one of the more illuminating stories of the
  contemporary Middle East."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he does little to throw light on the driving forces behind the
  establishment of the Kurdish Republic of Mahabad. He dwells on inter-tribal struggles
  and paints the role of the communists in the most lurid colors as nothing but Soviet
  secret agents.</p>

  <p>Whatever one may think of the Kurdish republic of Mahabad as a form of
  self-determination, it cannot be denied that it became the center of gravity, the pole
  of attraction for the people of Kurdistan.</p>

  <p>No one could have predicted the future of this republic in the light of the
  international situation. It was wartime. British soldiers were at one end and Soviet
  forces at the other. Had the Allied powers agreed to a policy whereby both their forces
  and those of the USSR would withdraw from the area, there would have been an historic
  opportunity to test whether the Kurdish Republic of Mahabad was the appropriate form of
  self-determination for the Kurdish people. There may conceivably have been other
  variants. But no opportunity was afforded.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to assess the current political position of the Kurdish people in
  Iraq and its relation to Iran, Syria, and Turkey without understanding the background
  of the struggle, particularly as it began to emerge immediately after the Bolshevik
  revolution.</p>

  <h4>Ba'thism and the socialist perspective</h4>

  <p>It is the socialist perspective, the perspective of the overthrow of imperialism and
  capitalism, that has to be borne in mind as the aggression and plundering of the Middle
  East by the imperialists continues.</p>

  <p>Not a day goes by without some new maneuver, some new stance by this or that
  imperialist power or group. But while the U.S. military machine, in alliance with its
  imperialist partners, was able to crush Iraq militarily by inflicting vast and
  incalculable destruction, it has by no means vanquished the people, nor has the regime
  itself been overthrown.</p>

  <p>Whether it was for propagandistic or stategic ends, this was one of the main stated
  objectives of the Bush administration. It was Bush himself who in early February
  publicly called for the Iraqi military and Iraqi people to "take matters into their own
  hands and force Saddam Hussein to step aside." That hasn't happened.</p>

  <p>The problem in the Middle East from the viewpoint of socialism is that in all the
  political overturns, all the struggles to rid the region of imperialism, none went
  beyond the level of the February Revolution in Russia. The most profound revolution,
  that in Egypt led by Nasser, shows the limits of what can be achieved if the revolution
  stops at the bourgeois-democratic level. The Iraqi Revolution of 1958 is another
  example.</p>

  <p>These progressive, anti-imperialist revolutions were unable to achieve a transition
  to a socialist revolution, one that overturns the basic relations of property between
  the working class and peasants on the one side, and the bourgeoisie on the other,
  between oppressors and oppressed. What emerged instead was the phenomenon of Ba'athism,
  which is an eclectic form combining some progressive, or, if you will, socialist
  measures with the retention of the bourgeoisie as a class.</p>

  <p>Mere nationalization of industry, even of oil, does not in and of itself lay the
  basis for socialism. The nationalization retains within itself the growth of the
  bourgeoisie. While the level of economic wellbeing can be on a much higher level than
  in a non-oil-producing country, the retention of the bourgeoisie leads to gross social
  inequality. In the light of the bourgeoisie's international connections with
  imperialism, the country ultimately succumbs to its domination.</p>

  <h4>Bonapartism in Syria and Iraq</h4>

  <p>Ba'thism has produced Bonapartist regimes in Syria and, more pertinently, in Iraq.
  The present ruling group in Iraq is avowedly Ba'thist in its social program. A
  characteristic feature of such a regime is that it straddles the fence between the
  working class and peasants on the one hand, and the bourgeoisie. The severe pressure of
  imperialism has produced the phenomenon of military rule and a number of coups
  d'etat.</p>

  <p>In the struggle against imperialism, it leans heavily on the workers and peasants as
  its fundamental social support. At the same time, the pressure of bourgeois social
  forces continually pushes it in an adverse direction.</p>

  <p>The oppression of national minorities is a product of this pressure. Oppression of
  national minorities is consistent with bourgeois interests; it is alien to the
  socialist objectives of the working class. Therein lies the contradiction of
  Ba'thism.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, oppressed people such as the Kurds, in the conditions of
  imperialist attack upon Iraq, have the absolute duty to support the Iraqi regime
  against imperialism or see their standing in the community of oppressed nations
  completely nullified and themselves reduced to the status of a tool of imperialism.
  Here again, the adage which applies to Iraq applies also to the Kurds: No nation can
  itself be free if it helps imperialism oppress another nation.</p>

  <p>Wherever Ba'athism has prevailed, it has of course been of a progressive character
  in relation to outright bourgeois or feudal political domination. But it is a barrier
  to socialist revolution. It retains the fundamentals of bourgeois rule. The mere
  existence of a proletariat and a bourgeoisie proves this.</p>

  <p>Politically, it makes it enormously difficult for a communist party to function,
  even where it is legally possible for it to exist and organize in its own name. But
  more often than not, the party has succumbed to the wiles of Ba'thism. This has meant
  either being a cooperating element within the political structure, often retaining a
  program that does not in effect differ from that of the governing Ba'thist party, or,
  should it seek an independent revolutionary road, being suppressed by force and
  violence.</p>

  <p>The pressure of imperialism on a continuing and more intensive level has created all
  sorts of phenomena that hinder the development of the class struggle. No nation can be
  free if it oppresses others. Turkey can never be free as long as it oppresses the Kurds
  or other peoples. The same applies to Iran and also to Iraq.</p>

  <p>This generalization is not limited to the Kurds. It's a worldwide phenomenon. Sri
  Lanka was oppressed by India, which itself was long oppressed and continues to be
  dependent to some extent on Anglo-U.S. imperialism. But Sri Lanka has been unable to
  grant self-determination and freedom to the Tamils, for instance. All this is a product
  of the irreconcilable class contradictions which prevail in contemporary imperialist
  global relations.</p>

  <h4>No substitute for proletarian solidarity</h4>

  <p>Only a worldwide socialist federation, based on the abolition of class rule and
  exploitation, can put an end to national oppression. Self-determination alone,
  independence alone, without touching the foundations of class rule, is absolutely
  inadequate to deal with the monstrous growth of the imperialist economic colossus.</p>

  <p>Only the reconstruction of society into a socialist commonwealth, free of the
  violent paroxysms of competition which lead to armed warfare and imperil all humanity,
  will put an end to racial, national and class oppression.</p>

  <p>There is no substitute for proletarian, socialist solidarity in the struggle against
  capitalism and imperialism. It is the only hope for humanity as a whole.</p>
