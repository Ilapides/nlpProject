  <h1>Pavlov's bbbbelt-tightening remedy</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 11, 1991)</h5>

  <p>April 2 &mdash; The crisis in the USSR deepens with every passing day. The
  counterrevolutionary elements led by Boris Yeltsin, his emissary Stanislav Shatalin
  (now in the U.S.), Grigory Yavlinsky and the others get bolder and more impudent as
  Mikhail Gorbachev continues to vacillate, shrinking from taking measures that can
  effectively deal with the counterrevolution.</p>

  <p>An invaluable insight into the process of disintegration was given by USSR Prime
  Minister Valentin Sergeyevich Pavlov in an interview given to Trud, organ of the trade
  unions, and published Feb. 12. Excerpts are translated in the March 13 <em>Current
  Digest of the Soviet Press</em>.</p>

  <h4>50% drop in production in January</h4>

  <p>Pavlov tells us that "in January, production dropped by 50% in relation to the
  preceding year. This means that more than 4% of annual production was lost last month.
  If we don't check this breakdown, by March we will be in such a slump that society will
  be on the brink of ruin."</p>

  <p>The drop in production, especially such a steep one, cannot be explained on the
  basis of a lack of demand or earlier overproduction. It can only be explained on the
  basis of deliberate sabotage. But let us go further.</p>

  <p>Prime Minister Pavlov, asked about the basic reasons for his financial policy, says
  it is to prevent financial catastrophe. Why is there a pending catastrophe?</p>

  <p>"It is known that for a long time now preparations have been underway for a large
  injection of money into the country. This is being done through various means,
  including buying up 50- and 100-ruble bills. Banking organizations in our country and a
  number of private banks in Austria, Switzerland and Canada have become involved in
  this. ...</p>

  <p>"The financial war that has been declared on us is continuing. And `war is war.'...
  We know of an attempt to resell billions in Soviet money through the FRG to
  Switzerland, and through Hungary to Luxembourg, the Netherlands, etc."</p>

  <p>Then he is asked, "To what would such an action by Western banks lead?"</p>

  <p>Answer: "[It] would be tantamount to a financial catastrophe. ... We would have an
  artificially induced hyperinflation."</p>

  <p>Hyperinflation would bring about the financial catastrophe. Then "the advocates of
  rapid privatization would come to power. They would conduct privatization under
  conditions of mounting inflation and in such a way that our country would be auctioned
  off dirt-cheap. I will put it in even harsher terms. We would be threatened with a loss
  of economic independence, with a kind of `quiet,' bloodless annexation."</p>

  <p>Such is the situation. It could scarcely be put in clearer terms.</p>

  <h4>But what about the big banks?</h4>

  <p>By naming Switzerland, Luxembourg and even Canada, the prime minister avoids the
  real culprits, namely the U.S., British, French and Japanese banks, because without
  their approval these satellites of the great imperialist powers would not dare to
  embark on such a plan.</p>

  <p>We see then that this "financial war" is a concerted effort by the capitalist
  privateers working in conjunction with the big international banks to disrupt and
  disintegrate the country financially and, inevitably, economically as well.</p>

  <p>Thus far Pavlov has described the situation in realistic terms and has shown the
  connection between the international banks and the domestic counterrevolutionaries who
  are conspiring, as he puts it, to come to power by means of the rapid privatization of
  the means of production.</p>

  <p>What follows from these dire conclusions?</p>

  <p>"The first task of extraordinary importance is to prevent a slide toward
  catastrophe," Pavlov continues. Indeed it is. But how?</p>

  <p>"Unusual measures are needed for this," he says. "Today, we talk a great deal about
  a market. It must be understood that this is a means to an end, not an end in itself.
  We are certainly moving toward a market, and we will be taking some very decisive steps
  in this direction; otherwise there is no future for us.</p>

  <p>"But I emphasize that, in addition to a market, the country needs a program for
  accelerated modernization of industry. Our strategic goal is a highly efficient mixed
  economy. Here we are united both with our predecessors and with the most radical
  marketeers. The differences begin with the question of what should be mixed with what,
  and how. This is extremely important, because the mixing can be done in such a way that
  the economic foundation of our state is totally demolished."</p>

  <p>But a mixed economy is precisely what exists in the Soviet Union today! It has been
  the proclaimed aim of the Gorbachev administration since 1987. It has been developed
  and promoted by the administration of which Pavlov is now the prime minister, and it is
  undermining the socialist sector. His problem is how to arrest the further inroads of
  the capitalist market, which is causing chaos.</p>

  <p>Trud then asks, "So, is privatization necessary?" Pavlov answers, "Without
  question."</p>

  <p>So we are back to square one &mdash; privatization. But, says Pavlov, it should fill
  in the "niches and pores" while "skirting" heavy industry. Why introduce it in the
  pores and niches of society when it already exists on the broad avenues of Moscow and
  Leningrad! What's he talking about?</p>

  <h4>A convertible ruble</h4>

  <p>When it comes to the market, he says: "Now we are moving on to fundamentally
  different things, above all, to stabilization of the ruble at the earliest possible
  date. The government will make the ruble partially convertible (it will be possible to
  exchange it for foreign currency)."</p>

  <p>But he doesn't tell us how this will be done. To be convertible means being able to
  freely exchange it for the dollar, the pound, the yen or the deutschmark. Certainly
  this has been the objective of the Soviet government for a long time.</p>

  <p>Who has prevented it, making it so hazardous? The very banks he says are conspiring
  to bring economic catastrophe in the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>It is easy for the Soviet Union to make the ruble convertible either partially or
  completely. But that puts the ruble at the mercy of the foreign banks. Why? Because
  they can at any time on the basis of conspiracy create a run on the ruble and bring
  about the type of financial catastrophe he's talking about.</p>

  <p>A convertible ruble would be a theoretical possibility if there were in truth a free
  capitalist market and free capitalist currencies. But the reality is that the Western
  currencies are subject to control and manipulation by the big seven capitalist powers,
  who regularly meet in secret for this purpose. They publicize the meetings but never
  say what they discuss. But they regularly agree to lower or raise a particular
  currency.</p>

  <p>They attempt to rig their currencies because they are always in fear of a so-called
  free fall of any of the major currencies.</p>

  <p>To make the ruble even partially convertible at this time is to strengthen the hand
  of the imperialist banks against the USSR. Or should one take the word of the bankers
  that they will be nice to the Soviet Union?</p>

  <h4>A hard-pressed debtor</h4>

  <p>Finally, converting the ruble with the object of expanding trade strengthens and
  widens the capitalist market in the USSR and thereby strengthens the capitalist
  privateers. Even without the conversion of the ruble in part or whole, the USSR has
  embroiled itself with the international banks by means of loans it is hard-pressed to
  make prompt payments on. It has sought loans from some of the smaller capitalist
  countries like Spain and is now in the process of getting loans even from China.</p>

  <p>Before Gorbachev and his grouping took over, the Soviet Union was the most
  credit-worthy country in the world. Today its debt status is similar to some of the
  underdeveloped countries. How could all this happen when the USSR is also the
  second-largest gold producer in the world?</p>

  <p>While Pavlov is very firmly against private ownership of the basic means of
  production, he supports the significant concessions that have already allowed deep
  inroads into the socialist state structure. And he's for widening the capitalist
  market.</p>

  <h4>Changes in price structure</h4>

  <p>Pavlov supports, as does Gorbachev, the comprehensive change in the price structure
  that has just gone into effect.</p>

  <p>This is what agitates the masses most. They know that higher prices for basic items
  will inevitably become the means for expropriating the working class in favor of the
  bourgeoisie, despite promises that wages will be raised to compensate for higher
  prices.</p>

  <p>The price increases were originally conceived to mollify the bourgeois elements in
  Soviet society by means of a massive redistribution of the national income so as to
  favor the rich at the expense of the masses. Gorbachev is the architect of this, and
  began to agitate for it back in 1987. In many public speeches, he argued that the price
  of bread was so unrealistically low that children were using loaves of bread as
  footballs.</p>

  <p>Now the prices have been raised drastically on items of mass consumption which for
  years and years were regarded as stable.</p>

  <p>There may also be price increases on TVs and other goods considered luxury items,
  but this doesn't really bother the rich because they have lots of money. The burden
  falls on the masses and not on the well-to-do. Those who have hidden sources of money,
  all these hideous social strata who lead a parasitic existence &mdash; speculators,
  petty entrepreneurs, etc. &mdash; will gain as a result of the price increases.</p>

  <p>The price increases will hurt the masses the most because they have no other income.
  It's Robin Hood in reverse, taking from the poor to give to the rich. No wonder it
  caused apprehension from the beginning, as did the attacks on "levelers," that is,
  anyone wanting more equality, not less, in Soviet society.</p>

  <p>The irony is that while this price move is calculated to mollify the bourgeois
  elements, they just use it to inflame the masses against the Gorbachev administration
  &mdash; in the same way bourgeois politicians do in capitalist countries.</p>

  <p>Thus, the capitalist press takes delight in interviewing people waiting on long
  lines for basic foods.</p>

  <p>This is so reminiscent of the Polish experience of 1980, when the International
  Monetary Fund, which had gradually gained control of Poland's economic levers through
  its growing foreign debt, demanded broad increases in the price of food. The capitalist
  media then fanned the flames of outrage into a counterrevolutionary movement against
  the very government which had carried out its dictates.</p>

  <h4>Heavy industry and consumer goods</h4>

  <p>In the Trud interview, Prime Minister Pavlov gives the impression that he supports
  orthodox communist practice against the bourgeois elements, and is for raising
  productivity in heavy industry which will later spur the production of consumer items.
  But in reality his analysis is abstract, scholastic and shallow. He divorces economics
  from the actual political situation by defending theoretical propositions which the
  bourgeoisie doesn't really oppose &mdash; industrialization and the rationalization of
  industry. They're not opposed to heavy industry; they just want to take it over.</p>

  <p>Pavlov is closing his eyes to what is happening politically. The counterrevolution
  is utilizing all these developments, especially the price increases, to discredit the
  Gorbachev administration. That is what's behind the Moscow demonstrations.</p>

  <p>No economic measures that the Gorbachev government takes should disregard the
  existence of social classes and groupings in the USSR. The question is what to do
  politically with the bourgeoisie. It is becoming more arrogant, more impudent and is
  wrecking and sabotaging the socialist sector of the economy.</p>

  <p>The question is, what political measures is the government ready to take against the
  profits and social and political privileges of the bourgeoisie? The question is one of
  social inequality. But first, what measures must be taken politically against the
  bourgeois counterrevolution? Then the government must decide how to economically
  fortify the socialist sector.</p>
