  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Yeltsin's trip to Germany (Dec. 5, 1991)</title>
</head>

  <h1>Yeltsin's trip to Germany</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Dec. 5, 1991)</h5>

  <p>Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Republic and the chief
  counterrevolutionary figure in the Soviet Union, visited Germany on Nov. 22. The trip
  to the city of Cologne was for the purpose of negotiating with German big businessmen
  in an attempt to win investments and loans for the Russian Republic from the German
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin's visit has considerable importance for several reasons. He intended, of
  course, to orient the German bourgeoisie, and in particular the industrialists in the
  high-technology field, to conduct business with him as the head of Russia, the largest
  republic in the USSR.</p>

  <h4>A shift in relationships from Gorbachev to Yeltsin</h4>

  <p>This would mean that the economic and political relationship between Germany and
  Russia would inevitably supersede the federal relationship previously negotiated
  between Mikhail Gorbachev, the president of the USSR, and Helmet Kohl, the Prime
  Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). It would signify a profound shift in
  relationships.</p>

  <p>The FRG swallowed up the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which was facilitated by
  bourgeois/former Communist Party elements in the Hungarian government and the Gorbachev
  regime. After that, Gorbachev and Kohl engaged in extensive, comprehensive negotiations
  on the relationship between the FRG and the USSR.</p>

  <p>But this was all before the August coup in the Soviet Union. Yeltsin's challenge to
  the USSR as a unitary state and to Gorbachev as its head had not yet come out into the
  open.</p>

  <h4>New situation after coup attempt</h4>

  <p>After Aug. 19, however, under pressure of the counterrevolutionary elements,
  Gorbachev dissolved the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies. He then handed most of
  the power of the People's Deputies over to the various republics. This accelerated the
  process, which he had begun earlier, of dismembering the USSR. Soon it was on a
  run-away course.</p>

  <p>What has been happening in the USSR is not so much the devolution of power from the
  central government to the various republics, but the disintegration of the USSR as a
  whole. Presumably, this has redounded to the benefit of the Russian Republic and its
  inhabitants. But such an assertion is belied by the growing severity of the economic
  crisis and the disarray in Russia as well as the other republics, all caused by the
  attempt to overturn the socialized economy.</p>

  <p>There have been continual negotiations between the federal government and the
  republics over treaties of union and the like. To date, however, they have not stood
  the test of time.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, the USSR still exists as a "juridical entity," according to
  historian and deputy Roy Medvedev. But whether it exists de facto is another
  question.</p>

  <p>The counterrevolutionary elements are working hand in glove with allied imperialism
  &mdash; especially the U.S. &mdash; to dismember the USSR. Whether the existence of the
  USSR as a juridical entity still has considerable significance at this time depends on
  the outcome of the struggle between these elements and the broad mass of the working
  class,the latter are showing more readiness and willingness to combat the growing
  threat of full-scale bourgeois counterrevolution.</p>

  <p>Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former foreign policy adviser and national security chief
  during the Carter administration, has been campaigning for deepening the breakup of the
  USSR. He urges that less and less attention be paid to the Gorbachev regime. Bush and
  his advisers, however, are for holding on to Gorbachev while at the same time they
  continue to work on breaking up the USSR and are making separate economic and
  diplomatic agreements with the republics.</p>

  <h4>Will Germany deal with Yeltsin or Gorbachev?</h4>

  <p>The agreements between Kohl and Gorbachev were made before the August coup, after
  long and comprehensive discussions. Kohl, of course, also consulted with Yeltsin, but
  the agreements were consummated between the two heads of state, between the FRG and the
  USSR as it existed before the coup.</p>

  <p>Since then the situation has undergone a radical change. So the German bourgeoisie
  and government now find themselves on the horns of a dilemma over how to deal with
  Yeltsin.</p>

  <p>Certainly, those agreements which pertain to Eastern Europe and the liquidation of
  the GDR were specifically made with Gorbachev as head of the USSR. The German
  bourgeoisie's problem is that its deals with Yeltsin, even though undertaken by
  representatives of German big business and not necessarily the FRG as a state, imply a
  move toward recognition of the Russian government. By virtue of the size and importance
  of the Russian Republic, these deals could overshadow any agreements made with
  Gorbachev acting on behalf of the USSR.</p>

  <h4>Times have changed</h4>

  <p>Yeltsin's visit to Cologne comes at a time when the mood of the world bourgeoisie,
  particularly in Germany, differs fundamentally from when Gorbachev and Kohl were
  negotiating the treaties and agreements that were consummated more than a year ago. At
  that time, the liquidation of the GDR and the prospects for trade, investments and the
  penetration of imperialist capital into eastern Europe and the USSR had all generated a
  mood of euphoria in bourgeois circles.</p>

  <p>By contrast, Yeltsin's present visit to Germany comes at a time when the imperialist
  bourgeoisie everywhere, but particularly in Germany, are seized by a mood of profound
  pessimism. They are becoming all too aware of the problems attendant on the liquidation
  of the GDR and the prospects for trade, investment and the penetration of imperialist
  finance capital into the USSR.</p>

  <p>One of the purposes of Yeltsin's visit, of course, was to raise the spirits of the
  German bourgeoisie with tall promises of great opportunities for them in Russia.</p>

  <h4>Question of the ruble</h4>

  <p>First he went to great lengths to assure the German finance capitalists that he
  would work hard to make the ruble convertible (which he deems necessary to facilitate
  trade with the capitalist countries). He apparently doesn't remember, or maybe doesn't
  even know, that capitalist Germany was the USSR's principal trading partner in the
  capitalist world not long ago, when the USSR did not have a convertible ruble. That's
  because the USSR at that time, before the Gorbachev camarilla took over, was among the
  most credit-worthy governments in the world.</p>

  <p>The USSR then wasn't going hat in hand to the G-7 (the seven biggest imperialist
  countries) to beg for credits and loans. In fact, the imperialist banks were competing
  with each other to loan the USSR money because of its excellent credit standing and,
  more significantly, because its economy was thought to be stable, if not prosperous.
  Also, the USSR was the world's second-largest gold producer, and was ready to secure
  any loans with its huge gold reserves.</p>

  <p>What's the situation now? The German industrialists were not very impressed by
  Yeltsin's promises of a convertible ruble. He gave no timetable for the
  convertibility.</p>

  <p>They wanted to know how quickly he would effectuate the capitalist reforms in the
  Russian Republic, now that it was "completely sovereign" and could carry out an
  independent policy. For all his big promises, his answer was most revealing.</p>

  <h4>Yeltsin promises capitalism, but can't deliver</h4>

  <p>From the beginning of the Gorbachev administration, Yeltsin had been publicized in
  the Western capitalist press as the maverick who was for speeding up the capitalist
  reforms. His difficulties with Gorbachev arose precisely from their difference in pace
  in restoring capitalism in the USSR.</p>

  <p>Now he is at the head of the largest state of the USSR. He certainly must have
  complete authority to accelerate capitalist restoration, free from the restrictions and
  hindrances which plague the Gorbachev leadership.</p>

  <p>Wasn't Yeltsin in Cologne to assure the German bourgeoisie that now everything would
  go full-speed ahead?</p>

  <p>But the head of the bourgeois regime in Russia said that over the next three years
  "a third of the republic's large, state-owned enterprises would be converted to private
  ownership." (New York Times, Nov. 23)</p>

  <p>This must have astonished his big-business audience. Here was the great accelerator,
  the man who had constantly attacked Gorbachev for tardiness and vacillation in
  converting socialist state ownership into capitalist enterprises. And what does he
  promise? That over a three-year period only a third of the socialist-owned enterprises
  would be converted to private ownership.</p>

  <p>Now, that's taking a slow boat to China.</p>

  <p>What does it all demonstrate? Not the <strong>unwillingness</strong> of Yeltsin and
  his counterrevolutionary cohorts to subvert the socialized industries into capitalist
  enterprises, but their <strong>inability</strong> to do so. That's the crux of the
  matter.</p>

  <h4>Can't persuade the workers</h4>

  <p>It has now been six years since the Gorbachev administration attempted to introduce
  their well-publicized capitalist reforms. They have found insurmountable obstacles.
  Most important is their inability to persuade the masses to accept the well-known ills
  that go along with conversion to capitalism: unemployment, the lifting of price
  controls, inflation, and the general chaos that follows when the equilibrium
  established in socialist industry over decades of centralized planning is
  disturbed.</p>

  <p>The headline in the New York Times said, "Yeltsin leaves Germans dubious.
  Industrialists and politicians question commitment to the market economy." Yeltsin is
  committed to it, alright. But can he and his cohorts carry through the capitalist
  restoration? That's the question in the minds of the German industrialists he's trying
  to persuade.</p>

  <p>Horst Siebert, the head of the German World Economic Institute, commented on
  Yeltsin's speech: "The framework is not there yet." What he meant, of course, is that
  the <strong>capitalist</strong> framework is not there yet. He added that "capital will
  only begin to flow in there when a credible program is announced and placed in effect."
  That comes as a cold shower after the lofty promises made by Yeltsin.</p>

  <p>The German bourgeoisie, like that in the rest of the world, are no longer so
  enthusiastic about the prospects for the penetration of Soviet industries and their
  rapid conversion into thriving capitalist enterprises, where maximum superprofits would
  flow as easily as the water over Niagara Falls. On the contrary, what they know now is
  that large loans must first precede any outflow of maximum profits.</p>

  <p>The risks are all too great, and they are of an economic as well as political
  character. The USSR, it is true, is in a state of transition from a basically
  socialized economy into a capitalist system. However, the bourgeoisie dreams of rapid,
  fundamental change that would convert the USSR into a reservoir of superprofits, which
  would flow into the coffers of Western capitalist banks and treasuries, may turn out to
  be pure fantasy.</p>

  <p>What has happened in the USSR thus far is a counterrevolution in the political
  superstructure. There has been accompanying damage to the economic structure. The
  counterrevolution has not, however, been able to make the necessary and indispensable
  qualitative change in the economic structure of the USSR that would make it a viable
  area for capitalist superprofits.</p>

  <p>Certainly a great deal of damage has been inflicted on the economy of the USSR. But
  if the counterrevolutionaries have their way and proceed with their plans, the severity
  of the economic crisis can provoke a genuine proletarian resurgence of a type which
  would topple this narrow bourgeois current now at the helm of the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>The cool reception in Cologne to Yeltsin's lofty promises is shared by the world
  bourgeoisie. Their pessimism at the moment reflects not only their dim prospects for
  superprofits in the USSR, but the state of the capitalist economy in general. There are
  no longer any capitalist economists able to deny that a full-scale capitalist crisis is
  penetrating every nook and corner of their decadent social system.</p>

  <p>As for the U.S., all one has to do is pick up any capitalist newspaper and see the
  flow of data from the capitalist government itself. It verifies that what the masses
  are now enduring is not just a small-scale recession, but a full-scale and enduring
  capitalist crisis.</p>
