  <h1>After Shevardnadze, the rise of the neo-Bolsheviks</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Jan. 10, 1991)</h5>

  <p>December 31 &mdash; It is now 11 days since the sudden resignation of Eduard
  Shevardnadze, the foreign minister of the USSR. As is well known, his departure not
  only stunned the public in the USSR but was regarded as a momentous development
  throughout the world. It led many, many people to wonder what had caused this
  surprising development.</p>

  <p>In light of the precipitous decline in the world position of the USSR during
  Shevardnadze's tenure in office, one would think the very first thing on the agenda of
  the Congress of People's Deputies would be to call for a full and comprehensive
  investigation into the causes and consequences of his appointment as well as his
  departure.</p>

  <h4>Right of Congress to conduct investigation</h4>

  <p>In the last two years, the government of the Soviet Union has gone through a number
  of changes in form, making it more like a bourgeois government. The power of the
  executive has been strengthened at the expense of the Congress of Deputies, which has
  been remodeled to resemble a bourgeois parliament &mdash; that is, to be little more
  than a talk-shop.</p>

  <p>In the early days of the Russian Revolution, the Congress of Soviets, whose deputies
  were directly elected by the workers, soldiers and peasants and were subject to recall,
  combined both the legislative and the executive in one body. This form of workers'
  state first emerged in history during the 1870-71 Paris Commune.</p>

  <p>In a bourgeois democratic state, however, the powers are separated into the
  legislative, judicial and executive branches. What is significant in this form is not
  so much the diffusion of power but that both the executive and the judiciary are
  removed further from the masses than in a Paris Commune-type government.</p>

  <p>In the structure of the U.S. government, the judiciary are generally appointed for
  life, removable only for cause (which rarely happens). In the imperialist epoch,
  especially, power is concentrated more and more in the executive branch.</p>

  <p>Even in matters of war and peace, the legislative body in any capitalist country has
  little say. The parliament may occasionally complain, but most often becomes the
  cheerleader for imperialist adventures. For a parliamentary institution to stop a war
  is the rarest of political phenomena.</p>

  <p>But a bourgeois parliamentary body does have the right &mdash; and occasionally uses
  it &mdash; to inquire into the activities of the executive branch. Indeed, it has the
  power of subpoena. Under these circumstances, it would have been quite proper for the
  Congress of Deputies to immediately launch a public inquiry into the basis for
  Shevardnadze's resignation. The congress could have demanded an accounting by
  Shevardnadze of his tenure in office.</p>

  <h4>Renounced anti-imperialism, collaborated with bourgeois counterrevolution</h4>

  <p>Under his tenure, the USSR government renounced anti-imperialist support to
  oppressed countries. It encouraged if not assisted outright the hostile forces that
  overthrew the governments of the GDR, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, and
  conspired with bourgeois elements in the Hungarian government to open their borders,
  which ended in the swallowing up of the German Democratic Republic.</p>

  <p>There is so much that Shevardnadze, and Gorbachev too, of course, have to answer to
  in matters relating to foreign policy. They must explain why and how they developed a
  cozy friendship with U.S. Secretary of State Baker. What if any secret agreements were
  made with respect to the developing war crisis over Iraq? They must explain how it
  happened that Shevardnadze (presumably with Gorbachev's blessing) agreed to co-sponsor
  with the U.S. &mdash; the avowed enemy of all the oppressed people of the world &mdash;
  the resolution in the UN that gives the U.S. the green light to attack Iraq on Jan. 15
  if it does not unconditionally withdraw from Kuwait, a territory that Iraq has
  historical claims to.</p>

  <p>As a Cabinet member, Shevardnadze had immunity from prosecution. On resigning,
  however, he loses that immunity. He is therefore subject to a subpoena from the
  Congress of Deputies to testify in any investigation conducted by a committee of the
  Congress, or be subject to contempt proceedings. That's the way it's done in most
  bourgeois parliaments, for instance, in the U.S.</p>

  <p>He is also subject to possible criminal proceedings based on allegations made by the
  Minister of the Interior and also by the Defense Ministry, who have plainly stated that
  foreign intelligence agencies are at work in the USSR. The question is what
  Shevardnadze knows with respect to the operations of the CIA in the USSR.</p>

  <h4>USSR deputies get paid by U.S.</h4>

  <p>For instance, there was an article in the New York paper Newsday on Dec. 30 on how
  "the Soviet Defense Ministry, responding to a question from deputies about `anti-Soviet
  subversive activity,' submitted a report noting that the U.S. congressionally-funded
  National Endowment for Democracy had given grants to the Inter-Regional Group of
  deputies, which considers itself a radical opposition, and to a research center
  belonging to <em>Moscow News</em>, also a radical publication. The report, according to
  the independent Soviet news agency Interfax, added that Vitaly Korotich, editor of the
  liberal weekly <em>Ogonyok</em>, had been a researcher at Columbia University's Gannett
  Center for Media Studies."</p>

  <p>So, many of the people who are presented here as the new voices of freedom in the
  USSR, and who are often paraded on network TV as Soviet experts (as Korotich has done
  lately), really are paid agents of the U.S. government through the notorious National
  Endowment for Democracy!</p>

  <p>It should be noted here that the U.S. capitalist media have long been deliberately
  confusing the issues in the USSR by labeling those supporting the bourgeois reforms as
  "liberals" and even "radicals," while those opposed to the reforms from a socialist
  direction are called "conservatives," "reactionaries" and "right-wingers." Who can all
  this be aimed at except those here who think of themselves as liberal and would find it
  harder to defend the forces pushing for a return to capitalism if they were called by
  their right name?</p>

  <h4>Soyuz bloc attacks Gorbachev/shevardnadze policies</h4>

  <p>A large bloc opposed to capitalist market reforms has recently emerged in the
  Congress of Deputies. It is called Soyuz, and among its outspoken members is a young
  army colonel, Nikolai Petrushenko. According to the same Newsday article, Petrushenko
  "accused some of the political insurgents who favor free markets and an end of
  Communist rule of being agents of the CIA. He said he had learned in his political
  classes years ago of how the CIA would destroy the Soviet Union. `They said the
  Communist Party would be destroyed, the army would be undermined, there would be calls
  for private property and national rights,' he said. `All of it has come true. So why
  should we trust the United States?'"</p>

  <p>This is what many in the USSR must be asking themselves. How could a socialist
  country get into such a deep foreign policy alliance with the imperialist U.S.?</p>

  <p>And how did things get to the point where the Pentagon actually was able to reach
  out to the Soviet military, inveigling General Mikhail Moiseyev, the chief of staff of
  the USSR, to visit the U.S. in early October when they hoped to get him to give his
  blessings to the imperialist adventure in the Middle East and agree to cooperate
  militarily with the U.S. forces? Fortunately, General Moiseyev turned down the
  Pentagon.</p>

  <h4>Bourgeois reform on shaky ground</h4>

  <p>It should now be clear that Shevardnadze's resignation was not solely a foreign
  affairs matter. Nor was it due entirely to the imminence of a U.S.-engineered attack
  against Iraq.</p>

  <p>Shevardnadze's departure has deep roots in the soil of the Gorbachev
  administration's capitalist economic reforms. After more than five years of
  experimentation, these reforms have brought about the near collapse of the economic
  structure of the USSR. They have also brought in their wake social, political and
  ethnic consequences that threaten the breakup of the USSR altogether.</p>

  <p>It is not the socialist ownership of the means of production, the centralization of
  industry or the lack of a capitalist market that have brought the country to the abyss.
  It is the accumulation of anarchic, market-oriented, capitalist experimentation with
  the economy which is the real culprit for all the chaos in the USSR today.</p>

  <p>This is especially evident in privately conducted trade and commerce in the food
  distribution industry, and has brought about the familiar phenomena of capitalist
  speculation, hoarding, outright theft and embezzlement. These ugliest characteristics
  of capitalist society are now widespread in the USSR.</p>

  <h4>Emergence of `neo-Bolshevism'</h4>

  <p>After five years of capitalist experimentation and wearied waiting by the masses for
  the promised improvement in their material well-being, a revolutionary communist
  opposition to the bourgeois reforms is developing. This is revealed in the weekly
  <em>Moscow News</em>, which is these days an organ of the bourgeois critics of the
  Gorbachev administration.</p>

  <p><em>Moscow News</em> of Dec. 2-9 asks whether "neo-Bolshevism" is on the rise. It
  refers to the growth of many political organizations which go much further in attacking
  the capitalist restorationists than do the Communist deputies in the Soviet
  parliament.</p>

  <p>In fact, <em>Moscow News</em> notes a virtual "kaleidoscope of newly emerging
  parties and movements" and an "angry buzz from crowds rallying in city squares. What
  are they? Repercussions of the 70-year-long past [or] is it an emerging neo-Bolshevism
  which is dangerous if only because it has taken from its predecessor the idea of social
  equality which is particularly attractive during any crisis?"</p>

  <p>Social equality! At last <em>Moscow News</em>, which has been so vociferously
  pushing the bourgeois reforms and masking them as freedom and democracy, has finally
  come out and named what it fears most: a renaissance of revolutionary communism, the
  communism of Lenin, that is, of the early Bolshevik period.</p>

  <p>The issue is the struggle for social equality, not, of course, petty-bourgeois
  egalitarianism, but the social equality of which Marx spoke in the <em>Gotha
  Program</em> and which Lenin further developed in his <em>State and Revolution</em>. It
  is basically a struggle against the growth of privilege, the growing differentiation
  between rich and poor.</p>

  <p>So it is no wonder that <em>Moscow News</em> quotes a writer who says, "We face a
  paradox. An actual ban on the class approach and its false contrast with universal
  human values is happening at a time when social and economic differentiation is growing
  and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening ... [W]e are stubbornly being
  told there is a need for fraternization between the striking coal miners and the
  growing ranks of millionaires, a need to gloss over the enmity between the two, despite
  the fact that our entire historical experience is literally crying out about the
  inevitability of a conflict." The writer is Richard Kosolapov in <em>Moskovsky
  Stroitel,</em> #36, 1990.</p>

  <p>The same issue of <em>Moscow News</em> quoted from a leaflet addressed to workers
  and intellectuals, distributed by blacksmiths from a machine-building factory in
  Sverdlovsk. It reads in part: "The Soviets of all levels, the government and its
  economic advisors are now drumming it into our heads that the market is for the benefit
  of us all, making all kinds of promises about charitable meals, universal human values
  and so on, doing their best to exterminate our class consciousness. ... Do we really
  need such Soviets? What will they bring to our people, except poverty and
  animosity?"</p>

  <p>"Neo-Bolshevism," continues <em>Moscow News</em> in another article, "represented in
  this country by the United Working People's Front and similar organizations, is also
  dangerous because it strikes the right chords under the banner of communism, winning
  over a sizable section of the population. These are mostly those who fear the market.
  ... Another type of neo-Bolshevism is to be [found] in the Marxist Workers' Party
  &mdash; the Party of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, as well as in several
  socialist parties and movements <strong>within</strong> [our emphasis-SM] the Soviet
  Communist Party."</p>

  <p>The Communist Party as such is no longer the monolithic organization it once was.
  Now it contains a variety of different factions, from those that are extremely
  conciliatory if not totally obedient to the Gorbachev reformists, to a great many
  opposed to Gorbachev on the basis of revolutionary communist principles.</p>

  <p>The attacks that have been given most prominence, however, are those that emanate
  from Soyuz, the national association of people's deputies already referred to, which
  began last February. This group of deputies is bound together on the basis of averting
  the disintegrationist character of Gorbachev's nationality policy, which has led to
  ethnic strife and threatens the very existence of the central government.</p>

  <p>But some go much further and also oppose the capitalist market schemes of the
  current governing group.</p>

  <h4>A call for organized communist resistance</h4>

  <p>Look what happened when Veniamin Yarin, a Presidential Council member, made a speech
  to a Soyuz congress and accused the opposition of conducting a witchhunt against the
  free marketeers. Yarin was greeted with a virtual tempest of indignation. People's
  deputies shouted him down with cries of, "He wants to turn us capitalist!" (<em>Moscow
  News,</em> Dec. 16-23.)</p>

  <p>Yarin was roundly attacked by the chairperson of Moscow's United Workers' Front.
  This speaker, according to <em>Moscow News,</em> "called perestroika a premeditated
  counter-revolutionary coup and demanded Gorbachev's dismissal from all his current
  posts. He called for tough measures against the bourgeoisie and for the organization of
  a communist resistance movement throughout the country. The presidium doggedly reminded
  the speaker that his time was up. But the audience demanded that he continue."</p>

  <p>No longer can it be said that the only progressive opposition to the bourgeois
  reforms comes from the ranks of the Congress of Soviet Deputies. There is mass
  opposition that goes much, much further than the traditional "conservative" communist
  opposition in the congress. Whatever opposition exists in the congress is reflective of
  what is happening among the masses at large. And now we see it is beginning to take on
  a revolutionary communist character.</p>
