  <h1>Behind the U.S. rhetoric on Haiti</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Oct. 17, 1991)</h5>

  <p>Whatever the imperialists do in Haiti, they do for themselves. They do it to
  undermine, not to aid, the anti-imperialist struggle. Whenever they appear to do
  something progressive, it is either a sham or a concession wrested by the pressure of
  the masses.</p>

  <p>The diplomatic corps of U.S. imperialism seem to be up to their necks in complex
  maneuvers with the Organization of American States and other imperialist powers to
  support the restoration of Jean-Bertrand Aristide to his elected post as president of
  Haiti.</p>

  <p>All this has been accompanied by florid rhetoric about the need to broaden
  "democracy" in the Western Hemisphere. In Bush's words, this would be possible because,
  "with the exception of Cuba," democracies have been gaining full control of their
  destinies in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

  <h4>U.S. talk of supporting democracy</h4>

  <p>It was only a week ago, on Oct. 1, that Bernard Aronson, U.S. Assistant Secretary of
  State for Inter-American Affairs, said the elections that brought Aristide to power
  "were held under unprecedented international supervision. The OAS and the United
  Nations both oversaw them. Therefore, they have a legitimacy not just in Haiti but
  internationally. So it is very important, in our point of view, that they be defended.
  ... Every time democracy is threatened by the military of this hemisphere it sends off
  potential shockwaves and we want to make clear that this kind of behavior has a
  terrible price. We are going to isolate them, and we hope that the hemisphere is going
  to isolate them until democracy is restored."</p>

  <p>Why now the sudden shift in U.S. policy toward Haiti? The Bush administration is now
  concerned over Aristide's "human rights record." It has suddenly found out that
  Aristide was weak on defending the "human rights" of the Duvalierists. A great deal of
  prominence is being given to a move in the Haitian National Assembly to elect an
  interim president &mdash; not Aristide, of course, who was elected by the Haitian
  people last December with 68% of the votes.</p>

  <p>The change can be seen in this quote from the San Francisco Chronicle (Oct. 5):
  "Business leaders yesterday expressed fear that Aristide's return to power might mean
  the start of a bloodbath against the army and other groups, including better-off
  members of Haiti's bourgeoisie. Several businessmen referred to a speech Aristide made
  Sept. 27, in which he appeared to extol the recent practice by some of his supporters
  of using a tire necklace known as a `Pere Lebrun' to burn people alive."</p>

  <h4>Caught in contradictions</h4>

  <p>This shift in U.S. policy is reminiscent of what happened during the long years of
  the Vietnam War. The State Department and Pentagon occasionally drove the media up the
  wall with contradictions that forced the newspeople to lie and later have to retract
  their stories.</p>

  <p>The journalistic team of brothers Marvin and Bernard Kalb, who worked first for CBS
  and then for NBC, were quite prominent in exposing contradictory public statements of
  the State Department. Finally in 1984 the department coopted Bernard Kalb, making him
  their spokesperson.</p>

  <p>In October 1986, however, after a briefing by Kalb on the bombing of Libya, a high
  State Department official completely demolished what he had said, giving a totally
  different version of the same event. Kalb quit his job in protest. He must have
  expected his old colleagues in the media to loudly applaud this brave act in the
  interest of truth. Much to his surprise, the media gave it only one day's coverage.</p>

  <p>Thereafter, the State Department went back to its regular procedure. Whenever an
  important shift in policy was contemplated, they would call in the chief executives of
  the networks and the publishers of the print media for a long discussion. Then the
  journalistic corps would do their job in accordance with the bosses' instructions.</p>

  <p>That is how it is today. The media is an instrument of imperialist finance capital
  and must perform its duties accordingly.</p>

  <h4>Shift in tactics</h4>

  <p>It doesn't take a von Clausewitz to know that this current shift by the Bush
  administration toward the military coup in Haiti is a tactical one and does not involve
  a change in strategic objectives.</p>

  <p>Let us take the statement by the head of the military camarilla, Brigadier General
  Reynaud Cedras, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Haitian people. He is
  reported to have said: "Today the armed forces find themselves obligated to assume the
  heavy responsibility to keep the ship of state afloat.... After seven months of
  democratic experience, the country once again finds itself a prey to the horrors of
  uncertainty."</p>

  <p>In a formal sense, Cedras' statement seems to be in direct contradiction with the
  pronounced policy of the U.S. and the other Western imperialist powers &mdash; to
  support a democratic government in Haiti headed by its elected president, Aristide.
  Cedras appears as the avowed enemy of democracy while the imperialist powers are its
  fervent, unwavering supporters. But let us look a little closer.</p>

  <p>Cedras is not condemning democracy in general. He is condemning the proletarian
  democracy that the Haitian masses have been engaged in since Aristide's election last
  December.</p>

  <p>They have been taking destiny in their own hands. They were also practicing
  democracy when they meted out proletarian justice to their tormentors, their torturers,
  the murderous Tonton Macoutes.</p>

  <h4>Democracy of the masses</h4>

  <p>When proletarian democracy and proletarian justice begin to take hold, democracy
  becomes a danger to the imperialist bourgeoisie. Then it becomes clear they are just as
  concerned with getting rid of that democracy as Cedras is.</p>

  <p>Thus, the line of Cedras and that of the imperialist bourgeoisie are not at all
  antithetical, even though Cedras himself may be forced out of his military
  position.</p>

  <p>The loud chorus for democracy coming from the imperialist powers is not really in
  contradiction with what the general is saying so brutally and frankly. What the
  imperialists have in mind, as they have shown on so many occasions throughout their
  history, is to establish a pro-colonialist democracy, one run lock, stock and barrel by
  imperialist finance capital and carried out either by the compradore bourgeoisie
  through some sort of constitutional government or, more likely, by a military
  camarilla.</p>

  <p>The imperialist masters want to see the democratic facade function in an orderly
  manner, so that it sustains capitalist exploitation and imperialist oppression. When
  that fails, then the military, the trained cadres of imperialism, step in to establish
  "order."</p>

  <p>Any kind of democracy where the masses have a real say in running their own economic
  affairs is considered political interference in the affairs of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <h4>Drunk with democratic rhetoric</h4>

  <p>The Bush administration has drunk some very heady wine while pledging its
  partnership, so-called, with the Gorbachev bourgeois restorationists and the new East
  European governments. It spoke about democracy in such lyrical terms that usually
  skeptical progressive people were beginning to take the demagogy for good coin. Even
  some of their own administrators have gotten carried away with it.</p>

  <p>At first, this "democracy" demagogy with which the U.S. cloaked its
  counterrevolutionary role in Eastern Europe seemed so appropriate for Haiti. Didn't it
  prove that Bush's New World Order meant opposing military dictatorship and allowing the
  people uninhibited rights to organize, freedom of the press, freedom to criticize? But
  all this turned out to be mere froth.</p>

  <p>What changed everything was the turn of events among the Haitian masses themselves.
  They have directed their wrath not only against the military and the paramilitary
  Macoutes but also against the compliant bourgeoisie in Haiti, against the merchants and
  the entrepreneurs who, while often speaking out loudly against the military and also
  bemoaning the ever-present hand of foreign finance capital &mdash; U.S. and French as
  well as others &mdash; will always prefer them to the rule of the masses.</p>

  <p>So now there has been a swift change in tone by the Bush administration. They
  realize that, even with the masses being subdued by naked terror, a full-scale
  revolutionary convulsion has been provoked by the coup, a virtual second phase of the
  Haitian Revolution that began with the overthrow of Duvalier.</p>

  <p>While the U.S. and its collaborators may have thought they could ingratiate
  themselves with the masses by intervening under the cover of restoring Aristide, they
  now realize they can't fool the people that way. Nor can they change the collective
  mind of the masses by cooking up a deal whereby Aristide is permitted back under
  conditions that would make him a mere front for imperialist intrigue and brutal
  military rule.</p>

  <p>U.S. imperialism has hopelessly discredited itself with the masses. Only the Haitian
  bourgeoisie are willing to compromise with imperialism, but they fear for their necks.
  That's how vigorous the revolution is. It's a genuine attempt at a social revolution,
  not just a change in the political scenery. The realization of this has caused the
  abrupt about-face in the tactical approach by the State Department.</p>

  <h4>What is the state?</h4>

  <p>An understanding of the situation in Haiti requires a clear Marxist understanding of
  the nature of the bourgeois state. We must look at the relationship between the form
  and essence of the state.</p>

  <p>The state is not just a collection of political and social institutions. It is not
  just the National Assembly, important as that may seem at some periods. In times of
  acute crisis the parliament is revealed as nothing but a talking machine. Nor is the
  judiciary in any better shape. This is so clearly illustrated in Haiti today.</p>

  <p>Who rules in Haiti? The state &mdash; that is, the military. As Friedrich Engels
  long ago explained in his monumental work, "The Origin of the Family, Private Property
  and the State," the state when stripped down to its skeletal essence is the bodies of
  armed men. All else is subordinate.</p>

  <p>Without the bodies of armed men and women, no state, whether bourgeois or
  proletarian, can long exist as long as there are still class antagonisms that rend
  society apart. The state is an instrument of class domination. In times of acute
  crisis, when one class challenges another, this domination can only be exercised by the
  armed terror of the state.</p>

  <p>What is Aristide's biggest sin, according to the bourgeoisie? He realized the
  importance of establishing the embryo of another state, a state based upon the poor and
  the oppressed. Suddenly all the bourgeois papers have pointed to 300 palace guards
  trained by the Swiss as the beginning of an independent paramilitary force, appointed
  outside the commanding staff of the armed forces, which could become the possible basis
  for a people's army.</p>

  <p>For a while the imperialist bourgeoisie winked at this development as nothing more
  than a palace guard. But the sudden rising of the masses has made the imperialist
  bourgeoisie more circumspect. They are now putting a spotlight on some of the changes
  that Aristide made earlier: the retirement of several officers out of line and the
  promotion of others; the failure to submit the names of new officers to the National
  Assembly, where they might not have been confirmed; and stirring insubordination by
  championing the rights of the poorer rank-and-file soldiers.</p>

  <p>Kwame Nkrumah, the leader of Ghana's struggle for independence, also attempted to
  set up an independent force and appealed to the rank-and-file soldiers. But the
  British-trained officer corps eventually overthrew him.</p>

  <p>Aristide's attempt to reshuffle the military staff in and of itself did not arouse
  the State Department or the Pentagon. Suddenly, however, all this has become important.
  It is because it hints at the development of a workers' militia, the only true
  alternative to the military camarilla trained, fed, clothed and housed by the
  imperialist bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>A workers' militia is the only answer to the vicious terror squads, to the trained
  thugs nurtured, cultivated and trained by the U.S. But it also must be armed and
  trained.</p>

  <h4>Lessons of revolutionary history</h4>

  <p>In the final analysis, to overthrow the yoke of imperialist domination one must
  learn from the models of victorious revolutions like in China, Cuba and Vietnam. Of
  course, a social revolution and the withdrawal of U.S. imperialism through peaceful
  means is more desirable. But where has that ever happened? Where has true independence
  been achieved that way?</p>

  <p>The military establishment of the bourgeoisie in a colonial country cannot be
  dissolved by edict. History shows that Marx was right. The old machinery of state
  cannot be taken over, let alone permit itself to be dissolved. It must be broken, and
  it can only be broken by the self-effort of the masses themselves in shaping their own
  state.</p>

  <p>The body of armed men and women in modern times can only be dissolved when class
  antagonisms have been dissolved. Only then will there be peace and no necessity for
  coercion, repression, or domination of one group of the population against another. And
  class antagonisms will disappear only when social equality has been attained.</p>

  <p>That may be a considerable distance in the future, but there is no other road, as
  history has shown.</p>
