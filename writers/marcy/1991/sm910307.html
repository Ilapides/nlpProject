  <h1>The Gulf War in historical perspective</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 7, 1991)</h5>

  <p>We suppose a good argument could have been made for the view that Spartacus, the
  leader of the famous slave insurrection in ancient times, should not have attempted to
  march on Rome in his struggle to liberate the legions of slaves under Roman
  subjugation.</p>

  <p>Yet Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, the stalwart leaders of the revolutionary
  communists in Germany at the time of the First World War, thought so well of him that
  they named their party the Spartacus League.</p>

  <p>Perhaps many of the generals and advisers in Spartacus's army thought it wasn't wise
  to attempt to go to Rome. But those differences of opinion were within the camp of the
  rebellious slaves themselves. They should be sharply demarcated from the arguments and
  debates in the Roman senate concerning Spartacus, who was as much demonized, hated and
  vilified in his time as Saddam Hussein is today.</p>

  <p>Spartacus fought a war of liberation against slavery. In the Roman senate, composed
  exclusively of landlords and slave owners, he was accused of atrocities. But all modern
  historians now agree that the atrocities were committed by the Roman legions against
  the slave army. In fact, nearly a century before Jesus was supposed to have been
  crucified, the Roman legions nailed 1,000 rebel slaves to posts, one each mile on the
  long road from Cairo to Damascus.</p>

  <h4>John Brown, Nat Turner &mdash; Were they wrong?</h4>

  <p>We can argue strategy and tactics, we can ask ourselves whether the tactic of John
  Brown was correct, storming Harper's Ferry with a handful of people. We can ask if Nat
  Turner should have relied upon a conspiracy (which lasted an astonishingly long time
  before it was discovered by the slave owners).</p>

  <p>There were many after the defeat of the Paris Commune in 1871 who said that the
  uprising only led to the massacre of tens of thousands of Communards. But Karl Marx
  drew the correct lesson from it &mdash; that it was an electrifying preview of how the
  proletariat was capable of rising up, overthrowing the old state apparatus and
  establishing its own state on new class lines.</p>

  <p>Georgi Plekhanov, after the defeat of the 1905 Revolution in Russia, said that the
  workers should not have taken up arms in the first place. Lenin, in answer to
  Plekhanov, found most relevant Marx's analysis of the Commune. A defeat after having
  fought out a struggle to the end, he said, is preferable to a rotten compromise or a
  surrender which results in the demoralization of the working class.</p>

  <p>Marxists in any age would do best not to bemoan such defeats but learn the relevant
  lessons. Marxists, instead of cursing the temporary darkness, instead must light even
  one small candle to illuminate the path ahead.</p>

  <h4>We won't forget the imperialists' crimes</h4>

  <p>What do we say to those in the imperialist camp now giddy with success?</p>

  <p>That we know how you vilify leaders of the oppressed and glorify your puppets. We
  remember how, back in 1960, the UN was a screen behind which Patrice Lumumba, the first
  president of the newly independent Congo, was murdered in very similar circumstances to
  today. We know how you tried to raise to heroic stature your puppets &mdash; Tshombe,
  Kasavubu and Mobutu. This will be remembered by the revolutionaries who overturn the
  Zaire regime.</p>

  <p>We know how you plotted the overthrow of Salvador Allende. We know the circumstances
  of his murder. We know you glorified the butcher Pinochet and his fascist dictatorship.
  Even now, you still have a soft heart for him as head of the military forces in a
  democratic Chilean regime entirely suitable to your tastes and wants.</p>

  <p>We know how you rated Malcolm X as a leader and the circumstances under which you
  undid him. We're not impressed by your efforts to coopt Martin Luther King while
  unleashing a war of drugs and police brutality against the oppressed communities.</p>

  <p>It is sad, of course, to see that so many progressives, including much of the
  working class at the moment, have been taken in by the vilification of Saddam Hussein.
  How neatly the imperialist bourgeoisie is covering up its robbery of the fabulous
  wealth in the Arabian peninsula!</p>

  <p>Of course, we should not expect the capitalist press to do less than its chauvinist
  worst at a time when it is engaged in a supreme effort to promote a most predatory war.
  Nor should we expect that august, most deliberative parliamentary body, the U.S.
  Senate, to be more objective than the landlords and slave owners of the Roman senate.
  The U.S. senators are far more wealthy; 96 of the 100 are white men, most of them
  millionaires. Even the Roman senate had some plebeians in it. Here we have
  totalitarianism in its most shameful aspect.</p>

  <h4>Bush wants total victory</h4>

  <p>What is the real issue in this war? Newsweek dated March 4 put it frankly and
  brutally: "Bush's battle plan target: total victory," they exulted.</p>

  <p>This has been the aim from the very beginning, to take total possession of the
  peninsula. Kuwait was the pretext, but the target was Iraq. Now the imperialists are
  boasting about it as France, Britain and the U.S. are in the process of invading deep
  into Iraq itself, which they had promised not to do! They have gone far beyond the 12
  resolutions they themselves imposed upon the UN Security Council.</p>

  <p>But what have UN Security Council resolutions meant in all the years of its
  existence? Can anyone name a significant, independent step which resolved a military
  struggle?</p>

  <p>The UN has been the setting for a collective conspiracy of all the imperialists. For
  a period of time, the three permanent imperialist members on the UN Security Council
  &mdash; the U.S., Britain and France &mdash; skillfully maneuvered to get the entire
  council's blessings, roping in a number of subordinate capitalist powers, dependent
  states and outright puppet regimes &mdash; and of course the USSR and China.</p>

  <p>What has made this war possible in the first place? It is the "new world order"
  which Gorbachev and the Bush administration palmed off on the world scene as early as
  December 1988, when Gorbachev came to the UN and spoke about a new age of "universal
  human values." Now we see what that means.</p>

  <p>Could any of this have happened if the Soviet Union and China, or even just one of
  them, had vetoed the original resolution putting an embargo on Iraq?</p>

  <p>Can governments which call themselves nonaligned or independent, and in truth are
  oppressed by imperialism, ally themselves with the imperialists against another
  oppressed country under the false insignia of a "war of liberation"?</p>

  <p>How did they all get themselves inveigled by such a monstrous falsehood in the first
  place? How could the U.S. become the leader of such an important bloc as to get
  unanimous resolutions passed in the Security Council, especially after Panama and
  Grenada? After Chile, Nicaragua, the Philippines, the hypocritical position on South
  Africa &mdash; the list could go on and on.</p>

  <h4>Britain and Kuwait's `independence'</h4>

  <p>And let's not forget Britain. Who made Kuwait "independent"? Who carved it out of
  the territorial area of what had always been ancient Iraq, going back to the days of
  Mesopotamia? And didn't the Soviet Union itself oppose admitting Kuwait to the UN in
  1962 on the ground that it was impossible to call it an independent nation for while
  the British Army had finally left Kuwait, it retained all the strings of
  domination?</p>

  <p>But Kuwait was admitted anyway. Yet China at that time was not! Even though the
  Chinese government represented the most populous country on earth, and the people had
  liberated themselves from feudalism and foreign capitalism in one of the most profound
  revolutions in contemporary history, it was not allowed in the UN. Instead the Chiang
  Kai-shek counter-revolutionary forces in the pay of U.S. imperialism, which had been
  driven off the mainland by the Red Army, occupied China's seat on the Security Council
  and in the General Assembly.</p>

  <p>Once Kuwait was admitted to the UN, its false stance as an independent nation gained
  currency in the rest of the world. It didn't matter to the oil companies that it played
  the role of an independent country and joined the nonaligned movement. The fabulous
  wealth they were extracting was all that counted.</p>

  <p>What accounts for the euphoria of the imperialists now? The U.S. is in control of
  all the oil in Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. Bush proclaims the rule
  of law as the guiding line in this genocidal assault. But possession is nine-tenths of
  the law. That's the sine qua non of imperialist politics.</p>

  <p>There is the usual bickering in the UN Security Council, which is holding
  closed-door sessions. But this doesn't disturb the Pentagon one iota. The banks, the
  military-industrial complex and the Pentagon now hold the prize possession in their own
  hands.</p>

  <h4>Citicorp squeezes Saudi Arabia</h4>

  <p>What about the "victors" in the Middle East, like Saudi Arabia? They are now, in the
  name of Prince Al-Waleed, shelling out their cash, or what is left of it, to Citicorp
  under the shameless cover of becoming a principal stockholder of this giant
  international bank (Wall St. Journal, Feb. 25). But in truth they are handing over $590
  million to strengthen the crumbling reserves of this giant financial behemoth.</p>

  <p>So even before the military victory is completed, Saudi Arabia has gone to the
  financial markets to borrow money. It used to be a lender.(New York Times, Feb. 25).
  How could such a transformation take place in such a record time? The answer lies in
  the legions of the allied military forces, most of all the U.S., who go in as
  "liberators" and will remain as occupiers.</p>

  <p>How interesting that a New York Times piece (Feb. 22) tries to pass off the prince
  as a self-made man! He earned a billion all by himself. The prince is one of 20,000
  royal family members and 4,000 princes and princesses. This is the remains of an
  ancient tribe now turned into a decadent bourgeois cabal at the beck and call of its
  imperialist master.</p>

  <p>Now that Kuwait has been liberated, you would expect a rush of international
  construction companies vying to repair the damage, contracts which could last for
  years. But if you don't see a rush, and only some polite bidding, be aware that all of
  this was figured out in advance between the U.S., the British and the French. We wonder
  what share the junior partners who didn't contribute militarily, Japan and Germany,
  will get out of the deal.</p>

  <p>Reparations is the name given to this form of banditry. It hasn't been decided who
  the nominal paymaster will be, but we know in advance who pays the paymaster.</p>

  <p>One would think that the mere possession of all the fabulous wealth now in the hands
  of the imperialists would solve the inexorable crisis of the system of exploitation and
  oppression which has provoked this conflict in the first place. Yet the irony is that
  not all the underground oceans of wealth in all of Arabia can solve the fundamental
  problem of the capitalist system.</p>

  <p>Why is that?</p>

  <p>Scarcity was the curse of all previous social systems. It was scarcity that caused
  endless rebellions of peasants and changes of political regimes.</p>

  <p>But it is <strong>super-abundance</strong> which is the Achilles heel of the
  capitalist system.</p>

  <p>Just look at the gyrations of the stock markets in New York, Tokyo, Paris, London,
  Frankfurt. What do they show?</p>

  <p>They fear the end of the war. The glut of oil which has been slightly alleviated by
  the war will become even worse and will speed on the economic crisis, which no amount
  of financial trickery and no amount of military prowess can long stave off. Military
  expenditures are like a narcotic which at first provides a temporary stimulus, but when
  given in large, continuous doses turns into a depressant. This is precisely what is
  unfolding before the eyes of the whole world.</p>
