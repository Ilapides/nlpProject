  <h1>The world situation and prospects for resurgence</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Oct. 10, 1991)</h5>

  <p><em>Following are excerpts from Workers World Party Chairperson Sam Marcy's talk at
  a special conference on the theme of "In Defense of Socialism" held in New York City
  Sept. 28.</em></p>

  <p>We called this conference because of an emergency in the world situation.</p>

  <p>The world situation is obscured and falsified by the capitalist press, even more
  than in the past. If it were only a question of exposing them in a literary way, there
  wouldn't be such a great hurry. That's fine for an organization that analyzes and
  observes events only.</p>

  <p>But we are the political party of the emerging revolutionary working class
  organization. We are not just observers and analysts. We are not just an organization
  that attempts to educate ourselves, period. We are a participant in the struggle.</p>

  <p>We're not sitting on some high mountain watching which way the struggle goes. In
  this world struggle between the oppressors and the oppressed, where reaction is now
  aided by the forces of counterrevolution in the Soviet Union and elsewhere, we have to
  be more than ever a partisan in the struggle, on the revolutionary side of the class
  barricades. We have to utilize everything possible, from literature to sticks and
  stones, to beat back the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <h4>Struggle in Tadzhikistan</h4>

  <p>Millions of workers here are for the first time hearing about a country called
  Tadzhikistan, one of the 15 republics in the Soviet Union. They will find that (to our
  great surprise and happiness) in Tadzhikistan the reactionary rule of the imperialist
  bourgeois stooges has been overthrown and they have reinstalled their old
  government.</p>

  <p>This is a very, very important event. But the ink is hardly dry and the capitalist
  press is already writing about how this government will be overthrown, how masses are
  gathered in the streets.</p>

  <p>Let us get a few facts straight. It's not such a small country. It's rather big
  geographically. And it has five to six million people. That's larger than about 20 or
  30 countries in the United Nations. It is, according to the Constitution of the USSR, a
  free republic with equal rights with all other republics.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev and Yeltsin, you just said the other day that all the republics are equal.
  You just signed a treaty to give the republics more rights, so there wouldn't be any
  interference from the central government. Aren't these your own words?</p>

  <p>You and your collaborators will grant equal rights to all republics and defend them
  against incursions from others &mdash; that's what you dished up just two weeks ago,
  although it's been in the constitution for many, many years.</p>

  <p>In Tadzhikistan they elected a parliament said by all to be representative of the
  people. We're not even going into the question of whether it was bourgeois parliament
  in composition or whether it was worker and peasant. But it was a representative
  parliamentary institution.</p>

  <p>And what happened to that republic? You Yeltsins, Gorbachevs and Yakovlevs, you
  managed to create a reign of terror so that the parliament got shook up temporarily,
  the president turned tail and became your tool. The parliament seemed docile and
  obedient to what looked like an overpowering, omnipotent grouping, newly established in
  the USSR.</p>

  <p>Well, they thought for a while. They saw that Yeltsin and Gorbachev were not so
  strong. Those in the parliament could get together again and say, "We're not going to
  be bulldozed by the forces of political reaction and capitalist reform. We are going to
  reconstitute ourselves and put back the president we elected. We are going back to what
  we were before you panicked the whole population, tried to subdue them, disorient the,
  create confusion and an ideological and political terror."</p>

  <h4>Lenin statues put back</h4>

  <p>So what happened? They go together, they got their parliament back again, and they
  reestablished working class law and order. They put back the statues of Lenin.</p>

  <p>That's strong symbolism. All those who are only too happy to see the symbols of
  revolutionary Marxism brought down now see some are being restored. Only the czarist
  riffraff could confuse Lenin with any type of unjustified terror. He's the symbol of
  the revolution, and restoring that symbol speaks volumes. Not all the bourgeois
  professors on the face of the earth can obscure that singularly significant fact of the
  parliament restoring the symbol of world socialist revolution.</p>

  <p>We ask these "democrats," the exponents of imperialist democracy and their stooges
  in the Kremlin, are you going to allow this parliament to stay in power? Are you going
  to allow them to be equal, like you said, without interference from the center?</p>

  <p>You're the ones who talk about how the center only orders and commands, that you
  want to abolish all that and give the republics freedom. Well okay. Here is this one
  republic which has gotten real freedom. Are you going to let it alone? That's the
  question. Or are you going to organize counterrevolutionary mobs?</p>

  <p>Are you going to get together the so-called gilded youth, like during the French
  Revolution, the counterrevolutionaries, bring them from Moscow by plane and by train?
  Are you going to get your friends and collaborators in Pakistan or even Saudi
  Arabia?</p>

  <p>Are you going to say that this is really a religious war between the Muslims and a
  secular power? In that whole country, everyone has been Muslims for centuries. What
  kind of nonsense are you raising, saying that outside of parliament there are Muslims
  and inside there are not?</p>

  <p>This struggle raises a very important question, because if one republic can restore
  its sovereignty, then all the other republics can do so. And we look forward to that
  prospect!</p>

  <p>We look toward the regeneration of the Soviet Union, not to the downfall of
  communism, which is a lie. It's only a phase in the class struggle. It took one small
  republic to remind us how fraudulent are the capitalist doomsayers who have written off
  the whole epoch of socialist revolutions, who say that the free enterprise system is on
  the rise.</p>

  <p>The U.S. has authority over the grouping in power in the Soviet Union today. Are
  they going to try to snuff out the rebellion in Tadzhikistan and say this is the end of
  the revolutionary struggle?</p>

  <p>Tadzhikistan is only one event that requires our closest scrutiny and support. The
  issue here is not our ideological solidarity with them on all fundamental issues. The
  issue is whether the Gorbachev-Yeltsin camarilla that is now in authority will allow it
  to exist without using unconstitutional means, mob violence of a fascist type to
  overthrow it.</p>

  <h4>Romanian miners</h4>

  <p>But let us go to another very current event which gives us heart and which the
  previous speakers went over &mdash; the miners' strike in Romania. That is a reversal
  of the capitalist reforms, a singular event that shows there are forces moving to
  overturn what was imposed on the Romanian people.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Gorbachev regime got together with its imperialist allies, one of the
  first victims was the Romanian regime. How terribly it has vilified, how little true
  information has come out. Let us ask ourselves the question, what started off the
  counterrevolution in Romania? It did not start as a mass movement.</p>

  <p>What happened was a bloody coup d'etat carried out by the military, which overthrew
  the duly elected leaders of the party and the government.</p>

  <p>It was a conspiracy between Gorbachev and the imperialists to overturn the
  government by force and violence, and execute the leadership. They started a reign of
  terror and an ideological and political campaign that confused the masses.</p>

  <p>When the coup d'etat took place, the U.S., its Western supporters and its friends in
  the USSR saw that they could not get a full cabinet of the bourgeoisie to take over.
  They couldn't get enough from the old counterrevolutionary elements in Romania to take
  the helm of government. They couldn't even hold all the old generals in line to support
  a thoroughgoing counterrevolutionary government.</p>

  <h4>Council of National Salvation</h4>

  <p>They decided they'd have a Council of National Salvation, get those Communist
  leaders who were scared to death and who quickly capitulated. All throughout Eastern
  Europe, hundreds of thousands of Communist officials have panicked and surrendered what
  they presumably stood for.</p>

  <p>But that was not enough for the imperialists. They wanted a complete overturn. They
  couldn't get it because they are nowhere near having a majority of the people. They had
  to turn to Communist renegades to participate in a government that they knew in advance
  would be a servant of the imperialists.</p>

  <p>You know, over the years we agreed with hardly any of the strategic approaches of
  the Romanian leadership on international questions. We didn't agree with their
  ideology, their tactics or their course of conduct, which we've always doubted and
  criticized as leading in the direction of the bourgeoisie. But it was a shocking thing
  to see the execution of the authentic leadership of the Romanian government.</p>

  <p>It was a situation where the class enemy takes the initiative and by the use of
  terror finds that the party is unprepared, is disarmed, not so much militarily as
  politically.</p>

  <p>This lesson about Romania applies to all of Eastern Europe. the imperialist
  bourgeoisie and its stooges can't run the governments without former Communists and
  without the support of workers who still believe in socialism and communism.</p>

  <p>For more than a year and a half now, the Romanian bourgeois elements, their
  supporters in the USSR and the imperialist governments have attempted to hurriedly
  introduce the capitalist system, not in slow stages over many years, but all at
  once.</p>

  <p>By hurrying it, they have brought the country down to a starvation level. What else
  could bring out thousands of miners twice in a row? What could do that except economic
  catastrophe?</p>

  <p>The imperialist bourgeoisie have installed a group of stooges who cannot stand on
  their own feet and are begging old-line Communist officials to come in and help them.
  They should not do it. They should not help them in any way.</p>

  <p>Any former Communist in the government of National Salvation should resign, get out
  of it. It is a trap. It is a phony setup by the imperialists. The miners have shown
  this. And for the first time the city of Bucharest, which seemed to be the scene of
  counterrevolution, joined the miners. The capital and the provinces seem to be together
  on this.</p>

  <p>The economic crisis has brought it out sooner than we expected. The workers are
  aware that this government is no good for them. As you see, the miners and the other
  workers forced them to resign. And that is a sign of acute political crisis, of a
  prerevolutionary crisis.</p>

  <p>Is there a leadership capable of dealing with the situation? A lot of leaders know
  that this capitalist government cannot run the country. It can't stabilize the economic
  situation. But are there enough working class forces who understand the situation and
  who are courageous enough to say that we'll take a chance and run it ourselves?</p>

  <p>There isn't as yet a revolutionary leadership that can disengage itself from the
  counterrevolution and form an alliance with those political elements of the Communist
  Party who are not besmirched by having taken office, who have not been waving the
  counterrevolutionary flag of the old Iron Guard, monarchist regime.</p>

  <p>There are many communist intellectuals in Romania. They have written a lot.
  Intellectuals in a revolution are necessary, as Mao Zedong once explained. You can't
  have a revolution without them.</p>

  <p>But what are the intellectuals doing there now? They're sitting on the fence. They
  have seen the workers' rebellion, they have seen that the fascist element is small,
  that the army is in reality divided if not neutral, and the police are scared. But are
  they bold enough to say to the Salvation Government, "Now you get the hell out of the
  offices before we drag you out," and set up a working class regime? That's what's
  needed.</p>

  <p>The intellectuals are the first ones to look abroad. They're the first to see what's
  doing on the international arena. They're looking westward, and also east to
  Moscow.</p>

  <p>They're scared to take power because they overrate the imperialist bourgeoisie. They
  overrate their finances. It was intellectuals who thought the capitalist market would
  bring relief to the country. It was they who read capitalist literature, they who knew
  the foreign languages best.</p>

  <p>Now their historic opportunity has come. The workers have shown they're not
  backward, they're moving forward, they've come as close to taking power as they can.
  But they haven't got the implements of statecraft, they haven't got the education
  necessary for administering a workers' state. Now is the time for the revolutionary
  elements in the intellectual petty bourgeoisie to step in.</p>

  <p>The opportunity is there. Are they going to let it slip by? The situation is clearly
  one that is pregnant with a revolutionary seizure of power. But those internationalist
  minded in the bourgeois, pro-imperialist sense are scared of outside intervention.</p>

  <p>If we want to understand the miners' strike and what is happening there we must
  understand the relationship of classes, the working class on the one hand, the petty
  bourgeoisie in the middle, and then the fascist, bourgeois elements, who are a narrow
  grouping.</p>

  <h4>History of Romanian CP</h4>

  <p>Now, a few facts about the Romanian leadership, the old communists. Romania always
  had a very strong and very devoted communist movement, but it was small. On the other
  hand, there was always a very strong right-wing, monarchist leadership of the
  bourgeoisie. The monarchy itself was collapsing and needed extra- military forces to
  suppress the revolution.</p>

  <p>The principal communist leaders spent almost all their lives in jail. Their first
  National Committee meeting was held in jail. The Iron Guard, the pro-fascist element
  similar to the Nazis, organized a raid on the prison and shot down many communist
  political prisoners. That gives you an idea who the Iron Guard is and how communists
  were treated under the old regime. That's the old Romanian democracy that the U.S.
  supported and is still for today.</p>

  <p>They're the ones who can organize a military coup and shoot down the authentic
  leaders in a counterrevolutionary coup d'etat.</p>

  <p>But the bourgeoisie can't rely on these fascist elements to run the government.
  Their very faces remind the older generation of the pre-war fascist terror against
  workers and peasants.</p>

  <p>The group of miners who came into the heart of Bucharest with sticks, without guns,
  didn't just have a grievance over their pay. It wasn't just to solve an economic
  problem.</p>

  <p>Their struggle takes on the political character of overturning the bourgeois regime.
  If that is done, the struggle for Eastern Europe starts all over again, between
  imperialism on the one hand this time the socialist revolutionaries, the workers
  themselves, on the other. And it will be heard in the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>Our purpose is to show the possibility of regeneration, that all is not lost, that
  the struggle is beginning. In all Eastern Europe the capitalist reforms are
  disillusioning the masses but the leadership, such as it was, has been inadequate even
  to return the situation to what it was before the collapse.</p>

  <h4>Rebellion in Zaire</h4>

  <p>It would be utterly impossible to have called this conference to discuss the most
  current events without taking into account an event on the African continent which
  could have global significance. There's Tadzhikistan, there's Romania, and now comes a
  much clearer, much more understandable example of resurgence, of rebirth &mdash; the
  struggle in Zaire.</p>

  <p>The Mobutu regime is the last holdover from the original Tshombe- Kasavubu-Mobutu
  grouping, stooges of the Belgian-French-U.S. imperialist bourgeoisie that crushed the
  revolutionary struggle of Lumumba. It seems like many, many years ago, but the struggle
  is new and young, as young as Lumumba himself and the delegation that came with him to
  the UN and wasn't allowed to land over here. Now, how do you like that for
  democracy!</p>

  <p>In the last day or two we've seen an anti-imperialist type of insurrection, not
  ideologically but in fact. We've seen a rebellion of the military rank and file that
  from the point of view of narrow economic interest would be taken as just a struggle in
  the military over not being paid. The army is supposed to brutally suppress the masses.
  Paying the army is usually the first thing a puppet government would do.</p>

  <p>Zaire has the richest sort of natural resources, particularly valuable for the new
  industrialization in the world. The imperialists keep tight control over a small clique
  of compradore bourgeois elements that rule as a result of having the military on their
  side and having the imperialist monopolies run the roost as though it were nothing more
  than a plantation.</p>

  <p>The Belgian government had been one of the most ruthless in the suppression of the
  Congolese people. They practiced virtual extermination up to the early 20th century, no
  less than what the conquistadors did in Peru. They reduced the country to semi-
  slavery, and yet Belgium is one of the most culturally advanced capitalist countries in
  the world. Their advancement is due to the sweat and blood of the Congolese people.</p>

  <p>When the revolutionary struggle started in 1960, it seemed like a new dawn was
  coming for all of Africa. The new young leadership of Lumumba answered the demands of
  the people to free themselves from imperialist slavery. But Lumumba was cut down by
  imperialist intrigue. Eventually their stooges Tshombe and Kasavubu were discredited.
  And Mobutu was put in as the successor to the Tshombe-Kasavubu regime.</p>

  <h4>Why regime lasted so long</h4>

  <p>Why has the Mobutu regime lasted so many years in the face of such horrible
  imposition of imperialist slavery? Why has there been no general uprising of the type
  we have seen elsewhere in Asia and Latin America, or in Angola and Mozambique?</p>

  <p>In Angola, there was the Portuguese dictatorship of Salazar. It's true it was helped
  to some extent by the U.S., but the Portuguese Revolution made it easier for Angola and
  Mozambique to free themselves. The imperialist bourgeoisie was narrowly concerned and
  could afford, from their viewpoint, a semi-independent government in the former
  colonies of Portugal. They hoped, as later events showed, to return them to imperialist
  domination.</p>

  <p>But with Zaire it's different. There isn't just one imperialist state that's
  interested in Zaire. It's not only France, not only Belgium, it's not even only the
  United States. It's all the imperialist powers of Europe and the U.S. That's how
  strategic that country is from the point of view of the struggle for profits. And it is
  a significant reason for the delay in revolutionary organization or the emergence of a
  leadership to challenge the colonialist, imperialist power.</p>

  <p>However, it has finally come to the point where Mobutu will be overthrown along with
  his supporters.</p>

  <p>It is difficult for a leadership to grow up under these conditions. Revolutionary
  leaders in Zaire have to think twice before they undertake an insurrection.</p>

  <p>And also I should say this. The socialist countries have made it their business for
  some years now not to provoke the Mobutu regime. They have not informed the people in
  the Soviet Union, China and elsewhere in the way required in the struggle against
  imperialism, even if that is only of a propagandist character.</p>

  <p>So the struggle in Zaire has been isolated, but the revolutionary momentum will
  break through this isolation, get rid of the puppet government and create a truly
  independent anti-imperialist state. Long live revolutionary Zaire!</p>

  <h4>Defense of Cuba</h4>

  <p>The anti-imperialist struggle that we carry on in the United States is so important.
  We must give every ounce of energy to be part and parcel of the anti-imperialist and
  proletarian class struggle throughout the world. We cannot have a truly socialist
  organization unless it is thoroughly anti-imperialist, unless it has an
  internationalist perspective, unless it sees itself as part and parcel of the same
  class, bound together by the same common oppression.</p>

  <p>It's more difficult than years ago. Today the United Nations is more thoroughly
  controlled by the imperialist powers than ever.</p>

  <p>But the main difficulty is the collapse of the USSR as a workers' state. While much
  remains that is enormous from the point of view of the revolutionary struggle, from the
  point of view of its ability to recuperate, it is nevertheless an obstacle at the
  present time. This has shown itself in an area of the deepest concern to us, the case
  of Cuba.</p>

  <p>We can't call our party together and confine ourselves to just one aspect of the
  revolutionary class struggle. Imperialism is a world system and it oppresses the
  overwhelming majority of the human race.</p>

  <p>Our problem is always can we carry on a domestic struggle, be with the workers on a
  daily basis, fight against national oppression in this country first and foremost
  &mdash; can we do this yet give most prominence to the type of struggle which will
  ultimately decide the fate and destiny of the movement here for years and years to
  come?</p>

  <p>What am I talking about? I'm referring to the danger that is facing Cuba. What is
  the U.S. preparing? What is it in effect doing at this very moment?</p>

  <p>No less than the former president of the United States, Ronald Reagan, and the son
  of President George Bush have gotten together with others and formed a corporation to
  sell bonds. It expects resources of $15 billion or more. And what is its objective? To
  put on the market some new invention? To advance medical research, astronomy or
  biotechnology? What is so important that it must have the name of an ex-president and
  by extension the name of a president?</p>

  <p>It's a corporation to sell off everything of value in Cuba. How could such a
  dastardly, impudent, criminal act be countenanced against a sovereign nation that has
  existed independently for over 30 years.</p>

  <p>They even had the gall to publicize it on Radio Marti, the voice of the Pentagon and
  the billionaires, in order to frighten and intimidate the Cuban people, to tell them
  that all they have built up in 30 years of life and struggle is already being sold off.
  Projects that are the pride of the Cuban people, advances in science and in particular
  medicine, agricultural projects, everything. Saying to them, it doesn't belong to the
  Cuban government anymore, it belongs to the investors, to those who are buying bonds
  now and are getting ready to come in to Cuba as soon as the U.S. invades.</p>

  <p>That is their prospect. Now, to underline that this is their aim, and to make sure
  that this message is meant for real, President George Bush went out of his way in his
  speech to the UN to insolently vilify the Premier of Cuba, the great revolutionary
  hero, calling him "a little dictator whose time has come."</p>

  <p>He wasn't referring to Mobutu in Zaire. He was referring to Fidel Castro, the most
  heroic figure in Cuban history, if not in all Latin America. It's preparation for an
  invasion, either through an attempt at some sort of coup if they can possibly engineer
  it, which we strongly doubt, or through infiltration, through the continuation of
  sabotage by the embargo, or through other means available to a military colossus only
  90 miles away.</p>

  <p>We have to take this very, very seriously. It can happen and it will put our
  movement to the test and put the party to the test. That's one of the reasons we called
  this conference hastily, because of the threatening situation. You know, you can say we
  will fight in El Salvador, we'll fight for the independence of Puerto Rico, we'll fight
  for freedom from the tutelage of the U.S. in Guatemala. But if Cuba goes down, it will
  set us back all the way.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie is trying to get us to accept the fact, to ideologically condition
  us so as to create a passive attitude in the movement and in the people. They want the
  movement to think that Cuba has already been taken over by the U.S. and the only thing
  that remains is how to parcel out the property of the Cuban people. They're attempting
  to create a psychological atmosphere that the act is already done and only a few
  ceremonial things remain. We have to fight this attitude.</p>

  <p>It was a treacherous act when the new military camarilla in the Soviet Union told
  the imperialist bourgeoisie that from here on it is stopping all support of Cuba and
  that moreover it is withdrawing a military detachment there.</p>

  <p>This was the most devastating and ignominious act because first of all it was
  supposed to be a secret thing. Defending Cuba was one of the rare progressive and
  revolutionary things done during the Krushchev period. When the agreement was made in
  1962 to remove the missiles, the USSR did leave a military detachment there, which is
  like putting up a signpost that the Soviet Union is with Cuba, notwithstanding the fact
  that the missiles have been removed. To acknowledge it so brazenly and say they will
  remove it is an invitation to U.S. imperialism to invade. It's why Bush can talk so
  pejoratively about Fidel Castro.</p>

  <p>It is this eventuality that occasions us to give our greatest attention to the
  defense of Cuba. We must not let an invasion happen.</p>
