  <h1>The twofold character of the world struggle</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Dec. 19, 1991)</h5>

  <p>Whenever and wherever the imperialist bourgeoisie gets into a profound economic and
  political crisis, it inevitably seeks in the most desperate ways to divert its crisis
  into anti-working class channels.</p>

  <p>Understanding this should be ABC for class-conscious workers, in particular for
  Marxists who have studied the historical evolution of the capitalist class.</p>

  <p>The present crisis raging throughout the U.S. is slowly but surely taking on a
  worldwide character and will become more onerous with each passing day. No amount of
  gimmicks by the Bush administration and their hordes of economic and political advisers
  will arrest it.</p>

  <p>At the present time, the U.S. ruling class is most anxious, above everything else,
  to utilize the crisis in the USSR to cover up its own, most formidable and insuperable
  problems.</p>

  <p>This should not prevent us from making an independent class analysis of the crisis
  in the USSR. Failure to do so would be playing into the hands of the imperialist
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <h4>Magnitude of the crisis</h4>

  <p>There can be no denying the magnitude of the crisis in the USSR. The collapse of the
  workers' movement there, the continuing breakup of the Union of Soviet Socialist
  Republics, the banning of the Communist Party, and the virtual disintegration of the
  party apparatus are the result of an adventurous attempt to restore capitalism.</p>

  <p>It began with what appeared to be an effort to revolutionize the scientific,
  technical and industrial apparatus of the USSR, which was a welcome forward step.</p>

  <p>However, the Gorbachev administration soon revealed what was really in store. To
  what extent it was premeditated or planned is not clear, but eventually it could be
  seen that perestroika entailed a fundamental change of social relations, indeed, of
  property relations. Nevertheless, it took the world communist movement by surprise,
  even after the imperialist bourgeoisie had unloosed a flood of favorable publicity,
  bordering on the most nauseating flattery, about Gorbachev and his numerous meetings
  with the imperialist leaders.</p>

  <p>The present crisis in the USSR is the result of six years of maneuvering to overturn
  the socialized economic system and bring about a so-called free capitalist market, with
  all that entails.</p>

  <p>In order to take a world view of the situation of the working class, the oppressed
  and the socialist movement, it is indispensable to analyze the crisis in the USSR in
  the light of the general crisis of capitalism. Furthermore, no analysis can leave out
  the unending attempts of imperialism to subvert the first successful proletarian
  revolution in world history by blockade, military pressure and political isolation over
  a period of more than 70 years.</p>

  <h4>Twofold character of world crisis</h4>

  <p>The present world crisis has a twofold character. While the crisis in the USSR
  cannot be separated from the world capitalist crisis, neither can the developing world
  economic and political crisis be divorced from developments in the USSR, Eastern Europe
  and the countries resisting imperialism like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
  and, closer to home, Cuba.</p>

  <p>It is best to begin an analysis of the twofold character of the world crisis by
  examining how the imperialist bourgeoisie presents the very latest developments in the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>In bold headlines, the New York Times of Dec. 9 reports on its front page,
  "Declaring Death Of Soviet Union, Russia And Two Republics Form New Commonwealth." The
  secondary head says: "Take Over A-Arms." And then: "Newborn Bureaucracy Inheriting
  Functions Of Old Authority." Virtually every word is slanted in an attempt to direct
  the reader into anti- socialist and pro-imperialist conceptions.</p>

  <p>It is true, of course, that Russia, the Ukraine and Byelorussia on Dec. 8 formed a
  so-called commonwealth of independent states. But left out is what a working class
  paper would have emphasized first and foremost: this commonwealth is a <strong>racist
  alliance</strong> by the three Slavic republics directed against the southern
  republics. Moreover, inside these three republics there are considerable non-Slavic
  national minorities. The national minorities, most of them historically Moslem, were
  brutally oppressed by Great Russian chauvinism during the czarist empire.</p>

  <p>This move is an attempt to recreate the old czarist, autocratic yoke on the ruins of
  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It is led by the notorious
  counterrevolutionary, Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Republic, and includes the renegade
  CP leadership in the Ukraine. Also joining in is the leadership of Byelorussia, whether
  willingly or not we cannot say at this time.</p>

  <p>Such a lengthy article as the one in the Times should have made clear at the very
  beginning that even the biggest of the southern republics, Kazakhstan, was excluded
  from attending the secret meeting which cooked up this scheme. Now that the deal is
  done, however, all the republics are invited to rubber-stamp this racist alliance, to
  in effect subordinate themselves to the domination of Great Russian chauvinism (with
  the Ukraine as a junior partner).</p>

  <p>Even more indicative of the racist character of this so- called commonwealth is that
  the Armenian bourgeois leaders have aligned themselves with it, for no other reason
  than that they are raising the banner of Christianity in opposition to the other
  southern states, which are mostly Moslem.</p>

  <p>What we see here is a virtual endorsement of the proposal put forth by the notorious
  czarist counterrevolutionary, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who offered a very similar
  solution in a letter to the Politburo during the Brezhnev period. He has long stood for
  going back to a Christian Russia dominated by the Slavs at the expense of the southern
  and Asian oppressed peoples.</p>

  <h4>Question of self-determination</h4>

  <p>The dismemberment of the Soviet Union and the setting up of this new so-called
  commonwealth is explained in the bourgeois media as a manifestation of
  self-determination. This is the type of self-determination that the Southern slavocracy
  in the U.S. invoked to break up the Union and perpetuate slavery. It was all done in
  the name of states' rights and self-determination.</p>

  <p>Rather than admit that the bourgeois economic reforms have pitted the different
  nationalities against each other, the new ruling group claim that severe national
  antagonisms "naturally" existed and have only come to the surface now because
  previously the various republics were afraid to rebel.</p>

  <p>Beginning with the 1903 conference of the Russian Social Democratic Party, the right
  of self-determination up to and including secession was a cardinal aim of the
  Bolsheviks. It was assiduously and energetically promoted by Lenin and was incorporated
  into the Constitution of the USSR in 1922. Each succeeding constitution after that, up
  to and including the one promulgated by Gorbachev and his colleagues, included this
  right.</p>

  <p>The right of secession of any state was never denied. It might be true that some
  wanted to break away but were fearful that exercising this right could lead to the type
  of repression which prevailed under the Stalin regime. Nevertheless, history shows that
  had there been a strong and formidable desire for independence, it could not have been
  long suppressed by fear or intimidation. We have seen so many national insurrections
  for independence throughout the world that continue to fight on despite oppression. For
  example, one of the oldest continues to rage in Ireland, no matter how severe the
  repression.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev unleashed centrifugal forces</h4>

  <p>The centrifugal forces now tearing the USSR apart were set in motion by none other
  than Gorbachev himself. They burst on the scene in December 1986 with a rebellion in
  Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan. Gorbachev had tried to drown out opposition to his economic
  reforms by replacing the Kazakh leader of the party in that republic, Dinmukhamed
  Kunayev, with a Russian, Gennadi Kolbin. There followed demonstrations and street
  battles eventually involving an estimated 200,000 people.</p>

  <p>In the "Communist Manifesto," Marx and Engels described how the bourgeoisie can set
  in motion forces that it then cannot control, "like the sorcerer who is no longer able
  to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells." This is
  what has happened to Gorbachev. With his bourgeois reforms, he set in motion
  centrifugal forces which are now consuming him.</p>

  <p>What a terrible retreat from the internationalist positions of Leninism!</p>

  <p>The Soviet press is now openly speculating on Gorbachev's resignation. It is
  interesting to note that he has denounced this so-called commonwealth as illegal,
  pointing out that the Congress of People's Deputies would have to approve it. But who
  destroyed the effectiveness of the Congress of People's Deputies?</p>

  <p>It was Gorbachev who pushed through in a way reminiscent of bourgeois dictators a
  resolution that deprived this same Congress of its real power. He in fact dissolved it
  and handed it over to the republics. They in turn are squabbling among themselves while
  the ground underneath all of them is trembling.</p>

  <h4>New economic pact</h4>

  <p>The economic pact among the three leaders, arrived at in secret, gives their scheme
  away. The very first sentence after the preamble states, "The parties have agreed to
  the following: To carry out coordinated radical economic reforms aimed at creating
  feasible market mechanisms, transformation of property and ensuring the freedom of
  entrepreneurship." What more need be said?</p>

  <p>"Radical economic reforms" is a phrase used over and over again by the Yeltsin-type
  counterrevolutionaries to mean deep-going, pro-capitalist reforms to restore
  capitalism. "Feasible market mechanisms" means to abolish price controls on every-day
  commodities and consumer goods of every type, including bread.</p>

  <p>The "transformation of property" means the abolition of socialized property and its
  replacement by individual ownership. This is well understood to mean the privatization
  of state-owned enterprises. "Ensuring the freedom of entrepreneurship" means to abolish
  the restrictions on the activities of a considerable petty bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>The latter have become so vociferous since the failure of the August coup that they
  have actually been attacking the Yeltsin government for not moving fast enough to give
  them the full freedom which this trio of renegades is now promising.</p>

  <h4>Call for a `Russian Reagan'</h4>

  <p>To get the full measure of where things are at, we refer the reader to an article
  that appeared Oct. 9 in Izvestia, and is translated and excerpted in the Current Digest
  of the Soviet Press (Vol. XLIII, No. 41). Written by Prof. V. Danilenko, it is deeply
  critical of the "democrats" like Yeltsin who came out on top in what the author refers
  to as "the August revolution." His criticism is that these politicians are not acting
  sufficiently in the interests of the entrepreneurs who helped them get in power.</p>

  <p>"We very much need a Russian Reagan," writes Danilenko. "A person who is capable of
  putting the main emphasis on the interest of private entrepreneurs.... And the
  government itself should be organized on market principles, providing broad legal
  opportunities for business to influence the processes of decision-making. ..."</p>

  <p>"A very distinct sphere of activity &mdash; political business &mdash; has existed
  in the West for a long time," explains Danilenko. "... Thanks to it, effective
  interaction between business and the authorities is ensured, and the actions of power
  structures are geared toward the requirements of entrepreneurs."</p>

  <p>He concludes that "Ties between business and political parties are necessary. ...
  Appropriate legal regulation of election campaigns that would officially allow business
  to exert an influence on voting results is necessary. ... Finally, detailed legal
  regulation of lobbying activity is necessary. This is the most effective instrument
  linking business to the power structures. We used to actively criticize this
  institution. Today we should admit that in any civilized country, lawmaking work is
  simply inconceivable without it."</p>

  <p>What a blunt exposition of the workings of capitalist democracy! Danilenko hasn't
  learned the art of deceiving the masses of the people that is practiced so
  professionally by Reagan and the others in the West he admires so.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois professor is speaking for the restless entrepreneurs, who he says
  provided "material assistance" to Yeltsin during the August days, if they weren't
  actually at the "White House" in Moscow directing opposition to the attempted coup. And
  now they're protesting that the Yeltsenites are not doing enough for them.</p>

  <h4>A new ruling class?</h4>

  <p>Are the new entrepreneurs a full-fledged bourgeoisie? They are certainly very
  formidable and were made doubly arrogant by the failure of the coup and the resulting
  sharp turn toward counterrevolution. But is this bourgeoisie the new ruling class?</p>

  <p>No. It is a nascent bourgeois stratum. This is a commercial bourgeoisie of big
  merchants, petty traders, thieves, small commercial bankers and small proprietors. They
  hide behind various organizational structures that call themselves collectives but in
  reality are dens of thieves appropriating the products of the labor of the workers.</p>

  <p>However, they still lack the fundamental attribute of a ruling class: <strong>they
  do not own the basic means of production.</strong></p>

  <p>Their struggle with the counterrevolutionary political leadership rotates around the
  mechanisms by which the basic means of production will become privatized. But this
  privatization has not yet taken place on a scale sufficient to satisfy either the
  imperialist bankers abroad or the nascent bourgeoisie at home.</p>

  <p>Even Yeltsin, when he went to Germany recently to assure the imperialist bankers,
  said that only a third of the basic means of production will be privatized over the
  next three years. That's a pretty long time, especially coming from this vociferous
  accelerator of radical reform.</p>

  <p>However, let us not underestimate the formidable character of the bourgeois
  elements. They are strong. They control many key political positions. Besides Yeltsin
  and others on a republic level, Gavriil Popov and Anatoli Sobchak, the mayors of Moscow
  and Leningrad, respectively, are in their camp.</p>

  <h4>Yazov's testimony</h4>

  <p>Furthermore, they are being boosted and trained by the imperialists, whose
  intervention must never be forgotten even for a moment. When Defense Minister General
  Dmitri Yazov, a member of the State Committee for the State of Emergency that organized
  the attempted coup, was interrogated a few days later, he is reported to have told the
  investigator:</p>

  <p>"We all agreed that in recent years Gorbachev had been traveling abroad frequently,
  and we often had no idea what important matters he was discussing over there. For
  example, what kind of report did Gorbachev deliver at the meeting of the Group of Seven
  in London? We didn't know very much about what he said there. Before this, at least we
  had always discussed everything in the Politburo or in the Presidential Council. Or in
  the Security Council. ...</p>

  <p>"We, of course, were unwilling to become even more dependent on the U.S. &mdash;
  politically, economically, and militarily."</p>

  <p>(As though to confirm what Yazov was saying about the influence of the imperialists
  in the USSR, this was published in Izvestia on Oct. 10 as a reprint from material that
  first appeared in the German magazine Der Spiegel on Oct. 7. Izvestia complained that
  it had to retranslate the material back into Russian because it didn't have access to
  the transcripts obtained by the German paper!)</p>

  <p>Yazov's testimony throws a powerful searchlight on the real causes of the coup
  &mdash; fear of becoming an appendage to U.S. imperialism. Unfortunately, this group
  was unable to take the masses into their confidence, call on them to carry out an open
  struggle against capitalist restoration and resign their posts if necessary to
  facilitate such a course.</p>

  <p>The coup was carried out not in the spirit of Leninist strategy and tactics but of
  crude Blanquism, at best. It was devoid of an ounce of Leninist teaching and experience
  on the three great Russian revolutions, beginning in 1905.</p>

  <p>It must be said in praise of Blanqui that he was a meticulous organizer. He
  demonstrated skill and ability in preparing the most minute details of conspiratorial
  work. Here, on the contrary, it is painfully obvious there was a lack of
  preparation.</p>

  <p>How much stronger the opposition to capitalist restructuring would have been had
  they begun the struggle much earlier, before Gorbachev and those to the right of him
  had the chance to pack the party leadership with bourgeois reformers. One milestone in
  the offensive of the neobourgeoisie was the 19th Party Conference of June-July 1988,
  which was hailed in the West and given enormous media attention.</p>

  <p>The conference, under the slogans of democratization and a struggle against
  bureaucratic command structures, was a fraud. It is so easy to see that now. It was not
  really intended to democratize the organs of socialist administration but to break them
  up and construct a bureaucratic administrative command structure suitable for
  capitalist restoration. This is precisely what Yeltsin is now doing.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin now has a parliament that is merely an instrument for him and his
  co-conspirators to issue one illegal decree after another, break up socialist
  organizations, and even ban the Communist Party &mdash; a neofascist act. Yet with all
  this, the bourgeoisie whom he represents are not satisfied. But when are the
  bourgeoisie ever satisfied with their servants?</p>

  <p>The 19th Party Conference, while spouting democratic phrases, in reality was an
  attempt to undermine the socialized economy and destroy the party apparatus. (We have
  never been uncritical defenders of the political apparatus of the CPSU and its
  positions. But to hail its destruction in the interests of pro-capitalist restoration
  is another matter.)</p>

  <p>We should remember that Yeltsin as late as 1988 was an alternate on the Politburo
  and first secretary of the Moscow committee, where he cultivated a bourgeois grouping
  around him. As Gorbachev finally explained rather apologetically to the conference in
  his summary speech (July 1, 1988), Yeltsin had changed the personnel of the Moscow
  party leadership "two or three times" before "this began to worry us." He changed the
  personnel of the party two or three times and only then did they begin to worry! This
  is utterly incredible.</p>

  <p>"I reproved Comrade Yeltsin at a meeting of the Politburo. I told Boris
  Nikolayevitch in a comradely way that he should draw a conclusion for himself and take
  this into consideration in his work. In other words, this was assistance to him and
  nothing more than that."</p>

  <p>Earlier in his speech, Gorbachev accused Yeltsin of resorting to "a peremptory tone
  and command methods. This was followed by endless change of personnel."</p>

  <p>The political differences, instead of being brought out openly and clearly, were
  masked by organizational maneuvers. While these were of course understood by the higher
  echelons of the party leadership, the political issues were not brought out so the
  masses could understand what was going on.</p>

  <p>It's not unusual for political struggles to be masked by organizational maneuvers in
  order to conceal class and group interests. But this party conference took the cake.
  The mask was glasnost, "democracy," which in practice meant democracy for the bourgeois
  elements to the exclusion of progressive and revolutionary criticism.</p>

  <h4>When economics yields to politics</h4>

  <p>Speaking in terms of universal modes of production, such as slavery, feudalism and
  capitalism, the economic structure always determines the political structure. But it is
  also true that once a nascent ruling class seizes the political structure at an
  opportune moment, it will ultimately turn the economic situation around to bring it
  into line with the political leadership. This can take decades or, as the struggle
  between feudalism and capitalism showed, even centuries.</p>

  <p>At the present time, the bourgeoisie in the USSR is formidable and has through its
  agents seized the political superstructure, particularly in the great centers like
  Moscow and Leningrad. However, its specific weight in the class structure of the USSR
  is still inadequate to constitute itself as a full-fledged ruling class. Furthermore,
  its so-called democratic representatives are in an extremely unstable position and may
  fall at any time, either as the result of a fascist coup, toward which some of the
  so-called democratic forces are already leaning, or because of a general upsurge by the
  Soviet working class, which is inherently the most formidable and numerous class,
  especially if we count the rural proletariat and the workers engaged in the
  agricultural collectives.</p>

  <p>This is precisely what the imperialist bourgeoisie is frightened about, and it is
  this perspective that revolutionary workers throughout the world should bear foremost
  in their minds.</p>
