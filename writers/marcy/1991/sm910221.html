  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Inter-imperialist rivalries and the role of the

  <h1>Inter-imperialist rivalries and the role of the masses</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Feb. 21, 1991)</h5>

  <p>On Feb. 12 President Bush met with defense ministers Tom King of Britain and Pierre
  Joxe of France. He had earlier met with the Israeli defense minister, Moshe Arens.</p>

  <p>These three are considered the principal allies of the U.S. in its coalition for the
  war in the Gulf. However, while both Germany and Japan are also considered principal
  allies, they were not invited to attend this conference. The meeting was for the
  purpose of expressing agreement on the need to continue the massive, truly murderous
  air offensive against the Iraqi people.</p>

  <p>On the same day, the allied imperialists fired tons of explosives from land, sea and
  air units against the concentrations of Iraqi infantry, armor and artillery in southern
  Kuwait. The attack was described by the allied military spokespeople as the largest
  combined operation of the Gulf War.</p>

  <h4>Where was allied imperialist solidarity?</h4>

  <p>Surely such an important military effort, considered a prelude to a later ground
  war, might have been seen as the time to also call in the German and Japanese defense
  ministers, in order to strengthen allied imperialist solidarity. But this was not
  done.</p>

  <p>Each of the two had previously pledged money as well as materiel to the imperialist
  venture and the rape of the Arabian peninsula. It is reported that out of $50 billion
  pledged by Washington's allies, Japan has promised $10.7 billion and Germany $6.6
  billion. (Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have each pledged $16 billion &mdash; showing who
  really controls their purse strings.)</p>

  <p>It should be noted that considerable hostility has been displayed by the U.S.
  against the Japanese imperialists for their meager contribution. The British
  imperialists have been even more vocal in their attacks against West German
  imperialism, charging a lack of interest in properly supporting the anti-Iraq
  crusade.</p>

  <h4>Role of Germany and France</h4>

  <p>Is it really true that both German and French imperialism are laggards in
  participating in the collective effort by the imperialists to redivide the Arabian
  peninsula?</p>

  <p>What is the real nature of their relationship to the U.S., and what is their role in
  the current redivision of the world? Rarely mentioned in the course of the controversy
  over what role each plays is the fact that neither of them has any oil resources within
  their geographical boundaries. They are non-oil countries, unlike the U.S. and Britain.
  (France has historically had connections with oil-producing countries in northern
  Africa, specifically Libya and its former colony in Algeria. This explains the war over
  Chad to a large extent.)</p>

  <p>Both Germany and Japan, by way of defending themselves against U.S. and British
  accusations that they should show greater cooperation by giving bigger contributions to
  the Gulf War, point to the treaties signed at the end of World War II. As former
  belligerents and principal members of the fascist Axis powers, they are
  constitutionally prohibited from rearming except in defense.</p>

  <p>Of course, in the case of capitalist Germany this is a ridiculously patent
  falsehood. As a member of NATO, it has been virtually occupied by U.S. and British
  troops and its military machine has been modernized with a view toward being a
  belligerent against the USSR.</p>

  <p>Japan has argued that it is constitutionally impossible for it to maintain an army
  except for self-defense, but has nevertheless continued to slowly rearm with the
  blessings of Washington over a period of time.</p>

  <p>But is this the whole truth? Is it true that Japanese and German imperialism are
  really opposed to making large military contributions in personnel as well as materiel?
  Not at all. Whoever takes these arguments at face value misunderstands even the most
  elementary basis for the participation, certainly the cooperation, of these two
  imperialist powers in the war against Iraq.</p>

  <p>One must look beyond the diplomatic rationale for this and come to the real issue
  &mdash; the one that determines their participation in the imperialist alliance in the
  first place.</p>

  <h4>Who gets the booty?</h4>

  <p>One must look to the material interest which concerns both Germany and Japan, for it
  is the same interest which concerns the imperialists as a whole. They want to know what
  share of the booty will be parceled out to each of the principal imperialist allies.
  What morsels will be thrown to the secondary line of bourgeois participants against the
  oppressed people of the Middle East? What bribes will be given to the officialdom of
  the client states, the puppet regimes of imperialism?</p>

  <p>In this connection, it should be mentioned that King Hussein of Jordan, in his
  speech on Feb. 7, was the first government official to mention the secret Sykes-Picot
  Treaty of 1916, in which France and Britain in the middle of World War I tried to
  divide the whole area of the Middle East to suit their needs. The intervention of the
  U.S. a year later changed the character of the proposed redivision.</p>

  <p>None of the capitalist media here have mentioned the relevance of this secret treaty
  to the present redivision. <em>Workers World</em> has been the only paper to
  continually bring this up in order not just to demonstrate the collective character of
  the imperialist intervention today but also to illustrate that the imperialist powers
  used the Kuwaiti takeover by Iraq as a pretext around which to unite, notwithstanding
  their sharp divisions and contradictory interests.</p>

  <p>Just as in 1916, it is the division of the spoils that is being secretly negotiated
  today, as new Sykes-Picot treaties are drafted behind the scenes.</p>

  <h4>Not satisfied with lesser role</h4>

  <p>The recalcitrance and lack of cooperative spirit that has lately surfaced on the
  part of Japan and Germany reflects a deep-seated antagonism arising out of the fact
  that each of them consider themselves the equal of the United States. Japanese capital
  may even view itself as more than equal as an industrial and technological power.</p>

  <p>They would each be only too glad to participate on a more equal basis in order to
  obtain the requisite share of the booty. Moreover, they too would be interested in
  proving their military prowess technologically. They would be just as eager to
  demonstrate the effectiveness of their weapons were they permitted by the U.S. to
  revise the 1945 treaties which have inhibited them up to this time.</p>

  <p>In their eyes they suffer for past sins while U.S. finance capital poses as the
  repository of moral virtue. All of this is repugnant to countries which, while
  vanquished powers in an earlier period, have now grown to full stature industrially and
  technologically but are still accorded an unequal status in such an important military
  engagement as the collective subjugation of the Arabian peninsula.</p>

  <p>The longer the war lasts, the greater the possibility that the irreconcilable
  contradictions among the imperialist powers will pull them apart. What if the current
  offensive falls short of the avowed objective of driving Iraq to capitulation? Or what
  if it pushes the Iraqi regime to the very extreme, forcing them to use chemical
  weapons, which the U.S. could then use as a pretext for employing its own weapons of
  much greater mass destruction?</p>

  <p>If the war results in mass rebellions, then the U.S., contrary to its own interests,
  will feel obligated to accord Germany and Japan a greater share and pull them in
  militarily in order to more effectively deal with the mass insurgencies both in the
  oppressed countries and also at home.</p>

  <p>The hesitation and indecision in the White House before taking the plunge to a
  ground war is based on the many problems inherent if the ground offensive becomes
  stalled. If popular uprisings become the order of the day, if new strains and stresses
  appear in the imperialist coalition, then the entire venture, which seemed such an easy
  source for a great accumulation of super-profits, could turn out to be their great
  undoing.</p>

  <h4>Mass consciousness a big factor</h4>

  <p>This is not the era of gunboat diplomacy, when the imperialists could subjugate a
  people by sending a few ships full of Marines. It's the era when the masses have become
  a formidable factor.</p>

  <p>For the first time in history, they have the potential to take into their own hands
  the wealth they have created. As long ago as 1910, Lenin was able to say that no ruling
  class can conduct a war, can even carry out its normal function of exploitation in
  stable, peaceful times without taking into account the preeminent role of the masses in
  contemporary capitalist society.</p>

  <p>Certainly, no big war can be taken on. No matter to what heights technology has
  risen, imperialism is completely dependent on mass support and involvement. If this is
  true for the metropolitan imperialist countries, it is doubly, triply true for the vast
  oceans of oppressed men and women on all continents. The imperialist system cannot
  operate without them. And least of all can the oppressors conduct a genocidal war in
  such a key and explosive area as the Middle East without ultimately evoking a
  torrential storm of resistance.</p>

  <p>In its early stages this mass consciousness expresses itself in a struggle for
  national liberation in which the workers play a key role. That the struggle takes the
  form of national liberation movements should not obscure for us the fact that the
  masses have been able to be aroused because of the development of capitalism.</p>

  <p>The skill, talent and ability of the masses of Iraqi people in dealing with their
  own technology, and being able to absorb and utilize the technology from the
  imperialist countries, shows the high level of their development. What might have taken
  many decades earlier they've done in a few years.</p>

  <p>That is universal today; it is not just a feature of Iraq. It is what made it
  possible for the Russian, Chinese, Korean and Cuban workers to vanquish imperialism.
  And while it is a product of the dynamism of imperialism, it will ultimately deliver a
  death-blow to the imperialists.</p>
