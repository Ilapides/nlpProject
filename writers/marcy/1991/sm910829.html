  <h1>Gorbachev, Yeltsin back in with imperialist help</h1>

  <h2>After Yletsin's call for general strike fizzles</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Aug. 29, 1991)</h5>

  <p>August 21 &mdash; A coalition of military officers, party officials and security
  forces has made an ill-fated attempt to halt the process of capitalist restoration in
  the USSR.</p>

  <p>In their news conference and statements the emergency committee tried to assure the
  imperialist bourgeoisie that they only meant to restore order and proceed with the
  reforms instituted by Gorbachev. But the world capitalists immediately recognized it as
  an attempt to overthrow the governing group headed by Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin is the president of the Russian Federation and the most outspoken
  reactionary leader of the bourgeois counterrevolution. He tried to mobilize mass
  support from the working class in order to shore up the narrow stratum of bourgeois
  elements in the USSR that is his base of support. Appearing before the world press, he
  called on the nearly 150 million workers in the USSR to go out on a general strike.</p>

  <p>It soon became evident, however, that even though he had available to him not only
  the world capitalist media but his own radio station, which could reach every nook and
  corner of the Soviet Union, the strike call fizzled.</p>

  <h4>Workers stay put</h4>

  <p>All media accounts agree on this. Except for unspecified numbers of coal miners in
  Siberia and the Don Bass, the workers did not heed Yeltsin's strike call. Even in
  Moscow itself, Yeltsin's stronghold, all the factories were operating on Aug. 20 and
  21, including the huge Zil auto plant and the Stolichnaya vodka distillery.</p>

  <p>Moscow cab driver Nikolai Zavyanov told a Washington Post reporter: "About
  three-quarters of the drivers I've talked to at the stations and the airports said the
  coup is OK, so long as it gets some food on our plates." Even with the troop movements
  and demonstrations, Moscow has functioned normally from the beginning of the coup
  attempt until the present time. Reuter, the British news agency, remarked that the
  workers at the giant Tyumen oil field also ignored the strike call.</p>

  <p>Despite unrelenting TV coverage here, there have been no interviews with striking
  Soviet workers, not even the coal miners.</p>

  <p>Could it be that the workers didn't know about the strike? But the Yeltsin forces
  had access to their own radio station and were broadcasting unimpeded. Moreover, as
  Western officials have remarked with surprise, the move by the military was not
  accompanied by any attempt to cut communications in Moscow or elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Failing to get any significant response from the working class, the Yeltsin
  counterrevolutionary forces, and more important the imperialist governments backing
  them, panicked.</p>

  <h4>Massive imperialist intervention</h4>

  <p>The imperialists moved in en masse to shore up the Gorbachev-Yeltsin regime. This
  proved decisive.</p>

  <p>What followed was characterized by New York Times (Aug. 21) analyst Andrew Rosenthal
  as an attempt by the Bush administration "to influence Soviet politics more directly
  than anytime in the more than 70 years since American forces fought with the
  counterrevolutionary army against the Bolsheviks in the Russian civil war of
  1918-19."</p>

  <p>Bush, Prime Minister John Major of Britain, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
  and President Francois Mitterrand of France made frantic calls directly to Yeltsin to
  immediately shore up his pro-restorationist forces. At the same time, these capitalist
  governments shed crocodile tears about their lack of influence in the situation &mdash;
  for the benefit of the media.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin sent his "foreign minister," Andrei Kozirev, to Brussels to meet with U.S.
  Secretary of State James Baker, who was there for an urgently called meeting of NATO,
  the military alliance of the U.S. and European imperialists. Kozirev had instructions
  to form a government in exile in the West if the military coup attempt succeeded.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin also asked Thatcher, hated in Britain for her virulently anti-worker and
  anti-socialist policies, to head up an international committee to investigate what had
  happened to Mikhail Gorbachev. The emergency committee said Gorbachev had become ill
  while on vacation in the Crimea.</p>

  <h4>Bush promotes Yeltsin to national leader</h4>

  <p>The U.S. virtually broke off diplomatic relations with the Soviet government,
  instead dealing directly with Yeltsin. Bush quickly sent his newly appointed envoy,
  multi-millionaire Robert Strauss, to Moscow, but with instructions not to present his
  credentials to the Soviet authorities. One of Strauss' first acts was to meet with
  Yeltsin &mdash; thus promoting him to head of state in a slap in the face to the many
  republics outside Russia.</p>

  <p>The foreign ministers of the 12 European Community imperialist nations, meeting in
  The Hague, cut off more than $1 billion in food credits and technical aid to the USSR.
  Japan said it would cut off all aid. The secretary general of NATO, Manfred Woerner,
  threatened to freeze planned military cutbacks in Europe. In the U.S., Secretary of
  Defense Richard Cheney and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, architects of the
  Gulf war, rushed back to Washington from their vacations for an emergency meeting of
  the National Security Council.</p>

  <p>All the time, the Bush administration and the other leading imperialists kept up a
  constant flow of contact with Yeltsin, shoring him up.</p>

  <p>At first they hoped his appeal would bring about a Solidarity-style general strike
  of the Polish type. But after a day, Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew
  Brzezinski, admitted on ABC-TV's Nightline (Aug. 20) that there was no response to
  Yeltsin's call. Brzezinski hinted that the imperialist media &mdash; especially Voice
  of America, Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, the BBC and similar stations beamed to
  the USSR from Germany and France, should step up their propaganda. In another press
  statement, he also urged that the imperialists give Yeltsin "unambiguous, energetic
  political and moral support." (New York Times, Aug. 21) It was a clear call for
  intervention.</p>

  <p>Private capital has made such extensive inroads into the Soviet Union in the
  perestroika years that the media here can now matter-of-factly report that Yeltsin is
  surrounded by "private security guards" and "private detectives" from agencies with
  names like Bells and Alex (New York Times, Aug. 21). They are equipped with automatic
  weapons, bulletproof vests, camouflage suits, gas masks and Molotov cocktails and are
  deployed throughout the "White House" &mdash; Yeltsin's headquarters.</p>

  <p>We have maintained all along in these pages for several years now that the forces of
  the bourgeoisie in the USSR are a narrow stratum and cannot carry through a full-scale
  restoration of capitalism on their own. They cannot manage their own affairs on a
  capitalist basis. So even the imperialist bourgeoisie feared advancing them credits or
  loans without getting control over the economic and political institutions.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin's failure to get the workers' support in the same manner as Lech Walesa was
  able to in Poland prompted the world imperialist bourgeoisie to move feverishly,
  intervening most aggressively in defense of Gorbachev and Yeltsin and restoring them to
  power. Without the imperialist intervention, the Gorbachev-Yeltsin coalition could not
  have prevailed.</p>

  <h4>Bonaparte, Blanqui, and Marx</h4>

  <p>The coalition of different elements from within the state apparatus that made up the
  emergency committee is what Marxists call a Bonapartist regime, one that straddles the
  class forces at a time of extreme crisis. The political leadership relied on the
  military and police to maintain order and stability. Until the coup attempt, they went
  along with Gorbachev. They were split between the bourgeois and socialist sectors in
  the USSR, with no definite program on how to get out of the crisis.</p>

  <p>Their strategy in attempting a coup d'etat, however, were more reminiscent of
  Auguste Blanqui than Bonaparte.</p>

  <p>Blanqui (1805-1881) was the organizer of a revolutionary secret society who was
  prominent in every revolutionary upheaval in France until his death. Blanqui relied
  upon the conspiracy of a small group against the reactionary ruling class, thinking
  that if they succeeded in carrying out a blow against the state, the masses would
  follow.</p>

  <p>Karl Marx, while calling Blanqui a great revolutionary, criticized his tactics as
  futile, since they relied on small conspiracies of a select group of people who tried
  to substitute themselves for the masses. This often paralyzes the mass movement for,
  when it fails, the attack against the state is turned into an attack against the masses
  by the state.</p>

  <p>As distinguished from Blanquism, Marxism sees that no small group can substitute
  itself for the masses. Marxism relies on the masses and therefore organizes the
  workers' party, which is the advance guard of the working class.</p>

  <p>Answering critics who said that the Bolsheviks' plans for an insurrection were
  Blanquist, Lenin wrote in a letter to the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party
  (Oct. 16-17, 1917) just before the party seized power in the October Revolution, "a
  military conspiracy is Blanquism if it is not organized by the party of a definite
  class, if its organizers have not reckoned with the political situation in general and
  the international situation in particular...."</p>

  <p>How interesting that Lenin in his letter warned the party that they had not only to
  reckon with the political situation at home but the international situation in
  particular. At the time Lenin was writing, the imperialist bourgeoisie was virtually
  exhausted from the imperialist war. The situation was favorable for a mass
  insurrection. Nevertheless, Lenin took great pains to emphasize the particular
  significance that imperialist intervention would have for the fate of the
  revolution.</p>

  <p>It was a serious blunder on the part of the emergency coalition to have in any way
  believed that the imperialist bourgeoisie would not almost instantaneously recognize
  their action as an attempt to overthrow the Gorbachev-Yeltsin coalition. No amount of
  reassurance that they would retain the so-called market economy and confine themselves
  to maintaining social order, fight crime, etc., could possibly have impressed the
  bankers and industrialists of Western imperialism, least of all the Pentagon. These
  vague assurances would only confuse the masses, not the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>It is easy to level attacks against the emergency committee for the previous record
  some of them had of support for the Gorbachev program. Whatever mistakes they may have
  made in organization, timing and so on are of minor significance. Even Blanqui himself,
  who was a master tactician, made many errors.</p>

  <p>What is of decisive significance in this case is not to have realized that a cold
  takeover of the state apparatus and deposing Gorbachev and Yeltsin would enrage the
  imperialist bourgeoisie. In the final analysis it would impel the bourgeoisie toward
  extreme adventurism, unless there was solid mass support for the coup from the
  beginning. This in turn means that the coup had to be carried out either simultaneously
  with or immediately following a mass insurrection.</p>

  <p>A naked military move, without the awareness of the masses, without organizing and
  propagandizing for it openly in the way the Bolsheviks did, would leave them open for
  defeat.</p>

  <h4>Need for socialist program</h4>

  <p>After declaring their authority and moving troops into Moscow and other areas, the
  emergency committee did pledge to address some economic issues, for instance promising
  to set up brigades to bring in the harvest and construct much-needed housing. This
  would only be helpful, however, if they could mobilize the masses on a socialist basis.
  If not, they would have to straddle the fence between a market economy and the
  socialist sector, and would fare no better than the Gorbachev reforms, sliding further
  into capitalist restoration.</p>

  <p>As it is, the failure of the attempted overturn has undoubtedly strengthened the
  restorationist forces. But it's by no means a definitive triumph. It's only one phase
  of a protracted struggle. The working class has not yet spoken out, let alone made its
  move.</p>

  <p>The revolutionary class consciousness of the workers has not yet come to the
  surface, but it surely will. The economic chaos caused by dismantling the socialist
  sector will bring untold misery, particularly as it takes place in the midst of a
  worldwide capitalist crisis. The capitalists find themselves in the kind of impasse
  where they can scarcely avoid an economic catastrophe at home, let alone dish out huge
  amounts of cash to shore up a regime in the USSR that has to govern more than 290
  million people.</p>
