  <h1>The relentless economic decline</h1>

  <h2>Aftermath of the Gulf War</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 25, 1991)</h5>

  <p>If even a few big-business economists were dispassionate with respect to their
  profession, they would have been forced by the Gulf War to make some fundamental
  revisions of their ideas regarding the effects of war on the functioning of the
  capitalist system. The aftermath of the Gulf War reveals a highly significant
  phenomenon that is only now coming clearly into focus.</p>

  <h4>Wars and jobs</h4>

  <p>It has been standard bourgeois economic theory, whether openly expressed or not,
  that a big war ends a depression and, once the war is over, a new cycle of capitalist
  development begins. The stagnation and stagflation of the late seventies and early
  eighties are attributed to the fact that there was no really big war in that period.
  True, there was Grenada, the merciless bombing of Libya, the shelling and destruction
  in Lebanon, not to speak of U.S. mercenary activity around the globe, particularly in
  Latin America and Africa. But none of this amounted to a big war in bourgeois common
  parlance.</p>

  <p>This theory that a war brings prosperity and stops capitalist recession has been
  widely acclaimed even in sections of the labor movement, and in particular in those
  industries related to the military-industrial complex. Wide sections of bourgeois
  public opinion have been deeply affected by this, and have shown their readiness to
  support capitalist war precisely because they believe it either safeguards their jobs
  or will pull them out of a recession.</p>

  <p>Whenever there's any talk of cutting back the gargantuan military budget, the
  Pentagon immediately sets in motion scare stories about the closing of military bases
  in small towns. This usually has the effect of getting their congressional
  representatives to curry favor with the military in order to forestall the closings.
  Secretary of Defense Cheney was all too aware of this when he announced base closings
  last week.</p>

  <p>The stock market crash of 1987, whatever else it might have been, was a storm signal
  that something was not right in the economic organism of finance capital. And even
  though it was all "fixed" by a huge infusion of money from the Federal Reserve into the
  banking system to avert a total collapse, the economy thereafter began to slowly
  decline. By August 2, 1990, when the U.S. invasion of the Gulf began, it was widely
  accepted by the bourgeoisie that the country was in recession.</p>

  <p>The theoreticians of the ruling class, the paid apologists for the capitalist
  system, stuck to their guns and doggedly adhered to their original idea regarding the
  effect of big wars on the economy. Small wars like Grenada may have no effect, they
  reckoned, precisely because of their "miniature" size. What the economy needed was one
  big push, like pushing a stalled auto, after which it would run on its own. The war
  would give that push, and the economy would quickly begin to accelerate. The war would
  spark a new cycle of capitalist development.</p>

  <h4>Gulf War fails to reverse decline</h4>

  <p>It is as plain as daylight that the Gulf War was indeed a very big war in the amount
  of human beings and production it consumed, the personnel and materiel deployed, not to
  speak of the incredible amount of destruction it caused to Kuwait, Iraq and the
  environment, all of which will require years of rehabilitation.</p>

  <p>But what is the current trend of the capitalist economy? Has this bloody imperialist
  war accelerated economic activity, even to a small extent? Has it at least arrested the
  decline? The answer to these exceptionally critical questions is no on both counts.</p>

  <p>This is the most staggering fact to emerge from the Gulf War. The carnage has not
  altered the fundamental direction of the capitalist economy, and the ruling class
  economists have had to publicly admit it. The government itself has now released a mass
  of statistics which prove beyond any doubt that the capitalist recession is on. And no
  amount of "confidence building" will undo it.</p>

  <p>Not even United Technologies, a most important segment of the military-industrial
  complex in the Northeast, can escape the decline. The Wall Street Journal of April 17
  reports that UTC announced its "first-quarter earnings plunged 70% as the recession
  battered important businesses serving commercial airlines, buildings systems and
  automotive industries. . . . `This is the first time that all three of these core
  commercial markets simultaneously have been at the bottom of their industry cycle,'
  said Robert F. Daniell, chairman and chief executive officer."</p>

  <p>Analyst Howard Rubel said, "Everything that's bad with the economy is showing up in
  UTC's earnings."</p>

  <p>The one area of UTC's business not affected is its contracts with the Pentagon. But
  the purpose of the military contracts is to stimulate the civilian or commercial
  economy. That's not happening.</p>

  <h4>A narcotic that becomes a depressant</h4>

  <p>Military production is supposed to inject new life into the economy, like a shot of
  a powerful narcotic. But after so many years of enormous borrowing to pay for an area
  of production which is parasitic and adds nothing to the real growth of the economy,
  this stimulus eventually turns into a depressant.</p>

  <p>Military commodities are commodities <em>sui generis</em> (of a peculiar kind). They
  are not produced to be sold on the open market. Most of the time, their fulfillment as
  commodities is realized through sale by a prearranged contractg where the government is
  the sole customer.</p>

  <p>The military-industrial complex has produced more weapons than can ever be used.
  They must be constantly updated, and the government has to pay the cost of
  obsolescence. This pumping up of the military budget is the product of a phase of
  capitalist overproduction which can't go on endlessly.</p>

  <p>Now this process has finally reached the point where a big war has been launched and
  it still hasn't helped. New figures substantiate that the big war did not give that
  necessary and indispensable push to revive or accelerate capitalist production.</p>

  <h4>Economic indices all point down</h4>

  <p>The Federal Reserve announced on April 16 that industrial production fell 0.3% in
  March. What is significant is that it was the sixth straight monthly decline and the
  longest string of losses since the 1981-82 recession.</p>

  <p>This new data also showed that industrial production fell at a 9.25% annual rate
  during the first quarter, after falling 7% in the final three months of 1990. As though
  this were not enough, housing starts fell 9.3% in March, according to the Commerce
  Department, and for the first three months of 1991 housing starts were down as much as
  36.8% from a year ago.</p>

  <p>This brought a big decline in the first-quarter earnings of Citicorp and led to
  "dismay" on Wall Street, in the words of the Wall Street Journal. Newsday of April 17
  described it this way: "Citicorp Chairman John S. Reed, who addressed the company's
  annual meeting of shareholders, said in attributing the bank's problems to the
  continuing downturn, `As we manage our business, we recognize that the real estate
  market continues to weaken and that it is not likely to recover for quite some time.
  Nor is there reason to expect a robust recovery.' Reed expressed little optimism for a
  quick turnaround in the economy, noting that there is little evidence yet of an
  economic rebound."</p>

  <p>Coming from this behemoth of a multinational banking corporation, this speaks far
  louder than any of the optimistic words exuded by the Bush administration.</p>

  <p>The capitalist media did its part in generating tremendous optimism that the
  military victory would spark a so-called consumer market, which would then lead to the
  expansion of the gross national product with increased sales of cars, homes, home
  appliances and so on. But this has not happened. This kind of confidence manufactured
  by the media is easy to turn on and off. What's harder is to create jobs, even in their
  own industry of newspapers, radio and TV, which is now experiencing cutbacks and
  layoffs.</p>

  <h4>Greenspan and the New World Order</h4>

  <p>With all the talk of the New World Order, of how the world economy is integrated and
  only needs a coordinator like the U.S. government to see that it functions smoothly, it
  nevertheless turns out that the interdependent world system, while it may be integrated
  as an economic organization, is not at all politically coordinated, nor can it be.</p>

  <p>It is exceptionally interesting to see how the situation is handled politically in
  its most sensitive area, that of banking, credit and monetary circulation of capital.
  You would think nothing unusual is happening there, nothing that gives the bourgeoisie
  anything to worry about.</p>

  <p>However, the august New York Times in a front-page story on April 8 made a startling
  announcement.</p>

  <p>"Amid a debate at the Federal Reserve Board," the Times said, "over whether lower
  interest rates are needed to help the nation out of recession, the central bank's
  policy-making body has curtailed the authority of its chairman, Alan Greenspan, to
  reduce rates on his own, high government officials said over the weekend."</p>

  <p>This story is of keen interest to the Wall Street "community," but the other papers
  did not pick it up. Nor was there much discussion about it in the media. The Wall
  Street Journal referred to it a few days later as though it were a passing, routine
  affair.</p>

  <p>Curtailing the authority of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, whose powers
  have often been described as second only to the president &mdash; doesn't that have
  enormous significance? What does it mean? Obviously, it is the result of an inner
  struggle.</p>

  <p>Without going into the economic significance of the lowering of interest rates, it
  has immediate profound political significance in relationship to the integrated
  capitalist world economy and the efforts to have a supreme coordinator like the U.S.
  government.</p>

  <p>No one has spoken with higher authority on economic and financial affairs than the
  Federal Reserve chairman. His is not only the voice of the central bank, but of the
  government. This was especially true during the Carter and Reagan administrations when
  Paul Volcker headed the Fed.</p>

  <p>Lower interest rates mean that the central bankers of the other imperialist powers,
  especially Germany and Japan, but including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and
  others, feel freer to make deals manipulating their own currencies. Even in the USSR,
  where Alan Greenspan went in person to explain the magic of the capitalist market,
  giving particular emphasis to banking and finance, this move surely would jolt
  confidence in imperialist finance, coordinated by the U.S.</p>

  <h4>Pentagon rethinking what to do</h4>

  <p>The military victory in the Gulf has not translated into raising the economic
  stature of U.S. capital. So if it hasn't led to economic gains, what good was it?</p>

  <p>This conspiracy to take over the Middle East is something like an executory contract
  which still has to be fulfilled. The result has to be super-profits. At the present
  time, it has only brought financial liabilities to U.S. imperialism in the form of an
  increased federal deficit.</p>

  <p>So, despite the movement of over half a million troops to the Middle East, despite
  all the devastation, the war has given them no respite from the economic decline. This
  explains why the Pentagon's strategists are rethinking the whole question of the Kurds.
  They are pouring out nauseatingly hypocritical humanitarianism in such a way as to turn
  relief for the Kurds, in whom they have never had any real interest, into yet another
  military operation.</p>

  <p>Just a week ago, when British Prime Minister John Major proposed to make way for a
  so-called enclave in northern Iraq for the Kurdish refugees, the Pentagon turned it
  down. Now they are seeking a way to implement such a plan, which will mean the creation
  of a virtual colonial possession for the U.S. and its allies in the heart of northern
  Iraq.</p>

  <p>They are rethinking their strategy. While at the moment a substantial withdrawal of
  U.S. troops appears to be taking place in southern Iraq, they are digging in deeper in
  the north.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the anticipated gold rush to Eastern Europe is turning into a disaster. It
  is in fact accelerating the recession in Western Europe. The imperialist European
  Economic Community was supposed to experience a capitalist boom as a result of the
  annexation of the GDR. But this boast about capitalist Europe becoming, as the New York
  Times of April 16 says, the "locomotive of the world economy," has proven to be hollow.
  Nothing of the sort is happening. "Instead, Western Europe's economy has stalled, with
  the Persian Gulf crisis pushing much of the Continent . . . to the brink of recession,"
  says the Times.</p>

  <p>All of this points in one direction &mdash; that the capitalist world cannot long
  avoid an economic collapse.</p>
