  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: The food crisis in the Soviet Union (Sept. 19,
  1991)</title>

  <h1>The food crisis in the Soviet Union</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Sept. 19, 1991)</h5>

  <p>September 11 &mdash; It's been only nine days since the counterrevolutinary
  camarilla in the USSR led by Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin first moved to
  illegally dissolve the Congress of People's Deputies. The Congress was the only
  all-national political body elected on the basis of universal suffrage.</p>

  <p>The ruling group claimed the country faced a "catastrophe" and that its collapse was
  imminent unless speedy measures were taken. The government is now to be run by a new,
  self-appointed grouping that supposedly has emergency measures in place, ready to save
  the situation.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the whole country is supposedly to be restructured along "democratic"
  lines. The people's deputies were presumably too clumsy, too slow, too argumentative,
  too cantankerous, and had to dissolve themselves.</p>

  <p>Threats and intimidation were there for all to see and hear, but it was necessary to
  put a good face on all this. The quicker they dissolved, the sooner conditions in the
  country would improve.</p>

  <p>Now, just a week later, this camarilla has already demonstrated its complete
  bankruptcy in regard to the crucial bread-and-butter issues it so loudly proclaimed it
  would solve.</p>

  <h4>No program for food crisis</h4>

  <p>There are articles in the bourgeois media every day about the food crisis expected
  in the USSR this winter. Prices are rising sharply while harvesting and distribution of
  the crops are in disarray. Only where the state has returned to socialist emergency
  measures &mdash; such as deploying soldiers and students to help bring in the potato
  and carrot crops &mdash; is there hope of easing the crisis.</p>

  <p>Privatization and individual private ownership of the means of production, the key
  staples of bourgeois counterrevolutionary propaganda, were widely hailed. Yet they seem
  farther off than ever.</p>

  <p>Feeding the people despite harsh weather conditions has been the most crucial task
  facing the Soviet Union in all its years of existence. Even during World War II, the
  Soviet people and armed forces were supplied with food, while the Nazi armies came to
  grief in this respect.</p>

  <p>Not long after the war, food was so plentiful that communist economists were
  preparing plans for the free distribution of bread within 15 years. This in a country
  where food production had been in a crisis since time immemorial.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev mentioned on several occasions in the late 1980s that the price of bread
  in the USSR was so cheap that children used loaves as footballs. The implication was
  that bread was <em>too</em> cheap and should be more costly.</p>

  <h4>USSR weathered Carter's grain embargo</h4>

  <p>One of the most difficult tests came when the Carter administration in January 1980
  imposed a total embargo on the sale of grain to the USSR as punishment for its support
  of the Afghan revolutionary movement and government. The U.S. not only denied farmers
  here at home a market for their grain but bludgeoned its allies abroad, including
  Europe, Argentina, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, in an attempt to force them to
  join the embargo.</p>

  <p>The embargo lasted more than a year. Yet in that time no one starved in the Soviet
  Union. Grain was harvested and successfully transported, and the population was well
  fed despite U.S. imperialist economic aggression. The USSR was able to buy grain and
  other food supplies from the very allies the Carter imperialist administration sought
  to bludgeon.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was hardship for the Soviet population. But in the end it was the
  imperialists who had to give in. Soon after taking office, in April 1981, Reagan
  rescinded the embargo. The U.S. was unable to bring the Soviet leadership to heel
  because the Soviet government had cash in hand. It was the most credit-worthy nation in
  the world. It had huge funds at its disposal, gold as well as foreign currency. Compare
  what happened a decade ago to the situation now, six years after this new wrecking crew
  led by Gorbachev began to attack socialist planning.</p>

  <h4>Production is down</h4>

  <p>Newsweek magazine of Sept. 16 has a major article on the economic situation in the
  USSR:</p>

  <p>"Food prices are going up; the price of potatoes at Moscow's state stores is
  expected to be 800 percent higher than last year. ... As the economy crumbles, food and
  fuel production is declining across the board. This year's grain harvest is expected to
  be about 195 million metric tons, down from 240 million last year. Oil production is
  expected to drop 10 percent and coal production nearly 12 percent. ... So far, economic
  reform has made some things worse."</p>

  <p>It can now be clearly seen that the big campaign by the Gorbachev administration to
  cut subsidies to the principal ministries of the government, which they pejoratively
  called monopolies, was sheer demagogy. It was necessary to cut them down, said the
  reformers, because they were bureaucratic and based upon administrative and command
  methods. So a good many ministries were replaced, including the one for
  agriculture.</p>

  <p>However, instead of bringing about democratic, less centralized and presumably more
  efficient ministries, as they had promised, they have merely displaced the old
  ministries based on socialist planning with bloated bourgeois ministries.</p>

  <p>So it was not a change from autocracy to democracy, but from a form of socialist
  planning, with all its presumed faults and bureaucratic administration, to a bourgeois
  ministry based on the free market. This group of free marketeers is now in charge of a
  centralized, socialist agricultural infrastructure. And what has been the result? A
  precipitous decline in production, according to Newsweek and many other sources.
  Nevertheless, while these reformers are continuing to dismantle the old system, they
  are limited by the dire needs of the people.</p>

  <h4>`Only communists can get the harvest in'</h4>

  <p>Roy Medvedev, until last week a member of the Congress of People's Deputies and one
  who has been hailed in the West as a historian of the Stalin era, says, "The
  [Communist] party's running the Stavropol region [a rich agricultural area] &mdash;
  they have to. No one else can get the harvest in, and that's the most important job
  facing the country right now." (Boston Globe, Sept. 8)</p>

  <p>At the 19th Party Conference in June 1988, Gorbachev admitted publicly that an acute
  food crisis loomed. But he cheerfully announced it would soon be solved. His new
  entourage of bourgeois reformist economists and reactionary bourgeois politicians had
  all counted on solving the perennial agricultural problem by quickly privatizing the
  collective farms or completely dismantling them.</p>

  <p>Even before the 19th Party Conference, Gorbachev had begun to sing paeans of praise
  to individual farming. He showered compliments on the model family farms of the West.
  And he urged rapid reorganization of the collective farms in a bourgeois direction.</p>

  <p>Once a decree was issued that promoted private farms, all the bourgeois economists,
  both East and West, expected there would be an avalanche of farmers abandoning the
  collectives. But that never really happened.</p>

  <p>Much to the surprise of the new practitioners of bourgeois economics, the collective
  farmers showed resistance to the assault upon collective property forms. This was
  interpreted by the bourgeoisie here as resistance by the local bureaucracy. But why
  would they resist &mdash; except that they are closer to the masses? The local
  bureaucracy is only a transmission belt reflecting what the collective farmers
  want.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie forgot that the farmers were wondering what would happen to their
  pensions, their social security, their children's free schools, kindergartens and the
  like if they embarked on private ventures. It turned out that only the rich, only those
  who had accumulated funds secretly, were able to take a chance. And that was on the
  basis of some government guarantees. So with all Gorbachev's innovations and
  reorganizing aimed at pushing decollectivization, only a small portion succeeded.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev himself was becoming slowly disenchanted with the progress toward
  reorganization on a bourgeois basis. But he blamed it all on bureaucratism. He finally
  agreed to appoint Yegor Ligachev, a so-called hardliner, to be in charge of
  agriculture. That way Ligachev would bear the brunt of the failures. However &mdash;
  without going into the details of the various plans and reorganizations &mdash; the
  social and political structure of the collective farms is still strong and predominant
  as against the cruel incursions of private interest and the encouragement of the
  bourgeois reformists.</p>

  <h4>Can sabotage socialism, but can't</h4>reestablish capitalism

  <p>After more than six years of experimenting, the USSR now faces a disastrous
  situation. The very problem Gorbachev described as acute in 1986, 1987 and 1988 &mdash;
  food production and distribution &mdash; is now even worse, despite all the promises of
  help that would flow as fast as water once privatization took place.</p>

  <p>What is this new wrecking crew's program as far as agriculture is concerned? It is
  and has been to privatize the agricultural sector and the food supply. But no matter
  what inroads they've made, no matter how much chaos and destruction they've brought
  about, the centralized socialist sector of the economy remains basically intact.</p>

  <p>Of course, let's not underestimate the marauding, crooked, illegal bourgeois shadow
  market and all the phony manipulations with respect to food delivery. These go on.
  Nevertheless, the socialist sector is the only one capable of functioning for the
  masses. Only it can deliver food on the basis of state-controlled prices.</p>

  <p>This is true even taking into account the increasingly manipulative character of the
  new top bureaucracy that administers agriculture, as well as the inflationary policies
  of the banking officials. The food sector, beginning with the collective farms, is
  still centrally organized according to bourgeois economist Grigory A. Yavlinsky, who is
  now a member of the interim economic steering committee appointed by the State Council
  that has usurped the powers of the Congress of People's Deputies. (New York Times,
  Sept. 9)</p>

  <p>There is no way the new ruling camarilla can function in agriculture and food
  distribution except in what remains of the centralized socialist sector. They have to
  shelve the privatization they are so anxious to adopt. They can enact laws but they
  cannot make them operate.</p>

  <p>This is the central dilemma of the new counterrevolutionary junta. They can't break
  up an ocean liner into small rowboats, especially if there are no buyers.</p>

  <h4>State Council hasn't met</h4>

  <p>Privatization on a mass scale will only bring more chaos, as it has during all the
  Gorbachev years. This new governing group said the fundamental reason for dissolving
  the Congress of People's Deputies was the looming economic and social catastrophe. The
  Congress of People's Deputies presumably was too large and too balky to act quickly.
  But after a week of the new junta's domination, the State Council, which was created to
  "re-design" (wreck) a new union government, has "given no indication of economic plans"
  to do anything. (New York Times, Sept. 9) They have not met nor have they issued any
  "communiques on any meeting or plans for the progress toward recovery promised by Mr.
  Gorbachev."</p>

  <p>Presumably this body of conspirators would quickly present a plan for a new union
  government. But it would have to be of a looser type. Indeed, the bourgeois economist
  Yavlinsky says there is "no place for reform on an all-union level." All they have been
  able to produce is a continuing process of disintegration.</p>

  <p>In all the years of the Soviet Union since the end of the civil war and imperialist
  intervention, production increased. Now, during the last two years of the Gorbachev
  administration, the actual gross national product has declined. Inflation is rising.
  There is no plan of any kind &mdash; not even bourgeois, let alone socialist &mdash;
  for resuming production.</p>

  <p>The new camarilla that has taken over is basically a group of technocrats, endlessly
  concerned with their own problems in each republic. But to be successful, each republic
  is in one way or another economically dependent on all-round union economic
  operations.</p>

  <p>However, the country is moving in exactly the opposite direction. Nothing this junta
  does can reverse the process. They simply don't have an overall plan, as Yavlinsky
  himself admitted. And only an overall plan can possibly avert the looming economic
  catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Hence the frantic calls for the imperialists to shell out more money from their
  swollen treasuries. But this is slow in coming.</p>

  <p>The prospect of the camarilla acting in a united manner, with an overall resolve to
  overcome the impending economic catastrophe, is nil. It is only a transitional form
  incapable of establishing a full-fledged capitalist system. What is more likely to
  emerge is an increasingly authoritarian grouping leading to a fascist dictatorship.</p>

  <p>This new group has been pounding into the heads of the masses that it will
  decentralize. It is copying from some bourgeois economists in the U.S. who think that
  smaller is better, when the whole reality of the Soviet Union has been to build
  large-scale, mass-production industrial, scientific and technological units. This
  should not, of course, exclude smaller projects, especially pilot programs and the
  like. What the Soviet Union needed, however, was not economic decentralization but
  greater democratization of socialist planning. Instead, this new crew opted for a
  bourgeois economy. Therein lies the problem.</p>

  <p>There is certainly no way to restore a thriving Soviet Union or even a thriving
  Russia or Ukraine or Kazakhstan as long as the reforms stimulate national antagonisms
  and make them unable to agree among themselves on how to govern.</p>

  <p>The workers are sure to commence their resistance movement as each new day reveals
  more sharply the ineptitude, gross incompetence, and venomous internecine rivalries and
  animosities promoted and stimulated by the bourgeois, pro-capitalist reforms.</p>
