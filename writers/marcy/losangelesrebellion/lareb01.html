  <h5>A Marxist Defense of the LA Rebellion [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Marxism and insurrection</h1>

  <p>The brutal suppression of the Los Angeles insurrection offers a classic example of
  the relationship of bourgeois democracy to the capitalist state. The statistics most
  eloquently demonstrate the relationship.</p>

  <p>The number of arrests in Los Angeles County alone as of May 5 is 12,111 and still
  rising. The number of injuries has reached a staggering 2,383. Several hundred are
  critically wounded. Thus the number of dead at present will undoubtedly continue to
  rise.</p>

  <p>All this has to be seen in light of the repressive forces amassed by the city, state
  and federal government: 8,000 police, 9,800 National Guard troops, 1,400 Marines, 1,800
  Army soldiers and 1,000 federal marshals. (Associated Press, May 5)</p>

  <p><strong>At the bottom of it all</strong> Marxism differs from all forms of bourgeois
  sociology in this most fundamental way: all bourgeois social sciences are directed at
  covering up and concealing &mdash; sometimes in the most shameful way &mdash; the
  predatory class character of present-day capitalist society. Marxism, on the other
  hand, reveals in the clearest and sharpest manner not only the antagonisms that
  continually rend asunder present-day bourgeois society but also their basis &mdash; the
  ownership of the means of production by a handful of millionaires and billionaires.</p>

  <p>Bourgeois sociology must leave out of consideration the fact that society is divided
  into exploiter and exploited, oppressors of nationalities and oppressed. The basis for
  both the exploitation and oppression is the ownership of the means of production by an
  ever-diminishing group of the population that controls the vital arteries of
  contemporary society. They are the bourgeoisie, the ruling class. At the other end of
  the axis is the proletariat of all nationalities, the producer of all the fabulous
  wealth. Material wealth has been vastly increasing along with the masses' productivity
  of labor. But only 1 percent of the population amasses the lion's share of what the
  workers produce while a greater and greater mass is impoverished.</p>

  <p><strong>Flattering 'the people'</strong></p>

  <p>Especially during periods of parliamentary elections as in the U.S. today, bourgeois
  sociologists are full of effusive praise for "the people." Each and every capitalist
  politician embraces "the people" with what often becomes disgusting flattery. The
  people are everything during periods when the bourgeoisie needs them most of all, as
  during its many predatory wars. Indeed, at no time is the bourgeoisie so attached to
  the people as when it is in deepest crisis.</p>

  <p>But the people &mdash; the unarmed masses &mdash; become nothing, not even human
  beings, when they are in the full throes of rebellion against the bourgeoisie's
  monstrous police and military machine. Does not the Los Angeles insurrection prove all
  this?</p>

  <p>No amount of praise, no amount of flattery, can substitute for a clear-cut
  delineation of the class divisions that perpetually rend society apart.</p>

  <p>To the bourgeois social scientists the masses are the object of history. Marxist
  theory, on the other hand, demonstrates that the masses are the subject of history.
  Where they are the objects of history they are manipulated as raw material to suit the
  aims of ruling class exploitation. They become the subject of history only when they
  rise to the surface in mass revolutionary action.</p>

  <p>Their rising as in Los Angeles is what Karl Marx called the locomotive of history.
  Their revolutionary struggle accelerates history bringing to the fore the real
  character of the mass movement.</p>

  <p>To speak of the people in general terms, without cutting through the propaganda to
  reveal the relations of exploiter to exploited, of oppressor to oppressed, is to
  participate in covering up the reality. <strong>Oppression of a whole
  people</strong></p>

  <p>Most indispensable for an understanding of contemporary society is the relation
  between oppressor and oppressed nationalities. One cannot apply Marxism to any
  meaningful extent without first recognizing the existence of national oppression
  &mdash; the oppression of a whole people by capitalist imperialism. This is one of the
  most characteristic features of the present world reality.</p>

  <p>This concept above all others must be kept foremost if we hope to understand what
  has happened in Los Angeles and in other major cities of this country.</p>

  <p>The insurrection and the way it is being suppressed closely follow the exposition by
  Frederick Engels in his book "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the
  State," and later brought up to date by Lenin in "State and Revolution."</p>

  <p>What is the state? What is democracy?</p>

  <p>Bourgeois sociologists and scholars and above all capitalist politicians always
  confound the relationship between the two. They often treat them as a single
  phenomenon. In reality, the relation between democracy and the state is based on an
  inner struggle &mdash; between form and essence.</p>

  <p>The state can take on many different forms. A state can have the form of a bourgeois
  democracy; it can be a monarchy; it may be ruled by a military junta. And in modern
  society, on the very edge of the 21st century, it may have a totalitarian or fascist
  form.</p>

  <p>Whatever its form, its essence is determined by which class is dominant economically
  and consequently also dominant politically. In contemporary society, this means the
  rule of the imperialist bourgeoisie over the proletariat and the oppressed
  nationalities.</p>

  <p><strong>Bourgeoisie needs different forms of rule</strong></p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie cannot maintain its class rule by relying solely on one particular
  form of the state. It can't rely only on the governing officialdom &mdash; even those
  at the very summit of the state, even when they are solely millionaires and
  billionaires. Under such circumstances, should there be an imperialist war or a deep
  capitalist crisis that leads to ferment among the masses the bourgeois state would be
  vulnerable to revolutionary overthrow.</p>

  <p>But the state is not just the officialdom &mdash; who presume to govern in the
  interest of all the people. The state in its essential characteristics is the
  organization, to quote Engels, of a "special public force" that consists not merely of
  armed men and women but of material appendages, prisons and repressive institutions of
  all kinds.</p>

  <p>The decisive basic ingredient of the state is the armed forces with all their
  material appendages and all who service them. Most noteworthy are the prisons &mdash;
  more and more of them &mdash; calculated to break the spirit of millions of the most
  oppressed while pretending to some mock forms of rehabilitation. All the most modern
  means &mdash; mental and physical &mdash; are used to demoralize and deprave the
  character of those incarcerated. These repressive institutions, this public force,
  appears so omnipotent against the unarmed mass of the oppressed and exploited. But it
  stands out as the very epitome of gentility and humaneness when it comes to
  incarcerating favored individuals, especially the very rich, who have transgressed the
  norms of capitalist law.</p>

  <p>In general then, the Los Angeles insurrection shows that democracy is a veil that
  hides the repressive character of the capitalist state. The state at all times is the
  state of the dominant class. And the objective of the special bodies of armed men and
  women is to secure, safeguard and uphold the domination of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p><strong>Growth of the state</strong></p>

  <p>Engels explained that in the course of development of capitalist society, as the
  class antagonisms grow sharper, the state &mdash; that is, the public force &mdash;
  grows stronger.</p>

  <p>Said Engels, "We have only to look at our present-day Europe where class struggle,
  rivalry and conquest has screwed up the public power to such a pitch that it threatens
  to devour the whole of society and even the state itself."</p>

  <p>Written more than 100 years ago, this refers to the growth of militarism. The
  sharpening of class and national antagonisms had even then resulted in larger and
  larger appropriations for civilian and military personnel employed for the sole purpose
  of suppressing the civil population at home and waging adventurist imperialist wars
  abroad. The state grows in proportion as class and national antagonisms develop.
  Democracy is merely a form which hides the predatory class character of the bourgeois
  state. Nothing so much proves this as the steady and consistent growth of militarism
  and the police forces in times of peace as well as war.</p>

  <p>The ruling class continually cultivates racism to keep the working class divided, in
  order to maintain its domination. This is as true at home as it is abroad. The forces
  of racism and national oppression have been deliberately stimulated by Pentagon and
  State Department policies all across the globe.</p>

  <p><strong>Marxism on violence</strong></p>

  <p>After every stage in the struggle of the workers and oppressed people, there follows
  an ideological struggle over what methods the masses should embrace to achieve their
  liberation from imperialist monopoly capital. There are always those who abjure
  violence while minimizing the initial use of violence by the ruling class. They
  denounce it in words, while in deeds they really cover it up. That's precisely what's
  happening now.</p>

  <p>Yes indeed, they readily admit the verdict in the Rodney King beating was erroneous
  and unfair. But &mdash; and here their voices grow louder &mdash; "The masses should
  not have taken to the streets and taken matters into their own hands." Their
  denunciation of the violence of the ruling class is subdued and muffled &mdash; above
  all it is hypocritical, a sheer formality. It's an indecent way of seeming to take both
  sides of the argument when what follows is in reality a condemnation of the masses.</p>

  <p>In times when the bourgeoisie is up against the wall, when the masses have risen
  suddenly and unexpectedly, the bourgeoisie gets most lyrical in abjuring violence. It
  conjures up all sorts of lies and deceits about the unruliness of a few among the
  masses as against the orderly law-abiding many.</p>

  <p>Marxism here again cuts through it all. The Marxist view of violence flows from an
  altogether different concept. It first of all distinguishes between the violence of the
  oppressors as against the responsive violence of the masses. Just to be able to
  formulate it that way is a giant step forward, away from disgusting bourgeois praise
  for nonviolence. It never occurs to any of them to show that the masses have never made
  any real leap forward with the theory of nonviolence. Timidity never made it in
  history.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Marxists do prefer nonviolent methods if the objectives the masses seek
  &mdash; freedom from oppression and exploitation &mdash; can be obtained that way. But
  Marxism explains the historical evolution of the class struggle as well as the struggle
  of oppressed nations as against oppressors.</p>

  <p><strong>Revolutions, force and violence</strong></p>

  <p>As Marx put it, "force is the midwife to every great revolution." This is what Marx
  derived from his study of the class struggle in general and of capitalist society in
  particular.</p>

  <p>None of the great revolutions has ever occurred without being accompanied by force
  and violence. And it is always the oppressor &mdash; the ruling class and the
  oppressing nationality &mdash; that is most congenitally prone to use force as soon as
  the masses raise their heads. In all the bourgeois revolutions in Europe, this new
  would-be ruling class used the masses to fight its battles against the feudal lords.
  Then, when the masses raised their heads to fight for their own liberation against the
  bourgeoisie, they were met with the most fearful and unmitigated violence. All European
  history is filled with such examples, from the revolutions of 1789 and 1848 to the
  Paris Commune of 1871. Does not the bourgeoisie, once it has tamed the proletariat at
  home, use force and violence through its vast military armada to more efficiently
  exploit and suppress the many underdeveloped nations throughout the world?</p>

  <p>It is so illuminating that Iraq, the nation subjected to the most violent, truly
  genocidal military attack in recent times, has taken upon itself to press a formal
  complaint in the UN Security Council on behalf of the embattled masses in Los Angeles
  and other cities. Iraq called on that body to condemn and investigate the nature of the
  developments here and the irony is that the head of the Security Council felt obligated
  to accept the complaint. Not even the U.S. delegate, obviously taken by surprise,
  objected.</p>

  <p>How much real difference is there between the suppression of the Paris Commune in
  1871 and that of the revolutionary rising of the masses in Los Angeles in 1992? The
  brutal suppression differs only in magnitude and not in essence. While it might seem
  that in Los Angeles national oppression alone is involved, in reality it derives from
  the class exploitation of the African American masses dating back to the days of
  slavery.</p>

  <p><strong>Watts and social legislation</strong></p>

  <p>Following the Watts insurrection the bourgeoisie made lofty promises to improve the
  situation. The Watts, Detroit, Newark and other rebellions did win significant
  concessions that eventually were enacted into law. They became the basis for a
  temporary improvement in the economic and social situation of the oppressed people.</p>

  <p>None of the progressive legislation, up to and including affirmative action, would
  have been enacted had it not been for the rebellions during the 1960s and the 1970s.
  Yet now, almost three decades after the Watts rebellion, the masses are in greater
  poverty and the repression is heavier than before. The fruits of what was won have
  withered on the vine as racism and the deterioration of economic conditions took hold
  once again. Once more the bourgeois politicians attempted to mollify the masses with
  endless promises of improvements never destined to see the light of day. This evoked a
  profound revulsion among the masses. It took only an incident like the incredible
  verdict of the rigged jury that freed the four police officers in the Rodney King
  beating to ignite a storm of revolutionary protest.</p>

  <p>If revolutionary measures are ever to have any validity, doesn't a case like this
  justify the people taking destiny into their own hands?</p>

  <p><strong>Less workers, more cops</strong></p>

  <p>How interesting that technology everywhere displaces labor, reducing the number of
  personnel.</p>

  <p>There was a time when it was hoped that the mere development of technical and
  industrial progress, the increase in mechanization and automation, would contribute to
  the well-being of the masses. This has once again shown itself to be a hollow mockery.
  The truth is that the development of higher and more sophisticated technology under
  capitalism doesn't contribute to the welfare of the masses but on the contrary, throws
  them into greater misery.</p>

  <p>What has been the general trend? The growth of technology, particularly
  sophisticated high technology, has reduced the number of workers employed in industry
  as well as in the services. The introduction of labor-saving devices and methods has
  dramatically reduced the number of workers in all fields.</p>

  <p>But the opposite trend prevails in the police forces. This is an absolutely
  incontestable fact.</p>

  <p>At one time the police patrolled the streets on foot. Maybe they used a public
  telephone for communications with headquarters. Today they are equipped with
  sophisticated gear. They ride either on motorcycles or in police cars or helicopters.
  They communicate by radio.</p>

  <p>All this should reduce the number of police. But the trend is quite the contrary: to
  increase the forces of repression. This is not geared to productivity as in industry.
  Their growth is geared to the growth of national antagonisms, the growth of racism, and
  the bourgeoisie's general anti-labor offensive.</p>

  <p>In Los Angeles, the bourgeoisie is forced to bring in federal troops to assist city
  and state authorities. The social composition of the Army is not just a cross-section
  of capitalist society. The Army and Marines, especially the infantry, have a
  preponderance of Black and Latino soldiers. What does this signify?</p>

  <p>The U.S. imperialists had to wage a technological war against Iraq out of fear that
  the preponderance of Black and Latino soldiers could end up in a disastrous rebellion;
  they might refuse to engage in a war against their sisters and brothers in the
  interests of the class enemy. That's why the armed forces never really got into the
  ground war that seemed at first to be in the offing.</p>

  <p>In Los Angeles the local police and state forces were inadequate. Only because the
  masses were unarmed was the bourgeoisie able to suppress what was in truth an
  insurrection &mdash; a revolutionary uprising. <strong>Spontaneity and
  consciousness</strong> As Marx would put it, such a rising is a festival of the masses.
  The incidental harm is far outweighed by the fact that it raises the level of the
  struggle to a higher plateau. The wounds inflicted by the gendarmerie will be healed.
  The lessons will be learned: that a spontaneous uprising has to be supported with
  whatever means are available; that a great divide exists between the leaders and the
  masses.</p>

  <p>No viable class or nation in modern capitalist society can hope to take destiny in
  its own hands by spontaneous struggles alone. Spontaneity as an element of social
  struggle must beget its own opposite: leadership and organization. Consciousness of
  this will inevitably grow.</p>

  <p class="c1"><small>&mdash; May 5, 1992</small></p>

  <h2>Bush's feet of clay</h2>
  
  <p>Considering the torrent of words the ruling class has used
  to express its horror, shock, and utter disbelief over the insurrection in Los Angeles
  that shook its rule to the very foundations, it's amazing how pitifully little
  attention has been given to the insurrection's effect worldwide. It took Bush himself
  to slightly draw the curtain. "I was embarrassed," he said in his nationwide television
  speech after his visit to the devastated area. Embarrassed?! This is a masterful
  understatement. An unprecedented humiliation is what it was.

  <p>Just a few weeks ago, Bush was the leading representative of the master class, the
  architect of the "new world order." This is the new order for not just the "free world"
  but the entire world. But the masses in Los Angeles have made the word "order" an
  irony.</p>

  <p>A few weeks ago Bush was the executive who had ordered Desert Storm and the
  destruction of Iraq. His name aroused fear and apprehension all around the earth. Now
  Bush, the modern ruler hiding behind the armor of predatory militarism, stands naked.
  Like the emperor in the old folk tale, Bush has no clothes.</p>

  <p>Bush and the ruling class he represents saw themselves as rulers not only of the
  Atlantic and Pacific but the Seven Seas. To the amazement of the whole world, the
  masses of Los Angeles in one unprecedented, utterly incredible social convulsion turned
  the Neptune of the Seven Seas into a sawdust Caesar.</p>

  <p><strong>Who will angry soldiers fight?</strong></p>

  <p>Now more than ever the combined officer corps of the Air Force, the Army, the
  Marines and the Navy will have to think twice about a new Desert Storm. They will have
  to pay attention to what Sen. Sam Nunn, the long-time chairperson of the Senate Armed
  Services Committee, said when Congress debated having a volunteer military.</p>

  <p>Nunn warned that the white personnel of the armed services are diminishing while the
  Black and other "minorities," as he put it, are growing numerically larger. It is a
  consequence, he said, of the volunteer system, which he deprecated. He favored
  conscription instead. But the Congress, aware of the anti-war sentiment sweeping the
  country at that time, turned down conscription. If the naval command now dares to think
  in terms of a genocidal Desert Storm kind of attack, they can conjure up the ghost of
  the Potemkin mutiny in addition to the Los Angeles insurrection. It is not a happy
  thought for the militarists.</p>

  <p>For so many years the empire of finance capital has seemed invincible and
  unconquerable. Can the Los Angeles events affect U.S. worldwide military supremacy?
  Does the insurrection fundamentally change all this? Does it bring up, as though from
  the rearguard, an utterly new phenomenon, a heretofore unexposed vulnerability?</p>

  <p><strong>Rome's dependence on slavery</strong></p>

  <p>The ancient empire of Rome, with its military prowess, also seemed everlasting
  &mdash; as long as chattel slavery remained stable and endurable. Rome's great military
  feats, its artistic monuments, its aqueducts, theater, literature &mdash; all were
  possible as long as slavery endured. But when slavery began to crumble, when an ever
  larger section of the patricians, the nobility, and other free people all lived off the
  labor of the slaves, rebellions took hold. Rome's might was possible only as long as
  slave rebellions could be contained, only as long as the slave system did not
  disintegrate.</p>

  <p>For the U.S. empire, the Los Angeles insurrection has sounded the alarm bell.
  Although repressed with unmitigated force with daily scurrilous attacks by a kept press
  which is free only to lie and to slander, the insurrection nevertheless lives on.</p>

  <p>While the ruling class maintains a serene public face, this uprising has changed the
  agenda of their inner councils. They are now far more preoccupied with domestic
  affairs. International questions have been shoved way into the background.</p>

  <p>Rarely has there been such an illustrious example of the relation between foreign
  and domestic politics. For foreign policy has been ever more an extension of domestic
  policy. Except in the historiography of the bourgeoisie, domestic politics always seem
  to be merely a reflection of quarrels within the ruling class. They appear to be
  affairs exclusively in the domain of the exploiters, involving the share of booty each
  would derive from the sweat and blood of the exploited.</p>

  <p>But the rebellion adds a new dimension to the statement that foreign policy is an
  extension of the domestic struggle between the oppressors and oppressed, not just the
  struggle among the oppressors.</p>

  <p>The Iraqi government swiftly caught the significance of the rebellious masses and
  their merciless repression by the combined forces of city, state and federal
  government. Iraq introduced in the UN Security Council a complaint against the U.S. for
  violation of human rights.</p>

  <p>In doing so, Iraq rose from the humbled to the humbler, to the delight of the vast
  majority of the human race and even to many on the council itself. The Security Council
  had to accept the complaint, and even the U.S. delegate could not oppose it.</p>

  <p><strong>'We have problems at home'</strong></p>

  <p>None of this is altogether new. In the post-World War II period Walter Lippman was
  regarded by many in the capitalist establishment as the foremost writer articulating
  U.S. foreign policy. He could thereby also act as occasional critic. Lippman understood
  the foreign policy implications of the Watts rebellion of 1965.</p>

  <p>After writing for more than two decades in the <em>New York Herald Tribune</em>
  exclusively on foreign affairs, Lippman was forced to publicly proclaim, "We now have
  problems at home. Our attention has to be drawn in that direction."</p>

  <p>During the Johnson administration, there is no question that they attempted, through
  the projects known as the Great Society, to alleviate some of the most onerous and
  grossly discriminatory practices in order to better prosecute the Vietnam war at a time
  when the capitalist economy was rising. But no fundamental alteration in the general
  conditions for Black people took hold.</p>

  <p><strong>Executive, police power strengthened</strong></p>

  <p>The insurrection demonstrates to the hilt where the development of the governmental
  apparatus of the city administration of Los Angeles is going. As in the state and
  federal governments, the tendency is toward increased centralization, moving power away
  from the legislative branch and into the executive. The mayor's office &mdash; the
  executive branch &mdash; grows stronger and power shifts in time of crisis to the
  police and military.</p>

  <p>The city council of Los Angeles has 15 members. Three are Black, three Latino and
  one Asian. Thus city council members from oppressed peoples constitute a formidable
  minority. Yet in times of a real crisis, the city council, even with such a heavy
  minority bloc, turns out to be utterly impotent. Scarcely any members give voice to the
  oppression of the people. Should any do so, the capitalist media barely take
  notice.</p>

  <p>In every major city in the United States there has been a slow but undeviating
  tendency for the police power to grow stronger, as the legislative branch grows weaker.
  More power is arrogated to the executive branch, which in turn strengthens the police
  power. This tendency is also evidenced in most European capital cities, but it is
  especially accentuated in the principal cities of the United States.</p>

  <p>It's no accident that in cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Los
  Angeles and San Francisco, the police and military forces of the cities grow while the
  legislative branches become mere talking shops. In times of crisis they fall into a
  complete torpor. And the mayor handily invokes emergency powers that in turn authorize
  the police to virtually act as an army of occupation.</p>

  <p><strong>They should have seen it coming</strong></p>

  <p>If in the weeks and months before the insurrection there was anyone who had an
  inkling of what was coming, it was the <em>Los Angeles Times.</em> This paper is the
  principal mouthpiece of the big-business community in California and one with a
  sprinkling of liberalism.</p>

  <p>It dispatched staff writers Charisse Jones and Hector Tobar to live next door to
  each other for a month on the 900 block of West 53rd Street of South Central Los
  Angeles. There, said the <em>Times,</em> great changes were in full swing.</p>

  <p>Jones reported on the experiences of Black people, while Tobar explored life for the
  neighborhood's Latinos. Their findings were published in the Feb. 16 and 17 <em>Los
  Angeles Times.</em></p>

  <p>The article on Feb. 16 purports to analyze a massive shift in population that had
  altered what it calls the area's urban landscape with new residents, Latinos. There are
  vivid descriptions of individual Latino households explaining how and why they migrated
  in such huge numbers to this area.</p>

  <p>In recent years, it says, thousands of Latino immigrants had moved to West 53rd
  Street and its surrounding blocks, profoundly transforming the area's character.</p>

  <p>"In little more than a decade, what was once the largest Black community in the
  western U.S. has become one of the nation's fastest growing Latino communities. By the
  turn of the century, experts say, Latinos will outnumber African Americans in South Los
  Angeles," said the <em>Times.</em></p>

  <p>A certain Reina Maldonado, resident of 53rd Street, said, "When we first came here,
  it was almost all Black people. Pretty soon it will be all Latino. And then you wonder
  who will be next to replace us. The Asians?"</p>

  <p>The <em>Times</em> continues, "As the area's Black population slowly disappears
  there is a feeling among some of the newly arrived Latinos of being pioneers and of
  creating something new."</p>

  <p><strong>'Black community disappears'</strong></p>

  <p>In the Feb. 17 edition, written by Charisse Jones, is basically the sad story of the
  Black residents whose community is slowly disappearing. It is obvious the reporters
  made an intensive study which demonstrated the massive shift of Latinos and the
  declining Black population. Despite this intensive effort, the result is superficial if
  not hollow.</p>

  <p>The articles might have rung an alarm bell of the deteriorating economic situation.
  They might have warned of the oppressive character of the city and state governments,
  and most of all the police.</p>

  <p>But not a word of this appeared in this very elaborate study. All one sees is a
  massive shift of population. Is that in and of itself the fundamental cause of the
  insurrection? Or is it the frustration arising from the monstrous repression by the
  police, the city government, and the state? Not a word of this is in the study.</p>

  <p>There is nothing in the <em>Times'</em> articles on the economic situation of the
  Black people. How many are employed, unemployed, partly employed. How many middle class
  Black people are there. What are they doing?</p>

  <p>Only after the rebellion, on May 11, does the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> condescend
  to inform its readers that Census Bureau figures of 1990 show that the income,
  employment and education of South Los Angeles fell below the city and county averages.
  In some cases the area was even below its level in 1965.</p>

  <p>At 30 percent, the 1990 poverty rate for households in South Los Angeles was twice
  the rate for the city overall. That figure was nearly three times the national rate of
  11 percent. It was also higher than during the 1965 Watts rebellion, when 27 percent of
  the area's households lived in poverty.</p>

  <p>All this information was available after the 1990 census to city, state and federal
  governments. But they paid no attention.</p>

  <p><strong>Who are the criminal few?</strong></p>

  <p>Equally guilty is the kind of reporting done in the May 18 <em>Newsweek,</em> where
  we find that a small group of the "underclass" rioted and devastated the area while 30
  million African Americans stayed home as orderly law-abiding citizens. What a shameful
  fraud. What a lie.</p>

  <p>It was exactly in this language that the reactionary writers and publicists for the
  absolutist monarchy described those who attacked the Bastille in the French Revolution
  and contrasted them to "the vast majority of law-abiding citizens."</p>

  <p>It counterpoises what it calls a small criminal group to the vast majority. But the
  real small criminal group is the millionaires and billionaires who are not at all
  orderly and law abiding but who rob, cheat, deceive and will use any artifice to
  maintain their superabundance of wealth and power and pursue the extraction of

  <p><strong>Insurrections throughout history</strong></p>

  <p>It is impossible to understand the nature and impact of the Los Angeles insurrection
  unless one considers that it is one of more than 200 rebellions reaching back to the
  days of slavery. Reporters Jones and Tobar try to divorce this relatively small
  community from the chain of historical evolution in the Black liberation struggle. This
  is impossible.</p>

  <p>Just alluding to the 1965 Watts insurrection or the ones in Detroit, Newark and
  elsewhere is still inadequate. For a full-rounded exposition of the nature of the
  struggle, one has to view it in terms of class and national oppression. It is both a
  national liberation movement &mdash; a national struggle, to use the Leninist term
  &mdash; and a class struggle against capitalist exploitation and imperialist
  oppression.</p>

  <p>Without seeing this dual character of the struggle, one inevitably falls into the
  trap of confining it to petty reforms and patchwork solutions. Moreover, the white
  workers must fully awaken to their responsibilities. Otherwise, they will sink ever
  lower and absorb more of the blows of capitalist oppression and exploitation, adding to
  the problems rather than becoming, together with the Black, Latino and other oppressed
  people, part of the solution.</p>
