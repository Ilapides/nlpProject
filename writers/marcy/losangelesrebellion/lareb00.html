  <h5>A Marxist Defense of the LA Rebellion [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>This pamphlet consists of three articles by Sam Marcy that originally appeared in
  <em>Workers World</em> newspaper. The two that appear first were written after the Los
  Angeles rebellion of 1992. The third was written nearly a quarter century earlier, and
  appeared on the heels of the many uprisings all across the country sparked by the
  assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, in 1968.</p>

  <p>The situation of African American people in the United States has in many ways
  deteriorated since then. The political and economic gains won precisely out of the
  militant struggles of the 1960s have been so deeply eroded that &mdash; as Marcy points
  out &mdash; the poverty rate is higher in South Los Angeles today than it was in Watts
  in 1965.</p>

  <p>The rebellion in Los Angeles was touched off by the racist verdict in the Rodney
  King beating case, but it elicited sympathy and participation from other oppressed
  communities. Across the country, Latinos, lesbians and gays, poor whites - millions of
  people denied justice and dignity by the racist, sexist, homophobic ruling class - saw
  immediately that the rebellion was justified.</p>

  <p>These articles defend the spontaneous revolutionary action of the masses against the
  monstrous repressive apparatus of the state. At the same time, Marcy points out that
  "No viable class or nation in modern capitalist society can hope to take destiny in its
  own hands by spontaneous struggles alone. Spontaneity as an element of social struggle
  must beget its own opposite: leadership and organization."</p>

  <p>Sam Marcy has spent his life as an organizer and writer working to revive the
  revolutionary essence of Marxism, both as a tool of social, political and economic
  analysis and as a weapon of struggle. His published books include: <em>Perestroika: A
  Marxist Critique; High Tech, Low Pay &mdash; A Marxist Analysis of the Changing
  Character of the Working Class;</em> and <em>The Bolsheviks and War &mdash; Lessons for
  Today's Anti-War Movement.</em> Pamphlets by Marcy include: <em>The Klan and the
  Government &mdash; Foes or Allies; Anatomy of the Economic Crisis; Generals over the
  White House: The Impact of the Military-Industrial Complex; Poland &mdash; Behind the
  Crisis;</em> and <em>China &mdash; The Struggle Within.</em></p>
