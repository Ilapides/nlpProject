  <h5>Czechoslovakia 1968: The Class Character of the Events [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>III. After the Warsaw Pact intervention</h1>

  <h3>Intervention Statement</h3>

  <p>NEW YORK, August 22, 1968 &mdash; Sam Marcy, chairman of Workers World Party,
  announced the organization's support of the Warsaw Pact nations' intervention into
  Czechoslovakia today and made the following statement to the press:</p>

  <blockquote>
    The worst possible thing that could happen in Czechoslovakia would be the triumph of
    the counter-revolution and the restoration of capitalism. This would inevitably mean
    open or covert domination by U.S. imperialism and for the masses a return to the
    slavery of the past.

    <p>The victory of the counter-revolution in Czechoslovakia would encourage all the
    counter-revolutionary elements of Eastern Europe and those in the Soviet Union as
    well. It would place in doubt the very existence of the socialist countries,
    including the Soviet Union, where the forces of reaction were most recently evidenced
    by the reactionary thesis of Professor Sakharov, who is supported by the same
    elements who sponsored the Czech counter-revolution.</p>

    <p>We would prefer a revival of Leninism in Czechoslovakia and a return to the road
    of genuine communism, full and complete. But there is no existing revolutionary
    alternative to the present contending forces in that country.</p>

    <p>We do not support the political policies of the Soviet revisionists, because they
    themselves are responsible for unleashing many of the restorationist forces. But as
    against the bourgeois counter-revolution, we support the Warsaw Pact intervention
    under present circumstances.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Counter-revolution, not "reform"</h3>

  <p>August 22, 1968 &mdash; In evaluating the intervention of Warsaw Pact troops in
  Czechoslovakia on August 21, it is first necessary to evaluate the situation that led
  to it. Under the smokescreen of "reform," and to the accompaniment of cheers from the
  "democratic" imperialists of the West, a counter-revolution has been taking place in
  that country for at least eight months.</p>

  <p>The political basis for restoring the inequalities of the past, speeding up the
  workers and making organic ties with capitalist countries was laid by the victory of
  the group led by Alexander Dubcek last January. The economic basis was laid three
  months later by the proposal to reintroduce the capitalist market particularly the
  repenetration of the world market into the Czech economy by surrendering the socialist
  state monopoly of foreign trade and simultaneously inviting foreign monopoly
  corporations to join in exploiting the Czechoslovak workers.</p>

  <p>The profits and privileges of a new capitalist aristocracy such as that of the
  United States (but on a junior level) were in the offing. The World Bank and
  International Monetary Fund (both controlled by the U.S.) were approached by the Czech
  "reformers." New pacts, some of them still secret, were being negotiated with the U.S.
  satellite, West Germany, an imperialist state which has never given up its drive to
  subjugate socialist East Germany and take over the economy of Czechoslovakia, too,
  along with the rest of East Europe. (It was the dynamic capitalist economy of German
  imperialism that set Hitler on the road to war, and the same imperialism, minus Hitler,
  is now attempting to do the same thing "peacefully.")</p>

  <p>This has all taken place under the leadership of Alexander Dubcek, who replaced
  Antonin Novotny as First Secretary of the Communist Party in January, although the
  tendencies toward capitalist restoration had already existed for years.</p>

  <p>The Dubcek group must be described as capitalist restorationist, while the Novotny
  group, in spite of its revisionist character and its undoubted mismanagement of the
  economy, was the leadership of a workers' state, with its social roots in the
  nationalized economy.</p>

  <p><strong>Social forces</strong></p>

  <p>The movement toward imperialism is unfortunately a mighty one. The plots of
  capitalist restoration are not mere cloak-and-dagger affairs. They are not restricted
  to CIA agents and Czech Nazis, even though such gentlemen do play an important role.
  They are not primarily the actions of little groups of faceless men, but the
  reassertion of broad capitalist tendencies (which are international) in the workers'
  state and their legitimization by a new group which has usurped political power.</p>

  <p>This group is the political expression of thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of
  middle class individuals (who have hundreds of thousands of friends and supporters)
  striving to increase their privileges at the expense of the masses. Since these are the
  people who are radio announcers, reporters, teachers, lawyers, etc., as well as
  engineers and administrators, they, as the repositories of Czechoslovak culture, can
  easily appear to speak in the name of the whole Czechoslovak nation.</p>

  <p>(Without the intercession of imperialism and the pressures of the world capitalist
  market, this group would have been helpless, however.)</p>

  <p>The workers, less articulate, not yet raised to full socialist consciousness &mdash;
  although it was they who made the 1948 revolution in the first place &mdash; have not
  been able to find their own independent class role in the difficult situation. The
  misleadership of the past, the falsely posed national question of the present, combine
  to confuse the workers, and may even force some of them to accept the leadership of the
  restorationists.</p>

  <p>The restorationists want to legalize their stolen privileges and increase them. They
  have neither the patience, the faith in the abundance of world socialism, nor the will
  to world revolution required for middle class loyalty to the workers' state. A genuine,
  popular revolutionary workers' leadership would have held them in line, at least to a
  very great extent. But as matters stood, they not only got out of line, they took over
  the government.</p>

  <p>With the aid of the capitalist West, they all but completed a "cold"
  counter-revolution and laid the political basis for a restoration of capitalism, with
  all capitalism's miseries, inequalities and tendencies to war and depression.</p>

  <p><strong>Short road from liberalism to fascism</strong></p>

  <p>As in Hungary in 1956, the liberal capitalists of the United States have already
  begun to tell heart-throbbing stories about idealistic people in Czechoslovakia,
  spiritually crushed by the Warsaw Pact intervention. These stories are calculated to
  prove that the struggle is really between "liberalism" and "dictatorship."</p>

  <p>But also, as in Hungary, Czechoslovak capitalism provides a slender reed for Czech
  liberalism. Just as the right-wing Communists and the Social Democrats quickly gave way
  to the bourgeois Smallholders Party in Hungary and the latter began to step aside for
  Cardinal Mindszenty and the fascists &mdash; so Czechoslovakia would have gone, and
  would still go, under Dubcek.</p>

  <p>Capitalist liberalism needs stability first of all. It needs a more or less
  contented middle class, with a powerful and wealthy capitalist class, well able to use
  bribery on a large scale so as not to have to resort too often to police measures of
  repression.</p>

  <p>This could hardly be the case with Czechoslovakia, especially since the workers
  would become more and more restless, with layoffs, new wage policies, piece work, etc.,
  etc., and would inevitably begin actions to regain their lost rights.</p>

  <p>Czechoslovak capitalist restorationism would thus not have the liberal democratic
  embroidery that the U.S. capitalists pretend to love so much &mdash; at least not for
  very long. Its dynamic and its historical logic both point in the direction of ...
  fascism.</p>

  <p><strong>East Germany endangered</strong></p>

  <p>The German Democratic Republic, which has stood for two decades against a revival of
  imperialist Germany's expansion and against the revival of Hitlerism, has been placed
  in an extremely precarious position by the intrigues of the Czech restorationists with
  the West German imperialists. The proposed Czechoslovak recognition of West Germany and
  the increased trade and other relations with it would seriously undercut the GDR (which
  West Germany does not recognize and is trying to isolate) and greatly strengthen the
  political position of the West German capitalists over Eastern Europe in general.</p>

  <p>This is more important and more fundamental than the plots of a few revanchists for
  immediate military attack against Czechoslovakia. It is reason for serious alarm about
  the future military and political situation of the Warsaw Pact countries and is one of
  the most pressing causes for their present military intervention.</p>

  <p>The U.S. press is bleating about the Soviet Army entering Prague and is making the
  false parallel of Munich, 1938, and Hitler's subsequent invasion of Czechoslovakia. To
  do this, it has to cover up the fact that it is precisely Hitler's former backers who
  are now in the process (along with U.S. big business) of trying to make an economic
  colony out of Czechoslovakia all over again!</p>

  <p>In turning their backs on East Germany and welcoming West Germany into their
  country, the Czech restorationists were in fact as conciliatory to the present German
  imperialists as many of their bourgeois parents were to Hitler in 1918. This is
  perfectly well understood in Washington. But since U.S. 1918. This is perfectly well
  understood in Washington. But since U.S. imperialism has been building up the German
  neo-Nazis as a bulwark against the Soviet Union (in spite of all their talk about
  "coexistence"), such a policy on Prague's part is highly desirable in Washington.</p>

  <p>The Czech restorationists thus endangered the actual existence of the German
  Democratic Republic and seriously weakened the whole East European bulwark against the
  imperialist West.</p>

  <p>There are now cries of outrage from the slaughterers of Vietnamese peasants against
  the armed intervention by the Warsaw Pact countries. The outrage is largely because
  their neo-Nazi junior partners have had a setback.</p>

  <p><strong>Washington's role</strong></p>

  <p>The role of U.S. money, capital, culture and diplomacy in Eastern Europe has been
  far greater than that of West Germany, although it is the latter country that may
  profit more directly and economically, at least for the moment, from counter-revolution
  in Czechoslovakia.</p>

  <p>At one time, when Czechoslovakia was truly revolutionary, the U.S. put a tight
  economic noose around it and led an international boycott campaign against it. The U.S.
  bankers also froze Czechoslovakian funds which were in the United States at the time of
  the February 1948 workers' revolution. But during the present counter-revolution all
  kinds of financial assistance are openly discussed.</p>

  <p>For the past year or so, the popular phrase in Washington has been "building bridges
  to the East." This is a favorite slogan of the strongly anti-communist Johnson himself.
  The slogan does not refer to coexistence as such, but to imperialist economic
  penetration of Eastern Europe in particular. The idea of unfreezing the Czech assets
  here, for example, is part of that "bridge building."</p>

  <p>Many trade items have now been taken off the "strategic" list. Discussion on loans
  and other economic aid has begun. The Voice of America has been toned down to
  de-emphasize the antagonism of social systems and put the accent on harmonious
  collaboration. Restorationist trends <strong>inside</strong> the Communist parties were
  encouraged by the more sophisticated imperialists as the best method of penetrating the
  East, instead of "liberating" it at tremendous cost.</p>

  <p>This bridge-building policy was really the European version of the new China policy
  that Fulbright tried to launch last year. The idea was to appeal to the revisionists in
  the Chinese leadership, to appeal to their hunger for privileges and profits, to wean
  them away from the genuine communism of equality &mdash; from the idea of communes,
  from the building of the socialist future.</p>

  <p>The Chinese people, led by Chairman Mao Tse-tung, defeated this campaign by means of
  the Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They aimed against privilege and profits and
  incidentally prevented the U.S.-sponsored counter-revolution.</p>

  <p>This was better and more effective than the present military intervention into
  Czechoslovakia &mdash; because it aroused the masses, clarified the issues and created
  a popular basis for continuing the historic struggle for world socialism.</p>

  <p>But the liberal bourgeoisie in the United States is especially outraged at the
  Warsaw Pact intervention because they thought they could win by infiltration and
  subversion ("building bridges") in Eastern Europe what they cannot win by force in
  Vietnam. Their present hysteria is not only a calculated new anti-Soviet campaign, but
  also a roar of pain and frustration that presages the ultimate doom of both their
  anti-popular wars and their anti-communist maneuvers.</p>

  <p><strong>"Democracy" and democracy</strong></p>

  <p>It is a monstrous lie to describe any movement that introduces inequalities in wages
  and salaries &mdash; as the present Czechoslovak "reform" movement does &mdash; as a
  movement toward democracy.</p>

  <p>Only if one accepts the U.S. imperialist definition of democracy as the right of
  billionaires to be parasites and the right of the people to slave for them can one
  consider this in any way "democratic."</p>

  <p>It is true that the Czech newspapers have been "free" to attack the Soviet Union,
  and intellectuals have been "free" to demand more Western culture and less sacrifice
  for the socialist allies and for countries struggling for their liberation.</p>

  <p>But there has been little freedom to advocate more socialism, more hostility to U.S.
  imperialism, more material aid for Vietnam, more workers in the universities, or more
  intellectuals in the factories. On the contrary, there is a lynch campaign against
  anyone who advocates such things in Czechoslovakia.</p>

  <p>Of course, genuine democratic reforms are always in order. But the kind of reforms
  that U.S. imperialism applauds in Czechoslovakia as democratic are hardly the kind that
  would thrill genuine revolutionaries. The democracy of the oppressed differs from the
  democracy of the oppressor as a Black freedom fighter differs from a cop.</p>

  <p>Proletarian democracy is not only desirable; it is mandatory &mdash; for the
  accomplishment of the socialist transformation of humanity. And it cannot be said that
  proletarian democracy prevailed or flourished to any great degree under the previous
  Czechoslovak regime. The point, however, is that the tendency of the Dubcek
  counter-revolutionaries was and is <strong>away from proletarian democracy,</strong>
  not toward it.</p>

  <p>There is no such thing as abstract democracy for all classes, and there never was.
  It is true that in the cracks and crevices of bourgeois democracy the proletariat may
  by diligent and heroic efforts occasionally express its own point of view. But as soon
  as it oversteps the bounds of safety for the rule of the master class, such "democracy"
  is always abrogated &mdash; by the police, the National Guard, the clamping down of
  martial law, or in extreme cases, a military dictatorship.</p>

  <p>The word "democracy" is well understood in the United States (except by the more
  gullible of middle-class intellectuals) to be a synonym for American capitalism and The
  American Way of Life. And in that sense it is indeed democracy that has been coming to
  Czechoslovakia. That is why Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and the most extreme
  right-wing reactionaries are overjoyed about it.</p>

  <p>Only the unrelenting prosecution of the proletarian revolution and the world
  conquest of power by the proletariat will, by abolishing imperialism, root and branch,
  institute the true democracy of the masses' unhampered rule, and the true freedom of
  women and men to do what they want without doing harm to their neighbor.</p>

  <p>In the meantime it is not a question of democracy in Czechoslovakia at all. And only
  dupes and liars can say it is. It is a question of which class is going to prevail, and
  it is a question of which social direction Eastern Europe will take in the immediate
  future. The situation in Czechoslovakia is temporary and episodic, with the fundamental
  classes and basic antagonists only battling in the form of indirect agents, so to
  speak. But their identity is quite clear upon closer inspection. One only needs to know
  the difference between capitalism and socialism, between oppressor and oppressed, to
  understand that Dubcek was really leading the capitalist counter-revolution.</p>

  <h2>Castro for Warsaw Pact intervention</h2>

  <p>August 23, 1968 &mdash; <small><strong>Excerpts from Cuban Premier Castro's speech
  in defense of Warsaw Pact intervention in Czechoslovakia are given below. In his
  speech, Premier Castro criticized the Soviet leadership for not giving more aid to
  defeat the counter-revolution &mdash; in other countries as well as Czechoslovakia. But
  he did not, as some social democrats contend, give merely "critical support" to the
  action of the Red Armies.</strong></small></p>

  <p>Right here, I wish to make the first important affirmation: we considered that
  Czechoslovakia was moving toward a counter-revolutionary situation. Toward capitalism
  and into the arms of imperialism.</p>

  <p>So this defines our first position in relation to the specific fact of the action
  taken by a group of socialist countries. That is, we consider that it was absolutely
  necessary, at all cost, in one way or another, to prevent this eventuality from taking
  place. ...</p>

  <p>Discussion of the form is not, in the final analysis, the most fundamental factor.
  The essential point to be accepted, or not accepted, is whether or not the socialist
  camp could allow a political situation to develop which would lead to the breaking away
  of a socialist country, to its falling into the arms of imperialism. And our point of
  view is that it is not permissible and that the socialist camp has a right to prevent
  this in one way or another. I would like to begin by making it clear that we look upon
  this fact as an essential one. ...</p>

  <p>A real liberal fury was unleashed; a whole series of political slogans in favor of
  the formation of opposition parties began to develop, in favor of open anti-Marxist and
  anti-Leninist theses, such as the thesis that the Party should cease to play the role
  which the Party plays within socialist society and begin to play the role there of a
  guide, supervising some things but, above all, exerting a sort of spiritual leadership.
  In short, that the reins of power should cease to be in the hands of the Communist
  Party.</p>

  <p>The revision of certain fundamental postulates to the effect that a socialist regime
  is a transition regime from socialism to communism, a governmental form known as the
  dictatorship of the proletariat. This means a government where power is wielded in
  behalf of one class and against the former exploiting classes by virtue of which in a
  revolutionary process political rights, the right to carry on political activities
  &mdash; whose objective is precisely to struggle against the essence and the <em>raison
  d'etre</em> of socialism &mdash; cannot be granted to the former exploiters.</p>

  <p>A series of slogans began to be put forward and in fact certain measures were taken
  such as the establishment of the bourgeois "freedom" of the press. This means that the
  counter-revolution and the exploiters, the very enemies of socialism, were granted the
  right to speak and write freely against socialism.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, a process of seizure of the principal information media by the
  reactionary elements began to develop. As regards foreign policy, a whole series of
  slogans of open rapprochement toward capitalist concepts and theses and of
  rapprochement towards the West appeared. ...</p>

  <p>On many occasions the imperialists have publicly stated what their policy is in
  relation to the socialist countries of Eastern Europe. And in Congress, in the press,
  they always talk about encouraging the liberal tendencies and even about promoting, of
  making available, some selective economic aid and of using every means of contributing
  to creating an opposition to socialism there. The imperialists are carrying out a
  campaign, not only in Czechoslovakia, but in all the countries of Eastern Europe, even
  in the Soviet Union.</p>
