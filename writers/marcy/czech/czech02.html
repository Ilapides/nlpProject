  <h1>II. Czech leaders open door to counter-revolution</h1>

  <h3>Some hard facts about Czechoslovak "reform"</h3>

  <p><em>Aim is to dismantle socialist economy, turn to West: fruits of Soviet
  revisionism.</em></p>

  <p><em>By Sam Marcy</em></p>

  <p>JULY 31, 1968 &mdash; This article is being written while the talks between the
  Soviet and Czech leaders are still in progress. Regardless of the outcome of these
  talks, it is plain that a counter-revolutionary turning point in Czechoslovakia has
  been reached. Only the speedy and determined intervention of the Czechoslovak working
  class can reverse this process. Unfortunately, this seems to be very unlikely at the
  present because the very leadership presently at the head of the workers has done most
  to accelerate the process of bourgeois restoration in Czechoslovakia. This took root a
  long time ago.</p>

  <p>It was the January meeting of the Czechoslovak CP leadership that brought everything
  to a head. Very little has come out in the way of detail of what happened at the
  meeting except that Novotny, himself a moderate revisionist, was replaced by Dubcek, a
  more extreme revisionist.</p>

  <p>At first it seemed only a change in degree, a substituting for an old-line
  revisionist one that would take one or two more steps in the process of bourgeois
  restoration. What happened since January, however, is that a virtual political
  counter-revolution seems to have culminated which goes far beyond almost anything seen
  in Eastern Europe, with the possible exception of Yugoslavia. If matters continue the
  way they are proceeding right now, Czechoslovakia may move farther in the direction of
  capitalist restoration than even Yugoslavia.</p>

  <p>Under the mask of "liberalization" and "democratization," the Dubcek leadership has
  taken giant steps to dismantle the socialist basis of the economy, has widened and
  deepened the capitalist "free market" in the country, has indiscriminately generalized
  material incentives to the upper, privileged layers of the population and has in effect
  substituted bourgeois economic methods of distributing national income for what were
  strong socialist economic beginnings. The capitalist market is now to be the
  <strong>primary</strong> lever in running the economy and the socialization of industry
  and centralized planning is to be subordinated to it if not abolished. This is not said
  in so many words, but that is the direction in which events are moving, and they are
  moving fast.</p>

  <p><strong>'Experiment' a cover-up for restoration</strong></p>

  <p>Much of this has to be covered up by assurances that it is "only an experiment,"
  that the new leaders are merely "innovating," that they are trying "creative methods,"
  trying to use imagination instead of sticking to old dogma and so on and so forth. But
  this is merely a cover-up to transform the basic features of the economic system.</p>

  <p>The Cubans too are interested in imaginative ideas, in new methods, and in
  discarding old dogmas which hinder the development of socialist construction and
  release the creative energies of the masses. So are the north Koreans, the Vietnamese,
  the Albanians, the Chinese and the East Germans. It is strange that the world
  bourgeoisie should not praise them and welcome them with open arms the way they do the
  Czechoslovaks.</p>

  <p>True, there is still public ownership of the basic means of production in
  Czechoslovakia. But all or almost all of the political power is now in the hands of a
  <strong>bourgeois</strong> intelligentsia which is bent on dismantling the whole system
  built by the working class since 1948, when power was seized from the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Not only are almost all the organs of political power strongly oriented toward the
  Western type of capitalist economy, but they are in constant and irreconcilable
  struggle with the socialized sector of the economy &mdash; that is, with the basic
  industries such as steel, iron, power generating, chemical and engineering industries,
  which are still legally owned by the state and were developed by the sweat and blood of
  the workers into the strongest pillars of a socialized economy.</p>

  <p>However, the whole struggle of the bourgeois intelligentsia, especially the
  technical intelligentsia, is to sabotage the further socialist growth and development
  of the basic means of production and to slowly dismantle them, fragment by fragment,
  using one deceptive device after another to fool the workers. The complaints of the
  so-called reformers that they have to return to capitalist free enterprise in order to
  reverse the disproportion between heavy industry and light (consumer) industry is
  nonsense. The entire Western bourgeoisie would not have become cheerleader to the
  Dubcek regime on that account alone.</p>

  <p><strong>What caused the economic crisis?</strong></p>

  <p>This has inevitably brought on an acute economic crisis. Nothing has so vividly and
  graphically pointed up the character of the crisis as the admission by the new regime
  on July 26th that the country faces a "grave <strong>economic disequilibrium"</strong>
  (<em>New York Times,</em> July 28, 1968). This is a fancy word for a full-scale
  economic crisis.</p>

  <p>What is the cause of the so-called <strong>"economic disequilibrium?"</strong> The
  cause lies squarely in the efforts of the bourgeois intelligentsia and its political
  tool, the Dubcek leadership, to wreck the socialized economy. Having done it only
  half-way has created confusion and chaos, but has not hidden the hand of the
  saboteurs.</p>

  <p>The cause of the <strong>"economic disequilibrium,"</strong> as they call it, is
  utterly unlike any of the economic crises which plague the Western capitalist system.
  These, as is well known, are caused by overproduction due to private ownership of the
  means of production, and producing for private profit in a blind market rather than
  public need. The economic crisis in Czechoslovakia which the new leadership was forced
  to admit exists is an artificial one, a so-called "man made" economic crisis, a crisis
  which does not grow out of the automatic processes inherent in the system, as is the
  case in a capitalist economy, but an economic crisis that has its roots in a gradual
  take-over by the bourgeois intelligentsia and in their attempt to re-orient the economy
  to bourgeois market relations.</p>

  <p>Just as a workers' government after it seizes power encounters great difficulties in
  re-orienting toward a socialist economy, in the same way the new restorationist
  leadership in Prague is facing an economic crisis in attempting the economic transition
  from socialism to capitalism.</p>

  <p>The difference is, however, that while the difficulties experienced in the formation
  of a socialist system are mere birth pangs, the transformation of an incipient
  socialist system into a capitalist system means an eventual return to economic chaos
  and imperialist enslavement.</p>

  <p>It is no wonder then that the Dubcek regime was forced to admit in the official
  economic report for the first six months of 1968 that the rate of economic growth
  during the past half year, that is, the half year that began with his January political
  coup at the Central Committee meeting, was slower than either the entire year of 1967
  or 1966. And that probably is a gross understatement! 1966. And that probably is a
  gross understatement!</p>

  <p>The economic report also admits the "existence of strong inflationary pressures" and
  that "many consumer goods are entirely unavailable." Even while the Dubcek leadership
  was meeting with the Soviet leaders, the economic ministry was forced to announce price
  increases on consumer goods. The economic situation created by the mismanagement of the
  new governing group must indeed be critical if they had to announce it at this
  particular moment.</p>

  <p>The economic chaos caused by the swiftly developing political counter-revolution has
  put in total jeopardy the basic gains of socialist construction in Czechoslovakia.</p>

  <p>There is no freedom for genuine revolutionaries to sound the alarm and arouse the
  workers through the public press of Czechoslovakia. Nor is there any room in the press
  of Czechoslovakia to expose the counter-revolutionary character of the so-called
  economic reforms or to engage the political leaders in a genuine debate over the new
  road which they have embarked upon. But there is plenty of room, plenty of freedom, to
  deride Marxism, to paint up the face of Western imperialism, to cozy up to the neo-Nazi
  regime of West Germany, to attack the German Democratic Republic and, it goes without
  saying, to rehabilitate the symbols of old capitalist Czechoslovakia: Masaryk, Benes
  &amp; Co.</p>

  <p>Of course, because the <strong>political</strong> counter-revolution has not yet
  succeeded in bringing about the full <strong>social</strong> and
  <strong>economic</strong> counterrevolution, the full capitalist restoration has not
  yet been really effected. That is to say, the restorationists are in the seats of
  political power, but while the property relations are being reversed, they have not yet
  been fully reversed. It is possible that there might be a temporary leftward reversal
  under pressure from the Soviet Union and its allies. However, only the revolutionary
  intervention of the Czech workers from below will bring about any fundamental changes
  of a truly progressive character.</p>

  <p><strong>Role of Soviet bureaucracy</strong></p>

  <p>Any analysis that bases itself exclusively on the internal forces in Czechoslovakia
  without taking into account the role of the Soviet liquidators of Marxism would be
  completely false and one-sided. It is scarcely possible to believe that the tragic
  events which are now unfolding in Czechoslovakia would be taking place were it not for
  the fact that the Soviet leadership is, in the main, responsible for these very events.
  It is the Soviet bureaucracy which abandoned Marxist-Leninist principles in the first
  place and began not only to encourage but to demand a revisionist course in politics
  and economics from its socialist allies. What has happened is that the Czechoslovak
  events have gone far beyond what is even safe for the Soviet bureaucracy itself.</p>

  <p>The difference between the Czech "reformers" and the Soviet bureaucracy is that the
  latter is deeply rooted in socialized production, whereas the former are a combination
  of the old bourgeois intelligentsia and elements of the new technical bureaucracy that
  have no great stake in the socialized economy. They are akin to the old Czarist
  intelligentsia that was engrafted upon the new Soviet regime, but later superseded.</p>

  <p>The very same reactionary forces which have reared their head in Czechoslovakia and
  are now confidently marching on the political stage there, are also slowly rising to
  the surface in the Soviet Union. These forces are a powerful current in the Soviet
  Union and the bureaucracy has encouraged and nourished them. As in Czechoslovakia only
  the mass intervention on a truly historic scale of the revolutionary working class can
  stop the creeping counter-revolution. Only the working class, by taking destiny into
  its own hands, can sweep it away.</p>

  <h2>Hard facts about Czechoslovak "reform"</h2>

  <p>August 1, 1968 &mdash; The quotations and paraphrases given below should supply a
  factual picture of what the Czechoslovakian reform movement is all about. The only
  subject that is left out of this survey is that of "democracy" and "freedom," as such.
  But the material here should give a guideline of concrete facts showing who will
  benefit and who will suffer from the kind of freedom and democracy the Czech reformers
  have in mind.</p>

  <p><em><span class="c1">Equality</span></em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>It is not possible to permanently blunt economic policy by taking from
    those who work well and giving to those who work badly. Therefore it is necessary to
    objectivize value relations so that differences in the income situation among
    enterprises express the real differences in the standard of their work.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Democratization of the economy includes in particular the realization of
    the independence of enterprises and enterprise groupings and their relative
    independence of state bodies ... the right and real possibility of different groups
    of working people and different social groups to formulate and defend their economic
    interests in creating the economic policy.</strong></p>

    <hr class="c2" size="2" width="60%" />

    <p><strong>Ota Sik (deputy premier) urged the creation of a realistic price system
    based on the market, and an end to wage practices that made Czechoslovakia one of the
    world's most egalitarian nations &mdash; and led to absurdities such that a taxi
    driver made more money than an architect or a doctor, and workers more than
    managers.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>During 1965, the average pay of administrative employees was only 64.3
    percent of workers' pay, whereas salaries of engineers and technicians were only 30
    percent higher than workers' pay. (This was in the form of a complaint that the
    reform movement is now answering.)</strong></p>

      <li><em>Techniky Tydenik,</em> Prague, August 1966</li>

    <hr class="c2" size="2" width="60%" />

    <p><strong>One of the most frequent opinions concerning the</strong> de-leveling
    <strong>campaign</strong> (initiated by the "reformers") <strong>has been the
    conviction</strong> (of the workers) <strong>that "one gives raises to the
    higher-ups, whereas the workers are left out"</strong> (Our emphasis).</p>

      <li><em>Rude Pravo,</em> July 20, 1967</li>
    </ul>
    <hr class="c2" size="2" width="60%" />

    <p><strong>Since 1966, the average salaries of engineers and technicians increased by
    5.2 percent, those of administrative employees by 6.2 percent, whereas wages of
    workers rose by only 1.4 percent.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>They want a much sharper differentiation in wages. They realize that
    inefficient firms will suffer. ... A high official in the Ministry of Foreign Trade
    avowed that "a little unemployment would be a good thing."</strong></p>

    </ul>
    <hr class="c2" size="2" width="60%" />

    <p><strong>From the point of view of the workers, the economic reform seems to be
    yielding quick payoffs mainly to their superiors while the prospect of ultimate
    benefits for workers appears remote. Workers have, of course, failed to respond to
    the deleveling proposals with much enthusiasm.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>One year ago, Prague was telling Western diplomats: "You will be able to
    meet your colleagues from West Germany in Prague when in your capital we can meet our
    colleagues from East Germany." But Prague is no longer so solicitous of the interests
    of East Germany. Last year Czechoslovakia stressed that imminent exchange with West
    German trade missions would not in itself stimulate the evolution of political ties.
    But Cernik, now Prime Minister, stated after the arrival in Prague of the Bonn
    representative that the exchange of trade missions represents "an important step
    toward the normalization of relations."</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The new Czech leaders wish to make moves in concert with other "small
    Powers" of Europe, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries.
    They will, it will soon become clear, be less eager to aid revolutionary forces and
    regimes in the Third World. The feeling is strong that the burden has been more than
    the Czech economy can bear. The fruits, notably in the Cuban case, have been
    disappointing.</strong></p>
