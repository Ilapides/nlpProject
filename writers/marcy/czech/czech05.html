  <h1>V. The Myth of 'Peaceful Coexistence'</h1>

  <p><em>By Sam Marcy</em></p>

  <p>DECEMBER 6, 1968 &mdash; It is now more than three months since the Warsaw Pact
  nations intervened in Czechoslovakia. Even if no substantial or abiding change in the
  internal situation of that country has occurred, it has at least stopped the
  counter-revolution in its tracks. Its international effects, which have only begun to
  sink in, are truly enormous.</p>

  <p>We merely have to take a glance at the world scene today and it becomes apparent at
  once that there has taken place a radical alteration in the attitude of the world
  bourgeoisie and of the U.S. ruling class toward the Soviet Union and its socialist
  allies. One only has to remind oneself how relations between the Soviet Union and the
  United States were regarded just a bare few weeks before the intervention to see how
  different things appear today.</p>

  <p>In the <em>New York Times</em> of July 8, 1968, five months ago, Harry Schwartz
  presented a definitive appraisal of Soviet-American relations over a five-year period.
  His conclusion was that cooperation between the two countries was "now so important and
  obvious that Communist dogmatists inside and outside the Soviet Union consider the
  situation a scandal."</p>

  <p>However, on November 22, the chief foreign correspondent of the same paper, C. L.
  Sulzburger, was singing a different tune. Commenting on Soviet-American relations in
  the light of Czechoslovakia and the mounting crisis in the Mideast, he found that
  "there is distinct wariness on both sides of the ideological frontier" and, what is far
  more significant, "a renewed fear of ultimate hot war."</p>

  <p><strong>Deluded imperialists thought that the counter-revolution was completely
  safe</strong></p>

  <p>So certain was Harry Schwartz in July about this lasting cooperation between the
  USSR and the USA that he did not even mention the situation in Czechoslovakia! Since
  then Czechoslovakia has become a virtual obsession with the U.S. ruling class. The
  <em>Times</em> itself felt obliged to send to Moscow, in addition to its regular
  reporters, two of its top correspondents, James Reston, the executive editor, and C. L.
  Sulzburger.</p>

  <p>When Schwartz, who is one of its top Soviet analysts, wrote his appraisal, he took
  it for granted, along with all the others, that the truly scandalous cooperation he had
  alluded to forestalled any serious move by the Soviet Union to reverse the
  counter-revolutionary trend in Eastern Europe. Of course, Schwartz, as well as the
  <em>Times,</em> was not alone in his evaluation of Soviet-American relations. Indeed,
  practically all elements of the ruling class seemed to share the same view, especially
  in Western Europe.</p>

  <p>On the basis of this evaluation they concluded that the Soviet Union would not
  intervene in Czechoslovakia and that the counterrevolution would not only continue
  unchecked in Czechoslovakia but perhaps take strong hold in the rest of Eastern Europe
  and maybe in the Soviet Union as well.</p>

  <p>Even the U.S. military, which took a more cautious view of the situation, concurred.
  For instance, R. Rockingham Gill, the Pentagon's military analyst for Eastern Europe,
  assured the Czechoslovak neo-restorationists in no uncertain terms that the chances of
  the Soviet Union intervening were minimal. (See "Czechoslovakia: Will the Soviet Army
  Intervene?" July 8, 1968, issue of <em>East Europe,</em> a CIA-State Department
  publication.)</p>

  <p>After the intervention in Czechoslovakia, it was the top cold war expert and former
  U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, George Kennan, who started beating the war drums.
  Once again he tried to give the lead in a reappraisal of U.S.-Soviet relations, as he
  had done in 1947 with his infamous "Mr. X" article in <em>Foreign Affairs</em>, in
  which he laid out a blueprint for U.S. imperialist aggression against the Soviet Union,
  its allies, and the liberation movements of the world. Only now he sounded so frantic
  and irrational in his call for the deployment of "a couple of new U.S. troop divisions
  into Western Europe" to counter the Warsaw Pact nations that he could scarcely be
  regarded as serious.</p>

  <p>While other spokesmen for the imperialist establishment were undoubtedly no less
  frantic, few could see the possibilities of immediately deploying one or more divisions
  as Kennan demanded, with the war in Vietnam going as it was and in the midst of an
  election campaign where the capitalist candidates were outdoing each other in peace
  demagogy.</p>

  <p><strong>New U.S. war moves: revival of NATO back to the days of John Foster
  Dulles</strong></p>

  <p>Nevertheless, a series of war moves engineered by the U.S. under the cover of NATO
  have made it abundantly clear that the call by the <em>New York Times</em> of September
  13 for a "long overdue updating of NATO political and military policy" had the complete
  backing of the U.S. government and its military establishment.</p>

  <p>The <em>Times</em> editorial foreshadowed the so-called warning to the Warsaw Pact
  nations issued by the NATO Council of Ministers which was held a month later on
  November 16. In a saber-rattling communique, dictated no doubt by the Pentagon, the
  Council said: "Any Soviet intervention directly or indirectly affecting the situation
  in Europe or in the Mediterranean would create an international crisis with grave
  consequences."</p>

  <p>This is a return to the kind of language that John Foster Dulles used and the kind
  of language that Gen. Lyman Lemnitzer, the NATO commander, undoubtedly insisted upon.
  Its effect is to re-assert U.S. hegemony over Europe in both the political and military
  sense and to proclaim once again that the Mediterranean is still an American lake.</p>

  <p>It is also a menacing challenge to the Arab people and is calculated to stem the
  tide of their ever-rising liberation movement. In a lesser sense, this bellicose
  pronunciamento is also calculated to shore up the rapidly fading fortunes of the
  fascist regimes of Portugal (and its beleaguered African empire), Spain and Greece.</p>

  <p>It should also be noted that the Warsaw Pact intervention has modified the character
  of the international situation even in areas which seem far removed from it. Thus, the
  recent monetary crisis in Western Europe, which reflects the sharpening struggle among
  the imperialists for markets, for new areas of exploitation, and for more intensified
  exploitation of older areas, was in part influenced by the intervention.</p>

  <p>In a sense the intervention was public notice to the imperialists that the
  Czechoslovak economy was not "up for grabs" by the imperialists, as was assumed by them
  following the January coup by the Dubcek group of neo-restorationists. Czechoslovakia
  had already been looked upon as a lucrative market. Not only the U.S., but Britain,
  West Germany, France and all the rest of the European capitalist countries eagerly
  looked forward to getting their slice of the pie. It was a project which the
  imperialists had conceived and worked upon for a long time, which was at long last to
  bear some fruit.</p>

  <p>Their severe disappointment could not but be reflected in their monetary dealings,
  which are all too frequently based on rising political anticipations, which are in
  turn, more often than not, as inflated as their currencies.</p>

  <p><strong>U.S.-USSR collaboration limited by basic irreconcilability of two social
  systems</strong></p>

  <p>The new, more aggressive stand of U.S. monopoly capitalism does not necessarily
  imply a corresponding change in the direction of revolutionary policy by the Soviet
  leadership. But it does indicate that there is a limit to the kind of collaboration
  that the Soviet leaders have accommodated themselves to for so many years in relation
  to the U.S.</p>

  <p>In particular it illustrates how far the Soviet leaders will go in the pursuit of
  the false and spurious doctrine of peaceful co-existence. They will abandon it only, it
  seems, when it becomes patently clear to at least some of the most authoritative of the
  Soviet leaders that its further pursuit will end up in the destruction of the socialist
  basis of the Soviet Union itself or, at least, become a great danger to it.</p>

  <p>That is one of the most important lessons of the Czechoslovak experience, which at
  this writing is by no means a closed book.</p>

  <p>The miscalculation of the bourgeoisie in relation to the Warsaw Pact intervention is
  based in part on the myth of the military omnipotence of the U.S., a myth which is
  slowly disintegrating under the impact of the Vietnam war. It is also based in part on
  the many years of accommodation of the Soviet leadership to the demands and threats of
  U.S. finance capital.</p>

  <p>As a consequence of this, bourgeois scholars, paid and unpaid government advisors
  and, above all, liberal and revisionist apologists for the status-quo-at-any-price
  elevated the Soviet leaders' championing of the theory of peaceful coexistence to a
  permanent and immutable feature of Soviet foreign policy, if not to an eternal
  category.</p>

  <p>The Czechoslovak experience has exploded this reactionary panacea. In their rage,
  the ideological servants of the bourgeoisie are trying to make up for their bankrupt
  theory by spewing all their venom against the Soviet Union and conjuring up an image of
  the Soviet Republic as a new imperialist monster that has now adopted the same designs
  as the old Czarist empire.</p>

  <p>In reality all that has happened is that the Czechoslovak experience has brought to
  the surface the underlying social and class antagonisms that separate the imperialist
  from the socialist countries. This has been covered up for too long a time by an
  overgrowth and predominance of bourgeois ideology, supported by the leaders of the
  Soviet Union as well as imperialist ideologists.</p>

  <p><strong>Can predatory monopolists engage in 'peaceful economic
  competition?'</strong></p>

  <p>One of the basic assumptions in the theory of peaceful co-existence which lies at
  the core of this ideology is the idea that peaceful economic competition between the
  two social systems would undermine, and maybe eventually eliminate, the imperialist
  drive towards war.</p>

  <p>"Let us compete in trade, in commerce. Let us engage in a race to build useful
  things for peaceful purposes. Let us not engage in a race for armaments!" This was a
  constant theme of Nikita Khrushchev. His friendship with Cyrus Eaton symbolized this.
  But this theory is in violent contradiction to the real-life processes which dominate
  imperialist economics.</p>

  <p>In the first place, there is no such thing as trade and commerce under imperialism
  which is divorced from its predatory politics. Its trade and commerce are completely
  interwoven and subordinate to the broad political objectives of imperialist finance
  capital. The use of terror, coercion, blackmail, duress, and even outright
  assassination to gain a purely economic (and even a narrow economic) end is part of the
  daily practice and routine of imperialist monopolies.</p>

  <p>Also it must not be forgotten that, even at this very late date in its development,
  monopoly capitalism still controls the major share of the world's resources and
  technology and exercises political hegemony (the right to exploit and super-exploit the
  majority of mankind) even at a time when the majority of mankind is in more open
  rebellion than it has ever been before in its history.</p>

  <p>This is a weighty factor if one wants to consider so-called peaceful competition
  realistically.</p>

  <p>According to proponents of the theory of the peaceful competition between the two
  social systems, the socialist system would win out because it is a superior economic
  system. Indeed, it is! But the imperialist methods of conducting economic competition
  with the socialist countries have meant not only blockading and isolating them, but
  also strangling them economically and boycotting them where possible. At all times the
  peaceful competition phase of imperialism has been a preparatory period of the military
  phase of imperialist politics.</p>

  <p><strong>The U.S. subjection of Western Europe and the lesson of
  Czechoslovakia</strong></p>

  <p>It is instructive to relate the experience of European imperialist powers with their
  benefactors and masters, the U.S. economic colossus. This experience illustrates the
  utter inability of the European monopolists to withstand the daily economic
  penetrations &mdash; a more fitting phrase would be the daily economic assault &mdash;
  against the European continent by the U.S. monopolists. In his well-documented book,
  <em>The American Challenge,</em> J.J. Servan-Schreiber shows how the continent is
  gradually becoming an economic vassal of the U.S. In the opinion of some it has long
  been one.</p>

  <p>A new book, <em>The American Takeover of Britain,</em> by James McMillan and Bernard
  Harris confirms the same trend. At this moment Servan-Schreiber and many other European
  economic analysts, scholars and specialists of all sorts are meeting in Princeton, New
  Jersey, to discuss, among other things, the American economic relations to Europe. In
  reality Servan-Schreiber and the other liberal well-wishers for a U.S.-European "good
  partnership" are in Princeton to plead with the U.S. bankers and financiers to slow the
  U.S. economic take-over of Europe. Their pleading will fall on deaf ears. It is in the
  nature of the beast to take what he can, and he is only stopped by force.</p>

  <p>The "let us compete peacefully" theory as it applied to Czechoslovakia meant in the
  final analysis opening the gates wide to the imperialist beast and his junior partners.
  That is the other lesson of the Czechoslovak experience.</p>

  <h2>Czech banker has a friend at Chase Manhattan</h2>

  <p>December 23, 1968 &mdash; What have a former director of the Czechoslovak State Bank
  and a former chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank got in common?</p>

  <p>Plenty, it seems. Both were in attendance at a seminar at Princeton last week and
  their views turned out to be remarkably similar. Dr. Eugene Loebl, who left Prague for
  the U.S. after Warsaw Pact troops halted the counter-revolution in Czechoslovakia,
  found little on which to disagree with his old friend, John J. McCloy.</p>

  <p>Loebl, who had been given life imprisonment in the early fifties under the Gottwald
  regime, was one of those who were "rehabilitated" in recent years. He was so well
  rehabilitated, in fact, that he became director of the state bank and instrumental in
  many of the economic "reforms" by which the restorationist elements hoped to hand
  Czechoslovakia back to capitalist domination.</p>

  <p>This man, who until a few months ago had immense control over the wealth created by
  Czech workers and farmers, makes no bones about his sympathies for U.S. imperialism or
  his disdain for the proletariat. "The proletariat is becoming the regressive force," he
  told a reporter for the <em>Newark Evening News</em> on Dec. 4. "Wealth is not created
  by the exploitation of men but by the exploitation of nature."</p>

  <p>The <em>Newark News</em> went on to say: "Eugene Loebl ... asserted the U.S. is
  closer to the 'ideals' of socialism."</p>

  <p>One representative of Wall Street-style socialism, Chase Manhattan's John J McCloy,
  sat at a nearby table nodding thoughtfully. McCloy tries to keep out of the news, but
  the reader may remember that he was one of the three top advisers Johnson consulted
  before resuming the bombing of North Vietnam in the winter of 1965-66. Loebl should
  find no fault with that since the "socialist" U.S. was only bombing the "regressive"
  workers of the DRV.</p>

  <p>Loebl's associations with McCloy go back to the days before he was imprisoned when
  he was lobbying to have Czechoslovakia join the Marshall Plan. The U.S. banker met
  Loebl in Washington where they drew up plans to bring Czechoslovakia into the
  multi-billion dollar program that has today turned even the proudest imperialists of
  Western Europe into satellites of the U.S.</p>

  <p>John J. McCloy, as High Commissioner of Germany, was an architect of the Marshall
  Plan and had as his specific assignment pulling Eastern Europe, and especially
  Czechoslovakia, into the U.S. orbit. The post-war plans of McCloy and his partners
  failed, at least for the time being, but Dr. Loebl's "rehabilitation" and the
  subsequent rise to power of this blatant believer in capitalism show how far the
  schemes of the U.S. big business had progressed before August 21, 1968.</p>
