  <h5>Czechoslovakia 1968: The Class Character of the Events [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Postscript</h1>

  <p>Few if any developments during the post World War II period were as deeply
  influenced by international considerations as the development of the Czechoslovak
  Socialist Republic. In Western literature, the CSR is invariably described as a product
  of the Red Army intervention at the end of the Second World War and the establishment
  of a Socialist Government there as a mere coup engineered by Moscow. Western
  imperialism, on the other hand, is cast in the role of a friendly, benevolent and
  passive observer which played no role at all on its own behalf.</p>

  <p>The tremendous role of the Soviet Army in the liberation of Czechoslovakia from the
  Hitlerite yoke can, of course, never be underestimated. Recent attempts by
  neo-restorationist Czechoslovak historians to discover, after 20 years, how the U.S.
  Eighth Army under the rabidly reactionary General Patton had contributed greatly to the
  liberation are bound to be discredited and cast aside by historians of the future as
  crude U.S. propaganda that had temporarily won a foothold in Czechoslovak academic
  circles during the so-called Dubcek reform.</p>

  <p>What is often most obscured in discussions of Czechoslovakia, especially since the
  attempted counter-revolution, is the early role of the Communist Party. It is important
  to note that the Czechoslovak Communist Party was never a small, sectarian organization
  with a narrow and restricted influence. From the very day it was founded in 1921, it
  was a strong and vital force in the country enjoying a considerable amount of mass
  influence, not only among the workers, but in other strata of the population as
  well.</p>

  <p>By the late 1920's it had established itself as the leading party of the working
  class. At no time thereafter was there a Czechoslovak government that did not have to
  reckon seriously with the Party and its influence.</p>

  <p>After the capitulation of Benes and Co, to the demands of Hitler in 1938-39, the
  Party went underground, and while it sustained some serious losses, it emerged in 1945
  as the party of the proletariat. If there is any party that can be said to have won an
  overwhelming majority of the workers to its side on the European continent at the time,
  it was the Czechoslovak Party. This highly significant factor of Czechoslovak life is
  rarely, if ever, acknowledged in Western accounts of modern Czechoslovakia.</p>

  <p>With the liberation of the country from the Nazi yoke, a real revolutionary upsurge
  developed. The crushing of the Nazi forces in the Czechoslovak area, with the help of
  the Soviet Army which was greeted everywhere in the country as a liberator, reduced the
  influence of the collaborationist bourgeoisie to minimal proportions and ripened the
  general populace for a transfer of power from the remnants of the bourgeoisie to the
  proletariat.</p>

  <p>If there was any place in Eastern Europe which beckoned for an easy transition from
  a capitalist to a socialist government in the true sense of the word, it was
  Czechoslovakia.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this is not what happened. What occurred instead was the formation of
  a capitalist coalition with Benes and Co. in the saddle but with prominent Czechoslovak
  CP leaders in the cabinet at the end of World War II. Actual class relations remained
  as of old, with the old ruling class exercising its right of private property in the
  means of production and the bourgeois order of society generally remaining the
  same.</p>

  <p>This truly extraordinary situation, where the Party and the working class could
  seize power but, instead, permitted the bourgeoisie to retain it, was not due to any
  particular weakness of the Party leadership. It arose as a consequence of the relations
  and agreements between the Soviet Union and its allies, principally the U.S. One of the
  focal points in the struggle between the Soviet Union and the U.S. arose over the
  conflicting interpretation of the Yalta Agreement.</p>

  <p>Both Washington and London kept insisting that under the terms of the Yalta
  Agreement the paragraph referring to the "establishment of democratic governments after
  the war" meant the establishment of bourgeois regimes. Nowhere was this point pressed
  more than in relation to Czechoslovakia. Stalin, who feared a break with the Western
  Allies, favored formation of coalition governments in all of Eastern Europe as a form
  of compromise with the West.</p>

  <p>However, the U.S. ruling class saw the coalition governments in Czechoslovakia,
  Poland, Rumania and elsewhere as a transitional stage to eventual socialist governments
  and no amount of compromise by Stalin on this aspect of the situation in Eastern Europe
  satisfied Washington.</p>

  <p>One of the fundamental tools of the Truman Administration to reverse the situation
  in Eastern Europe was the launching of the Marshall Plan.</p>

  <p>The principal target, so far as Eastern Europe was concerned, was Czechoslovakia.
  Once an agreement was obtained to integrate Czechoslovakia into the economic framework
  of the Marshall Plan, its political ties to the East would be of negligible importance,
  particularly if a bourgeois coalition government was at the helm. Integration into the
  Marshall Plan meant integration into the Western capitalist system and economic
  domination by the U.S.</p>

  <p>John J. McCloy, who was High Commissioner for West Germany and also a banker, was in
  charge of the Eastern European aspect of the Marshall Plan and one of its leading
  architects. It was he who began the series of both secret and public meetings with
  Czechoslovak officials, particularly the bourgeois members of the Czech cabinet in
  charge of economic affairs.</p>

  <p>The December 5, 1968, issue of the <em>New York Times</em> confirms that John J.
  McCloy had secretly met in the latter part of 1948 with the then Deputy Minister of
  Foreign Trade of Czechoslovakia, Dr. Loebl, and laid preliminary plans for
  Czechoslovakia to be admitted into the Marshall Plan Program.</p>

  <p>It was against this background of U.S. economic aggression as well as the previous
  launching by the U.S. of the anti-communist crusade under the sign of the Truman
  Doctrine that Stalin's policy of coalition governments in Eastern Europe became
  untenable.</p>

  <p>The turning point came in February 1948. It was then that the Czechoslovak workers
  militia, the trade unions, in alliance with many mass organizations which commanded the
  support of the overwhelming majority of the popular masses, proceeded to dissolve the
  bourgeois coalition government and institute a new, a socialist government.</p>

  <p>Had the masses been urged to use their revolutionary initiative in 1945 and had the
  party led them consciously toward an insurrectionary road to the seizure of power at
  that time, the bourgeoisie would have been crushed by the popular struggle of the
  people. The old state apparatus would have been smashed and the remnants of the old
  ruling class not only dispossessed, but reduced to insignificance.</p>

  <p>Such would have been the classical method of achieving a proletarian revolution. In
  fact that is the way it basically occurred in Russia, in China, and in Cuba. The
  creative energy of the masses themselves in destroying the old regime was the surest
  guarantee that the newly established workers government would have a solid foundation
  for its existence and further development.</p>

  <p>The February Revolution in Czechoslovakia, however, while it was carried out with
  tremendous popular support, did not proceed with the destruction of the old state
  apparatus, and left segments of the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois intelligentsia
  relatively free. This singularly important fact was to exercise a tremendous influence
  in the calculations of the Party in the formulation of policy, and later on was to
  re-emerge as a strong and abiding danger to the existence of the socialist
  government.</p>

  <p>Aside from any and all considerations of political policy, the continued existence
  of strong and formidable strata of the old ruling classes, many of them in positions of
  power and authority, laid the basis for the attempt at counter-revolution in 1968.</p>
