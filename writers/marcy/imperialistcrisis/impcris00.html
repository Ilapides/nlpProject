  <h5>Imperialism &amp; the Crisis in the Socialist Camp [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>On January 28, 1979, China's Deputy Premier Deng Xiaoping arrived in Washington for
  a nine-day visit that was to consummate a counter-revolutionary alliance between the
  leaders of the world's most populous socialist state and the biggest imperialist
  power.</p>

  <p>Just 12 days after Deng left the U.S. Chinese troops poured across the border into
  Viet Nam in a full-scale invasion. While the official posture in Washington was to
  deplore the invasion, concrete moves by the U.S. government &mdash; such as sending
  Treasury Secretary Blumenthal to China to discuss trade at the very height of the war
  &mdash; showed that the Carter administration's pose of neutrality was a legalistic
  cover intended for world public opinion. In fact, the invasion had actually been
  discussed during the Deng-Carter meetings.</p>

  <p>The articles in this pamphlet, written both before and after the invasion, are much
  more than mere commentary on these events. They alert the progressive forces to the
  full magnitude of the betrayal by China's leaders by placing it in its historical
  perspective. Yet they go beyond recrimination of the individuals involved, examining
  the class forces at work and reviewing the preceding developments which led up to this
  momentous turning point.</p>

  <p>Sam Marcy, the chairman of Workers World Party, wrote the first two articles in this
  pamphlet as discussion material for an imminent plenary session of the National
  Committee of the Party. Given the critical world situation, the meeting had been
  expanded to afford a fuller participation by the Party membership. News of the invasion
  came February 17 as the session was opening, and the Party that day issued a public
  statement condemning the attack and linking it to the alliance that had been reached
  between the Deng leadership of China and the imperialist powers.</p>

  <p>This pamphlet answers the immediate questions that confront all activists in the
  anti-imperialist struggle: Which side is progressive in this war? Who do we support and
  who condemn? But it also explains what <strong>criteria</strong> to use in arriving at
  a position that will conform to the historic interests of the working class, the
  national liberation movements, and all progressive humanity.</p>

  <p>The line of thought on which these articles are based concerning the mutual
  relations among the socialist countries, and how they have been affected by the
  reciprocal relationship of each with imperialism, flows from an analysis that has been
  developed by Sam Marcy in several earlier pamphlets. These include <a href=

  "../china/index.html"><em>China 1977: End of the Revolutionary Mao Era</em></a> and
  <a href="../1977-ussr/index.html"><em>The Class Character of the USSR.</em></a></p>
