  <h1>4. The Great Socialist Destiny of China and Viet Nam</h1>

  <h4>February 21, 1979</h4>

  <p>Now that hundreds of thousands of soldiers from the Peoples Republic of China are
  pouring into the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in a brazen adventure to subdue a
  sister socialist country, one must inevitably ask oneself: Does it mean that the
  Chinese Revolution, which by virtue of universal agreement has been regarded by not
  only all socialists and communists but all progressives in the anti-imperialist
  struggle as the second greatest development in breaching the imperialist front and in
  establishing a socialist republic &mdash; has that been turned into its opposite?</p>

  <p>Has the monumental achievement in overthrowing the landlord-capitalist regime of
  Chiang Kai-shek and in breaking the chains to imperialism now been converted into its
  opposite? Has the wine turned to vinegar?</p>

  <p>Is the assault upon Viet Nam a reflection of such a development?</p>

  <p>It would be both foolish and inaccurate from the point of view of objective social
  development and the plain facts of life to draw any such wild and unfounded
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>For a long time, the leaders of China have persisted in making the false and utterly
  spurious accusation, also altogether unfounded, that the Soviet Union has become a
  "social-imperialist" state and that capitalism has been restored there.</p>

  <p>Subsequent history will verify that both accusations are equally unfounded and the
  result of excessive, false, and violent political polemics which have run their course.
  They no longer have any validity as a normal ideological struggle because they have
  been converted into a destructive, internecine, fratricidal, state-to-state
  struggle.</p>

  <p>What then has happened, first of all in China, to bring about such a dastardly deed
  as an attempt to subdue a small sister socialist state with whom it has just recently
  been in a solid alliance against a common enemy?</p>

  <p>What happened in China is what has happened in all great, truly profound social
  revolutions. The political pendulum, which swings from right to left and vice versa,
  during the course of all the great social and political transformations, has also swung
  in China as it did earlier in the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>Following a stormy period of revolutionary development, the pendulum has swung
  sharply and wildly to the right and has ushered in a politically and socially
  regressive tendency at the pinnacle of state power. Political reaction is in the saddle
  in China, and it is supported by all that is old, regressive, and downright rotten.</p>

  <p>Such developments have proven absolutely inevitable in almost all revolutions, as
  history attests by past experience. The socialist camp is not immune from it. In one
  degree or another, almost all the viable socialist states have either experienced it,
  succumbed to it for a while, made speedy recoveries, or are in the process of a life
  and death struggle for survival. One must consider that it is still a fact of
  contemporary life that the dominant mode of production in the world is capitalist.</p>

  <p>In the long struggle among the socialist countries, as a whole, against the forces
  of imperialism, heavy blows have been inflicted on the declining fortunes of monopoly
  capitalism. The latter, however, is by no means dead and has retained strong
  recuperative powers. Like any organism that is struggling to survive, it seeks out the
  vulnerabilities of its adversaries. The Sino-Soviet dispute disclosed to the class
  enemy a deep and abiding vulnerability which the latter exploited and utilized, and in
  the course of a long struggle it was able to bring within its orbit one of the
  principal contestants in the ideological struggle.</p>

  <p>These among others are the principal features behind the larger struggle which has
  convulsed the socialist countries.</p>

  <p><strong>Reaction is a temporary setback</strong></p>

  <p>What has triumphed in China, however, is that which is temporary, conjunctural, and
  not of lasting and enduring significance.</p>

  <p>The expansionism of Napoleon, which almost brought France to ruination, nevertheless
  did not nullify the revolutionary significance of the new social system which
  Napoleon's rule consolidated politically for the bourgeoisie. Nor did the succeeding
  restoration of the monarchies of the Legitimists and the Orleanists turn out to be
  anything more than the domination of different groupings, namely the industrial and
  financial sections, of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Where Napoleon's expansionism rooted out feudalism, its contribution was lasting.
  But its reactionary aspects elsewhere as a war of conquest brought France to the brink
  of ruin.</p>

  <p>If China's leaders had sought by a revolutionary intervention, however unwise that
  may have proven tactically, to intervene militarily in Thailand or in Burma, that would
  be one thing. And wouldn't the whole world support a revolutionary intervention to free
  Taiwan from the clutches of American finance capital?</p>

  <p>Alas, this is not the case, precisely because it is not revolutionaries who are at
  the helm of the Chinese socialist state but reactionaries. The intervention in Viet Nam
  is a war of conquest and as such must be condemned as a crime against a sister
  socialist state.</p>

  <p>What then is one supposed to do?</p>

  <p>Even where there is no other choice for the Vietnamese people than to try to beat
  back their would-be conquerors with arms in hand, as there is no other choice for
  progressive humanity but to support them, it would be tragic if the socialist
  perspective on both sides of the battlefield were to be blurred, or worse still
  altogether lost. All the more so, because it is the only abiding element which will
  surely emerge after the ruination and destruction of lives and property have taken
  their toll.</p>

  <p>In the final analysis, the irresistible pressure from the social foundations in both
  countries to carry on with socialist construction will mean that it will have to be
  resumed, no matter how long it takes. That is the inevitable wave of the future. The
  present dark interlude is a temporary detour from the fundamental course of the
  inherent social evolution of both countries.</p>

  <p>Viet Nam cannot be conquered. The reactionary group at the helm of the Chinese state
  will not be able to set the clock back long, either at home or in its sister socialist
  state.</p>

  <p>The Deng-Hua grouping will prove to have an ephemeral existence. Its social roots
  are in the past and not in the present or the future. China needs socialist
  construction as a living organism needs air to breathe, which in turn means peace and
  harmony with its socialist neighbors. The wrong turn away from the socialist course
  will have to be reversed, even if it first takes a huge toll in life and property.</p>

  <p>In the long run, it can only be the workers, the peasants, and the revolutionary
  vanguard elements in China who can right what is wrong with both the domestic and
  foreign course of current Chinese policy. It is in them as well as in the Vietnamese
  people that the greatest confidence must be put.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the battle rages, but even as we all must gather worldwide support
  to help the Vietnamese push back the counter-revolutionary assault we must bear in mind
  that such a military solution, vital as it is to free Viet Nam from aggression, would
  merely contain the reign of reaction in China to its borders, it would not solve the
  problem.</p>

  <p>The destiny of socialism in China depends on the inner forces still inherent in the
  Chinese Revolution, on its tremendous gains, on its ability to recuperate from its
  self-inflicted wounds and move forward, hopefully the sooner the better, in the spirit
  of fraternal and socialist solidarity with all the socialist countries against the
  fundamental enemy of our time, decadent monopoly capitalism.</p>
