  <h1>2. Behind the U.S. 'Neutrality' Posture</h1>

  <h4>February 13, 1979</h4>

  <p>From all that has been said earlier on relations between the socialist states, the
  one new and absolutely ominous phenomenon is the possibility of a wide conflict pitting
  one socialist state against another socialist state. Nothing like this has ever
  happened to any large degree (dismissing for a moment the Sino-Soviet border conflict
  in 1969 at the Ussuri river). Such a conflict spells out the gravest dangers for the
  cause of socialism and the destiny of humanity.</p>

  <p>To deny that the Sino-Soviet conflict is a struggle between socialist states is to
  close one's eyes to reality. And it is even worse to become an adherent of one or the
  other of the socialist countries on the spurious grounds that the other is capitalist
  or social-imperialist. This will only help in the adulteration of the class
  consciousness of the working class. To dilute the working class approach, to discard
  Marxist-Leninist analysis, means to substitute instead a form of bourgeois
  ideology.</p>

  <p><strong>Which is allied with imperialism is key question</strong></p>

  <p>Whichever socialist country solicits aid from imperialism, allies itself with
  imperialism, either overtly or covertly, or receives aid from imperialism, directly or
  indirectly, to fight another socialist country, becomes an accomplice of imperialism
  and therefore must be denounced and condemned. The correct attitude of the
  international working class and the oppressed in such a conflict must be based on who
  is allied or seeks an alliance with, who is aided and abetted by imperialism.</p>

  <p>In a certain way such a situation is analogous to two trade unions in the midst of a
  jurisdictional or other dispute. The attitude of the workers should first of all be
  shaped by which union is allied with or is aided and abetted by the company. For if a
  union, however laudable its proclaimed aims and objectives, or high-sounding its
  pronouncements, is allied with or in collusion with the company, it thereby ought to
  lose the confidence of the workers.</p>

  <p>It is in this light that we must examine the most recent trends in the evolution of
  U.S. strategy and tactics in relationship to the socialist countries.</p>

  <p><strong>U.S. professes 'neutrality' in Sino-Soviet dispute</strong></p>

  <p>At the present moment the Carter administration has opened a foreign policy campaign
  designed to demonstrate that it holds a neutral position in the struggle between the
  USSR and China and that its only concern is to maintain "peace and a stable system of
  independent states in Southeast Asia." "We are not taking sides," said a State
  Department policy statement, "in the struggle between Communist states in Asia."</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the policy announcement went on to say that the U.S. would be
  "seriously concerned over a Chinese attack on Viet Nam." "We have expressed our
  concerns," the statement went on, "directly to the Vietnamese, Soviet, and China
  governments about the dangers of continued, perhaps expanded, fighting."</p>

  <p>Continuing in the same vein, the statement went on to say, "Our confidential
  discussions with these governments have been fully consistent with our public
  statements We remain seriously concerned over the continued Vietnamese attack on
  Kampuchea."</p>

  <p>The State Department pronouncement, which it described as a policy statement
  endorsed by the White House, is a classic example of a cover story calculated to hide
  the real position of American finance capital in relation to the socialist countries.
  Its strong self-righteous assertions follow the basic outlines of a well-planned policy
  laid out long ago, indeed decades ago, following the victory of the Chinese Revolution,
  the establishment of the Peoples Republic, and the emergence of a whole series of
  socialist countries into a virtual fraternal alliance of a whole grouping of socialist
  states. However, these latest pronouncements constitute a new phase in the overall
  worldwide ideological struggle between imperialism and the socialist countries.</p>

  <p>The principal objective of U.S. policy is and has been to split the socialist
  alliance apart, poison relations among the several members, instigate one against
  another, and bring the day ever closer of military conflict among them. The State
  Department policy statement is by no means a new stratagem in the formulation of U.S.
  finance capital's basic foreign policy endeavors.</p>

  <p><strong>How U.S. 'neutrality' worked in WW I and WW II</strong></p>

  <p>On the contrary, it follows the long line of well-worn "neutrality" postures taken
  by the U.S. since the Spanish-American War and most particularly exemplified in the
  years before World War I and World War II. These postures almost always begin with
  strongly worded disavowals of any intention to get into the war or of aiding one side
  against another. They arc strictly calculated to appease the anti-war sentiments of the
  masses.</p>

  <p>Gradually the momentum is built up by the capitalist press of the need to further
  arm the U.S. in case of "unforeseen eventualities" in which the U.S. has a "vital
  interest" (meaning a vital, predatory, imperialist interest). In the meantime, however,
  the war machine is more and more cranked up for action.</p>

  <p>In the interim period of "neutrality," which it turns out really means U.S.
  preparations for war, what is not so often well publicized but is of the greatest
  significance to imperialist finance capital is the frantic drive that commences to
  obtain economic, diplomatic, and political advantages deriving from the developing
  conflict. The sale of guns, war materiel, and ammunition of all sorts becomes a
  scandalously lucrative business. War orders destined for the belligerent countries,
  either secretly or overtly, become truly stupendous means of garnering
  super-profits.</p>

  <p>In the three years before the U.S. went into the First World War, the "war to save
  democracy," U.S. banks and industrial corporations amassed fabulous profits by
  accelerating trade and commercial deals, which reduced the Allied powers to virtual
  clients of American imperialism. Finally the U.S. entered the war when it was clear
  that the moment was most advantageous to its world position and from the viewpoint of
  becoming the bulwark of world reaction and the gendarme of world imperialist
  interests.</p>

  <p>The U.S. played essentially the same role in the days before it finally entered the
  Second World War. This left it in the supreme position to economically, politically,
  and diplomatically take over, as a legacy of the Second World War, the crumbling
  imperialist empires of Britain, France, Belgium, Holland, and what was left of German
  imperialist interests in Africa, Turkey, and elsewhere. The position of U.S.
  imperialism had been to squeeze out every ounce of economic advantage in the way of
  markets, areas of diplomatic influence, and sources of raw materials before it
  committed itself in the war against the fascist powers.</p>

  <p>It should not be forgotten that the so-called U.S. neutralist role during the
  Spanish Civil War was also completely fraudulent. In words, the Roosevelt
  administration allowed itself to be played up as sympathetic to the resistance struggle
  against Franco fascism. In reality, it viewed the Spanish Civil War as mainly a
  miniature military arena, a dress rehearsal for the larger war that was already well on
  the horizon.</p>

  <p>The profession of neutrality by American imperialism early in the First and Second
  World Wars differed, of course, from the kind of neutrality which the Carter
  administration, as well as the administrations of Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy, and Truman
  before him, envision in the struggle between the socialist countries. So far as the
  socialist countries are concerned, the basic aim of the U.S. is to see the socialist
  countries destroy themselves so the American bankers and industrialists can walk in,
  with a minimum of military forces, pick up the pieces, and resume the role of the
  unchallenged world exploiter.</p>

  <p><strong>Statement a cover for U.S.-China alliance</strong></p>

  <p>Thus the Feb. 9 U.S. policy statement on neutrality is deliberately made in strong
  language but is in reality a cover for the alliance between the U.S. and China and the
  broader one which encompasses Japan and NATO as well. The U.S. bankers and
  industrialists hope to first of all wrest as many economic, political, and diplomatic
  advantages from the PRC leadership as possible before the U.S. commits itself to
  sending sophisticated technology to China, particularly of a military type. In the
  meantime, Washington has given its blessing to West European attempts to sell military
  hardware to the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). These are already in progress.</p>

  <p>Thus the British Harrier helicopter deal as well as some deals made by the French
  and German imperialists have been approved by the Carter administration. There are
  other arms sales in the works meant to bolster the PRC war potential against the USSR.
  There can be no mistaking the fact that the neutralist stance of the U.S. is so
  preponderantly weighted against the USSR that it could scarcely be hidden from any but
  the most naive.</p>

  <p>At the same time that the U.S. State Department issued its hypocritical neutrality
  statement it vigorously asserted its "obligation" to help its ally in Southeast Asia,
  the reactionary Thai regime, with arms and economic assistance. It is an open secret
  that the PRC leaders are using Thai territory to funnel military assistance to the Pol
  Pot forces in the struggle against the Kampuchean National United Front for National
  Salvation. Arming the reactionary Thai government while its territory is being used as
  a funnel against the Peoples Republic of Kampuchea as well as against Viet Nam is in
  effect arming China against Viet Nam and Kampuchea.</p>

  <p>Should these efforts by the U.S. fail to overwhelm the Kampuchean forces and should
  the efforts by NATO, Japan, and the U.S. in supplying the PRC with technology and
  materiel nevertheless also fail to overwhelm the Vietnamese, it is a foregone
  conclusion that U.S. efforts at quickening the pace in the delivery of military aid and
  material support to China will take on a new, more ominous dimension. This however will
  in no way exclude the continual play-acting of the neutrality stance.</p>

  <p>As in past prewar periods, side by side with a so-called embargo on the export of
  arms to the belligerents, there is also the supplying of war materiel and military and
  economic assistance. Such export bans have been entertained by the U.S. Congress and
  passed in earlier prewar days, but have always proved to be a dead letter in practice.
  As night follows day the developing war psychosis grips the military establishment and
  as the capitalist media whip up a hysterical campaign for the U.S. to enter the arena
  the administration finally and "reluctantly" enters the war to "defend its own vital
  [i.e., imperialist] interests."</p>

  <p><strong>Revolutionary uprisings can upset U.S. war plans</strong></p>

  <p>At the present moment the imperialist establishment has its hands full with the
  Iranian Revolution and the possibility of a blow-up in the Middle East where a varied
  assortment of U.S. puppets are sitting on a virtual powder keg.</p>

  <p>The mass of the people in the U.S. are still war-weary as a result of the Viet Nam
  debacle. A much larger section of the population than ever is conscious of the
  vulnerability in U.S. imperialism maintaining a far-flung world empire at a time when
  revolutionary conflagrations, ignited by tremendous mass protest and indignation
  against oppression, are ever more prevalent.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, moves in Congress such as that made by Senator Stennis urging the
  renewal of the draft, long championed by the Pentagon, are a sign of what the
  militarists are pushing for. The swollen military budget, which keeps ever rising, is
  without a doubt the single most significant indicator as to where the military
  establishment and the military-industrial complex are hopelessly heading.</p>

  <p>But the mass of the people are not at all acclimated to any type of war adventure
  which involves actual military intervention, especially on a large scale. The most
  likely course to be taken by the U.S. government is for it first to slowly position
  U.S. forces in areas where they seem to serve a purely defensive purpose but where
  their presence will inevitably take on a Tonkin Gulf coloration.</p>

  <p><strong>It must be remembered that there never was a Congressional vote in favor of
  the Viet Nam or Korean wars.</strong> Executive actions by the Truman and Johnson
  administrations proved to be definitive war measures without Congressional sanction.
  They were <em>faits accomplis</em> and Congress rubber-stamped the actions. The
  intervention in the Dominican Republic wasn't even put to a Congressional vote of any
  sort.</p>

  <p>Nor does the so-called War Powers Act of 1974, which is supposed to limit
  Presidential and executive action in the military field, really stand in the way of
  unilateral action by the White House and the Pentagon. The tree-cutting incident on the
  DPRK side of the demilitarized zone, which seems almost to be forgotten now, was a
  clear test of whether this limitation of Presidential authority in military affairs had
  any validity. But no one in Congress raised any voice when the administration
  threatened to use military action against the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.</p>

  <p>There is no question, of course, that U.S. imperialism is beset with tremendous
  problems of both an internal and external character, especially now that the Bakhtiar
  regime has been overthrown and the Iranian Revolution is in full swing. This has upset
  and thrown into confusion the factional alignments in the imperialist
  establishment.</p>

  <p>It also has to reckon with the possibility that the outbreak of Sino-Soviet military
  warfare will <strong>not</strong> degenerate into a war of annihilation, but on the
  contrary may result in a short-lived military skirmish which ends up in a basic
  settlement all around among the socialist states. This again and again explains the
  extremely cautious position the Carter administration is taking towards its new
  alliance with China and its dogged efforts to completely hold Taiwan as a hostage in
  case China "reneges."</p>

  <p><strong>Potential for broad anti-war sentiment in U.S.</strong></p>

  <p>Nor is it altogether excluded that the U.S. may find itself committed to large-scale
  military intervention at a time when popular anti-war sentiment in the United States
  can easily become rekindled. Nor is there likely to be a repetition of what happened
  during the Viet Nam War when the labor movement and the working class as a whole
  remained passive. The situation today finds an extremely discontented working class as
  well as middle class.</p>

  <p>The efforts of the Pentagon's colossal war machine to divert this dissatisfaction
  into war channels may, contrary to their expectations, not turn out at all. Swift moves
  by the Pentagon war machine may bring in their train changes in the mass consciousness
  of the working class and the oppressed peoples as well as large sections of the middle
  class. For one thing, they are sure to accelerate the inflationary spiral. Military
  moves on a large scale, moves which cannot be hidden from the sight of the mass of the
  people, are likely to get their wrath as well as their attention and notice.</p>

  <p>Even now, there is a slow awakening, a gradual realization that it is the Pentagon
  and the swollen defense budget which is a basic cause of the galloping inflation.
  Capitalist politicians who up to now have failed even to mention the war budget have
  begun to speak out against it, if ever so timidly. Just two years ago Congress went
  beyond the request of the Pentagon for defense appropriations. This is no longer the
  prevailing mood in the light of skyrocketing inflation.</p>

  <p>A military adventure by the U.S. is sure to focus the anger of the masses upon the
  government and its war policies more so than in earlier periods, when defense orders
  seemed to be the answer to unemployment. This myth is being ripped to tatters.</p>

  <p>The loss of payment for $8 to $10 billion worth of military orders as a result of
  the Iranian Revolution illustrates that the mere piling up of many billions of dollars
  worth of weapons orders, presumably to defend U.S. interests, does not safeguard or
  secure jobs in defense plants but makes them more precarious.</p>

  <p>In the countries which have these weapons shoved down their throats, the problems
  multiply over the decades, especially when their social and political significance has
  been hidden. What was originally seen by the imperialists as a lucrative market can
  explode in their faces, as witness the stunning blow to imperialism so vividly
  demonstrated by the Iranian Revolution. The latter is only the precursor of other, more
  far-reaching developments.</p>

  <p>For all these reasons the U.S. posturing of neutrality in the developing conflict in
  Southeast Asia is not likely to serve as much of a cover for its predatory designs. But
  it does emphasize the dangers involved for the capitalist establishment in moving too
  hurriedly at a time when the fires of revolutionary ferment are engaging the
  imperialist colossus on many other fronts.</p>

  <p><strong>Struggle over U.S. foreign policy</strong></p>

  <p>Nevertheless, from a broad historical perspective it is the dynamics of monopoly
  capitalism with its congenital propensity in the direction of military adventures which
  is decisive. This is what constitutes the overriding factor in the makeup of U.S.
  foreign policy. It is no wonder that since the day the Carter administration formally
  took office and completed filling its Cabinet posts and staff, it has been wracked by a
  constant, relentless, and overriding conflict precisely on the direction of U.S.
  foreign policy.</p>

  <p>In the public eye and in a formal sense it takes on the shape of a struggle between
  "hard-liners," the outlandishly and outrageously pro-war faction as symbolized by
  National Security Advisor Brzezinski, and those who take the stand and posture of the
  more moderate wing in the administration, as exemplified by Secretary of State Vance
  and his coterie of supporters.</p>

  <p>The fact that both these wings can continue in the administration over such a long
  period attests to the fright of the administration in decisively breaking with one or
  the other.</p>

  <p>It is not that there is really a substantial difference between the two. In reality
  it is the traditional division of labor between soft cop and hard cop, both having the
  same objective. However, in the present circumstances a definitive tilt to one
  direction or another would almost surely upset the equilibrium of forces within the
  ruling establishment.</p>

  <p>An open disavowal of the Vance forces would cause a tremendous weakening of popular
  support for the Carter administration and tend to expose it to peril in the event a war
  crisis develops in the period immediately preceding the presidential elections.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, a disavowal of the Brzezinski wing, such as his own personal
  elimination from office, would even pose the possibility, while admittedly very remote,
  of a military coup, although the so-called debate now going on between the ultra-right
  and the administration is still formulated in terms of polite controversy. However,
  this possibility must not be dismissed given the Kennedy experience after Viet Nam and
  the Bay of Pigs.</p>

  <p>It is not the elimination of Brzezinski as an individual which would be very
  significant, since he himself, like Kissinger before him, has no independent base of
  his own in the ruling class. Kissinger as well as Brzezinski are personages who have
  been retained, that is hired, by powerful sections of the ruling class, Kissinger by
  the Rockefellers, Brzezinski by a coalition of the military-industrial complex and
  others. Neither Brzezinski nor Kissinger can independently on their own wield a great
  deal of authority in political affairs.</p>

  <p>Underlying everything else is the continued and never-ending crisis of the economic
  system itself, which seems to know no end to continual and evermore serious
  disturbances.</p>

  <p>It is a matter of public record that while in the early 1920s it used to be the more
  radical economists of the bourgeoisie who direly predicted capitalist crises, and the
  conservative bourgeoisie seemed to ooze nothing but ever-lasting capitalist prosperity,
  things have turned upside-down today! Now it's the conservative bourgeois economists
  who almost daily predict an oncoming recession, as they call it.</p>

  <p>They almost wish for it and pray that it will come sooner in the hope that it will
  be a short one. The longer the period of relatively stable industrial production
  continues, the more fearful they are that the ultimate bust which is sure to come will
  be far more disastrous, if not catastrophic.</p>

  <p>Thus the politics of the bourgeoisie in the main are concerned with harnessing the
  productive capacity of the country to maintain a stable equilibrium of the social
  system, an equilibrium which means, so far as the relationship between the working
  class and the bourgeoisie, between the exploited and exploiter, an intensification of
  exploitation and ever-greater pressure for the extraction of surplus value from the
  hides of the workers and the oppressed.</p>

  <p>The consequent buildup of a formidable ocean of discontent and dissatisfaction is
  bound to reach the surface of open political struggle.</p>
