  <h5>Imperialism &amp; the Crisis in the Socialist Camp [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>1. An Historic Betrayal</h1>

  <h4>February, 6. 1979</h4>

  <p>The end of the Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-ping) visit to the United States and the
  anti-Soviet joint press communique of China and the U.S. mark the end of a definite
  historical period in the relations between the socialist states and in particular the
  relations between the Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China.</p>

  <p>To all intents and purposes a virtual de facto alliance now exists between U.S.
  imperialism and the Peoples Republic of China. It is part of a larger alliance
  embracing NATO and Japan and directed against the USSR and Viet Nam. This portentous
  development, which would have been regarded as utterly incredible just a few years ago,
  must now loom large in the calculations of all the socialist countries, the
  international communist movement, and the democratic and progressive forces throughout
  the world as an immense danger to them all. There can be no question that on the part
  of the Chinese leadership, a historic betrayal on the magnitude of the treachery
  committed by the Social Democratic leaders in August 1914 has taken place.</p>

  <p>It is at the same time a tremendous boon to all the forces of political reaction and
  will not only do much to bolster the morale of all who rely upon the good graces of
  imperialism but is bound, at least in the immediate future, to raise the fortunes of
  world finance capital.</p>

  <p>It goes without saying that it cannot but be regarded as a most ominous development
  in the working class and among all progressives. In any case it is a profound
  disappointment to all who have championed the cause of the Chinese Revolution. It can
  scarcely be doubted that virtually all of progressive humanity welcomed the Chinese
  Revolution, took pride in its accomplishments, and saw in it a source of strength and
  inspiration for all involved in the struggle against imperialist enslavement and
  exploitation.</p>

  <p>The new Washington-Beijing-Tokyo-NATO axis has not of course overthrown socialist
  China and installed a bourgeois regime, even though the new leadership in Beijing
  (Peking) has done untold damage at home and abroad to the cause of the Chinese
  Revolution. However, by and large the new Washington-Beijing alliance rests on the
  endurance of the current grouping in Beijing in retaining and strengthening its hold on
  the levers of state power in China. Whether it can do so remains to be seen.</p>

  <p>The consummation of the Washington-Beijing rapprochement is testimony to the
  struggle waged by the U.S. and its imperialist allies for decades to instigate,
  envenom, exploit, and divide the socialist countries which has ultimately succeeded in
  bringing one of them, even if only temporarily, into their orbit.</p>

  <p>At the same time it must be pointed out, however disagreeable it may sound to them,
  that the respective policies pursued by the leaderships of both the USSR and China have
  ended up as a monumental political failure. It is necessary that this be said. For if
  seen from the viewpoint of the origins and development of the struggle, neither
  anticipated that what was originally an ideological struggle would evolve into the kind
  of state-to-state struggle which would end up in one consummating an alliance with
  imperialism against the other. The very result which each sought to avoid! This is the
  great paradox in the evolution of the Sino-Soviet dispute.</p>

  <p><strong>Neither socialist state can gain from split</strong></p>

  <p>Certainly if we view it from a subjective point of view, from the point of view of
  ideological-political tendencies in the struggle for leadership in the working class
  and liberation movements, neither China nor the Soviet Union can gain anything as a
  result of this unfortunate turn of events. This is notwithstanding the abundance of
  promises made by Washington to Beijing, both open and secret, on modernization and
  technology for China. History will confirm this.</p>

  <p>Only those who view either the Soviet Union or China or both as having degenerated
  into bourgeois states can possibly see any advantage gained by either of the two giant
  socialist states. But such a false assumption is either born out of blind and
  unrestrained fanatical self-delusion, fraud, or both, practiced upon themselves and the
  world movement of the workers and oppressed.</p>

  <p><strong>It is our duty above everything else in the course of participating in this
  crucial discussion on the crisis in the socialist countries to clearly, firmly, and
  without any equivocation reject and disqualify the false canard that either the USSR or
  China is no longer a socialist state in the commonly accepted sense as defined by
  Lenin, that is, where there has been the overthrow of the bourgeois-landlord ruling
  class and the institution of planned economy, which in turn is based on common
  ownership of the basic means of production and buttressed by the monopoly of foreign
  trade.</strong></p>

  <p><strong><strong>Whatever the setbacks, whatever the inroads, whatever the false
  policies, so long as these fundamental pillars remain it is the bounden duty of the
  world proletariat and the oppressed to defend them both against bourgeois political
  reaction from within and against the external pressures of imperialist aggression from
  without.</strong></p>

  <p>As the struggle intensifies and becomes fiercer, the class definition of the
  sociological basis of the USSR and China as socialist states is bound to be cast more
  and more into oblivion. This has the effect not merely of liquidating their class
  definition, but also of weakening and adulterating the class consciousness of the
  working class, of blunting the anti-imperialist struggle, and of diverting the course
  of the working-class struggle against capitalist exploitation and imperialist expansion
  into false channels. It raises the question for all in the movement of how to approach
  this utterly new phenomenon.</p>

  <p>For those who blindly start out from the viewpoint of defending one of the
  combatants in the arena, regardless of what political and world policy it pursues, and
  assumes that in the other socialist state, socialism, as they believed it to have
  existed, has been liquidated, the answers are all too easy. The tactics have all been
  worked out in advance and fashioned to perfection &mdash; until the next disappointment
  arrives.</p>

  <p><strong>Need a Marxist, class analysis of socialist countries</strong></p>

  <p>For serious working-class revolutionaries it is necessary to come to grips with the
  basic problem &mdash; a development utterly unforeseen in Marx's time or Lenin's time
  &mdash; a struggle between socialist states which holds out the gravest danger to the
  socialist future of humanity.</p>

  <p>We must begin with the firm foundation of Marxist sociology. We must begin with the
  clear understanding that it is a falsehood to deny the class character of either China
  or the USSR as socialist states in the Leninist meaning of that term. The glorified,
  false, and idealistic conception that socialism as a completed, classless society
  exists in the USSR or China was baseless to begin with and not derived from Marx's, or
  later, Lenin's conceptions &mdash; of what socialism constitutes in its initial stages
  &mdash; that is, merely a proletarian dictatorship.</p>

  <p>The attitude of the socialist countries toward Yugoslavia should have served as an
  object lesson in this regard.</p>

  <p>Whatever might have been the merits or demerits, the rights or wrongs, in the
  expulsion of the Yugoslav party from the Cominform, the fact that all the socialist
  countries, including China at that time, wrongfully cast not merely the Yugoslav
  leadership and party but the nature of its social system in the mold of a fascist state
  and then later were obligated to reverse themselves and go to the other extreme in
  order to win its friendship and recast it in a wholly socialist mold at a time when
  there is less reason than ever to do so, points up the great danger in throwing aside
  fundamental Marxist theoretical criteria in developing political assessments out of
  purely pragmatic considerations.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that nowhere in the world is there a serious section of the
  bourgeoisie which regards either China or the USSR as anything but socialist
  ("communist," as they call it). It is true that a great many of the learned apologists
  for the capitalist system characterize the Soviet Union and/or China as totalitarian or
  having a new governing elite or a new ruling class, as the case may be. But this is for
  popular consumption by the masses in order to deceive them.</p>

  <p>To the extent that it is directed against the more educated segments of the
  petty-bourgeoisie and intelligentsia, it is shrewdly calculated to divert them from
  taking a sympathetic and progressive position with relation to the socialist
  countries.</p>

  <p>When it comes down to practical political dealings with the socialist countries the
  imperialists deal with them on the understanding that they are governed by "centrally
  planned economies" (their codeword for a socialist country) and public ownership of the
  means of production, which, together with the monopoly of foreign trade by the
  socialist governments, constitute the most formidable obstacles to easy economic and
  political penetration by finance capital. Only when the leadership of the socialist
  countries permits itself to be seduced by the wiles of imperialist strategy or succumbs
  out of weakness, ineptitude, or lack of experience to the tremendous difficulties of
  socialist construction and thus objectively becomes representative of alien class
  forces can these penetrations be of a real danger to the cause of socialist
  construction. Under a firm revolutionary leadership they can on occasion and within
  specifically defined limits prove beneficial.</p>

  <p>There have of course been endless attempts at penetration by finance capital,
  especially in Eastern Europe, above all in Poland and in Hungary, not to speak of
  Yugoslavia. The last merely maintains the skeletal form of a socialist economy and
  politically is more in the camp of imperialism.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, in spite of these depredations by finance capital, in spite of the
  encroachments on the political sovereignty of socialist countries through economic and
  diplomatic means, in spite of many abhorrent errors in the construction of a socialist
  system, errors which rekindle dormant political reaction, in spite of all the divisions
  among the socialist countries including the recent debacle of the U.S.-China alliance,
  there is no question that, with the exception of Yugoslavia, it is wholly consistent
  with objective truth to say that there still exists a socialist camp, if not in the
  political and diplomatic sense, in the sociological sense, in the sense of class
  anatomy. All the more is it the duty of the world proletariat and oppressed to fight
  for the revival of unity in the socialist camp, to defend it against all forms of
  imperialist aggression, obstruction, and sabotage from without and bourgeois reaction
  from within.</p>

  <p><strong>How to reverse the trend toward military conflict?</strong></p>

  <p>The great problem in the contemporary phase of world history facing all the
  socialist countries, the working class, and the liberation movements is how to arrest,
  how to stop the internecine struggle in the socialist camp from deteriorating into
  full-scale military conflict. To a limited extent we have already seen this, as witness
  the earlier Viet Nam-Kampuchea border conflict and the possibility that the threats
  made by the PRC leadership against Viet Nam may turn into a reality.</p>

  <p>In a word, the problem is how to get out from a process which irretrievably leads to
  an abyss &mdash; one which holds out the danger of swallowing up the fundamental
  achievements of the world proletarian class struggle as embodied in the USSR China and
  other socialist countries. It holds out the possibility of the destruction of that
  which has taken millions and millions of lives and years of labor to construct, that
  which holds the greatest possibility for humanity to proceed in furtherance of
  liberation through the socialist reconstruction of society.</p>

  <p><strong>The strategical and tactical line which flows from this analysis makes it
  incumbent upon the world proletariat and oppressed everywhere to aim its fundamental
  thrust not against this or that socialist country, not against the USSR or China, but
  against imperialism which first attempted to overthrow both of them, then tried what it
  called local wars against socialist countries (Viet Nam, Korea), and political and
  economic sabotage supplemented by paramilitary intervention against all the other
  socialist countries.</strong></p>

  <p>It is imperialism which engineered the split in the socialist countries. It is
  imperialism which envenomed the relations between the USSR and China. It is imperialism
  which exerted the most severe pressures upon them, not excluding the threat of atomic
  annihilation. It is therefore now, as always since the development of the monopoly
  phase of capitalism, imperialism that is the main enemy.</p>

  <p>This, however, tragically enough, is no longer regarded as valid in some
  quarters(!), precisely at the time when it is most urgent and important. To pursue such
  a political line means in effect to subordinate the struggle against imperialism by
  casting either China or the USSR in the role of the fundamental enemy.</p>

  <p>The political line which addresses itself to imperialism and which admonishes it not
  to be taken in by Chinese or Soviet seduction is putting the shoe on the other foot. It
  is bound to fail.</p>

  <p>Leading individual representatives of the bourgeoisie now and then can be won over
  for a period to championing either the Soviet or Chinese position on the basis of
  imperialist interests. This, however, should not be confused with the basic attitude of
  the ruling class as a whole. Individual representatives come and go in the bourgeois
  camp but virulent anti-communism is a permanent integral part, not merely of the
  ideological armor of the bourgeois camp, but is central to imperialist interest and is
  driven by the powerful engines of the omnipotent military-industrial complex and
  supported by the entire banking fraternity of U.S. finance capital.</p>

  <p>From this it inexorably follows that working class propaganda has to be directed
  against <strong>imperialism</strong> for having attempted all these many, many years to
  split the socialist countries and having tried to entice their leaderships, as it has
  enticed, bribed, and corrupted certain leaders of neocolonialist countries into the
  camp of imperialism.</p>

  <p>If, as we said, the struggle intensifies, a class approach and analysis with regard
  to China and the USSR, as well as Viet Nam and Kampuchea, is bound to become more and
  more shoved into the background, diluted, or cast into oblivion.</p>

  <p>The political motivation for this, it is assumed, is to obtain broad mass appeal,
  but in reality since it lacks a working class approach it inevitably veers sharply in
  the direction of currying favor with bourgeois public opinion. The whole class struggle
  of the proletariat and the anti-imperialist struggle in particular gets lost in the
  course of this rivalry, supposedly to win progressive allies, but which in reality ends
  up in entangled and fruitless maneuvers with the bourgeois camp. This can only
  aggravate the harm done to both the USSR and China. It will tend to widen the struggle
  in Southeast Asia. The possibility of Chinese intervention against Viet Nam remains an
  ever-present danger.</p>

  <p><strong>Possibility of detente in socialist camp mustn't be denied</strong></p>

  <p>In the light of these ominous developments, it would be even more harmful to close
  the eyes of the proletariat and oppressed to the possibility inherent in the situation
  for a genuine socialist detente between the USSR and China and the eventual restoration
  of socialist solidarity in the entire camp.</p>

  <p>To proceed on the present basis inevitably and irresistibly leads to an acceleration
  in the deterioration in the relations among the socialist countries. The imperialists
  are desperately trying to obtain the broadest possible worldwide bourgeois front in
  order to isolate the USSR and its socialist allies. This cannot be countered by a
  reasoned approach to the bourgeoisie not to do it. Diplomatic maneuvers and agreements
  of all sorts with the imperialists may, and in the past, have proved to be necessary
  and helpful, but they are no substitute for a bona fide attempt to rectify and reverse
  the tragic erosion of socialist solidarity among the socialist countries. It is this
  which has been the mainstay in the struggle against imperialism.</p>

  <p>The real question all along since the development of the Sino-Soviet conflict has
  been where to direct the main thrust of the working class, the oppressed and the
  socialist countries. Should the main thrust be against China? Or, as the Chinese
  leadership would put it, against the USSR? This is the crux of the problem.</p>

  <p>It is aided and abetted by what Engels called, in his funeral speech at Marx's
  grave, an "overgrowth of ideology" &mdash; in this case, the heavy burden of false
  polemics over a period of more than two decades, to which the adversaries themselves no
  longer seem to adhere, and about which some would not even like to be reminded.</p>

  <p>It must be borne constantly in mind that for the first time in history since the
  existence of the socialist camp, one socialist country has openly and avowedly allied
  itself with imperialism against another socialist state. All the more is it necessary
  to view the emerging struggle in the light of this new complex phenomenon that the
  world faces.</p>

  <p>The worst of all things is to completely close the eyes of the working class and
  pretend that no such new phenomenon exists, to continue the false thesis that only one
  of the socialist countries is truly socialist and that the other has turned either
  fascist or social-imperialist.</p>

  <p>Compounding these difficulties is that there is no longer a common language among
  communists, precisely because of the introduction of the new and utterly spurious and
  self-serving doctrine of social-imperialism on the one hand and on the other the
  virtual obliteration of the entire course of the Chinese Revolution with the pretense
  that a bourgeois restoration in one form or another has already taken place in China
  without in so many words saying it.</p>

  <p><strong>The objective basis of the split</strong></p>

  <p>What is the objective basis of the split?</p>

  <p>Examining the political dispute in the socialist camp, and its subsequent
  degeneration into a state-to-state struggle, in isolation, separate and apart from the
  reciprocal relations with imperialism, guarantees a false analysis, no matter how
  exhaustively and minutely this is done. One has to begin with the sum total of world
  reality as it exists today and its multitude of interrelationships before being able to
  examine any part of it, however formidable, in isolation.</p>

  <p>It is first of all necessary to take into account that the capitalist mode of
  production, even in the epoch of decadent monopoly capitalism, is still the predominant
  one. The socialist mode of production, even after more than 60 years in the Soviet
  Union and 30 years in China, is only in its infancy.</p>

  <p>One of the fundamental differences between the capitalist and socialist modes of
  production is that capitalism grows spontaneously, blindly and independently of the
  will of the capitalists themselves. A socialist society, however, can only be built
  consciously on the basis of planning and on the basis of the common ownership of the
  basic means of production. These are the barest minimums necessary to begin the arduous
  task of constructing a new social system without exploitation and oppression.</p>

  <p>Socialist construction also requires a minimum degree of stability and a material
  basis in technology, science, and the productive forces generally. Above all, it
  requires freedom from external interference, counter-revolutionary sabotage, threats of
  invasion, and imperialist military intervention. No socialist country has been free
  from this for any length of time, not even the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>It is important to go over again and again the preponderant role of imperialism,
  which has hung over all the socialist countries from virtually the day of their birth
  to the present. None of the socialist countries, not even China today with its virtual
  alliance with imperialism, is free of this pressure. Once this is forgotten, no
  appreciation on a revolutionary Marxist basis of the current state of relations among
  the socialist states is possible.</p>

  <p>It is best to keep in mind the period immediately after the Second World War. The
  U.S. emerged from the Second World War as the predominant world force on the
  international arena. All of Europe was virtually in ruins. So was Japan. The Soviet
  Union had lost more than 20 million lives in warding off the fascist powers.</p>

  <p>The U.S. and its Allied imperialists took a slow boat in launching the second front
  in Europe. It was not the might of the Nazi armies which caused the delay. It was a
  shrewdly calculated political maneuver. Its purpose was to bleed the Soviet Union as
  much as it could and drain off as much of its military power as possible.</p>

  <p>Once it was clear that Germany was being defeated, however, and Soviet troops were
  actually on German soil, then the Allied imperialists launched the D-Day invasion and
  moved as quickly as possible in what seemed to be an effort more to confront the Soviet
  army than to defeat the Nazi war machine.</p>

  <p>The whole aim was not merely to thwart the Soviet Union's military advance but also
  to insure the survival of the European bourgeoisie against possible proletarian
  revolutions in Western Europe, aided and encouraged by the presence of the Red
  Army.</p>

  <p>The class perspective of the Allied imperialists was never blurred by the
  outlandishly reactionary and repressive character of the Nazi regime. Notwithstanding
  all the protestations of friendship and alliance with the USSR during the war period,
  the basic aim of imperialism was not only to subdue Hitler but even more importantly to
  make sure that the anti-Nazi alliance would inflict as little damage as possible on the
  ruling classes of European, Japanese, and American imperialism.</p>

  <p>Thus when the war ended, the first item of business on the agenda of the
  imperialists was the "containment" of the USSR and the opening of a violent campaign to
  regain Eastern Europe and bring it back into the orbit of imperialism &mdash; an
  objective they have never lost sight of to this very day.</p>

  <p>It must be borne in mind that the victory of the Chinese Revolution in 1949
  compelled the imperialists, particularly in the U.S., to turn their attention to the
  Far East. But this did not substantially diminish their interest not merely in
  rehabilitating the ruling classes of war-torn Europe but in promoting all kinds of
  diplomatic as well as political penetrations of Eastern Europe with a view to
  curtailing the possibilities of the socialist countries there establishing a harmonious
  relationship with the Soviet Union and among themselves, while building a socialist
  order.</p>

  <p>With the triumph of the Chinese Revolution it became imperative for U.S. finance
  capital in particular to exert the most acute pressure on the socialist countries, from
  Poland in the Western part of the socialist camp to the Democratic Peoples Republic of
  Korea in northeast Asia. There was no let-up in the ruthless campaign unleashed by the
  Pentagon, State Department, and the Truman administration. Aside from the domestic
  aspects of the rise of McCarthyism, its foreign policy aspect was an unbridled campaign
  to move militarily against both China and the USSR.</p>

  <p>The revelation was recently made that even before the rise of McCarthy, none other
  than Churchill recommended the use of the atom bomb during the Berlin Crisis in 1948.
  This more than any single incident vividly demonstrates the terrifying pressure used
  against the socialist countries in order to bend them to the will of imperialism.</p>

  <p>The period of the 1950s included a number of wars launched by imperialism, the two
  most important ones against socialist countries &mdash; one against Korea and the other
  against Viet Nam. There wasn't even an interval of two years for China to consolidate
  the victory of the Chinese Revolution before the PRC was obliged to commit a good part
  of its army in defense of Korea and its own borders.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that French imperialism was defeated by the Vietnamese at Dien
  Bien Phu, and U.S. imperialism had been forced to a stalemate over Korea earlier,
  imperialism by no means diminished its worldwide counter-revolutionary efforts directed
  against all the socialist countries. The pressure against them has been constant,
  unremitting, and unrelenting.</p>

  <p>It has been of a military interventionist character, as we have seen in Viet Nam and
  Korea, in addition to the economic, diplomatic, and political pressure exerted against
  all the socialist countries. This has forced them all to divert an ever-larger portion
  of their gross national product for military defense. It has forced the Soviet Union to
  become if not the equal, at least a near equal to the U.S. in military strength, a role
  which has been imposed upon them by imperialism.</p>

  <p><strong>Ideological struggle arose in response to imperialist pressure</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Thus if we are to ask ourselves what is the basic objective cause of the
  struggle in the socialist camp, and more particularly what is the cause of the struggle
  between China and the USSR, we must first of all look to the merciless pressures
  exerted by imperialism.</strong></p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, is it not true that the ideological struggle between the USSR
  and China has from the very beginning been over what approach to take to imperialism?
  That in sum and substance has been the axis on which the polemics have developed. There
  would never have been a question of a soft line or a hard line in relation to
  imperialism if imperialism had no longer existed after the Second World War and the
  victory of the Chinese Revolution.</p>

  <p>Even in the case of Yugoslavia's virtual defection, at least in part, to
  imperialism, one must look to the exigencies of the Balkan situation as seen from the
  vantage point of U.S.-British piratical policy in the Mediterranean. One must not
  forget that a genuine revolutionary struggle for the liberation of Greece had been
  going on for several years and that Yugoslavia was the target of imperialism for aiding
  and assisting the Greek revolutionary liberation struggle. Yugoslavia was a channel for
  aid from all the socialist countries to Greece.</p>

  <p>Without, for the moment, evaluating the character of the Soviet Union's policy in
  relation to Yugoslavia, the fundamental objective problem lay in the fact that
  Yugoslavia was in the front line of the struggle, in alliance with all the socialist
  countries. Because of its relation to the Greek revolutionary struggle, the
  significance of the Mediterranean, and also its potential revolutionary attraction to
  the Italian proletariat, Yugoslavia was targeted for the most intense and unremitting
  imperialist pressure. Coming at a time of growing friction between Yugoslavia and the
  USSR over policy in the Balkans and in Eastern Europe, this contributed heavily, if not
  mainly, to what may be called the basic objective reason for Yugoslavia's ultimate
  defection from the socialist camp.</p>

  <p>Why is it necessary to go into such detail to demonstrate the severe pressures
  exerted by the imperialists against the socialist countries? Is this not generally
  understood among all genuine socialists and communists?</p>

  <p>No, not entirely. The differences in the socialist camp are regarded on the whole as
  stemming purely from internal causes.</p>

  <p>Our view, on the contrary, holds that the objective basis for the split and struggle
  among the socialist countries lies in the external pressure from imperialism and that
  the internal struggle reflects that pressure in varying degrees and in different
  forms.</p>

  <p><strong>Internal legacy from earlier systems</strong></p>

  <p>This is not to say that all of the contradictions and antagonisms of both a social
  and political character are due altogether to the external pressure of imperialism. No.
  There is also a legacy left over by the previous social order. There are problems left
  over from both feudalism and capitalism which have been left unsolved.</p>

  <p>Both in China and earlier in the USSR, as well as in Viet Nam, Korea, and other
  countries, the new socialist regimes have not only to solve socialist tasks but tasks
  that have not been solved by the previous ruling classes.</p>

  <p>In a country like France, by contrast, the bourgeois revolution of 1789-1793 cut
  feudalism root and branch. It left for the proletariat the principal task of
  overthrowing the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>However, the new underdeveloped socialist countries, which include China, Viet Nam,
  Korea, and earlier included the USSR, have the twofold task of combating bourgeois
  institutions as well as the more intractable older habits, customs, and institutions
  left as the legacy of the earlier social order. To this of course must be added the
  tendency of imperialism (to the extent that it finds an avenue for influence in these
  countries) to strengthen political reaction left over from the past as against the
  progressive tendencies emerging to reorganize society on a socialist basis.</p>

  <p>In the period immediately following the death of Stalin, an ideological dispute was
  slowly emerging which took definite but somewhat concealed form with the so-called
  secret Khrushchev Report at the 20th Congress. From then on it came more and more into
  the open, although there were brief periods of accommodation and general political
  agreement.</p>

  <p>It was only in the early 1960s that the dispute took an open, public turn. It did
  not appear then that within the space of a few more years the ideological dispute would
  take on slowly but gradually a state-to-state form and even turn into violent military
  confrontation. But that finally happened in 1969 with the outbreak of military warfare
  over the disputed border along the Ussuri river.</p>

  <p><strong>History of the ideological issues</strong></p>

  <p>The political issues are important and relevant and go to the heart of the matter if
  we are seeking to arrive at the axis of the polemics &mdash; how to approach the
  struggle against <strong>imperialism.</strong> It is not the purpose of this document
  to go over the issues at the present time in detail. Suffice it to say that the Chinese
  leadership in its view took a revolutionary, intransigent line in the struggle against
  imperialism, for the revival of the revolutionary class struggle, and above all for
  relentless prosecution of wars of national liberation against imperialism.</p>

  <p>Most important, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) contested the
  prevailing position of the Soviet CP on the question of peaceful coexistence between
  capitalist and socialist states. It has been falsely attributed to the CCP leadership
  that they were against normalizing or conducting relations with imperialist states,
  particularly the U.S., because imperialist wars of aggression were fatalistically
  inevitable. But that was not their position.</p>

  <p>In a general way, casting aside polemical sallies and exaggerations inevitable in a
  long period of polemics, the CCP leadership claimed to revive and resuscitate Lenin's
  teaching on the inevitability of imperialist wars in the epoch of monopoly
  capitalism.</p>

  <p>The Soviet position, as expounded by its leaders, differed widely. They did not
  reject out of hand Lenin's conception of the inevitability of imperialist war, but
  their main and fundamental stress was not only on the possibility of a long-term
  coexistence between the imperialist and the socialist states but that it was such an
  overriding necessity in the age of the atom bomb as to make it a fundamental basis for
  the conduct of relations between the socialist and capitalist states.</p>

  <p>"The struggle for peace," as Soviet political literature abundantly made it clear,
  was the first priority in the class struggle of the world proletariat, and the national
  liberation movements had to be fitted into the constricted framework of this global
  conception of the Soviet leadership. Only on those terms could the struggle be waged at
  all.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Chinese CP leadership at the time, this was interpreted to be a
  subordination of the class struggle against the imperialist bourgeoisie and a virtual
  renunciation of national wars of liberation. The Soviet leadership accused the Chinese
  leadership of being "adventurist" in relation to imperialist wars and of in fact
  abandoning peaceful possibilities for the solution of urgent political problems.</p>

  <p>The CCP leadership in turn accused the Soviet leadership of surrendering the
  national liberation struggle and the class struggle in the West European countries and
  in Japan to bourgeois parliamentarism and of renouncing the struggle for the
  dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>

  <p>This polemic at first took on the character of a dispute between the Chinese CP and
  the Italian CP. (It was most fully expounded in the Chinese pamphlet, <em>The
  Differences Between Comrade Togliatti and Ourselves.</em>) In reality it was directed,
  of course, against the Soviet leadership.</p>

  <p><strong>China viewed 'coexistence' as collusion with U.S.</strong></p>

  <p>Over the long period in which the dispute continued, it became ever clearer that the
  Soviet leadership was promoting the conception not merely of coexistence but also of
  accommodation and cooperation particularly as regards the U.S. In the eyes of the
  Chinese CP leaders this meant the defense of the imperialist status quo and drew
  dangerously close to bidding for collusion between the Soviet leadership and the
  imperialists against the liberation struggles, while containing China in an isolated if
  not subjugated position.</p>

  <p>During this entire period, of course, there were innumerable imperialist
  provocations, counter-revolutionary wars of aggression against oppressed peoples, and
  outright brazen military intervention in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. As the
  leaders of China saw it, the Soviet leadership took a "soft" position as against their
  own hard line against imperialism.</p>

  <p>This is not to say that, notwithstanding the political and theoretical world
  conception of the USSR leadership regarding the relationship between imperialism and
  the socialist countries, it did not resist the incursions, provocations, and military
  interventions of imperialism. Nor is it correct to say that the Soviet leadership
  reacted mainly out of revolutionary and internationalist considerations, contrary to
  its public accommodationist, cooperative stance politically and diplomatically, as
  imperialist opponents of Soviet policy maintain.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Soviet responses as well as its initiatives over the course of this
  entire period seem in historic perspective to be born of pragmatic considerations,
  which does not exclude revolutionary defenses or initiatives. However, pragmatism was,
  and still is, the hallmark of its diplomacy and world outlook.</p>

  <p>For the most part its foreign policy especially is a reaction to imperialist
  encirclement, imperialist attempts at subversion and counter-revolution. Attempts to
  meet these challenges of imperialism have made it abundantly clear that Soviet policy
  had great and urgent need to find points of support on a global scale; supports which
  if they did not immediately improve the international position of the USSR vis-a-vis
  the U.S. and other imperialist powers, certainly inflicted tremendous blows against
  imperialism, circumscribed its area for the extraction of surplus value, and weakened
  it from that point of view. An example is Soviet support for the Cuban Revolution.</p>

  <p>Both China and the USSR passionately supported the struggle of the Cuban people and
  their leadership against U.S. aggression. As all the world knows, the Cuban crisis very
  nearly led to a nuclear war. All this happened notwithstanding the Soviet leadership's
  vigorous espousal of cooperation and accommodation between imperialism and the Soviet
  Union.</p>

  <p><strong>Political disputes need not lead to military conflict</strong></p>

  <p>Had the Sino-Soviet ideological dispute continued merely as a struggle for political
  line in the international communist movement, there is no reason whatever to believe
  that it could possibly have broken out into military warfare, notwithstanding all the
  dire predictions (really wishful thinking) in the imperialist press at the time.</p>

  <p>If one is to assume that the split or the expulsion, whichever way one views it, of
  the Yugoslav party from the Cominform was the first phase of the split in the socialist
  camp, one has to take into account that regardless of the severity of the measures
  which were imposed upon Yugoslavia by the socialist countries as a whole, which
  included China, it nevertheless did not lead to a military conflict. And that more than
  anything explains why they were able to restore normal and even somewhat fraternal
  relations with both China and the USSR.</p>

  <p>The imperialist interpretation of this and also that of the Yugoslav leaders rests
  mainly on the fact that the Yugoslavs have a strong army and no border between
  Yugoslavia and the USSR. That, however, cuts little ice when one considers the enormous
  possibilities which could have been evoked in the potentially explosive Balkan area
  which would have involved East European socialist countries and the USSR.</p>

  <p>The point is that it did not reach the level of the kind of struggle that is
  presently being waged between the USSR and China.</p>

  <p>Next September will be 20 years since Khrushchev had his Camp David meeting with
  Eisenhower. It is true that it didn't evoke the kind of euphoria that the bourgeoisie
  is now pouring out over Deng's visit to this country. The euphoria was more in the USSR
  and other socialist countries and in sections of the communist and progressive movement
  (but not in China).</p>

  <p>The avowed purpose then was to arrive at a modus vivendi with the U.S. on the part
  of the Soviet leadership and also to find a basis for cooperation and accommodation.
  But this was precisely what turned the Chinese leadership off. (Can't the Chinese
  leaders now see that Deng's visit is merely a Chinese version of the Khrushchev Camp
  David meeting?) Aside from the fact that there was no prior consultation between the
  Soviet and Chinese leadership on the agenda for the discussions with the U.S., it was
  wrong to initiate the Camp David summit meeting because it would inevitably be regarded
  by the Chinese leadership as conspiracy against China.</p>

  <p>This is so because China was still not recognized by the U.S., was still virtually
  blockaded economically and militarily, and prevented from regaining its proper seat in
  the United Nations &mdash; all due to the obstructive role played by the U.S.</p>

  <p>"Accommodation," "cooperation" &mdash; the Chinese leaders viewed these terms as
  codewords for collusion and conspiracy against China when employed by Soviet diplomacy
  as a stratagem for peaceful coexistence between two hostile social systems. But the
  Eisenhower administration, in line with the policy of its predecessor administrations,
  as well as its successors, did not at all succumb to the proposition advanced by some
  in the bourgeois camp of consummating a global deal with the USSR when Khrushchev was
  here of a kind which the U.S. is now attempting to entice the PRC into.</p>

  <p>Why? Why did not the Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy administrations or their
  successors project the kind of global deal that they presumably now are consummating
  with China? Their reluctance does not hinge <strong>primarily</strong> on whether the
  approach of the Soviet leadership is reformist or revolutionary.</p>

  <p><strong>Why imperialism views USSR as its principal enemy</strong></p>

  <p>It is based on the solid fact that the USSR as a socialist state, as a workers
  state, after having gone through all the trials and tribulations of its 60-year
  existence, through all the vicissitudes of reaction and progress by succeeding
  administrations of the Soviet state in the post-Lenin era, and especially after having
  gone through the crucible of the murderous Second World War, has emerged as a strong
  and viable socialist state, much stronger than any of the other socialist states,
  including China, of course.</p>

  <p>This is the predominant reason why the U.S. in particular and imperialism in general
  regard the USSR not merely with apprehension but as the principal enemy. By the very
  strength of its social system, its vast resources, its technological and military
  prowess, it can play a tremendously revolutionary and progressive role in world
  affairs.</p>

  <p>It has demonstrated this only recently in the cases of Angola, Mozambique, and
  Ethiopia, not to speak of the earlier and continuing support to the Cuban
  Revolution.</p>

  <p>The imperialists cannot particularly concern themselves, unless under a great
  imperative need, if a small country which does not have strategic significance and is
  not blessed with an abundance of oil, gas, uranium, or other precious and strategic
  materials, carries out a socialist revolution. It is only when that small country
  solicits aid to build socialism from the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union cooperates
  by granting such aid that it becomes a "menace to peace."</p>

  <p>The U.S. has learned to regard China with less apprehension since the downfall of
  the left-wing of the Chinese CP and the dismantling of the Cultural Revolution. Even
  during that period, when the U.S. politically attacked China most vehemently, it was
  out of fear of the revolutionary repercussions of the Cultural Revolution that the U.S.
  directed its blows against China. Nevertheless, even during that entire period, the
  main enemy in the eyes of the imperialists was still the USSR precisely because of its
  formidable strength as a socialist country and, as we said, its tremendous potential
  for aid on a worldwide basis in the struggle against imperialism. This has not been the
  case with China.</p>

  <p>It is not only due to the underdeveloped state of the economy in China. It is that
  China, for a variety of reasons, has never become the center for the worldwide
  revolutionary movement the way the Soviet Union became after the Bolshevik Revolution
  the central source for revolutionary energy, determination, political line, and of
  course, where possible, material support.</p>

  <p>During the trying days when the Chinese leadership met with the Soviet leaders in
  early 1950, the bourgeoisie, especially the U.S. media, were daily pouring out a
  barrage of propaganda calculated to show the so-called divergent interests between
  China and the USSR and the imminence of a split.</p>

  <p>The negotiations between the USSR and China proved most difficult. But in a document
  in 1950 we addressed ourselves to that very point, to the question of whether
  temporary, ephemeral, and narrow interests would triumph over the broader class
  interests which united the workers and peasants of both countries.</p>

  <p><strong>Broad class interests same for both China and USSR</strong></p>

  <p>We answered no. We based ourselves not on speculation born out of abstract
  theoretical premises but on the hard realities of the day, the urgent need in the
  struggle against the common enemy &mdash; imperialism &mdash; and that the current of
  history favors the triumph of these class interests over narrow interests championed in
  both China and the USSR.</p>

  <p>For well-nigh two decades our thesis seemed to hold at least insofar as open
  military hostilities were concerned. Today the current of history is running stronger
  than ever for the triumph of the broad class interests of the workers and peasants.</p>

  <p>Everywhere there are giant leaps in technology, in science, in communication, in all
  the modern fields of scientific endeavor, the groundwork is laid more and more firmly
  for cooperation and solidarity of the international working class, of the toilers of
  all lands and of all nationalities. It is the weight of oppression of exploitation and
  the divisive policy of finance capital which holds down the solidarity of the working
  class and oppressed. The organic tendencies in contemporary society surge constantly
  and incessantly forward toward unification on the basis of socialist solidarity.</p>

  <p>Everywhere the effort of the bourgeoisie to construct a bogus internationalism is
  proved to be a fraud because it represents the carnivorous tendencies of the
  transnational corporations and not the mass of the people. It exists on the back of the
  people like an incubus, a parasite, and does not permit the truly giant strides in
  industry, science, and technology to move forward for the benefit of humanity, but
  holds them back and seeks to shift them in the direction of imperialist war.</p>

  <p>All of this happens independently of the will of the imperialists. And it is the
  fear of the imperialists which at bottom has caused in the socialist countries the
  dislocation, chaos, and sabotage of what can truly be fraternal, cooperative efforts to
  lay the foundations for a socialist commonwealth from the tip of the Korean peninsula
  to the edges of the Baltic Sea.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie is only too mindful of the latent possibilities inherent in the
  social structures of China, the USSR, and other socialist countries, including those in
  Southeast Asia, Cuba in Latin America, Ethiopia, Angola, Mozambique, and the
  progressive democratic regime in Afghanistan, for a peaceful socialist alliance based
  on an identity of fundamental interests to oppose the incursions military threats and
  interventionist policy of imperialism.</p>

  <p>Most dangerous to the fortunes of imperialism is the revival of a genuine
  normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, which could proceed to a formalized socialist
  detente between the two giant socialist countries.</p>

  <p><strong>Imperialists fear latent possibility of socialist detente</strong></p>

  <p>If it is possible to have a detente, a genuine detente. that is. between the USSR
  and imperialism as the Soviet leadership has for so long believed in, then why is it
  not possible for a socialist detente with China? Why is it possible to have one with
  imperialism, and not with the socialist countries?</p>

  <p>The same question could be asked with even greater force and vigor of the Chinese
  leadership. If they can find such great virtue in a cozy relationship with the U.S., an
  imperialist country (the Chinese press has not denied the imperialist characterization
  of the U.S., at least not as of now), why cannot they find any of at least those same
  virtues in the USSR? Or is it that the U.S. no longer seeks "hegemony" in Latin
  America, the Middle East, Africa, and in Asia (Korea!)? And what about Taiwan?</p>

  <p>Probably one of the lasting elements of a subjective political character in the
  triangular relationship of China, the U.S., and the USSR lies in the unpublicized
  efforts of the leadership, both in China and the USSR, not so much to conspire with
  imperialism against each other, as to get out of the line of fire in imperialism's
  efforts to foment an imperialist holocaust to which it is daily building up
  independently of its will and in spite of all efforts to propitiate and mollify the
  appetites of the Pentagon and the military-industrial complex.</p>

  <p>What both China and the USSR objectively need to construct and further develop the
  socialist economics is peace and stability. It is precisely that which imperialism is
  determined to deny them.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note that amidst all the euphoria in the capitalist press calculated
  to embellish the nature of the U.S.-China rapprochement, President Carter went out of
  his way to deliberately insert a sentence in his formal statement before the press
  communique was issued in which the U.S. asserted that it "has its own separate
  interests and that China has its own responsibilities." It was as near a pronouncement
  as was possible within the framework of a so-called honeymoon period, of telling the
  Chinese leadership that they have their own class interests, and that the U.S. has its
  own imperialist interests, which China does not share but which the U.S. expects China
  to approve and help American finance capital to safeguard and secure.</p>

  <p>Thus Carter's line of demarcation, although sketched in the language of imperialist
  diplomacy, is a class line which the political, diplomatic, and military alliance
  between China and the U.S. cannot easily overcome. The class line is still the
  fundamental obstacle. That is why a segment of the bourgeoisie has its fears and doubts
  about the alliance. And a number of them are apprehensive that a reconciliation, as
  they call it, between the USSR and China is not only possible but probable.</p>

  <p>It is for that reason, more than for reasons of the narrower advantages of
  super-profits in Taiwan, that the U.S. wants to hold the island as a hostage to prevent
  a revival of the Sino-Soviet relationship.</p>

  <p>If the bourgeoisie is so fearful of that, is that not in itself enough to stimulate
  a measure of confidence in the broader perspective of socialist solidarity being
  revived, rather than the deterioration being carried to the length of utter and
  destructive folly?</p>

  <p><strong>Socialist goal must be unity of workers' movemenT</strong></p>

  <p>Just as Marx, Engels, and Lenin after them continually preached and promoted the
  cause of unity in the working class movement, regardless of the differences between its
  reformist and revolutionary elements, so it is our duty today to promote socialist
  solidarity among the socialist countries in a situation where the lines of demarcation
  are not at all that between reformists and revolutionaries, Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.
  No, the lines of revolutionary demarcation in political policy as between the Soviet
  leadership and the Chinese leadership depend almost wholly on circumstance.</p>

  <p>The USSR is in the vanguard of the world movement and stands out as the defender of
  oppressed people more than any other socialist country because it is capable of
  assuming that role in the concrete historical situation of today.</p>

  <p>The political changes in the USSR and China are not by any means dominated solely by
  the external relations with imperialism and the domestic situation in the respective
  governments of China and the USSR. The rest of humanity also exists. There are
  limitless opportunities for profound revolutionary changes which can encourage and
  induce a turn to revolutionary policy in both China and the USSR.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding Deng's promise to give moral support to the efforts of the U.S. and
  other imperialists to solve the Iranian crisis, the revolutionary momentum in Iran can
  go far beyond the political horizon envisioned by Khomeini and his supporters, and the
  possibilities for a revolutionary overturn along genuine socialist lines can cause a
  lot of second thinking both in Moscow and Beijing that perhaps the paper tiger is
  neither in the Soviet Union nor in China but in the citadel of imperialism, the
  U.S.A.</p>

  <p>At the moment, nothing is as unstable and tenuous as the position of the U.S. in the
  Middle East, although it is by no means the only area where imperialism is vulnerable
  and debilitated. The Iranian conflagration may spread far beyond the Persian Gulf. The
  sparks of the Iranian Revolution may light up areas of revolutionary struggle where
  tanks, guns, and missiles cannot overwhelm the ground swell of popular rebellion. Such
  indeed are the prospects American finance capital faces.</p>

  <p>It is no wonder that the imperialist media is beginning to ooze with pessimism
  growing out of its frustrations and failures in attempts to stifle the ever-growing
  number of rebellions in oppressed countries. Nor is there any peace between exploited
  and exploiter in Western Europe. The instability of the regime in Italy, the growing
  number of strike struggles in Britain, the bankruptcy of the reactionary government
  which took over in Portugal, and the intractability of the world economic situation
  make for poor prospects for stability in the precarious situation of world finance
  capital.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, do revolutionary Marxists have any reason at all to
  renounce the existence of virtually the strongest pillars of the socialist camp?</p>

  <p>On the contrary, it was never more important to strengthen the revolutionary class
  camp of the proletariat, which extends from one end of the earth to the other and
  encompasses a whole grouping of socialist states which includes both China and the
  USSR. That is what has to be borne in mind as imperialism moves closer and closer to
  perilous adventures in order to save itself from the destiny which it cannot avoid.</p>
