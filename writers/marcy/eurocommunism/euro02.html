  <h1>True and False Historical Compromise</h1>

  <h3>On the Italian CP</h3>

  <h4>May 7, 1976</h4>

  <p>Every worker, every militant who has ever participated in negotiations with the
  bosses, from the grievance level all the way up to industry-wide bargaining, knows that
  certain compromises with the employers are sometimes not only necessary but inevitable.
  The broad membership of the Communist Party of Italy (PCI), where Lenin's classic on
  this subject of compromises with the bourgeoisie (<em>Left-Wing Communism</em>) is
  probably more widely known than anywhere else in Western Europe, scarcely needs an
  introduction on the matter.</p>

  <p>What the Italian CP leaders, however, have been preaching for a considerable period
  now is not just another compromise on one or two specific measures with the ruling
  Christian Democrats. In the view of the PCI leaders, they have presented a wholly new
  historical concept called the "historical compromise."</p>

  <p><strong>PCI view of 'historical compromise'</strong></p>

  <p>This view holds that it is possible to achieve a compromise between the two basic
  contending classes in Italy on the deepest social, political, and economic issues which
  face the deteriorating social system there.</p>

  <p>What is involved is not just another of the many compromises between the PCI and the
  Christian Democrats. It's a compromise between the working class and the bourgeoisie
  which, if effected, would result in a coalition government between the PCI and the
  Christian Democrats on a lasting basis.</p>

  <p>The ruling class here is violently opposed to it, or so it says, and so is the
  Italian bourgeoisie. The bark may be louder than the bite, but let's first examine the
  nature of the historical compromise. There could be a false and utterly disruptive
  compromise which would lead the proletariat down the road to frustration and defeat. It
  is also conceivable however that there could be a different compromise, a compromise
  which might be historically viable.</p>

  <p>Real compromises between antagonistic social classes are not unknown in history, and
  are particularly striking in West European history. The PCI leaders must of necessity,
  in bringing this question to the fore, have thought of it. The reason for it is due
  entirely to the fact that they have sensed that Italy is slowly and gradually
  approaching a pre-revolutionary situation.</p>

  <p>The pressure from the working class on the one hand and the bourgeoisie breathing
  down their neck on the other have sent them scurrying for "new approaches." Yes,
  indeed, there can be a historical compromise between the antagonistic classes in Italy
  &mdash; the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. But the question of historical compromises
  must first of all be put in proper historical context and on a class basis.</p>

  <p>What the PCI is proposing and what the bourgeois press seems to be so violently
  opposed to is not a true historical compromise. What they are proposing to the
  bourgeoisie is not a sharing of power &mdash; real power &mdash; but at best a sharing
  of offices within the framework of the bourgeois system of capitalist exploitation.</p>

  <p>There is absolutely nothing new in this concept whatever.</p>

  <p><strong>Cabinet posts are not the power</strong></p>

  <p>Socialists and communists have held cabinet posts in bourgeois governments for
  decades. It has always served to screen the exploitation of the oppressed masses
  because the power the ownership of the means of production, and the state apparatus
  have remained exclusively in the hands of the ruling class. Communists as well as
  socialists, even in the highest cabinet posts, have merely served as administrators of
  the bourgeois state.</p>

  <p>This is not a historical compromise with the bourgeoisie. This is not a sharing of
  power, it is merely getting some crumbs and privileges for the officialdom of the party
  and some of their allies. It does nothing to ameliorate the rapidly deteriorating
  conditions of the broad masses of people.</p>

  <p><strong>A real historical compromise</strong></p>

  <p>However, there can be a historical compromise between the basic social classes in
  Italy. The PCI leaders, in discussing it with the bourgeoisie, should say this:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Yes, we want a historical compromise with you. But what you have in mind is a
    compromise on the basis of the existing social system, your social system in which
    you hold all the levers of power and we are given the role of mere officials obliged
    to put fires out wherever the general anger of the masses rises into explosive
    proportions.</p>

    <p>"We propose a compromise on the <strong>foundations of a new social system, our
    system;</strong> on the basis of the ownership and control of the means of production
    in our hands, in the hands of the workers. This will permit us to begin a planned
    socialist economy.</p>

    <p>"You must hand over to us the levers of political power and authority and permit
    us to erect new forms of political organization and state structure. We must have the
    controlling and dominating factors of economic and political life in our hands.</p>

    <p><strong>"We will then make concessions to you.</strong> We can permit the
    existence of small-scale industry, small-scale commodity production. If you will not
    obstruct the transition to an orderly, truly socialist transformation of society, you
    will avoid violence and civil strife in which you will surely go down to an
    ignominious death. You say you want a peaceful, orderly transition to a social order
    which avoids civil war. This is the road.</p>

    <p>"You must also promise to renounce your alliance with the big imperialist powers,
    especially the U.S., and especially renounce the use of illegal methods and abide by
    socialist legality the way you forced us to abide by bourgeois legality.</p>

    <p>"Now then, such historical compromises are not new to you, the bourgeoisie. The
    British bourgeoisie compromised with the feudal lords, but on the basis of the
    bourgeois order, on the basis of capitalist exploitation as against feudalism. Of
    course, you know that happened in Italy, too. Admittedly there is advantage for us
    Communists in such a transition to power. We also want to avoid a violent and
    ruthless civil war which will become inevitable if peaceful methods of transition to
    workers' power are obstructed. Every new social order that starts after a long and
    violent struggle of necessity starts at a <strong>lower tempo of industrial
    development</strong> as a result of the chaos, disruption, and violence brought on by
    the resistance of the ruling class. We would like to avoid it, if possible.</p>

    <p>"So you see, it is possible to speak of a historical compromise, but it must now
    be on the basis of a new social foundation, a new social order, and we will make the
    necessary concessions to enable you to exist &mdash; not forever, of course. Even the
    Church does not believe that the bourgeoisie is an eternal category. You upholders of
    the faith must agree to that!"</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But instead of presenting a real historical compromise to the bourgeoisie, one which
  the leaders of the PCI have unquestionably been thinking about more and more as Italy
  approaches a prerevolutionary crisis, they have in fact presented a masked form of the
  crassest class collaboration.</p>

  <p><strong>What the rulers fear</strong></p>

  <p>Why then is the bourgeoisie, especially in the U.S., so violently opposed to it? It
  is not because, as has been drummed into the heads of the American people, the
  Communist leaders "cannot be trusted." The reality of the situation is that the PCI
  leaders have collaborated with the Christian Democrats and the bourgeoisie generally
  for decades.</p>

  <p>It is not the leaders that the ruling class fears.</p>

  <p>What they fear, and this is the most important element in the resistance of the
  State Department here and of the Italian bourgeoisie to allowing a coalition government
  which would include the PCI, is that it would inevitably heighten the revolutionary
  insurgence of the masses and serve as a tremendous impetus in the struggle against the
  ruling class.</p>

  <p>What the bourgeoisie see as a result of a coalition government with PCI
  participation, and what the PCI leaders themselves see and fear, almost equally to the
  bourgeoisie, is that the coalition government would result in spontaneous revolutionary
  intervention of the masses &mdash; that they would begin to take things in their own
  hands as they have frequently done: in France in the 1930s, in Spain, more recently in
  Portugal, and earlier in Italy itself in pre-Mussolini days. An electoral victory for
  the PCI and its inclusion in a coalition government would bring about the familiar
  phenomenon of plant managers being ousted from their offices, workers occupying the
  plants, peasants taking over the land, and the virtual beginning of workers' control
  and real dual power.</p>

  <p>All this explains the hesitancy of the PCI in joining the coalition and their lack
  of enthusiasm for an early election. For the very idea of a general election obliges
  the PCI even against its will to open the attack against the bourgeoisie &mdash; to
  "incite the masses" &mdash; even if the propaganda of the PCI is of the mildest
  character. Such is the internal logic of the developing social crisis in Italy.</p>

  <p><strong>Attitude of the revolutionary left</strong></p>

  <p>What should be the attitude of the revolutionary left in Italy in the face of such
  unabashed, unashamed revisionism of the PCI? The worst thing would be if they resort
  exclusively to violent revolutionary polemic, or otherwise engage in activity which
  would alienate them from the broad masses of the communist workers and the communist
  electorate generally.</p>

  <p>There is every evidence that the progressive and most viable sections of society
  &mdash; the working class, the peasantry, especially the poor and landless ones, and
  the lower petty-bourgeoisie &mdash; are gravitating in the direction of the PCI and
  look with hope, if not enthusiasm, to the pending election.</p>

  <p><strong>The task of the revolutionary left is to facilitate an electoral triumph of
  the PCI.</strong></p>

  <p>The sooner they get into it, the swifter will be the experience of the masses under
  the new historical compromise.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to win away the bulk of the masses, especially the revolutionary
  sectors, from the PCI without them first going through their own experience in this. It
  seems almost indispensable under present conditions. The sooner the PCI gets into
  office, the easier it will be to expose it to the masses in a revolutionary way.
  Agitation and propaganda at the present time must be directed to the masses in such a
  way that they understand that criticism of the PCI's historical compromise goes hand in
  hand with helping the masses go through the electoral experience, not obstructing
  it.</p>

  <p>The necessity of the masses going through the electoral experience of the historical
  compromise should be all the more understandable to genuine revolutionary elements in
  Italy precisely because the presentation of the historical compromise concept does not
  represent a sudden and violent breach by the PCI leaders from the past. Reformism has
  been the day-to-day practice of the PCI for decades and bourgeois parliamentarism with
  the aid of the PCI has sunk deep roots in the masses.</p>

  <p>It is not a situation where the leadership of a revolutionary working-class party
  has suddenly breached the revolutionary platform of the party.</p>

  <p>But the ascendancy of the PCI to official positions in a governing coalition with
  the bourgeoisie would accelerate the consciousness of the masses and quickly make it
  possible for them to judge, through their own experience, the sharp contrast between
  the promise and the performance of the PCI leaders in an increasingly aggravated social
  and political crisis.</p>

  <p>Of course, where working class revolutionary independents can make a race of it in
  specified localities, in such a way as to avoid causing the PCI to be defeated by a
  reactionary candidate because of revolutionary electoral intervention, it should be
  done.</p>

  <p>There is no question that a new chapter in the history of the embattled Italian
  proletariat is about to open. Italian monopoly capitalism, which has long avoided the
  formidable power of the workers, is not likely to escape a showdown this time.</p>
