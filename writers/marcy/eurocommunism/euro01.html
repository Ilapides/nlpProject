  <h1>The Italian CP and neo-ministerialism</h1>

  <h3>A note on the 'historic compromise'</h3>

  <h4>September 27, 1975</h4>A flurry was recently created in Washington when it was
  discovered that the Council on Foreign Relations, a prestigious Rockefeller dominion,
  had invited a representative of the Communist Party of Italy (PCI) to address it.

  <p>However, word was soon let out that the State Department was not yet ready to grant
  the PCI representative a visa. To avoid embarrassment both to itself and to Washington
  the PCI delayed making the necessary application for the visa.</p>

  <p><strong>Ruling class considering a coalition</strong></p>

  <p>This incident highlights the fact that a considerable section of the Italian ruling
  class, as well as some in the U.S., have long held under consideration the advisability
  of promoting a coalition government in Italy between the Christian Democrats and the
  PCI. The PCI leadership, on its part, has been pushing most vigorously and
  energetically to get such a coalition going, which it says would be a great "historic
  compromise."</p>

  <p>The idea has attracted wide attention and interest both in Europe and America. The
  PCI, it is said, now wields a lot of clout and prestige particularly since the recent
  election in which the Communists got more than 33 percent of the vote. The ruling
  Christian Democratic Party received barely more than a percentage point higher.</p>

  <p>This very large vote for the PCI has been the occasion for a flood of very laudatory
  articles about the party in the bourgeois press. It has especially been praised for the
  efficient manner in which it has conducted itself in regional governments under its
  control and in municipal affairs generally. But most of the articles have handed the
  PCI accolades and plaudits for its moderated course, for its efforts to become
  "respectable" and to have finally come "of age."</p>

  <p>The high command of the party, under the leadership of Enrico Berlinguer, has
  explained the party's great success by its ability to win the confidence of the masses.
  Most frequently the party's success is attributed by its leaders to wise political
  tactics, to their sagacity in political maneuvering with bourgeois parties, and most of
  all, to their flexible approach in winning the masses.</p>

  <p><strong>PCI lined up against Portuguese CP</strong></p>

  <p>The Italian CP it is said is free of that rigidity which characterizes other CPs
  such as the Portuguese party. The PCI leaders have skillfully utilized the recent
  reverses of the Portuguese CP (PCP), with whom they are sharply at odds, to ingratiate
  themselves with the Italian bourgeoisie as though to say, "See we are different."</p>

  <p>Alvaro Cunhal, the PCP leader, has roundly condemned the Italian CP, which is said
  to have more in common with the political approach of Mario Soares (the Portuguese
  Socialist Party leader) than with Cunhal.</p>

  <p>However that may be, and there is much to be said about the rapidly changing
  situation in Portugal, the Togliatti-Berlinguer strategy should be examined on its own
  merits, and independently of the Portuguese experience.</p>

  <p>The idea of a working class party participating in a bourgeois cabinet is certainly
  not a new one, no matter what new glittering name it is given. Practically since the
  beginning of the First International, the idea of a workers party taking a post in a
  capitalist cabinet as distinguished from election to a bourgeois parliament, has been
  considered unprincipled and a desertion to the camp of the class enemy.</p>

  <p><strong>Early Marxists scorned cabinet posts</strong></p>

  <p>During the days when the European working class was increasingly under Marxist
  influence, the idea of participating in a bourgeois cabinet was regarded with contempt
  and opprobrium, and Marxists &mdash; especially those of the German, Polish, French,
  and Russian Social Democratic parties, both before and after the split in 1903 &mdash;
  were the most scornful of the idea, which they saw as an expression of opportunism and
  rank class collaboration.</p>

  <p>But as the movement grew in breadth and scope, and as capitalism entered its phase
  of rapid, so-called "peaceful" development, opportunism as a social trend in the
  working class movement became formidable. Soon thereafter, it found its political and
  theoretical expression in Bernstein's famous revision of Marxism.</p>

  <p>However, by the turn of the century the Second International had truly become
  <strong>the</strong> representative of the international working class. It had grown by
  leaps and bounds, and was still to widen and deepen its influence in Europe, America,
  and Japan. In spite of the perilous growth of opportunism, the Marxist revolutionary
  element grew stronger and stronger. Its grip upon the advanced elements of the working
  class, especially in Germany, Austria, and France, was strong and profound, so that
  when the Second International of Social Democratic parties met in Paris in 1900, it
  passed a resolution roundly condemning the idea of any Social Democrat taking a cabinet
  post in a bourgeois government.</p>

  <p><strong>Denounced Millerand</strong></p>

  <p>The resolution was not introduced as an abstract exercise in Marxist strategy in the
  pursuit of the class struggle. It was purposely introduced to condemn a well-known
  French socialist leader, Alexandre Millerand, who took the post of Minister of Commerce
  in a bourgeois cabinet in 1899.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that a Social Democratic leader had done so. His action set
  off a violent controversy in the world socialist movement between the opportunist
  elements and the Marxists. Millerand's desertion was made all the more odious because
  he took a seat in the same cabinet with General Gallifet, the hangman of the Paris
  Commune. However, the resolution denouncing Millerand was not based on this aspect,
  which was regarded as incidental. Capitalist prime ministers often like to balance out
  their ministerial posts by allotting seats in the cabinet to one or two leftists in
  order to mask the class character of their regime.</p>

  <p>It was Karl Kautsky who framed the International's resolution, and it was
  characteristic of him that, in his conciliationist bent, he should leave some loophole
  in the area of what might be generally considered as valid exceptions. These were later
  used by opportunist elements to justify support of the imperialist war in 1914.
  Millerand himself was expelled from the French party in 1904, and thereafter turned
  more and more to the right, becoming an exponent of rabid reaction.</p>

  <p>It seems that from the time of Millerand, all who have entered bourgeois cabinets
  from working class parties have never resumed the revolutionary struggle against
  capitalism thereafter.</p>

  <p><strong>PCI calls it 'flexibility'</strong></p>

  <p>The PCI prides itself on its undoubted ability to employ sagacious political
  tactics, on its ability to maneuver with bourgeois political parties, on its readiness
  to employ flexibility in its approach to the masses, and on the need to understand
  changing concrete conditions which govern the day to day political situation in
  Italy.</p>

  <p>Leftist criticism of its political approach is often met with derision; the critics
  "fail to understand" the Italian people, whom they so well understand. This line of
  argument is utilized by the Italian CP leaders in the struggle against revolutionary
  elements who accuse them of abandoning the revolutionary struggle for socialism.</p>

  <p>It is startling, but nevertheless true, that the arguments employed by the Italian
  CP leaders are almost identical with the arguments presented by the right wing of the
  Socialist Party of Italy back in the pre-Mussolini days (1919 to 1923), when it was in
  the fold of the Communist International.</p>

  <p>Answering the right wing, Lenin stressed again and again at the Second Congress of
  the Communist International, during the discussion on the Italian question, that he had
  no objections at all to flexibility in tactics, to wise and sagacious maneuvers against
  bourgeois parties, or to taking account of the changing, concrete political situation
  in the country. The whole history of Bolshevism was a classic illustration of how all
  this was done.</p>

  <p>But one first of all had to separate all those for the proletarian revolution, for
  the seizure of power, for the dictatorship of the proletariat, for communism, from
  Turati and his followers, whom Lenin characterized as the Italian Mensheviks. These had
  to be fought and driven out of the Communist movement before one could talk about
  tactics or understanding a particular condition in the country.</p>

  <p>The whole story of Bolshevism, Lenin said, was a struggle against Menshevism, of
  which Turati was a clear-cut representative in Italy. Menshevism was an opportunist
  trend in the international labor movement and was characterized by class
  collaboration.</p>

  <p>Practically everything that Lenin said in condemnation of Turati could be said of
  Togliatti's and Berlinguer's conception of the struggle today &mdash; only the latter
  have a position more crass, more open, even more cynical.</p>

  <p>At one point in the discussion of the Italian question Lenin exclaimed in answer to
  Serrati, one of the Italian delegates who had raised the question of trying to
  understand the national psychology of the Italian people: "I wouldn't claim that I
  understand the psychology of the <strong>Russian</strong> people. One has to understand
  the differences in trends, and the difference between a reformist and a communist, the
  difference between the Italian Mensheviks and the Italian Communists."</p>

  <p><strong>Difference between cabinet and parliament</strong></p>

  <p>It has become a prevailing tactic in many of the revisionist CPs of the world to
  confuse the difference between the participation of a working class party in a
  bourgeois parliament, when that is proper, with participation of a working class party
  in a bourgeois cabinet.</p>

  <p>A working class party can participate in a bourgeois parliament, when appropriate,
  on a thoroughgoing revolutionary class struggle basis. Working class candidates elected
  to a bourgeois parliament or Congress are responsible only to the party. A working
  class representative is only obligated to utilize his or her seat in Congress or
  Parliament to mobilize the masses on a revolutionary class basis.</p>

  <p>He or she is obligated to utilize his or her post for extraparliamentary purposes
  and is free to vote for or against measures inasmuch as they advance the interests of
  the working class and oppressed. He or she is not obligated or beholden to the ruling
  class to do otherwise.</p>

  <p><strong>The cabinet: Executive committee of the ruling class</strong></p>

  <p>It is altogether different in joining a bourgeois cabinet. A working class
  representative who does so becomes responsible to the cabinet first. The position is
  always an <strong>appointed</strong> one &mdash; it's not an elected post. He or she
  must abide by the general discipline and general policy of the cabinet, which is the
  executive committee of the ruling class. A cabinet member must carry out executive
  orders. He or she takes orders either by majority cabinet decisions or more frequently
  by orders from the Premier or President.</p>

  <p>Of course, there is occasionally some limited latitude in carrying out the general
  policy of the ruling class. Sometimes there are differences. Often these differences
  are sharp and bitter. But, and this is the important thing, these are differences
  within the same class camp. Indeed, there may be hard liners, moderates, and liberals
  within the same cabinet. But it is a bourgeois cabinet, whose function is to carry out
  a policy which is irreconcilably opposed to the class interests of the workers and the
  oppressed.</p>

  <p>The transition from a parliamentary post, that is, an elective one, to that of an
  appointive cabinet level in a capitalist government, is deep and profound. For a
  working class party it means crossing class lines. It means going from the camp of the
  working class to the camp of the bourgeoisie. It's class betrayal. That's why the
  Second International more than 75 years ago clearly recognized the peril to a working
  class party in Millerand's case. And for that reason he was denounced as a renegade. It
  was really never a question at all among the solidly revolutionary Marxists of the day.
  The word Millerandism thereafter became a synonym for class treachery.</p>

  <p><strong>Historic exceptions:[1] Bavaria</strong></p>

  <p>The resolution passed by the Paris Congress in 1900 recognized certain exceptions to
  this. There are two examples which would illustrate the genuine exceptions for which
  the Congress voted and not the phony ones which were later used as a cover for class
  collaboration. For instance, on the heels of the great October Socialist Revolution,
  the Bavarian government in Germany was tottering and the possibility of a revolutionary
  takeover seemed imminent and practical. The Bavarian Communists thought it an opportune
  moment to take a cabinet post in the Bavarian government &mdash; that of Minister of
  Internal Affairs.</p>

  <p>The purpose was to <strong>facilitate the revolutionary seizure of power by the
  workers.</strong> The Minister of Internal Affairs could and in fact tried to
  <strong>distribute arms and ammunition to the workers in the imminent
  struggle.</strong> Unfortunately, as in most of the revolutionary struggles following
  the Russian revolution, the counter-revolution was triumphant.</p>

  <p><strong>[2] China in 1946</strong></p>

  <p>Another instance closer to the contemporary era was in 1946, when Secretary of State
  Marshall was sent by Truman to negotiate a coalition government between Chiang Kai-shek
  and the Chinese Communists. The Chinese Communists agreed to the negotiations and
  agreed in principle to join the coalition. However (and this is a point very much
  obscured in the post-liberation history of the Chinese revolution), the CCP made it a
  condition of the coalition that the PLA (Peoples Liberation Army) remained strictly
  under the jurisdiction and orders of the PLA military command.</p>

  <p>What this condition meant was that the coalition would merely be a cover for what
  were already two separate states, one an embryo workers' state, the other a bourgeois
  puppet regime. Chiang's jurisdiction was being severely limited anyway. Although he had
  a great number of arms under his control, the revolutionary resurgence in Chiang's own
  areas was such that accepting the CCP condition would have meant a disastrous
  acceleration of the disintegration of his armed forces, which was already in progress.
  Had the CCP leadership agreed to surrender jurisdiction over the PLA or hand it over to
  Chiang, that would of course have meant a capitulation to the compradore bourgeoisie
  and imperialism.</p>

  <p><strong>Millerandism reborn</strong></p>

  <p>It was the acceptance of precisely such a condition by the Italian and French CPs
  immediately after the end of the Second World War which spelled their complete
  renunciation of the revolutionary class struggle, when they had such a splendid
  opportunity to pursue it. Both the French and Italian CPs voluntarily liquidated their
  armed resistance movements in exchange for ministerial posts in a bourgeois imperialist
  cabinet.</p>

  <p>It was Millerandism reborn, and this time there was not the threadbare excuse of the
  danger of fascism which had been utilized to construct the Popular Fronts of the 1930s.
  Those were also betrayals of the working class. The CPs assumed ministerial posts in
  capitalist governments and were forced to carry out capitalist objectives: contain the
  revolutionary fervor of the masses, limit the workers' struggles so as not to go beyond
  the confines of bourgeois property relations, and curb the peasants from taking the
  land of the landlords. In a word, they enforced continuing capitalist exploitation.</p>

  <p>The Italian CP will, of course, not really be making a qualitative change in its
  political outlook by taking cabinet posts. Its parliamentary representatives today are
  practicing class collaboration with the Christian Democrats even without being given a
  cabinet post. Why then, are some sections of high finance and industry in this country
  and Italy so fearful of according the PCI the responsibility of "sharing power" with
  the bourgeois Christian Democrats?</p>

  <p>Of course, it's not sharing of power. By sharing the administration of power on
  behalf of the bourgeoisie, the latter-day Millerands will merely be office holders,
  <strong>not power holders.</strong> State power consists of the armed forces, the
  police, the courts, and all the other repressive forces which make up the capitalist
  state. These are solidly in the hands of the bourgeoisie. The Italian CP liquidated the
  old resistance movement and is by no means building a new one.</p>

  <p><strong>What imperialists fear</strong></p>

  <p>The ruling circles in the Pentagon and State Department fear that the consummation
  of a so-called historic compromise might impel the resurgent, confident popular masses
  <strong>to go beyond the limits of bourgeois legality, and commence to take things into
  their own hands.</strong></p>

  <p>Isn't this really what has terrified the European and American capitalists about
  Portugal? Isn't it because the workers began to take things into their own hands,
  taking over factories, mills, and landed estates, that a revolutionary situation exists
  in Portugal?</p>

  <p>Isn't it these measures of workers' control, <strong>which became
  nationwide,</strong> that so frightened large sections of the Portuguese possessing
  class with the revolutionary energy and resistance of the masses that they had to flee,
  some without their bank accounts? And isn't this what has roused the world
  bourgeoisie?</p>

  <p>This is exactly what worries the bourgeoisie about the historic compromise! Both
  Washington and Rome worry whether the PCI leaders <strong>will be able</strong> to
  control the masses, in the aftermath of the consummation of the historic
  compromise.</p>

  <p><strong>Opportunity for revolutionary elements</strong></p>

  <p>For our part, we can only hope that the Italian ruling class, which is reeling under
  an economic crisis more severe with each passing day, will eventually be forced to
  accede to the offers of the PCI. Once that is done, the greatest opportunity in more
  than a quarter of a century will be open for the revolutionary elements to lead the
  masses in the absolutely inevitable revolutionary upsurge.</p>

  <p>The Italian proletariat has twice during the century allowed a genuinely
  revolutionary crisis of the capitalist system to elude it. The first was during the
  1919-1923 period, when the reformists were far stronger than the revolutionary elements
  led by the communists. And the communists were immature at the time. And second, when
  following the defeat of the fascist regime, the PCI willingly liquidated the partisan
  movement and traded it in for a ministerial post à la Millerand.</p>

  <p>Every progressive, every class-conscious worker, every communist and genuine
  socialist must hope that this time around the proletariat will emerge victorious.</p>
