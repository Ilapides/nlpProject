  <h1>Shevardnadze in Romania</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Jan. 18, 1990)</h5>

  <p>January 10 &mdash; On Jan. 6, Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, made
  a visit to Romania. He arrived at a time when in Bucharest particularly there is a
  violent witch hunt against communists and progressives that puts into the shade the
  McCarthyite era we are all familiar with in the U.S. [As we go to press, New York's
  WINS radio is reporting the lynching of communists in the streets of Bucharest &mdash;
  ed.]</p>

  <p>First of all, the entire membership of the Romanian CP Politburo, 35 in all, are
  under lock and key in unidentified jails. No one has been permitted to visit them.
  Interviews with friends or family, if they are taking place, have not been reported. A
  number of summary trials are the order of the day. How many have been executed has not
  been revealed.</p>

  <p>No public trials, no charges filed, no interviews, no public participation, no
  indication as to when or how any of the communists or their sympathizers are being
  treated, in or out of jail.</p>

  <p>It is said that thousands of rank-and-file communists are either hiding or keeping
  themselves out of public view, and that most are being hunted by army-sponsored
  so-called "citizens' committees."</p>

  <h4>What happened to socialist solidarity?</h4>

  <p>Shevardnadze, the second-ranking representative of the USSR and a member of the
  Politburo, is bound to know personally at least some of the Romanian Politburo members.
  After all, they have met innumerable times in exchanges between their respective
  parties &mdash; a normal procedure in what have until now been called fraternal
  socialist or communist relationships.</p>

  <p>Each regarded the other as a fraternal Communist party. Each was seen as part of the
  socialist camp, bound by socialist solidarity. They shared membership in a common trade
  and economic organization, Comecon or the CMEA.</p>

  <p>Differences, some of a deep-going character, have characterized a number of the
  countries in Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, certain norms of political conduct
  characteristic of Communist parties and their respective socialist governments did
  prevail.</p>

  <p>For instance, all have had at least a pro forma position against capitalism and
  imperialism and in support of national liberation movements. Also, each had committed
  themselves to the so-called Helsinki group, which is supposed to validate the security
  arrangements agreed upon at Potsdam and Yalta. The imperialists also insisted that this
  group oversee what they called human rights conduct in both West and East Europe.</p>

  <p>Shouldn't Shevardnadze's first concern upon arrival in Bucharest have been to
  inquire directly about his fellow communists, now incarcerated in unknown jails? Was it
  not his duty to demand to visit them, and to inquire of them directly as to what had
  transpired? How it happened that the Ceausescus were assassinated, and that they found
  themselves behind bars?</p>

  <h4>How imperialists treat their own</h4>

  <p>When former U.S. president Ronald Reagan arrived in Moscow on his first visit,
  didn't he publicly first concern himself with Andrei Sakharov, the now-deceased titular
  leader of the bourgeois opposition in the USSR? Haven't the Nixons, the Carters, the
  Thatchers, Kohls and Mitterrands, in fact all imperialist statesmen, always made that
  their first preoccupation to inquire about the bourgeois opposition, the so-called
  dissidents?</p>

  <p>Of course, the imperialist bourgeoisie evaluate these dissidents differently. A
  conservative bourgeois like Sakharov might prove more useful than a Solzhenitsyn, who
  was straight out for the restoration not just of the bourgeoisie but of the czarist
  monarchy. Boris Yeltsin is another story; he doesn't seem to know what camp he belongs
  to.</p>

  <p>But while their evaluations may differ, the imperialist bourgeoisie are nevertheless
  absolutely unanimous in defending the right-wing opposition, whether they be in the
  USSR or any other socialist country, like Cuba, China, or others.</p>

  <p>Shevardnadze, however, instead of addressing himself to the raging witch hunt and
  the anticommunist atmosphere, found the atmosphere in Bucharest "absolutely purified."
  These incredible words come out of the mouth of a fellow Politburo member, not from
  some distant country but right on Romania's doorstep. What a stark contrast to the
  honest statement from far-off People's Laos that 1989 introduced not a purified
  atmosphere but "a nightmare for socialism."</p>

  <h4>Just an internal matter?</h4>

  <p>Shevardnadze also said, "What political parties will lead Romania is the business of
  Romanians themselves." Really? Doesn't it matter whether they are fascist or communist?
  He goes on to say, "We will always obey the will of the people." But the people,
  depending on the class character of society, are divided into antagonistic classes
  which are represented by different parties.</p>

  <p>Is this coming out of the mouth of a communist statesman, or is this the
  garden-variety type of imperialist diplomatic double-talk? How can it possibly be of
  the slightest help or enlightenment to the workers anywhere in the world?</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it's precisely the rank interference of the Gorbachev leadership that
  has helped push Poland and Hungary into the camp of the imperialist bourgeoisie. It in
  fact overthrew the old leadership of the German Democratic Republic. By trying to force
  the GDR to accept the so-called perestroika reforms, which are anti-socialist in
  character, it is risking the dismantling of socialist East Germany all together and its
  assimilation by the imperialist West.</p>

  <p>Now Shevardnadze says it's the business of the Romanians to decide what political
  parties will lead them. But the most significant factor in the overthrow of the
  Ceausescu regime was that it had chosen a different road from Moscow and opposed the
  bourgeois reforms.</p>

  <h4>The odor of imperialist diplomacy</h4>

  <p>But this is only part of Shevardnadze's sermon. "I can tell you sincerely that after
  meeting with Ceausescu, I always came back to my country with unpleasant feelings."
  That's not what you said earlier when you met with Ceausescu! You embraced each other
  cordially before a worldwide audience. You were greeted with dignity and friendship on
  you arrival. You walked side by side with Ceausescu, along row upon row of soldiers and
  civilians, hundreds of thousands of them, who waved and threw flowers. And there were
  mutual exchanges between you and Ceausescu which showed not only friendship but
  amiability.</p>

  <p>Was all this just a fraud? The kind of diplomacy so in disrepute during the Leninist
  period? Was it a charade, where appearances do not conform to reality, so that the
  masses are continually deceived and stupefied?</p>

  <p>It is to be noticed that since the overthrown of the Ceausescu government, the
  imperialists have been falling all over each other to extend diplomatic relations to
  this "great revolution." And that the USSR has followed suit.</p>

  <h4>Since when do imperialists recognize a real revolution?</h4>

  <p>What a sharp contrast to the dilatory tactics of the bourgeoisie in extending
  recognition when a revolution is in fact a real revolution! The Cuban Revolution, over
  30 years old, is still waiting for the quarantine and blockade to be lifted, let alone
  recognition. China too waited 30 years. The USSR itself was recognized by the U.S. only
  in 1934 and then, confessed John Foster Dulles, later secretary of state, only because
  of the rise of fascist Japan and Nazi Germany.</p>

  <p>One can extend diplomatic relations merely as a way of maintaining commercial and
  diplomatic ties. That can be understood. It is another thing entirely to turn your back
  on fellow communists and, in full view of the world, praise their executioners.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Shevardnadze's indecent haste to extend economic and political aid and
  commercial deals shows that he and his grouping are in a hurry to curry favor with the
  new bourgeois regime, as though that alone will facilitate a friendly attitude toward
  the USSR from these dregs of bourgeois reaction. The entire political makeup of these
  anti-communist military conspirators is clearly in the direction of Western
  imperialism, particularly West Germany, France and the U.S.</p>

  <h4>French bourgeoisie doubtful</h4>

  <p>The Paris bourgeois daily Le Monde in a Jan. 9 report from Bucharest described
  Shevardnadze's last press conference in Romania. Surrounded by military guards, he was
  asked by the new foreign minister, Sergiu Celac, to repeat his earlier statement that
  "The Soviet government did not have the least contact with the Council of National
  Salvation before Dec. 22, since the former did not exist." Evidently, Celac was just a
  bit too eager to establish the new regime's legitimacy.</p>

  <p>Commented Le Monde: "Curious, curious. Like the best diplomats &mdash; Mr. Celac is
  an excellent one &mdash; they stumble sometimes. In looking to prove too much, they
  reinforce doubt."</p>

  <p>Clearly what Le Monde is referring to is the widely held knowledge, which
  Shevardnadze could not dispel, that in fact the so-called Council of National Salvation
  had been plotting for months, with the knowledge of the Soviet government as well as
  the West. Le Monde's candor is undoubtedly a reflection of the French bourgeoisie's
  rancor at the fact that, despite their "special historical relationship" with Romania,
  it is the U.S. imperialists who now have the inside track with the military
  camarilla.</p>

  <h4>Shevardnadze on democracy and dictatorship</h4>

  <p>But all this is not the worst of it. We have to consider the main point made by
  Shevardnadze. It can only be regarded as a staggering blow to all communists who regard
  the Soviet Union as a socialist or workers' state, in fact, to all who share a common
  view of the teachings of Marx and Engels, as later developed by Lenin.</p>

  <p>Shevardnadze has thrown upon the world movement a concept of the relationship
  between bourgeois democracy and dictatorship vehemently rejected by Marx more than a
  century ago, and which Lenin relentlessly exposed in all his writings. These classics
  of Marxism (such as <em>State and Revolution</em> and <em>The Proletarian Revolution
  and the Renegade Kautsky</em>) are to this day textbooks of Marxism, not only in the
  USSR but in the world communist movement.</p>

  <p>"We do not accept dictatorship," Shevardnadze said. "Dictatorship cannot be
  accepted, not a Communist one nor a bourgeois one."</p>

  <p>Was not the Bolshevik government a dictatorship of the proletariat in alliance with
  the peasantry? Was not the Paris Commune, as Marx and Engels explained, a dictatorship
  of the proletariat? What is the class character of the USSR? A nonclass government?
  Isn't it a class dictatorship of the proletariat? Or has the dictatorship of the
  proletariat been liquidated into a bourgeois state, with bourgeois democratic
  trappings?</p>

  <p>Can one really say, in the light of Shevardnadze's new wisdom, that the Soviet Union
  is a workers' state, a dictatorship of the proletariat in alliance with the peasants
  and the intelligentsia? Or has it ceased to have a class character altogether?</p>

  <p>Then what is the meaning of the new bourgeois opposition, which continually grows
  and is strongly represented in the Soviet parliament?</p>

  <p>Since Shevardnadze was in Bucharest talking about dictatorship and democracy, what
  is the class character of the new regime there? Isn't it a bourgeois dictatorship which
  mouths democratic slogans but in fact is ruled by a military camarilla which is openly
  pro-West? Four generals are now among the cabinet ministers (New York Times, Jan.
  1).</p>

  <p>Is everything Marx, Engels and Lenin taught about in relationship to democracy and
  dictatorship to be thrown overboard in favor of a bourgeois concept which lumps all
  democracies together, hiding the dictatorship of monopoly capitalism and denigrating,
  vilifying, slandering and where possible subverting and attempting to overthrow the
  dictatorship of the proletariat?</p>

  <p>Let's go back to the ABCs of Marxism on this.</p>

  <h4>Political form vs. class essence</h4>

  <p>Marxists have never confused the <strong>political form</strong> of class rule with
  the <strong>essence</strong> of class rule: who own the means of production, who are
  the exploiters and who the exploited. One of the elementary propositions of Marxism is
  that before we examine the political form of a state, whether it be democratic,
  monarchical, military or fascist, we must first of all ask, what are the property
  relations? The political forms are subordinate to the class essence of a state. And the
  very existence of a state proves that society is divided into antagonistic classes, one
  of which is exercising its dictatorship over the others.</p>

  <p>In Romania, before the change to socialized property, there were a variety of forms
  of the state &mdash; fascist, royalist, military &mdash; but all of them were based
  upon the rule of the landlords and the capitalists. Even if King Michael or King Carol
  had a democratic, parliamentary form of government, they were beholden to the landlords
  and the propertied classes, the bourgeoisie. It was a bourgeois, exploitative state.
  The overthrow of these regimes, and the expropriation of the landowners and the
  capitalists &mdash; in Marx's words, the expropriation of the expropriators &mdash; was
  not this the essence of the establishment of a dictatorship of the proletariat?</p>

  <p>Whatever political form it took in Romania or elsewhere, the expropriation of the
  expropriators established the dictatorship of the proletariat in alliance with the
  peasants and all the poor, propertyless masses.</p>

  <p>In his <em>Critique of the Gotha Program,</em> Marx wrote that "Between capitalist
  and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one
  into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which
  the state can be nothing but <strong>the revolutionary dictatorship of the
  proletariat."</strong> (Marx and Engels' <em>Selected Works,</em> Vol. 3, p. 26.)</p>

  <p>If the bourgeoisie were agreeable to a change of fundamental property relations, to
  a change from its dictatorship of the proletariat, there's no question that the form of
  the dictatorship of the proletariat would be a hundred times more democratic than any
  bourgeois democracy could ever be.</p>

  <h4>Isn't a workers' dictatorship preferable to a bourgeois dictatorship?</h4>

  <p>Isn't a workers' government, a dictatorship of the proletariat, even if it is
  conducted in the most absolutist and autocratic manner, still preferable to the
  autocratic, exploitative rule of the tiny minority that are the landlords and the
  bourgeoisie? Isn't this the fundamental question that is being raised now?</p>

  <p>The Ceausescu regime was a proletarian dictatorship, was it not? It expropriated the
  landlords and the bourgeoisie. Even today, all the basic facilities are in the hands of
  the government, and education up to the university level was universally free. This is
  despite its exigencies, its forays in diplomacy and wanderings into the imperialist
  orbit and then back again, wanderings which have also been characteristic of larger
  socialist states, such as China &mdash; which has learned how dangerous this could
  be.</p>

  <p>Isn't Shevardnadze saying that because of the political form of the proletarian
  dictatorship during the Ceausescu period, it is preferable to have a bourgeois regime?
  Which, in Marxist terms, means a bourgeois dictatorship?</p>

  <h4>Democracy and a workers' dictatorship</h4>

  <p>Marx predicted that the dictatorship of the proletariat on a world scale would last
  for a prolonged period. This entails different forms of the class dictatorship, given a
  world social environment in which the leading imperialist predatory powers still
  control most of the economic arteries and have had an industrial and technological lead
  prepared for by centuries of exploitation of the working class and oppressed
  masses.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie has different forms of its dictatorship, some milder, some harsher
  in their repression of the masses. Can it be expected that a proletarian dictatorship
  in an undeveloped country, surrounded by imperialist powers which have more than once
  drowned them in a world war, will have a pure democracy?</p>

  <p>Can one demand, for instance, that there be pure, unhindered, absolute democracy in
  Nicaragua? Would the imperialist U.S. sit idly by and watch the experiment without
  interfering? Can we possibly close our eyes to what has been going on in Nicaragua for
  ten years &mdash; sabotage, wrecking, sponsorship of military aggression through hired
  mercenaries? Isn't that what happened in the first ten years of the Soviet republic as
  well? And in the People's Republic of China? And what about the merciless wars of
  imperialism against Korea and Vietnam?</p>

  <p>It doesn't even have to be a socialist country. Defiance of imperialism brings down
  the full weight of the U.S. military juggernaut, as has been seen in Grenada and now
  Panama and Colombia.</p>

  <p>A country that struggles to survive against imperialist pressure over an extended
  period cannot be expected to be fully socialist, especially while the imperialist
  colossus continues to grow and fatten at the expense of undeveloped countries, and the
  superprofits extracted from them are utilized to support counterrevolution.</p>

  <p>How democratic the proletarian dictatorship can be depends on external circumstances
  of imperialist aggression and penetration, and whether the remaining expropriated
  classes will abide by socialist legality. Will they abide by socialist democracy, or
  will they, with aid and comfort and funds from abroad, attempt a comeback? Certainly,
  this is what is now happening in Romania.</p>
