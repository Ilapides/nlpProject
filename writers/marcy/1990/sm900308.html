  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: The crucial question in Nicaragua (March 8,

<body>
  <h1>The crucial question in Nicaragua</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 8, 1990)</h5>

  <p>February 28 &mdash; Probably one of the most important questions connected to the
  election in Nicaragua concerns the so-called UNO coalition headed by Violeta Chamorro.
  It would be one thing if it were <strong>secretly</strong> financed by the U.S. But
  this is not the case. The U.S. government has openly boasted about financing the UNO
  campaign lock, stock and barrel, without obstruction of any type.</p>

  <p>Is there any historical analogy to this most outlandish, cynical and outright
  reactionary form of parliamentarism?</p>

  <p>There have been elections in Western Europe, say, where the U.S. CIA funneled in
  money secretly, to what extent no one knows even to this day. But in Nicaragua it has
  made no effort to conceal its intervention. The U.S. imperialist government, which has
  conducted a most merciless, ruthless and predatory war against the people since the
  triumph of the revolution, suddenly decided it would carry on the same level of warfare
  by a different method. The object remained the same: the domination of the country by
  U.S. finance capital.</p>

  <p>Of course many workers and peasants wanted an end to the war, which like every war
  brings devastation, hunger and inflation. All the imperialist-Chamorro coalition had to
  do was feed on this.</p>

  <h4>A fair election under conditions of blockade and war?</h4>

  <p>We have to pause for a minute and ask: Can an election be really and truly
  representative under such conditions? Has there ever before been a government so
  arrogant as to actually carry out a ten-year war against a small country and then
  openly finance its collaborators in what is called an election?</p>

  <p>Should an election be permitted by a revolutionary government at a time when it has
  sustained the most barbarous blockade, sabotage, plunder and outright attempts to
  starve the population to death? Can that be a fair election?</p>

  <p>Would George Washington have called for an election between the Loyalists and the
  Revolutionary Army during the bleak days of Valley Forge?</p>

  <p>Can any population sustain itself indefinitely that is subjected to continued
  bombardment, not merely by helicopter gunships and missiles, but by a quarantine of the
  country that has made it impossible to conduct regular commercial and economic
  intercourse with the rest of the world? Should an election have taken place without
  there first being a lifting of the blockade, the cruelty of which has been unanimously
  condemned by world public opinion?</p>

  <p>Shouldn't one of the principal conditions of an election have been compensation from
  the U.S. so that, after the incalculable damage it has done to the country, there could
  be reconstruction and the restoration of a modicum of normality?</p>

  <p>The problem lies not so much in having agreed to an election as in characterizing
  the election as a free and fair one. This means accepting lock, stock and barrel the
  imperialist version of the election. It agrees with imperialism on the role of
  bourgeois parliamentarism and subjects the masses to this ideological banality.</p>

  <p>But these matters are so well known. Need we go over them again and again? Merely to
  do that is to avoid the central question that faces the Nicaraguan government and
  people. It is the relation of bourgeois parliamentarism to state power. This is what
  the leading cadres of the revolution, what all militant, class-conscious workers and
  peasants are now thinking about.</p>

  <h4>Parliamentarism and the state</h4>

  <p>What is the significance of a parliamentary system in relation to state power? We
  now have a new governing group whose leaders proclaim themselves head of the state.
  This in turn really raises the crux of the issue that the Sandinista leadership has to
  face. What is the state? It is not an academic question.</p>

  <p>"An army is a state on wheels." This superb generalization was made by one of the
  truly great military strategists who himself led a revolutionary army &mdash; Napoleon
  Bonaparte. He knew what the essence of the state is. It is an army. The army could be
  on foot or on wheels, but it is the very quintessence of the state.</p>

  <p>Napoleon knew this from experience. He led a revolutionary army composed of
  basically peasant masses on behalf of the new bourgeois order, and they defeated the
  feudal armies of Eastern Europe. In his day, the heyday of the bourgeoisie, his army
  was a people's army.</p>

  <p>"An army is a state on wheels." This is also the basis of Frederick Engels's great
  classic, <em>The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State</em>. Engels
  dwelt in considerable detail on the origin of the state, specifically emphasizing that
  it is in essence a body of armed men, the skeletal form of all class society, and that
  it arises in social evolution only when class antagonisms have developed.</p>

  <p>Do all societies have a state? No. There have been societies with governing groups
  but no state. Lewis Henry Morgan, who observed Native societies in North America in the
  mid-19th century, showed that they had no state but did have democratic bodies that
  governed the nation or confederation of nations. Since then anthropologists have
  written of similar societies in all parts of the world. The distinction between
  governing groups and the state is a very clear one, but is blurred by bourgeois
  sociology.</p>

  <p>In some modern capitalist countries like Italy, France or England, there have been a
  considerable number of governing groups. In Italy, for instance, there have been as
  many as 35 different governments and coalitions in the post-war period. But there has
  been only one state, the state of the bourgeoisie. Its essence is the body of armed men
  and women &mdash; the police, the secret services, the army and other repressive
  services &mdash; that hold the masses in tow.</p>

  <p>Regardless of what parliamentary group is in charge, the same is true of England.
  For instance, after many Conservative governments, a popular majority of workers
  elected a Labor Party government in 1945. But the state remained fundamentally the
  same: the state of the bourgeoisie, propped up by a most powerful army, police and
  secret service which reach out to the four corners of the globe. This armed body of men
  and women has the power to suppress any opposition coming from the oppressed peoples
  and the workers, be it in Ireland, the Indian subcontinent or South America.</p>

  <h4>Somoza and the state</h4>

  <p>It is this very clear demarcation between the state and the parliamentary governing
  group, the product of bourgeois parliamentarism, that is the central issue facing
  Nicaragua today. Before the revolution, the ruling group in Nicaragua was the Somoza
  family. They ruled over the country with blood and iron. How were they able to do so?
  Because this governing family clique was based on a body of armed men whose essence was
  the suppression of the peasants and workers. In turn, it was completely supported by
  U.S. imperialism.</p>

  <p>The Somoza grouping could not have lasted in power unless the state in its skeleton
  form was a body for the ruthless, merciless repression and destruction of human life.
  That body of armed men, supported not only by wheels but by aircraft and even missiles,
  was called the National Guard, but was in reality a military prop indispensable to
  state rule at home and supported financially and militarily from abroad.</p>

  <p>Such a situation could have continued, but the revolution intervened. How was the
  Somoza governing clique overthrown? Was it a peaceful takeover of the state regime and
  the National Guard, subjecting them to the orders of the new revolutionary grouping? Or
  was the revolution the product of the development of a people's army, of the armed
  might of the people, of the mass of the workers and peasants?</p>

  <p>No parliamentary election could possibly have subjected the hated, brutal National
  Guard to the will of the people. That is not what dissolved its reactionary essence;
  that is not how a democratic people's army was established. It hasn't happened that way
  anywhere.</p>

  <h4>Destruction of the National Guard</h4>

  <p>What happened was the violent overthrow of the governing clique and the virtual
  destruction of the National Guard. As Engels, Marx and later Lenin formulate it, it was
  the destruction of the old state apparatus and its replacement by an army based on the
  popular masses, the workers and the peasants.</p>

  <p>Was this an accidental phenomenon? A fortuitous combination of unusual circumstances
  away from the high road of historic development? No, it was not. Bearing in mind
  modifications in each historical circumstance, the establishment of a people's army
  with its own governing group is what happened in Cuba, Vietnam, Korea, and certainly of
  course in China and in the great classical proletarian revolution in Russia.</p>

  <p>The driving forces culminating in the victory of the Nicaraguan Revolution were a
  variation of what the 20th century has been all about &mdash; the destruction of the
  old, repressive states, based upon exploitation and oppression by bourgeois-landlord
  property-owning classes, and the passage of power to the propertyless. This new
  phenomenon has galled the imperialist bourgeoisie worldwide.</p>

  <p>Despite both victories and defeats over the decades, the revolutionary struggle has
  again and again proven its viability as destructive, outmoded, capitalist private
  property relationships become more and more untenable in a world where the collective
  labor of the masses seeks to assert itself over the idlers, those who appropriate what
  the masses produce.</p>

  <p>None of the great revolutions of this century could possibly have succeeded without
  the destruction of the old state apparatus, the military apparatus of the landlords and
  the industrialists, especially the foreign-owned transnational corporations. And none
  of them could have lasted for longer than a few weeks or months had they not erected
  and developed over a period of time a people's armed force to, in Marx's classic
  terminology, destroy the old state apparatus and erect one on a new foundation.</p>

  <h4>Political institutions of the state</h4>

  <p>It would of course be a crude error to assume that the state is only a body of armed
  men and women. It was not so even during Napoleon's time. The state is also a complex
  of social and political institutions which not only buttress the armed might of the
  state but in a hundred and one ways serve the state and enable it to rule over society
  as a whole.</p>

  <p>But to get back to Nicaragua. The revolutionary state is not only the people's army;
  it is also a complex of progressive social and political institutions built up under
  the most trying circumstances amidst war, ruin and destruction. However brutally it has
  been attacked, damaged and in part destroyed, it has survived and is the very essence
  of the revolution. The armed forces and the progressive social and political
  institutions that the revolution has created may only be rudimentary, but they have
  shown great promise of what they could do if allowed to develop without ruin and
  devastation, hunger and blockade.</p>

  <p>And what do we face now? A new and utterly contradictory phenomenon as a result of
  an electoral process that is in reality a parliamentary trick. A new governing group,
  wholly financed by the U.S., militarily supported by the Pentagon, now seeks to lay
  hands on the greatest achievement of the revolution &mdash; not only the armed forces
  as such but also the progressive institutions that have been part and parcel of the
  people's social and political achievements. True, they were in their infancy and had
  only begun to develop. But they showed promise of movement in a progressive direction,
  away from the old, outmoded social and property relations.</p>

  <h4>Can mercenaries be allowed to take over the state?</h4>

  <p>The question now is, should the revolutionary state allow this mercenary grouping to
  take it over and make it conform over a period of time to the new state form? It is in
  essence the state of the peasants and workers. Should they allow their institutions to
  be liquidated, subverted and destroyed in the interest of greedy imperialist
  monopolies?</p>

  <p>One may ask, would an exploiting class like the bourgeoisie or the feudal lords or
  the slaveowners of ancient as well as modern times ever allow a new ruling group to win
  an electoral victory and take over their state, liquidate it and set up a new state of
  the oppressed, of peasants, of freed slaves, of workers? Where in history has there
  ever been even one single, solitary example of this having occurred?</p>

  <p>But the question also goes beyond the theoretical sphere. To say that the forces of
  reaction in Nicaragua can do this because they won a fair election that expresses the
  will of the people is to do violence to fact. What is the meaning of fairness? Fairness
  is a vague generalization. It covers over a multitude of contradictions and
  misconceptions. But what is involved here is politics, what is involved is the
  political condition of the masses, worn and weary, battered but not beaten. To talk of
  fairness under these conditions is altogether out of the sphere of reality.</p>

  <p>Was not the Allende election a fair one, to use the current terminology? Did the
  imperialist bourgeoisie allow that fair election to run its course? The Popular Unity
  had merely set itself the task of democratic reform and social progress. It had not
  even addressed the question of dissolving or liquidating the old state apparatus. It
  had not set up even the embryo of its own people's army. And yet the imperialist
  bourgeoisie were so terrified that they opened a reign of terror to destroy the Allende
  regime that was way out of proportion, considering it had merely sought the democratic
  reform of bourgeois institutions.</p>

  <p>Do we really have to go into all this at the end of the 20th century, after so much
  rich and varied experience of the relationship between bourgeois parliamentarism and
  state power? Do we need yet another tragic and costly experience in the destruction of
  human life and material resources to confirm the difference between a governing group
  and state power? Is that not the prospect in Nicaragua?</p>

  <p>Most of the advanced workers and peasants, the popular masses who worked and
  sacrificed in the interest of the revolution, clearly recognize the danger to which all
  are now exposed. They must be saying to themselves, "We have allowed a group of wolves
  into our den who will surely devour us."</p>

  <h4>A retreat vs. a surrender</h4>

  <p>It was one thing for the Sandinista leadership to allow the enemy to wrest one
  concession after another in the course of a long and cruel war. That can easily be
  understood in a common-sense way by every worker and every peasant who has lived and
  suffered through the revolution and the war and understands the nature of the enemy.
  But all these concessions, and they are numerous, were allowed because it held out the
  hope of securing and ultimately strengthening the revolution.</p>

  <p>Lenin in his time made many such concessions, most notably the ceding of much
  territory and material resources as well as people to the imperialist brigands of
  Germany during the First World War. But he called this very serious concession a
  retreat, said it was forced upon us by robbers who had a gun in their hand pointed at
  our heads. And he along with the Bolsheviks hoped that in the course of time this
  concession would fortify and strengthen the revolution so that finally the concessions
  would be reversed.</p>

  <p>He called things by their right name, not confusing what must be given away with a
  gain. He did not call a retreat an advance; that would deceive and disorient the
  workers.</p>

  <p>In the course of a long war mistakes can be made with respect to one or even a
  multitude of concessions. But it is altogether a different matter to surrender a
  revolution that was "won in blood," as President Ortega so well put it in his address
  on Feb. 26. To surrender the revolution in the interest of an electoral gimmick is the
  height of folly.</p>

  <p>The U.S. may replace for a time the open, unconcealed colonialism that prevailed
  earlier with a neocolonial imperialism which is just as brutal and just as destructive.
  The difference is one of form, for the essence of it is undisguised colonial oppression
  and exploitation.</p>

  <p>To surrender the revolution in the name of the democratic electoral process is the
  height of what Marx called bourgeois parliamentary cretinism. It is to sell one's
  birthright for a mess of pottage. This is what has to be pondered now.</p>

  <p>Surely there will be a flow of funds from the U.S. Surely the pockets of the new
  ruling group will be filled and the coffers of the various cliques will get the
  payments due from their masters in Washington and in Wall Street.</p>

  <p>This is the time of decision for the revolutionary cadre. It will take a great deal
  of tactical and strategic thinking, especially when one considers the enormous task at
  hand.</p>

  <h4>The `kiss and make up' transition</h4>

  <p>Everyone has seen the photograph of President Ortega embracing and congratulating
  Chamorro on the UNO victory. Difficult as it is for revolutionary workers, peasants and
  even leaders to watch this, its significance should not in and of itself be overdrawn.
  There are historical precedents, times when what appeared to be idyllic reconciliations
  between opposing class camps took place. But the irreconcilable class antagonisms
  overrode them.</p>

  <p>A relevant example took place on the vast political landscape of China in 1946.
  Immediately after the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the U.S. felt it had laid
  the basis for the pacification of Asia, that is, for it to assert its domination not
  only as against Japan but also as against Britain, France, Holland and the other
  colonial powers. U.S. imperialism also felt its hands were freed in Europe with the
  defeat of the Nazis, and that a large section of U.S. troops could now be transferred
  to the Asian theater.</p>

  <p>China, where the revolutionary forces under the leadership of the Communist Party
  and the Peoples Liberation Army had been growing since the 1930s, was seen as the last
  obstacle to a Pax Americana in the Pacific. So the Truman administration dispatched its
  soldier-statesman of the time, General George C. Marshall, to make a last-ditch effort
  to unite what they called the two warring factions into one Chinese government and
  army.</p>

  <p>Thus a friendly negotiating session was set up between the PLA and the CP leaders on
  one side, and the leaders of the pro-imperialist Kuomintang, including Generalissimo
  Chiang Kai-shek himself. The issue was how to combine the two armies into one under
  civilian leadership (Kuomintang and CP).</p>

  <p>It appeared for a while, especially when judged by the communiques and the friendly,
  fraternal atmosphere prevailing &mdash; each side referring to the other as brothers
  and discussing their common desire to at last end the fratricidal struggle and
  establish a united China &mdash; that the wide chasm between the two camps, which were
  sociologically based on antagonistic class forces, was now being bridged by careful
  diplomacy.</p>

  <p>But what happened? After a number of fruitless sessions of trying to bridge the
  class camps, the meetings were adjourned with a vague reference to resuming at a later
  date. The whole world knows what followed. Notwithstanding the bulldozing and atomic
  brinkmanship of U.S. imperialism, the Chinese Red Army launched a mighty offensive and
  swept the Chiang Kai-shek forces into the sea, where they took refuge in the island
  province of Taiwan.</p>

  <p>There is, however, one fundamental difference between this situation and the current
  events in Nicaragua. With all the talk in the Chinese discussions about democracy and
  having elections for a single parliament, that never took place. The Chinese Communist
  leaders never agreed to hold any such elections. When the time was ripe,
  notwithstanding the threatening international stance of the U.S., the Kuomintang was
  swept off the mainland.</p>

  <p>In Nicaragua the revolutionary government agreed to conduct an election. Moreover,
  it agreed with the imperialist version of the elections as fair and free. But has this
  closed the yawning gap between the two class camps? Is there any real possibility that
  the class struggle and the anti-imperialist struggle can be liquidated under these
  circumstances without a revolutionary offensive against the pro-imperialist
  bourgeoisie?</p>

  <p>Unlike the Chinese CP leadership, the Sandinista leaders have bound themselves, at
  least in legal and technical terms, to subject the armed forces and the progressive
  social and political institutions to the direction of the bourgeoisie. The massive
  demonstration held Feb. 27 in Managua, where the leadership pledged to retain the
  revolutionary gains and received the applause of the masses, seems more calculated to
  lay the basis for a legal opposition to the pro-imperialist ruling clique than to
  prepare resistance to it.</p>

  <p>Of course, it is quite understandable that, in what is being called the transition
  period, when the government has pledged itself to legality at any cost, it is necessary
  to carefully maneuver to some extent. But it has to be made crystal clear to the masses
  that <strong>UNO is not a legitimate government. It is propped up, supported, financed
  and controlled by a foreign imperialist power. It has no legitimacy, no legality, no
  constitutional basis for governing, precisely because it is an entity controlled by
  foreign finance capital.</strong></p>

  <p>This transition period can be utilized best of all by clarifying the position of the
  two class camps and vigorously defending the revolutionary gains. These U.S.
  <em>gauleiters</em> must not be allowed to dismantle or in any way change the status
  and critical autonomy of the armed forces or the complex of political and social
  institutions won by the revolution.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie says it will not carry out acts of war or sabotage in the country.
  The next important question is, if funds from U.S. imperialism come in as promised,
  they cannot be utilized by a Chamorro regime without the consent of the Sandinista
  leadership.</p>

  <p>Are there any bourgeois democracies where the party in office can accept funds from
  a foreign power without the approval of the opposition? Even if the revolutionary
  leadership assumes the role merely of an opposition party, it must participate in
  deciding how to spend the money and how this will affect the economy.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the revolutionary government bound itself to a mixed economy, which
  means capitalist commodity production as well as government-controlled and -owned
  institutions. The existence of many bourgeois economic and social institutions all
  along has been the basis for a variety of strikes and grievances of the workers and
  peasants. But the bourgeois aspects of the economy were tolerated by the government
  with the hope that its eventual triumph over the counterrevolution would enable it to
  begin the task of socialist construction in earnest. This was never spelled out, but
  was understood by the masses as well as the imperialist bourgeoisie. That's the basis
  for the bitter ten-year war. The war was not launched by the masses just for abstract
  bourgeois democracy, abstract independence.</p>

  <p>The issue now is whether the leaders will accommodate themselves to the new
  bourgeois imperialist puppets and hand over the power of the state or whether they will
  resist. The power is still in the hands of the revolutionary government. The Bush
  administration understands this. It has always acted on the premise that power comes
  out of the barrel of a gun, as Mao correctly formulated it.</p>

  <h4>Historic world context</h4>

  <p>We are only too keenly aware of the historic world context in which the Nicaraguan
  Revolution takes place. We have seen how the imperialist bourgeoisie becomes delirious
  with joy at the worldwide setbacks for socialism, and no doubt this has affected the
  thinking of others. But the Roman carnival that the bourgeoisie is having will be of a
  short-lived character. What lies on the horizon is the grim prospect of capitalist
  chaos, heightened by feverish competition for booty and profits. It can only lead to
  the inevitable collapse which has been such a familiar phenomenon during the entire
  tenure of capitalist development and from which no capitalist country can escape.</p>

  <p>When a boulder is unloosed from a faraway mountain top, an avalanche sometimes
  threatens the existence of everything in its path. But it will in no way help to use
  this as an excuse for capitulation and surrender.</p>

  <p>Whoever wills the objective, that is, the revolutionary victory of the popular
  masses, will also find the means to bring it about.</p>
