  <h1>A victory for People's China</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Jan. 25, 1990)</h5>

  <p>January 17 &mdash; We should not allow the very serious setbacks in Eastern Europe
  to obscure the real significance of the lifting of martial law in the People's Republic
  of China.</p>

  <p>It is from every point of view a historic victory of socialism over the forces of
  counterrevolution, supported and inspired by imperialism headed by the U.S.</p>

  <p>Of course, a formidable bourgeois reaction had been building up in China for some
  time. But notice this: During the entire month of June 1989, when martial law was
  instituted, the imperialist bourgeoisie pulled out all stops trying to mobilize world
  public opinion, imperiously demanding that martial law in China be lifted. Well, now it
  has been. And what is the attitude of the ruling class in the U.S.?</p>

  <h4>An anti-climax for the imperialists</h4>

  <p>The Bush administration, with tongue in cheek, claims it is a concession to the U.S.
  government.</p>

  <p>The bulk of the Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, and particularly the
  so-called liberals (Solarz, Dodd, Broomfield), have been loudest in their scorn for the
  lifting of martial law.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that martial law applied only in parts of Beijing. The great
  cities of Canton and Shanghai and the rest of the country were not affected by the
  martial law order (China Daily, Jan. 11).</p>

  <p>Earlier, the U.S. had expected that once martial law was lifted the
  counterrevolution would spring forward and, by virtue of its alleged wide support,
  would overwhelm the People's Republic. As it turned out, nothing of the sort has
  happened. This was one of the keenest disappointments for U.S. foreign policy in China.
  The lifting of martial law, for which they had been clamoring, was an anti-climactic
  event that exploded some of their most cherished hopes in respect to subversion of the
  People's Republic.</p>

  <p>What is martial law? Martial law means that the military forces of the state,
  whether it be a capitalist or a workers' state, have been called in either to supersede
  the civil authorities or to act with them in coordination to suppress social disorder
  or rebellion.</p>

  <h4>Crux of the problem</h4>

  <p>It is always a question, once the military has taken charge, whether it is acting
  autonomously or will obey the civil authorities and return to its normal military
  duties. Once such an extreme measure is taken, most particularly in time of social
  crisis, the real question is whether the military is acting as an agent, an auxiliary
  to support the civil government and the state, or is acting independently. The latter
  carries the threat, implied or expressed, of the military replacing the civil
  government. That's the crux of the problem.</p>

  <p>Instituting martial law is therefore an exceptional, extraordinary measure fraught
  with danger. Always to be borne in mind is that not merely the governing group but the
  class as a whole, its dictatorship, rests on the armed forces. In a workers' state,
  this should mean the armed popular forces of the workers and peasants. In a bourgeois
  state, it rests squarely on the military bureaucracy, the higher echelons &mdash; the
  general staff, the colonels, the lieutenant colonels &mdash; and also the lower
  echelons of the officer corps.</p>

  <p>Above everything else, the military reflects the class character of the state.</p>

  <p>What happened in China was that the military, after a confusing few days (made much
  worse as a result of imperialist lies and deceit disseminated by the bourgeois media),
  acted exclusively as an arm of the civilian government, of the workers' or socialist
  state, as it is popularly called.</p>

  <p>The talk about reverting to warlordism, about the development of antagonistic
  military cliques vying with each other while the civilian representatives of the
  workers' state were confused and divided, all this proved groundless.</p>

  <h4>Army acted as arm of government</h4>

  <p>As events have shown, the military acted as an arm of the People's Republic and
  carried out its mandate to end the counterrevolutionary disorders. That having been
  done, and civil life having returned to a sufficient degree of normalcy, the army
  followed instructions and retired to its normal functions. What does all this show?
  That the government, and in particular its leadership headed by the Communist Party, is
  in full command of the situation.</p>

  <p>It is truly a historic development and runs counter to all the calculations of the
  imperialist bourgeoisie. Prime Minister Li Peng, in his speech announcing the end of
  martial law, emphasized that "had the government not taken the resolute measure of
  imposing martial law ... , the fruits of revolution earned by several generations
  through protracted struggle, the achievements made in the four decades of socialist
  construction and in the decade-long reform and opening to the outside world would have
  been destroyed, our country would have been split up, and hundreds of millions of
  people would have again fallen into the abyss of misery." (China Daily, Jan. 11.)</p>

  <p>Li Peng twice mentioned the international situation, saying that "no matter what may
  happen in the world, we shall unswervingly follow the socialist road." (New York Times,
  Jan. 11.) He was addressing himself to Eastern Europe and the USSR as well as to the
  imperialist bourgeoisie.</p>

  <h4>Schlesinger's mission in 1976</h4>

  <p>The hope of the U.S. following the death of Mao Zedong was to reach out to the
  officer corps of the People's Liberation Army. It was with this in view that the U.S.
  government dispatched James R. Schlesinger, a former secretary of defense, to Mao's
  funeral in September 1976.</p>

  <p>Schlesinger was one of those who had vigorously pushed playing the so-called China
  card, that is, intervening to further envenom the relations between the USSR and China.
  Schlesinger went to China to offer U.S. military aid in the form of sophisticated
  technology. Indeed, he permitted himself to denigrate Soviet military equipment which
  he was shown in China and made a pitch for China to purchase sophisticated U.S.
  military equipment. The U.S. could not have picked a more suitable representative for
  such purposes.</p>

  <p>Schlesinger's counterpart in the Congress was the Senator from Washington, "Scoop"
  Jackson, who even earlier had been instrumental in putting through a cash sale of
  Boeing civil planes to China, which operated as the first opening of trade relations
  between China and the USSR.</p>

  <p>With Schlesinger's mission, it was not so much the sale of the technology which
  could prove decisive, not at a time when China had for many years been equipped with
  Soviet military technology. The main purpose was to make contact with China's officer
  corps. This has long been U.S. strategy in Third World countries, where it has had the
  most devastating effects, as in Chile and Indonesia.</p>

  <p>Since the victory of the Chinese Revolution in 1949, however, this has seemed a
  virtually impossible task, made doubly difficult by the fact that the ruling class
  refused for so many years to extend normal diplomatic relations to China. To suddenly
  make contact with the Chinese military was a far-fetched idea. If anything, it could
  only follow, not precede, full diplomatic recognition. But this had not yet been
  achieved, notwithstanding the opening of negotiations and the restoration of China's
  seat in the United Nations, which had been obstructed by the U.S.</p>

  <p>Both Schlesinger and Henry Kissinger had publicly announced in April of 1976 that
  the European allies were now free to exempt China from the ban imposed by COCOM (a
  committee of NATO) on the sale of military equipment to China. (New York Times, April
  25, 1976.) The European imperialist countries had recognized China many years
  earlier.</p>

  <h4>Why U.S. failed in China but won in Romania</h4>

  <p>The most significant development to emerge when the counterrevolution struck last
  June was that the U.S. had been unable to make a dent in the Chinese military, after
  all those years of attempting to cultivate relations. Why? Because it was a people's
  army, not a military camarilla set up before liberation when China was headed by
  military groupings and warlords.</p>

  <p>By contrast, the events in Romania especially have a certain relevance to the
  situation in China. In Romania, the military played the key role in the overthrow of
  the socialist government and prepared the way for the counterrevolution, which although
  still fragile has nevertheless constituted itself as the new government. The overthrow
  could not have taken place without the likes of General Nicolae Militaru and his
  colleagues in the disloyal military camarilla. The army was key to the coup d'etat.</p>

  <p>Sure, they surrounded themselves with a facade of civilians, some communist
  renegades, former officials, mostly those in the foreign affairs department, and have
  awakened a strata of the bourgeoisie which long had been thought dormant. Of course,
  the external forces of imperialism and bourgeois reformism, stimulated by events in the
  USSR, played key roles in the overturn in Romania. But the main difference between what
  happened in China and Romania is that the military in Romania acted in a disloyal
  manner, subverting the government in the interest of the bourgeois
  counterrevolution.</p>

  <p>The situation in Eastern Europe made Romania ripe for precisely such an attack. The
  civilian government became paralyzed due to the swiftness of the coup d'etat, which it
  has been admitted was planned long in advance. As can be clearly inferred from an Op-ed
  piece (New York Times, Dec. 28) by Mary Ellen Fischer, author of the book <em>Nicolae
  Ceausescu,</em> the U.S. was well advised and had its hand in it from the beginning, as
  did the French and probably the German imperialists as well.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev administration, which encouraged the overthrow of the Ceausescu
  government, got far more than it could ever have desired in terms of creating a danger
  for itself.</p>

  <h4>Instability in Romania</h4>

  <p>Now the military has shown that it is impatient with civilian bourgeois rule, and is
  taking over even local governments in the towns of Timisoara and Iasi (New York TImes,
  Jan. 13 and 15). Throughout Romania, the new rulers are an unstable coalition of
  warring bourgeois cliques, where the most rabid anti-communist and fascist elements
  come to the fore.</p>

  <p>The banning of the Communist Party, its revocation the next day, a demand for the
  death penalty (to execute communists, of course), all this shows the utterly unstable
  character of the grouping of renegades and counterrevolutionaries that the military was
  able to assemble to act as a facade.</p>

  <p>No wonder, then, that Silviu Brucan, one of the principal leaders in the so-called
  Council of National Salvation, complains that while France, the USSR, Britain and the
  Federal Republic of Germany are all sending top Cabinet officials to visit Romania,
  "Many in Bucharest are disappointed with the slow, modest, cautious reaction of
  Washington to the Romanian events. They ask themselves, `Why?' " (New York Times, Jan.
  14.)</p>

  <p>The answer should be very clear. The U.S. is not going to commit itself to this
  motley group and is banking on the military. Again, as Fischer hinted, they already
  have their candidate picked &mdash; General Militaru.</p>

  <p>Yet the situation is fluid. While hundreds if not thousands of communists have been
  executed or are in jail, including the whole Politburo, the mass of the working class
  as such has not been an active factor one way or the other in the situation. The regime
  has been unable to produce any large demonstration of workers, or even the mention of
  trade unions as participants in the counterrevolution.</p>

  <p>The economic situation can't be solved in Romania on a capitalist basis any more
  than it is being solved in Hungary and Poland, where the counterrevolution has taken
  over. It is only accelerating the misery with unemployment, inflation, and other
  symptoms of a bourgeois economy, which has been foisted upon the socialized economic
  sectors.</p>

  <p>The problems in Hungary and Poland are the accumulated results of bourgeois,
  anti-socialist reforms which began to be seen as early as 1956 and which have sabotaged
  the socialist planning ever since, bringing about these very symptoms of capitalist
  decay.</p>

  <p>While the counterrevolution has triumphed on top, the issue still is whether the
  working class can effectively mount a revolutionary counteroffensive, and whether its
  working class allies in Eastern Europe can support it. This is of course the most
  urgent task of international solidarity.</p>

  <p>Will the forces of proletarian internationalism, of working class solidarity, break
  through in the USSR? Will new independent forces stretch their hands to the victims of
  the counterrevolution, rather than conciliate with the reactionaries as Gorbachev and
  his grouping of bourgeois reformers are doing?</p>
