  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Hoax at the UN (Dec. 6, 1990)</title>

  <h1>Hoax at the UN</h1>

  <h2>Imperialist powers manipulate Security Council</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Dec. 6, 1990)</h5>

  <p>November 27 &mdash; This is being written two days before action is to be taken on
  what is supposed to be the crucial UN resolution that will empower the U.S. to do
  "whatever is deemed necessary" in the Middle East. The Pentagon is poised to hurl an
  assault at Saddam Hussein's military in Kuwait, and, if "necessary," to directly attack
  Iraq.</p>

  <p>Enormous momentum has been built up by the U.S. to get thinly veiled approval from
  the Security Council for its imperialist military adventure in the Middle East.
  Secretary of State Baker and President Bush have been hurrying and scurrying, virtually
  girdling the globe to make sure the necessary resolution is passed with wording that
  gives the U.S. military the green light.</p>

  <p>All of the maneuvering, negotiations and diplomacy are supposedly centered on the UN
  as the legitimate world body empowered to decide whether there will be war or peace. It
  is made to appear that the UN is the indisputable world leader and the Security Council
  its preeminent executive body.</p>

  <p>But it is all a colossal hoax, a cynical charade. The UN is being used as nothing
  but an imperialist tool, a screen behind which the U.S. can hide, a cover so the
  Pentagon can claim international approval for its war plans.</p>

  <p>The U.S. has held seemingly endless discussions with the USSR, as well as with China
  and other members of the Security Council from the Third World. It seems as though the
  Bush-Baker team is turning heaven and earth to make sure the resolution gives a
  protective coloring to each and every member of the Security Council. They'll be on
  record saying a peaceful resolution is preferable &mdash; but the U.S. can decide that
  "all measures deemed necessary" means it has the right to open its military
  offensive.</p>

  <p>It is now rumored that China may abstain or not vote for the U.S.-sponsored war
  resolution. That's not the same as a veto, which would be a real contribution to the
  anti-imperialist struggle. However, by voting for the 10 previous resolutions sponsored
  by the U.S., China has contributed heavily to giving the imperialist alliance
  credibility. In earlier years, China would have denounced the U.S. military deployment
  as an imperialist attempt to rob the oppressed peoples of their wealth and natural
  resources.</p>

  <p>Is the UN really an independent body making the vital decisions on the serious,
  critical issues of war and peace? Nothing could be further from the truth. These
  decisions are being made by a small clique of imperialists, organized by the U.S.,
  which has corralled the rest of the world.</p>

  <h4>How UN got started</h4>

  <p>It is only necessary to take the briefest possible historical look at the genesis of
  the UN, and at the real attitude of the U.S. government toward the other nations of the
  world, to see what is at the bottom of the issue.</p>

  <p>The UN came into being as a result of the Second World War, a war in which the USSR,
  to the surprise of the whole world, defeated the Nazis in most of Europe. At the end of
  the war, the Soviet Union was on the verge of moving troops not only as far as Korea
  but possibly even to Tokyo. U.S. historians admit that one of Truman's considerations
  in dropping the atomic bomb on Japan was to prevent Japan from surrendering to the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>This great momentum of the Soviet military was based upon the achievements of
  socialist construction despite years of hardship and deprivation.</p>

  <p>So the victorious Allied imperialists set up the UN as a barrier against the USSR
  and also as an instrument to hold in check the rising revolutions against the old
  colonial regimes in all parts of the world. The imperialists also deemed that a world
  organization was necessary to ward off the impending victories of the Western
  proletariat against the capitalist governments, as in France and Italy, and the labor
  insurgency that turned over conservative bourgeois regimes in favor of labor
  governments, most notably in Britain.</p>

  <p>More than anything, they needed some legal stratagem whereby they could continue on
  the road of imperialist oppression while appearing to unite all nations in a democratic
  new world order.</p>

  <p>But in order to control such an international forum, the victorious imperialists
  needed a veto power over any and all resolutions this body might pass. To make it
  somewhat more effective, it was necessary to draw the USSR into it, and also give it
  veto power. This would lend legitimacy to the concept of a world organization being led
  by the so-called great powers.</p>

  <p>In reality, however, this arrangement gave what amounted to a hereditary veto power
  to the imperialist countries, which could not forever count on achieving their
  objectives by utilizing colonial and neocolonial clients.</p>

  <h4>What has UN accomplished?</h4>

  <p>After 45 years as a world organization, the UN cannot point to one significant world
  issue where it made an independent decision or to one imperialist intervention that it
  stopped.</p>

  <p>The UN did nothing about the brutal U.S. imperialist interventions in Vietnam, Laos,
  Cambodia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Grenada, Panama or the Dominican Republic. It actually
  assisted in the U.S. war against Korea and the destruction of the Lumumba government in
  the Congo.</p>

  <p>While the U.S. has engineered countless imperialist interventions in the Third World
  directed against the oppressed peoples, the UN has never helped and doesn't now help
  any national liberation movement. The sanctions it imposed on South Africa, a state
  built upon open racism, were of little more than symbolic value. At the very most it
  has been able to send in a so-called neutral force, usually from Sweden or India, to
  validate the accomplishments and the victories of revolutionary national liberation
  movements.</p>

  <p>The UN has permitted the Israeli government, a puppet of U.S. imperialism, to carry
  out endless interventions &mdash; amounting to a merciless war &mdash; against Lebanon.
  Israel has continued its genocidal policy against the Palestinians, and all the UN has
  ever been able to do is pass toothless, sanctimonious resolutions. It has never been
  able to take any concrete measure against Israel, even when Israel bombed Iraq's
  nuclear facilities without any provocation or excuse.</p>

  <h4>U.S. treatment of UN</h4>

  <p>What has been the attitude of the U.S. to the UN throughout all these many years? It
  has been scorn and contempt. Whenever it can't get its way fully in the UN, it
  withholds its dues and assessments as a form of sabotage.</p>

  <p>Nothing so much showed U.S. imperialism's contempt for the UN as when one of
  Reagan's UN representatives openly said at a Security Council meeting that if the UN
  didn't like it here, they could move.</p>

  <p>But now, all of a sudden, the UN has become a heralded world organization! It is now
  the repository for the settlement of all disputes &mdash; most particularly, to
  sanction the U.S. intervention in the Middle East.</p>

  <p>Ever since Aug. 2, the day of the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait, the UN has become once
  again that great deliberative world organization whose executive organ, the Security
  Council, will decide when or if the U.S. can militarily open its long-prepared attack
  on Iraq.</p>

  <p>Why has the U.S. suddenly turned away from its position of constantly denigrating
  and sabotaging the UN and become its champion? Why isn't it acting unilaterally, as it
  has in other counterrevolutionary interventions and wars? Why does it suddenly make it
  seem that U.S. military strategy is dependent upon UN diplomacy?</p>

  <p>The answers to these questions are not only pertinent. They are absolutely
  indispensable for an understanding of the real driving forces behind the intervention
  and deployment of U.S. forces in the Middle East.</p>

  <p>The basis for the intervention has nothing whatever to do with saving Kuwait from
  the "aggression" of Iraq. In fact, there is plenty of evidence to show that the U.S.
  was in the midst of negotiations with Iraq and up to a point was willing to go along
  with an Iraqi move in Kuwait. But that in itself is not the basic answer.</p>

  <p>The U.S. deployment of such a huge military and naval force is the result of a
  secret agreement among the leading imperialist powers. From Denmark to Tokyo, and
  including France, Britain and Germany, they want to divide up the world's resources,
  break the back of OPEC, and reduce the Middle Eastern states to the role of vassals,
  crushing those that try to exercise their sovereignty. These secret agreements are
  modeled on the notorious Sykes-Picot pact of 1916 between Britain, France and Czarist
  Russia to divide up the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

  <h4>Struggle to redivide the world</h4>

  <p>It's an attempt to overhaul the world balance of power in such a way that the
  leading imperialist powers will be able to redivide the sources of raw materials, of
  oil, of gas, as well as world markets and technology. That would be completely to the
  detriment not only of the Arabian Peninsula but of the oppressed peoples of the world
  in general.</p>

  <p>That's how the united front of the imperialists was formed: on the basis of a
  predatory onslaught against the oppressed peoples.</p>

  <p>The imperialists, who have been at loggerheads for so much of this century, whose
  rivalries have even spawned two horrendous world wars, are now in an alliance, but this
  unity is a rare phenomenon.</p>

  <p>What objective conditions convinced them that the time was ripe for such an
  adventure? The key lies in the collapse of the regimes in Eastern Europe and the
  destabilization and vandalizing of socialist construction in the USSR, a process which
  has taken on breakneck speed in recent years with the Gorbachev regime's
  accommodationist attitude toward the U.S.</p>

  <p>The defection of the USSR, as well as China, from the anti-imperialist struggle is
  the key factor enabling imperialism to mobilize for this murderous onslaught.</p>

  <p>By no stretch of the imagination could the imperialists have gotten together if both
  those countries had stood firmly together, as they did in the 1950s, and taken a
  straightforward anti-imperialist position against the U.S. military deployment.</p>

  <p>Had they roundly denounced it as naked aggression, it is doubtful that even the
  imperialist powers themselves would have permitted the U.S. deployment of such a
  gigantic military and naval armada. Certainly France and Germany would not have easily
  come along, notwithstanding prior secret agreements. And Japan too would have
  hesitated, despite its own secret understandings with the U.S.</p>

  <p>All the imperialist powers have their own bilateral secret agreements on how the
  spoils from a victory over Iraq would be divided. But all are fearful of a
  revolutionary conflagration that could follow the commencement of military hostilities
  by the U.S.</p>

  <p>The virtual renunciation of the anti-imperialist struggle has been repeated over and
  over again in the many meetings between Shevardnadze and Baker and Bush and Gorbachev.
  So it has become almost a commonplace to speak of the collaboration between the Soviet
  Union and the U.S. as collaboration between two super-powers in alliance against the
  oppressed.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the prospect of massive insurrections and the overthrow of the
  puppet client regimes in the Middle East frightens them all. It is reported in the New
  York Times on Nov. 26 that the frantic pace of U.S. diplomacy is calculated to cut down
  the time element during which the anti-war movement can organize itself.</p>

  <h4>USSR and China</h4>

  <p>Hence the importance of the meeting this last weekend between China and the USSR
  &mdash; a meeting that at another time might have been construed as an attempt to
  broaden and consolidate socialist relationships. Of course, commerce and trade between
  the two have increased dramatically over the last few years. But their relations today
  are not based on a revival of mutual aid in the construction of socialism. Both
  countries have moved away from that kind of cooperation.</p>

  <p>The meeting between Moscow and Beijing might have held out some hope that China and
  the USSR would restrain the Pentagon from its adventure in the Gulf. But this is a very
  thin reed to rely on.</p>

  <p>If the U.S. rounds up the majority of the UN Security Council behind its resolution,
  and claims the political and diplomatic support of the USSR and China, then these two
  formerly firm pillars of the socialist camp will have caved in to U.S. imperialism,
  will have aided and abetted this conspiracy to divide the world markets, sources of raw
  materials, etc., in exchange for some kind of quid pro quo for themselves.</p>

  <p>China already has obtained promises that Washington will lift the sanctions imposed
  as a result of the suppression of the Tiananmen Square counterrevolution. But the USSR,
  which has been in the forefront of condemning Iraq, thus far has not been able to get
  material concessions that are in any way commensurate with the enormous crime it is
  committing by supporting U.S. imperialism politically and diplomatically. Nevertheless,
  Gorbachev continues to be most vociferous in his political support for U.S. goals.</p>

  <p>The UN is nothing but a screen behind which the imperialists are carrying out their
  predatory schemes.</p>

  <p>But there is also fear among the imperialists of rising revolutionary resistance
  which can lead to successful insurrections against the pro-imperialist regimes in the
  Middle East. This new round of worldwide anti-imperialist struggles, along with a
  rising anti-war movement in the United States and a simultaneous working class upsurge,
  doesn't augur well for imperialist intervention.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, growing resistance to national and racist oppression along with the
  resurgence in the labor movement opens up the widest possible area for an all-around
  struggle against capitalist exploitation and imperialist oppression. Such a development
  can have only the greatest historic significance for the destiny of the international
  working class and socialism.</p>
