  <h1>Self-determination, imperialism and Lithuania</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 5, 1990)</h5>

  <p>Ever since the Lithuanian crisis began, an unending stream of official
  pronouncements from Washington has expressed "deep" and "profound" concern over the
  wellbeing and future of the Baltic republics.</p>

  <p>If it isn't the White House, it's the State Department and even Secretary of Defense
  Richard Cheney expressing concern for the independence of Lithuania and warning the
  Soviet Union.</p>

  <h4>Self-determination? Not here!</h4>

  <p>Of course, this deep, profound concern for the independence of small nations does
  not include Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa, the Virgin Islands, or above all the small
  nations of the Pacific held hostage to atomic experiments and now to radioactive waste,
  for which they have suffered long and never been fully compensated. This concern about
  regions being incorporated into a larger power has nothing to do with the annexation of
  Alaska and Hawaii.</p>

  <p>Only a government that is thoroughly hypocritical and corrupt can talk about the
  wellbeing and independence of the far-away Baltic republics after having invaded
  Grenada, caused devastation and havoc in Panama, carried out a ten-year aggression
  against Nicaragua, and escalated military and political maneuvers against Cuba. The
  media news is filled with Lithuania and is completely silent on Panama, as though
  freedom and peace reigned supreme there instead of daily arrests of the opponents of
  U.S. occupation.</p>

  <p>For the two centuries that the Baltic peoples (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) were
  oppressed by the czarist autocracy, Washington never noticed. But suddenly, in the
  midst of the coldest days of the Cold War, the U.S. discovered that it had not really
  recognized their incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940. It immediately began to
  finance and politically support the bogus Baltic governments in exile &mdash; stationed
  in the U.S., of course.</p>

  <h4>`Window of opportunity'</h4>

  <p>It is impossible to consider the situation of Lithuania and the Baltic republics
  separate and apart from the series of reactionary developments that have taken place in
  the USSR and Eastern Europe. And it would be disregarding the historical record to
  believe that the capitalist countries, in particular the U.S., do not see them as an
  attractive "window of opportunity" and are not scheming to bring the republics within
  the fold of imperialist expansion and capitalist exploitation.</p>

  <p>The incorporation of the Baltic republics into the USSR in 1940 (by a valid
  referendum) was not the result of some whim of the Soviet Union. Indeed, it can only be
  understood in light of the historical evolution of the 1930s and '40s. Detaching them
  from their historical context and isolating the events to suit the purposes of
  imperialist interests is the worst of all blunders.</p>

  <p>Soviet diplomacy in the period of the '30s was wholly oriented toward maintaining
  peaceful coexistence and the European status quo. Stalin himself, in a well-known
  interview in 1936 with Roy Howard of the Scripps-Howard newspapers, said of Soviet
  foreign policy: "We don't want a foot of foreign territory, nor will we give up an inch
  of our own."</p>

  <h4>Soviet policy in the 1930s</h4>

  <p>Indeed, the Soviet leaders pursued a peaceful and, from a revolutionary
  internationalist point of view, even a pacifist posture. The USSR wanted nothing more
  than to be left alone to unfold its domestic economic planning, which was bringing
  stupendous industrial progress at a time when the capitalist world was undergoing the
  deepest depression.</p>

  <p>But what happened? The victory of the Nazi Party, the destruction of the working
  class organizations in Germany, and the menacing, militaristic rise of Hitlerism
  changed the entire character of the international situation. However, that by no means
  signaled an adventurous, expansionist military policy by the USSR. On the contrary,
  USSR diplomacy was characterized by a continuing diplomatic approach to the imperialist
  democracies &mdash; the U.S., Britain, France and the others &mdash; to form a bloc to
  defeat the war plans of the Nazi regime. These countries, however, turned a deaf ear to
  the Soviet Union's plea for a serious alliance against the Hitlerite menace.</p>

  <p>Putting aside the question of proletarian internationalism and how it was affected
  by a policy of relying so much on the imperialist democracies to fight another
  imperialist (fascist) power, it has to be noted in the current context that the USSR
  was making an effort to at least retain the status quo against the menace of Hitler,
  Mussolini and the rising tide of Japanese militarism &mdash; which was inflicting a
  cruel, merciless war on China, Korea and throughout Asia.</p>

  <p>During this period, the USSR paid scant attention to the Baltic states. Their status
  was the same as it had been after the Bolshevik Revolution, when proletarian
  insurrections in these states failed, mainly because the Baltic bourgeoisie got
  "bipartisan" support from both the Entente governments and the Allies against working
  class insurrection.</p>

  <h4>Fruits of the Munich Pact</h4>

  <p>What changed all this? It was the conspiracy of the Western "democratic"
  imperialists with Hitler, resulting in the 1938 Munich Pact. The pact, signed by
  Chamberlain (Britain), Daladier (France), Mussolini (Italy) and Hitler (Germany) gave
  Nazi imperialism the green light to move into Czechoslovakia, clearly opening the road
  for aggression against the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>No amount of diplomatic protests by the USSR were of any avail. They were all
  brushed aside. As the cynical imperialist democrats put it, peace was bought with
  Hitler for a small price.</p>

  <p>The more brutally frank elements in the ruling class were openly elated. The
  prospect of the Nazis fighting the Communists in a life-and-death struggle seemed a
  happy occasion to the Patterson-McCormick chain of newspapers, the ultra-isolationists
  who controlled the Chicago Tribune. They were delighted by the prospect of a war in
  which the U.S. supplied both camps with economic and military means in exchange for
  cash. They assumed that the USSR would merely sit by with folded arms and watch Hitler
  strengthen his hold in the East while the Allied imperialists were beginning to prepare
  militarily in the West.</p>

  <p>The USSR had to decide what to do to obtain a breathing spell and turn the
  diplomatic situation around vis-a-vis Nazi Germany and the imperialist Allies.</p>

  <p>This is how the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact of 1939, also known as the
  Stalin-Hitler Pact, was born. In principle, there was nothing wrong with playing one
  group of imperialists against another in the interests of defending the workers' state.
  It was wholly proper in the self-interest of the working class and consistent with
  proletarian internationalism.</p>

  <p>However, what blunted this important diplomatic maneuver was that the Soviet
  leadership had so oriented the working class and progressive, anti-war movement to
  idealize the bourgeoisie's attachment to democracy that it identified the imperialist
  democracies with the struggle against Hitlerism. That the USSR would resort to a
  maneuver to safeguard itself, particularly its western borders, disoriented a great
  many in the movement.</p>

  <h4>USSR takes a defensive move</h4>

  <p>What was the objective of the pact with Germany? To fortify the USSR against Nazi
  Germany and also against any combined attack of the Allies along with Germany.
  Considering that the West had given Hitler the green light in Czechoslovakia, in clear
  violation of the Soviet-French agreement of 1934 (the so-called Stalin-Lavalle Pact),
  the USSR saw the need to secure its western borders. It was in effect a defensive
  measure, when one considers the threat it faced from Hitler's takeover of Central
  Europe.</p>

  <p>Seen from the point of view of military necessity and diplomatic expediency, there
  was nothing unusual in such an arrangement once the Allied imperialists had signed the
  Munich Pact with Hitler.</p>

  <p>Thus, the move into the Baltics arose out of military necessity in the face of a
  truly terrible threat of imperialist attack. Viewed in the light of the global struggle
  that was developing, it was a minor incident.</p>

  <p>The outcry in the West against the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact was not based
  on what was happening in the Baltics. When the imperialist war against the USSR broke
  out in full fury, and the Nazis occupied the Baltics, that was only discussed in the
  press from the viewpoint of how it affected the military situation as a whole. None of
  the imperialists were worried about the independence of the Baltics. Their concern as
  always was whether the USSR would emerge victorious over the Nazis and become a
  "superpower."</p>

  <p>One would have to look high and low throughout the capitalist press of the period to
  find any concern about the independence of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Not even
  after the Cold War started did this become a public issue in the U.S. It was only after
  the USSR demonstrated that it also had a nuclear capability, and was building a navy
  and a submarine force, that the U.S. began to look around for areas which would become
  of military significance to them at a later date.</p>

  <h4>No similarity to liberation movements</h4>

  <p>One of the first things to note about Lithuania's so-called independence movement is
  that it is utterly unlike any national liberation movement of modern times. The
  movement, and particularly its leadership, is so notoriously oriented to imperialism
  that it has been unable to acquire even a modicum of international supporters.</p>

  <p>Take, for instance, its so-called declaration of independence. It is not addressed
  to the world community, the United Nations, or the Non-Aligned Movement. A carefully
  worded telex communication from the leadership calls only upon the governments (not the
  nations) of the "world family of democratic nations," asking for "kind assistance,"
  political and moral support. The only acknowledgment it has received thus far, judging
  by press reports, came from Washington, where this "independence movement" has been
  lodged and financed since the 1940s.</p>

  <p>This movement has no affinity to the guerrilla struggles in the Philippines or Peru,
  the masses in Southern Africa, or even the Quebecois or the IRA. It may be called an
  aristocratic group of bourgeois dissidents, who are depending on the largess of their
  paymaster.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Baltic bourgeoisie have displayed an openly chauvinist attitude toward
  the Russian and Polish workers in the republics, who officially make up 15% of the
  population.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie from the several Baltic republics believe they can play an
  independent role in contemporary global politics &mdash; an illusion, especially at
  this time when the large imperialists in Europe are uniting against competition. These
  states can only become a source of capital accumulation, based on an intensification of
  the exploitation of Baltic workers. They can only be swallowed up with the conversion
  of social property into private property.</p>

  <p>Such a development has significance for the Third World. Capital accumulation will
  become a source for further expansion and greater exploitation, strengthening the hand
  of the bourgeoisie over the workers and intensifying the exploitation of the oppressed
  countries.</p>

  <p>What progressive interest do the workers and oppressed people have in this kind of
  self-determination? Self-determination of nations has to be consistent with the
  worldwide interests of other oppressed nations and of the working class. Here it is not
  so at all.</p>

  <p>The leaders of this movement thought they would catapult into power with the support
  of imperialism. But it hasn't turned out to be so easy.</p>

  <p>Vytautas Landsbergis, the so-called president of Lithuania, is reported by the New
  York Times (March 28) to have said, "The U.S. sold us out." But Landsbergis's mouth
  usually runs ahead of Washington's plans.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be totally unaware that a week ago the Senate passed a unanimous
  resolution on Lithuania which deliberately failed to recommend that the White House
  officially recognize the independence of Lithuania. That's because of the intense
  maneuvers between Washington and Moscow. Notwithstanding all the talk about the end of
  the Cold War, an irreconcilable struggle between the two antagonistic social systems
  continues.</p>

  <p>The privileged status of the Baltic bourgeoisie did not begin with the Gorbachev
  administration. It is a product of the struggle between imperialism and the USSR and
  flows from the geographical position of the Baltics. Unlike the underdeveloped southern
  republics of the USSR, the Baltics have had privileges showered on them for years
  merely to prevent their defection to the imperialist camp at a time when the war danger
  has been a principal factor motivating Soviet policy toward this part of the USSR.</p>

  <h4>Lithuania subject of U.S.-USSR discussion</h4>

  <p>It is not to be wondered at that when the Soviet Deputy Ambassador to the U.S. was
  asked on CNN on March 27 if the situation in Lithuania and Soviet troop movements are a
  matter of negotiation between the U.S. and the USSR, he cautiously replied that Foreign
  Minister Shevardnadze would soon be visiting the U.S. and that might be a topic of
  discussion.</p>

  <p>This then is the essence of the matter. The Lithuanian crisis has to be seen in the
  context of the world struggle. To separate it out and move the topic to somewhere in
  the stratosphere to an abstract discussion of the self-determination of nations would
  do violence to reality.</p>

  <p>Were the issue of self-determination really what was involved, the working class of
  the world and all the oppressed people should support it. It's a Leninist principle.
  The right of secession was championed during the Leninist period and is stated in the
  Soviet constitution to this very day (although at present it is under modification by
  the Congress of Soviet Deputies, a matter we defer for later discussion).</p>

  <p>A struggle for self-determination led to Norway's separation from Sweden in 1905
  after a referendum. Lenin remarked that although historically Marxists favored the
  amalgamation of all countries into a world federation of nations, separation was
  important in order to improve the relations between the Norwegian and Swedish
  workers.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding possible changes in the constitution of the USSR, the right of
  nations to self-determination is an extension of the principle of making socialism
  fully consistent with democratic procedures and relations between nations.</p>

  <p>But here again, it is important not to lose sight of the reality of the contemporary
  period we are living in &mdash; a period when bourgeois reaction has gone so far in the
  USSR as a result of the Gorbachev reforms that it threatens the very existence of the
  Soviet Union as a multinational state. The disintegration of the USSR has become a
  topic of discussion. Violence and disruption in a number of the republics is
  splintering the USSR and opening it up to dismemberment. Even in the Ukraine, which has
  had the most solid relationship with the center, there are alarming signs of
  centrifugal forces at work, bringing to the fore a recrudescence of bourgeois
  nationalism.</p>

  <h4>Reforms began in Baltics</h4>

  <p>Gorbachev first experimented with his reforms in the Baltic areas. He followed his
  predecessors' tack of making concessions to the bourgeois elements, expecting this to
  strengthen the ties of the Baltics to the USSR. It boomeranged; the bourgeois elements,
  after being fattened by concessions over the years, had become arrogant and
  impatient.</p>

  <p>Another factor is that the Soviet leadership at varying times since the Second World
  War has regarded the Baltics as their window to the West. But this also worked in
  reverse.</p>

  <p>Lenin himself at one time signed a decree on the independence of Finland, during a
  short-lived period when imperialist aggression seemed to have waned. And after World
  War II, the USSR under Khrushchev agreed to end the occupation of Austria. While
  bourgeois, and dominated to a large extent by German and U.S. interests, its neutral
  status nevertheless posed no threat once Soviet troops vacated the area.</p>

  <p>Were this a possibility for the Baltics under the present circumstances, similar
  considerations might be entertained. But today the centrifugal forces unloosed by the
  Gorbachev administration pose the question of the dismemberment of the USSR. The very
  fact that it is a negotiating element in U.S.-USSR relations indicates that what's
  involved is not any abstract principle of self-determination but the reciprocal
  relations of imperialism to an ever-more besieged Soviet Union.</p>

  <h4>Struggle for survival of USSR</h4>

  <p>We are now facing a struggle for the survival of the Soviet Union as a workers'
  state, notwithstanding all its deformations and notwithstanding the serious
  contributions that the Gorbachev regime has made in the direction of bourgeois
  restoration. What then are the progressive, working class and anti-imperialist elements
  to do under these circumstances?</p>

  <p>Clearly, the developments in what we used to call the socialist camp are such as to
  embolden imperialism and make it more aggressive than ever. Were we to side with the
  Lithuanians in this matter, it would be giving objective support to the trend against
  socialism in the USSR and for the aims of imperialism.</p>

  <p>Our tactics and strategy have to be based on the recognition that whatever the
  bourgeois deformations in the USSR, and regardless of the current policy of the
  leadership, the axis of the world struggle is still between the two social systems.
  Notwithstanding all the efforts of both Washington and Moscow to propagate the illusion
  of amiability and good neighborly relations, holding out an end not merely to military
  warfare but to class warfare as well, the fact that Washington is pushing to the limit
  its advantages in the Baltics shows up the grim reality of the contemporary world
  struggle.</p>

  <p>Our position should be based on the defense of the integrity of the USSR as a
  multinational socialist state against imperialist incursions, interventions and the
  like. But our support has to be of a critical type, in the sense that we are
  unreservedly opposed to the bourgeois orientation of the Gorbachev leadership, which
  has led the Soviet camp from one disaster to another, from the Baltics to the borders
  of Mongolia.</p>
