  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: How to combat capitalist disinformation (Aug. 9,

  <h1>How to combat capitalist disinformation</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Aug. 9, 1990)</h5>

  <p>Two reports have appeared in the New York Times that allege racism on the part of
  the USSR. One article on July 26 announces that the Soviet Union will sell uncut
  diamonds mined in the USSR through the international diamond cartel of De Beers, which
  is a South African-controlled company. There is, of course, a worldwide anti-apartheid
  boycott of all South African companies in solidarity with the struggle in that
  country.</p>

  <p>The other New York Times article on July 30, datelined Johannesburg, reports "an
  announcement that the Moscow Circus plans to tour here next year has dramatized the new
  relationship that South Africa is cultivating with the Soviet Union and some of its
  Warsaw Pact neighbors as a consequence of political changes in southern Africa and
  Eastern Europe."</p>

  <p>Progressives, and communists in particular, have learned over the years to discount
  racist and anti-Soviet propaganda emanating from the South African regime and dismiss
  it out-of-hand. It is important to remember that a significant aspect of the South
  African propaganda machine is to disseminate disinformation which the imperialist press
  worldwide graciously carries, especially if it has an anti-Soviet angle.</p>

  <p>The suspicion that these reports are deliberately concocted by the South African
  government looms large since the reports have been timed to coincide with a very
  splendid and large demonstration by the South African Communist Party, which was
  attended by many prominent officials of the African National Congress, including its
  leader Nelson Mandela.</p>

  <p>This rally was a high water mark in showing the solidarity between the South African
  Communist Party and the ANC. Nothing can serve the South African regime better than to
  disrupt the solidarity and sow confusion and demoralization with those reports.</p>

  <p>It was impossible in the early period of the USSR for the Soviet Union to answer
  each and every slander that appeared in the capitalist press. Today, it is still
  difficult to do so. Communists throughout the world have had to learn to separate fact
  from fiction in the capitalist press.</p>

  <p>But there are some allegations that have to be answered promptly and expeditiously
  by the USSR not only to counter the anti-Sovietism, but as in this case, to answer the
  charges of poisonous racism as well.</p>

  <p>As of now, however, the USSR has not issued a statement on these reports. Inquiries
  made to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., and to the Soviet news agency Tass in
  New York City have shed no light on whether the USSR has denied the reports or
  confirmed them. This is unfortunate.</p>

  <p>These reports occur at a time when there is uneasiness throughout the progressive
  and revolutionary movements worldwide concerning the scaling down of Soviet aid to the
  national liberation movements. It therefore makes it imperative for the Soviet Union to
  respond not only in its own interest, but in the interest of the worldwide
  anti-imperialist and working class struggle.</p>

  <p>Unless there is some explanation from the USSR, the likelihood is that these
  allegations will be seen in the light of the domestic situation in the USSR.</p>

  <h4>Foreign policy an extension of domestic policy</h4>

  <p>Economics determines politics in the long run. The economic reforms initiated by the
  Gorbachev administration in the USSR are what determine its political course at home.
  Whatever the domestic policy may be, the foreign policy will surely become an extension
  of it and reflect the internal course of the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>In December 1986, when the Gorbachev administration ousted the Kazakh party leader
  Dinmukhamed A. Kunayev and replaced him with Gennadi V. Kolbin, a Russian, it was an
  unmitigated act of chauvinism. It was subsequently revealed that it was a case of a
  conservative, or so-called hard liner on the reforms, being replaced by someone more
  amenable to Gorbachev's anti-socialist bourgeois program.</p>

  <p>This act of removing Kunayev was followed with a rebellion in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan.
  In that early period of the reforms, scant attention was paid to the rebellion. It was
  mostly regarded as an isolated event concerning one nationality in one republic in the
  USSR. But, as we pointed out at the time, it was not. Rebellions in Azerbaijan,
  Armenia, Georgia and other areas followed.</p>

  <p>Now we learn from the recently concluded 28th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party
  that Kolbin is out, and that the new Kazakh Communist Party leader and president is
  Nursultan A. Nazarbaev who is Kazakh and not Russian.</p>

  <p>This move seems to have corrected the earlier gross error and high-handedness shown
  in the removal of the former leader of the Kazakh Communist Party, Kunayev. But this
  change is more form than essence. Nazarbaev not only promotes the Gorbachev bourgeois
  reforms, but he goes considerably further and is not fearful of making his position
  clear while in the U.S.</p>

  <p>Nazarbaev is currently in the U.S. attempting to make a deal with Chevron Oil
  Company, among others, for joint ventures. His visit to the U.S. comes on the heels of
  the 28th Soviet Party Congress where Gorbachev appears to have consolidated his
  grouping against the conservatives and has given the green light to implement the
  anti-socialist reforms.</p>

  <p>According to the July 30 New York Times, Nazarbaev has "prepared his own economic
  development plan that he says stresses the privatization of property, dissolution of
  monopolies, expansion of entrepreneurship, and the independence of enterprises."</p>

  <p>In this same article, Nazarbaev reassures potential investors and shows he is
  willing to go beyond Gorbachev's program to obtain "economic sovereignty." He states:
  "We want a large number of American companies to work with us and we understand it has
  to be profitable to U.S. businesses. ... I think the Soviet government has been going
  about this all wrong and should not now be frightening off the foreign businessmen with
  whom they should be dealing."</p>

  <h4>Natural resources now property of republics</h4>

  <p>Nazarbaev can make such offers while in the U.S. because the Soviet Congress of
  Deputies passed a law which states that the natural resources are the property of the
  individual republics of the USSR. Kazakhstan has an immense oil reserve in the Tengiz
  field. The interest of the transnational oil companies in Kazakhstan is enormous and
  their appetite for profits is insatiable.</p>

  <p>In the early 1970s and before, the USSR offered Japanese as well as U.S.
  transnational corporations the possibility of exploring the southern part of the USSR
  for oil and other natural resources for development purposes. The oil companies were to
  be compensated for the exploration; it was not a proposal for joint ventures. The aim
  at that time was to enable the USSR to develop those areas in the interest of socialist
  construction.</p>

  <p>Those Soviet offers to Japan and the U.S. went little beyond what Lenin had offered
  to foreign imperialist monopolies for development purposes during the New Economic
  Policy (NEP) period. But the U.S. and Japanese corporations, just as in Lenin's time,
  turned the Soviet Union down.</p>

  <p>The difference now lies in the new property law in the USSR that makes Soviet
  natural resources the property of the individual republics. In and of itself, this
  particular section of the law could be progressive. It could serve the interest not
  only of the individual republics, but could also weld them together in socialist
  solidarity on a federal level.</p>

  <p>Greater autonomy for the individual republics did not alone pull them in a
  centrifugal direction against socialist centralization. It could just mean a greater
  amount of local democracy and more equality among the individual republics.</p>

  <p>The problem arises, however, because of the Gorbachev administration's perspective
  to decentralize socialist planning, weaken the public ownership of the means of
  production, and open the road to private ownership. This is what causes and strengthens
  centrifugal forces.</p>

  <p>The effort to decentralize the entire economy holds the danger of opening up the
  Soviet Union to the predatory imperialist monopolies. Inviting the imperialist
  monopolies for development as was done in the 1970s and during the NEP period may have
  posed some political risks. But, if the development plans had been completed according
  to an agreed upon schedule, they could certainly have been of great help in the pursuit
  of socialist construction. Joint ventures, on the basis of permitting the capitalists
  to garner super-profits on a so-called 50-50 basis as laid out in the current
  proposals, hold greater risks for the socialist economy.</p>

  <h4>Danger of joint ventures</h4>

  <p>The danger, if these joint ventures are consummated, has to be seen in light of the
  new powers that have been granted to the directors and managers of the industrial
  enterprises, who have been given wide latitude in relation to the accumulation and
  division of profits.</p>

  <p>The directors' and managers' increased independence, not only from the federal
  government but from the individual state, creates one of the most formidable openings
  for economic invasion and political subversion of the USSR by the imperialist
  monopolies. The specifics of each joint venture under these circumstances may spell out
  a dangerous penetration of the Soviet economy by the very monopolies against which the
  October Revolution was carried out in the first place.</p>

  <p>In addition, bourgeois decentralization reawakens old national animosities,
  particularly when they involve property rights. The rebellions first set off in
  Kazakhstan, which then spread to Armenia, Azerbaijan and other areas, where the
  Gorbachev administration called out Soviet troops to quell the uprising, all followed
  the pursuit of anti-socialist reforms which generated national animosities.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois character of the Soviet economic reforms breeds chauvinism at home.
  And this will inevitably have its impact abroad on Soviet foreign policy.</p>

  <p>One can only hope that the reports in the New York Times are false. If the reports
  prove to be true, however, it goes without saying that the actions of the Gorbachev
  administration must be severely condemned. But this should in no way be utilized to
  disqualify the USSR as a workers' state or negate its possibilities to recover from the
  social and political bourgeois deformations imposed on the USSR by the Gorbachev
  administration and the leaderships which succeeded the Leninist government.</p>

  <p>Whatever the case may be, one can only hope that the revolutionary class
  consciousness of the Soviet working class will rise to the historic occasion and
  deliver the kind of rebuff to Gorbachev and his grouping which they so richly
  deserve.</p>
