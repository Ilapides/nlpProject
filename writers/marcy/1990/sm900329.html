  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Significance of the Communist vote in the GDR (March

  <h1>Significance of the Communist vote in the GDR</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 29, 1990)</h5>

  <p>The great surprise of the March 18 election in the German Democratic Republic was
  not that the pro-imperialist, right-wing parties obtained a landslide victory. That was
  a foregone conclusion. Even a casual observer of the international scene as it affects
  the European situation would have known that.</p>

  <p>The counterrevolutionary trend which was sweeping Eastern Europe and which had
  originated with the bourgeois reforms and international initiatives of the Gorbachev
  administration was sure to reach the GDR, notwithstanding the resistance of the former
  Honecker leadership.</p>

  <h4>`A strong third'</h4>

  <p>The real surprise of the election was that the Communists (the Party for Democratic
  Socialism &mdash; PDS), as the New York Times grudgingly admits, "finished a
  surprisingly strong third" with 16.3%. The Kohls, the Thatchers, the Bushes and the
  Mitterrands had all hoped that this election would deliver the coup de grace to
  socialism, would finish off the epoch of socialist struggle on the European arena that
  began with the October Revolution.</p>

  <p>Not quite so. The vote in terms of parliamentary significance might amount to
  little. But going beyond surface manifestations, it holds the deepest significance for
  the class struggle coming at this historical point.</p>

  <h4>Reactionary dreams of empire</h4>

  <p>West German leader Helmut Kohl and his contemporary imperialist counterparts are
  reckoning the same way Napoleon III did after his coup d'etat in 1852. He thought that
  the crushing of the proletarian revolutions of 1848 had forever ended the struggle for
  socialism and the revolutionary transformation of capitalist society.</p>

  <p>The Paris Commune of 1871 showed that the class struggle was alive and that
  Napoleon's dream of a European empire had died. Even the death of thousands of
  Communards did not signal the decline of the proletarian class struggle, but opened up
  a new era in which the class struggle was fought on a broader, more continentwide
  arena.</p>

  <p>And when Otto von Bismarck took over the reins of power in Germany, did he not also
  think that by invoking the Anti-Socialist Laws, by imprisoning the principal leaders of
  the working class, by muzzling the press, by maneuvering with the counterrevolutionary
  Junkers and the equally counterrevolutionary liberal bourgeoisie, that his
  statesmanship would not only open the road for a unified Germany but would expand its
  frontiers and usher in a really great role for Germany as a world power?</p>

  <p>And what of the social legislation extracted through the workers' struggles?
  Bismarck, who saw it as solely the product of his own genius, thought such concessions
  would forever end the class struggle for socialism in Germany.</p>

  <p>How wrong he was.</p>

  <p>What was Hitler's dream? In the name of the "National Socialist Workers Party," he
  thought he would so destroy the movement of the working class, root and branch, that it
  couldn't present a danger for the next thousand years. But that proved to be an
  hallucination.</p>

  <p>What real difference is there, from the point of view of the anatomy of the
  capitalist system, between Hitler's dream of a unified Europe under his domination and
  that of Kohl, Thatcher, and Bush? Behind the exuberance of the imperialist bourgeoisie
  there lurk the same old capitalist rivalries, poisonous in themselves, whose toxicity
  is sure to bring convulsions similar to the capitalist collapse of 1929 which really
  brought Hitler to power.</p>

  <h4>Free elections in 1932 and 1990</h4>

  <p>The capitalist press unendingly refers to the March 18, 1990, election as "the first
  free election since Hitler abolished the Weimar Republic in 1933."</p>

  <p>Yes, it was a free election, the same kind that bourgeois parliamentarism allowed in
  the historical circumstances of the early 1930s. But would the Sulzberger dynasty, the
  Knight-Ridder chain, the Chicago Tribune-New York Daily News syndicate, or the Los
  Angeles Times-Newsday syndicate dare to compare it to the 1932 free election which
  ushered Hitler into power?</p>

  <p>What were the conditions then? Were they similar to what has now taken place in the
  GDR?</p>

  <p>In 1932, there had been a reign of terror by the Nazis, with bands of storm troopers
  attacking workers' leaders and even murdering leading Communists in their homes. A
  worldwide press campaign presented Germany as on the verge of collapse because of the
  economic crisis. Only a "strong Germany" could "save the republic."</p>

  <p>The situation had reached a crossroads. Which way would Germany go? It would either
  choose a genuine socialist road, with the takeover of industry and the expropriation of
  the bankers and industrialists, or it would continue to be bogged down in bourgeois
  manipulation without in any way changing the economic course. Each of the principal
  organizations &mdash; the Communists, the Social Democrats, the Nazis, and the middle
  parties of the right &mdash; had already armed to one degree or another in preparation
  for the struggle.</p>

  <p>In the November 1932 national election, the Nazi vote declined from the previous
  election in July (down to 33.1% from 37.2%), while the Communist vote increased from
  14.3% to 16.9%. The Social Democrats declined slightly to 20.7%, but the combined vote
  for the two working class parties (37.6%) put them ahead of the Nazis.</p>

  <h4>`Democratic' right joins Hitler</h4>

  <p>Hitler had received only a plurality, and thus his appointment as chancellor was not
  at all a foregone conclusion. However, the middle right, the democratic right as it was
  called, veered to the side of Hitler. Hitler formed a coalition with them and opened a
  reign of terror against the Communists.</p>

  <p>The president of the Weimar Republic was none other than the former
  commander-in-chief of the German armies, Paul von Hindenburg, referred to by the New
  York Times in a memorable editorial of the time as a tower of strength who would
  prevent fascism in Germany or a dictatorship of the Communists.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, in January 1933 von Hindenburg called on Hitler to become chancellor,
  authorizing him to form a government. Money poured into the coffers of the Nazi party
  from the big industrialists. Just a month later came the fire that burned the
  Reichstag, the German parliament. Immediately the Nazis blamed it on the Communists,
  and this infamous frameup became the watchword for a violent witch hunt.</p>

  <p>Five days after the Reichstag fire, the last "free election" took place. Even in
  this atmosphere of extreme violence and hysteria, the Nazi party received only 43.9% of
  the popular vote. However, the Nazis declared the results of the March 5, 1933,
  election to be a grand victory for their party.</p>

  <p>The petty bourgeoisie in particular had been stampeded into the camp of Nazism
  &mdash; on fear and false promises, of course. But it was a free election, according to
  the bourgeoisie at the time. To them it was preferable to having a socialist overturn
  which would end the economic crisis brought on by the Versailles Treaty and the
  worldwide capitalist depression.</p>

  <p>That was a free election, real freedom. But was there really choice in the havoc
  created by the world capitalist crisis?</p>

  <p>The day after the Reichstag fire, the Hitler-Papen government issued an emergency
  decree suspending civil liberties. Under the constitution, this was supposed to be only
  temporary. But it became the basis for the establishment of an open dictatorship by the
  Nazis. As the first condition in the preparation for the next imperialist war, the
  Communist Party was illegalized, its leaders arrested and imprisoned.</p>

  <h4>Elections stepping stone to fascism</h4>

  <p>The so-called free elections were really a stepping stone for German imperialist
  finance to embrace fascism rather than to face the possibility of a workers' state in
  the heartland of Europe. Nobody understood this better than the imperialist financiers
  from London to Paris to New York, who had been draining Germany of its capital in the
  post-war period by demanding reparations (the Dawes and Young plans), but sharply eased
  up later and paved the way for Hitler as against the Communists, whom they viewed as
  the greatest danger.</p>

  <p>How is the present election to be regarded? It took place under conditions of a cold
  political counterrevolution, in part engineered or at the least inspired by the
  Gorbachev bourgeois reformers. The gates to imperialism were first opened by the
  Hungarian renegade communist leaders. They violated their treaty with a sister
  socialist state specifying that emigration could only be opened up by mutual agreement.
  But the Hungarian regime conspired with the Bonn authorities and with Washington, as
  well as other imperialist countries, opening up the dismantling of the socialist
  republic in the GDR.</p>

  <p>History will show that it really wasn't the opening of the Berlin wall that
  accounted for the dismantling of the GDR. It was the invasion of billions and billions
  of marks and dollars, which resulted in the counterrevolutionary destruction of a good
  part of the party. Armed force could not have done a better job.</p>

  <h4>German party `persuaded' to self-destruct</h4>

  <p>The party leadership was persuaded by Gorbachev himself and his grouping to
  self-destruct, an act which can only be accounted for by seeing that the party had
  suddenly lost its moorings under the severe double pressure of imperialism and the
  Gorbachev bourgeois reformers. The leaders were "persuaded" to resign, and their
  seconds in command were "persuaded" to denounce the former leaders.</p>

  <p>It is said that the worst wounds are those that are self-inflicted. The party
  leaders took the road of self-destruction, denouncing each other in almost a bizarre
  manner, whereas just the other day they had been friends and comrades.</p>

  <p>They feared an open struggle. They feared a Tiananmen Square. They were cajoled,
  bulldozed, threatened, intimidated and above all confused. A sad spectacle for a party
  which showed such confidence only a short while ago.</p>

  <p>The counterrevolution had a jubilant heyday. Parliamentary trickery was the means to
  take advantage of the total confusion. Why a party should suddenly destroy its own
  leadership, go back on its own traditions, can only be explained by the fact that it
  feared civil war and was convinced it would lose. Unlike the Paris Communards, who
  imparted so much revolutionary energy to the world proletariat, it chose the
  ignominious road of self-flagellation, indictment of itself, giving false testimony
  against itself and its leaders.</p>

  <p>Was it not so during the great French Revolution, whose leaders were convicted as
  agents of England? Need we mention the confessions during the purge trials in the USSR,
  which the bourgeois reformers have exposed, not to revive revolutionary Marxism but to
  bury it?</p>

  <p>So the masses were driven in the direction of Bonn. There seemed nothing else left
  to do.</p>

  <p>It seemed a repeat performance of how the masses were driven into Hitler's ranks. It
  was a free election then. It's a free election now. Nevertheless, in 1932 the
  Communists in Germany polled 6 million votes. The capitalist press was surprised by the
  size of the vote.</p>

  <h4>Not all driven into the arms of Bonn</h4>

  <p>They are also surprised that so many people &mdash; over a million and a half
  &mdash; voted today for the Communists, in spite of the incipient terror being prepared
  for them. The capitalist press had assumed the PDS would get around 3-5%.</p>

  <p>What did the vote really show? That at least a million and a half people didn't lose
  their heads. But there is also a broader lesson in the enduring tradition of socialism
  in Germany. The party may have changed its name, even its goal. Nevertheless, it was
  still the party with which they identified and the general direction was still
  socialist. The last thing a class-conscious worker gives up is his/her party &mdash;
  unless they have a choice between that and a new, more progressive and revolutionary
  workers' party.</p>

  <p>Bismarck in the 1890s thought he would rub out the workers' movement with his
  Anti-Socialist Laws. But they ultimately proved bankrupt. Socialism was regenerated
  even when its leaders followed an opportunist policy. The movement grew in numbers and
  breadth.</p>

  <p>There is an element of regeneration in today's surprising vote. It shows the
  enduring quality of the workers' movement which cannot be rubbed out. The class
  struggle may wane at times, may be distorted and sent in reactionary directions, but in
  a modern, highly industrialized country, proletarian class consciousness will be
  revived because the class struggle pushes it on.</p>

  <p>You can abolish political parties and jail their leaders. The capitalist press and
  politicians can confuse and manipulate the electorate. That's what bourgeois
  parliamentarism is all about. But the class struggle arises from the utter
  irreconcilability of the social character of capitalist production with the private
  character of capitalist ownership.</p>

  <p>This the bourgeoisie cannot abolish without abolishing itself. And it is only the
  proletariat that can do that.</p>
