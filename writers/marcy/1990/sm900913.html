  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Bush, Gorbachev and the war crisis (Sept. 13,
  1990)</title>

  <h1>Bush, Gorbachev and the war crisis</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Sept. 13, 1990)</h5>

  <p>September 4 &mdash; Secretary General of the United Nations Javier Perez de Cuellar
  went way beyond the scope of his authority when he met with the foreign minister of
  Iraq and then, instead of directly reporting back to the UN Security Council, publicly
  stated that the Iraqi government stood firm on its unwillingness to withdraw from
  Kuwait, in effect blaming the Iraqi government for the deepening of the crisis. The
  whole course of his press conference put the Iraqi government in a negative light.</p>

  <p>As the administrative officer for the UN, he is authorized to engage in dialogue
  with member states, to report back on his deliberations to the UN Security Council, and
  make suggestions on that basis. However, his public statements put the onus on Iraq and
  at the same time shift the crisis away from the UN and towards a solution of the
  problem at the so-called "superpowers" meeting to be held this coming weekend between
  the U.S. and the USSR in Helsinki.</p>

  <h4>Bush and Gorbachev</h4>

  <p>The Helsinki meeting was initiated in great haste by Bush himself, in order to
  fortify the position of U.S. imperialism by getting the cooperation of the Gorbachev
  administration. It comes at a time when the latter has just made an economic agreement
  with the pro-imperialist, pro-capitalist Yeltsin grouping which marks a giant step
  toward the restoration of capitalism in the USSR.</p>

  <p>Whether it can be implemented depends solely on whether the masses of workers,
  peasants and progressive intelligentsia realize the enormity of this development. In
  the meantime, the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie in the USSR is doing everything in
  its power to sabotage the socialist economy and discredit socialist achievements in
  general.</p>

  <p>During the darkest days of the Second World War, when both Moscow and Leningrad were
  under siege by the Nazis, bread was made available to the people through rationing.
  There was never a real bread crisis in the Soviet Union, despite the brutal destruction
  wreaked by the Nazis.</p>

  <p>But today the Western media reports there is no bread in Moscow. How can this be? It
  is an <strong>artificial shortage</strong>, deliberately created by bourgeois elements
  for the purposes of abolishing socialist planning, widening the capitalist market, and
  opening the doors wide to the imperialist monopolies.</p>

  <p>The Bush administration sees this as a good time to take advantage of the USSR's
  internal crisis in order to get cooperation from Gorbachev in the military adventure of
  U.S. imperialism against the entire Arabian peninsula.</p>

  <h4>U.S. strike force deployed</h4>

  <p>Even before Bush arrives in Helsinki, the U.S. press is acknowledging that U.S.
  military aircraft have secretly been deployed in untold numbers throughout the entire
  Gulf area, including Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

  <p>As we have stressed in these pages over the last weeks, the Security Council passed
  resolutions on Aug. 2, 6 and 9 imposing an embargo against Iraq and authorizing the
  boarding, inspection and verification of vessels suspected of carrying goods destined
  for Iraq prohibited by the embargo. The U.S. and other imperialist powers have
  interpreted this as authorization for a naval blockade.</p>

  <p>The Security Council arrived at these crucial decisions during six long days and
  nights of talks in dead secrecy. Nothing about the discussions came out in public. No
  authorized representative of the UN even gave a summary of the nature of the
  discussions. Only the U.S. representative, Thomas Pickering, gave his version of what
  happened, in which he as much as said that the Security Council had authorized the use
  of force &mdash; a phrase not found in any of the resolutions.</p>

  <p>Governments with parliamentary institutions are presumably obligated to report to
  them on questions of war and peace. When it comes to possible hostilities, they are
  obligated to get the approval of their respective parliamentary institutions before,
  not after, the fact. But none of this has happened so far.</p>

  <h4>Usurpation of war powers</h4>

  <p>The Bush administration in particular disregarded not only the constitutional
  provisions which empower Congress alone with the authority to declare war, but also the
  War Powers Act of 1973. The latter was supposed to plug each and every loophole so that
  the military could no longer usurp congressional authority and move in troops en masse,
  virtually creating a war crisis without any color of constitutional or legislative
  procedures.</p>

  <p>Whence comes all this secrecy in the high councils of government regarding matters
  of life and death? Who are the driving forces keeping it all so hush-hush?</p>

  <p>Secrecy is a characteristic feature of the so-called Seven Sisters, the seven major
  oil companies which have controlled the production, refining and marketing of all
  Middle East oil. They are most concerned with the oil in the Arabian peninsula, which
  they have considered their turf dating back more than 70 years.</p>

  <p>Who are they?</p>

  <p>The seven are Exxon, Gulf, Texaco, Mobil, Standard Oil of California, British
  Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell.</p>

  <p>Their infamous exploits are recounted in detail in a number of books, the more
  authoritative being <em>The Seven Sisters,</em> by Anthony Sampson (Viking, 1975);
  <em>Oil and World Power,</em> by Peter Odell (Pelican, 1983); and the most readable,
  <em>The Empire of Oil,</em> by Harvey O'Connor (Monthly Review Press, 1955).</p>

  <h4>British carved out Kuwait</h4>

  <p>Only in the last few days have the Washington Post, the New York Times and the Los
  Angeles Times begun to slightly lift the veil of the avaricious and extortionate empire
  that controls the vital arteries of life on the Arabian peninsula. For instance, the
  Washington Post of Aug. 31 finally revealed that "in late November 1922 ... the modern
  borders of Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were established by British imperial fiat."
  The British representative to the Uqair Conference in the Arabian desert, Colonel Sir
  Percy Cox, "himself drew what became the Kuwait-Iraq border." Cox was a representative
  of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.</p>

  <p>This validates what Saddam Hussein himself had said in an Aug. 10 address, that
  "Western colonialism divided and established weak states ruled by [royal] families that
  offered [the colonialist] services that facilitated his mission. The colonialists, to
  ensure their petroleum interests ... set up these disfigured petroleum states."</p>

  <p>For background to the historical evolution of the empire of oil, see Ida Tarbell's
  excellent account, <em>The History of the Standard Oil Company.</em> An understanding
  of the evolution of the Rockefeller fortune will help in following the ins and outs of
  the struggle of these seven potentates and their lesser brothers and sisters, which
  seem to be forever engaged in secret alliances, coups, efforts at bribing the governing
  groups in these countries and setting one group against another. When that fails, they
  are adept at obtaining the open intervention of their respective imperialist
  governments.</p>

  <h4>Long history of oil intrigue</h4>

  <p>What is at stake in the current crisis is the fabulous empire of oil on the entire
  Arabian peninsula, and particularly the vast oil reserves of Iraq itself. This is
  completely left out in the current discussion in the imperialist press.</p>

  <p>The first foreign company to establish itself in Iraq was the Iraq Petroleum
  Company, as early as 1914. Iraq was then under the control of the Ottoman Empire
  (Turkey).</p>

  <p>Two years later a secret agreement (the Sykes-Picot treaty) was signed between
  Britain and France to divide the Arabian peninsula between themselves once Germany was
  defeated and the Ottoman Empire disintegrated. This treaty stipulated that control of
  the IPC would pass to the hands of the British. Subsequently Gulf Oil of the U.S.
  obtained an interest in it.</p>

  <p>Over the next 70 years, virtually every area of political struggle in Iraq revolved
  around the progressive, anti-imperialist forces trying to get rid of the oil companies
  while the reactionary stooges, who became their virtual prisoners, tried to retain
  them. Since the early twenties, when British Petroleum, Gulf and several others got
  control of the flow of oil in Iraq, there has been one relentless struggle between the
  people and the various administrations of the government, leading to coups of one sort
  or another. The underlying factor was always not just political sovereignty but the
  ownership and control of the oil by the foreign imperialist oil monopolies.</p>

  <p>The Iraqi Revolution of 1958 nationalized some aspects of the oil industry, but the
  oil companies retained a percentage of the oil and paid royalties to the government. It
  was only in 1972, 14 years later, that the Iraqi government finally dislodged the
  foreign companies from ownership and control of these vast oil fields.</p>

  <p>Says Peter Odell in <em>Oil and World Power,</em> "Just the essential communications
  infrastructure of these U.S.A.-centered international firms rivals that of the foreign
  services of the majority of the world's nations, and they are indeed in the forefront
  of the efforts to secure private, global communications by means of orbiting
  satellites."</p>

  <p>Taken together, their resources rival even the U.S. State Department!</p>

  <h4>Secrecy imposed by oil monopolies</h4>

  <p>The secrecy at the UN reflects the secrecy of these global oil monopolies. Secrecy
  is their indispensable weapon in the struggle to blind public opinion to their
  worldwide illegal operations. It is they, together with the military-industrial
  complex, the banks and the Bush government, which have imposed this secrecy upon the UN
  Security Council.</p>

  <p>These secret agreements are reflected in the U.S. government's fundamental policy.
  In Washington's view, the interests of the oil monopolies are identical to the
  so-called U.S. national interest.</p>

  <p>While the secret treaties have undergone many revisions, their essence remains
  &mdash; the robbery and exploitation of the wealth of oppressed peoples, and the
  redivision of this booty among the principal predatory imperialist powers. This is the
  essence of the war crisis right now.</p>

  <p>The Seven Sisters are the source of constant internal instability in the
  oil-producing countries precisely because of the cutthroat competition among them in
  the search for areas of oil exploration.</p>

  <p>A current example would be Yemen, where the oil company owned by the Texas-based
  Hunt family has the sole right to explore for, pump and market the oil. At present, it
  is apparently on friendly terms with the Yemeni government and is not interfering in
  its internal affairs. But what usually happens to upset such a relationship is that
  another company attempts to get in on the oil exploration and drilling. If the
  government turns it down, the struggle between the two oil companies can have grave
  consequences. Either the government is overturned or becomes a pliant tool of one or
  both in the process of the struggle between the oil companies.</p>

  <h4>The Seven Sisters redivide markets</h4>

  <p>The Seven Sisters have decided to reshuffle the agreements that have existed since
  the end of the Second World War. Advances in technology and the changing economic
  patterns of power have made it necessary for the imperialists to reconsider some of the
  older agreements and establish a new <em>modus vivendi</em>.</p>

  <p>As we have stated in earlier articles, the agreements to redivide markets and
  resources are secret, but occasionally because of rivalries and irreconcilable
  disagreements among the predators, some information is leaked to those most friendly in
  the media or the press. Thus, William Buckley in his column of Aug. 31 (New York Daily
  News) revealed:</p>

  <p>"When the dust settles on the current crisis, and that may be sooner than projected
  by those who think in terms of blockades lasting through the winter, we should have a
  long-term contract with Saudi Arabia."</p>

  <p>A contract presupposes an agreement that is arrived at by both parties, without
  coercion or compulsion of any kind. Otherwise the agreement is null and void.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Buckley goes on, "The parties would be the U.S., Japan, Canada, Italy,
  Germany, France and the United Kingdom."</p>

  <p>Those are the very same imperialist powers engaged in the present conflict! They're
  the ones pushing for the redivision of world markets and sources of raw materials, as
  they did during the first and second world wars. The model was the 1916 Sykes-Picot
  agreement. All of this is undertaken under the mandatory stimulus of the giant
  multinational oil companies.</p>

  <p>"The signatory nations," says Buckley, "would guarantee the independence of Saudi
  Arabia."</p>

  <p>Some independence!</p>

  <p>"In return, Saudi Arabia would sell oil over the next 15 years to each of the
  signatory powers in quantities of up to 150% of the signatories' purchases in 1989. The
  price would be the same as the price of oil on the free market in Galveston,
  Texas."</p>

  <h4>What about anti-trust act?</h4>

  <p>This is precisely the kind of illegal combination that was outlawed by the original
  Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, which the big oil corporations have whittled down over
  the years, making the anti-trust law a dead letter as far as the oil monopolies are
  concerned.</p>

  <p>The agreement revealed by Buckley is characteristic of the consortiums or cartels
  which the giant oil companies have formed and re-formed dozens of times in controlling
  the world's oil supply. They set quotas (up to 150% of the 1989 level), time limits or
  duration of contract, decide who sells the oil, even who can buy it, and how the price
  will be determined &mdash; and all this constitutes the secret way consortiums or
  cartels operate. They are the greatest menace, even to the orderly functioning of a
  capitalist government.</p>

  <p>Such consortiums are directed particularly against oppressed countries who do not
  have oil or are not clients of the big imperialist powers and thus find it difficult to
  obtain oil on the basis of the so-called free market. Such agreements constitute in
  effect a monopolistic restraint upon trade.</p>

  <p>Finally, with respect to the independence of Saudi Arabia, Buckley's revelations are
  interesting because they represent a leak from the Bush administration &mdash; or
  rather the Bush-Reagan administration, since Reagan appears on television regularly to
  boost the National Review, the mouthpiece of Buckley and of the giant monopolies.</p>

  <p>The independence of Saudi Arabia would be guaranteed by "enough troops and
  facilities to guard against a blitzkrieg.... Any objection raised on the grounds that
  there might be a political evolution within Saudi Arabia in the direction of a
  democratic government would be irrelevant."</p>

  <p>So the overthrow of the monarchy or establishment of a democratic government is
  irrelevant!</p>

  <p>Why? Because the agreement "guarantees the freedom of Saudi Arabia, not the present
  government. And any new government that followed would be held to existing
  arrangements."</p>

  <p>Then comes the coup de grace. "Once the document has been signed, OPEC is finished."
  So you see, one of the principal aims of the war is <strong>to finish off OPEC, to take
  full control of the oil resources of the entire peninsula</strong>. Part of the oil
  would remain under the nominal control of Saudi Arabia, which of course would remain an
  occupied country.</p>

  <p>How foolish it is for our liberals to join the reactionary capitalist establishment,
  which is shedding a Niagara of crocodile tears over tiny Kuwait! This is not the issue.
  It is a red herring thrown in to confuse the masses, no different than the
  assassination of the Archduke of Austria, which was seized upon by the imperialist
  bandits to drag the masses into World War I.</p>

  <h4>Marxism vs. bourgeois liberalism</h4>

  <p>What then is the fundamental difference between Marxism and bourgeois liberalism as
  regards just and unjust wars?</p>

  <p>The Marxist conception of the struggle against war arises from the nature of the
  capitalist system, which is driven like an engine in the pursuit of super-profits and
  must constantly expand in order to guarantee these profits. It is incapable of having a
  consistent peace policy, even when it attempts to do so.</p>

  <p>Liberals, on the other hand, divorce the politics of the capitalist government from
  its economic anatomy and class structure. They most often take the view that military
  intervention by a capitalist state is the result of a mistaken policy. They do not see
  or do not wish to see that the political policy flows from the economic needs and
  structure of capitalism. More often than not, they blame the particular administration
  or governing group at the time for the war, not taking cognizance of what Marxists have
  always known, that any particular administration of the capitalist state is merely the
  executive committee of that state and functions on behalf of the capitalist class.</p>

  <p>Liberalism separates politics from economics. Instead of taking a class view of any
  particular struggle, either foreign or domestic, they substitute bourgeois morality for
  class politics. This prevents them and all who follow them from taking a thoroughly
  progressive and revolutionary view of the evolving capitalist system, which has moved
  in the last century from a relatively competitive stage of development into a
  monopolist, decadent one. Resorting to repression and violence abroad has become a
  characteristic and inseparable feature of the system.</p>

  <p>Moreover, a diplomatic solution can become just as onerous as a military one,
  depending on what the solution is! Buckley's solution is a diplomatic one. If you ask
  France, Britain and the U.S., all the interventions have come about because of the
  failure of diplomacy on the side of the oppressed, not the oppressors. The condemnation
  of Iraq with respect to Kuwait is to put an equal sign between the oppressor and the
  oppressed.</p>

  <p>The liberal elements are entranced with all the talk about a diplomatic solution,
  failing to see that the proponents of an immediate strike are using diplomacy as a
  cover to give the Pentagon time to get its troops and weapons in place for a "swift,
  simultaneous and lethal strike." Who is the leading spokesperson of such a course? None
  other than Henry Kissinger, former secretary of state and national security adviser
  under the Nixon administration and protege of the oil-rich Rockefellers. ("Saddam Must
  Go Quickly," New York Post, Aug. 20.)</p>

  <p>With respect to the issue of a diplomatic or military solution, Kissinger says "it
  is important to understand that America has crossed its Rubicon."</p>

  <p>Kissinger's conclusion is given force by today's revelation that the U.S. is
  militarizing not only Saudi Arabia but the entire Gulf area.</p>
