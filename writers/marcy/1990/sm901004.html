  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Behind Gorbachev's emergency powers (Oct. 4,
  1990)</title>

  <h1>Behind Gorbachev's emergency powers</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Oct. 4, 1990)</h5>

  <p>September 25 &mdash; The Supreme Soviet in an overwhelming vote &mdash; 305 to 36
  &mdash; two days ago granted to Gorbachev sweeping powers to transform social and
  economic relations in the USSR.</p>

  <p>The kind of authority the Soviet parliament gave him is on a par with that granted
  to prime ministers or presidents during wartime or in periods of acute economic, social
  and political struggle. It is reported that Gorbachev will have the authority to put
  into effect policies on wages and prices, finances and the budget and to issue decrees
  "strengthening law and order."</p>

  <p>It would seem that this was a real vote of confidence from all the factions.
  Actually, the opposite is all too true.</p>

  <h4>Opposing factions pass the buck</h4>

  <p>Gorbachev's centrism is now based on the polarization of two opposing class camps.
  Each one refuses to take responsibility for fully dismantling the socialist system,
  which would precipitate a huge cut in living standards from spiraling prices, a fall in
  wages and surging unemployment. So they have passed the buck to Gorbachev, the miracle
  man, who is expected to satisfy both class camps. This explains the huge vote. A fine
  vote of confidence!</p>

  <p>To understand the situation as it exists currently, one must take into account that
  Gorbachev just the other day appeared the classical centrist, veering from one side to
  the other, making concessions first to one and then the other.</p>

  <p>Thus, last weekend, he seemed to have abandoned his old ally, Prime Minister Nikolai
  Ryzhkov, by tacitly rejecting his economic plan and arriving at an agreement with Boris
  Yeltsin, the leader of the bourgeois opposition in the Soviet Union and the president
  of the Russian Republic. The essence of the agreement was to abandon and destroy
  whatever still remains of socialist planning and ownership of the means of production
  in favor of the restoration of capitalism.</p>

  <p>The fine print of their document, allegedly drawn up by a team of economists and
  politicians reflecting the views of Yeltsin, and only in part those of Gorbachev, was
  not made available here. But reports indicate it is nothing less than a full-scale
  capitalist restoration, to usher in full market relations after 500 days.</p>

  <p>Ryzhkov, whose plan for economic rehabilitation, while going very far in dismantling
  socialist construction, did not go far enough to suit the bourgeois elements, should by
  all rules of ordinary parliamentary procedure have resigned his post in protest at
  Gorbachev's desertion.</p>

  <p>Then, however, Gorbachev recoiled somewhat. He proposed a national referendum on the
  privatization of land, which he borrowed from Ligachev, the former leader of the
  "conservative" CP position. This move is illustrative of his general political makeup
  as well as his personal idiosyncrasies. He, more than any other leader in contemporary
  times, both East and West, seems to be the incarnation of centrism.</p>

  <h4>Centrism in ordinary times</h4>

  <p>Centrism as a political tendency in the bourgeois parliamentary system thrives best
  when social relations are relatively stable and political struggles even take on a
  gentlemanly character. Under those conditions, obscure capitalist politicians who would
  ordinarily be regarded as little more than nonentities suddenly assume a posture of
  extraordinary importance, if for no other reason than that they lend themselves to
  becoming instruments of political compromise.</p>

  <p>This happens most frequently when both camps in the parliamentary system see no
  great urgency to conduct an all-out battle which might lead to raised voices and hot
  tempers. Such a situation would make compromise difficult if not impossible precisely
  when compromise is what they need most.</p>

  <p>Centrism as a political tendency, therefore, under those circumstances, may assume
  great importance in averting a political crisis. An individual who becomes the leader
  of the centrist grouping may suddenly appear as a tower of strength, tact and strategic
  conception. In a word, an eminent statesman. This happens frequently in all the
  bourgeois parliaments &mdash; British, French, Italian, Japanese, and of course, the
  U.S. Congress.</p>

  <p>Such a situation can prevail as long as there is not one of those inevitable
  resurgences of class strife to upset the equilibrium of the social and political forces
  at work within the social system. But should there be a resurgence of the class
  struggle, the extremes of both sides of the bourgeois parliamentary system could become
  battered by the growing size of the centrist camp, of those who abhor the struggle and
  demand class peace and capitalist stability. That is when the centrist leader appears
  as nothing less than a miracle man.</p>

  <p>When the struggle between the two social systems has not fully matured, compromise
  is still possible. And individual leaders, who otherwise are opposed to compromise,
  suddenly become its very incarnation.</p>

  <h4>Centrism in times of crisis</h4>

  <p>Matters are altogether different when centrism as a political tendency emerges at a
  time of really deep social crisis, a crisis of the system itself. When the social
  system seems to be fracturing, when the crisis is actually the result of the emergence
  of two irreconcilable class camps representing diametrically opposed social systems,
  compromise then becomes very precarious if not impossible.</p>

  <p>Such, for instance, was the case of Henry Clay (1777-1852), a famous U.S. Senator
  from Kentucky. In the war of 1812 against Britain, he was a war hawk. But later, as the
  struggle between the slavocracy and the Northern bourgeoisie fully emerged, he became
  the representative of compromise. He often denounced the "extremists" on both sides,
  putting the slavocracy and the Northern bourgeoisie in one pot. He was the chief
  architect of the famous Missouri compromise.</p>

  <p>But it was to no avail. The struggle between the Northern bourgeoisie and the
  Southern slavocracy was of an irreconcilable social character because one was based on
  the exploitation of wage labor and the other on chattel slavery. The two could not
  coexist for any length of time. The rapid internal dynamic of capitalist development
  was bound to collide with and overwhelm the stagnant slaveholding system, which could
  only expand geographically.</p>

  <p>This analogy should help us in trying to understand the nature of the struggle in
  the Soviet Union.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev's type of centrism</h4>

  <p>The ascendancy of Gorbachev as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the
  Soviet Union signaled the emergence of a new political tendency in the USSR.</p>

  <p>Until yesterday, Gorbachev was universally recognized by the imperialist bourgeoisie
  as the epitome of centrism in the internal domestic struggle of the USSR. Centrism is
  not a new current in the political history of the Soviet Union. The struggle of right,
  left, and center marks the entire history of Bolshevism and the USSR.</p>

  <p>However, all previous political struggles in the USSR, both during and after the
  Leninist government, took place on the social foundation of a workers' state, no matter
  how ill-formed, bureaucratized and debilitated by long and exhausting civil war and
  imperialist intervention it might have been. The struggles of left, right and center,
  whether mistaken in their approach or not, were all over how to preserve and retain
  that foundation.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Stalin's struggle against Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky on the
  right, and Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev on the left, was characterized by the latter
  group as reflecting bureaucratic centrism on the foundations of a workers' state.</p>

  <p>All the Soviet leaders after Lenin stood on the platform of achieving coexistence
  with the imperialist bourgeoisie. Abandoning the perspective of world revolution (which
  prevailed during the Leninist epoch) was a measure which strengthened the possibility,
  but not the inevitability, of coexistence. All the successors of Lenin tried to build a
  foreign policy on that basis.</p>

  <p>But Gorbachev went far beyond that. Instead of the basic platform of coexistence
  with imperialism, Gorbachev went over to the thesis of the late Sakharov, the outright
  bourgeois restorationist, that there could be a convergence of the two systems.</p>

  <p>As a sociological conception, this is proving to be an illusion altogether. The two
  social systems, which are based on two antagonistic classes, grew further apart.
  Gorbachev then abandoned his original hope for convergence and proceeded to attempt the
  integration of the Soviet system into the world capitalist economy, an altogether
  radical departure from any of the conceptions held by previous Soviet leaders.</p>

  <p>What it amounted to in terms of practical politics was the opening up of the USSR to
  the imperialist monopolies. The Gorbachev program in foreign affairs could not but be
  the most devastating blow to the East European governments, especially Poland and
  Hungary, which already were burdened by heavy indebtedness to imperialist banks.</p>

  <h4>Imperialists caught on early</h4>

  <p>When Gorbachev first became General Secretary, he emerged under the signpost of
  glasnost and restructuring of industry, a virtually unbeatable program for his time. If
  only he had lived up to it!</p>

  <p>But what did glasnost turn out to be? It was soon clear that it meant giving
  unfettered rein to bourgeois elements in the Soviet Union while restricting, if not
  muzzling (certainly not making available to the broad public) any progressive, let
  alone revolutionary socialist, criticism of the Gorbachev regime and its ultimate
  program.</p>

  <p>It did not take long for the imperialist bourgeoisie to recognize that the Gorbachev
  leadership represented something new, not the classical centrist tendency in the
  framework of the existing social and political structure of the USSR. It was preparing
  a departure from the very framework of a planned economy, from state ownership of the
  means of production buttressed by collective and state farms.</p>

  <p>Before too long, his economic program revealed itself to be not a major forward step
  in the scientific and technological revolution, but rather a restructuring of the
  social groupings in the USSR. While his first pronouncements seemed to promise a
  narrowing of social inequality, consonant with the goal of communism, the practical
  impact of his reforms was to widen and deepen social inequality.</p>

  <p>Sooner than anyone expected, the attack against the working class took on the
  ancient form of the early bourgeoisie against the proletariat. A vicious struggle was
  unloosed in the Gorbachev-controlled press against unnamed "levelers," workers who
  sought not so much to tear down the considerable privileges of the few, but to raise
  their own level, to improve their social and economic condition.</p>

  <p>As we said at the time, this social engineering proposed by the Gorbachev regime was
  recognized by the imperialist bourgeoisie almost from its inception as a step backward
  to capitalism. Margaret Thatcher was the first to hail Gorbachev with her statement: "I
  like him."</p>

  <p>It was a signal to all others that the time was ripe for all kinds of overtures to
  the Gorbachev administration. Praise and flattery poured upon him in an unending
  stream, and has only recently been moderated.</p>

  <p>The right, however, were all too eager to move faster in a capitalist direction. On
  the left was a conservative Party leadership with no program of its own which had voted
  for the Gorbachev reforms. It had given unanimous endorsement to the Gorbachev program
  to introduce private property, even though on a small scale, in industries on the
  periphery of the infrastructure of the USSR. This meant small doses of capitalist
  competition and free marketeering, freer rein to small business, partial
  decollectivization of farms, greater autonomy for the managerial elite, and the
  beginning of decentralization of the planned economy.</p>

  <h4>From nibbling to the whole bite</h4>

  <p>Yet, serious as the introduction of the bourgeois reforms was when they came into
  full swing in 1988, it still amounted to nibbling. It did not go to the heart of the
  matter: the privatization of the basic industries and the untrammeled restoration of
  private property.</p>

  <p>This is the essence of the so-called 500-day agreement between Gorbachev, the
  centrist, and Yeltsin, the thorough-going bourgeois restorationist.</p>

  <p>How could such a scheme possibly gather momentum in the land of the October
  Socialist Revolution?</p>

  <p>Gorbachev and his leading supporters could never have gone that far with his
  bourgeois reforms had he not had the freedom in foreign policy matters which he lacked
  as a centrist politician in domestic affairs.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze embarked on a wholly new foreign policy
  in relation to imperialism which all other Soviet leaders had scrupulously avoided.
  They linked overtures to the imperialist bourgeoisie with Gorbachev's domestic plan for
  bourgeois restructuring and glasnost. This was breaking new ground.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev administration abandoned what had been a scrupulous refusal to let the
  imperialist bourgeoisie in any way interfere, let alone have a hand in, the domestic
  affairs of the USSR. Slowly and gradually, he opened the door wider and wider to the
  imperialist bourgeoisie.</p>

  <h4>Importance of the Greenspan visit</h4>

  <p>Probably the most dramatic example of this was the invitation by the Soviet economic
  and banking establishment to Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the
  central bank of the U.S. As leader of the financial system of the imperialist
  bourgeoisie, he went to Moscow for secret consultations on how to restructure the
  banking system of the USSR and realign it with the imperialist financial structure by
  taking whatever economic or financial measures were necessary to make the ruble
  convertible with the leading currencies of imperialism &mdash; the dollar, yen and
  deutschmark.</p>

  <p>This development, so little written about in either press, completely exposed the
  real perspective of the Gorbachev administration. It envisaged the realignment of the
  Soviet banking system with the financial structure of the imperialist bourgeoisie,
  supposedly to help rehabilitate the USSR and to give a new impetus to the bourgeois
  economic development in the country.</p>

  <p>One would think that such a dramatic offer would be eagerly accepted by the leaders
  of the imperialist banks. Why didn't Greenspan grab it with both hands? The answer, as
  we must now acknowledge, was the weakness and the critical situation of the imperialist
  banks themselves. A realignment of the banking system and the currency of the USSR
  would still further debilitate the shaky imperialist financial system itself.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois reforms which the Gorbachev regime thought would take hold swiftly
  have proved to be a protracted process. Peaceful restoration of capitalism in the USSR,
  as imagined in the West, has met with the resistance of the masses. The bureaucracy
  (especially the economic planners) fear colliding with them if they speed up the
  process of bourgeois restoration. That is why, after five years of the reforms, they
  must talk of a 500-day plan.</p>

  <p>The chaos created in industry and in agriculture is the result of quiet sabotage by
  the bourgeois elements. It will not be long before this is fully understood by the
  masses.</p>

  <h4>Capitalist restoration? Not yet</h4>

  <p>One would think, as the bourgeois press intimates almost every day, that socialist
  planning and public ownership of property are all but gone in the USSR. Unfortunately
  for the bourgeoisie, this has not yet really happened.</p>

  <p>It is true that the process of dismantling socialist industry and abandoning
  socialist planning in favor of market relations has taken a heavy toll and continues to
  do so; but the thoroughgoing transformation the imperialists expected has not
  happened.</p>

  <p>It is not for the progressive movement anywhere to attempt a finished formulation of
  such a great historical phenomenon when it is still in the process of development.
  Furthermore, it is daily being affected by the entire global situation, especially by
  what is happening to the global capitalist economy, on which the bourgeois elements in
  the USSR are depending for significant assistance and cooperation.</p>

  <p>The imperialist system upon which they are counting is in the throes of the worst
  economic situation since pre-October 1929. One cannot but notice that the imperialists
  are not rushing to invest in the collapsed East European socialist countries, nor in
  the USSR.</p>

  <p>Even the Johnson and Johnson heiress, which was ready to invest $100 million in the
  privatization of the Gdansk shipyards, is now holding back. Not a day passes but one or
  another bourgeois economist presents a gloomy forecast of the economic situation.</p>

  <p>Last Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that a so-called shortage of capital
  is weakening the structure of the world capitalist system. But it's not a shortage of
  capital that is frightening the bourgeoisie; it is an accelerating flight of capital
  from the U.S.</p>

  <p>What does that signify? The precariousness of the capitalist system. The constant
  shifting of funds from one capital to another indicates nervousness over a potential
  economic collapse.</p>

  <p>The October 1987 crash was passed over as a mere aberration of the capitalist
  economic system. The collapse that might have followed was averted by an infusion of
  funds from the Federal Reserve Bank, the Bundesbank of Germany, and Japan. That created
  an inflationary current and a huge speculative wave that has now engulfed the
  subsidiaries, the so-called savings and loans banks.</p>

  <p>Is it really possible to pass off the failure of hundreds of banks as an ordinary
  phenomenon?</p>

  <p>Was it an ordinary phenomenon for the capitalist government to give free rein to the
  distribution of fictitious capital &mdash; junk bonds &mdash; and glut the financial
  markets with it?</p>

  <p>Or is it the beginning of a great crisis?</p>

  <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has just granted a license to J.P. Morgan
  &amp; Co. to sell and distribute stock. Congress prohibited such activity by the banks
  in 1933, following the so-called bank holiday declared by the Roosevelt administration
  when the banking system was on the verge of collapse.</p>

  <p>The National Association of Security Dealers has pointed out that this move violates
  an act of Congress, but the SEC has freed the Morgan bank from this restriction anyhow.
  It can be seen as a confession by the central bankers that this time they are not able
  to prime the pump as in 1987, and hope the market can do it. It is in this context that
  one must view the layoff of 5,000 Chase Manhattan employees, a bank controlled by one
  of the richest families in the world. It is a strong indication of the impending crisis
  in the U.S.</p>

  <p>For Soviet economists to believe that this system, the system of capitalist
  exploitation and oppression, is now in a position to invest its fortunes in
  rehabilitating the USSR so it will have a thriving capitalist economy is to indulge in
  one of the worst delusions possible.</p>

  <p>It is infinitely more realistic to anticipate that the workers in the USSR will be
  awakened to their real interests and stem the counterrevolutionary tide.</p>
