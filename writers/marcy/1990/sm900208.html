  <h1>Hand of CIA in USSR ethnic struggles</h1>

  <h2>The Matlock-Pell connection</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Feb. 8, 1990)</h5>

  <p>January 31 &mdash; A potentially disastrous development involving the Baltic
  republics of the USSR together with Azerbaijan and Armenia could pose a danger to the
  very integrity of the Soviet Union as a multinational state and lay the basis for its
  disintegration.</p>

  <p>A dispatch from Moscow to the New York Times of Jan. 30 makes this clear. Times
  correspondent Francis X. Clines writes:</p>

  <p>"A new sort of political initiative has emerged beyond the Kremlin's orbit with the
  resourceful Baltic separatist movements persuading their counterparts in the feuding
  southern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan to hold peace talks in the Latvian
  republic.</p>

  <p>"The talks, which are to begin on Thursday in Riga, the Latvian capital, are being
  treated by the three Baltic nationalist movements with all the care and protocol of a
  diplomatic initiative.</p>

  <p>"The peace gathering amounts to the Baltic republics' latest challenge to Moscow's
  central authority, an attempt to show that effective governance in the Soviet Union has
  shifted to decentralized populist politics capable of dealing with problems that have
  the Kremlin in crisis. Armenia and Azerbaijan accepted the offer as a means of dealing
  with their conflict beyond the purview of the Kremlin.</p>

  <p>"Notably absent from the conference, whose details were carefully explained in Riga
  today after an initial announcement on Sunday, will be the central government of
  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.''</p>

  <h4>What the press here leaves out</h4>

  <p>Such is the situation as seen from the imperialist side, which is obviously
  delighted with this development. Of course, an exceptionally significant element is
  left out, and not only in this dispatch. It is also played down in the USSR itself,
  where it is given, in our view, only perfunctory attention. That is the role of the
  U.S. in this struggle of the nationalities, both in the Baltic republics and in the
  South.</p>

  <p>To see the influence of the U.S., we should go back to the very beginning of the
  massive demonstrations in both Armenia and Azerbaijan. As soon as they took on a
  violent character, and scarcely before there were any mass exoduses from either
  republic, the U.S. government demonstrated that it had fully prepared for such
  contingencies. Within days of the eruption of violence, Washington already had in place
  reception centers for <strong>Armenian</strong> refugees in Italy and in the U.S.</p>

  <h4>Everything was ready</h4>

  <p>Even more significant was the speed with which visa applications for the refugees
  were processed and they were transported to their destinations. The personnel of the
  various refugee groupings and institutions which deal with these matters were
  astonished. It so sharply contrasted with U.S. policy on refugees from other countries.
  In particular, it was noted how indifferent and harsh the U.S. has been to those
  fleeing political persecution south of the U.S. border. Some, like the so-called boat
  people from Haiti, have been left to die rather than be allowed ashore.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the sharp contrast in the treatment of refugees was not brought to the
  attention of the American public. The protests of some Azerbaijani groups regarding the
  whole matter were not even discussed in the capitalist press. Be that as it may, it
  showed that the U.S. was effectively strengthening an axis with the Armenian bourgeois
  groupings, and was doing it virtually unnoticed, at least on the surface, by the USSR
  authorities.</p>

  <h4>Aftermath of the earthquake</h4>

  <p>Another aspect was the devastating earthquake in Armenia. This catastrophe aroused
  the sympathy of the whole world. Under such circumstances, anyone willing to help was
  of course welcomed. It is to be noted, however, that generally when earthquakes or
  natural disasters take place, even those governments most closely allied with or
  friendly to the imperialist powers become suspicious when they see an excessive number
  of foreigners suddenly deluge the country, although apparently it is all done for good
  and humanitarian reasons.</p>

  <p>Such was the case, for instance, when floods hit Bangladesh, and again when the
  great earthquake took place in Mexico. The Mexican government felt obliged from the
  very beginning to let the U.S. government know just what was required and what was not.
  In a number of African countries where famine has followed drought, there has been the
  same caution &mdash; that their vulnerability would be taken advantage of by the
  predatory imperialists in the name of generosity and aid.</p>

  <p>When the catastrophe took place in Armenia, the Soviet government virtually invited
  the U.S. to send any and all material and other aid. This was contrary to earlier
  Soviet practice, which had been completely restrictive and indeed secretive about any
  kind of natural or other disaster.</p>

  <p>The capitalist press widely applauded the move as a gesture of openness and
  glasnost. But the CIA is the CIA. It took every opportunity to widen its penetration of
  the area. Thus this openness, to the applause of the capitalist press, led to a deep
  penetration by the U.S. It was able to solicit leading figures and begin to win over
  whatever friendly sources the central government had in Armenia. From the point of view
  of the different class systems, it's equivalent to inviting the enemy into your home
  and giving him unrestricted access.</p>

  <p>One must also remember that any country which undergoes such a devastating
  experience inevitably exposes all the vulnerabilities of a political, social or
  environmental character which most countries would rather keep to themselves. That's
  why China would not allow any help from the U.S. when it experienced the great
  earthquake of 1976. Even imperialist countries have innumerable restrictions on
  assistance from foreign governments during times of disaster, since a great deal is
  revealed in times of stress and no one wants to be put in an exposed position.</p>

  <p>This is what has to be kept in mind as we examine what happened next.</p>

  <h4>U.S. ambassador tours area</h4>

  <p>When in July 1989 the strife between Armenia and Azerbaijan took on an especially
  violent character, U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock decided to take a tour of the area
  right in the midst of the conflict. How the Soviet authorities could permit an
  accredited ambassador to visit an area where civil strife was occurring is a
  mystery.</p>

  <p>Not so long ago a massive rebellion took place in Liberty City, a Black community in
  Miami. Would the U.S. have allowed the Soviet Ambassador to tour the area? They even
  prohibited local reporters!</p>

  <p>Finally, the USSR had to lodge a complaint &mdash; not because Matlock had toured
  the area (they had allowed that) but because an axis had been revealed between Matlock
  and perhaps the most important figure in the U.S. Congress regarding the struggle
  there. He is none other than the low-profile Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode
  Island and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Pell is the essential
  figure in pushing pro-Armenian resolutions in the Senate and is apparently in close
  contact with U.S. Ambassador Matlock. All this has the blessings of the Bush
  administration.</p>

  <h4>Complaint by Soviet Foreign Ministry</h4>

  <p>That this network could function so openly forced the Soviet Foreign Ministry to
  finally make a complaint and have it widely publicized. But this happened only on Nov.
  19, 1989, and was reported in the New York Times the next day. It complained that a
  second pro-Armenian resolution had been passed by the Senate Foreign Relations
  Committee, and it noted that this time it followed closely on the heels of Ambassador
  Matlock's tour of the area and was evidently part of a deliberate policy. The ministry
  said that such conduct ``can provoke destabilization and bring new suffering'' to the
  peoples concerned.</p>

  <p>The USSR complained that the resolution came at a delicate moment in the relations
  between Armenia and Azerbaijan and hinted that it was provocative. However, all of
  this, which shows the hand of U.S. imperialism in the southern region, was given scant
  notice in the USSR. Pravda merely reported the foreign ministry's complaint. There was
  no effort to really come to grips with the problem of U.S. intervention in what they
  themselves call "the internal affairs of the USSR.''</p>

  <p>There are many ways the USSR could highlight the problem and make the world aware of
  its significance. One would be to introduce a resolution in the Soviet Parliament. By
  way of amendment, they could also introduce a supplementary amendment supporting
  independence for Puerto Rico, which seems to have long been forgotten. But that would
  mean breaking up the agreements of accommodation with the U.S.</p>

  <p>Under the Stalin regime, of course, just about all and any opposition, whether from
  the left or the right, was indiscriminately branded pro-imperialist. Now, however,
  there is an accommodating and even ingratiating position in relation to U.S.
  imperialism. Is it part of an overall agreement?</p>

  <h4>U.S. influence in Baltics</h4>

  <p>It is scarcely necessary to go over the influence of Western imperialism in the
  Baltic republics. It is not for nothing that the U.S. has kept open legations supposed
  to represent Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia when virtually the rest of the world paid no
  attention whatever to them. Then the State Department every year sponsored an annual
  Captive Nations Week. No, this doesn't mean the nations held captive by the U.S., like
  the Native people of this country, Puerto Rico, Samoa, and the Hawaiians. It refers to
  the Baltic peoples. Over the years, even though their demonstrations might have drawn
  only a few hundred people, they were given wide publicity.</p>

  <p>It is against this background that one has to view the invitation to mediate the
  Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict by the so-called popular fronts of Estonia, Latvia and
  Lithuania. Not only are these groups pro-imperialist, but some are extreme right-wing,
  even pro-Nazi bourgeois elements. How can they suddenly become the mediators for the
  southern republics, inviting them to Riga for a "peace conference'' to demonstrate
  their intentions of separating from the USSR?</p>

  <p>The Baltic republics are among the most developed industrially in the USSR, and the
  bourgeois elements there have never shown anything but contempt for the underdeveloped
  southern republics. Anyone with the slightest knowledge of the historical background of
  these so-called popular fronts is immediately suspicious of this fraudulent mediation
  effort. What is it but a threadbare trick set up by the CIA to establish some coalition
  of the Soviet nationalities in order to detach them from the USSR?</p>

  <p>No honest representative of the nationalities involved would ever think of forming
  such a coalition on their own! But such is now the situation. As the Times says, it
  poses a challenge to the central government.</p>

  <p>The issue here has to be clearly understood.</p>

  <h4>Right of self-determination</h4>

  <p>Every nationality in the USSR under the Constitution (even as amended) has the right
  of self-determination, up to and including secession. And even if the Constitution were
  changed, this is the Leninist concept of the right to self-determination, which we
  firmly and unequivocally support.</p>

  <p>But it is something absolutely different to allow the U.S., the fundamental class
  enemy of the USSR and of all the oppressed people of the world, to firmly implant
  itself in the Baltic republics (an extremely sensitive area from the point of view of
  the security and defense of the USSR), and get another foothold in the South.</p>

  <p>What independent country would allow that? Wouldn't its obligation be to show what
  the imperialists have been doing there on virtually a day-to-day basis?</p>

  <h4>Once more, the economic reforms</h4>

  <p>It is true, of course, that Gorbachev's economic reforms have not only accentuated
  the strife but in fact have deliberately set the nationalities against each other. They
  have undercut the economic security of the less developed areas in particular by
  granting individual enterprises so-called independence. This decentralization turns out
  to be a way to unload economic problems on them.</p>

  <p>Instead of planning more efficiently than their predecessors, instead of living up
  to their promises of resolving the problems that the previous regimes had ignored, they
  seem to be completely baffled and unprepared; all they can do is castigate the previous
  administrations. (As one Soviet coal miner is reported to have said, "It is easy to
  pull the tail of a dead lion.")</p>

  <p>Gorbachev himself seemed completely perplexed when he went to Armenia after the
  disaster and tried in his usual manner to talk to the people. Instead of asking
  questions about the earthquake, they bombarded him with questions of a political
  character regarding alleged atrocities by Azerbaijan and Armenia's demand for the
  annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

  <p>In recent speeches both President Gorbachev and Politburo member V.A. Medvedev have
  tried to appeal to Party members to reject a split along nationalist lines. But nowhere
  do they mention the hostile hand of U.S. imperialism.</p>

  <p>Nor is there any attempt to reach out to the workers and speak in the name of
  <strong>proletarian internationalism</strong> as against a bourgeois popular front.
  Nowhere do they speak to the workers of Latvia, for instance, about their glorious
  history in the struggle to defend Petrograd from the White Guards after the Revolution.
  Nor do they remind the workers of who freed them from Nazi control, of the lives lost
  by the Red Army and the Partisans.</p>

  <p>Why not speak to the workers, instead of giving out a mishmash of bourgeois
  eclecticism? Any head of a bourgeois multinational state could say the same things that
  Gorbachev is now saying, with minor changes. Is brute force the only alternative?</p>
