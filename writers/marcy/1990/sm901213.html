  <h1>The reemergence of workers' control in the USSR</h1>

  <h2>A response to pressure from below</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Dec. 13, 1990)</h5>

  <p>There are now many stories appearing in the capitalist press about the growing food
  crisis in the Soviet Union. But there is a difference from such reports in previous
  years. It is the ruling class here that is showing signs of embarrassment over the
  developments rather than those who have been consistent advocates of socialism and a
  planned economy.</p>

  <p>The embarrassment arises from the fact that the capitalist ruling class has been the
  chief sponsor of the Gorbachev free market capitalist experiments in the hope that they
  would soon result in the establishment of a full-scale capitalist system. It is true
  that the Gorbachev regime has been pushing experiments which have resulted not merely
  in dismantling parts of the socialist economy but also in destabilizing practically all
  phases of the economic system of the USSR.</p>

  <p>It has now reached the point where the economy is being vandalized. The familiar
  capitalist phenomenon of plant closings, speculation, hoarding and outright theft of
  socialist property has become common. Such characteristics of the capitalist system are
  nowhere more prevalent than in the food and consumer goods industries.</p>

  <p>It is to be remembered that at the last party conference in 1988 Gorbachev
  characterized the food situation in the country as being not only critical but acute.
  Now it has so deteriorated that food is actually being imported from Germany, some in
  the form of charitable donations. The irony is that gratuitous food shipments from
  Germany as well as some from the U.S. are being hurried, not for humanitarian reasons,
  but, according to the New York Times (Dec. 5), to save Gorbachev.</p>

  <p>Such is the situation, a truly desperate one for the Soviet leader who was hailed by
  all the capitalist countries as nothing less than the hero who would transform the USSR
  into a thriving "capitalist paradise."</p>

  <p>Faced with today's desperate situation, the Gorbachev regime has had to resort to an
  entirely unexpected stratagem to fight the growing food crisis. Indeed it is a surprise
  that he issued a decree on Dec. 1 that calls for nothing less than the institution of a
  form of workers' control over the distribution of food and consumer goods. It is to go
  into effect 10 days after its publication.</p>

  <p>The very phrase workers' control has genuine revolutionary implications. It brings
  to mind the workers' control measures that the Leninist government instituted in the
  days immediately following the October Revolution in 1917. What it means is that
  Gorbachev, in his half-hearted struggle against the thoroughgoing restorationist
  bourgeois elements in the USSR, feels so much endangered by the chaos, confusion and
  havoc brought on the heads of the population that he is calling upon the workers to
  come to his aid (at least in the food and consumer goods industries) and stop the
  sabotage by the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>He is calling upon the only class in the USSR which has the inherent power to roll
  back the capitalist offensive which he himself started with his ill-starred economic
  experiments.</p>

  <h4>Workers' committees given extensive powers</h4>

  <p>The full text of the decree has not been made available here, but what can be
  learned from the press reports in this country is that the workers' committees are to
  be elected all over the country directly in the workplaces, plants and offices. Under
  the decree, the workers' committees have been granted the authority to shut down guilty
  enterprises where they find theft, diversion of resources, speculation and other
  criminal activity. They also have the authority to discharge personnel involved in the
  illegal actions and can, under the decree, institute criminal proceedings. They can not
  only inspect any and all enterprises, they'll have the right to look at the books, make
  the necessary investigations and, where they find offenses, can oust the management of
  the enterprise.</p>

  <p>It's a truly sweeping measure of authority granted to the workers in the struggle
  against the food profiteers and saboteurs and speculators, the hoarders and outright
  thieves.</p>

  <p>Of course, it's only a decree, one of many by the Gorbachev administration. Its
  success depends upon whether the workers' committees get the cooperation of Gorbachev's
  governing group in trying to solve the food crisis. It is not possible to solve the
  food distribution problem without a coherent plan of reinstituting a planned economy to
  salvage it from the vandalism and outright destructive methods of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>To be effective, the workers' committees must bear the characteristics of true
  workers' control as instituted in the days immediately following the October
  Revolution. Gorbachev would like nothing better at this particular moment of widespread
  discontent than to take on the mantle of Lenin and his measures for workers'
  control.</p>

  <h4>In 1917, all industry subject to workers' control</h4>

  <p>It should be recalled that the draft regulations on workers' control issued under
  the Leninist regime were not confined to the distribution of food and vital consumer
  products. They covered the production of essentially all products made in the new
  workers' state.</p>

  <p>A draft of the initial regulations defines workers' control as follows: "Workers'
  control over the production, storage, purchase and sale of all products and raw
  materials shall be introduced in all industrial, commercial, banking, agricultural and
  other enterprises ...</p>

  <p>"Workers' control shall be exercised by all the workers and office employees of an
  enterprise, either directly, if the enterprise is small enough to permit it, or through
  their elected representatives, who shall be elected <em>immediately</em> at general
  meetings, at which minutes of the election shall be taken. ... The decisions of the
  elected representatives of the workers and office employees are binding upon the owners
  of enterprises. ... " [which in the Soviet Union today would mean the managers &mdash;
  S.M.] (<em>Lenin's Collected Works</em>, Vol. 26, page 264).</p>

  <p>We thus see that workers' control under the Leninist regime covered all phases of
  production as well as distribution.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev has resorted to legalizing the form of workers' control as the only way to
  counter the sabotage of the bourgeois elements in the USSR.</p>

  <h4>Workers' control in capitalist countries ...</h4>

  <p>Workers' control must be understood as a transitional stage of development. In
  capitalist society workers' control is a revolutionary step forward toward seizure of
  the plants and industry generally, toward operating them in accordance with the will
  and interests of the working class.</p>

  <p>Workers' control in capitalist society is the phase in the revolutionary struggle
  that is followed by the dispossession of the former owners of the plants and industry.
  That is, the expropriation of the bourgeoisie takes place, followed by a declaration
  that all political power over industry is now in the hands of the working class. It is
  the consummation of the workers' state and is generally followed by a whole series of
  legislative acts setting out the rights and obligation of the workers in the
  construction of socialism.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that to some extent workers' control was an issue raised
  during the Great Depression in the 1930s. It was especially raised in France and Spain
  during the crisis period of capitalist society when the Popular Front was at the helm.
  Unfortunately it did not go much further at the time due to the unwillingness of the
  leadership of the Communist and Socialist parties to carry workers' control to its
  ultimate conclusion &mdash; the expropriation of the bourgeoisie and the establishment
  of workers' states.</p>

  <h4>... and as part of building socialism</h4>

  <p>Workers' control in the period of 1917 was an absolutely necessary phase in order to
  set the stage for the seizure of plants and equipment to be followed by the complete
  expropriation of the bourgeoisie. Having done that, the role of workers' control
  underwent an evolution in the direction of building socialism. As a precondition, that
  required beginning a planned economic system.</p>

  <p>And that meant centralizing industry in the hands of the workers' government &mdash;
  accompanied by democratic procedures both in running the plants as well as
  participation in central planning for the new workers' state.</p>

  <p>Today, however, we are dealing with a situation in which workers' control has
  virtually disappeared, its authority having been usurped by the managerial grouping,
  which has the exclusive authority to manage production and to regulate almost all
  phases of social production in the USSR. Of course, this could only have happened
  because the party itself has not only been infiltrated but undergone a bourgeois
  degeneration resulting from the acquisition of special material privileges which eroded
  its revolutionary proletarian standing with the workers and peasants.</p>

  <p>True, the trade unions commanded a strong influence on the workers. The
  constitution, as it was written before the Gorbachev grouping took over and changed it,
  theoretically accorded the unions veto power over planning by virtue of the workers'
  standing as the pillar of socialist society. So that legally the unions had a great
  deal of power, but there is no evidence that they ever actually exercised it
  independently. In truth, they were shunted aside, relegated to concerning themselves
  only with social insurance, job safety and other matters. In reality they did not use
  their great legal authority.</p>

  <p>It is only lately that there has been a reawakening of the lethargic trade union
  apparatus. And that came under the impact of the mineworkers' strike of 1989 and its
  repercussions throughout the country. The relationship between the workers' committees
  and the trade unions is of key significance at the present moment.</p>

  <p>No segment of Soviet society can be relied upon to reverse this situation except the
  working class. Only the working class can reverse an economic catastrophe the Gorbachev
  administration has brought about by cultivating and strengthening the bourgeois
  elements all over Soviet society.</p>

  <p>There are significant problems that have yet to be revealed, as to how the Soviet
  workers' control committees can succeed in their mission without the cooperation of
  other sectors of the civilian population in the USSR. To be successful a committee must
  not only be truly representative of the workers but must have the cooperation of all
  industrial and transport workers as the next step.</p>

  <p>Workers' control cannot be fully successful in one industry alone because of the
  integrated character of the Soviet planned economy. Despite erosion and sabotage, the
  socialist sector is still an enormous part of the Soviet economy.</p>

  <h4>Evidence of dual power in USSR</h4>

  <p>The workers' committees must have a central organ and an elected leadership that is
  responsible to the committees, free from the Gorbachev administrators of the Soviet
  state. It must be understood that the emergence of workers' control is a symptom of the
  existence of dual power in the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>The working class has a latent power that is in sharp opposition to the new
  bourgeoisie, which controls a substantial part of the state apparatus. It is in many
  ways the kind of dual power that arises in any society where class antagonisms have
  reached the boiling point and cannot be reconciled because of the divergent,
  contrasting perspectives of each class.</p>

  <p>One points in the direction of bourgeois restoration; the other objectively seeks to
  reorient society back to an improved, even more revolutionary workers' state. The
  former is the tendency of stagnation and deterioration growing out of the desire to
  dismantle, destabilize and vandalize the workers' state.</p>

  <p>A quick fix by the Gorbachev grouping to bring about a capitalist restoration is out
  of the question. They have already spent more than five years trying to do it. Both
  sides have become impatient while Gorbachev is promising an acceptable solution to
  both. That explains why the bourgeois parliament surrendered so much of its authority
  in granting Gorbachev the power to issue decrees covering nearly every phase of Soviet
  society.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev's attempt to balance one class against another has only resulted in
  further deterioration of the economy. But it would be erroneous to assume from his
  shift in favor of a form of workers' control that he is moving away from the
  bourgeoisie altogether. That is not true in light of his centrist politics.</p>

  <p>The very day after he introduced the workers' committees, Gorbachev proposed that
  the state release 12 million acres of land for private farming, one of the very
  measures responsible for the food crisis in the first place. Thus he continues to
  balance the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>But like all such Bonapartist regimes which can only maintain themselves on the
  basis of an equilibrium between the two antagonistic classes in society, such a
  balancing act can only be of the most temporary character and is sure to give way when
  one or the other of the two antagonistic classes seizes the initiative and establishes
  its own rule.</p>

  <h4>Proof that capitalism hasn't triumphed</h4>

  <p>The reemergence of workers' control is proof positive that not everything in the
  USSR has been lost to capitalism. The existence of dual power shows that the workers
  still have the opportunity to reverse the situation and even reach new heights in
  socialist construction.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev and his grouping are at a fork in the road. A balancing act cannot long
  suffice. Consider the view of Ilya V. Kholmogortsev, 81, reported in the New York Times
  Dec. 5. "[Kholmogortsev] offered this advice on how to solve the food problem: `Replace
  the government. Take no foreign loans. Bring to account all those who have stolen. Take
  away their millions and kill them.' ...</p>

  <p>"Much of the anger is focused on Mr. Gorbachev and his policies. `Gorbachev is to
  blame for everything,' said Valentina Popova. ... `We had everything under Brezhnev.
  Such perestroika is not needed if I cannot buy sugar.' "</p>

  <p>Gorbachev will either be pushed over completely to the right &mdash; and in the
  event the bourgeois restorationists win they will cast him aside. Likewise, if the
  workers are victorious they will certainly have no need for him or his likes at
  all.</p>
