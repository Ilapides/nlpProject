  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: The new property law in the USSR (April 12,
  1990)</title>

  <h1>The new property law in the USSR</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 12, 1990)</h5>

  <p>President Mikhail Gorbachev, in his speech to the opening of the Third Session of
  the USSR Supreme Soviet (condensed text published in Izvestia, Feb. 14), said the
  situation in the USSR today is characterized by "a colossal politicization of our
  society."</p>

  <p>This term "politicization," as he and his colleagues should know, is altogether
  inadequate to describe this critical period. Politicization, the mass of the people
  becoming more politically aware or active, in itself could mean a great advance. But
  that's not what's involved. The term he should have used is polarization.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev policies lead to polarization</h4>

  <p>Gorbachev had just told the deputies, "We all feel keenly the tragic turn of events
  in the southern part of the country, events that have led to people's deaths and mass
  expulsions from their home areas." Yes, death, destruction, expulsion, continuing
  growth of national animosities and the use of troops to quell rebellions. Hasn't this
  led to a polarization between the southern republics and the central government that
  threatens the dismemberment of the USSR?</p>

  <p>But Gorbachev has an explanation. "For a long time, everything was done to find a
  political solution to the difficult questions that had arisen." Really? Everything was
  done to find a political solution?</p>

  <p>Let us see how it all started.</p>

  <p>The first significant rebellion came in December 1986 after the replacement of the
  leader of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, Dinmukhamed A. Kunayev, with an ethnic
  Russian. That was a political solution?</p>

  <p>The chauvinism of the center awakened nationalist sentiment, with accompanying
  violence. The imperialist bourgeoisie played this in low key then, out of solicitude
  for the new "imaginative, innovative" Soviet leader.</p>

  <p>So the issue was laid to rest. But the sparks from it soon made themselves felt in
  the revival of an old inter-ethnic controversy between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the
  enclave of Nagorno-Karabach. Whatever one may say about the predecessors of Gorbachev,
  under their tenure this dispute never reached the level of death, destruction and
  violence which we have all witnessed since the advent of the new reformers in
  Moscow.</p>

  <p>So how was this very sensitive issue that so deeply concerns the integrity of the
  USSR dealt with? It was shoved from pillar to post in forums where Gorbachev sermonized
  on the virtues of taking an internationalist view, spending most of his time scolding
  the Armenian and Azeri delegations while postponing any specific recommendations until
  ... the next meeting.</p>

  <p>It finally reached the 19th All-Union Party Conference in June 1988. This, as anyone
  can see now, was staged with the intention of demonstrating to the predatory Western
  imperialist powers that the USSR was moving towards democratic procedures. The
  restructuring of the economy would open wide the doors to private initiatives and there
  would be a multiplicity of views and organizations, all to the greater glory of
  establishing a bourgeois parliament, Western style.</p>

  <p>The capitalist press loved it. They showered praise and flattery on Gorbachev and
  his colleagues. But what had happened to the Azeri and Armenian delegations?</p>

  <h4>Armenia-Azerbaijan struggle ignored</h4>

  <p>They were left out in the cold, treated as orphans. The territorial dispute remained
  unresolved. No wonder that soon after the delegations went home, violence and hatred
  exploded of the type that could only envenom their relationships, leaving them without
  even the modicum of a political solution within the framework of the USSR.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev tells us that it then became necessary to act militarily. "But when there
  was nothing else to be done to prevent the deaths of thousands of people, the Presidium
  of the Supreme Soviet took emergency measures. The situation there is now under
  control, if one may put it that way [Was this meant to be ironic? &mdash; S.M.], but
  tension remains."</p>

  <p>There were two problems that needed solution: the underdevelopment of the southern
  republics, and their relation to the central government.</p>

  <p>Great beginnings in development were made under the Leninist government, not only in
  economics but in culture, including literature and art. Not that they were able to wipe
  out the long-standing sharp divergence between the economic and cultural level of the
  southern republics and the center, but great strides were made in proletarian
  solidarity. Foreign accounts about conditions in the south, from friend and foe,
  wondered at the achievements. And while many were rightfully skeptical, all were aware
  that there was peace, stability and inter-ethnic amity. (For sources, see <em>The
  Siberians</em> by Farley Mowat and <em>Soviet but not Russian</em> by William
  Mandel.)</p>

  <p>Gorbachev took office over 70 years after the Bolshevik Revolution, after stupendous
  progress had been made in science and technology &mdash; the keys in the struggle
  against underdevelopment. How can anyone overlook the significance of the Soviet
  Union's standing in space technology, nuclear energy, electronics, and the many related
  sciences which occasioned the imperialists to call it a superpower?</p>

  <h4>What they said then</h4>

  <p>When Gorbachev first announced his restructuring plans, it was assumed that they
  meant a new rationalization of industry, a further development of the
  scientific-technological revolution, more rapid mechanization, all of which would
  impart a rapid rise to the general social development of the southern republics.</p>

  <p>Hearing the early speeches of this new bourgeois cabal of lawyers, technocrats and
  bourgeois politicians, no one would know that their eyes were cast in the direction of
  placating and accommodating the West rather than on raising the material and cultural
  level where it was needed first and foremost, in the southern republics.</p>

  <p>Modernizing industry need not encompass worker layoffs, closing of factories,
  introduction of work norms which divide the workers, and above all, disruption of
  socialist production relationships which lie at the core of the new social system.</p>

  <p>The new polarization of Soviet society, taking on the form of a struggle between the
  nationalities and the center, is only a reflection of the economic restructuring which
  is divisive, corrosive and thoroughly defeatist of socialist solidarity.</p>

  <h4>Economics determines politics</h4>

  <p>The experience of the last 140 years confirms what Marx and Engels wrote in the
  <em>Communist Manifesto,</em> that economics determines politics. You cannot champion
  steps toward bourgeois restoration without unleashing political forces that tend to
  tear the Soviet Union apart.</p>

  <p>Nothing so much points this up as the latest legislative initiative emanating from
  the Gorbachev administration. It is the draft law on property in the USSR, which has
  consumed the attention of the entire Supreme Soviet. (Condensed text of the
  proceedings, taken from Izvestia, is in The Current Digest of the Soviet Press, March
  21, 1990.)</p>

  <p>This law is said to be necessary to redefine property. Why does it need
  redefinition? At least 99% of the Soviet people are now literate. Who does not know the
  meaning of the three forms of ownership in the USSR? There is state ownership,
  collective farm ownership, and the private property of individuals, i.e., property
  which is the product of one's own labor.</p>

  <p>The accumulation of property from one's own labor has never been prohibited in the
  Soviet Union. On the contrary, the aim of advancing from the lower stage of socialism,
  the workers' state, to a higher form means a greater abundance and accumulation of
  private things, consumer items, the product of the labor of the people. Certainly, this
  doesn't need any great technical elaboration by the new legal camarilla in the USSR.
  It's understandable on the basis of experience.</p>

  <p>Besides that, Marx and Engels in the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> were very alert to
  the lies of the bourgeoisie, who said the communists wanted to abolish all property.
  No, they said, it is not all property we wish to abolish. "The distinguishing feature
  of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois
  property ... the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and
  appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the
  many by the few."</p>

  <p>The question of property didn't need great elaboration during the period before the
  Bolshevik Revolution, when social democracy was in its heyday, nor after the
  revolution. So what needs to be so fervently discussed today?</p>

  <p>It is to sneak in the legalization of private ownership and the buying and selling
  of the means of production. This is what really lies behind the barrage of speeches,
  which are calculated to cloud rather than clarify the meaning of the new law.</p>

  <h4>Struggle over private property law</h4>

  <p>The discussion in the Supreme Soviet was characterized by fear of using the word
  private property. A report in Izvestia of Feb. 16 noted that "the following leitmotifs
  were sounded: `Private property is necessary, we mustn't be afraid of terminology.'"
  That's the voice of the outspoken, brutally frank bourgeois.</p>

  <p>But this is countered by some who are altogether fearful of the consequences of
  tampering with the old concepts of bourgeois property vs. the socialist ownership of
  the means of production. "Any allusion to private property in the law is dangerous,
  because this will lead to the working people's enslavement by new exploiters," said one
  deputy. That could scarcely be made plainer. Unfortunately, we do not know who said it
  and how many approved the position as stated.</p>

  <p>Izvestia reported that the draft merely refers to "residential buildings,
  apartments, dachas, garden buildings, plantings on plots of ground, means of
  transportation, cash, stocks and other securities, and household and personal items as
  this form of property. As for means of production, it names those that are necessary to
  engaging in peasant or auxiliary farming, the growing of orchards and vegetable
  gardens, and individual and other enterprise."</p>

  <p>Not much to worry about, one would say. Moreover, the preamble states: "Socialist
  property serves the purpose of preventing the exploitation of man by man."</p>

  <p>However, some see it as an opening wedge to go much further. For instance, Deputy
  V.P. Nosov said, "Let's assume that we nullify the gains of October, betray the blood
  of our fathers and grandfathers, allow mother earth to be bought and sold, and allow
  private property. Who will buy the land? Those who acquired money in ways other than
  the use of their toil-hardened hands, the wheeler-dealers of the `shadow economy,' or,
  to put it simply, thieves. We peasants will work for them as hired hands."</p>

  <p>However, the Gorbachev administration has encountered great difficulty putting its
  restructuring ideas across through such laws as those converting collective agriculture
  into leaseholds with a semi-private character, or measures to dismantle state farms.
  The fear of the peasants and rural workers puts pressure on the lower echelons of the
  government and the bureaucracy, so that to this day, while the collective farm system
  has been undermined and many of the state farms dismantled, a great deal still needs to
  be done in order to liquidate them into private property. This has not happened, and is
  not likely to without encountering a life-and-death struggle from below.</p>

  <p>By introducing the law on property, the Gorbachev grouping has opened the door wide
  to the most sensitive and critical issue facing the USSR. In fact, the most bourgeois,
  right-wing of the reformers, Leonid I. Abalkin, chairman of the commission on the law
  and deputy head of the government, said that the further course of political and
  economic reform in the country and the fate of the people would depend in large part on
  the wording of this law.</p>

  <p>This is a bit of hyperbole. The fate of the people does not depend on the bourgeois
  restorationist reforms. The people will survive, regardless.</p>

  <h4>Not there yet, but heading toward capitalism</h4>

  <p>As we said earlier, the laws in and of themselves do not as yet mean the rapid
  dismantling of socialized industry. But they do clarify the direction taken by the
  governing group of the USSR. Some are in favor of a faster, some a slower pace, but all
  are moving along the downward course to capitalist restoration.</p>

  <p>But it is by no means an accomplished fact as yet, and this is what has to be kept
  in mind when it comes to the capitalist press, which has been so eager to push further
  and faster lest something unforeseen and thoroughly revolutionary, from a working-class
  point of view, takes place which tumbles the bourgeois governing camarilla in the USSR
  out of power.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Sunday, April 1 New York Times, News of the Week in Review
  section, carries the banner headline: "After Communism: Gorbachev, at a Dizzying
  Height, Prepares to Kick away the Ladder." An accompanying blurb says: "The party is
  now supposed to drop dead. It will be a dangerous few months."</p>

  <p>The object of this and similar articles in the bourgeois press is to convey the
  impression that it is all over in the USSR, that bourgeois restoration is all but
  accomplished and that it is only a question of how quickly Gorbachev and his
  colleagues, with one foot in the party apparatus and the other in the new bourgeoisie,
  will ditch the party, allowing it to disintegrate into a variety of conflicting
  neobourgeois tendencies with no progressive, left-wing, communist opposition.</p>

  <p>But we have seen funeral rites administered by the bourgeoisie to the workers' state
  over many decades, beginning with the Bolshevik Revolution itself. With every turn in a
  regressive direction, forces have always surfaced to check it.</p>

  <h4>Strength of workers' state</h4>

  <p>The workers' state has grown and developed, notwithstanding deterioration and
  deformation in its apparatus, and despite the negative, often acutely repressive
  tendencies arising from the legacy of backwardness under czarism, capitalist
  encirclement, and imperialist intervention over a period of decades costing millions of
  lives and untold destruction.</p>

  <p>Unquestionably, the most severe and determined pro-capitalist restorationist group
  is now wielding power in the USSR. But it will take a lot more than the will of this
  narrow, bourgeois sector to overwhelm the working class, the peasantry, and the
  progressive and revolutionary intelligentsia.</p>

  <p>Five years ago, when the reforms started, the Soviet public and the world
  working-class community were totally unaware of what this grouping was all about. The
  understanding was that perestroika was going to accelerate industrialization, bring new
  ideas and innovation, expand science and industry, raise the material and cultural
  level of the masses. They would be doing things differently, democratically, so they
  said, but the overall objective was to turn the huge scientific-technological apparatus
  around so as to make it more productive. As such it met with great enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>But as time went on it became clearer that what this grouping had in mind was a
  fundamental change in property relations, that is, to scuttle the socialist relations
  of production and introduce bourgeois relations of production. Only after this is
  completed and made "irreversible," they now say, will there be progress in material
  wellbeing and living standards.</p>

  <p>The programmatic documents at first said nothing about changing the relations of
  ownership, nothing about a free market, nothing about changing the entire price
  structure. (A fundamental upward revision of the price structure of basic commodities,
  as has been proposed, would amount to nothing less than a social counterrevolution, so
  deep would be the cut in living standards. No wonder Gorbachev and his group are
  fearful of putting it across, and therefore are resorting to piecemeal measures which
  aggravate rather than alleviate the economic situation.)</p>

  <p>None of this was understood when Gorbachev took over as General Secretary of the
  Party. Had their real program been explicitly submitted to a popular referendum, this
  grouping wouldn't have lasted 24 hours. As matters stand, they have radically changed
  not only the leadership but the social composition of the party itself. Now they are
  calling a Congress of the party in July to confirm what has already been done, without
  having solved a single economic and political problem facing the masses.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev has polarized society not only between the central government and the
  nationalities, but between the proletariat and the new bourgeoisie. Notwithstanding all
  the talk about bureaucracy, authoritarianism, etc., the regime that now holds the reins
  of power is more authoritarian, more bureaucratic than its predecessors.</p>

  <p>Has the government told the masses how many workers have been dislodged from
  industry by the reforms? What real income the workers get in the light of price
  changes? Has the government divulged the results of their five years of tinkering with
  collective farming, with the aim of liquidating it? Or their fruitless forays in light
  industry and consumer goods?</p>

  <h4>Disastrous political results</h4>

  <p>Perhaps all this has brought political advantages? But look at the sorry spectacle
  of the Gorbachev policy toward the Baltic states. The first experiment in bourgeois
  reforms, it was virtually in the imperialist camp before the Gorbachev administration
  finally got down to considering what measures should be taken to retain the Baltic
  republics as integral parts of the Soviet state.</p>

  <p>What's their solution? Not a return to proletarian solidarity, not addressing
  themselves to the workers to revive the revolutionary proletarian history of the Baltic
  states. No, they have reduced them to a small chip in the bargaining with U.S.
  imperialism. How in the world could this influence progressive, let alone communist,
  workers?</p>

  <p>How did Lenin approach the national question? The party directed itself to the
  workers as a class whose liberation lifts all elements of society, including the
  bourgeoisie, from oppression and exploitation. That is the sense in which we call it a
  national question. The party promotes freedom, sovereignty and independence in that
  sense.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev approach, especially in the Baltic states where reaction is strong, is
  directed to the bourgeois elements as the key to resolving the problem. He abandons the
  class question, going so far as to never even mention the existence of the workers or
  the peasants as such.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois press, in writing about the situation in the USSR, is not candid when
  it reports on the magnificent struggle of the coal miners last summer, or the 700,000
  workers in the central Siberian oilfields whose demands for better pay and living
  conditions have received little attention from the government, or the threatened strike
  by railroad workers. The bourgeois press doesn't take into account the revolutionary
  potentialities of the working class.</p>

  <p>The workers are at present still at the stage of economism, concerning themselves
  with the narrow, day-to-day struggles for survival. They have not yet addressed the
  larger classwide, life-and-death questions. Nor has any genuine, authoritative
  representative of the proletariat arrived on the scene at this date.</p>

  <p>It's the polarization of these workers against the bourgeoisie which constitutes the
  essence of the contradiction in Soviet society. It will do no good to bring up cookbook
  panaceas from the old days of pre-Leninism, or pre-Marxism, in order to solve today's
  problems in the USSR. The many millions of proletarians in the Soviet Union will regain
  their stature without them.</p>

  <p>The Soviet Union over seven decades has developed a strong centralized economy. The
  accumulation of false policies and the growth of a privileged sector have hindered
  further development, but this should not be the occasion for scuttling the socialist
  sector of the economy.</p>

  <p>The enormous development of world science and technology shows more and more the
  need for centralization of the productive forces. The world economy is becoming more
  and more integrated. If the working class and the oppressed nations do not take hold of
  the means of production, do not work out a centralized economy on a thoroughly
  democratic, socialized basis, then the imperialist bourgeoisie will certainly continue
  to integrate it in their fashion, with resulting misery for the masses. Centralization
  will take place; the question is on which class basis?</p>
