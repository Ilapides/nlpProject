  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: The war crisis and the global struggle (Aug. 30,
  1990)</title>

<body>
  <h1>The war crisis and the global struggle</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Aug. 30, 1990)</h5>

  <p>Of all the political problems agitating the more advanced, progressive,
  class-conscious workers and oppressed everywhere, the most thorny is the role of the
  USSR and China in the Middle East crisis. Why have they seemingly united with the
  imperialist bourgeoisie, their irreconcilable class enemy, in an adventure whose
  military dimensions are so open-ended it can only strengthen the hand of the
  imperialist militarists against them both?</p>

  <p>True, the first vote in the UN Security Council on Aug. 2 only said they were
  "alarmed by the invasion of Kuwait on August 2 by the military forces of Iraq," that
  "there exists a breach of international peace and security as regards the Iraqi
  invasion of Kuwait," and that under Articles 39 and 40 of the UN Charter they
  "condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait."</p>

  <p>The resolution called on Iraq and Kuwait to immediately begin intensive
  negotiations, saying that the Security Council would meet again and if necessary
  consider "further steps to insure compliance with the resolution." That's all.</p>

  <h4>UN vote on embargo</h4>

  <p>Then on Aug. 6, they met again and decided that "all states shall prevent the import
  into their territories of all commodities and products originating in Iraq or Kuwait or
  exported therefrom."</p>

  <p>On Aug. 9, another resolution stated they were "gravely alarmed by the declaration
  by Iraq of a `comprehensive and eternal merger with Kuwait' " and again demanded that
  Iraq withdraw immediately and unconditionally. It decided that the annexation of Kuwait
  by Iraq had no legal validity.</p>

  <p>However, the Secretary General of the UN, Javier Perez de Cuellar, has had to
  publicly complain, although in veiled diplomatic language, that the UN Security Council
  did not authorize the U.S. military buildup. Since then, the USSR has proposed a
  multilateral UN force.</p>

  <p>As we said last week, "By asking for UN intervention rather than the unilateral
  intervention of the imperialist powers, [the USSR] demonstrated a fear that this may
  turn into a general conflagration going far beyond the occupation of Iraq." It was a
  sign that the USSR was pulling back. Now this has been fully confirmed.</p>

  <h4>USSR, China pull back</h4>

  <p>"Soviet objections have so far been the main cause of the United States' inability
  to win Security Council backing for the use of force to uphold the embargo of Iraq,
  diplomats [at the UN] say," reports the New York Times in an Aug. 22 front-page
  article.</p>

  <p>Perhaps just as significantly, New York Newsday of the same date writes that "The
  ambassador from China, one of the five nations with veto power in the Security Council,
  said yesterday his country is `opposed to military involvement by big powers' in the
  Persian Gulf conflict. The statement carries an implicit criticism of the U.S."</p>

  <p>What is the significance of all this? What does it mean when the two countries once
  considered the firmest pillars of the socialist camp first vote for the condemnation
  and embargo and then pull back?</p>

  <p>Did they at first join in with the imperialists because both of them are oil
  producers and can get some narrow, temporary economic gains as a result of higher
  prices? Or was it a subtle attempt to get the imperialist colossus somewhat off their
  backs and into a war in which the U.S. would get mired down for a protracted period
  without China and the USSR getting involved?</p>

  <p>This vacillation back and forth is not based upon the duplicity characteristic of
  bourgeois imperialist diplomacy. It reflects a far deeper problem. It flows from the
  dual character of the Soviet Union and China. Both are workers' states born out of
  great socialist revolutions, but with serious deformations in their state structures
  arising from their inability to completely root out the previous social systems, which
  were based upon class oppression.</p>

  <p>Their domestic and foreign policy reflects the sociological duality of these
  workers' states: on the one hand are those forces which carry considerable baggage from
  the old class society, on the other are those who press forward. These two forces have
  been in irreconcilable struggle since day one of both revolutions. And this is
  reflected in the dual character of their foreign policy.</p>

  <p>Unless one understands the root of the problem, no clear analysis can be made of the
  complex international situation in which both countries are involved.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev's bourgeois reforms in the Soviet Union have been accompanied by an
  accommodating and capitulationist relation to imperialism and in particular to the U.S.
  Now U.S. imperialism has gone too far and alarmed the Soviet leaders.</p>

  <p>Similar circumstances motivate Chinese diplomacy as well. Before they crushed the
  counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing last June, they found the imperialist
  monopolies becoming as aggressive as they were almost 100 years ago. Now that they've
  become even more hostile, the Chinese leaders would welcome a period of relief from the
  imposed political and economic isolation.</p>

  <p>The continuing antagonism between the opposing class forces within the workers'
  states will be accompanied by serious setbacks and great advances, until the inevitable
  downfall of world imperialism and the final victory of socialism.</p>

  <h4>Bush presses for war</h4>

  <p>Now that President Bush has finally uttered the word "hostages," it is sure to
  inflame and poison public opinion in order to obscure the real causes of U.S.
  intervention in the Middle East.</p>

  <p>As in the Iran crisis, both liberal and conservative historians will undoubtedly
  bring up the Tripolitan War (1801-05 in what is now part of Libya) between the young
  U.S. government and what were then called the "Barbary pirates" in order to show how
  earlier U.S. presidents, from Adams to Jefferson to Madison, dealt with a "hostage"
  crisis in the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>The moderates are sure to argue once again that a careful, wise policy of
  disengagement brought the hostage vessels and their crews safely home. But the rabid
  interventionists will say that it was the tough policy of sending U.S. warships to
  northern Africa that paid off.</p>

  <p>That long-ago struggle is worth considering, but only in the broader perspective of
  the transition from 19th century commercial capitalism to today's monopoly capitalist
  imperialism. Only by considering such developments as milestones in the evolution of
  capitalism can a Marxist hope to arrive at correct tactical and strategic positions in
  relation to the present U.S. intervention in the Middle East.</p>

  <p>In the early 19th century, the main problem for U.S. capitalism in relation to
  European affairs was to ward off or to limit the power of Great Britain, France and
  Spain in the Western Hemisphere. The interests of U.S. commercial imperialism in Europe
  were peripheral to their basic economic, political and strategic interests.</p>

  <p>The principal thrust of the U.S. at that time was into the Western Hemisphere and
  what they called the Far East. The basis for U.S. commercial imperialism was the
  existence of slavery, the bulwark for the growth and development of what is today
  global U.S. finance capital.</p>

  <p>Presidents Adams, Jefferson and Madison had various options available to them on how
  to deal with what were called "pirates." They finally extricated themselves from a
  naval intervention in the Mediterranean. Really and truly, the U.S. only established a
  presence of any significance in the Middle East in 1866 when, through the American
  Protestant Mission, it established the Syrian Protestant College, which later became
  the American University of Beirut.</p>

  <p>For serious, revolutionary, class-conscious workers and progressives to focus on the
  so-called hostage crisis is to fix on the most superficial element in what is rapidly
  becoming a world crisis; it is to become manipulated by the capitalist media, which
  milks humanitarian instincts in order to conceal the fundamental causes of the U.S.
  intervention. How they loved to cry "Remember the Maine!" &mdash; William Randolph
  Hearst's phony slogan in 1898. How they wept crocodile tears in 1914 over "Little
  Serbia" after the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, just like those
  shed for "little Kuwait" today &mdash; Bush's own choice terminology.</p>

  <h4>U.S. cannot retreat from global ambitions</h4>

  <p>The remarkable difference between the present and the epoch of the Barbary Wars lies
  in the virtual impossibility of American finance capital in this day and age being able
  to extricate itself from its vast dominions, from its truly fabulous empire of oil and
  other resources. It is totally committed to the military, political and strategic
  positions of a worldwide colossus, and must everywhere seek to overcome all obstacles
  standing in its way in the drive for global hegemony.</p>

  <p>The springboard for the transition from early commercial imperialism to imperialism
  in the age of nuclear bombs and satellites is the scientific-technological revolution.
  The real pirates of the 19th and 20th centuries have been able to monopolize and
  develop technology as against the vast majority of the world's population. Their power,
  at least superficially, rests on this "feat."</p>

  <p>At rock bottom, however, the source of their domination is the exploitation and
  oppression of untold millions of workers and peasants, from the mountains of Peru to
  the cotton fields of Georgia and Alabama, from the textile mills of New England to the
  oilfields of Arabia.</p>

  <p>While all this must be said, it would be wholly one-sided and purely academic if we
  did not point out that the overriding tendency in both early and late capitalist
  development is to collapse like a house of cards under the pressure of the inherent
  contradictions which it accumulates over decades. Notwithstanding periods when it can
  stave off financial panics and short-term economic recessions, the inherent tendency is
  towards decay and collapse. Only militarization, only the development of a virtual
  behemoth of a military-industrial complex serving the oil monopolies and supported by
  the superbanks has been able to hold off the inevitable day of reckoning.</p>

  <p>The existence of a sharp recession is now openly admitted in the capitalist press.
  The hope of the military is that their adventure in the Middle East will divert the
  oncoming economic crisis and set in motion a new upward phase in the capitalist cycle
  of development. But this is an utterly false perspective and disregards the entire
  history of the first and second world wars.</p>

  <p>It conceals that which should be brought to the fore: Military intervention, even
  the militarization of the country, merely accelerates or delays the inherent tendencies
  present in peacetime.</p>

  <p>The same economic laws which prevail during peacetime prevail in wartime. They are
  not abolished; they merely take on a different form. What has been temporarily stifled
  eventually reappears.</p>

  <p>Do we need examples? Is it not a fact that the principal cause of the First World
  War was the growing predominance of German capitalist industry in competition with the
  British, who boasted that the sun would never set on their empire?</p>

  <p>Consider the gargantuan efforts of the U.S. to contain the economic development of
  Japan. First it mobilized all its statecraft, then its military might, ending up with
  the atomic bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. But have not the same inherent tendencies
  reappeared, even more vigorously?</p>

  <h4>Same tendencies reemerge</h4>

  <p>Two world wars for the redivision of the booty, the sweat and blood of millions of
  workers and peasants in the oppressed countries, have in no way changed the fundamental
  tendencies &mdash; the aggressive character of imperialist finance capital, the growth
  of giant multinational corporations, and their thrust for superprofits in virtually
  every corner of the globe.</p>

  <p>It is now being said (New York Times, Aug. 20, p. 6) that among other factors behind
  its Middle East intervention, the U.S. is seeking to reestablish its world hegemony in
  the light of the reassertion of economic power by Japan and Germany. There is also the
  growing significance of the struggling people of the Middle East and the vast wealth
  that is daily drawn from that area, which fills the coffers of the huge superbanks.</p>

  <p>Can a U.S. military victory, so-called, change the relentless growth of the inherent
  contradictions in the imperialist system? Can this military intervention, this
  reassertion of hegemony, even moderate the scientific-technological development of
  Japan and Germany with its consequent economic and political advantages? Or, to a
  lesser extent, that of French capitalism? Or even Canada, Australia, and the lesser
  European capitalist powers?</p>

  <p>Can even a "successful'' U.S. military intervention in Iraq stop the growing ease
  with which it is now possible to design and build supercomputers, making it more
  difficult for not only the U.S. but also Japan to keep these powerful machines from
  "proliferating" to the rest of the world?</p>

  <p>Every complex development which seemingly strengthens capitalism also discloses its
  vulnerability, not merely to competition but to capitalist overproduction. A huge
  portion of the surplus value, that is, of the sweat and blood of workers and peasants,
  is devoted to research and development. Most of it is kept under lock and key, but
  nevertheless it inevitably finds its way to the light. By hook and by crook these
  developments become widespread, which only accelerates and deepens the oncoming
  economic crisis.</p>

  <p>No wonder that the ruling circles of the U.S. are now showing a very slight but
  visible apprehension over the war, even at this early stage. It won't necessarily stop
  the coming military onslaught, but it does show that this colossus indeed has clay
  feet.</p>

  <h4>A class war</h4>

  <p>For a Marxist, the initial point of analysis is always the class character of any
  given phenomenon. What is the class character of this current war unloosed by the U.S.
  military forces? What class conducts the war and whose class interests does it
  serve?</p>

  <p>Without first answering these questions, no dispassionate, let alone scientific,
  analysis can be made. For the war is initiated, promoted and led by the capitalist
  class. In that sense, it is a class war. Who is the war conducted against? It is
  conducted against a whole group of oppressed peoples who have been exploited,
  manipulated, visited with violence and years and years of colonization, whose borders
  have been drawn and redrawn to suit the imperialist powers, whose wealth is drained to
  fatten the profits of the wealthiest capitalist countries.</p>

  <p>When the bourgeois liberals finally awaken to the dreadful significance of this war,
  the public will be reminded of the political character of Saudi Arabia. True enough.
  Saudi Arabia is not only a rare phenomenon because of its fabulous oil deposits. It is
  even more extraordinary in that it is one of the very few, perhaps the only absolute
  monarchy in the world. It has not even the semblance of a written constitution. King
  Fahd and his immediate family are responsible to no one &mdash; except the imperialist
  oil monopolies, formerly the Arabian-American Company (Aramco), which has undergone
  several reorganizations and has become state-owned, presumably nationalized.</p>

  <p>In the 1970s the Fahd clique was lionized as virtually a superpower that could
  dictate terms. Fahd's great achievement in military affairs was his purchase of U.S.
  AWACs planes, which can spy all over the area and be virtually invulnerable from
  fighter attacks. (Only American pilots can operate the planes.)</p>

  <p>But the U.S. invasion of Saudi Arabia, with no real prior permission, shows that all
  this power and independence is really an incredible, gigantic fraud. It is not the
  Saudi Arabian masses, now more than 10 million people, that are maintaining or even
  tolerating the monarchy. It is the U.S. and its imperialist allies.</p>

  <p>It is the most "democratic" countries, you see, which maintain the most archaic and
  most repressive client states on earth.</p>

  <h4>Issues for the emerging anti-war movement</h4>

  <p>The monolithic capitalist press has dutifully announced that there is virtually no
  opposition to the war (New York Times, Aug. 21, p. 16). This is calculated to
  intimidate public opinion. The movement has to clarify for itself the issues that are
  truly at stake.</p>

  <p>It is easy enough for an American to have denounced the colonialism of the French in
  Algeria, say, in the period of the Algerian struggle. It is easier for someone English
  to have denounced the U.S. invasion of Grenada than the British occupation of Northern
  Ireland or Wales.</p>

  <p>We should learn from some of the mistakes of the liberal intelligentsia in this
  country during the Vietnam War. Their position frequently began with "We should not
  support dictators in Vietnam like the Diem brothers." But this is an intrinsically
  wrong formula.</p>

  <p>The word "we" supposedly encompasses the imperialist bourgeoisie and the mass of the
  people. What's also left out here is that it wasn't the Kennedy-Johnson-Nixon policy to
  <strong>support</strong> a dictator. They <strong>created</strong> them. The oil
  companies deliberately keep a reactionary, absolutist monarchy in control in Saudi
  Arabia, without even the most superficial democratic facade, just to maintain their
  stranglehold of the profits.</p>

  <p>But in Kuwait, a much smaller country, the imperialist bourgeoisie has found it to
  their advantage to allow all the superficial political indices of sovereignty. For
  example, a so-called parliament conducts foreign relations with all governments,
  including the Soviet Union and China. It's a member of the Nonaligned Movement. So is
  Egypt. The imperialists have even encouraged this path for the Kuwaitis &mdash; as long
  as they controlled the fundamental lever, as long as the oil profits, the petrodollars,
  continued to flow into U.S. and British banks.</p>

  <p>The acid test is not whether one attacks the colonialism of a foreign power, such as
  the French, British, Germans or Japanese. That's easy. The acid test is when one
  attacks the imperialist aggression of one's own government. The deeper problem is in
  taking a thorough-going class approach to one's own capitalist government and to
  capitalism in general, especially its most aggressive stage, monopoly capitalism. Its
  most fundamental features push it constantly in the direction of unbridled military
  intervention.</p>

  <p>The principal issue in the current U.S. struggle against Iraq is not Saddam Hussein,
  just as it never was Noriega in Panama or Marcos in the Philippines (as anyone can now
  see). The peoples of those countries, and more concretely the working class, peasants
  and progressive intelligentsia, must deal with those matters. Our alliance has to be
  with the oppressed peoples in a united front against imperialism, the main enemy.</p>
