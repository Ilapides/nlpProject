  <h1>Behind the Yeltsin election</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (June 7, 1990)</h5>

  <p>In the course of historical evolution, every social system has gone through a series
  of paroxysms, the result of deep-going class contradictions which have come to the
  fore. The deeper the crisis, the more acute the political struggle becomes.</p>

  <p>Often it reaches the proportion of a struggle between two divergent class camps. The
  cry everywhere, especially if the crisis is protracted, is for firm leadership, for
  decisive steps to resolve it. All the louder are the cries when the suffering of the
  masses becomes pronounced and widespread.</p>

  <h4>Vacuum of leadership</h4>

  <p>Occasionally, however, regardless of how severely the class camps are affected, a
  vacuum of leadership tends to draw out the crisis. Such a situation occurred
  immediately after the First World War in Italy. There the crisis reduced itself to a
  struggle between two camps, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. But there was no firm
  or decisive leadership on either side and the crisis seemed to deepen rather than
  become ameliorated.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, individuals who up until then have played no prominent
  role at all in politics, figuring if at all in a peripheral sense, suddenly ponder the
  nature of the crisis and take it upon themselves to solve it, even if they have to
  change or jump from one class camp to another.</p>

  <p>Such was the case of Benito Mussolini. He was the editor of a socialist weekly but
  by no means a leader in the Italian working class movement. Yet, because of the vacuum
  created in the working class movement at the time, and seeing that the bourgeoisie was
  paralyzed, he seized the moment, put together what was called a black shirt army, and
  set up a dictatorship, not of the working class which he had originally represented,
  but of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>There is no denying that the crisis in the Soviet Union today, by its protracted
  character and its severity, has raised similar questions.</p>

  <h4>Rise of Yeltsin</h4>

  <p>Boris Yeltsin, who has just been elected President of the Russian Republic, was a
  loyal party official who rose to the ranks of the Politburo. His one outstanding
  accomplishment known of here in the West was that he facilitated the technical side of
  the construction of a gas pipeline to Western Europe, a project which the Reagan
  administration fought bitterly to obstruct.</p>

  <p>The new Politburo that took over from the old guard after Gorbachev's election as
  general secretary of the party in 1985 really gave no indication of what was in store
  for the future. Its promises of change, while sounding grandiloquent, were muted by
  comparison with earlier standards. Certainly it gave no hint that such a momentous
  crisis would be caused by its innovations and its plans to restructure virtually all
  social relations.</p>

  <p>Whatever was agreed to in secret in the early days of the new Politburo, Yeltsin
  soon became a vociferous opponent. Contemporary historians lack information on
  precisely what he opposed from the point of view of political program, and how profound
  were the plans of the Politburo for restructuring social relations, that is, class
  relations.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev restructuring was first presented to the world as a highly attractive
  plan for modernizing the scientific-technological apparatus and raising the growth rate
  of the Soviet economy. Surely this could not evoke great opposition.</p>

  <p>But Yeltsin knew more than others, and his anxiety to be ahead of the game caused
  his ouster. It was not long before the bourgeoisie recognized in him the impatient
  bourgeois reformer with a flare for demagogy and outreach to the imperialist
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <h4>His appeal to 19th Party Conference</h4>

  <p>Then came the 19th Party Conference in 1988. Seeing how successful it was in the
  eyes of the imperialist bourgeoisie, seeing the flattery that was poured on the
  conference and on Gorbachev in particular, Yeltsin attempted to regain his post in the
  Politburo. He went so far as to make a contrite appeal to the conference itself for
  rehabilitation. While it was perfectly in line with the so-called new democratic
  procedures of the conference to readmit him, the debate showed that there was a great
  deal of apprehension about him and his program.</p>

  <p>But the conference was too giddy with its own success. Most of the delegates were
  preoccupied with the praise it received outside of the USSR. The public was thrilled to
  hear all the new promises and economic proposals, even though they all ran contrary to
  past custom and procedures, especially in agriculture and heavy industry.</p>

  <p>Most of all the conference neglected to seriously consider the national question,
  treating the Azerbaijanis and the Armenians more or less as orphans without giving
  their struggle any serious attention.</p>

  <p>The real crisis of the USSR began after that conference.</p>

  <p>All those who had planned the introduction of a capitalist market, the
  decollectivization of the land, and the partial conversion of some elements of industry
  into free enterprises along with joint ventures and the like, did so, it appears now,
  in the firm belief that once the plans were adopted on paper and started to be put into
  operation, the party could be relied upon to carry them out.</p>

  <h4>Taking the party for granted</h4>

  <p>It was assumed that, under the whiplash of Gorbachev's attack on the bureaucratism
  and "command" economy of previous administrations, the party hierarchy and most of all
  the ranks would loyally support the new course. What a howling blunder! Slowly and
  gradually it dawned upon even the most unquestioning in the party apparatus that these
  plans would not get the compliance of the mass of the workers and peasants, on whom
  they were to be dumped.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev administration had been most concerned with the attacks of the
  "conservatives," the traditional loyalist leadership. Soon enough, however, it became
  clear that the real attacks were from the right, and were becoming louder and more
  impudent with each passing day. Go faster, faster, was their slogan.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that those associated with the bourgeois reform of the Soviet
  economy are actually divided into two groups.</p>

  <p>There are those who believe that introducing and widening the capitalist market is
  compatible with the state ownership of the means of production and with a planned
  economy. They are mostly to be found in the governmental apparatus and in the
  party.</p>

  <p>The other group, the more significant one for the fate of the USSR, is not at all
  interested in the maintenance of any vestige of socialism. It is for the reintroduction
  of capitalism. For them, the reforms are merely a stepping stone and a disguise for
  counterrevolution. It is this group which is growing, while confusion reigns supreme in
  the first group.</p>

  <p>A great many, sensing a sinking ship, have slowly found their way out of the party.
  This in turn has weakened both the party and the government. Gorbachev's own
  performance in taking on the exalted post of president while at the same time
  denigrating the party has encouraged the exodus.</p>

  <p>Under the exigencies of the economic crisis, Gorbachev thought the extreme rightists
  would be his most enthusiastic supporters, as they were during the very early days of
  his administration when the fight was against the conservatives. However, they have
  instead become the most demagogic of his opponents, utilizing the notorious failure of
  his economic schemes.</p>

  <h4>Political importance of economy</h4>

  <p>The miners' strike of last year put all of the political groupings on notice that if
  they hope to regain standing, they have to deal with the economic questions first and
  foremost. The inability of the government's economic officials to put through any
  workable scheme which would first and foremost improve the food situation made them an
  easy target for the real bourgeois restorationists.</p>

  <p>The miners' strike polarized Soviet society, but its demands were still at the stage
  of economism at a time when the struggle for state power is of primary significance
  &mdash; socialism or capitalism. Gorbachev is not really giving leadership which has
  any progressive meaning so far as the working class is concerned.</p>

  <p>The attempt of his various planning commissions to introduce a capitalist market
  economy and to partially dismantle socialist enterprises runs against the grain of the
  Soviet working class as well as the collectivized peasantry (let them not be
  underestimated) and has proved unworkable &mdash; something his planners never really
  thought through.</p>

  <p>They are too tantalized and mesmerized by a temporary economic conjuncture in some
  of the leading imperialist countries to take into account the long-term inevitability
  of capitalist crisis and the collapse of the so-called free enterprise system, as
  happened in the late 1920s.</p>

  <p>It's important to know that while around 1,300 joint ventures have been registered
  with the Soviets, 140 of them involving American companies, only about 200, or less
  than 15%, are operating. (Washington Post, May 27)</p>

  <h4>Prices and votes</h4>

  <p>The genius of Gorbachev's economic advisers is demonstrated by the fact that they
  announced their plans for a regulated market on May 22, seven days before the election
  in the Russian parliament for president, in which Yeltsin was considered the principal
  candidate. Gorbachev was forced to announce that the plans approved by the cabinet
  would eventually double average food prices and that the price of bread would triple
  beginning July 1. This is the first increase in the price of bread in 30 years.</p>

  <p>What bourgeois parliament would let itself in for such a debacle as to announce
  price increases in food and other commodities seven days before a crucial election?</p>

  <p>It gave a field day for all the reactionaries, all the pro-capitalist,
  pro-imperialist forces to rally behind Yeltsin.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter is that, strong as is the resurgence of the bourgeoisie in
  the USSR today, it is nowhere near making an open bid for power. For that reason,
  Yeltsin, a former Politburo member and long-standing communist with accomplishments of
  a sort in the party, is a significant help to them. He is a screen behind which they
  can hide.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Yeltsin has his international connections, and is vying with Gorbachev to
  win the support of the U.S., such as it is, for which Gorbachev is bargaining at the
  summit meeting with Bush at this very moment. It is no wonder that a Soviet observer
  accused the reformers of wanting to sell out the Soviet Union's natural resources to
  the multinational corporations. (New York Times, May 27)</p>

  <h4>The summit: the struggle continues</h4>

  <p>Regardless of the outcome of the summit meeting, and whether it ends on a
  conciliatory note, the relationship is still a struggle between two diametrically
  opposed social systems based upon antagonistic classes. The military posture of the
  U.S. does more to confirm this than anything else.</p>

  <p>Writing on the Op-ed page of the May 29 New York Times, Nikolai Chervov, a colonel
  general and member of the Soviet General Staff, noted that while the U.S. and USSR have
  made progress in reducing strategic nuclear forces, and the USSR has reduced its ground
  troops in Europe, the U.S. refuses to discuss naval reductions and the elimination of
  naval tactical nuclear weapons.</p>

  <p>"In our view, this means that the U.S., while agreeing to the reduction of both
  sides' ground forces, is striving to develop its Navy so as to achieve military
  superiority, and use this to pressure the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>"We are concerned about the hundreds of U.S. military bases encircling the Soviet
  Union....</p>

  <p>"On top of this is the `Star Wars' program; the new Stealth B-2 bomber, which is a
  first-strike weapon, and thousands of long-range air- and sea-launched nuclear-tipped
  cruise missiles.</p>

  <p>"In addition, the U.S. has refused to stop nuclear tests, and plans to equip its
  tactical aircraft in Europe with new nuclear-tipped cruise missiles that could hit
  targets beyond the Urals." It is a gloomy picture that the Soviet general presents on
  the eve of the summit meeting.</p>

  <h4>Soviet workers still offstage</h4>

  <p>The working class is still not showing any signs of rising to the realization that
  it is the most important political element in Soviet society and that politically and
  constitutionally it is the state. Its intervention in the political affairs of the
  internal struggle is still of a limited character, confined to trade union demands
  rather than for a revolutionary reconstitution of the present order of managing the
  economy.</p>

  <p>The urgent task of the working class movement is to not merely pose demands here and
  there but to assume control of the political process. In no other way is it possible to
  reinforce the dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry in alliance with all
  the progressive popular forces of the Soviet Union on a democratic, centralized
  basis.</p>

  <p>Most urgent of all is the reestablishment of international class solidarity with the
  workers in all the republics, especially those who have suffered under the policies of
  the Gorbachev administration, to return to the revolutionary internationalist policies
  of Leninism which were the envy of the whole world and a beacon light to all of the
  oppressed peoples.</p>

  <p>Yeltsin's policy is one of Great Russian chauvinism, the most vile of demagogies. He
  is in effect taking a leaf from Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who before his departure from
  the USSR wrote a letter to the Central Committee urging not just the independence of
  the Russian republic but the ouster of the other republics from the Soviet Union!</p>

  <p>The fiasco of having Gorbachev plead for the reforms, including the price increases,
  on an unscheduled nationwide TV appearance and on the eve of a summit meeting smacks of
  the poorest sort of bourgeois politics and demonstrates that not only is there no
  unanimity in his cabinet but there seems to be no concern for his own political
  future.</p>

  <p>But the struggle is far from over. On the contrary, it seems to us that it is first
  opening up.</p>
