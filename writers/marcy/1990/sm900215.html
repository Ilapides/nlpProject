  <h1>Aspects of the Central Committee meeting</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Feb. 15, 1990)</h5>

  <p>February 7 &mdash; Whoever tries to understand the nature of the deep-going crisis
  in the USSR merely on the basis of popular slogans such as democracy, pluralism,
  abolition of the single-party monopoly, will forever be deceived. One must go behind
  these political slogans and examine the materialist basis behind them, the class
  groupings which are the main motive forces in the struggle.</p>

  <p>The fundamental struggle is between those who want to retain and strengthen public
  ownership of the means of production and a planned economy in the USSR, and those who
  want to abandon it. The imperialist bourgeoisie is a very significant factor in their
  support for the latter.</p>

  <p>What is involved is nothing less than an attempt to change the social basis of the
  USSR, to fundamentally alter its class character as a workers' state, or as it has been
  popularly called, a socialist state, and foist upon it a series of adventurous
  so-called reforms which at bottom are anti-socialist. If allowed to run their course,
  they will end up with the restoration of capitalism. This must be said plainly and
  clearly.</p>

  <p>This article is written at a time when the Central Committee meeting is still in
  session, and no definitive conclusions about it can be made. Nevertheless, some matters
  have already become crystal clear.</p>

  <h4>The Feb. 4 demonstration</h4>

  <p>The first question we must ask ourselves is: Who organized the hostile, flagrantly
  bourgeois demonstration in Moscow on the day before the opening of the Central
  Committee meeting? Who inspired it? Who promoted it? Who in fact gave the go-ahead? Was
  it not the Gorbachev administration itself?</p>

  <p>This was evident from the fact that the radio, television and the press gave the
  demonstration favorable publicity beforehand. This clearly indicates coordination
  between the Gorbachev governing group and one of the fundamental pillars of the Soviet
  state, the publicly owned communications industry. The press should be neutral,
  nonpartisan when factional issues are involved. But the Gorbachev grouping used the
  press and the media for purely factional and partisan reasons, negating their
  democratic pretensions.</p>

  <p>This demonstration was the organized expression of the nascent bourgeoisie in the
  USSR. No, no, this is not a bourgeoisie which already owns the means of production and
  thereby has the right to exploit the workers. It is not the classical bourgeoisie
  reborn. It is bourgeois in the sense that its world outlook is bourgeois, that its
  social and political cravings are for individual ownership of the means of
  production.</p>

  <p>Where did they get the temerity to organize a demonstration right before the opening
  of what could be a decisive struggle against them? Those who usually are so subservient
  and obedient got their courage from Gorbachev and his grouping.</p>

  <p>This indicates coordination to appease the bourgeois elements and at the same time
  to conspire against those elements of the Central Committee now called hardliners or
  conservatives, but who in reality are more progressive on the fundamental question of
  public ownership of the means of production.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev was afraid to face up to the Central Committee, which had to deal with the
  disasters in Eastern Europe and with what could be the beginning of the disintegration
  of the USSR as a multinational state &mdash; the result of his management of the crisis
  in the Baltics as well as in the southern republics.</p>

  <p>One of the participants in the meeting, the eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov, told an
  Associated Press reporter that in addition to the 249 Central Committee members, there
  were more than 700 other officials from around the Soviet Union present and voting at
  the meeting. Who invited them? How were they selected? Even if the number is
  exaggerated, this deprives the Central Committee of unimpeded deliberation.</p>

  <p>Combined with the demonstration, all this appears to be a clear attempt to
  intimidate the relatively progressive opposition to Gorbachev on the Central
  Committee.</p>

  <p>It's quite impossible to believe that the demonstration could have taken place
  without the more progressive faction getting wind of it. That they did not organize
  their own counterdemonstration, or at least introduce a Party resolution denouncing the
  demonstration and calling on the workers, is a sign of their weakness in the face of
  this attack on the Central Committee.</p>

  <p>Unless it is put squarely that perestroika is anti-socialist, the workers will
  become bewildered, as they have been in Eastern Europe, with all the dire consequences
  of spiraling prices, unemployment and ownership of plants by foreign imperialists.</p>

  <p>The very idea that the Party leader should take such a benign attitude toward an
  outside, bourgeois grouping that is trying to intimidate the rest of the Party! It's
  altogether repugnant to any genuine communist, if not disloyal altogether to the Party
  membership. And this in a Party which once was genuinely in the vanguard and devoted
  everything to the cause of the revolution and the proletariat.</p>

  <p>Such an event would have been incredible years ago, but the policy of the Gorbachev
  regime in a nutshell is to have one foot in the camp of the Party and another in the
  camp of the openly bourgeois, pro-imperialist grouping.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev invites leaders of the so-called radical reform group, thoroughly
  bourgeois, to attend the Central Committee meeting. At the same time, he also invites
  some of the miners, all with the purpose of protecting his left and right flanks and
  making ready to jump from the camp of the Party to the camp of the outright
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>He sends the Red Army to occupy Azerbaijan (which will earn the enmity of the
  people) while fawning on and playing with the pro-imperialist popular fronts of the
  Baltic republics, the eager-beaver bourgeois elements now in the leadership who already
  consider themselves part of the imperialist camp.</p>

  <h4>Article 6 on role of Party</h4>

  <p>The meeting is reported to have voted to drop Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution,
  which defines the Communist Party as the "leading and guiding force of Soviet
  society."</p>

  <p>It's true that in Lenin's time no such clause existed in the Constitution. However,
  the Party exercised effective power as the vanguard of the revolutionary working class
  and the peasantry. It was able to exercise leadership in the Soviets, which were
  democratically organized to represent the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers.</p>

  <p>The constitutional provision has in reality become a dead letter, since the Party in
  fact validated the existence of bourgeois organizations after the 19th Party
  Conference. This includes infusing life into such right-wing organizations as Pamyat.
  These were a handful of lunatic fringe elements, considered subversive, but the
  Gorbachev regime has validated their existence and given them free rein to promote not
  only chauvinism but racism and anti-Semitism.</p>

  <p>As for the view that the Party is "giving up its monopoly on power," there hasn't
  been a monopoly in the sense that a single political tendency has dominated the
  government, since the bourgeois reformers have been inside the Party for a considerable
  period of time.</p>

  <p>How can these policies be confounded with Marxist-Leninist strategy? How is it
  possible for Gorbachev to do all this at this stage?</p>

  <p>In the first place, one has to bear in mind the 19th Party Conference of June 1988,
  which made the imperialist bourgeoisie delirious with joy. Whoever believes that
  democracy was the issue, or a minor byproduct of the conference, is deceived. It opened
  the gate to the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>That conference was packed by the Gorbachev grouping with its supporters. He had
  openly declared that only those supporting perestroika should be selected as delegates.
  The previous formulas, or quotas, which guaranteed a certain proportion of workers, of
  women, of national minorities, were thrown overboard. All this was explained in the
  media worldwide as the flowering of democracy.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev in two camps</h4>

  <p>When it comes down to the nitty gritty, the political struggle is really over the
  extension of arbitrary power by the Gorbachev leadership. It is keeping a foot in two
  antagonistic camps: on the one hand, in the Central Committee, and on the other in the
  camp of the bourgeoisie. It attempts to balance between them in the most opportunist
  way, meanwhile not having solved a single problem with its bourgeois economic reforms,
  which can neither build socialism nor topple the social system in favor of the
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>The resort to extending the political authority of the president is a time-honored
  practice of all Bonapartist regimes that seek to straddle warring class camps.</p>

  <p>No one in the working class movement is really opposed to democratization as such.
  But in the name of democracy, the form of the Soviet government has been changed in an
  undemocratic direction.</p>

  <h4>Presidential form of government</h4>

  <p>The 19th Party Conference was supposed to have discussed the relative merits of
  having a ministerial form of government or a presidential form. Our constitutionalists
  from Harvard, Yale, Princeton and UCLA all know the difference between the two. They
  know that both are in reality forms of government originally best suited for the
  bourgeoisie. Nevertheless, one is more democratic than the other. But which one do the
  imperialist well-wishers of the Gorbachev regime push for the USSR? The more democratic
  form, the ministerial one? Or the presidential form, which is less democratic?</p>

  <p>Their biggest playing card is Gorbachev himself, and trusting him with an extension
  of power is more important than being consistent to abstract democracy, even in the
  bourgeois sense.</p>

  <p>Why is one more democratic than the other? In the ministerial form of government,
  the cabinet and the prime minister are all responsible to the parliament or the
  congress. By a mere vote of lack of confidence, without the necessity of impeachment,
  the government falls, and a new one can readily be formed from the same parliamentary
  forum.</p>

  <p>The fall of the governing group does not mean the destruction of the state, or even
  its impairment. It just means that the governing group may for a time be unable to take
  significant decisions until a new government is formed. The authority to do so is
  strictly within the framework of the parliament or congress.</p>

  <p>How is it with the presidential form of government? The president is not really
  responsible to the congress or parliament. Only in rare cases can he or she be
  recalled, such as when charged with a high crime like treason. There is no provision
  for recall by the masses. (Under the Paris Commune-type of state, the original model
  for a workers' state, each individual representative of the Commune could be recalled
  by a popular vote at will.) There have occasionally been recalls of congress people,
  but never of the president of the United States. The presidency was originally
  conceived as a compromise between a monarchy and a republic. The longer the tenure of a
  president, the less the involvement of the masses.</p>

  <p>There has been an undeviating tendency in all bourgeois parliamentary governments
  for the power to continually shift from the more popular legislative branch to the
  executive branch. This is of enormous importance in evaluating the true significance of
  universal suffrage, which in itself does not enlarge the role of the masses. The
  processes of a capitalist government, even the best of them, invariably tend in the
  direction of strengthening the executive branch as against the legislative, with the
  former becoming more independent of popular control rather than less.</p>

  <p>The 19th Party Conference ended with a seeming shift of power to the much-touted,
  broadened, more popular Congress of Soviet Deputies, but at the same time real power
  was shifted into the office of the presidency (Gorbachev). In the time since the 19th
  Party Conference, the presidency has become over-stuffed with a bureaucracy as
  powerful, if not more so, than that of Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko. How come the
  bourgeois press has scarcely mentioned that?</p>

  <p>Gorbachev has mentioned over and over again that he need not have two legs, one in
  the camp of the Party and one in the camp of the presidency, which is wholly supported
  by the bourgeoisie. It is frequently rumored that he might leave the job of Party
  secretary and confine himself, as they say, to the real job of governing as
  president.</p>

  <p>The presidency as now constituted is unlike what it was. Under Andrei Gromyko, for
  example, it was mainly ceremonial, whereas now it has become the center of political
  power. Some of the bourgeois elements, prompted by U.S.-controlled "think tanks," have
  suddenly become amenable to the idea that the transition to "true democracy" may come
  in the form of authoritarian rule. Such is the real meaning of the democratic forms
  that the bourgeoisie has in mind! It has not the slightest resemblance to socialist,
  proletarian democracy. Indeed, it is the very opposite.</p>

  <p>What emerges from this plenary meeting is that Gorbachev is not more democratic, in
  the proletarian meaning of the term, but more bourgeois than his predecessors. The
  democracy is all funneled into the area of the neobourgeoisie, not to the
  proletariat.</p>

  <p>The Central Committee is confronted with a virtually new power base since the 19th
  Party Conference. For instance, there has been a significant change in the chairmanship
  of the Defense Council. This post has been transferred from the General Secretary of
  the Party to the president. So while formerly under the jurisdiction of the Central
  Committee, the armed forces, as well as the security forces, are now under the office
  of the presidency. (New York Times, Feb. 1, Op-Ed by Elizabeth Teague.)</p>

  <p>How could such an important shift away from a more democratic procedure to a more
  authoritarian role for the presidency fail to get more attention? Only because there is
  such solicitude for Gorbachev among the imperialists.</p>

  <p>Changing the Constitution clears the way for a multiparty system. What do they mean
  by that? Do they mean, for instance, that various working-class parties &mdash;
  left-wing, ultra left-wing, or moderate factional groupings &mdash; will now organize
  themselves on the programmatic basis of proletarian dictatorship in defense of
  socialist construction? Parties that will struggle against social inequality and so on?
  No, they don't mean the organization of working class parties. They mean bourgeois
  parties.</p>

  <p>The last thing they want is an organized, progressive, left-wing communist
  organization. When Yuri Afanasyev said "Long live the February Revolution" at the
  bourgeois rally on Feb. 4, he meant the bourgeois revolution in 1917 that brought
  Kerensky to power, and which was overthrown by the Bolsheviks, supported by the workers
  and peasants. By a pluralistic regime he means the Cadets, the Constitutional
  Democrats, and the Social Revolutionaries who went over to the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Look at history. In pre-war Romania, the Peasant Party was the party that decimated
  the peasantry. The Liberal Party, supposedly liberal toward the workers, killed
  workers. The names had no correspondence to the reality. One has to seek the class
  roots and composition and the orientation of the social groupings from the materialist
  interpretation of history, not on the basis of political slogans.</p>

  <p>The reason the bourgeoisie is pushing a strengthening of the presidency is to weaken
  the Party and, as Elizabeth Teague rightly says, to enable Gorbachev to govern without
  the Party.</p>

  <h4>Evolution of the bourgeoisie</h4>

  <p>The neobourgeoisie in the USSR, after being nurtured and developed over many
  decades, is attempting to demonstrate its full maturity. To understand what stage has
  been reached in its evolution, let us first of all examine the historical evolution of
  the bourgeoisie in Western Europe, toward which it expresses much kinship.</p>

  <p>Let us recall, as explained in the <em>Communist Manifesto,</em> that the
  bourgeoisie was an oppressed class in feudal society. It went through several stages as
  it gradually developed to full maturity, climbing to supremacy over the feudal lords
  and domination over the proletariat.</p>

  <p>In its earlier stages when it was still an oppressed class, long before it turned
  into an opposition party, it learned to ingratiate itself with the monarchy, to become
  its most loyal servant. In Western Europe, and in Russia under the czar, the nascent
  bourgeoisie enthusiastically served the great monarchies, especially when they were in
  need of funds, and supported them with loans and with credits.</p>

  <p>Let there be no mistake about it. Before it gathered enough economic strength to
  challenge the feudal regimes, the bourgeoisie was their most loyal servant.</p>

  <p>In Russia in the early 20th century, the development of the bourgeoisie was at the
  same time creating a profoundly revolutionary proletariat. This inhibited the
  bourgeoisie from the very beginning from becoming the principal opposition to the
  monarchy.</p>

  <p>Once the 1905 Revolution began, the bourgeoisie became frightened, not so much by
  the czar's repression against it as by the revolutionary momentum of the proletariat.
  It began to turn back any kind of opposition to the tyrannical autocracy and to
  accommodate itself in whatever way it could. It showed subservience to the czarist
  regime as long as its own class interests were most endangered by the proletariat.</p>

  <p>How relevant is all this to the history of the Soviet Union after the conquest of
  power by the working class?</p>

  <p>Immediately after the revolution, the overwhelming body of landlords, industrialists
  and bankers fled for their lives. What was left were the bourgeois intelligentsia.
  Their skills were badly needed in light of the backwardness of Russian capitalism and
  the meager cultural background of the proletariat and especially the peasantry. During
  the Leninist regime, the intelligentsia seemed cooperative, acquiescent, indulgent and
  ingratiating. They had to be because their role was really hated by the proletariat who
  looked on them as an unavoidable necessity.</p>

  <p>The same phenomenon in China led to the expression "radishes" &mdash; red on the
  outside, white on the inside.</p>

  <h4>The craving for private property</h4>

  <p>In the regimes that followed the Leninist era, with the growing chasm between the
  working class and the bureaucratic apparatus, these bourgeois elements grew in
  strength, amassing privilege, social status and a modicum of political power. But they
  lacked what is fundamental to complete the process of a bourgeoisie &mdash; ownership
  of the means of production. That is what they crave. That is what will make them a
  classical prototype of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>What stands in the way of their ownership? If you read the documents and speeches of
  the Gorbachev regime at the present time, the phrase "private forms of property" is
  being alluded to more and more. Why does it need some new definition that legislators
  have to ponder? What is so complex, that it needs redefinition?</p>

  <p>Communists are always accused of wanting to eliminate all personal property. But
  this is a slander. The distinguishing feature of communism, says the <em>Communist
  Manifesto,</em> "is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of
  bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most
  complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is
  based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few."</p>

  <p>And then comes the coup de grace to the neobourgeoisie in the USSR. "In this sense,
  the theory of the communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of
  private property." That's how Marx and Engels defined communism.</p>

  <p>This new bourgeoisie, that chatters endlessly about freedom, about pluralism, about
  different forms of property, what is it that they really are for? <strong>The
  restoration of bourgeois private property.</strong></p>

  <p>This is the rock-bottom issue. All else is camouflage and deception.</p>

  <h4>Attacks on bureaucracy</h4>

  <p>But how can this new bourgeoisie, which doesn't own the means of production, attain
  its objective? The means of production are legally in the hands of the proletariat.
  Five years of nibbling away at the socialized property belonging to the workers and the
  peasants have produced chaos, but have been unable to transfer the means of production
  from the hands of the working class to the hands of the neobourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>That's what is at the bottom of all the chatter, all the sloganeering, all the
  attacks on a "command and administrative economy."</p>

  <p>Changing all this was given the green light at the 19th Party Conference. However,
  the attainment of the objective has proved impossible, up to this very day. What stands
  in the way?</p>

  <p>The Party bureaucracy, is the answer of the bourgeoisie. They direct all their fire
  against the privileges of the Party, but they leave out the even broader stratum of
  Soviet society which enjoys even greater privileges and compensations and stands in
  sharp contrast to the workers and peasants: the managers, directors, the network of
  academic and scientific institutions, some of which are second only to the U.S. in
  number.</p>

  <p>Regressive though the politics of the Communist Party apparatus are, weakened and
  debilitated as it has become over the decades, it is nevertheless the trustee of the
  proletariat when it comes to the ownership of the means of production. The Party
  bureaucracy are the ones who hold its reins. One can say they are the trustee in
  bankruptcy, but they nevertheless are the trustee. And what the bourgeois elements are
  trying to do is dislodge them. All the fire is against the bureaucracy.</p>

  <p>But we must distinguish who is firing at whom. If we confuse the shots from the
  bourgeoisie with the early attempts of the workers themselves to raise their level and
  begin to participate in the political struggle, there is only hopeless confusion.</p>

  <p>The miners and other workers have awakened from long years of torpor and risen on
  their own spontaneously; they are now in the early stage of what Lenin called
  economism, without political direction and perspective. And precisely because of this
  they are being cajoled and flattered on all sides.</p>

  <p>The historical mission of the proletariat is being submerged in all the maneuvers
  and deceptions of the bourgeoisie and the bureaucratic apparatus.</p>
