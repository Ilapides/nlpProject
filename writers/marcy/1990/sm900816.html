  <h1>A new turn in the world struggle</h1>

  <h2>U.S. intervention in the Middle East</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Aug. 16, 1990)</h5>

  <p>August 8 &mdash; Vilification of Third World leaders opposed to U.S. intervention in
  their respective countries is not a new phenomenon in U.S. politics. But it reaches
  absolutely absurd heights when it comes to the Arab people.</p>

  <p>The lies and slander against Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1956 reached dizzying heights
  after he tried to take over the Suez Canal and the British and French organized a naval
  armada to stop him.</p>

  <p>However, when the imperialist powers' intervention subsided the popularity of Nasser
  in Egypt was overwhelming. Mass support was so wide and deep, especially among the most
  exploited and oppressed people, that it became necessary for even the gutter tabloids
  to pull back purely out of political expediency.</p>

  <p>In the contemporary era, Col. Muammar Qaddafi of Libya and Saddam Hussein of Iraq
  have shared the kind of vilification that Nasser experienced. At present, the
  imperialist press, especially in the U.S., seems to have pulled out all stops in
  slander, deceit and vilification in the case of Saddam Hussein &mdash; criminal,
  terrorist, bum, tyrant, madman, etc., etc. ad nauseam.</p>

  <p>What is really his crime? The annexation of Kuwait, a fabulously rich source of the
  oil billions flowing to the West?</p>

  <p>There is no end to the Niagara of crocodile tears for tiny Kuwait against the bully
  Saddam Hussein. The moral effluvial over the illegal annexation flows almost as rapidly
  as the Niagara of tears for what is assumed will be the terrible fate of the Kuwaiti
  people.</p>

  <h4>Illegal annexation &mdash; from California to Hawaii</h4>

  <p>Illegal annexation and occupation &mdash; that, we are told, is "the'' issue. But
  who is doing the loudest talking? Who is sending a naval and air armada equipped not
  just to retake and occupy Kuwait, but probably enough explosive power to kill millions
  of people?</p>

  <p>It's the the same capitalist government that illegally annexed California, Utah,
  Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada. Is that not so?</p>

  <p>Weren't these lands taken by force and violence? Did the Native people agree in any
  shape, form or manner to these annexations, illegal in every respect? And shall we say
  immoral? Or does morality enter into the calculations of an expansionist capitalist
  power?</p>

  <p>How long ago is it since Hawaii was annexed to the U.S. and its people suffered a
  genocide of a most incredible character? This annexation took place not in the
  immediate vicinity of the U.S. but thousands of miles away.</p>

  <p>And what about Alaska? Did the Inuits formally ask to become a state of the U.S.? Or
  was it part of a deal between two predatory robbers &mdash; the U.S. and czarist Russia
  &mdash; one of whom needed cash more badly than the other? The people had no say in the
  matter and still do not to this day.</p>

  <p>Was Louisiana the result of a mass movement to become part of the United States? Or
  was it also the result of a deal to purchase the territory and subsequently become a
  state?</p>

  <p>So far we are only dealing with the states of the U.S. But what about Puerto Rico?
  The Virgin Islands? Samoa? Guam? And those are only the ones directly annexed as U.S.
  territories.</p>

  <p>Then there are areas like the independent country of Grenada. Its revolutionary
  government was the beneficiary of a gratuitous intervention by the U.S., which almost
  all the world condemned.</p>

  <h4>European powers built by annexations</h4>

  <p>All the European states &mdash; France, Germany, Italy, Spain &mdash; all the great
  states of modern imperialist Europe are the result of amalgamations and annexations.
  Over the years there have been divisions and redivisions. Nevertheless the big European
  powers by and large include a goodly number of annexations that have been absorbed into
  the leading states and become integral parts of them.</p>

  <p>Britain still controls a part of Ireland. Scotland and Wales might have been
  independent countries except for the expansionist ability of the English. All of this
  constitutes the stages in the development of capitalism and its ultimate conversion
  into imperialism.</p>

  <p>The many splits and unifications in Europe even today are legion. Europe is not
  united. Efforts, such as those by the European Economic Community, to build a united
  Europe and abolish customs and duties at some future time would do nothing more than
  transfer the capitalist contradictions into the framework of a single economic or
  political organization. It does nothing to stop exploitation and oppression of the
  workers, or the imperialist drive for new markets, or the robbery of superprofits from
  the sweat and blood of the oppressed countries.</p>

  <p>The early annexations and amalgamations were accomplished in Europe as part and
  parcel of the bourgeois democratic revolution, spearheaded by the great French
  Revolution of 1789.</p>

  <h4>A Napoleon for the Arab people</h4>

  <p>Anwar Sadat, who succeeded Nasser and subsequently became the subservient tool of
  U.S. imperialism, was once in a heated debate with Col. Qaddafi. Sadat asked if Qaddafi
  thought he was Napoleon. It would not have been too far amiss for Col. Qaddafi to have
  answered that he would like to do for the Arab people what Napoleon's conquering army
  did for Eastern Europe.</p>

  <p>One of the truly progressive achievements of Napoleon was that his army, coming
  mostly from the peasantry with many peasant generals, abolished serfdom and feudalism
  and threw out some of the rottenest of monarchies. That was the progressive side of the
  Napoleonic wars.</p>

  <p>Nasser, Qaddafi and now Hussein face a similar problem. The problem is how to
  complete the bourgeois democratic revolution the Europeans experienced centuries ago.
  But the Arab people have been obstructed by imperialist colonization. The irrational
  divisions of the Arabian peninsula were devised to suit foreign capitalist economic
  interests. Most significant in terms of economics and finance as well as geopolitical
  considerations is the empire of oil that the U.S., Britain and some of their allies
  still own and control.</p>

  <p>To unite the Arab people in the effort to oust U.S. imperialism is a first condition
  for the emancipation of the workers and peasants as well as the rest of Arab society
  from servitude to landlords, compradore elements and the remnants of ancient clan
  dynasties who are beholden to the imperialist powers.</p>

  <p>In trying to convey the Arab quest for unity, a writer in New York Newsday (Aug. 7)
  gives this example:</p>

  <p>"Sheik Hail Sror, a dignified, elderly man whose family is of Bedouin, or nomadic,
  origin, retired last year as a member of the Jordanian parliament. Twenty years ago,
  Sror was a senator in Syria, and his first cousins, the Iraqi Srors, held important
  positions in Baghdad. Other family members live across the desert sands in Saudi
  Arabia. `We are all really just one family and one nation,' says the sheik."</p>

  <p>Arab unity in the struggle against imperialism does not necessarily mean wiping out
  the national independence of legitimate states or unwarranted amalgamations and
  annexations. Those matters are to be dealt with solely by the Arab people themselves.
  Of course, amalgamations, separations or divisions, to be regarded as progressive, must
  be free of any form of national oppression or domination of one nationality over the
  other.</p>

  <p>Under some circumstances, it may become necessary in the struggle against
  imperialism to oust imperialist puppets or occupy territory in the immediate vicinity
  where imperialism has strongly embedded itself with native royalist bourgeois
  compradore elements. If the only way to remove them is through the use of revolutionary
  force supported by the mass of workers and oppressed peoples, then it will be done.</p>

  <p>Peaceable measures are of course preferable. But imperialist colonialism rarely
  gives way to peaceable methods. Its entire history is of the use of unmitigated force
  and the cruelest violence.</p>

  <h4>Completing the bourgeois democratic revolution</h4>

  <p>The effort to complete the bourgeois democratic revolution in the conditions of
  imperialist domination and military intervention lays the basis for the transition from
  the bourgeois democratic phase directly into the socialist revolution. And this
  transition facilitates the socialist revolution.</p>

  <p>One of the tasks of socialist revolution is to free all nationalities of oppression
  and exploitation by others. Imperialism sows divisions that help it garner
  superprofits, as it has in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and as it would certainly
  like to do in the Soviet Union as well.</p>

  <p>The Arab people are not the only ones menaced by imperialism in the Middle East. The
  effort of the U.S. to make the Mediterranean Sea a U.S. lake has put the Middle East in
  danger of military intervention for many years now. No country there is safe.</p>

  <p>Few are free either from U.S. domination or its terror. The first duty of the
  progressive and working class movement in the U.S. is to call for immediate withdrawal
  of U.S. warships, troops and planes from the entire Middle East area. As has been
  pointed out again and again, the terms of the NATO treaty are supposed to be effective
  only for the North Atlantic states in the North Atlantic. Europeans and the U.S. have
  no business under that treaty of even being in the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>If ever there is a legal argument available to bolster a political struggle, this
  ought to be the easiest of all. The NATO treaty refers only to the <em>North</em>
  Atlantic, not the Mediterranean. How come so few of the bourgeois journalists ever
  refer to this?</p>

  <h4>USSR and China vote with the imperialists</h4>

  <p>A new phenomenon has arisen in this crisis. Not only has the U.S. achieved a united
  front with its imperialist European and Japanese allies. It has also drawn in China and
  the USSR.</p>

  <p>The vote by the USSR and China in favor of the UN Security Council resolution againt
  Iraq, which was initiated by the Bush administration, is not only unfortunate but
  disappointing to millions of workers and oppressed people in the Arab world and far
  beyond, who have oftne looked for help to the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>This distinguishes the current array of forces against Iraq from what happened in
  earlier economic and military confrontations by the U.S. in the Middle East.</p>

  <p>In 1958, the Iraqi Revolution exploded against imperialist domination, prompting the
  Eisenhower administration to begin naval maneuvers.</p>

  <p>The government of China at that time characterized the significance of the Iraqi
  Revolution as of the magnitude of an atomic bomb, in the sociological sense.</p>

  <p>What stayed the hand of the Pentagon then? It was the solidarity of the USSR and
  China in denouncing the Eisenhower administration for its interventionist plans.</p>

  <p>Chinese-Soviet solidarity at that time was also joined by the governments of Nehru
  in India and Sukarno in Indonesia. There was also worldwide support in many oppressed
  countries. This solidarity did much to hold back the Pentagon.</p>

  <h4>Not just a question of oil</h4>

  <p>What accounts for the difference now?</p>

  <p>Some may find the common denominator to be oil. The USSR is said to be the world's
  biggest oil producer. As such it has a stake in seeing that an embargo is placed
  against Iraq; that might conceivably facilitate the USSR's marketing efforts
  abroad.</p>

  <p>China is also a major oil producer, producing more each year than Iraq or several
  other Middle East oil states. According to the U.S.-based Energy Information
  Administration, China produced almost a billion barrels of oil in 1988, putting it in
  the top five oil producers in the world.</p>

  <p>But to say competition in oil production is the fundamental reason the USSR and
  China joined U.S. imperialism in the UN vote for sanctions against Iraq is to take a
  crude and narrow economist view of the situation.</p>

  <p>In the first place, in the earlier crises the USSR was also a huge oil producer as
  was China. But neither joined the imperialist countries &mdash; not even during the
  Arab oil boycott of 1973.</p>

  <p>The fact that the USSR and China are oil producing countries in some dimension is at
  best a peripheral fact. The real basis for their vote in the UN Security Council arises
  from a turn in the world struggle.</p>

  <p>More specifically, it is the first test since the worldwide setbacks for socialism
  in Eastern Europe. The Gorbachev administration is trying to take the view that the
  Cold War is over, and accommodate itself to U.S. imperialism's dominance in world
  affairs. Gorbachev wants to disengage the Soviet Union from confrontation with
  imperialism with regard to the national liberation movements and the struggles of
  oppressed peoples.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev administration has capitulated in the worldwide struggle between
  capitalism and socialism. It has set this adventurous course in order to save itself
  from the disaster of pursuing bourgeois economic reforms. These reforms have not only
  slowed down industry but also resulted for the first time in a decline in the gross
  national product and labor productivity in the USSR.</p>

  <p>As for China, its basis for joining the U.S. imperialist initiative in the UN is an
  attempt to get out of the isolation imposed on it by the U.S. since it crushed a
  counterrevolutionary uprising last year.</p>

  <p>How long this strange alliance will hold is another question in view of plans of the
  Pentagon to militarily intervene.</p>

  <p>The USSR is also sending warships into the area. The capitalist press is explaining
  this as part of the new political accommodation with the U.S. We hope not. The USSR has
  done this previously when the U.S. sent in its warships. It was regarded as a defensive
  measure since the U.S.'s nuclear-equipped ships could more easily reach the USSR from
  the Mediterranean and the Arabian Gulf. So, it may be an ambiguous military maneuver
  that the USSR's ships are in the same area as U.S. warships. They may not necessarily
  be there to facilitate the U.S.-NATO military aggression.</p>

  <h4>Danger of a wider conflagration</h4>

  <p>For the present, however, the danger lies in the possibility that the imperialist
  brigandage could turn into a world conflagration, despite promises that the Cold War
  has ended.</p>

  <p>The U.S. objective in the Cold War has always been to keep oppressed peoples in
  Latin America, Africa and Asia subjugated under the yoke of finance capital and the
  super-profits it garners. For decades the USSR has stood in the way as an obstacle to
  U.S. imperialism and, together with Peoples China, acted as a brake on the U.S. in its
  drive for economic and political dominion over the globe.</p>

  <p>Can the fact that China along with the USSR and its allies are supporting an
  imperialist venture make that much of a difference?</p>

  <p>Let us not discount the inherent contradictions in imperialism, which make it
  vulnerable to a worldwide anti-imperialist and working class upsurge. At each step in
  the development of capitalism the working class and the oppressed masses generally have
  been the single most potent force to not only restrain capitalist imperialism's
  inherent tendencies to expand, but to overthrow it.</p>

  <p>On Aug. 4, 1914, who thought that three years later the absolutist czarist
  government of Russia &mdash; the gendarme of Europe and bulwark of reaction that always
  had the support of European capitalism &mdash; would be overthrown and all of Europe
  would be aflame with revolutionary working class struggle?</p>

  <p>If U.S. imperialism and its NATO allies are ready to take the kind of catastrophic
  plunge in the Middle East they are planning, they will ultimately suffer the same
  consequences. Imperialism is a colossus. But it has clay feet.</p>
