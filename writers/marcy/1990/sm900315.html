  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: What dual power means in Nicaragua (March 15,
  1990)</title>

  <h1>What dual power means in Nicaragua</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 15, 1990)</h5>

  <p>It is of course very heartening to progressive, working class and oppressed people
  to hear that the Sandinista leadership will resist all efforts to dismantle the
  People's Army, to liquidate its revolutionary mission, and to dismantle the progressive
  political and social institutions which have been built up by the sweat and blood of
  the workers and campesinos during this entire decade of war devastation.</p>

  <p>Resistance against any infringement of the role of the People's Army is of course
  paramount. That is of the highest priority, for allowing any vacillation on this
  question would tend to lead to disaffection and demoralization among the ranks.
  Firmness of the leadership is the best guarantee for maintaining the revolutionary
  integrity of the armed forces and the security organizations.</p>

  <p>The state, as we said in our article last week, consists in its essence of the
  bodies of armed men and women who defend the class in power. But it also embraces a
  whole complex of social and political institutions. In the case of a revolutionary
  workers' state, the popular institutions enable the masses to participate directly in
  the defense of the revolution.</p>

  <p>In Nicaragua, this includes the Sandinista Workers Confederation, the Association of
  Agricultural Workers, the Nicaraguan Students Union, the Secondary Students Federation,
  the Federation of Health Workers, the National Confederation of Professionals and the
  National Teachers Union &mdash; all of which have been "key organizing units" for
  recent demonstrations in defense of the gains of the revolution.</p>

  <h4>Situation of dual power</h4>

  <p>It is still less than two weeks since the elections which so elevated the
  expectations of the counterrevolution, yet already there is talk from both sides in
  Nicaragua warning of civil war, chaos and anarchy. These expressions are typical of the
  language used when the main social forces find themselves in an irreconcilable
  struggle.</p>

  <p>It is plain that a state of dual power has emerged in Nicaragua.</p>

  <p>Dual power arises in situations of acute social crisis, when the antagonisms between
  the classes have matured to the point where each challenges the other for the
  sovereignty or leadership of the country. Such a condition of acute crisis cannot last
  for any considerable period. The kind of challenge which each has delivered to the
  other can only stem from irreconcilable class contradictions, and a resolution is
  generally possible only on the basis of the victory of one or the other.</p>

  <p>Dual power has emerged in all the great revolutions of modern times. As we have
  pointed out in earlier articles, it appeared as long ago as the English Revolution
  &mdash; the King versus the Parliament. It was certainly true in the French Revolution
  &mdash; the Third Estate against the royal power. And it was eminently true in the
  Russian Revolution &mdash; the Soviets against the Kerensky regime. Kerensky had only
  the legal trappings of power after the downfall of the czar; in reality, power was in
  the hands of the Soviets, which were composed of workers', soldiers' and peasants'
  deputies. But it took the leadership of the Bolsheviks before the Soviets would
  actually exercise power in the interests of the workers and peasants.</p>

  <p>There was dual power in the U.S. leading up to the Civil War. As the historian
  Charles Beard said, the conflict was irrepressible and couldn't be avoided, as much as
  both sides wanted to find a compromise. It was impossible because the North and South
  were based on different social systems, wage slavery versus chattel slavery. Chattel
  slavery was incompatible with capitalist production, which needed free labor to
  exploit.</p>

  <p>More recently, dual power emerged in China &mdash; the People's Liberation Army
  against the Chiang Kai-shek forces. Vietnam, Korea, Cuba &mdash; in all cases there was
  a popular armed force that developed to the point of challenging the state power of the
  old ruling classes. And in Nicaragua itself the People's Army developed in the
  guerrilla war against the Somoza regime.</p>

  <p>The peculiarity of dual power today in Nicaragua is that the film is in reverse.
  Here the counterrevolution, under the figleaf of bourgeois parliamentarism, is
  asserting legal and political authority for a small mercenary grouping, wholly in the
  pay of imperialism, which seeks control over the state of the workers and peasants and
  moreover over the People's Army. Such a situation cannot last for long.</p>

  <p>The pro-imperialist Chamorro clique is in reality a shadow with no substance, but it
  has obtained legal status through the elections. The real substance of the
  counterrevolution lies in external factors, in the threat of imperialist brigandage
  which looms over Nicaragua at all times but has been successfully held at bay by the
  People's Army and revolutionary mass organizations.</p>

  <h4>Delaying tactics</h4>

  <p>The effort by the UNO pro-imperialist grouping to at this time circumnavigate around
  the economic infrastructure and the military and security forces instead of taking them
  head on is a threadbare, dilatory maneuver. It's a typical lawyer's trick to delay
  while gathering more forces, both economic, material and military, in order to overcome
  and destroy the revolutionary state of workers and peasants.</p>

  <p>On the other side, after a momentary period of confusion, it now appears as of March
  6 that there is a growing realization that what is at stake in any further conciliation
  with the enemy is the dismantling and liquidation of the state of the workers and
  peasants.</p>

  <p>It is not a matter of being more flexible, of winning a concession here or there, or
  of mutual concessions in order to moderate the clash of class interests. What is
  involved is the destiny of the revolution, the destiny of the new social system.
  Embryonic though it may be in form, the revolutionary Nicaraguan state represents the
  essence of progress as against an enemy which, although cloaked in a democratic form
  for now, has as its essence nothing but the most brutal kind of colonial
  domination.</p>

  <p>The transition talks are a mask while deliberate preparations go on for the next
  stage in an attempt to take over the state. Washington is constantly counseling its
  stooges to tread carefully, not to provoke a revolutionary response from the Sandinista
  government. But some of the contra leaders, this varied assortment of mountebanks,
  bandits, and outright indiscriminate killers, do not understand the delicacy of the
  situation. Hence Washington has sent down its proconsul, Harry W. Shlaudeman, a special
  consultant to the State Department, to explain it to them.</p>

  <p>But disregarding this or that incident, this or that statement from either side, the
  issue is, does or does not dual power exist? Do there not exist two camps resting
  entirely on two different classes, the exploiters and the exploited? And can this be
  bridged by political manipulation in times of acute social crisis, times when the
  classes are poised on a razor's edge?</p>
