  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Peace talk and war preparation (Oct. 18,
  1990)</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Peace talk and war preparation</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Oct. 18, 1990)</h5>

  <p>October 9 &mdash; Even as talk of a peaceful solution to the Middle East crisis
  escalated over the past week, the giant U.S. aircraft carrier Independence was moving
  into the Gulf, its deck crammed with attack planes and escorted by a battle group of
  smaller warships and mine sweepers.</p>

  <p>This move alone speaks volumes and belies President Bush's less bellicose speech to
  the United Nations. The deployment of troops, weapons, ships and planes to Saudi Arabia
  has not stopped for one minute.</p>

  <p>Nor should anyone be fooled by the play-acting in Washington about the military
  budget being cut. The Pentagon got everything it wanted in the little conspiracy with
  key Congressional leaders hatched at Andrews Air Force Base (see WW article, Sept. 27).
  That has not been changed. Except for the phasing out of a few obsolete bases, any
  military cuts are far in the future and don't affect the current struggle.</p>

  <p>Our problem is to assess the peace talk, which is words, against the actual
  deeds.</p>

  <p>Peace talk by the ruling capitalist establishment is always calculated to paralyze
  the struggle of the working class and oppressed against the war. Let's not be fooled by
  it. Indecision on the eve of every great war crisis is a characteristic feature of
  adventurous imperialism. It does not affect the objective direction of the
  military-industrial complex or the essence of the struggle, which is for the redivision
  of the world's resources by the imperialist oppressors.</p>

  <p>Capitalist peace talk tends to paralyze the anti-war forces while leaving the
  initiative solidly in the hands of the imperialists. Forgetting the above is to risk
  demoralizing the growing resistance to the Gulf war, which is also responding to racism
  and to unemployment arising out of the economic crisis.</p>

  <p>No admiral, no general, no Pentagon officer has breathed a word about pulling back
  or hesitating to use military force. All the peace talk is based on surmises. Every
  single word uttered about a diplomatic solution is hedged by a saving clause that
  points to military action.</p>

  <h4>Cracks in the plans?</h4>

  <p>However, that shouldn't stop us from examining some critical aspects of the
  struggle, or from pointing out cracks and miscalculations in the Bush-Pentagon grand
  plan for a unified worldwide front organized by imperialism against the oppressed
  people.</p>

  <p>In order to understand the current phase of the war crisis and its intimate
  connection to the budget struggle, it is worth considering some key developments of the
  last two weeks. All are intertwined with the looming economic crisis now acknowledged
  by almost all the capitalist economists and evident in such significant developments as
  the rise in unemployment, including layoffs in such sensitive areas as the banks, led
  by Chase Manhattan.</p>

  <p>The imminent attack on Iraq, which had been announced in scare headlines just two
  weeks ago, has been moved to the inside pages. Most of the networks have begun to put
  the war crisis second or third on the news and focus on the budget crisis instead. This
  is understandable, but the budget issue is a sham struggle which will end up as a
  compromise that does not resolve the financial crisis of the capitalist government
  arising out of its unprecedented indebtedness on a world scale.</p>

  <p>Let's understand, but not give much credence to, the reports that the so-called
  doves in the ruling establishment, led by Zbigniew Brzezinski and (if we are to believe
  the reports) certain elements in the National Security Council and State Department,
  seem to have suddenly got the upper hand.</p>

  <p>Note, however, that nobody says Brent Scowcroft &mdash; Bush's National Security
  Adviser and a protege of Kissinger and the Rockefeller dynasty &mdash; is a dove.
  Moreover, Secretary of Defense Cheney, a front man for the Pentagon, has been
  characterized as leading the hawks.</p>

  <p>The capitalist press is saying virtually nothing about the developments of real
  significance. What is the meaning of the dismissal of General Michael Dugan, former
  Chief of the Air Force, the military branch most crucial in a blitzkrieg against Iraq?
  There has been no discussion, no articles in the public press, no explanation.</p>

  <p>His firing seemed, at least based on its superficial appearance, to represent a
  shift of actual policy. Lending support to this conception is the position of
  Brzezinski, as outlined in the New York Times of Oct. 7. Henry Kissinger also has toned
  down his position of Aug. 20; at that time, in an opinion piece for the Washington Post
  and other papers, he called for the immediate destruction of the Iraqi regime.</p>

  <p>Next we have to consider Bush's Oct. 1 talk to the UN, where he virtually came out
  for a diplomatic solution, while at the same time refusing to give up his military
  options. In this talk, Bush endorsed what he had turned down just a few days earlier
  &mdash; an overall settlement in the Middle East to go along with an Iraqi withdrawal
  from Kuwait. How did this change of position come about?</p>

  <h4>Failed to get Soviet support for military attack</h4>

  <p>The class-collaborationist Gorbachev administration, which has been enticed more and
  more into the orbit of U.S. imperialism, has been giving political support to the U.S.
  campaign against Iraq. However, at the end of the Bush-Gorbachev press conference in
  Helsinki when Bush directly referred to military support for the U.S. action in the
  Gulf, Gorbachev pulled back from the brink.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Soviet political support of the resolutions at the UN Security Council
  sanctioning and embargoing Iraq &mdash; such harsh, just-short-of-war measures &mdash;
  gave the imperialists a handle to try and draw the USSR further into acquiescing to or
  even joining in a military attack.</p>

  <p>But, after all the talk of collaboration with the imperialists, after all the mutual
  friendship declarations and support of U.S. imperialism's policy against Iraq, with the
  Soviet leaders denouncing the Iraqi regime and Hussein himself, and even after the
  brazen speech made by Shevardnadze at the UN in which he virtually tied the USSR to the
  war machines of the U.S. and its imperialist allies &mdash; the Soviet leaders pulled
  back from supporting an outright U.S. military attack.</p>

  <p>The statements of love and affection were fine, but what the U.S. military
  establishment wanted to know was: Are you going to approve a military attack? Are you
  joining with us in it? That was the big question.</p>

  <p>If you re-read Shevardnadze's speech and go over Gorbachev's press conference with
  Bush, you see they could not get themselves to say yes to that.</p>

  <p>It must have been a keen disappointment to the imperialist establishment and showed
  that the Gorbachev administration was reluctant and fearful of any such step.</p>

  <p>This caused the ruling establishment here to look for other avenues than Gorbachev
  and Shevardnadze. They wanted to test whether the Gorbachev grouping had been hindered
  from completely collaborating with U.S. imperialism by the military in the USSR.
  Assurances by Gorbachev that the military was in support of all his policies were not
  enough. The Pentagon as well as the Bush administration wanted to see for themselves
  whether the military was hindering the policy of class collaboration, including
  military action.</p>

  <h4>Invited Soviet Chief of Staff</h4>

  <p>So they went over the head of Gorbachev and invited the chief of the Soviet
  military, General Mikhail A. Moiseyev, to come to the U.S. This was not in accord with
  diplomatic procedures. The sudden invitation by U.S. Chief of Staff Colin Powell to the
  Soviet Chief of Staff was an extraordinary development.</p>

  <p>None of the military chiefs of the Western imperialist powers, so far as we know,
  has met with General Powell with regard to the Gulf crisis. Not the French, Germans or
  Japanese. Powell did make a visit to Saudi Arabia, but that was intended as a morale
  builder for the troops.</p>

  <p>It's all the more unusual because such a meeting is only proper after political
  agreement has been reached. Notwithstanding all the effusive praise by Gorbachev for
  U.S. policy, the Gorbachev administration was not for the use of force, not for a
  military solution. That was the bottom line.</p>

  <p>Therefore, there was no need to discuss military coordination, no need to have a
  meeting of the military chiefs of staff. It was a political matter and was being
  discussed between Bush and Gorbachev, then Baker and Shevardnadze.</p>

  <p>The Soviet Chief of Staff is an appointee presumed to be a supporter of Gorbachev.
  But how much power the Chief of Staff exerts over the military, or is representative of
  their views, is open to question. It was an unorthodox procedure between allies to
  invite the Chief of Staff and attempt to probe the differences, since the political
  answer had already been given.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Pentagon began to fish in troubled waters. Even within the framework
  of this pro-imperialist collaboration, it would have been more proper for the Gorbachev
  regime to either politely accept the invitation but postpone it to a distant time after
  the crisis, or politely reject it. But the Gorbachev administration is not known for
  being adamant in relation to imperialism and must have agreed with great reluctance. It
  was revealed as weak and vulnerable in relation to imperialism.</p>

  <p>This act of brazen intervention in the internal affairs of the USSR pushed the
  Gorbachev administration as far as it could go. But fortunately it appears that the
  general stuck even more pointedly to the policy of not using force. He conveyed the
  impression that the military was solidly opposed to intervening on behalf of U.S.
  imperialism.</p>

  <p>All this was covered in an article in the New York Times of Oct. 3 headed "Top
  Soviet General Tells U.S. Not to Attack in Gulf," based on a special interview given by
  General Moiseyev to writers and editors of the Times. Parts of what he said are
  outrageously offensive and arrogant to the Iraqis. The net result, however, is that the
  trip wasn't worth two cents to the Pentagon. They wanted to know from the general if
  the Soviet military was supportive of an intervention or not. And they found out that
  the military was very strongly opposed to it.</p>

  <p>Thus the Bush administration found out what many specialists in the imperialist
  think tanks have known &mdash; that the military in the Soviet Union is not
  pro-imperialist, certainly not to the extent of pulling the chestnuts out of the fire
  for the U.S. in the Middle East. This reflects what still remains of the social system
  created by the October Revolution, and shows that the bourgeois grouping in the
  leadership fears the class-conscious workers, collectivized peasantry and progressive
  intelligentsia. It is a key factor in trying to understand what's behind the halt in
  the war talk, at least for now.</p>

  <h4>Differences among imperialists resurface</h4>

  <p>Also, the old and abiding differences in the imperialist camp began to surface after
  it was made clear that there was a limit to the collaboration of the USSR's bourgeois
  ruling group with U.S. imperialism. While earlier there had been great jubilation in
  the U.S. press about the solidity of the alliance against Iraq, a vitriolic editorial
  in the Oct. 8 New York Times ("Who Will Pay for the Gulf Crisis?") assails the
  imperialist allies and the client states in the Middle East for not contributing
  enough.</p>

  <p>The appearance of these differences is altogether in harmony with the laws of
  capitalist development and its drive in the imperialist epoch for the redivision of
  world markets and sources of raw materials and super-exploited labor.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the deployment is continuing. The inherent tendency of the imperialist
  monopolies faced with a domestic crisis is to find an external, military solution. One
  question stands in the way: Will military expansion solve the economic crisis?</p>

  <p>Unlike earlier economic collapses, this one comes at a time when the military has
  already been built up to such gargantuan proportions that it's difficult for even the
  most ultra-imperialist elements to see how much further that can go. With the banks
  themselves in danger of losing their credit, the capitalist establishment isn't sure
  whether the military solution will mitigate the economic crisis or deepen it.</p>

  <p>Will they go ahead anyway and risk a firestorm of simultaneous rebellions throughout
  the Middle East? Will they arouse the masses of people at home by dragging them into an
  already unpopular war at the same time that the workers are bracing for a domestic
  economic crisis of unknown proportions? These are the enormous calculations that have
  given the imperialist strategists pause. But only for the moment. For the historical
  tendency of imperialist militarism is to expand, even in the face of obvious economic
  contraction.</p>
