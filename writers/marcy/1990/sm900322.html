  <h1>Mass organizations vs. National Assembly</h1>

  <h2>The choice in Nicaragua today and in Russia, 1918</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 22, 1990)</h5>

  <p>The gut question arising from the recent elections in Nicaragua concerns the
  legitimacy of the new National Assembly, in which a majority of the legislators will be
  from the counterrevolutionary UNO grouping, as a governing group for the Nicaraguan
  people.</p>

  <p>In our earlier articles we pointed out that this bourgeois coalition grouped around
  Violeta Chamorro was funded by the U.S., notably the National Endowment for Democracy.
  The facts are uncontested. The NED is called a nongovernmental group but is wholly
  funded by the U.S. Congress.</p>

  <p>In fiscal years 1989 and 1990, Congress appropriated $12.5 million for the NED to
  use in the Nicaraguan electoral process, according to a report in Covert Action (No.
  33, Winter 1990) by two very responsible writers, William Robinson and David
  MacMichael. The former is author of "David and Goliath: the U.S. War Against Nicaragua"
  and the latter is a former CIA analyst and outspoken critic of U.S. intervention who
  researches and writes on U.S. foreign policy.</p>

  <p>In this report, written before the election, the writers estimated that the money
  funneled to the counterrevolution by the NED averaged out to about $10 per Nicaraguan
  voter, and is "the equivalent of a foreign power injecting $2 billion into a U.S.
  electoral campaign."</p>

  <h4>Totally lacking in legitimacy</h4>

  <p>Does not this odious example of bribery and corruption alone disqualify the new
  National Assembly from asserting any kind of legitimacy? Would any sovereign government
  willingly tolerate it, a government which had the authority and support of its workers
  and peasants?</p>

  <p>For the revolutionary government to participate in this forum would be to lend
  legitimacy to that which is fraudulent and corrupt and the product of a howling
  miscalculation.</p>

  <p>What can be done?</p>

  <p>There is a ready-made instrument of the revolution which can in part counteract this
  bought-and-paid-for legislature. The revolution for over ten years has created a
  complex of mass political, social and economic institutions. These organizations were
  born and bred in the cauldron of civil war and intervention and have grown to maturity.
  Leaving aside incidental desertion or erosion here and there, which could be expected
  in any such situation, these mass organizations constitute the most formidable pillar
  of the revolution.</p>

  <p>Who are they? They are the Sandinista Workers Confederation (CST), the Association
  of Agricultural Workers (ATC), the Nicaraguan Students Union (UNEN), the Secondary
  Students Federation (FES), the Federation of Health Workers (FETSALUD),the Luisa Amanda
  Espinoza Nicaraguan Women's Movement(AMNLAE), the National Confederation of
  Professionals (CONAPRO) and the National Teachers Union (ANDEN).</p>

  <p>Moreover, the social composition of the rank and file of the People's Army is drawn
  from the same classes, the workers and peasants. It was very encouraging that, at a
  huge demonstration in Managua on International Women's Day, the leadership gave many
  assurances that the social gains and the infrastructure of their organizations,
  including the army and the security forces, would remain intact. Similar speeches have
  been made before the trade unions and the agricultural workers.</p>

  <p>But there is something conspicuously absent that strikes even an observer from afar
  as of the greatest and most critical importance. Which is that to date, since the
  unfortunate development of the election, there has been no combined assembly of these
  mass organizations.</p>

  <h4>Need for a popular assembly</h4>

  <p>That would mean a giant leap forward. It would symbolize the fact that here lies the
  real legislative body of the revolution. Here is the authentic body grown and nurtured
  by the revolution which is representative of the people and has both the legal and the
  de facto power to initiate and carry out legislation introduced by the governing
  revolutionary leadership.</p>

  <p>The body which will formally take office on April 25 is a bogus, deceitful
  instrument of imperialist domination, which is the result of a miscalculation and an
  unwarranted concession to bourgeois parliamentarism.</p>

  <p>Let us again cite the Covert Action article as a reminder of what really happened in
  the election. "There are four `core' groups [in the U.S.] which receive most of their
  funding from NED and which are tied to different facets of the U.S. political and
  foreign policy structure. These groups are the National Democratic Institute for
  International Affairs (NDI) and its Republican counterpart, the National Republican
  Institute (NRI) (the international affairs department of the Democratic and Republican
  parties, respectively), the Free Trade Union Institute (FTUI) (the operational part of
  the American Institute for Free Labor Development [AIFLD], whose ties to the CIA are
  well documented and which acts to generate moderate, pro-U.S. labor movements in Latin
  America), and [surprise, surprise] the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center on
  International Private Enterprise (CIPE)." They worked as "major conduits" for funding
  of the Nicaraguan opposition.</p>

  <p>How in the world could an election held under such circumstances be even remotely
  regarded as valid?</p>

  <h4>Two centers of power based on opposing classes</h4>

  <p>The mass organizations are the <em>legitimate</em> national assembly. These two
  centers of power are really based on two different class compositions, and this is
  probably clearer in Nicaragua than in previous analogous situations.</p>

  <p>This question as to which legislature should exercise state power concerns not only
  Nicaragua. It is a world question, because some of the most fundamental problems
  concerning revolutionary working class strategy are common to all revolutions in the
  modern era, and are likely to be repeated again and again.</p>

  <p>Lenin in his pamphlet "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" wrote that the
  Russian Revolution had international significance, and explained this to mean that
  there was the historical inevitability of the repetition of certain of its fundamental
  features on an international scale.</p>

  <p>It is precisely this question, the inevitability of the repetition of basic features
  of the Russian Revolution elsewhere in the world historic struggle of the oppressed
  peoples and the working class, that concerns us. In particular, we will examine the
  question of the relation of bourgeois parliamentarism to the nature of the state.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, the Nicaraguan bourgeoisie and UNO, its political expression led
  by Chamorro (which is just an extension of the imperialist bourgeoisie), are attempting
  in every way possible to legitimatize the National Assembly as the sovereign power of
  the state. They are trying to ensure that the National Assembly and the presidency
  shall have the right to govern and to subordinate the above-mentioned mass
  organizations and the People's Army to their will.</p>

  <p>It is absolutely necessary to put this situation into a historical perspective of
  the broadest character. This may appear to be a diversion, but in reality it retains
  the greatest relevance to the condition of dual power that exists between the de jure
  Chamorro governing group and the de facto state of the workers and peasants as
  reflected in the mass organizations and the People's Army.</p>

  <p>The situation is analogous to the best-known experience of the Russian Revolution,
  down even to some of the details. But let us begin with the most authoritative and
  eminent theoretician of the Second International, Karl Kautsky (1854-1938).</p>

  <h4>Karl Kautsky and the Soviets</h4>

  <p>Kautsky showed a keen interest in the political struggles of the working class in
  Russia and of the Social-Democratic movement there far exceeding other foreign
  observers. For instance, in 1902, he wrote an article for Iskra, the Russian
  Social-Democratic paper, about the Russian revolution, in which he said:</p>

  <p>"At the present time ... it may be assumed that not only have the Slavs entered the
  ranks of the revolutionary peoples, but that the center of gravity of revolutionary
  thought and revolutionary action is moving farther and farther to the Slavs. The
  revolutionary center is moving from the West to the East. In the first half of the
  nineteenth century, this center was in France, and for some time in England. In 1848,
  Germany entered the ranks of revolutionary nations. The new century is being ushered in
  by such events as induce us to think that we are confronted by a further removal of the
  revolutionary center, namely, to Russia. Russia, which has imbibed so much
  revolutionary initiative from the West, is now perhaps itself ready to serve as a
  source of revolutionary energy. The Russian revolutionary movement, which is now
  bursting into flame, will, perhaps, become the strongest means for the extermination of
  the senile philistinism and sedate politics which is beginning to spread in our ranks,
  and will again rekindle the militant spirit and the passionate devotion to our great
  ideals."</p>

  <p>You'll excuse us for quoting at such length, but it is so true and so correct. As
  Lenin said, how well Kautsky wrote back then!</p>

  <p>But Kautsky was opposed to the seizure of power by the Soviets, under the leadership
  of the Bolsheviks. And because of that, it is commonly believed he was opposed to the
  Soviets in general. This is not so.</p>

  <p>What were the Soviets? They were the councils of the workers, peasants and soldiers
  that arose with the revolution and included representatives of many mass organizations
  of the oppressed, especially the urban and rural poor. The times have changed, but the
  mass organizations in Nicaragua today are fundamentally the same in class composition
  and in the spontaneous manner in which they arose out of the insurrection and grew
  stronger in the years of war and devastation.</p>

  <p>Was Kautsky opposed to the Soviets? No. He even wrote about how in the earlier
  revolution in 1905, the Soviets created "the most all-embracing form of proletarian
  organization, for it embraced all the wage workers." (Quoted by Lenin in "The
  Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky.") Isn't this true of the trade union
  movement in Nicaragua?</p>

  <p>Thus we see that within the Social-Democratic movement, both the Bolsheviks
  (majority) and the Mensheviks (minority) with whom Kautsky was affiliated were all in
  agreement on the Soviet form of organization. It already had a great and glorious
  history.</p>

  <p>The old methods of economic and political struggle by the working class, Kautsky
  continued, cannot be discarded and are still indispensable, "but from time to time
  tasks arise which they cannot fulfill, tasks that can be successfully fulfilled only by
  a combination of all the political and economic instruments of force of the working
  class."</p>

  <p>Kautsky is saying here that trade union economism is not sufficient; that tasks
  arise which require the workers to set up political organizations, to put "politics in
  command," as Mao Zedong said. Here there was almost solid agreement between the
  Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.</p>

  <h4>Should the Soviets take the power?</h4>

  <p>Yet in 1917 a tremendous difference arose between them on the new role of the
  Soviets &mdash; and it is critical to the current situation in Nicaragua. What was this
  difference?</p>

  <p>The Bolsheviks raised the slogan, "All power to the Soviets!" The Mensheviks, whose
  theoretical mentor was Kautsky, said no.</p>

  <p>What did the Mensheviks want? They wanted the Soviets to be regarded as the
  principal organization of the working class. But as for state power, that should rest
  in the Constituent Assembly, the bourgeois parliamentary organization. And this when
  the Soviets in fact had spontaneously become the state power, since they were
  splendidly organized and armed.</p>

  <p>The similarities to Nicaragua are obvious. The mass organizations and the People's
  Army (the Soviets) have the legal authority and must retain it as against the National
  Assembly (the Constituent Assembly). The overwhelming element of foreign intervention
  in the creation and funding of UNO makes the legitimacy of the revolutionary government
  in Nicaragua even clearer.</p>

  <h4>`Do the Soviets dare become the state?'</h4>

  <p>Of course, anyone could pour out praise for the Soviets, and most did. But the
  question was, should the Soviets, the complex of mass organizations and the People's
  Army, declare themselves to be the state power? As Lenin put it, "Do the Soviets dare
  become state organizations?&lt;170</p>

  <p>This point, which seemed obscure, turned out to be of the greatest world historic
  significance for the working class movement.</p>

  <p>The question was how to characterize the Constituent Assembly. The bourgeoisie on a
  world scale praised it as a "democratically constituted organization based on universal
  suffrage, expressing the will of the people, etc." But, notwithstanding all the palaver
  about the will of the people, universal suffrage, etc., was it not in reality
  expressing the will of the landlords and the bourgeoisie?</p>

  <p>And does not the incoming National Assembly in Nicaragua &mdash; chosen by universal
  suffrage in free elections embodying the will of the majority, with poll watchers and
  international observers, etc. &mdash; represent the aspirations of the imperialist
  bourgeoisie?</p>

  <p>Are we to put the question on the basis of pure formal democracy, or are we to put
  it on the basis of the existence of antagonistic classes, and decide which class
  created, supported and promoted the pro-imperialist clique of Chamorro and Co.? Is this
  not a class question of the greatest significance?</p>

  <h4>Bourgeois democracy vs. socialist democracy</h4>

  <p>Formal bourgeois democracy had its progressive side in the struggle against feudal
  absolutism, but it has an entirely different social and class content in the context of
  the present situation in Nicaragua. The struggle is not between the old landlordism and
  rising, nascent capitalism. It is between a capitalist democracy and a proletarian
  socialist democracy. The class composition of each will elucidate their political
  difference.</p>

  <p>After months of struggle over whether they should assert their authority over that
  of the Constituent Assembly, the Soviets under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party
  finally decided in October to seize the power (which was in their hands anyway). They
  then dispersed the bourgeois parliament, the Constituent Assembly, as being the
  repository of the material interests of the landlords, the industrialists and the
  imperialist powers, who already were poised to attack the Soviet power. Lenin read a
  declaration declaring the Soviets to be the state power and sent the bourgeois
  legislators home.</p>

  <p>In Nicaragua, it may not be necessary to do that. What is initially necessary is
  that the mass organizations, meeting in convention as a legislative body, invalidate
  any and all acts passed by the incoming bourgeois National Assembly. This first step
  lays the basis for reclaiming the legitimacy of both the state and the revolution.</p>

  <p>Of course, what is happening in Nicaragua represents a retreat by the revolutionary
  forces from what previously had been attained. Their concession to a bourgeois election
  constructed and carried out in accordance with bourgeois norms resulted in a
  capitalist-controlled National Assembly. Yet it is all shadow and no substance, since
  the actual power still rests with the People's Army and the complex of mass
  organizations.</p>

  <p>Should they be subordinated to this bourgeois, artificially constructed organ, whose
  origin and development are almost entirely the result of foreign imperialist
  intervention? Or should the revolutionary government, the de facto government as of
  now, reassert its authority, the authority of the revolution, which was won by the
  construction of the People's Army based on the peasants, the workers, and the multitude
  of organizations of the popular masses?</p>

  <p>Should they not do what experience and logic demand of them, do what was done in
  1917 and boldly assert their political authority, won as the result of the revolution,
  and dismiss this bogus parliament, this artificial construction of the imperialist
  bourgeoisie?</p>

  <p>That indeed would be throwing down the gauntlet to the imperialist masters abroad.
  Indeed, it seemed dangerous for the Bolsheviks to do that very thing. The soldiers were
  weary, facing death and destruction, the economy had been wrecked by the czarist
  autocracy. The bourgeoisie in the meantime thrived, as a result of inflation and
  economic havoc, and the masses were weary and had gone through incalculable suffering
  and untold casualties as a result of the war. What they wanted was peace, land and
  bread, which the Bolsheviks had promised.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Mensheviks, the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks threatened the
  peace. They feared more than anything else the combination of domestic
  counterrevolutionary reaction and foreign intervention. But the Bolsheviks felt there
  was no alternative to the seizure of power by the authentic masses of workers, soldiers
  and peasants except capitulation and surrender.</p>

  <p>Of course, there are differences between the situation in Nicaragua today and what
  took place in October 1917. Who can deny that? But aren't the similarities more
  fundamental, more germane, more relevant? Aren't the choices just as stark?</p>

  <h4>Still time</h4>

  <p>And now, look what is happening. According to the New York Times (March 13),
  President Daniel Ortega said, after a meeting in Chile with Dan Quayle, that the
  "transfer of power was going to take place with the utmost normality" and would "go
  forward with or without the contras."</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the imperialist bourgeoisie is strengthening its position. It is
  uttering sweet words of conciliation to the revolutionary government in Nicaragua, but
  at the same time it is strengthening the Chamorro clique. It has also imparted a new
  boldness to the counterrevolutionary riff-raff of mercenaries who are regarded by the
  Chamorro clique as the "heroes of the revolution," that is, the counterrevolution.</p>

  <p>Time is still on the side of the revolution. The options are admittedly narrow, but
  the course for saving the revolution is made clearer every day by the machinations of
  the imperialist bourgeoisie, which maintains a fraudulent conciliatory stance while at
  the same time strengthening wherever possible the counterrevolution headed by the
  Chamorro clique and supported by Washington, Wall Street and the Pentagon.</p>
