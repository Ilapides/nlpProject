  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: What lies ahead for the USSR (June 21, 1990)</title>

<body>
  <h1>What lies ahead for the USSR</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (June 21, 1990)</h5>

  <p>According to the ruling class press here, what has emerged in the Soviet Union under
  Gorbachev is chaos: ideological and political confusion, shortages of consumer goods, a
  loss of tempo in industrialization, a decline in the standard of living, stagflation,
  the growth of the black market, an increasing tendency towards enrichment of the few, a
  growing disillusionment of large sections of the population with Gorbachev and his
  reforms, and a growing inclination of the intellectuals, academicians, scientists and
  other elite to veer towards Western capitalism.</p>

  <p>All these, however, are merely the superficial manifestations of a far more profound
  phenomenon. It is the slow but gradual emergence of a polarization in the Soviet Union
  between two class camps, with the bourgeois, pro-capitalist elements on one side and
  the proletariat and its allies on the other. Almost squarely in the middle stands an
  increasingly discredited governing group, headed by Gorbachev.</p>

  <h4>Two class camps</h4>

  <p>Two class camps! But weren't the old ruling classes, the landlords and the
  bourgeoisie, abolished and liquidated long ago? Isn't the peasantry as it existed
  before the Revolution also gone? It was converted into a collectivized peasantry, even
  though collective property exists side by side with private plots, which continue to
  produce faster than the collectives.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the proletariat has developed mightily. Just before and after the
  Revolution it was a small minority of the population, which nevertheless was
  extraordinarily class conscious and receptive to the boldest revolutionary conclusions
  of Marxism. As long as it was led by a revolutionary Marxist party, it was capable of
  organizing society in the building of a new, progressive social order.</p>

  <p>Today the proletariat is not a minority of the population. It is the most numerous
  class in the Soviet Union. It is more educated. It is technologically and culturally
  decades and decades ahead of where it was in the early period of the Revolution.</p>

  <p>It has managed, under whatever leadership, to sustain the new social order in times
  of war and peace, of famine and purges, and of the threat of atomic annihilation posed
  by imperialist militarism, headed by the U.S. That's the proletariat of today.</p>

  <h4>New bourgeois layers</h4>

  <p>Nevertheless, despite the attempt at wholesale liquidation of the ruling bourgeois
  elements, there have grown up in the USSR over a period of decades new bourgeois layers
  which have been nurtured on the basis of economic as well as political exigencies. They
  have been showered with privilege, flattered for their abilities, and turned into an
  elitist phenomenon which stands above the proletariat. They have attained this position
  because of the conciliatory relationship shown toward them by the new governmental
  apparatus, which of necessity absorbed significant layers of the bureaucracy of the old
  regime.</p>

  <p>Particularly after the death of Lenin in 1924, the new bureaucracy needed to curb
  the new aggressiveness of the proletariat in its role, together with the peasantry, as
  the fundamental pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. Thus the bureaucracy took on a
  centrist stance.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, it needed to keep the proletariat in its place, so to speak. To do
  so, it had to curb the fundamental organs of workers' power, the Soviets, and to
  throttle workers' democracy there and, far more significantly, in the Party itself.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the bureaucracy relied on class elements hostile to socialism in
  the difficult task of industrialization as well as for scientific and technological
  advancement. These accommodated themselves to and indeed became servile instruments of
  the bureaucracy.</p>

  <h4>Bourgeois behavior under czarism</h4>

  <p>This role for the bourgeois elements is not unlike the way they conducted themselves
  much earlier, when capitalism was in its infancy. In general, the new bourgeois class
  growing up under feudalism at first accommodated itself to the needs of the feudal
  lords. In Russia, this meant ingratiating themselves with the czarist autocracy. They
  gained strength this way because czarism, in its struggle with more powerful capitalist
  rivals in Europe, needed the support first of merchant capital and later of industrial
  capital to assist its growing expansionist role in world affairs.</p>

  <p>The bigger the needs of the czarist autocracy in its struggle for a greater role
  abroad as well as against the workers and the peasants at home, the more it leaned on
  the bourgeoisie for support. Capitalism came to Russia late in the day, but its
  influence on the government grew until the czarist autocracy virtually became its
  captive. However, this in no way undermined the rule of the landlord class or weakened
  the autocratic reign of the czar and czarina themselves.</p>

  <p>In the writings of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in the <em>Communist
  Manifesto,</em> one can find a critical examination of how the bourgeoisie developed on
  a world scale from the 14th century on, how it started as an oppressed class under
  feudalism and rose to the dizzying heights of an oppressing ruling class.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>All this is significant in evaluating the growth of the bourgeois sector in the
  Soviet Union. The bourgeois elements have grown steadily and consistently in science,
  in technology, in the management of enterprises, in all areas where they have received
  enormous privileges and emoluments &mdash; particularly in the operation of the
  governmental apparatus by the bureaucracy itself.</p>

  <p>Purges here and there of both left- and right-wing elements in the Party during and
  after Stalin's rule have not resulted in the diminution of the influence of the
  bourgeois social stratum. Rather, it suffered least and accommodated itself to the
  needs of the successive governing groups after the death of Lenin.</p>

  <p>Just as the bourgeois elements found ways and means of not only coexisting with the
  feudal lords but of serving them while accumulating enormous strength and power, a
  similar if not identical process has taken place in the USSR.</p>

  <p>At a certain point, it is difficult to say exactly when, the challenge by the
  bourgeois elements grew more impudent and more open. Indeed, they were difficult to
  deal with during the entire course of development of the USSR, first because of the
  strategic needs in the early period, and later because of the conciliatory attitude of
  the bureaucratic apparatus arising out of its need to balance them against the
  proletariat. The proletariat, even though it had sunk into passivity and was deprived
  of any organs for independent class expression, was nevertheless becoming numerically
  ever stronger.</p>

  <h4>The Gorbachev generation</h4>

  <p>Everything came to a head and reached a crisis point with the passing of the
  so-called old guard &mdash; Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko. A new generation of
  leaders took over. Much of what then happened is attributed to the generation gap, but
  that explanation is insufficient. A new generation may usher in a revolutionary
  development or a reactionary one, depending upon the economic and political situation
  of the country.</p>

  <p>From the first day of taking over the administration of the government, the new
  generation ushered in by the likes of Gorbachev struck a conciliatory note toward
  Western imperialism. When Margaret Thatcher, the reactionary Conservative Prime
  Minister of Britain, recognized Gorbachev with her apparently off-hand remark, "I like
  him," it was no accident. The U.S. capitalist press seized upon it as a remarkable
  token that there would be new opportunities in the USSR.</p>

  <p>In its broad outlook, the Gorbachev grouping is different from the generation that
  grew up under Khrushchev, for example. Although Khrushchev has gone down in history as
  the principal revisionist after Stalin, his generation was nevertheless full of
  enthusiasm. It was an "up" generation that saw the technological and industrial growth
  of the USSR symbolized in the launching of Sputnik.</p>

  <p>Khrushchev himself challenged the U.S. to a race, not in armaments but in the living
  standards of the masses. He felt confident enough to boast about overtaking the U.S. on
  the basis of having an improved socialist economy and moving from what he called
  advanced socialism to communism.</p>

  <p>The Khrushchev generation received renewed strength from world revolutionary
  developments. Events in China, Korea, Vietnam, Cuba and throughout the colonial world
  gave the USSR revolutionary prestige and greater respect, even in the imperialist camp,
  notwithstanding the highly injurious split between China and the USSR which converted
  an ideological struggle into bourgeois nationalist rivalry.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev grouping is utterly unlike the Khrushchev one in this fundamental
  respect: rather than being eagerly competitive with imperialism, they have become
  eager-beaver conciliators and collaborators with it.</p>

  <p>The czarist court always had its anglophiles and francophiles. This generation is an
  updated version of them.</p>

  <p>Under the Leninist regime, the Bolsheviks had always promoted the idea of
  appropriating from the West whatever was necessary for the revolution and socialist
  construction. "Learn from them," Lenin was always saying, learn their skills and use
  them to develop our own social system. But it was all in the spirit of the communist
  struggle against capitalism.</p>

  <h4>Identifying with the vices of capitalism</h4>

  <p>This new generation of leaders, precisely because it is based upon a neobourgeois
  social grouping, identifies with the vices of capitalism rather than with its
  progressive aspects or its so-called virtues. It's a fundamental difference. They have
  become tantalized, one would say mesmerized, by the economic and technological
  successes of latter-day imperialism. They seem not to stop, even for a moment, to ask
  themselves how and by what means these successes have been achieved, or what the
  prospect of their duration is.</p>

  <p>Their leading economists have become free marketeers, a phrase which doesn't carry
  opprobrium among them but is rather a symbol of "innovative new thinking."</p>

  <p>This stratum which weeps so copiously at the brutal collectivization of the
  independent peasantry forget entirely that the free market has ruined the independent
  peasantry worldwide, has ousted them from the land. Millions have been reduced to
  beggary, or employment at any price. You only have to look at great megacities like Sao
  Paulo, Mexico City, Cairo and Calcutta to see what the free market does to the
  peasantry.</p>

  <p>And what about the peasants in old Russia who got uprooted from their ancient
  communes? Did they not form the great army for the industrialization begun by the
  bourgeoisie, when they weren't being used as cannon fodder?</p>

  <p>The new populists, as they are called today in the USSR, differ from West European
  romanticists and Russian Narodniki, who laid strong emphasis on the process by which
  the ancient communes were turned into capitalist agriculture. At least that older
  process had the merit that capitalist agriculture was superior to what Lenin called
  precapitalist agricultural stagnation.</p>

  <h4>After the summit, greater crises</h4>

  <p>Having polarized the country into virtually two class camps with its bourgeois,
  pro-capitalist reforms, the Gorbachev administration finds itself in even greater
  crisis after the summit meeting with Bush.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev's former ally, Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, who worked so long and hard
  on a new economic plan, presumably in cooperation with and at the behest of Gorbachev,
  now finds that it is unworkable. Moreover, the more bourgeois elements who previously
  supported him have now detached themselves from his plans and are moving to the extreme
  right, openly advocating pro-capitalist restorationist measures.</p>

  <p>Ryzhkov's plans involved tripling the price of bread and other basic commodities.
  They received such a hostile response from the broad public, particularly the working
  masses &mdash; imagine the price of bread being tripled! &mdash; that the extreme
  right, those openly for bourgeois restoration, decided to ditch Ryzhkov and play the
  role of demagogues by coming out against these harsh measures, of which they themselves
  had been the most enthusiastic supporters.</p>

  <p>How quickly, with such ease and facility, these novices in statecraft have learned
  bourgeois political trickery!</p>

  <p>Even before Gorbachev left for his summit meeting, Pravda interviewed two of these
  economists, one more extreme than the other in pushing the dismantling of the
  socialized industries. They are Academician S. S. Shatalin and a corresponding member
  of the Academy of Sciences, N. Ya. Petrakov.</p>

  <p>A condensed English text of the April 26 Pravda interview is available in the
  Current Digest of the Soviet Press, May 30, 1990, Vol. XLII, No. 17. An interview with
  Petrakov also appeared in the June 10 New York Times.</p>

  <p>It is to Petrakov that we draw the reader's attention, since he is the most
  outspoken of the neobourgeois restorationists. He is a personal adviser to Gorbachev,
  and his pronouncements seem to reflect not just a personal viewpoint, as he claims, but
  a grouping. It is quite easy for Gorbachev, or any head of state, to disavow a personal
  assistant. In this case, however, he has not seen fit to do so.</p>

  <h4>Petrakov: Dismantle socialized industries</h4>

  <p>In the first place, Petrakov completely repudiates the entire plan under which the
  Ryzhkov team has been operating. He calls for a swifter pace to virtually dismantle the
  socialized industries of the USSR and return them to capitalist control.</p>

  <p>That such a shocking proposal could be made in the USSR, and from none other than a
  member of Gorbachev's inner circle, is positively extraordinary. Could these assertions
  be made in all seriousness? Has the situation really gone that far? Have the outright
  bourgeois elements really gotten the upper hand within the councils of the government,
  and have they gotten the acquiescence if not the support of Gorbachev himself?</p>

  <p>Mind you, this comes immediately after Gorbachev returned from the summit virtually
  empty-handed. At this stage, he has received nothing from his many meetings with the
  chieftains of the U.S. ruling class, the so-called captains of industry whom he met in
  Minneapolis and on the West Coast, and the millionaire legislators in Washington.</p>

  <p>It is to be remembered that Petrakov is one of Gorbachev's inner circle. His role is
  akin to that of David Stockman, Reagan's director of the Office of Management and
  Budget, who in reality was the minion of the bankers and left to join Goldman Sachs at
  a six-figure salary.</p>

  <p>But let us proceed to examine at least the key proposals made by Petrakov. They are
  not just for the establishment of a free market and all that entails (a capitalist
  market economy). He gets down to more specific proposals.</p>

  <p>He calls for the conversion, or the denationalization, of state-owned industry by
  creating a stock market and selling the shares to the public. He even goes so far as to
  give the number of major state enterprises that could be converted to stock ownership
  in the next year: 2,200.</p>

  <h4>Democratic promises vs. dictatorial decrees</h4>

  <p>How does it work? The process is to begin with Gorbachev issuing decrees dismantling
  these industries and turning them over to private ownership. Note that this involves an
  extremely authoritarian, dictatorial measure. It is the exercise of personal
  dictatorship. Even Stalin never issued any decrees without first and foremost getting
  the support of the Politburo, Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet.</p>

  <p>Under this proposal, Gorbachev would use the emergency powers of the president that
  were established for such situations as floods, rebellions, or other extraordinary
  events which require immediate action. They have nothing to do with changing the form
  of the social system from a workers' state to a capitalist state. How undemocratic can
  they get? Yet this is passed off in silence as glasnost.</p>

  <p>The socialist enterprises will be converted to stock ownership. And just exactly how
  do you do a thing like that in a socialist country?</p>

  <h4>How stock ownership works</h4>

  <p>Let us suppose that the Magnetogorsk steel plant, which played an illustrious role
  in the Second World War and is now undergoing modernization, is to be converted to
  stock ownership. Who sets its price? Who knows the value? Do the directors set the
  value of the plant?</p>

  <p>Let us arbitrarily say it is worth 100 million rubles. If it is divided into a
  million shares, each would be worth 100 rubles. Who gets what? Let us say there are
  20,000 workers. Would each worker get 50 shares?</p>

  <p>Will the director of the Magnetogorsk complex really get the same number of shares
  as for instance a welder or pipefitter? Assuming that this is the case, which is highly
  improbable, the next question that arises is, can the workers convert their stock
  certificates into cash? Can they be bought and sold?</p>

  <p>The likelihood of that happening carries considerable danger. In the first place, if
  conversion into cash is done on a mass basis, it means the issuing of more currency,
  which in turn causes an inflationary spiral and devalues the Soviet currency.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the conversion into stock company certificates is done basically for
  the purpose not of selling them to the Soviet public but of floating them abroad in
  order to obtain foreign currency. This is what the Soviet bourgeois grouping wants
  most, to convert the plants into private property on the basis of individual stock
  ownership, letting the stock itself be floated abroad and bought up en masse by
  capitalists.</p>

  <p>Suppose this is done. What do these new rightwing bourgeois extremists have in mind
  next? They must know that you cannot float Soviet stock abroad without getting the
  mediation of the principal stock dealers, such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch in
  the U.S., as well as the British, the French and the German bankers. It is impossible
  to float any stock without making them the intermediaries.</p>

  <p>As part and parcel of appeasing the Bourse, Lombard Street, and especially Wall
  Street, the Soviet leaders agreed at the summit to pay up on the Lend Lease from the
  Second World War. Until now, the Soviet government has consistently refused to do this,
  and for good reason. Its loss of soldiers, civilians and material goods during the
  struggle that broke the back of Hitler's armies was enormous, way out of proportion to
  anything suffered by the imperialist Allies. Why should it owe them anything?</p>

  <h4>Penetration of imperialist banks</h4>

  <p>The imperialist banks, of course, will not float the stock unless they in turn get
  an opportunity to ``examine'' the enterprises (a euphemism for having some control over
  the companies whose stock is being floated). And this directly brings the banks into
  the internal affairs of the economic situation in the USSR. It brings to the fore the
  possibility of imperialist penetration of Soviet industry.</p>

  <p>Petrakov calls for the establishment of a free market, an independent banking system
  (independent of whom?), increased interest rates and the selling of government
  land.</p>

  <p>It is ideas like this which instigated the recent violent struggle between the Uzbek
  and Kirghiz people. Why? Because the government began talking about putting up land,
  especially land on the borders of the two republics, for sale.</p>

  <p>Petrakov's proposals mean becoming integrated and subordinated to the world
  capitalist market. The word "free" market is a fraud. It actually means dependence upon
  the world market, which in turn means world imperialist finance capital, headed by the
  U.S. You cannot get into the world capitalist market, especially in a serious way,
  without the bankers having what they call oversight of the companies whose stocks are
  being floated.</p>

  <p>If stock merely remains as paper in the hands of the workers, or is redeemable in
  Soviet currency only, then it is a form of cooperative ownership. But stock ownership
  has no significance unless the stocks can be bought and sold. And the buyers are in the
  world capitalist market, because the internal market is very limited. Once it becomes
  part of the world market, it fluctuates in price and is subject to the disturbances of
  the world capitalist market. And the world market is under the hegemony of monopoly
  finance capital.</p>

  <p>Thus the conversion of state-owned property, particularly the huge enterprises, to
  stock ownership means the subordination of the Soviet economy to the world capitalist
  market.</p>

  <h4>Examples of Hungary and Poland</h4>

  <p>If these people need any example as to how this works, they can look at Hungary or
  Poland. Wherever there has been a conversion from state to private ownership,
  especially in the important industrial sectors, the so-called oversight by the big
  banks constitutes a formidable form of penetration of imperialist finance capital,
  which dictates how the industry should be run. This has caused havoc for the workers,
  hundreds of thousands of whom have been laid off, while at the same time inflationary
  pressures depress the living standards of the masses.</p>

  <p>All the progress the Soviet Union has made technologically and scientifically in
  developing the country has been on the basis of limited intervention in the world
  capitalist market and limited effects on the Soviet domestic scene. If this situation
  is reversed, the imperialist monopolies will have the upper hand.</p>

  <p>Before launching upon this adventurist scheme of converting socialized industry into
  joint stock companies, this grouping which is fearful of the masses, knowing how much
  they hate the thought of returning to capitalism, nevertheless invited none other than
  the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, to Moscow to consult
  with him. To learn the mechanics of capitalist banking? No, the USSR has a world of
  experience in this. And any junior executive of a big bank or graduate of a U.S.
  business school can give them a comprehensive exposition on it.</p>

  <p>What they wanted was to get his blessings, his assurance that the big banks he
  represents would look favorably upon the idea of the Soviet Union floating stock in the
  world capitalist market.</p>

  <p>Will obtaining a new market for exploitation give the capitalist system a new lease
  on life? Not at all. On the contrary, this flotation of securities, even with the help
  of imperialist banks, comes at a time when there's a glut in the worldwide securities
  market. The collapse of 1987 was a harbinger of what awaits the world capitalist
  market. And if the USSR is a part of it, it will suffer as much if not more than the
  capitalist countries.</p>

  <p>If an empire like that of Donald Trump, just to take a current example, faces the
  possibility of collapse, then what can happen to plants like Magnetogorsk and
  others?</p>

  <p>Petrakov also wants to legalize private shops to sell caviar, etc. This is so
  patently calculated to aid the bourgeois elements that it was killed, significantly
  enough, by the official trade unions, which are again showing some opposition to the
  government.</p>

  <p>Of course, Petrakov's proposals are only in the planning stage. But some inroads
  have already gone into effect.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev opens economy to CIA</h4>

  <p>Glasnost of course has its progressive side insofar as it enables the working class
  to raise its own voice (which has yet to happen in a political sense). But it has also
  meant that hordes of scholars, academicians, technicians, engineers, and above all CIA
  spies have had an open door to the workings of the Soviet economy and its institutions.
  They have intensified their activities in the USSR, particularly in the most strategic
  field &mdash; the economy.</p>

  <p>Does the CIA announce itself? When it gave the names and positions of Indonesian
  progressives to the military in 1965 in order to destroy the Indonesian Communist
  Party, did it come with a signpost, "Here is the CIA"? Now they're in the USSR,
  promoting the capitalist market, giving publicity to their favorite economists, and
  laying the basis for a bloody civil war like in Indonesia which will inevitably arise
  between the two class camps as soon as the capitalist reforms take hold and become
  familiar to the masses.</p>

  <p>For the new bourgeois elements to undo 70 years of life and labor, it will take a
  lot more than mere tinkering with the currency, causing a breakdown in the monopoly of
  foreign trade, sabotaging the flow of consumer goods, or hoarding significant
  commodities used in the daily life of the people in order to discredit socialist
  planning.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev regime veers from right to left, but its general orientation is to
  further deepen the capitalist reforms so as to gain entry into the circle of the
  industrial imperialist powers.</p>

  <p>Bourgeois economists like Petrakov think that the easiest route to take is to obtain
  capital from abroad, meaning loans from the U.S. and other imperialist countries. They
  hope to avoid instituting the drastic austerity measures that are immediately required
  if the so-called transition period from a socialized economy to a capitalist economy is
  to be shortened. The truth of the matter is that they are fearful the masses will
  oppose them and open up the era of struggle between the working class and the new
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>In the middle is the bureaucracy. Some veer towards supporting an independent
  workers' struggle. Some are trying to find individual niches among the bourgeoisie. And
  others seem totally confounded, never having believed that the reforms would so
  adversely affect the living standards of the masses.</p>

  <h4>Class struggle ahead</h4>

  <p>The reforms are mired down, not because of resistance emanating from the
  bureaucratic apparatus as such, but because of fear that the masses will resist and
  open up a nationwide struggle. In fact, this is precisely what lies ahead.</p>

  <p>It is impossible for the Gorbachev regime to continue with its halfway-to-capitalism
  measures which have brought neither the modernization of industry that was promised nor
  a brief dislocation followed by an improvement in the supply of goods. The masses are
  beginning to understand that the prospects are for the mass dismantling of the
  socialized economy with long-term unemployment and soaring prices.</p>

  <p>The choice is: either go forward with an improved, more democratic socialist
  planning, free of rigidity, dogmatism, and hierarchical tenure in office, opening the
  doors wide to the participation of the masses, enlisting their creative energies, their
  innovative ideas; or face the possibility of the havoc and misery to be caused by the
  full reintroduction of capitalism. All of this persuades us that the struggle in the
  USSR between the capitalist roaders and the working class is just beginning. Capitalism
  as a social system cannot be sneaked into the USSR by fraudulent, imperialist stooges
  from the managerial, academic and technical aristocracy and the corrupt bureaucratic
  administrative groupings. They will have to fight it out with weapons in hand and not
  by sleight of hand.</p>

  <p>Such is the real prospect in the USSR today.</p>
