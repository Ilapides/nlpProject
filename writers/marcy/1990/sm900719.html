  <h1>Problems of the 28th Party Congress</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (July 19, 1990)</h5>

  <p>July 10 &mdash; In one of his last speeches to the Russian Communist Party, Lenin
  described the problems of the New Economic Policy (NEP) in the following words:</p>

  <p>``Well, we have lived through a year, the state is in our hands; but has it operated
  the New Economic Policy in the way we wanted in this past year? No. But we refuse to
  admit that it did not operate in the way we wanted. How did it operate? The machine
  refused to obey the hand that guided it. It was like a car that was going not in the
  direction the driver desired, but in the direction someone else desired; as if it were
  being driven by some mysterious, lawless hand, God knows whose, perhaps of a profiteer,
  or of a private capitalist, or of both.'' (V.I. Lenin, Political Report of the Central
  Committee to the 11th Congress of the Russian Communist Party, March 27, 1922,
  <em>Collected Works,</em> Vol. 33, p. 279.)</p>

  <p>There is all of Leninism in this remarkable quote. It illustrates the essence of
  Marxist methodology in relation to strategy and tactics. It is both critical and
  revolutionary, which is the essence of the Marxist approach.</p>

  <p>Compare this to what is happening now in the USSR. Gorbachev's anti-socialist
  reforms have increased the economic and political problems by tenfold, maybe even a
  hundredfold. Yet Gorbachev, almost five years into his administration, throws the
  complete responsibility for the failure of his reforms on the Party, and carefully
  excludes himself from the process.</p>

  <p>Lenin conceived of the NEP, which allowed the capitalist market to function in the
  USSR for a few years in the early 1920s, as a necessary strategic retreat. Eventually
  it had to be abandoned. The Gorbachev bourgeois reformist grouping, however, consider
  their oversized, gargantuan NEP as nothing less than a momentous, revolutionary
  development.</p>

  <p>The hopes raised by it were fantastic; the enthusiasm it generated in the early
  months of his administration was overwhelming. But this soon began to wane as
  experience showed the masses that it was not a better, easier life they faced but a
  more difficult one.</p>

  <h4>Party delegates opposed to reforms</h4>

  <p>It is not surprising, then, that at the 28th Congress of the Communist Party of the
  Soviet Union (CPSU) now winding up, the overwhelming majority of the delegates have
  shown they are opposed to the reforms (as virtually all the bourgeois press have
  admitted). But they have gotten themselves into a straitjacket. In the first place,
  they voted for the reforms at the 27th Congress. This is an embarrassment, of course,
  but one which took place more than four and a half years ago.</p>

  <p>Let it be said in some defense of the delegates that at that time the reforms
  appeared to be mild. They were heavily disguised; the greatest emphasis was put on the
  scientific and technological aspects of Gorbachev's restructuring scheme. Overlooked
  completely, and perhaps not well understood by the mass of Communists themselves, were
  references to changes in the social relations. In Marxist terminology, of course,
  changes in social relations generally mean changes between the classes, between the
  bourgeoisie, the proletariat and the petit bourgeoisie. But this was not discussed.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov opened a violent attack on so-called
  "levelers" in the working class movement. That should have been a signal as to where
  the burden of the reforms would fall. The Levelers in English history were early
  communists who fought against the rising bourgeoisie and the rich. They were accused of
  wanting to bring the rich down to the level of the peasantry and the yeomanry, the poor
  rural population. Actually, their program was understood by the peasants as the
  expropriation of the landlords.</p>

  <p>But accusations against "levelers" in the USSR have always been directed against the
  workers who are opposed to the privileges of the bureaucracy, especially in the trade
  union movement. Their struggle is in reality not an attempt to level down higher-paid
  workers but to raise their own wage rates and cut down the privileges of the
  bureaucratic apparatus.</p>

  <h4>Perestroika increasingly unpopular</h4>

  <p>When Gorbachev first proposed his restructuring program, the delegates voted for it
  unanimously. If there was any dissent at that time, it was not revealed.</p>

  <p>However, it didn't take long for Gorbachev and his grouping to start full speed
  ahead with efforts to break up the collective farms by introducing private property
  conceptions such as 25- and 50-year leaseholds, idealizing family-owned farms, and
  cutting down on the modernization of agriculture.</p>

  <p>In industry, restructuring has meant unemployment. What was called ``greater
  autonomy'' for the enterprises introduced a form of bourgeois competition, which on the
  one hand produces the hoarding of vital commodities and on the other hand a superfluity
  of those goods which are socially unneeded.</p>

  <p>The ills in the consumer field have become so enormous that the general population
  is losing patience altogether with the reforms and the government. Strikes have become
  frequent. Where workers like the miners have won concessions, the gains are mostly on
  paper. Their demands have really not been addressed, leaving the leadership a prey to
  "Solidarity"-type, "independent" trade unions.</p>

  <h4>Party leaders fear a split</h4>

  <p>This Party congress showed that while most of the delegates are opposed to the
  reforms as a setback for socialism, they nevertheless have no program of their own to
  counterpose to the anti-socialist measures. Some, still a minority, believe the process
  has gone too far, and simply don't know how or whether it is possible to return to the
  old status quo.</p>

  <p><strong>The majority, however, are fearful that an up-and-down opposition to the
  Gorbachev leadership would create a split and raise the specter of civil war. That's
  the crux of the matter.</strong></p>

  <p>At the same time, perestroika, like the NEP with its privateers and capitalists, is
  like a car that doesn't go in the direction the driver desires. In fact, it is in a
  ditch. The question the Party Congress faced was how to get out of it. To date, it has
  given no answer.</p>

  <p>For that reason the progressives have been unable to call upon the mass of the
  workers and the peasants, who are opposed to the chaos, confusion, and virtual
  destruction of much of what they have gained in these many years of struggle.</p>

  <p>The social composition of the Party must also be kept in mind. Progressive though it
  may be in its overwhelming majority, it is not the Party of the proletariat as it was
  in Lenin's time; it is merely a shadow of that. Nevertheless, it has enormous potential
  significance.</p>

  <p>All over the imperialist world, Gorbachev has been portrayed as the peerless
  proponent of democratization. If he stands for anything, we are told again and again,
  it is <em>glasnost,</em> openness, and the encouragement of discussion and debate.</p>

  <h4>Need for real discussion</h4>

  <p>How can anyone in this day and age be opposed to that? Encouragement of debate and
  discussion, above all in the congress of the Communist Party, has been lacking ever
  since the Leninist period. Hence, a congress of the Party where real discussion takes
  place is something that should be welcome, and not throttled. One would expect that the
  general secretary of the Party would be most on guard to see that this is observed.</p>

  <p>Here then is the paradox. At this congress, the delegates moved to question each of
  the leaders responsible for different areas, most of them cabinet members. They wanted
  a direct accounting from them on all the burning questions of the day. But Gorbachev
  throttled off the discussion.</p>

  <p>The last congress took place in February 1986, more than four years ago. Gorbachev
  had become general secretary early in 1985. So a considerable period has elapsed, one
  that is rich in developments of a worldwide character, one that has had the deepest and
  most profound effects on the working classes and oppressed peoples everywhere,
  especially in Eastern Europe &mdash; the doorstep of the Soviet Union. The general
  secretary and all the leading members of the Politburo, who hold responsible positions
  in the government as well, should have given a full report.</p>

  <p>The Communist Party is at least nominally the governing party. Not only should the
  leadership have reported on the operation of the government and the general situation
  in the country, but also room had to be left open for questioning of the reporters.</p>

  <p>It is not only the right of the delegates, but their duty, to subject the principal
  reporters, including the general secretary, to searching questions &mdash; especially
  if one considers the crisis in the country and the decline in the world position of the
  USSR.</p>

  <p>The congress delegates made a motion to interrogate the leading Politburo members
  who have held responsible positions in the government. Such leaders in the government
  as Shevardnadze, Yakovlev, Medvedev, Ligachev, Abalkin, and others were submitted to
  questioning. And what happened?</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev cuts off questioning</h4>

  <p>It became plain &mdash; and this is reported in the press everywhere in the world
  &mdash; that at the moment when the questioning became too inconvenient for the general
  secretary, he ended the process with a brutal threat to split the congress if it was
  not halted.</p>

  <p>The questioning by the progressive opposition (dubbed "conservatives" by the
  bourgeois press) had aroused the ire of Gorbachev, and especially of the so-called
  Democratic Platform grouping, which is outlandishly bourgeois and pro-imperialist, and
  should have no place in a communist, or even socialist, organization.</p>

  <p>All the capitalist newspapers of July 8 and 9 reported this. And there is no denial
  from the Gorbachev leadership.</p>

  <p>Since the days of 1848 when the first communist organizations were formed, just
  raising the question of a split in the party has constituted a threat. Whoever uses
  this provocative phraseology is in reality attempting to throw the onus on the other
  side, while at the same time threatening to split. The history of Bolshevism since 1903
  is full of discussions of that character.</p>

  <p>Anyone who, in the course of a discussion, says what Gorbachev said to the delegates
  to the congress ("If you continue this course of questioning you will bury the Party,
  you will split it") in reality is the one threatening to split.</p>

  <p>This shouldn't come as a surprise, since on a number of occasions he has hinted to
  the capitalist press that he may leave the post of general secretary. Nevertheless,
  it's worth while examining the propriety of the general secretary of the Party
  attempting to cut off debate at such a crucial time in the history of the Party and of
  the country. This in itself is a spectacle.</p>

  <p>After all, he and his leading Politburo members are what amounts in a bourgeois
  government to top leaders of the cabinet. They are duty-bound not only to make full
  reports but to be thoroughly <strong>examined</strong> by the congress delegates. That
  would be real socialist democracy! It would be refreshing were it to prevail at this
  very critical period in Soviet history.</p>

  <p>So why did he cut it off? Why should the delegates not question the government?</p>

  <h4>Right to question the government</h4>

  <p>This right to question the government has a long and ancient tradition. The
  bourgeoisie in its struggle against the royal power, after having won the concession of
  a parliament, then demanded that the parliament have the right to submit what were
  called "interrogatories," that is, written questions, to the king's ministers. And they
  were required to respond to them. That, you recall, happened several centuries ago.</p>

  <p>So here we have the peerless leader of democratization virtually threatening to
  break up the congress unless they cease interrogating his ministers! Democratization,
  it seems, is most readily available when it is needed by the new bourgeois stratum in
  the Soviet Union, represented by the Democratic Platform, but it fades away when those
  who espouse the resumption of socialist construction want to exercise it.</p>

  <p>What is forgotten by the congress leaders is that Gorbachev himself is afraid of
  leaving the Party, precisely because the bourgeois elements in the Congress of People's
  Deputies, which predominate in that body, will either make him a complete prisoner of
  their restorationist positions, or find a way to get rid of him. So under the present
  circumstances Gorbachev prefers to have a leg in each of the two camps: the camp of the
  Party and the camp of the Congress of People's Deputies. Such a situation may be
  tenable for a period of time. That depends not on parliamentary maneuvers, but upon the
  objective situation in the country &mdash; the course of the economy.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev seeks help from imperialists</h4>

  <p>It is precisely this factor, the economic factor, which is becoming daily more
  acute. The economic situation is such that Gorbachev and his lieutenants are virtually
  begging the imperialist powers to help them economically and financially. It is no
  wonder, then, that not only the Federal Republic of (West) Germany, but all the
  imperialist countries (except the U.S.) are now willing to extend loans and credits,
  <strong>provided that the USSR permits the imperialist powers to have the kind of say
  in Soviet domestic affairs which they generally have in the oppressed, neo-colonialist
  countries.</strong> This becomes plainer every day.</p>

  <p>There are many things that could be asked of the Party leadership. For example, what
  was the substance of Eduard Shevardnadze's conversations with Secretary of State James
  Baker at the latter's hideout in Wyoming? Were Cuba and Nicaragua discussed? Were
  Ethiopia and the DPRK topics? Did they discuss the swallowing up of the GDR by
  imperialist West Germany? The reduction of support for or abandonment of socialist
  allies, especially in the Third World? What did Baker demand? What in fact has the USSR
  got as a result of all the peace-loving conversations that have taken place over the
  years?</p>

  <p>One might also ask questions of Leonid Abalkin, Gorbachev's close economic adviser
  whose constant promotion of all types of capitalist schemes has made him notorious. For
  instance, why was it necessary to invite to Moscow the chairman of the Federal Reserve
  Bank of the U.S., Alan Greenspan, a far-right exponent of capitalist expansion and
  imperialist aggression? What was the real substance of these conversations? Did the
  meeting pertain to loans from the U.S., trade, or so-called aid? The bourgeois press is
  reporting frantic appeals for loans. Is that what the Greenspan visit was all
  about?</p>

  <p>The questioning by so many delegates made it clear that the overwhelming majority of
  the progressives are now opposed to the Gorbachev program. What this means, and this
  has to be stressed, is that Gorbachev has lost his fundamental social and political
  support in the country. The Communist Party was his principal supporter, even though it
  is only a shadow of the workers' organization it once was. It nevertheless still
  retains that significance. The fact that he maneuvered to enlarge the Politburo by
  adding a representative from each of the 15 republics does not change the overall
  character of the struggle. It is merely a maneuver, an exercise in state craft. It does
  not invalidate that he has lost the class support of the only mass organization which
  at least nominally is for communism.</p>

  <p>He has moved further into the camp of the Congress of People's Deputies, where the
  bourgeois elements predominate. His support there may turn out to be purely ephemeral.
  Ultimately, the whole situation will reduce itself to what has already been emerging
  for a considerable period: two class camps. It's a unique form of dual power. On the
  one hand is the bourgeois Soviet of People's Deputies; on the other the Communist
  Party, a shadow of its former self but nevertheless potentially an enormous factor
  depending on its internal evolution in the struggle.</p>

  <h4>Embryonic dual power</h4>

  <p>It is very true that the dual form of power is only embryonic at this stage, but it
  is nevertheless significant. The bourgeoisie at the present time needs Gorbachev in
  order to hold the CP in line. The CP centrist leadership, on the other hand, is fearful
  of unleashing a principled attack against Gorbachev's anti-socialist and bourgeois
  restorationist reforms. It lacks the initiative and boldness to call upon the masses in
  the struggle against the bourgeois reforms.</p>

  <p>The very fact that this congress, unlike the previous one, is opposed to the reforms
  is testimony to the resistance that is already evident in the mass movement of the
  working class. At this moment, it doesn't matter very much which leaders exercise
  influence over the mass organizations of the workers, such as the trade unions, the
  miners in particular, some of whom have been captured by the political apparatus of the
  bourgeois elements. It won't last. What the miners really want and badly need is not
  what the bourgeoisie will offer them. On the contrary.</p>

  <p>But the CP leaders do not see the urgency of identifying with the workers'
  resistance and urging a struggle. They thus remain in a paralyzed position.</p>

  <p>The Gorbachev reformers who control the economy are likewise unable to push through
  their reforms &mdash; the dismantling and vandalizing of socialist industry &mdash;
  because they too, even more so, are fearful of provoking a civil war. It's not for
  nothing that the specter of a military coup has been raised again and again. But as we
  have pointed out earlier, the Soviet military has no tradition of involving itself
  politically in a military coup. Many are strong supporters of the progressives at this
  congress. The imperialist press has had to grudgingly admit this. But at this point the
  situation remains somewhat of a stalemate.</p>

  <p>Hence, the frantic appeals by the anti-socialist reformers to the imperialist
  bourgeoisie to help them.</p>

  <p>The latter, on the other hand, while full of praise and flattery for Gorbachev and
  his colleagues, are nevertheless extremely cautious when it comes to direct, meaningful
  assistance to the economy. What Bush wants to do is send more and more personnel,
  technicians, who in fact will be CIA agents in disguise.</p>

  <h4>Expansion of Politburo</h4>

  <p>Gorbachev's move to expand the Politburo and add the Party leaders from each of the
  15 major republics is a poorly veiled attempt to win back the confidence of the
  nationalities in Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Central Asian Republics
  and elsewhere. In this he will not succeed. The hostility of the nationalities to
  Gorbachev will in no way be mitigated, since the problems of the nationalities cannot
  be solved merely by this threadbare maneuver. In form, these additions appear to be a
  move toward greater democracy. But in essence Gorbachev will retain the leadership
  through his Presidential Council of cabinet-level appointed administrators.</p>

  <p>In his last letters on "autonomization," Lenin stressed not autonomy for the
  republics, which was Stalin's formulation, but to make each of the republics
  <strong>equal</strong> with the others within a socialist union, not just in form but
  in essence. The neglect of the underdeveloped republics, the gross economic inequality
  which still exists among them is what had to be addressed when Gorbachev took over. But
  he has done nothing about this. Rather, his anti-socialist policies have exacerbated
  the inequalities. This piddling concession of getting the Party heads of each of the
  republics on the Politburo is long, long overdue, since his Politburo until now has
  been composed almost entirely of Russians.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev's re-election</h4>

  <p>Gorbachev's re-election as general secretary does not signify the tremendous victory
  that the imperialist press claims. It merely demonstrates the paralysis of the congress
  delegates and their inability to deal adequately with the Gorbachev leadership. They
  were thoroughly unprepared to present a slate of their own leaders, including a
  candidate for general secretary.</p>

  <p>If the voting for the leadership, as we understand it on the basis of present press
  reports, was based on the secret ballot, then this was a violation by the delegates of
  their responsibility toward their constituency. The membership is entitled to know who
  they supported, and why they didn't present their own slate, since the issues are of a
  programmatic and principled character, and not a matter of personal qualifications
  where a secret ballot might be appropriate.</p>

  <p>Gorbachev's re-election may be important from the point of view of power politics,
  but it doesn't change the correlation of class forces; the classes are becoming more
  polarized. His re-election will prove to be no more than a sleight of hand of political
  craftsmanship which cannot and will not change the economic situation.</p>

  <p>As the economic situation becomes more acute, the resistance from the working class
  is bound to break out into the open. And this time it will not be in defense of the
  bourgeois reforms, as it was in the earlier period, but against them and from the
  viewpoint and interests of the working class, the peasantry, and the progressive
  intelligentsia.</p>
