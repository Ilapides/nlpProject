  <h1>The Socialist Scholars Conference</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (April 19, 1990)</h5>

  <p>For a Marxist, the initial point of all social analysis is always the class
  criterion. What classes, what social groupings are involved? The politics of a
  particular grouping must always be regarded from the viewpoint of which class it
  represents. Politics, Marxism has taught, is concentrated economics. Unless we go
  behind the politics and look at the economic anatomy of society, which is divided into
  classes, any clear social analysis is impossible.</p>

  <p>From the earliest beginnings of the socialist movement in every country, the class
  question has always been central. That is because the proletariat can only be liberated
  if it puts forth, clearly and unequivocally, its own program as distinct from that of
  the capitalists, who are concerned only with predatory exploitation and imperialist
  oppression. The proletariat has everything to gain and nothing to lose by openly and
  clearly speaking in its own name, for its own class ends.</p>

  <p>The most advanced section of the workers and the most brilliant intellectual minds
  learned from the French Revolution that the glittering slogans of freedom, equality and
  fraternity were calculated to secure and promote the interests of the bourgeoisie as
  against the class interests of the workers and poor peasants. It was on the basis of
  this great lesson, among others, that Marx and Engels were able to elucidate the class
  struggle raging in capitalist society and to describe in detail why and how the
  proletariat must state openly and clearly its own objectives, the liberation of the
  proletariat from its principal antagonist, the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Nothing so much symbolizes the objective of the proletariat as the succinct slogan
  of the <em>Communist Manifesto,</em> still heard around the world: "Workers of the
  world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains."</p>

  <p>But the bourgeoisie has a whole lot to lose by stating its aims unequivocally, let
  alone spelling out specifically what its aims and ends are. It must forever conceal
  them so that the workers will be blinded.</p>

  <p>To do this, it is urgent that it have all sorts of intermediaries, especially from
  the petit bourgeoisie and its intellectual representatives, to blur and conceal the
  naked, brutal struggle that goes on between the two basic classes in contemporary
  society.</p>

  <h4>Social democrats and Eastern Europe</h4>

  <p>We have in mind a variety of social and political groupings which have concerned
  themselves for a long period of time with developments in what was the socialist camp.
  Few of them have been louder or more articulate as cheerleaders for freedom from
  Stalinist rule than the social democrats. They have joined with the imperialists in
  welcoming the great upheavals in Eastern Europe now referred to as revolutions.</p>

  <p>For a long, long time the social democrats and their leftist supporters regarded
  this as the sine qua non for liberation, never once noticing that the bourgeoisie on a
  world scale was pushing the same slogans even more loudly and effectively.</p>

  <p>Considering the magnitude of these events, we Marxists must first of all ask, what
  is the class character of these upheavals? What classes are the driving forces behind
  them?</p>

  <p>We know what the class character of the French Revolution was. Notwithstanding the
  glittering slogans, it was a bourgeois revolution, as all now agree.</p>

  <p>Or, take what in the United States is known as the war between the states, the Civil
  War. It is often properly called a revolution. The driving forces in that struggle were
  the class of slave owners on one side and the rising Northern bourgeoisie on the other.
  It was a class struggle, a struggle between two diametrically opposed social systems
  for hegemony in the hemisphere. The Northern industrial bourgeoisie found it absolutely
  indispensable to make the abolition of chattel slavery a principal objective in its
  struggle for domination over the United States.</p>

  <p>Of course, even today the imperialist bourgeoisie minimizes the tremendous and
  indispensable slave insurrections that had been going on for centuries. Nevertheless,
  Marxists recognize that the war was a bourgeois revolution. Few serious historians have
  denied its class character. True, it was highly democratic and progressive, but its
  class content was the supremacy of the bourgeoisie over the chattel slave owners.</p>

  <p>What was the class character of the February Revolution in Russia in 1917? Of the
  October Revolution? In both cases, workers and peasants participated. But what was the
  objective significance of these two revolutions?</p>

  <p>Marxists characterize February as a bourgeois revolution, even though some of its
  results were highly democratic. Had the proletarian revolution not intervened, that
  struggle would have firmly entrenched the bourgeoisie, which would have continued its
  exploitation and oppression of the workers and peasants and prosecuted the imperialist
  war.</p>

  <p>The October Revolution, on the other hand, is properly called a proletarian
  revolution. It was a revolution of the workers and peasants against the bourgeoisie.
  Its class content was unique and unprecedented at that time, with the sole exception of
  the Paris Commune of 1871.</p>

  <p>The new workers' government broke with imperialism, made a clarion call for
  worldwide proletarian revolution, sounded the tocsin in the struggle of the oppressed
  people against imperialism, and created a new international organization to succeed the
  First and Second Internationals so as to revive and promote the world socialist
  revolution.</p>

  <p>Coming back to the great social transformations in Eastern Europe, we must ask
  ourselves, what is their class character?</p>

  <p>What is the class character of the transformations in Poland, Hungary and Romania,
  for example? The fact that workers may be involved in them is not decisive. Scarcely
  anything of great significance in modern times is done without involving great masses
  of the population.</p>

  <h4>What is class character of upheavals?</h4>

  <p>Sometimes large masses can be involved in counterrevolutionary actions, such as the
  destruction of the Paris Commune. The bourgeoisie draws the workers into involvement in
  imperialist wars and interventions. Workers and peasants are often used as mere cannon
  fodder to support imperialist profits. Are these not facts of history?</p>

  <p>A forum held recently by the Socialist Scholars Conference was expected by many to
  address this burning question on the class character of the upheavals in Eastern
  Europe. There is scarcely a more significant world problem for socialists.</p>

  <p>But that's the one thing they all avoided. They failed to call this most important
  phenomenon by its class denomination. Is the so-called revolution in Hungary a
  proletarian revolution because many workers participated in it, or is it a bourgeois,
  pro-imperialist revolution, a counterrevolution, as a Marxist would call it? Is the
  transformation in Romania a proletarian revolution, or is it a bourgeois
  counterrevolution? On this the socialist scholars are mum.</p>

  <h4>The umbrella of anti-Stalinism</h4>

  <p>Instead of proceeding according to the norms of Marxist analysis, they have instead
  adopted an all-embracing definition, an umbrella, which suits the bourgeoisie
  perfectly. It is dinned into our ears day and night, by the bourgeoisie first and
  foremost, that these revolutions are anti-Stalinist. Period.</p>

  <p>But Stalinism is a <strong>political</strong> phenomenon which needs
  <strong>class</strong> analysis and elaboration. Can the socialist scholars deny that
  it is a political phenomenon and must be reflective of whatever classes exist in the
  Soviet Union, as well as the USSR's relation to the world struggle, particularly the
  struggle of imperialism against the socialist countries?</p>

  <p>Let us go back to when the term Stalinist originated, following the death of Lenin.
  At that time there were three political tendencies within the Soviet Communist Party
  and the international communist movement. The first, the Bukharin-Rykov-Tomsky
  tendency, was regarded, at least by the left and center, as a right deviation. Leading
  the Left Opposition were Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev. The center, having control of
  the party apparatus and the dominant tendency at the time, was headed by Stalin.</p>

  <p><strong>Thus the anti-Stalin struggle at that time was one between political
  tendencies within the communist movement and for communist objectives.</strong></p>

  <p>The term Stalinism was understood as meaning Stalin's false measures in regard to
  collectivization, privileges for the upper stratum in Soviet society, and repressive
  measures within the party to stifle democratic centralist opposition. The
  anti-Stalinists were communists who were opposed to Stalin's policies, from both the
  right and the left. Stalinism referred to policies which were considered regressive in
  relation to the objectives of the world proletarian revolution and the construction of
  socialism at home.</p>

  <p>Over a period of years, however, the world bourgeoisie intervened slowly but
  consistently in this struggle and began to convert the progressive anti-Stalin struggle
  within the communist movement into a struggle against communism altogether. This was a
  decisive turn of world historic significance. During the Cold War especially, the term
  Stalinism was used in such a way that hardly anyone could distinguish between a
  progressive struggle against Stalin from the viewpoint of the working class and a
  bourgeois, flagrantly pro-imperialist attack.</p>

  <p>Thus a Sakharov, a Solzhenitsyn, a Sharansky all came to be in the camp of
  "anti-Stalinism," although they were thoroughly bourgeois, counterrevolutionary and
  pro-imperialist. To champion their cause is to champion the cause of the imperialist
  bourgeoisie. Yet hardly any among the so-called left anti-Stalinists would utter so
  much as a word to indicate a difference in social or class objectives with these agents
  of imperialism. All were under this great, all-embracing democratic umbrella.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie placed its class interests under this umbrella and gradually
  absorbed all the other groupings. Most significant and sometimes most fervent in the
  anti-Stalin camp were the social democrats, their left wing most of all.</p>

  <h4>Social democrats on revolutionary violence</h4>

  <p>During the early twenties, after the Bolshevik Revolution, the social democrats
  clearly demarcated themselves from the communists in their opposition to the use of
  violence in the seizure of power to overthrow the bourgeoisie. Just as important to the
  bourgeoisie were their proclamations that their attachment to bourgeois democratic
  procedures was absolute and undeviating.</p>

  <p>This demarcation between the social democrats and the communists is important in
  relation to Eastern Europe as well as the USSR, for both abstract, absolutist democracy
  and nonviolence clearly serve the ends of the bourgeoisie. There never has taken place
  peacefully a thoroughgoing socialist revolution where the workers and peasants took
  over the means of production and expropriated the lands and property of the
  bourgeoisie. Such a revolution requires the seizure of power by the workers and
  peasants and defense against the violent opposition of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Finally, it requires the broadest participation of the masses in order to break up
  the violent state apparatus of the ruling class and replace it with one that serves the
  broad masses of people, as in the days of the Commune of Paris of 1793 when the
  Committees of Public Safety became the eyes and ears of the Revolution. This is what
  the social democrats have never understood.</p>

  <p>The term democracy, this most valuable abstraction, if taken in its absolutist
  sense, is the nexus which ties social democracy to the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Yet the proponents of democracy who really come from the bourgeoisie proper do not
  entertain any abstract, absolutist conceptions of democracy or adhere to it in any
  measure. They solidly support only <strong>bourgeois democracy</strong>, the democracy
  that serves their ends. In Eastern Europe, this means to regain and strengthen their
  hold on the means of production from which they have been expropriated.</p>

  <p>Does it ever occur to the social democrats, the leftist ones in particular, why it
  is that the bourgeoisie, who are so fervently for abstract, absolutist democracy in
  general, never cross over the class lines to support socialist democracy? Isn't that
  the nub of the whole question?</p>

  <h4>No bourgeois support for workers' democracy</h4>

  <p>The Paris Commune was democratic to a fault. There was complete workers' democracy
  during the Leninist period. And workers' democracy has thrived in Cuba and China. Why
  doesn't the bourgeoisie support that kind of socialist democracy? They are only
  interested in getting mass support for the kind of democracy which supports the
  expropriation of the workers' property in the interests of regaining it for themselves.
  That's the kind of democracy they have been preaching and promoting all these many
  years in Eastern Europe.</p>

  <p>Before the Russian Revolution, European social democracy stood for the principle of
  the public ownership of the means of production, a planned economy and a monopoly of
  foreign trade. It stood for the building of socialism on the basis of the abolition of
  capitalism. But when the struggle for socialism actually began, the social democracy
  wavered and turned against the revolutionary seizure of power.</p>

  <p>Thus the program of social democracy as it had existed in the pre-Leninist era was
  carried out by the Bolshevik Revolution. The progressive aspects of what had been the
  common program of the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks (later to become the communists and
  the social democrats) were completely taken over the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks also
  took over the program of the Social Revolutionaries, land to the peasants, because the
  SRs hesitated and turned against land seizures by the peasants.</p>

  <p>The historical role of social democracy was further limited by the vast Soviet
  industrialization, the institution of centralized planning, and the general increase in
  the standard of living of the masses in the USSR. Therefore social democracy's raison
  d'etre as a traditional political current of the left was wholly preempted by
  Bolshevism.</p>

  <h4>Social democracy's progressive role exhausted</h4>

  <p>Its only progressive role could be if it sought to advance still further the
  objectives of a planned economy, more widespread socialist construction, and
  collectivization based on democratic procedures. In none of this did social democracy
  play any role. It became especially clear after the Second World War that as an
  independent, progressive political current, social democracy had no further
  function.</p>

  <p>None realized this more than the imperialist bourgeoisie, who opened their arms to
  what remained of the social democratic current and used it to bolster the remnants of
  the bourgeoisie in the USSR and in Eastern Europe. More than ever, the imperialist
  bourgeoisie broadened the term anti-Stalinism to mean pro-bourgeois restoration. And
  the social democrats joined this, wittingly or unwittingly.</p>

  <p>Somehow, they would bring about a socialist regeneration by joining the bourgeois
  restorationists. The specifics were never made clear.</p>

  <p>All sorts of leftists who advocated democratic rights did not distinguish themselves
  as an independent socialist or communist tendency but in fact liquidated in the general
  milieu of bourgeois dissidence whatever program they might have held subjectively. They
  became accomplices of the bourgeois restorationist movement.</p>

  <p>For a while they were dazzled with the lies and deceit of the free market, even
  though the free market presupposes the existence of capitalist exploitation.</p>

  <h4>Cheers and moans</h4>

  <p>Now that they see the results, some react with horror. They moan and groan over the
  sight of the multinational corporations and the banks moving in to take everything and
  anything that formerly belonged to the workers' state, however badly that state might
  have suffered bureaucratic deformations. Not a day goes by when imperialist
  corporations are not moving into Hungary, Poland and Romania. The GDR, seemingly the
  most solid, is now being swallowed up by German imperialism in alliance with the U.S.,
  Britain and France. It is a ghastly sight.</p>

  <p>Yet, at the Socialist Scholars Conference, they intone their happiness at the
  passing of Stalinism while groaning at the takeover by the imperialist colossus.</p>

  <p>Daniel Singer, one of the speakers, once painted an idyllic picture about how the
  Solidarity-led movement would lead to socialism in his book <em>The Road to
  Gdansk.</em> Instead it has led Poland into the hands of the Johnson &amp; Johnson
  family, who say that they'll invest there (and pay steelworkers 50 cents an hour) if
  there are no more lucrative investments, with higher returns, elsewhere. Even Singer
  himself cannot deny that the dream has turned out to be a nightmare. As he now says, "A
  specter is haunting Europe &mdash; the specter of capitalism." Unfortunately, it's more
  than a specter. It's the reality.</p>

  <p>To be progressive in relationship to Stalin's policy means first of all being
  thoroughly anti-imperialist and absolutely separate from bourgeois opposition to
  Stalinism. What's on the order of the day is the struggle against bourgeois
  restoration. But this is precisely what the social democrats want to hide &mdash; that
  the working class in both Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union has to take on the
  bourgeois restorationist movement, which has brought back the imperialist monopolies,
  wage cutting, unemployment and inflation.</p>

  <p>We have shown [in our book <em>Poland &mdash; Behind the Crisis</em>] that as early
  as 1979, the most formidable U.S. banks had gained control of the basic elements of the
  Polish economy. This was front-page news in the New York Times on Jan. 26, 1979, but
  unfortunately our leftist social democrats did not seem to notice it.</p>

  <p>By 1985 Poland had piled up a debt of almost $30 billion because the capitalists
  would not open their markets as they had promised and because the Poles were unable to
  overturn the socialized economy so as to suit the bankers from the IMF and the World
  Bank. All this is indisputable. Having started on the road of bourgeois reforms and
  abandoning the socialized industries, the government found itself in a continuing
  impasse from which it could not get out. Ultimately it capitulated outright to the
  demands of the imperialist bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>In the age of satellites and electronics, it is absolutely impossible to have a
  socialist policy in any metropolitan imperialist country without having a firm, clear
  and undeviating policy in relation to imperialism, which is still the center of the
  world economy.</p>

  <p>The fact that these socialist scholars did not deign to mention imperialism, whose
  overwhelming effect in Eastern Europe is manifest, demonstrates the bankruptcy of their
  policy.</p>
