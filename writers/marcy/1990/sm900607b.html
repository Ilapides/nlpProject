  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Right message, wrong messenger (June 7, 1990)</title>

  <h1>Right message, wrong messenger</h1>

  <h2>Japanese emperor appologizes to Korea</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (June 7, 1990)</h5>

  <p>For the second time in a decade, Japan has formally apologized for its brutal
  colonial oppression of Korea (1910-1945) and the imperialist war of aggression it waged
  there. This time the apology was given by the emperor himself, rather than by the prime
  minister, and so is regarded as having greater significance.</p>

  <p>The whole thing carries with it the heavy weight of irony, for the emperor's apology
  was made not to the Korean people but to Roh Tae Woo, the bloody puppet of U.S.
  imperialism, who at the very same time was suppressing the workers and students in
  south Korea with a brutality unmatched in the decades since dictator Syngman Rhee
  departed from the scene.</p>

  <h4>Attempt to bolster Roh</h4>

  <p>What makes this apology so repugnant is that it was made to Roh as though he were
  the representative of the Korean people. Yet south Korea has been convulsed in massive
  strikes and demonstrations which demonstrate conclusively that the masses of people
  there see him as a mercenary politician acting on behalf of the giant multinational
  corporations of the U.S. and its political and military establishment.</p>

  <p>It also totally ignores the authentic leadership of the Korean people which resides
  in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, whose cadres led the struggle against
  Japanese colonialism in the 1930s and '40s.</p>

  <p>While the apology may be good publicity for the Japanese ruling class in some parts
  of Asia, it is to be noted that the emperor's remarks only referred to Japan's military
  role. He said nothing about the enormous economic stranglehold which Japanese finance
  capital has over the southern part of the Korean peninsula.</p>

  <p>Also, it comes at a time when the rivalry between Japanese and U.S. imperialism has
  been intensified to a truly acute stage; every weapon available to each of the
  predatory plunderers of the Korean peninsula is being used, not the least of which is
  hypocrisy.</p>

  <h4>U.S. and Japan exploit Korea</h4>

  <p>Neither Japan nor the U.S. shows any real intent of withdrawing its oppression of
  the Korean people. It would be one thing if the Japanese government and the finance
  capitalists it serves were to renounce their investments and the super-profits they
  garner from the sweat and blood of Korean workers. On the contrary, the apology is
  calculated to prettify the super-exploitation of the Korean workers.</p>

  <p>Likewise, nothing whatever has come out of the Bush administration to indicate that
  it is moving away from the concept of the permanent division of the Korean peninsula.
  If they were looking for a diplomatic opening, the recent return by the DPRK of the
  remains of five U.S. servicemen killed in the Korean War affords the opportunity for a
  reciprocal gesture on the part of the U.S. However, nothing has been forthcoming.</p>

  <p>This ought to serve as a reminder to the broad current of progressives here and to
  the working class movement in general that it is more timely than ever to vigorously
  raise the question of the U.S. military occupation of south Korea, which is solely
  responsible for the artificial division of the peninsula.</p>

  <p>The intransigence of the U.S. ruling class on the Korean question can be seen in the
  uniformity of the capitalist press, which fails to carry any of the important
  declarations from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the status of the
  peninsula, the burning question of reunification, and the multitude of problems arising
  almost daily out of the division of Korea.</p>

  <h4>Kim Il Sung's proposal on UN seat</h4>

  <p>As just one example, there is the recent proposal of President Kim Il Sung that if
  Korea becomes a member of the United Nations before reunification, the north and the
  south should enter jointly with one seat. (See accompanying article.)</p>

  <p>This important suggestion, like many others made by the DPRK to promote
  reunification, has been ignored by the imperialist media. No references have been made
  to it in articles dealing with Asian affairs. Indeed, when the declarations of the DPRK
  are mentioned at all, it is usually as a mere footnote to other events in Asia. The
  result is that the U.S. public is kept in ignorance of developments in the DPRK, and in
  south Korea as well.</p>

  <p>One seat for Korea. Some here will immediately find this objectionable, on the
  ground that the two parts of Korea are sharply divided from each other, not just
  politically but more importantly by the nature of their opposing social systems.
  Certainly this raises some very important questions, which pose considerable difficulty
  in the way of solution.</p>

  <p>But there can be no valid discussion with respect to these questions as long as
  there is a total military occupation of south Korea and a continuing buildup of the
  military outreach of the U.S. Navy and Air Force, with their aircraft carriers, their
  threatening annual military exercises, their nuclear bombs and over 45,000 military
  personnel.</p>

  <p>How can any of these questions be discussed properly when a gun is being held to the
  heads of the negotiators? The issue of reunification, how and by what means, and the
  representation in the UN are proper, urgent topics for discussion between the north and
  the south. But this cannot take place in the real sense of the word as long as the
  military presence of the U.S. hangs over their heads.</p>

  <p>One seat for Korea to be worked out in free discussions between them is perfectly in
  accord with the Leninist conception of the right of nations to self-determination. The
  imperialist strategy to line up international support for recognition of two Koreas is
  a violation of this right.</p>

  <h4>Priority is get U.S. troops out</h4>

  <p>For us here, the priority should be to get the U.S. troops out, which is completely
  in harmony with the interests of the working class and the oppressed peoples in this
  country. It will reduce the influence and power of U.S. militarism and strengthen the
  anti-imperialist movement everywhere in Asia. It will redound to the benefit of those
  still struggling under the heel of imperialism in other parts of the world,
  particularly in Latin America.</p>
