  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: When war hawks turn to doves (Nov. 22, 1990)</title>

  <h1>When war hawks turn to doves</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Nov. 22, 1990)</h5>

  <p>Here the old colonialist-imperialist powers have been thinking that a great new day
  is dawning for them. They could unite in a secret agreement to divide the oil wealth of
  the Middle East, break up OPEC, and share out the world markets and resources among
  themselves on the basis of the destruction of the Iraqi regime.</p>

  <p>This would give them the military and political leverage necessary to subdue the
  Arabian peninsula as a potentially significant regional power in world affairs.</p>

  <p>Headed by the U.S. military-industrial complex and the big banks, the imperialists
  formed a united front that stretched from Tokyo to Denmark. Such unity is rare among
  them. Didn't they conduct two bloody imperialist world wars among themselves, as well
  as innumerable counterrevolutionary insurrections and interventions abroad? Thus, this
  new coalition seemed like a singular accomplishment.</p>

  <h4>History littered with secret deals</h4>

  <p>Of course, agreements among the world's biggest capitalist monopolists and
  transnational corporations are not precisely new. Even in the midst of the First World
  War, the imperialist powers of France, Britain and Czarist Russia arrived at a secret
  agreement (the Sykes-Picot agreement) on dividing the Arabian peninsula among
  themselves. That was in 1916, before the U.S. entered the war and challenged the secret
  agreement.</p>

  <p>The contradictions among the imperialists are so severe because each is attempting
  to appropriate superprofits at the expense of the others. These superprofits are of
  course obtained from the blood and sweat of the exploited and oppressed peoples both at
  home and abroad.</p>

  <p>It is rare for them to attain unity not only because of the severity of these
  contradictions but also because of the instability of the capitalist system, which
  careens between so-called capitalist prosperity and economic crisis. So it was
  something of an accomplishment that, after Iraq's intervention into Kuwait, they put
  together a formidable coalition of imperialist powers able to whip the UN Security
  Council into line, along with some of the Arab regimes that have been supported by U.S.
  imperialism for a long time with money and military equipment.</p>

  <p>It must be borne in mind that an imperialist alliance is one thing, while an
  alliance of Arab states to support a struggle against Iraq is another. The latter is an
  alliance of imperialist stooges from oppressed countries where the governments
  represent the compradore bourgeoisie, that is, the bourgeoisie that accommodate
  themselves to the needs of the imperialists rather than to the needs of the workers and
  peasants at home. Such alliances are most susceptible to a revolutionary overturn once
  military struggle really begins.</p>

  <h4>What Baker found on his trip</h4>

  <p>U.S. Secretary of State James Baker's visit this past week to all the Arab states
  and to the imperialists abroad made it clear that while they are united in their
  objectives, they are fearful of the actual military offensive which the U.S. is
  preparing on such a gargantuan scale.</p>

  <p>Of course, each of the imperialists is counting on getting something in return for
  their agreement to support the U.S. plunder of the Arabian peninsula. What each has
  been promised has not been revealed as yet. But it is safe to say that the French
  imperialists, for one, believe they didn't get enough and have once more found it
  necessary to distance themselves from the U.S.</p>

  <p>China is not an imperialist power and has been virtually embargoed and isolated by
  U.S. imperialism since the crushing of the counterrevolutionary Tiananmen uprising a
  year and a half ago. However, it has joined in limited cooperation with the
  imperialists, agreeing to go along with all the UN Security Council resolutions. In
  return, many of the restrictions the imperialists had imposed on China have been
  lifted. That's the quid pro quo for China.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the USSR, now in the midst of their biggest crisis since they began
  the attempt to transform the Soviet system into a bourgeois state, have been
  collaborating closely with U.S. imperialism. Yet they find it impossible to go beyond
  supporting the U.S. through UN resolutions (10 of them).</p>

  <p>The Pentagon tried to go over the heads of the Gorbachev administration and deal
  directly with the Soviet military when it arranged a meeting between the military
  chiefs of the two countries, generals Mikhail Moiseyev and Colin Powell. But Moiseyev
  used the occasion to announce to the press that there should be no military
  intervention in Iraq.</p>

  <p>The Japanese imperialists, who originally offered troops, ran into a storm of
  opposition from the population, which was reflected in the parliament. So great was the
  uproar that they have scaled down their participation to economic, humanitarian
  aid.</p>

  <p>It is not known what subterranean efforts the Pentagon is making at economic and
  political intrigue to get the allied imperialists to support military action. But the
  scale of the U.S. military effort has scared them because it shows that the U.S. is
  moving heaven and earth to be in a position where it will be able to take everything
  for itself.</p>

  <h4>Fear of an Arab explosion</h4>

  <p>Just as important, the imperialists fear massive revolutionary struggles by Arab
  workers and peasants. Might not the guns in the hands of the Arab soldiers be turned
  against the very regimes they are supposedly fighting for &mdash; and against the
  imperialist armies of the U.S. above all?</p>

  <p>Broad anti-war sentiment in the U.S. (surprisingly strong at such an early stage)
  was made visible when the Coalition to Stop U.S. Intervention in the Middle East
  organized the Sept. 13 rally in New York City's Cooper Union, followed by mass
  demonstrations around the country on Oct. 20.</p>

  <p>These are the factors which have impelled war hawks like Senator Sam Nunn (D-Ga.)
  and semi-hawks like Senator Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) to suddenly remember that Congress
  must vote for a war before the president has the right to launch it.</p>

  <p>It's true that when thieves fall out, honest people have a chance to come into their
  own. But it would be a grave error to believe that the present-day Congress, composed
  mostly of senators and representatives directly linked to the bosses, bankers and
  military-industrial complex as a whole, would be able to convene a session to actually
  stop a war in the Middle East and withdraw the troops.</p>

  <h4>Congress never stopped a war</h4>

  <p>What happened in the Vietnam war? Congress did nothing to end it. The U.S. was
  thrown out of Vietnam after millions were killed by Pentagon guns, bombs and ships. The
  war finally ended after a brilliant military victory by the Vietnamese, which was also
  helped by the mass pressure of the anti-war movement here and around the world.</p>

  <p>Congress talked but did nothing. Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon &mdash; two
  Democrats and a Republican &mdash; all talked peace but continued the war until the
  very last soldier was out.</p>

  <p>This war is not fundamentally different from any of the imperialist wars conducted
  in the past. What is different, however, is the potential for a revolutionary overthrow
  of those Arab regimes supporting the imperialist powers.</p>

  <h4>An oil glut?</h4>

  <p>In the U.S. itself, the hundreds of thousands of layoffs, including at the big
  banks, show that the economic crisis is underway. But there's also an <strong>oil
  glut</strong>. USA Today reports (Nov. 13) that "some experts [are] saying the world is
  on the verge of an oil glut ... [because of] sluggish economies worldwide."</p>

  <p>What's the answer? The daily quotes an oil industry consultant as saying, "The only
  way the glut will vanish is if war breaks out in the Middle East."</p>

  <p>Thus the imperialists are making a linkage between the war and the economic crisis.
  But the workers also see them as linked &mdash; that the rich, having taken their jobs
  and economic security, now want to take their lives.</p>

  <p>These factors are leading to a truly formidable resurgence of the labor movement and
  of the oppressed nationalities, which are tending in the direction of a united
  anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist front.</p>

  <p>The hawks hope that if Congress convenes, it will actually authorize the war rather
  than stop it. The so-called opposition in Congress and among the bourgeoisie generally
  would prefer to attain their objective peacefully, through economic strangulation like
  embargoes, even if that causes the death of hundreds of thousands. They want economic
  warfare as against military warfare.</p>

  <p>All the more necessary is it for the anti-war movement to demand an end to the
  strangulation of the Arab masses through economic warfare, and spread the message that
  nothing less than complete withdrawal of U.S. forces will stop this war.</p>
