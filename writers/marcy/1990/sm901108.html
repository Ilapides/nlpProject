  <h1>The military's hand in the United Nations</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Nov 8, 1990)</h5>

  <p>What is the most ominous development as regards the war crisis in the Middle
  East?</p>

  <p>It is not the new resolution of the UN Security Council, onerous as that is, holding
  Iraq liable for damages in Kuwait. That could be taken in stride by the Iraqi
  government and by the anti-imperialist forces throughout the world.</p>

  <p>What ought to alarm all those who oppose U.S. intervention in the Middle East but
  who cling to the hope of a peaceful solution through the UN Security Council is the
  blunt fact that the five permanent members of the Security Council have convened its
  Military Staff Committee for the first time in years. How is this consistent with the
  search for a peaceful solution? Doesn't it contradict the very mission of the Security
  Council as a diplomatic tool rather than a military one? Or are we going back to the
  good old days of the Korean War and of UN intervention in the Congo, when the U.S.
  manipulated the UN?</p>

  <p>This is the account given in the New York Times of Oct. 30:</p>

  <p>The five big powers with permanent Council seats sought to reinforce [the] implicit
  threat of force today by convening the Security Council's military advisory body at the
  highest level in United Nations history.</p>

  <p>For the first time the United States sent a three-star general from Washington to
  represent the Joint Chiefs of Staff at a meeting of the Security Council's Military
  Staff Committee, called to review the situation in the Persian Gulf and the efforts
  there to enforce the trade embargo against Iraq.</p>

  <p>Lt. Gen. Michael Carns, Director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, was joined by
  Col. Gen. Bronislav A. Omelichev, First Deputy Chief of the Soviet General Staff, who
  came from Moscow for the talks, and by Vice Adm. Alain Coatanea, a senior French naval
  officer from Paris.</p>

  <p>China was represented by Maj. Gen. Du Guanyi, the head of its delegation to the
  committee, and Britain by Maj. Gen. Edwin H.A. Beckett, head of the British Defense
  Staff in Washington.</p>

  <p>Several delegates addressed the Council in terms that suggested that a decision to
  use force might not be far away.</p>

  <h4>UN military advisory body &mdash; where was it?</h4>

  <p>What is this military committee? What is its function? Where has it been all these
  many years when the imperialist West was intervening in Asia, Africa and Latin America?
  Where was it during the Vietnam War, three Arab-Israeli wars, the U.S. interventions in
  Cuba, Nicaragua, Grenada, Panama, Afghanistan and so on?</p>

  <p>Why is this military council being revitalized when it has been a dead letter all
  these years?</p>

  <p>It is true that in some of the conflicts of the imperialists in the Third World,
  military attaches have been dispatched to act as mediators and to see that a cease-fire
  is observed. But these advisers have always been chosen from other countries like
  Sweden and India, not the five big veto powers.</p>

  <p>Why has this group now been convened without an explanation of its function? We
  thought that the issue of military cooperation of the big five was finally settled, at
  least insofar as the USSR was concerned, when the Bush government went over the head of
  the Soviet government and invited its Chief of Staff, Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, to come to
  Washington and discuss military coordination with Gen. Colin Powell. The answer given
  by the Soviet Chief of Staff was clear and unambiguous. The USSR was only for a
  peaceful, diplomatic solution. No need for military cooperation, when only diplomatic
  means had been agreed to.</p>

  <p>Now we learn that the five are meeting for military cooperation.</p>

  <p>The Security Council is supposed to deal with diplomacy, not with coordination of
  military forces. Will it be denied that this is what the committee's mission is? The
  five big powers &mdash; the U.S., the USSR, China, Britain and France &mdash; have
  gotten together, presumably to coordinate or discuss a military attack on Iraq.</p>

  <p>However, Gorbachev is reported to have said during his visit to Paris this week that
  a military solution would be unacceptable. This again confirms the vacillations of
  current Soviet diplomacy.</p>

  <h4>Gorbachev's sick joke</h4>

  <p>Worse still is Gorbachev's suggestion that Saudi Arabia take the initiative in the
  peace process. This can only be understood as a sick joke. At the moment, Saudi Arabia
  is a country fully occupied by U.S. armed forces. It is engaged in an utterly inhuman
  act of evicting half a million Yemenis from its territory, some of whom have lived and
  worked there for decades, leaving them destitute for no other reason than that Yemen
  had the temerity to abstain from the Security Council's votes against Iraq.</p>

  <p>Why is there no outcry against this cruel and inhuman act, which is on a par with
  what the Israelis have done to the Palestinians?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the U.S. buildup continues, under the pretext of stopping Iraqi
  aggression. But Iraq is not about to attack U.S. forces, unless of course the U.S. has
  already opened up a provocative military assault. Every message that comes out of Iraq
  shows a more and more conciliatory tone towards a diplomatic solution. It welcomes
  peace initiatives.</p>

  <p>According to both the foreign minister of Yemen and UN sources, Iraq offered to
  release all foreigners in return for an endorsement by both Gorbachev and Mitterrand
  during their Paris summit of a diplomatic rather than a military solution. "Mr.
  Gorbachev maintained his oft-stated view that a military solution was unacceptable in
  the gulf crisis," wrote the New York Times correspondent from France on Oct. 29, "but
  there was no comparable statement from Mr. Mitterrand."</p>

  <p>Iraq does not intend to withdraw from Kuwait at the demand of the imperialist
  powers, but it is willing to discuss with any and all concerned the steps to a truly
  peaceful solution. That is as far as any government can go which is under siege by all
  the imperialist powers.</p>

  <h4>New world situation</h4>

  <p>Could all this have happened without the extraordinary turn of events in the Soviet
  Union and Eastern Europe? It is plain to the whole world now that the USSR leadership
  has turned from that of a defender, albeit a limited one, of the oppressed people
  against imperialism, to a collaborator with the imperialists. That is the most
  significant aspect of the world struggle as it concerns the Middle East.</p>

  <p>From a defender of the oppressed, from an antagonist against imperialism, it has
  well-nigh become their ally. For the last several weeks Gorbachev's deputy, Yevgeny
  Primakov, has attempted to broker a deal with Iraq on behalf of the imperialists. He is
  not acting as a neutral but as a mediator on behalf of the imperialists, which is
  something else altogether.</p>

  <p>If he has come home empty-handed, as is the case right now, it should be no
  surprise. He is acting as one of the principals involved, who voted every time in the
  UN Security Council against Iraq &mdash; which the imperialists, particularly the U.S.,
  have demanded. He came to speak for the UN resolutions, for the embargo, and also to
  convey threats of further measures. Primakov's role repeats that of UN Secretary
  General Perez de Cuellar, who went to Iraq not as a mediator, not as a neutral, but as
  a messenger to deliver the ultimatum of the Security Council.</p>

  <p>Now, who leads the Security Council? First and foremost, of course, the U.S. If the
  Security Council were not the representative of the most belligerent, most aggressive
  imperialist powers, it would have at least rebuked the U.S. for deciding to expand the
  number of American forces in the Persian Gulf to the tune of 100,000 more troops. That
  is the very least that should have been done.</p>

  <p>Is this not a warlike act? Where is the country which would not look upon such a
  move in its own region with the greatest apprehension, and prepare necessary measures
  for defense?</p>

  <p>Did the U.S. government even send in writing a note to the UN to the effect that
  this is what is now in the works? Who in fact is the aggressor here? The imperialist
  naval armada in the gulf is boarding Iraqi ships in search of so-called contraband.
  This is a warlike act. All throughout naval history it has been regarded as such. Yet
  Iraq has permitted the boarding and searching of its ships. Everything that Iraq has
  done is calculated not to provoke the imperialists.</p>

  <h4>Role of USSR and China</h4>

  <p>What is the interest of the USSR and China, both of which regard themselves as
  socialist?</p>

  <p>For decades they took on the role of defenders of the oppressed. In fact, they
  carried out a long-running debate over the best strategy to pursue in the struggle to
  overcome imperialism. Why should they now become partners with imperialism in such a
  venture?</p>

  <p>One may say that both China and the USSR are considerable producers of petroleum.
  That is true. But are they competitors with Iraq? The answer is no. The oil from Iraq
  is produced at lower costs, and moreover is of a different grade. But even leaving that
  aside, neither China nor the USSR showed any sign of accommodating with imperialism
  during the earlier wars in the Middle East in 1967 or in 1973, which resulted in the
  Arab oil boycott. Rather than join in with the imperialists against the Arab
  oil-producing countries, they defended them and, on the level of party-to-party
  polemics, each rivaled with the other in denouncing U.S. imperialism for its role.</p>

  <p>The answer is that the domestic changes in the USSR and in China have been of such a
  reactionary character as to strip them of their revolutionary and anti-imperialist
  positions and make them willing accomplices of the imperialist powers.</p>

  <p>It will be said in response, and very loudly indeed, that both the USSR and Chinese
  representatives to the Security Council are against the use of force; they are for a
  diplomatic solution. Oh yes, indeed, they have said that and continue to say it day in
  and day out. But at the same time they are upholding the position of the
  imperialists.</p>

  <p>Socialist countries have no business whatever joining in an imperialist alliance to
  condemn an oppressed country. The struggle for self-determination and the class
  struggle itself are matters for the people in the Arabian peninsula to decide.</p>

  <p>An alliance with the imperialists goes against the class interests, not only of a
  socialist country, but of the world proletariat and oppressed peoples. This used to be
  ABC for all communists, for all in the progressive, anti-imperialist camp. The change
  in alignment has come about as a result of reactionary and counter-revolutionary
  developments in the socialist countries that are reflected in their policies on foreign
  affairs.</p>

  <p>It's true that neither the Soviet Union nor China is willing to overtly join a
  military struggle on behalf of the imperialists. But they have gone to considerable
  lengths in mobilizing world public opinion to justify the deployment of U.S. military
  forces. And while China and the USSR speak about the possibility and the desirability
  of a peaceful solution, both Secretary of State Baker and President Bush reaffirmed on
  Oct. 29 that they have under consideration the military option, the use of force
  against Iraq. They are continuing to build up their troop strength without any pause
  whatsoever.</p>

  <h4>Much ado over the neo-isolationists</h4>

  <p>Here it is necessary to brush aside some mutterings from the capitalist press
  regarding possible differences within the ruling class. First, on the side of the
  ultra-right is the line of Pat Buchanan. Ever since the so-called end of the Cold War
  he has been promoting a neo-isolationist line of abandoning the military deployment and
  cutting out most of the aid to Israel, as a way of attaining an accommodation with the
  Arab puppet regimes.</p>

  <p>This line should not fool the working class and the anti-war forces in this country.
  Its anti-Israeli stance is nine-tenths meant to be anti-Semitic, and its so-called
  pro-Arab line is built on the sandy foundations that the puppet regimes in the Middle
  East will endure forever without a revolutionary overturn. This grouping is not taken
  seriously by any in the ruling class except for peripheral ex-Reaganites like Jeane
  Kirkpatrick.</p>

  <p>When the Midwest was still considered the basis of U.S. agricultural prowess and
  growing industrial strength, isolationism was an important factor in foreign affairs.
  That was when you could still talk about farmers in the millions and independent farms
  were important to agriculture. But that era has been superseded. Today agribusiness is
  dominated by the chemical, pharmaceutical and fertilizer industries and the big banks.
  While in earlier years, farm produce was mostly for domestic consumption, today
  agricultural exports have become of primary importance for U.S. big business and high
  finance.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the agricultural produce of the U.S. has a great deal of military
  significance. It's a lethal weapon of the Pentagon in the struggle to subjugate small
  countries with a great deficiency in food. The so-called aid programs to poor countries
  are a way of tying them to the chariot wheel of U.S. big business and finance.</p>

  <p>The Midwest farm belt was the base for the isolationism of Senator Borah before the
  first World War. Before World War II there was Senator Burton K. Wheeler and his
  ever-diminishing coterie of supporters. Wheeler relied on the prestige of Colonel
  Charles Lindbergh, who was mesmerized by the might of the Luftwaffe but had virtually
  no support in the ruling class for his propaganda.</p>

  <h4>Illusions about UN role</h4>

  <p>The more serious problem we have to consider is the illusion that the UN is an
  international expression of the will of its many member countries, and can have a
  substantial influence on the direction of aggressive, militaristic imperialism.</p>

  <p>The truly progressive anti-war forces in this country have to explain that the UN is
  a cover for an alliance of all the imperialist countries, extending from Tokyo to
  Denmark. Their aim is to redivide the world's resources, to deliver a death blow to
  OPEC as an economic organization, and even more to the political independence of the
  Middle East. They seek to reassert imperialist dominance, divide the booty derived from
  the sweat and blood of the oppressed peoples everywhere, and redistribute it in
  accordance to the new world relationships. That's what the struggle is about.</p>

  <p>It would be all to the good if the problem of U.S. imperialist aggression throughout
  the world could be solved peaceably and justly through the United Nations. Indeed, it
  would be a very easy and welcome solution. But one just has to view ever so
  superficially the record of the last half century. Where has the UN ever intervened to
  stop the U.S. war machine? In Vietnam? Cambodia? Grenada? Panama? Did it ever really
  solve a problem? The most it ever did was to ratify or validate a victory of an
  oppressed country against imperialism after the battle had been won, as for instance in
  Namibia. And even then, the imperialists continue to hang on and try to get back in,
  often through the UN itself.</p>

  <p>It is only the progressive, widespread and relentless intervention of the masses on
  a truly gigantic scale which can stop the mad adventure of the Pentagon, the
  military-industrial complex, the banks and the Bush administration. The latter is
  nothing more than what Marx described: the executive committee of the ruling class.</p>
