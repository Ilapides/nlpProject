  The collapse of Laker Airways</h1>

  <h4>February 8, 1982</h4>

  <p>The collapse of Laker Airways is more than a major disaster in the international
  airline industry. It reaches far beyond that into the inner reaches of the giant banks
  and the military-industrial complex in which the aerospace industry is a key
  factor.</p>

  <p>The demise of Laker Airways is bound to aggravate and deepen the world capitalist
  crisis. It will also sharpen the hidden antagonisms between the British and U.S.
  capitalist governments.</p>

  <p>Although billed as a major <strong>British</strong> entrepreneurial innovation Laker
  Airways was deeply and intimately connected with the U.S air travel and aerospace
  industries. The role in its collapse of the U.S. capitalist government under the Reagan
  regime should not be overlooked, as it has been in most of the capitalist press.</p>

  <p><strong>Did U.S. force bankruptcy?</strong></p>

  <p>In particular, the role of the Export-Import Bank, an arm of the U.S. government,
  should be carefully examined. The bank holds a mortgage of considerable dimensions on
  Laker's planes, running beyond some $86 million.</p>

  <p>The Export-Import Bank of the U.S. also guaranteed a loan made by the private Export
  Funding Corporation as part of a $228 million package, of which $60 million is due. All
  told, it seems, the Export-import Bank holds about $147 million of Laker
  indebtedness.</p>

  <p>Also, it holds the first mortgage on five planes of Laker's and, in case of default,
  it can take possession of the aircraft to recoup some of its money. Since the
  Export-Import Bank is an arm of the U.S. government the Reagan administration can
  easily manipulate the financial situation of Laker Airways.</p>

  <p>Consultations between the Reagan regime and the Thatcher government must have
  preceded the forced bankruptcy U.S. private banks and the Export-Import government bank
  of the U.S. could easily have staved off a default. But they chose not to.</p>

  <p>The Thatcher government, with British Airways itself in deep trouble, would not
  intervene with British banks to save Laker Airways.</p>

  <p>The Laker debacle comes, therefore, as a boon to U.S. airlines, especially Pan
  American, TWA, and others who were in very sharp and venomous competition with
  Laker.</p>

  <p>The collapse of the Laker venture is illustrative of a number of very fundamental
  laws concerning the present phase of capitalist economic degeneration.</p>

  <p><strong>Laker and Henry Ford</strong></p>

  <p>We should, however, first go over some of the salient facts concerning Laker and
  find out just what this unique capitalist entrepreneur was trying to do.</p>

  <p>Freddie Laker was attempting what Henry Ford did in an earlier era, when the auto
  industry was in its infancy and before monopoly capitalism had fully matured.</p>

  <p>Henry Ford began his automobile venture by cutting the cost of production and
  adapting the conveyor belt and assembly line to automobile production. He introduced
  mass production in the auto industry and thereby was able to feature an inexpensive,
  standardized car.</p>

  <p>He was soon thereafter able to out distance all his competitors by producing a car
  for the millions. His Model T, designed in 1908 began to sell in the millions where
  previously the auto market was restricted to the more privileged buyers.</p>

  <p>Ford had several advantages which Laker does not. Ford was able to gain control of
  raw materials and also the means of distribution.</p>

  <p>Like Ford, Laker tried to show that he could successfully reduce prices. He cut
  trans-Atlantic passenger fares by half. Thus, a London to New York flight cost the
  passenger $135, half what was charged by the other giant airlines.</p>

  <p>Putting aside his flamboyant methods and general right-wing political demagogy which
  is typical of an earlier buccaneer-type age Laker tried to break up the virtual
  monopoly that exists in trans-Atlantic and domestic air travel. He proved highly
  successful for a period of time. But only for a period of time.</p>

  <p>His cost-cutting methods forced the giants to reduce air fares. The giants, too,
  were interested in cutting costs and fares if it raised the profit level. But that was
  just the point. Laker's cost-cutting of the fares cut deep into the profit level of the
  giant airlines. He kept gaining passengers while they sustained losses. He therefore
  earned the unmitigated anger of the international monopolists, in the aerospace as well
  as airline industries.</p>

  <p>Laker's mode of operation &mdash; cost-cutting and reducing the fares virtually by
  half &mdash; opened air travel to vast sections of the population, including the middle
  class and many from the working class.</p>

  <p>The rule under the early competitive, so-called relatively progressive epoch of
  capitalist development was for the bankers and manufacturers to support somebody like
  Laker as against the giants. Why?</p>

  <p>Because at that time the more efficient producer would succeed as against the less
  efficient, more costly capitalist entrepreneur.</p>

  <p>The entire theoretical edifice of early capitalist political economy rested on the
  assumption that the more efficient producer should prevail over the less efficient,
  more costly one. Present day apologists for imperialist monopolies still repeat this
  old truth, but it no longer fits the conditions of capitalist monopoly.</p>

  <p>Under the old rule, Freddie Laker would be a winner, like Henry Ford.</p>

  <p>But Laker's methods &mdash; the methods of mass production, if one can apply that
  formula &mdash; resulted in profit losses for the giants. And it is the profit motive,
  lest we forget, which is the motor force of the capitalist mode of production.</p>

  <p>Thus we see that mere improvement in the means of production and distribution, or
  the introduction of new methods in rendering a service on a mass production basis, are
  only acceptable and practical in the contemporary capitalist epoch if they maintain and
  increase the margin of profit Failing that the monopolists who control the industry and
  the bankers and suppliers who dominate the vital arteries of the aviation industry,
  turn thumbs down on such innovations as introducing low-cost, mass transportation by
  air.</p>

  <p>Was Laker Airways really on the verge of bankruptcy as a result of its bold
  innovations in mass air travel? Not really.</p>

  <p>Laker's sin was that he still tried to expand in the midst of a capitalist
  recession, thereby making further inroads into the airline monopolists' inner sanctum.
  To do that, he needed to reschedule some of his debts.</p>

  <p><strong>Expansion blocked by recession</strong></p>

  <p>This was not an extraordinary demand nor an unusual practice. This is done over and
  over again in the entire capitalist air travel and aviation industry business,
  including the aerospace industry which is intimately connected and part and parcel of
  the military-industrial complex.</p>

  <p>But to get a credit extension or rollover of funds requires the O. K, of the very
  monopolist grouping which first of all gave him the opportunity to get into the
  business. The banks refused to give an extension of the debt or reschedule it.</p>

  <p>They refused not really because he was losing money, but because his price-cutting
  practices were wreaking havoc on the profit level of the industry.</p>

  <p><strong>State subsidizes airlines</strong></p>

  <p>It should be noted that the entire airline industry is subsidized by the capitalist
  state in the U.S. as well as in Europe and Asia. The subsidies granted to them are of
  both a direct as well as indirect character. No one can succeed in the industry without
  the permission of the giant banks and access to the credit markets which finance the
  airline and aviation industry.</p>

  <p>From 1978 until about 1980, the capitalist world was recovering from one of its
  endless crises. Beginning early last year the capitalist economy worldwide took another
  plunge, this time far more serious and devastating than the previous one.</p>

  <p>Today it has virtually encompassed the whole capitalist world. And its disease has
  also enveloped to a limited extent some of the socialist countries. Furthermore, there
  seems little hope for an early end.</p>

  <p>Bourgeois ideologists have always justified the continuation of the capitalist mode
  of production on the basis that it proved its superiority over the older modes of
  exploitation, such as feudalism and its precursor, chattel slavery.</p>

  <p>The capitalist mode of production was in fact superior to the previous modes of
  exploitation in that it continually raised the level of the productive forces by an
  unending series of technological revolutions. On the basis of the continuous
  development of the productive forces the capitalist system of exploitation proved
  itself capable of the uninterrupted production of cheaper less costly commodities.</p>

  <p>It was able to do this by reducing the unit cost of a commodity, and was therefore
  able to make this cheaper commodity available to the world market, ultimately on the
  basis of mass production. Capitalism is said to be more efficient because it can reduce
  the unit cost (per socially necessary labor time) more effectively than any previous
  social system of production.</p>

  <p>It has been drilled into the heads of students and scholars alike and the broad mass
  of the workers as well that capitalism can outproduce all other systems because it can
  reduce the unit cost of a commodity or service. It does this not by reducing the wage
  level, but while, gradually increasing it, using technological and other labor-saving
  devices to make the commodity less costly, thereby serving the consumer and society as
  a whole.</p>

  <p>That is the principal rationalization for capitalist exploitation and imperialist
  oppression. According to this rationalization, it should not have been Laker Airways,
  it should have been one of the giant airlines, like Pan Am, TWA, or British Airways,
  that fell victim to the laws of capitalist development and the unrestricted reign of
  the free capitalist market.</p>

  <p>But this is not the dawn of capitalism, when the so-called free enterprise system
  was governed by the early forms of capitalist competition Dusk has enveloped this
  entire system and reigns on an international scale.</p>

  <p>Capitalist competition has degenerated into monopoly capitalism which knows only the
  competition of giant multi-nationals conglomerates and imperialist international
  cartels Cheaper products are only welcome if by chance they enhance rather than cut
  severely into the ever-growing extortionate profits which the monopolists wring out of
  society in general and the working class in particular.</p>

  <p><strong>Productive forces held back</strong></p>

  <p>The justification for the existence of the capitalist system rested on the fact that
  it was continually perfecting and developing the means of production, raising their
  level on a continuous and uninterrupted basis. This is no longer true.</p>

  <p>The vast resources of research and development of innovation and efficiency of
  scientific and technological personnel are being diverted into the destructive channels
  of military production. This erodes the very vitals of the civilian economy At the same
  time the civilian economy cannot detach itself or operate as a separate department from
  the military.</p>

  <p>Although civilian production, judged on the basis of overall gross national
  production is far more preponderant at the present time, it is the military-industrial
  complex which siphons off the cream of the crop from the civilian economy. The
  military-industrial complex engages the civilian economy in an altogether different
  direction than if the latter had full freedom to follow its own automatic
  processes.</p>

  <p><strong>Military distorts civilian economy</strong></p>

  <p>The banks, in conjunction with the aerospace industry and Big Oil, organically push
  for union with the military. The incentives for the development of the productive
  forces are thereby restricted and retarded. The productive forces grow only relatively
  compared to what would be possible if they were not chained to unbridled militarism and
  the private ownership of the means of production.</p>

  <p>Producing a commodity cheaper than a competitor was the watchword and criterion for
  the so-called progressiveness of the competitive stage of capitalism. One of the
  significant aspects in the subjugation of China in the pre-imperialist epoch was as
  Marx put it in the Communist Manifesto, "The capitalist West's cheap commodities were
  able to batter down the Chinese walls."</p>

  <p>Today the U.S. needs a flotilla of carriers, a fleet of bombers and fighters, and an
  endless string of air bases to force upon the oppressed people monopoly-priced
  commodities and fraudulent schemes for rapid industrialization which in reality
  destabilize the existing economy and ruin the possibilities for stable planned
  development.</p>

  <p><strong>Super-profit motive blocks capitalist regeneration</strong></p>

  <p>The supreme test of the viability of the capitalist system was that it could reduce
  the unit cost of a commodity or a service without open or hidden wage cutting. Instead,
  it raised the level of wages as a result of technological development and
  innovation.</p>

  <p>That has given way to reducing the wage level with givebacks, cuts in social
  services and a general decline in living standards in the interest of securing greater
  and greater super-profits. This is the new universal cure-all and panacea proposed and
  practiced by the Thatcherite-Reaganite program of economic contraction and military
  expansion.</p>

  <p>The collapse of the Laker experiment proves the inability of the imperialist economy
  to generate a new wave of capitalist development on the basis of new methods which are
  socially useful and economically viable, but run up against the motor force of
  capitalist super-profits.</p>

  <p>If monopoly capitalism could not tolerate even such an innovation as Laker's, which
  met all the standards usually set by capitalist theoreticians for the further
  development of capitalism, how then can it set in motion its resources to revive the
  worldwide deteriorating capitalist system-?</p>

  <p>Imperialism is becoming more and more a closed corporation on a transcontinental
  basis None but the innovators in the art of military destruction are given a cheerful
  welcome into the world imperialist community of bandits, cutthroats, and outright
  murderers.</p>

  <p>The innovators who are welcome are those who can help plan genocide in South Africa
  and in the Caribbean. At the same time, these innovators invariably pursue the path of
  trying to economically strangle the socialist countries, as witness Poland, and
  planning wars of destruction against all national liberation movements that seek to
  raise themselves to a full state of sovereignty, such as the heroic Palestinian
  people.</p>
