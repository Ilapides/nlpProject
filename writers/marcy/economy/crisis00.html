  <h5>Anatomy of the Economic Crisis [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Who today could deny that the capitalist world is in a generalized economic crisis.
  Whether measured by the level of unemployment, declining industrial output, the glut of
  commodities on the world market or the rise in bankruptcies and other business failures
  the painful evidence is everywhere. None of the capitalist countries is immune. Even
  the "West German miracle" has revealed its clay feet; the leading electronics firm AEG
  Telefunken recently declared bankruptcy.</p>

  <p>In these pages, a Marxist looks at the state of the capitalist economies. What you
  will find here, however, is not just an effort to fit contemporary events into Marxist
  categories. Rather, Sam Marcy approaches this subject with a scientific method; he
  proceeds from the <strong>specific to the general</strong> and not the other way
  around. He examines with great skill and knowledge the most striking features of
  contemporary economic developments, takes into account their historical evolution, and
  then proceeds to shed light on what the future holds.</p>

  <p>Besides holding up to analysis such not-so-minor cataclysms as the collapse of
  Drysdale Government Securities and Penn Square Bank, as well as the panic in the silver
  market several years ago, the author goes back in history to the early days of
  capitalist development. To show what features of the organism have been with it from
  the beginning, he calls to our attention Holland's speculative "tulip mania" of the
  seventeenth century.</p>

  <p>Marcy also draws on history to highlight what has changed in capitalist development.
  Why did the building of the Erie Canal spur industrial development in the Midwest,
  while the St. Lawrence Seaway a century later merely hasten its decline? Why was
  Freddie Laker undone by the same process that earlier made Henry Ford a kingpin of the
  auto industry? Marcy's contributions on these subjects are unique and eye-opening.</p>

  <p>But education as an end in itself is not the purpose of these writings. The author
  is an organizer in the workers' movement, concerned with the tactics of the class
  struggle. The section on the auto industry and the UAW contract speaks directly to the
  enormous problems faced by the workers when the bosses and the Reagan administration
  have gone on the offensive to shove the most humiliating and painful setbacks down
  their throats. These articles should help all workers gain a perspective on what
  strategies must be fought for in such a period.</p>

  <p>The articles in this book appeared originally in the weekly paper <em>Workers
  World.</em> In many ways they form a sequel to an earlier collection of articles by
  Marcy published under the title <em>Reindustrialization: The Menace Behind the
  Promise.</em></p>

  <p>The catastrophic events examined in these books appear to be breaking upon the
  people of the world with almost a preordained fatalism. But the deep conviction
  underlying Marcy's analysis is that those who make the effort to comprehend what is
  happening can make a great contribution to the struggle of the masses of people to turn
  the tables and take command of their own destiny, bringing down once and for all those
  destructive social and class relations that express themselves in the uncontrollable
  forces of the capitalist market.</p>
