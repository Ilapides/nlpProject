  <h3>Monopoly and the labor movement</h3>

  <h1><small>Chapter 6</small><br />
  The UAW crisis: The Ford contract</h1>

  <h4>February 18, 1982</h4>The auto industry accounts, directly or indirectly, for one
  out of every six jobs in the U.S. That takes in many millions of workers.

  <p>In that sense it is scarcely comparable to any other industry What happens in labor
  relations between the UAW and the auto barons, therefore, is of singular significance
  to millions of other workers.</p>

  <p>For many years the UAW set the pattern for other unions even those which don't enjoy
  the privileged position that auto workers have held for such a long time-until the
  present crisis.</p>

  <p><strong>Ford settlement affects millions</strong></p>

  <p>The concessions made by the UAW in its current contract with the Ford Motor Co., if
  ratified by the membership, are bound to influence many other unions, and will directly
  affect millions among the unorganized workers.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately after the ratification of the UAW Ford contract workers in the
  auto supply industries will be pressured most severely for similar if not greater
  concessions Of course in cases where the workers are weakly or not at all organized,
  the corporations will press for even more far-reaching demands.</p>

  <p>It is sometimes said that between 40 and 60 of manufacturing costs in the auto
  industry come from supplier products. These, of course, are the products made by other
  workers who are intimately linked to the fate of the UAW contract.</p>

  <p>Did the UAW leaders give ample consideration to the fact that in reality they were
  negotiating not only for the Ford workers, but perhaps for millions of others as
  well?</p>

  <p>It is impossible that the UAW leaders could have been unaware that reverberations
  from their concessions would affect millions of other workers.</p>

  <p><strong>UAW once won shorter work week</strong></p>

  <p>Aside from setting the pattern for other unions, the UAW has frequently been in the
  forefront in introducing innovations in its contracts that acted as spurs in the
  struggle to gain wider social benefits for the working class as a whole.</p>

  <p>For instance, in the 1979 UAW contract the union was able to win a provision with
  respect to personal paid holidays for the workers. Such a provision when implemented
  and extended, has great importance from the vantage point of widening social benefits
  that have historical significance.</p>

  <p>What is involved in this apparently unimportant innovation started by the UAW is
  that it tends to shorten the working time in the plant for the workers.</p>

  <p>It should be remembered that what originally gave an impetus to the development of
  the trade union movement in the U.S. on a national scale, which was later taken on
  worldwide by the working class, was the struggle for the eight-hour day. This was begun
  in the U.S. as a May Day demonstration. The struggle continued for many, many years
  until the eight-hour day became almost universally recognized as the standard for the
  workers for the entire historical period.</p>

  <p>In recent years, the demand for the 35-hour week has been raised in many unions. It
  was raised with particular vigor at successive UAW conventions.</p>

  <p>It therefore can scarcely be regarded as an accident that in the 1979 contract the
  UAW was finally able to win a provision for 26 paid personal holidays, or about nine
  per year.</p>

  <p>What social significance does this innovation have?</p>

  <p>It not only shortened the working time for each worker, but it also created jobs for
  others by the very act of shortening the work time. Thus when a worker is off another
  worker fills his or her particular spot.</p>

  <p><strong>New contract lengthens working time</strong></p>

  <p>The elimination of this provision of the contract not only lengthens the working
  time for the employed worker, but also facilitates the displacement of others and
  thereby creates a job loss.</p>

  <p>Estimates vary as to how many jobs will really be lost, but they number in the many
  thousands especially if GM workers go along with the same concession.</p>

  <p>In the light of history, the concession points to a wholly regressive trend which
  the working class fought to overcome decades ago. The lengthening of the work time was
  used as a weapon during the early phase of primitive capitalist accumulation when the
  capitalist system was most oppressive.</p>

  <p>The fact that both GM and Ford have singled out this particular provision for
  elimination forecasts an intention to roll back the social benefits of the working
  class in general to that very rudimentary stage of capitalist development the stage of
  primitive accumulation which was the Stone Age of capitalism.</p>

  <p>It would be a mistake to view this demand by the auto barons in strictly pragmatic
  terms. The loss that the workers will have to endure if the Ford contract is ratified
  admittedly amounts to $1 billion over a period of 31 bloody months.</p>

  <p>The loss of the personal paid holidays (PPH) in strictly financial terms appears
  rather insubstantial, if not minimal. What is significant, however, is the trend that
  it sets in motion &mdash; the lengthening of the work time which was abandoned decades
  ago by the ruling class after protracted struggle. It is now being reintroduced through
  the back door, so to speak.</p>

  <p>Promoting this concession encourages the reduction of vacation time, coffee breaks,
  etc., which again lengthens the working time. Unquestionably, employers will find even
  more devious ways, basing themselves on this precedent, for still further lengthening
  the working day and thus setting in motion a new reactionary cycle of social
  development that is wholly anti-working class in its character.</p>

  <p><strong>Job security provisions vague</strong></p>

  <p>The million-fold loss in monetary compensation that the Ford workers will suffer is
  of course the principal point of contention, along with the cutbacks and plant
  closings. The company has agreed in principle to hold these off in the form of a
  moratorium for two years.</p>

  <p>The tradeoff, however, is neither firm nor binding and is not really enforceable. It
  is all contingent, of course, on the company's "good faith" effort.</p>

  <p>It is this contingency which really vitiates the vague legalistic language employed
  in the contract. Were this otherwise the moratorium on plant closings and the language
  on out-sourcing would really be a breakthrough for the union.</p>

  <p>Not even the union leadership however including Fraser himself can make such a flat
  assertion.</p>

  <p>The greatest failure of the UAW leadership with respect to the struggle against the
  auto barons lies in their tardiness in recognizing the danger that had clearly revealed
  itself to them as long ago as July 1980.</p>

  <p>It was then that the auto magnates made known to the press that they were about to
  launch an unparalleled drive to restructure the industry and to invest unprecedented
  amounts of money on automation with thousands of robots and the most sophisticated
  technology overall.</p>

  <p><strong>$80 billion investment fund</strong></p>

  <p>An authoritative front-page article in the July 20, 1980, edition of the <em>New
  York Times</em> datelined Detroit disclosed that "the major auto manufacturers are
  expected to spend an astronomical $80 billion by 1985 to develop and produce cars and
  trucks.... To meet that goal they are redesigning nearly every part and component of
  their products and retooling every plant."</p>

  <p>It continues, "GM alone is spending at the rate of more than $1 million an hour and
  plans to do so for five years."</p>

  <p>This was public notice to the UAW that the industry had $80 billion available to it
  and would use it in such a way as to displace hundreds of thousands of auto workers and
  virtually reduce the union to a shell.</p>

  <p>This challenge by the auto monopolists had to be taken seriously and quickly. The
  UAW could not go on from day to day allowing the auto companies to lay off workers
  here, shut plants there, consolidate others, and in general create chaos among the
  workers in an effort to feather its own nest on the backs of the workers.</p>

  <p>At the time of the Chrysler crisis, it was the duty of the UAW leadership to make a
  unified stand and not allow its units to be picked off one by one; or worse still, to
  allow each division to do its own bargaining, thereby weakening and dispersing the
  union's strength.</p>

  <p>Each day lost since this public notice of July 1980 meant a continual, debilitating,
  and frustrating retreat-unless the union girded its loins, called a special convention
  by virtue of the statutory provisions in the constitution and demanded a halt to the
  auto magnates efforts at piecemeal destruction of the union through unilateral attempts
  at layoffs, cutbacks, and plant closings.</p>

  <p><strong>Move to unite labor</strong></p>

  <p>It would seem that for a while the UAW leadership did recognize the inherent threat
  to the membership as a whole when the UAW decided to rejoin the AFL-CIO. It seemed this
  was not merely an effort to strengthen political opposition to Reagan but to form a
  broad united front with the entire labor movement in order to ward off the threatening
  nationwide anti-labor offensive of the ruling class.</p>

  <p>The auto monopolists after all were merely the vanguard in a wholesale attempt to
  create a veritable counter-revolution in labor relations that would throw the working
  class back by decades. What the Reagan administration was doing politically, the ruling
  class as a whole was attempting to do in the private sector. This would surely be even
  more injurious in magnitude than the cutbacks in social services that the Reaganite
  budget was pushing forward.</p>

  <p>The UAW's struggle with the auto barons cannot be fought on a traditionally narrow
  single-company or single industry basis. It must be recognized as a national effort by
  the ruling class which is dead earnest in its attempt to turn the clock back.</p>

  <p><strong>Lessons of earlier recessions</strong></p>

  <p>Compare the situation now to what it was in 1907908 when Henry Ford first brought
  out his Model T car. The year was one of severe recession. It culminated in a panic in
  the financial markets.</p>

  <p>The contraction of the economy, that began in May 1907 and continued to June 1908,
  although relatively brief, was extremely severe and involved a sharp drop in industrial
  output, causing much unemployment.</p>

  <p>The economic crisis of 1907908 is considered the most severe of the capitalist
  cyclical crises up to the great crash of October 1929 Important to remember by way of
  comparison with today's situation is that it was the innovation of mass production,
  with the introduction of the Model T car, which began to lift the capitalist economy
  out of its crisis and brought about a significant recovery.</p>

  <p>It was the contribution of mass production and, as we said in our earlier article,
  the reduction in price of the Model T car from $950 in 1909 to $360 in 1916 and an
  astonishing $290 in 1926 which was responsible for making the U.S. auto industry the
  principal producer on a world scale, enabling the U.S. to achieve mastery of the world
  market.</p>

  <p>The dead hand of full-blown monopoly capitalism had not yet fully enveloped the
  entire auto industry or fully integrated it into its worldwide network of finance
  capital. Of course, Ford ultimately fell victim to this inexorable process.</p>

  <p>The Ford contribution of mass production demonstrated that it was possible to raise
  wages and increase employment while winning staggering markets for the sale of millions
  upon millions of cheap Model Ts.</p>

  <p>What the magnates of this day and age have in mind is a totally different historic
  process. Instead of low-priced products, they favor keeping prices high over the years
  as an expression of their lust for super-profits, even at the cost of unemployment and
  lower wages.</p>

  <p>Complying today with these demands of the auto barons would constitute a virtual
  counter-revolution in labor relations Is this what the auto union leaders are about to
  inaugurate by pushing the Ford contract as the initial step on such a perilous
  road?</p>

  <p><strong>UAW should focus on $80 billion fund</strong></p>

  <p>Rather than being mesmerized, confused, and frightened by the seemingly enormous
  losses of several billion dollars claimed by the auto monopolists, the union leadership
  should instead focus its attention on the truly gargantuan size of the funds available
  to the auto barons which are in the magnitude of $80 billion, as authoritatively
  estimated by the New York Times.</p>

  <p>This has been a century of the most stupendous technological developments in
  manufacturing we now live in an age of electronics, computerization, and satellites,
  when scientific discovery and invention makes it possible to apply high technology in
  the production of virtually limitless wealth. Yet the auto barons can do nothing better
  with their $80 billion investment fund than continually raise the already extortionate
  prices for automobiles, while at the same time creating unprecedented unemployment! Is
  this not an unfailing sign of the auto barons' socially parasitic character and their
  economic and political bankruptcy?</p>

  <p>The auto barons are planning to use the 80 billion investment fund destructively
  against the workers and against society. The UAW leadership therefore have an
  obligation to declare themselves the trustees of this investment fund and to utilize it
  under the democratic control of the workers on behalf of production for use, for full
  employment, and ultimately to facilitate the complete ownership by the workers of all
  the means of production.</p>

  <p>The auto leaders, and the workers too, have a responsibility to the working class as
  a whole. What happens in auto is bound to have a domino effect in labor relations
  generally.</p>

  <p>For each union to go its own separate way, at a time when the ruling class is
  hell-bent on pushing through a nationwide anti-labor offensive is not only thoughtless
  but completely self-defeating.</p>

  <p>The hour for rethinking the whole strategy is late indeed. But it is most
  urgent.</p>

  <p>There is still time to abandon the path of surrender and defeatism and return to the
  heroic days when the UAW was the real vanguard in the struggle against the mighty
  corporations in the historic battles of the 1930s.</p>
