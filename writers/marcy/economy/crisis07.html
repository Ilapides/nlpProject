  The UAW crisis: Is Ford really broke?</h1>

  <h4>March 2, 1982</h4>

  <p>Of all the dramatic developments which have convulsed the auto industry and the
  United Auto Workers (UAW) union, the most interesting is precisely the one which has
  received the least publicity. It goes to the very heart of the problem facing the
  UAW.</p>

  <p>When the UAW rank and file voted to give up $1 billion from their wages in
  concessions for the company, they did so in the shadow of the highly publicized $1.06
  billion which Ford supposedly lost last year. The UAW concessions and the savings to
  the company, it was also widely publicized, were to enable Ford to modernize its plants
  and thus achieve greater sales.</p>

  <p>Lost somewhere in the company's long explanation and multitude of figures regarding
  its losses was a rather inconspicuous item regarding Ford's financial standing during
  the year. According to David Healy, an analyst for the investment firm of Drexel
  Burnham Lambert Inc., a major factor contributing to last year's poor performance was a
  loss of 576 million mostly sustained while converting British pounds and West German
  marks from its European operations into dollars.</p>

  <p>According to this authority, these currency losses by Ford "masked a real upswing in
  overseas operations" (New York Times, Feb. 19, 1982).</p>

  <p>What does it mean in relation to the Ford contract? It is first necessary to
  translate the confusing financial jargon into plain language.</p>

  <p>The financial losses of the auto industry, which the UAW union leadership has
  focused so heavily on, are overblown and not put in the perspective of the truly
  tremendous assets which the industry has available to it.</p>

  <p>As we pointed out in an earlier article, the auto industry has available a truly
  extraordinary sum &mdash; $80 billion &mdash; which it can invest or use to modernize
  as it sees fit. The losses of the industry when compared to this truly staggering sum
  are really negligible. This 80 billion investment fund was authoritatively disclosed in
  an article in the New York Times as long ago as July 20, 1980.</p>

  <p>But even not counting this huge amount, the publicized loss of $1.06 billion is
  exaggerated.</p>

  <p><strong>How multi-nationals profit from currency manipulation</strong></p>

  <p>As this investment firm clearly shows there was an upswing in production in Ford
  operations which would have shown a profit had it not been for currency manipulations
  and the loss of $576 million on the currency market. How do such things happen?</p>

  <p>A vivid example was seen on February 18, 1982, when the Mexican government announced
  that it had devalued the peso by 30%. Here's how this works: If you had a dollar on
  February 17, you could have bought 26.8 pesos for that dollar; after February 18, if
  you had a dollar you were entitled to get 38.5 pesos to the dollar. The peso thus got
  cheaper in relation to the dollar.</p>

  <p>If you were a Ford executive and had to meet a payroll at a Ford facility in Mexico,
  of which there are several, you would have to pay the workers in pesos. For the same
  dollar that you purchased 26.8 pesos with last week, you could now get 38.5 pesos.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Ford executives paid out less in dollars than previously. If the payroll
  was 1 million after a 30% devaluation of the peso you gained 30% on the dollar, perhaps
  as much as $300,000. And the workers, in reality, suffered a wage cut.</p>

  <p>Since the currencies of oppressed countries have been unstable and subject to
  devaluations, especially since the Second World War, the U.S. multi-national
  corporations stand to make huge profits. Aside from anything else, this is an incentive
  for the multi-national corporations to not only go after the natural resources of
  oppressed countries but to generally entrench themselves in the world currency market
  so as to be able to transfer dollars from one country to another in order to enhance
  profits.</p>

  <p>And this can be done most effectively because of the predominance of the U.S. dollar
  despite worldwide capitalist recession and its deep and profound effects in the
  U.S.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that on February 23 some of the European capitalist
  countries, weakened by the deepening economic crisis, devalued their currencies. The
  Belgian franc was devalued by 3%, and the Danish krone followed suit. The Irish
  government seems on the brink of doing likewise. And the nervousness among the British,
  French, Germans, and Italians is becoming steadily more intense.</p>

  <p>The question of whether another round of devaluations will occur is not far from the
  calculations of the West European and Japanese capitalist governments.</p>

  <p>What further significance does this have for the Ford contract, aside from the fact
  that if a currency war breaks out in Europe it could considerably diminish and even
  reverse Ford's alleged financial losses?</p>

  <p>What does it mean from the point of view of the bread-and-butter issues which face
  the auto workers in the U.S.?</p>

  <p><strong>The parasitism of exporting money capital</strong></p>

  <p>Giant multi-national corporations like Ford, Chrysler, and GM have at their disposal
  truly vast sums of money. They invest these sums not merely in production facilities
  abroad, out-sourcing, etc. They have also accumulated over the years huge sums in the
  form of "retained earnings," a code word for profits. They use this money at will, to
  invest throughout the world in so-called capital appreciation, i.e., currency
  speculation.</p>

  <p>The huge conglomerates that are spread over the whole capitalist globe are engaging
  in a form of capital export which Lenin pointed out as long ago as 1917 was a parasitic
  development characteristic of monopoly capitalism.</p>

  <p>In the pre-imperialist epoch, the export of commodities, that is of useful things,
  was the principal characteristic of capitalist trade and commerce. Today, however, it
  is the export, not so much of commodities, of useful things, which is primary, but the
  export of money capital.</p>

  <p>It is so much easier to make a killing by currency manipulation like some of the
  multi-national corporations just did in Mexico than it is to make profits by exporting
  commodities It is easier for Ford GM and Chrysler to transfer the vast funds which they
  hold abroad from one country to another and make huge profits than it is to sell U.S.
  cars abroad.</p>

  <p>And it is even more perilous for the auto monopolies to construct an assembly plant
  or a parts plant abroad due to political conditions which are dangerous to U.S.
  imperialism although the potential profits there are still enormous.</p>

  <p>The easiest and quickest way to make the biggest profits lies precisely in exporting
  capital in money form, loaning it out transferring it back and forth through monetary
  manipulation and playing the currency exchanges where billions of dollars can be made
  or lost overnight. This is what enhances the profits of the largest corporations
  together with the biggest banks.</p>

  <p>Benjamin J. Stein, writing in the February 28, 1982, New York Times Magazine,
  estimates that the U.S. has $200 billion in loans outstanding in the underdeveloped
  countries. The auto and banking industries have no small sum in this huge amount.</p>

  <p>The $80 billion available to the auto corporations is only a small part of a huge
  pool of capital which is floating on a world scale.</p>

  <p><strong>Capital goes to where profits are greatest</strong></p>

  <p>Capital has an undeviating tendency to gravitate to where the rate of profit is
  highest. It breaks down legal and national barriers with virtual immunity. It owes no
  loyalty to nationality, has no moral principles, uproots the national cultures of
  oppressed people, and is concerned least of all with the plight of the workers who have
  to endure untold suffering as a result of its devastating operations.</p>

  <p>Capital on wings soars day and night. The multi-nationals or, more accurately, the
  transnational corporations, have billions of dollars in numberless banks. They are
  spread over the seven continents and are particularly active throughout the European
  money market through the use of what are called Eurodollars.</p>

  <p>At any one time, the multi-nationals transfer funds not merely from one bank to
  another but from one country to another deriving advantage from one currency's
  devaluation as in Mexico losing some as perhaps in Belgium but over all making
  lucrative and extortionate profits on the basis of evading taxes at home and engaging
  in currency manipulation and devious currency transfers abroad.</p>

  <p>In 1972, there was close to 800 billion worth of Eurofunds of which the auto funds
  then represented a small part. Today, with declining profits at home, the auto money
  has flown abroad where the profits are greatest.</p>

  <p>It should therefore be no surprise that the $80 billion auto investment sum is not,
  as advertised, destined mainly for the modernization of plant and equipment. The
  gravitational pull on auto and banking generally is from another direction. This
  development is highly parasitic, adventuristic to the extreme and dangerous to the very
  shaky stability of the entire capitalist system.</p>

  <p><strong>UAW-Ford contract not mere tactical retreat</strong></p>

  <p>It is in this world context that one has to view the auto industry, and the UAW-Ford
  contract in particular. It can not be viewed as if it were the early 1930s or even the
  1940s.</p>

  <p>The UAW-Ford contract, which was signed on March 1, 1982, is an ominous sign of
  regression. The leadership conned the rank and file into finally surrendering more than
  a billion dollars to "save" the company, without giving a clear exposition of the real
  nature of the retreat.</p>

  <p>Tactical retreats by the leadership in times of ordinary capitalist recessions are
  well understood by most workers throughout the world. But what distinguishes the
  retreat of the UAW is that the leadership is pursuing a path that is not only ruinous
  for the union membership but sets a precedent and a pattern which is wholly destructive
  for the future.</p>

  <p>One can easily understand a driver of an automobile taking a particularly dangerous
  curve but doing so with a very definite destination in mind.</p>

  <p>This is not so with the UAW leadership. They took a dangerous curve in the road, but
  they do not know where to go from there.</p>

  <p>It is not just the $1 billion that they have freely given to the company along with
  so many other concessions which will only come to light after production starts. It is
  the fact that the auto barons are in the midst of pondering what course they themselves
  will take-or rather will be pulled along by their investments.</p>

  <p>UAW militants have to take a broad view concerning the course which the capitalist
  worldwide crisis is pushing on the ruling class in order to be able to orient the auto
  workers and the working class as a whole in a progressive direction.</p>

  <p>The gravitational pull from the parasitic export of money capital as part and parcel
  of the blind chase after superprofits is only one aspect of a twofold process of decay
  in auto, steel, and other industries which are being devastated by the capitalist
  recession.</p>

  <p>There is still another pull which is more ominous and eventually more
  catastrophic.</p>

  <p><strong>Why Chrysler sold its most profitable division</strong></p>

  <p>The announcement by the Chrysler Corporation that it is selling its lucrative and
  highly profitable military tank division got scant if not perfunctory notice in the
  capitalist press. It was mostly covered in the financial pages.</p>

  <p>The sale of a very lucrative and highly profitable division by a virtually bankrupt
  corporation is in itself a most unusual and extraordinary development.</p>

  <p>The tank division was probably one of the few sources for a possible recovery of the
  Chrysler Corporation, if that's what its directors were seeking to attain. Selling it
  at what appears to be a meager price is cutting the company off from its only
  <strong>certain</strong> lucrative investment (guaranteed by the Pentagon).</p>

  <p>Such practices in the ordinary course of business transactions would be regarded as
  nothing less than collusion compounded by corruption of one sort or another.</p>

  <p>How could this happen with the seeming consent of all parties concerned-Chrysler,
  the government, and the esteemed president of the UAW who sits on the Chrysler board
  and presumably has a vote on it? Is it not unusual that there should be such unanimity
  where there are usually so many conflicts based on divergent material interests?</p>

  <p>Was there not even a single obstreperous dissenting stockholder who would venture to
  test the dubious validity of this unusual transaction?</p>

  <p>In the course of ordinary business transactions an injunction would have been
  obtained almost immediately and the sale stopped.</p>

  <p>But nothing like this happened, nor is it likely to.</p>

  <p><strong>Civilian economy being swallowed up by military</strong></p>

  <p>The sale of the Chrysler military tank division to General Dynamics, a giant octopus
  within the military-industrial complex, is highly indicative of a growing trend. This
  has been long evident ever since General Dwight D. Eisenhower's famous memorandum of
  1946 validating the establishment of the military-industrial complex Eisenhower also
  warned about the perils this posed for the capitalist system as a whole in his farewell
  address before leaving the presidency.</p>

  <p>What does the sale mean in terms of the social evolution of the military-industrial
  complex in relation to civilian industry particularly auto?</p>

  <p>The military sector tends to gobble up the latter, to squeeze out its vitality, to
  reduce it to an appendage of the military behemoth.</p>

  <p>Thus the autoworkers, along with the rest of the working class, are faced with this
  two-pronged gravitational pull by finance capital. One is the destructive economic
  consequences of the parasitic export of money capital. The other is the ever-growing
  encroachments of the military-industrial complex.</p>

  <p>Each of these two prongs of finance capital is devastating in its effects and tends
  in an economically destructive and militarily catastrophic direction.</p>

  <p><strong>Union must take over investment fund</strong></p>

  <p>The failure of the UAW leaders to view the $80 billion investment fund of the auto
  corporations as a security fund that comes from the labor of the workers and is part
  and parcel of their earnings ignores the fundamental reality of the relationship
  between capital and labor, between the exploiters and the exploited.</p>

  <p>The correct tactic for the UAW is not merely to address itself to the individual
  employer but to the industry as a whole. It is wrong to focus in on the losses of the
  auto corporations while disregarding the $80 billion investment fund which properly
  belongs to the workers and which affords a solution at least in part to their
  problems.</p>

  <p>The union should sit in jurisdiction over the money and have a say on where and how
  to spend or utilize the allocation of funds. By not directing itself to this the UAW
  loses sight of the most fundamental question Directing the union's attention to the
  wage and benefit problems alone vital as they are, is like trying to stop a leak in a
  cabin when the ship is headed straight in the direction of an iceberg.</p>

  <p>As matters turned out with the Ford contract, the choice that the workers were faced
  with was not a real one. They were constrained to do what Fraser and the ruling class
  had long conditioned them for.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to construct a program for the auto workers without directing the
  attention of all the workers to the gargantuan investment fund available to the auto
  barons. This, in reality, is labor time wrung out of the workers over years and years.
  It belongs to them. Fighting for it will lead the workers to take a broader view
  concerning the whole course of the capitalist worldwide crisis, which the auto crisis
  is only one aspect.</p>

  <p>What the Frasers and their ilk are proposing in the space age is no better and has
  far less justification than the practices of the early Luddites who disrupted
  production during the early phase of capitalist development.</p>

  <p>Nothing less than a radical reevaluation of the UAW's strategy in the light of the
  fundamental problems posed above can lead to a truly progressive solution to the
  mounting problems confronting the UAW and the working class as a whole.</p>
