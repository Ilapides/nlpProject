  The animal factory revolution</h1>

  <h4>March 9, 1982</h4>

  <p>A great agricultural revolution has been sweeping the industry for several years but
  has received scant popular exposure Agribusiness and the giant chemical and
  pharmaceutical complexes have conspired to maintain a low profile for what obviously is
  a tremendous industrial development.</p>

  <p>The high profits that will accrue to agribusiness and the chemical-pharmaceutical
  complex are enormous. The dangers for animal and human life are perhaps equally as
  enormous and explain the low profile for this significant development. It should also
  be noted that this new agricultural revolution holds potentially great advantages in
  the production of food and the alleviation of hunger on a world scale.</p>

  <p><strong>New revolution on the land</strong></p>

  <p>This agricultural revolution is perhaps akin to the two great earlier revolutions in
  agriculture. The first one took place many thousands of years ago with the introduction
  of draft animals, which greatly increased the food supplies in the world. The second
  great agricultural revolution was the use of the modern tractor which multiplied food
  production on a national and world scale at least for most of the industrialized
  countries of the world.</p>

  <p>The latter did, of course, displace a tremendous amount of small farms decreasing
  the farm population in this country The steady decline of the working population on the
  farms which began early in the 20th century has never stopped, but has continued at a
  galloping pace to this day.</p>

  <p>The revolution in animal factory production has some of the fundamental features of
  mass production in the automobile industry Mass production introduced and developed by
  Henry Ford came into existence at the very beginning of the age of monopoly capitalism
  but before finance capital had drawn auto and other industries cornpletely into its
  vortex.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, mass production in autos was able to tremendously increase the
  volume of auto production. Autos began rolling off the assembly line by the millions.
  Mass production reduced the unit cost per auto while at the same time
  <strong>increasing</strong> the number of auto workers and <strong>increasing their
  wage level.</strong> It thus proved, for a short period, the progressive character of
  this new method of capitalist production-before the decline began and the now decadent
  state of the industry.</p>

  <p><strong>'Confinement feeding'</strong></p>

  <p>The new revolution in agricultural production is most typified by the factory
  production of hogs and other animals. The revolution is based on the rapid application
  of a <strong>particular</strong> method of mass production on the farm. This is known
  as confinement feeding of animals.</p>

  <p>This method can only be used by the very big farmers, mostly farm corporations. It
  allows them to raise many thousands of hogs in very enclosed, extremely small areas. it
  is most prevalent in the Midwest, in such high-producing areas as Iowa Hog production
  is therefore being systematically industrialized in farming.</p>

  <p>The confinement buildings have floors of concrete or plastic slats which allow the
  urine and manure to run through to the holding pits below. Mechanical systems suck the
  excrement from the pits to tanks. Then it is trucked to fields and spread as
  fertilizer. Heating and cooling systems keep the temperature at about 80 degrees in the
  summer in the farrowing unit and ward off extremes of hot and cold in other units.</p>

  <p>Should the electrical power for the confinement units break down, there is supposed
  to be an alarm system which triggers a telephone alert, notifying personnel of the
  danger.</p>

  <p>The technological systems introduced to sustain the confinement of animals are the
  most important innovation. Another is the steady growth of automated feeding of animals
  and the use of complex water systems. Many antibiotics and other drugs are necessary
  for the raising and development of cattle stock in close confinement. And highly
  specialized systems are used to remove urine and manure.</p>

  <p>The steady and consistent growth of the industry has spread out and encompassed not
  only pork but beef and poultry production. All are becoming increasingly specialized
  and highly concentrated.</p>

  <p><strong>Farmers dependent on banks</strong></p>

  <p>It need hardly be stated that the increased concentration of this capitalist
  industry not only increases the size of the undertakings but reduces the number of
  necessary farmers. They must not only have considerable sums of money available, but
  also be able to obtain the indispensable credit from banks. The latter have to extend
  these loans in order to make large-scale feeding units manageable and possible.</p>

  <p>The so-called independent farmer today probably needs $500,000 to establish the
  units necessary for this latest development in mechanization. It requires a breeding
  and gestation building, a farrowing unit where pigs give birth and where pigs stay
  until they are weaned after four weeks, a nursery facility where pigs stay until they
  reach 100 pounds, and a finishing unit where they are kept until they reach marketing
  weight of 210-220 pounds.</p>

  <p>According to a <em>New York Times</em> article of August I 1, 1980, one proprietor,
  assisted by a full-time hired man and two high school youths, said the unit allows him
  to market about 6,000 hogs a year. Under the old method, he could only market 3,000 a
  year!</p>

  <p>It goes without saying that these new methods of production have tremendously
  increased the sum total of animal production, not only of hogs, but of cattle and
  chickens.</p>

  <p><strong>'New corporate peons'</strong></p>

  <p>The decline in the number of small farms has been catastrophic The existence of a
  large number of so-called independent proprietors has in fact become so closely
  dependent upon the large chemical and pharmaceutical corporations and the banks that
  they often speak of themselves as the "new corporate peons."</p>

  <p>The lot of the working farmers, and the agricultural workers in particular
  especially migrant workers has become most perilous.</p>

  <p>Unlike the two great previous agricultural revolutions &mdash; from manual labor to
  draft animals and the introduction of the modern tractor &mdash; this revolution poses
  dangers to both animals and humans.</p>

  <p>There's no question that the tractor caused tremendous social havoc by displacing
  and driving the farming population into the cities. The present revolution however
  poses an additional hazard.</p>

  <p><strong>Prices skyrocket</strong></p>

  <p>The latest developments in animal factory production have not only reduced the size
  of the workforce, unlike what happened with mass production in auto at the early stage.
  <strong>They have also failed to cause, certainly not until now, any reduction in the
  unit cost of animal production.</strong></p>

  <p>The growth of the productive forces and a reduction in the unit cost of production
  &mdash; without reducing the wage level of the workers &mdash; would demonstrate the
  progressive character of the industry by making agricultural products more available to
  the masses of the people. However, what has taken place is just the opposites &mdash; a
  steady increase in price of food over a period of years.</p>

  <p>The consistent and ever-increasing introduction of pharmaceuticals chemicals and all
  sorts of mechanical and technological devices to develop the system has not reduced the
  unit price in the cost of production. The principal reason for it is the highly
  monopolized character of the industries on which the new agricultural revolution is
  dependent. In reality agriculture has become an appendage of agribusiness and the giant
  pharmaceutical-chemical complex not to speak of the giant banks which fund them.</p>

  <p><strong>Scattered character of agriculture was easy prey for monopolies</strong></p>

  <p>The auto industry's ability to introduce mass production and reduce the unit price
  of the automobile was due in part to the fact that the Ford Motor Company had available
  its own sources of supplies and raw materials.</p>

  <p>The automobile manufacturers at the time numbered between 25 and 30, with perhaps as
  many more in embryonic development. This is practically nothing compared to the
  scattered character of agriculture in general. There were originally millions of
  farmers, all conducting business on an individual basis.</p>

  <p>The scattered character of agriculture has made it an easy prey for giant
  monopolized industry in general. The monopolies barred the road to lowering the cost of
  agricultural commodities in general and processed food in particular.</p>

  <p>The tremendous potential benefit to humanity of mass production, especially in a
  country which has such an abundance of natural resources, is inhibited and highly
  restricted by the phenomenon of finance capital in cooperation with the chemical and
  huge drug corporations. It has also raised great health dangers.</p>

  <p><strong>Health hazards</strong></p>

  <p>The health hazards which this new agricultural revolution is bringing about are
  enormous. The warnings of individual writers, journalists and experts in the field have
  been pooh-poohed. Industry magazines such as Beef and National Hog continue to sing
  paeans of praise for the great achievements of the industry and underplay the
  hazards.</p>

  <p>Veterinarians agronomists and the many scientific personnel employed in the
  universities of the country which deal with agricultural development are funded by the
  great corporate monsters and leave little room for objective analysis of the health
  hazards.</p>

  <p>One of the few truly significant exposes of the health hazards was the book by Jim
  Mason and Peter Singer (<em>Animal Factories,</em>, Crown Publishers). The authors show
  that crowding of animals into these confinement areas not only causes stress but germ
  buildup filthy air and other conditions which invite disease.</p>

  <p>The confinement system often causes digestive disorders in the animals, including
  ulcers and chronic water and bowel movements in some animals like calves Vitamin
  deficiencies in chickens which are common in poultry factories result in a variety of
  problems like heart damage blindness lethargy kidney damage bone and muscle weakness,
  and so on. This does not exhaust, by any means, the health hazards involved in an area
  which holds such great potential in other ways.</p>

  <p><strong>Closed confinement not only method</strong></p>

  <p>In the first place, it is necessary to invalidate and destroy the myth cultivated by
  agribusiness and the chemical-pharmaceutical complex that the closed confinement aspect
  of the production process is the only method for introducing the mass production of
  animals in this country.</p>

  <p>The element of closed confinement quarters, which is central to this system, is
  completely suspect. It does not grow out of a planned, let alone pre-planned, system of
  mass production. It is just one possible system out of many.</p>

  <p>It is suspect because the confinement principle was a response not to highly
  sophisticated and new technological developments but to the skyrocketing price of land
  resulting from the raging inflation. It should be obvious to all that this new system
  arose only in the last few years &mdash; at the very height of inflation and land
  speculation.</p>

  <p>It is not a logical outgrowth of engineering processes and sophisticated
  technological developments. There may be an abundance of other systems.</p>

  <p>The efforts of agribusiness and the chemical-farm complex to present it as the sole
  and exclusive method is sheer fraud.</p>

  <p>The development of the confinement system also has very significant foreign policy
  implications. The confinement system of mass production was developed at a time when
  prices were steadily rising in an inflationary wave. Introducing the system at the time
  and continuing it was a form of economic warfare against Argentina, Australia, and the
  European Common Market.</p>

  <p>The origin of this scheme is based on artificial factors and by no stretch of the
  imagination on any thought for the human needs of the people, let alone a humane
  attitude toward the animals.</p>

  <p><strong>Collusion of USDA</strong></p>

  <p>This system was made possible by the fact that when it was first initiated on a mass
  scale the U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA under Earl Butz who served under the
  Nixon administration until he was ousted for his outlandishly racist remarks closed its
  eyes to the onerous aspects of this development and gave it the green light.</p>

  <p>The Department is charged with the responsibility for the health and safety of the
  people. What the government was obliged to do was to put the burden of proof on
  agribusiness to demonstrate that theirs was the sole and exclusive method possible,
  that no other method was available, and that a scarcity of the food supply existed
  which made it necessary.</p>

  <p>None of this was attempted.</p>

  <p>In truth, the USDA has been a servile instrument of agribusiness and the
  chemical-drug complex.</p>

  <p>If the industry was recalcitrant and proved difficult to combat, it was incumbent
  upon the government to do what other government agencies were finally forced to do in
  the struggle against the utilities several decades ago. It was the government which
  erected the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), not only to increase electrical energy,
  which was necessary to make fertile areas out of barren land, but to prove that
  electrical power could be produced at lower costs.</p>

  <p>As we said, there was no alternative plan presented by agribusiness or the
  government as against this onerous and cruel development. Even pilot programs, which
  often give a measure of the efficacy of a new system, were, to the best of our
  knowledge, not presented.</p>

  <p>The large concentration of animals into very small areas is not a necessary aspect
  of mass production. The essential ingredient of any mass production system is the
  ability to introduce low-cost products by extensive use of automatic machinery and a
  minute division of labor.</p>

  <p>The system that we described above is merely one type of system, which is crude,
  onerous, and lacks sophistication. When one thinks of the hundreds of thousands of many
  minute and delicate mechanisms which have been developed for the space and electronic
  industries the use of the confinement method for animals is positively
  antediluvian.</p>

  <p><strong>The public interest</strong></p>

  <p>Furthermore, the public interest is completely disregarded.</p>

  <p>No public intervention or protest on a significant scale has taken place against the
  government to compel the banker-industrial complex to take into consideration the human
  interest.</p>

  <p>Consider the fact that a multi-billion-dollar development corporation in New York
  City decided to establish a modern hotel in the heart of New York on 42nd Street at
  Grand Central. Purchasing it was easy considering the immense sums available to the
  developers. And they were ready almost immediately with bulldozers to demolish what
  many regarded as a valuable historic landmark &mdash; Grand Central.</p>

  <p>There was a small protest by interested groups. The horde of corporate servitors in
  the form of engineers, architects, etc., snowed the group with charts, plans, and all
  sorts of imaginary engineering obstacles which "proved" that building the hotel was
  "absolutely impossible" if the landmark remained.</p>

  <p>But as the protests escalated and more and more people who knew something about the
  development business got involved, the hordes of engineers, architects, etc., soon
  enough found a way to both retain the landmark and at the same time build around
  it!</p>

  <p>If this could be done on an issue which is, after all, very small by comparison with
  the development of the agricultural revolution and its onerous consequences, then
  certainly mass intervention, first of all by the interested elements from the
  profession itself, could begin to turn the tide and show up the industry.</p>

  <p>It is only <strong>struggle</strong> which can make the agrochemical complex look up
  and listen.</p>

  <p>It should be taken into account by progressives in this field that it is precisely
  during a deep capitalist recession, like the present one, that all of capitalist
  industry is engaged in formulating plans to alter methods of production and refurbish
  new technological systems.</p>

  <p>Capitalist recessions are the so-called slack seasons which give the capitalists an
  opportunity to go over and review their industrial systems of operation. And it is also
  the best time to vigorously advance alternatives to the so-called confinement system as
  the sole and exclusive means for mass production.</p>

  <p><strong>Today's 'jungle'</strong></p>

  <p>Many decades ago, Upton Sinclair, in a well-known novel of the time, <em>The
  Jungle,</em> described analogous conditions in the stockyards of Chicago. It caused an
  immediate sensation in the country. The government immediately intervened with an
  investigation which ultimately resulted in some progressive legislation based upon
  inspection and supervision.</p>

  <p>No such outcry has greeted the still meager but growing literature on the health
  hazards in factory animal production of which Mason and Singer's book is one of the
  very best.</p>

  <p>The grip of monopoly retards social progress, impedes technological development,
  permitting only its relative growth where profit is easily maximized, and disregards
  the hazards to the ecological system as a whole as does, for instance, nuclear energy.
  In terms of health hazards, the new agricultural revolution which holds such great
  promise in augmenting the food supply for a growing population is also akin to the
  nuclear industry.</p>

  <p>Do we here in the U.S. now need an agricultural version of the Three Mile Island or
  Love Canal catastrophes to awaken the public?</p>

  <p>Many progressive animal scientists veterinarians agricultural engineers and farm
  experts in the specialized fields where technology and its application to agriculture
  are so important, frequently blame the mere chase for high productivity, efficiency,
  and the general urge for growth of technology as the causes for the acceleration of
  health hazards to life and limb. They should not stop there however Nor should they
  commiserate as some do on the rapid growth and proliferation of technology in all
  fields of endeavor and even refer to it as the "cancer of growth."</p>

  <p><strong>Need political offensive</strong></p>

  <p>It is necessary to mount a broad political offensive which includes not merely an
  exposure of the evils of the agrochemical complex but a consistent exposure of the USDA
  and the government and carefully prepared alternatives as part of mobilizing public
  opinion.</p>

  <p>The USDA should not be left to make decisions alone, especially of an administrative
  character, which deal with such important aspects of the life of the people. It is
  necessary to bring in the broad public as an indispensable factor.</p>

  <p>Instead of administrative decisions made by appointed underlings of the USDA, juries
  of the people should sit and listen to the scientific evidence presented by the
  industry. Commensurate financial and technical resources should be made available for a
  public prosecutor to present evidence on behalf of the people, the consumers. They, and
  they alone can make the necessary decisions based upon conflicting evidence presented
  by the industry and the people's prosecutor.</p>

  <p>There are hundreds of well-known criminal cases involving murder where complex
  scientific evidence presented by the prosecutor and the defense is carefully analyzed
  and correct verdicts made (except, of course, in cases of outright fraud or frame-up).
  The judgment of the people in making these verdicts is a thousand times more credible
  than the "unvarnished truths presented by the likes of the agrochemical business.</p>

  <p><strong>Private ownership is root of problem</strong></p>

  <p>While all the writings of the Progressives in this field are very well-meaning, and
  their contribution of detailed and exhaustive research especially important what is
  overlooked is not just the chase for super-profits.</p>

  <p>What is rarely if ever mentioned is that it is not the character of large-scale
  production or the ever-increasing acceleration in the development of sophisticated
  technology in all fields of endeavor which is the problem, it is <strong>the incubus of
  private ownership of the basic means of production</strong> which is absolutely the
  principal cause of all the calamities which the capitalist system of production
  continues to visit upon humanity.</p>

  <p>Private property in the basic means of production, which was at one time a promoter
  of progress, has turned into a reactionary obstruction. Indeed, as we reach the end of
  the 20th century, the contributions of capitalism, once the most revolutionary in the
  history of humanity, have turned from life savers into virtual killers.</p>
