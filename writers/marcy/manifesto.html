  <h1>The Communist Manifesto</h1>

  <h2>A clarion call full of ideas</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy</h5>

  <p><em>From unpublished notes written in 1983.</em></p>

  <p>Of all the great classics in the treasury of Marxism, <a href=
  "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/"><em>The Communist
  Manifesto</em></a> unquestionably stands out as the most popular and widely read
  throughout the world. Bourgeois ideologists, even the most virulent opponents of
  Marxism, never fail to be astonished by the persistent attraction the Manifesto has for
  each new generation of revolutionary militants.</p>

  <p>The Manifesto, written by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in 1848, is a creative
  revolutionary synthesis of propaganda and agitation, as these terms were originally
  defined by George Plekhanov when he was still a revolutionary Marxist.</p>

  <p>"Propaganda" was then understood as the presentation of many complex ideas to a
  small group of people, while "agitation" was conceived as the presentation of a few
  ideas or a single idea to a large audience. Of course, there&rsquo;s no wall between
  the two.</p>

  <p>The Manifesto illuminates a great number of complex ideas.</p>

  <p>It presents the materialist conception of history in clear, brilliant language. It
  traces the history of the class struggle from its earliest days to 1848. It analyzes
  the rise of the bourgeoisie, explains its revolutionary role &mdash; and not only
  analyzes the intermediate classes in bourgeois society, but also mercilessly exposes
  the nature of capitalist exploitation and oppression as it had never been done
  before.</p>

  <p>The Manifesto&rsquo;s diagnosis of capitalist society is at the same time a
  prognosis of the destruction of capitalism at the hands of what the Manifesto calls the
  "grave diggers" of capitalism &mdash; the revolutionary proletariat.</p>

  <p><strong>Not just a critique but a guide to action</strong></p>

  <p>Far from being merely a criticism of feudal and bourgeois society, the Manifesto
  thus unequivocally points the way to the revolutionary overthrow of the
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Manifesto subjects to critical analysis the nature of the
  capitalist state, as well as the role of the family, religion and culture.</p>

  <p>Above all, in tracing the development of the proletariat from its earliest days in
  mere handicraft production to its role in large-scale industry by 1848, the Manifesto
  points to the "proletariat alone as the really revolutionary class" and the historic
  agent for constituting a new social order, free of exploitation or oppression.</p>

  <p>All of this is <em>propaganda</em> &mdash; irreplaceable working-class propaganda.
  Yet at the same time it is also revolutionary <em>agitation</em> of the highest order.
  It fans the flames of revolution.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, the Manifesto directs itself toward presenting a succinct, coherent
  and lucid exposition of the basic principles of Marxism. To that extent, it directs
  itself to "the few" &mdash; not necessarily the middle class, but the advanced sections
  of the working class.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, with its ringing call to overthrow the oppressors and exploiters,
  the Manifesto addresses itself directly to the broadest and widest sections of the
  working class.</p>

  <p>It is this dialectical unity of opposites &mdash; propaganda and agitation &mdash;
  so skillfully blended together that makes the Manifesto such a monumental
  achievement.</p>

  <p>Nothing could be a more crystal-clear call to the proletariat than the final
  paragraph of the Manifesto.</p>

  <p>It ends with this ringing call to action:</p>

  <p>"Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their
  ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.
  Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have
  nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.</p>

  <p>"Workingmen of all countries, unite!"</p>

  <p>Such a mighty clarion call for revolutionary worldwide action by the proletariat has
  yet to be surpassed.</p>

  <p>Marx and Engels were not unaware that the working class was a narrow segment of
  society at the time the Manifesto was written. As Engels said in the 1890 preface to a
  Polish edition of the Manifesto, "Few voices responded to &lsquo;Workingmen of all
  countries, unite!&rsquo; when we proclaimed these words to the world ... on the eve of
  the first Paris revolution in which the proletariat came out with demands of its
  own."</p>

  <p>However, wrote Engels, "On Sept. 28, 1864, the proletarians of most of the Western
  European countries joined hands in the International Workingmen&rsquo;s Association."
  And even though that International &mdash; the first attempt at a world organization of
  the proletariat &mdash; lasted only a few years, said Engels, it left a glorious
  heritage.</p>

  <p><strong>National chauvinism vs. internationalism</strong></p>

  <p>Just prior to the start of World War I, the working-class movement in Europe, under
  the leadership of the Social Democratic parties, reached the zenith of its authority
  over the broadest masses on the continent. Immediately after the outbreak of the war,
  however, the movement was virtually smashed as a result of the betrayal by the Social
  Democratic leadership.</p>

  <p>The adherents of revolutionary Marxism &mdash; in reality the adherents of the
  principles enunciated by the Manifesto &mdash; were temporarily reduced to a small
  minority. The majority had succumbed to chauvinism. They had forgotten one of the
  principal tenets in the Manifesto: that the workers in a capitalist country have no
  fatherland. "The workingmen have no country. We cannot take from them what they have
  not got."</p>

  <p>The Social Democratic leaders&rsquo; surrender to chauvinism cost the proletariat
  dearly in World War I: millions upon millions of lives lost and untold devastation and
  destruction.</p>

  <p>Nothing so much arouses the prejudices of the bourgeois ideologists, nothing so much
  enrages them and exposes their deep-seated chauvinism, as the question of "patriotism,"
  the "defense of the national interest." Today, more than ever, this invariably means
  the defense of the capitalist state and giant finance capital.</p>

  <p>Any lie, any falsification will do to corrupt, vulgarize and distort the real
  meaning and significance of the defense of one&rsquo;s country, as it was understood
  both in Marx&rsquo;s time and in the imperialist epoch.</p>

  <p>Marx and Engels had written extensively about the autonomy and unity of each nation.
  It is well known that they had fought for the independence of Poland, Hungary, Ireland
  and Italy. Engels wrote in 1893 in a preface to the Italian edition of the Manifesto
  that the defeat of the 1848 revolutions resulted in "the fruits of the revolution being
  reaped by the capitalist class."</p>

  <p>"Through the impetus given to large-scale industry in all countries," he wrote, "the
  bourgeois regime during the last 45 years has everywhere created a numerous,
  concentrated and powerful pro letariat. It has thus raised, to use the language of the
  Manifesto, its own grave-diggers."</p>

  <p>Engels then added this remarkable thought, as pertinent today as it was then:
  "Without restoring autonomy and unity to each nation, it will be impossible to achieve
  the international union of the proletariat, or the peaceful and intelligent cooperation
  of these nations toward common aims."</p>

  <p>The progressive epoch of the bourgeoisie in the struggle against feudalism &mdash;
  especially the period when Marx was writing &mdash; demonstrated a trend toward
  diminishing national differences and antagonisms. It was due to the development of the
  bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world market.</p>

  <p>The subsequent evolution into monopoly capitalism diverted this trend. Indeed,
  capitalism has not been able to carry out a single one of its economic trends to its
  ultimate conclusion.</p>

  <p>The classical example of this is the failure of the various trusts and combinations,
  through the process of competition, to be converted into total monopoly and become a
  worldwide trust or "super imperialism," which Karl Kautsky thought would abolish the
  anarchy of capitalism.</p>

  <p>As industrial and technological development grows by leaps and bounds, monopoly
  capitalism, rather than narrowing national differences and ameliorating national
  oppression, exacerbates them. It is no wonder that the bourgeois world is literally
  divided into oppressing and oppressed nations.</p>

  <p>But this does not at all disqualify the class struggle. It merely imparts a greater
  urgency for the revolutionary cooperation and solidarity of all the workers in both the
  oppressing and oppressed nations &mdash; in a common struggle against imperialism,
  capitalism and all forms of bourgeois reaction and feudal rubbish left by centuries of
  oppression.</p>

  <p>The revolutionary contribution of the bourgeoisie, as Marx explained, was in
  developing the world market, which has "given a cosmopolitan character to production."
  This has greatly increased the strategic role of the working class in production and in
  relation to the class struggle.</p>

  <p>Marx&rsquo;s words are even more true today: "In place of the old local and national
  seclusion and self-sufficiency," the bourgeoisie has tremendously enhanced "intercourse
  in every direction, universal interdependence of nations."</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie cannot create even the semblance of world unity, despite the obvious
  foundations laid by the gargantuan growth of the productive forces and the ensuing
  economic interdependence.</p>

  <p>Only the proletariat in alliance with the oppressed peoples and the socialist
  countries can lay the political and social foundations for worldwide solidarity. This
  is precisely because only socialism, which is based on planning and the common
  ownership of the means of production, can purge the worldwide market of its imperialist
  chaos, its unpredictable crises, and the reign of the arbitrary based on
  superprofits.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the world market, as Marx said, "makes national one-sidedness and
  narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible." It inevitably generates proletarian
  class solidarity &mdash; the truest basis for bringing about the solidarity of the
  human race.</p>
