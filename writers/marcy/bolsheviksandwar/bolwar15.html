  War proclamation &amp; program, Socialist Party (April,
  1917)</h1>

  <h3>War proclamation and program adopted at the National Convention of the
  Socialist Party of the United States, St. Louis, Mo., April 1917</h3>

  <p>The Socialist Party of the United States in the present grave crisis solemnly
  reaffirms its allegiance to the principle of internationalism and working-class
  solidarity the world over, and proclaims its unalterable opposition to the war just
  declared by the Government of the United States.</p>

  <p>Modern wars as a rule have been caused by the commercial and financial rivalry and
  intrigues of the capitalist interests in the different countries. Whether they have
  been frankly waged as wars of aggression or have been hypocritically represented as
  wars of "defense," they have always been made by the [ruling] classes and fought by the
  masses. Wars bring wealth and power to the ruling classes, and suffering, death, and
  demoralization to the workers.</p>

  <p>They breed a sinister spirit of passion, unreason, race hatred, and false
  patriotism. They obscure the struggles of the workers for life, liberty, and social
  justice. They tend to sever the vital bonds of solidarity between them and their
  brothers in other countries, to destroy their organizations and to curtail their civic
  and political rights and liberties.</p>

  <p>The Socialist Party of the United States is unalterably opposed to the system of
  exploitation and class rule which is upheld and strengthened by military power and sham
  national patriotism. We therefore call upon the workers of all countries to refuse
  support to their governments in their wars. The wars of the contending national groups
  of capitalists are not the concern of the workers. The only struggle which would
  justify the workers in taking up arms is the great struggle of the working class of the
  world to free itself from economic exploitation and political oppression, and we
  particularly warn the workers against the snare and delusion of so-called defensive
  warfare. As against the false doctrine of national patriotism we uphold the ideal of
  international working class solidarity. In support of capitalism we will not willingly
  give a single life or a single dollar; in support of the struggle of the workers for
  freedom we pledge our all.</p>

  <p>The mad orgy of death and destruction which is now convulsing unfortunate Europe was
  caused by the conflict of capitalist interests in the European countries.</p>

  <p>In each of these countries, the workers were oppressed and exploited. They produced
  enormous wealth but the bulk of it was withheld from them by the owners of the
  industries. The workers were thus deprived of the means to repurchase the wealth which
  they themselves had created.</p>

  <p>The capitalist class of each country was forced to look for foreign markets to
  dispose of the accumulated "surplus" wealth. The huge profits made by the capitalists
  could no longer be profitably reinvested in their own countries, hence, they were
  driven to look for foreign fields of investment. The geographical boundaries of each
  modern capitalist country thus became too narrow for the industrial and commercial
  operations of its capitalist class.</p>

  <p>The efforts of the capitalists of all leading nations were, therefore, centered upon
  the domination of the world markets. The acquisition of colonial possessions and the
  extension of spheres of commercial and political influence became the object of
  diplomatic intrigues and the cause of constant clashes between nations.</p>

  <p>The acute competition between the capitalist powers of the earth, their jealousies
  and distrusts of one another and the fear of the rising power of the working class
  forced each of them to arm to the teeth. This led to the mad rivalry of armament,
  which, years before the outbreak of the present war, had turned the leading countries
  of Europe into armed camps with standing armies of many millions, drilled and equipped
  for war in times of "peace." Capitalism imperialism and militarism had thus laid the
  foundation of an inevitable general conflict in Europe. The ghastly war in Europe was
  not caused by an accidental event, nor by the policy or institutions of any single
  nation. It was the logical outcome of the competitive capitalist system.</p>

  <p>The 6,000,000 men of all countries and races who have been ruthlessly slain in the
  first 30 months of this war, the millions of others who have been crippled and maimed,
  the vast treasures of wealth that have been destroyed, the untold misery and sufferings
  of Europe, have not been sacrifices exacted in a struggle for principles or ideals, but
  wanton offerings upon the altar of private profit.</p>

  <p>The forces of capitalism which have led to the war in Europe are even more hideously
  transparent in the war recently provoked by the ruling class of this country.</p>

  <p>When Belgium was invaded, the government enjoined upon the people of this country
  the duty of remaining neutral, thus clearly demonstrating that the "dictates of
  humanity," and the fate of small nations and of democratic institutions were matters
  that did not concern it. But when our enormous war traffic was seriously threatened,
  our government calls upon us to rally to the "defense of democracy and
  civilization."</p>

  <p>Our entrance into the European War was instigated by the predatory capitalists in
  the United States who boast of the enormous profit of $7 billion from the manufacture
  and sale of munitions and war supplies and from the exportation of American food stuffs
  and other necessaries. They are also deeply interested in the continuance of war and
  the success of the Allied arms through their huge loans to the governments of the
  Allied powers and through other commercial ties. It is the same interests which strive
  for imperialistic domination of the Western Hemisphere.</p>

  <p>The war of the United States against Germany cannot be justified even on the plea
  that it is a war in defense of American rights or American "honor." Ruthless as the
  unrestricted submarine war policy of the German government was and is, it is not an
  invasion of the rights of the American people as such, but only an interference with
  the opportunity of certain groups of American capitalists to coin cold profits out of
  the blood and sufferings of our fellow men in the warring countries of Europe.</p>

  <p>It is not a war against the militarist regime of the Central Powers. Militarism can
  never be abolished by militarism.</p>

  <p>It is not a war to advance the cause of democracy in Europe. Democracy can never be
  imposed upon any country by a foreign power by force of arms.</p>

  <p>It is cant and hypocrisy to say that the war is not directed against the German
  people, but against the Imperial Government of Germany. If we send an armed force to
  the battlefields of Europe, its cannon will mow down the masses of the German people
  and not the Imperial German Government.</p>

  <p>Our entrance into the European conflict at this time will serve only to multiply the
  horrors of the war, to increase the toll of death and destruction and to prolong the
  fiendish slaughter. It will bring death, suffering, and destitution to the people of
  the United States and particularly to the working class. It will give the powers of
  reaction in this country the pretext for an attempt to throttle our rights and to crush
  our democratic institutions, and to fasten upon this country a permanent
  militarism.</p>

  <p>The working class of the United States has no quarrel with the working class of
  Germany or of any other country. The people of the United States have no quarrel with
  the people of Germany or any other country. The American people did not want and do not
  want this war. They have not been consulted about the war and have had no part in
  declaring war. They have been plunged into this war by the trickery and treachery of
  the ruling class of the country through its representatives in the National
  Administration and National Congress, its demagogic agitators, its subsidized press and
  other servile instruments of public expression. We brand the declaration of war by our
  government as a crime against the people of the United States and against the nations
  of the world.</p>

  <p>In all modern history there has been no war more unjustifiable than the war which we
  are about to engage.</p>

  <p>No greater dishonor has ever been forced upon a people than that which the
  capitalist class is forcing upon this nation against its will.</p>

  <p>In harmony with these principles, the Socialist Party emphatically rejects the
  proposal that in time of war the workers should suspend their struggle for better
  conditions. On the contrary, the acute situation created by war calls for an even more
  vigorous prosecution of the class struggle, and we recommend to the workers and pledge
  ourselves to the following course of action:</p>

  <p>1. Continuous, active, and public opposition to the war through demonstrations, 1.
  Continuous, active, and public opposition to the war through demonstrations, mass
  petitions, and other means within our power.</p>

  <p>2. Unyielding opposition to all proposed legislation for military or industrial 2.
  Unyielding opposition to all proposed legislation for military or industrial
  conscription. Should such conscription be forced upon the people we pledge ourselves to
  continuous efforts for the repeal of such laws and to the support of all mass movements
  in opposition to conscription. We pledge ourselves to oppose with all our strength any
  attempt to raise money for payment of war expense by taxing the necessaries of life or
  issuing bonds which will put the burden upon future generations. We demand that the
  capitalist class, which is responsible for the war, pay its cost. Let those who kindled
  the fire, furnish the fuel.</p>

  <p>3. Vigorous resistance to all reactionary measures such as censorship of press 3.
  Vigorous resistance to all reactionary measures such as censorship of press and mails,
  restriction of the rights of free speech, assemblage, and organization, or compulsory
  arbitration and limitation of the right to strike.</p>

  <p>4. Consistent propaganda against military training and militaristic teaching in 4.
  Consistent propaganda against military training and militaristic teaching in the public
  school.</p>

  <p>5. Extension of the campaign of education among the workers to organize them 5.
  Extension of the campaign of education among the workers to organize them into strong,
  class-conscious, and closely unified political and industrial organizations to enable
  them by concerted and harmonious mass action to shorten this war and to establish
  lasting peace.</p>

  <p>6. Widespread educational propaganda to enlighten the masses as to the true 6.
  Widespread educational propaganda to enlighten the masses as to the true relation
  between capitalism and war, and to rouse and organize them for action, not only against
  present war evils, but for the prevention of future wars and for the destruction of the
  causes of war.</p>

  <p>7. To protect the masses of the American people from the pressing danger of 7. To
  protect the masses of the American people from the pressing danger of starvation which
  the war in Europe has brought upon them, and which the entry of the United States has
  already accentuated we demand --</p>

  <blockquote>
    (a) The restriction of food exports so long as the present shortage continues, the
    fixing of maximum prices and whatever measures may be necessary to prevent the food
    speculators from holding back the supplies now in their hands;<br /><br />

    (b) The socialization and democratic management of the great industries concerned
    with the production, transportation, storage, and the marketing of food and other
    necessaries of life;<br /><br />

    (c) The socialization and democratic management of all land and other natural
    resources now held out of use for monopolistic or speculative profit.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>These measures are presented as means of protecting the workers against
  the evil results of the present war. The danger of recurrence of war will exist as long
  as the capitalist system of industry remains in existence. The end of wars will come
  with the establishment of socialized industry and industrial democracy the world over.
  The Socialist Party calls upon all the workers to join it in its struggle to reach this
  goal, and thus bring into the world a new society in which peace, fraternity, and human
  brotherhood will be the dominant ideals.
