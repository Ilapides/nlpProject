  <h1><small>Appendix X</small><br />
  Decree on Peace by Second All-Russia Congress of
  Soviets</h1>

  <p>The workers' and peasants' government, created by the Revolution of October 24-25
  and basing itself on the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants' Deputies, calls
  upon all the belligerent peoples and their governments to start immediate negotiations
  for a just, democratic peace.</p>

  <p>By a just or democratic peace for which the overwhelming majority of the working
  class and other working people of all the belligerent countries, exhausted, tormented,
  and racked by the war, are craving -- a peace that has been most definitely and
  insistently demanded by the Russian workers and peasants ever since the overthrow of
  the czarist monarchy -- by such a peace the government means an immediate peace without
  annexations (i.e., without the seizure of foreign lands, without the forcible
  incorporation of foreign nations) and without indemnities.</p>

  <p>The Government of Russia proposes that this kind of peace be immediately concluded
  by all the belligerent nations and expresses its readiness to take all the resolute
  measures now, without the least delay, pending the final ratification of all the terms
  of such a peace by authoritative assemblies of the people's representatives of all
  countries and all nations.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the sense of justice of democrats in general, and of the working
  class in particular, the government conceives the annexation or seizure of foreign
  lands to mean every incorporation of a small or weak nation into a large or powerful
  state without the precisely, clearly and voluntarily expressed consent and wish of that
  nation irrespective of the time when such forcible incorporation took place,
  irrespective also of the degree of development or backwardness of the nation forcibly
  annexed to the given state or forcibly retained within its borders, and irrespective
  finally of whether this nation is in Europe or in distant overseas countries.</p>

  <p>If any nation whatsoever is forcibly retained within the borders of a given state,
  if, in spite of its expressed desire -- no matter whether expressed in the press, at
  public meetings, in the decisions of parties, or in protests and uprisings against
  national oppression -- it is not accorded the right to decide the forms of its state
  existence by a free vote taken after the complete evacuation of the troops of the
  incorporating or generally of the stronger nation and without the least pressure being
  brought to bear, such incorporation is annexation, i.e., seizure and violence.</p>

  <p>The government considers it the greatest of crimes against humanity to continue this
  war over the issue of how to divide among the strong and rich nations the weak
  nationalities they have conquered and solemnly announces its determination immediately
  to sign terms of peace to stop this war on the terms indicated, which are equally just
  for all nationalities without exception. At the same time the government declares that
  it does not regard the above-mentioned peace terms as an ultimatum; in other words, it
  is prepared to consider any other peace terms, and insists only that they be advanced
  by any of the belligerent countries as speedily as possible and that in the peace
  proposals there should be absolute clarity and the complete absence of all ambiguity
  and secrecy.</p>

  <p>The government abolishes secret diplomacy, and, for its part, announces its firm
  intention to conduct all negotiations quite openly in full view of the whole people. It
  will proceed immediately with the full publication of the secret treaties endorsed or
  concluded by the government of landowners and capitalists from February to October 25,
  1917 The government proclaims the unconditional and immediate annulment of everything
  contained in these secret treaties insofar as it is aimed, as is mostly the case, at
  securing advantages and privileges for the Russian landowners and capitalists and at
  the retention or extension of the annexations made by the Great Russians.</p>

  <p>Proposing to the governments and peoples of all countries immediately to begin open
  negotiations for peace the government, for its part, expresses its readiness to conduct
  these negotiations in writing, by telegraph, and by negotiations between
  representatives of the various countries or at a conference of such representatives. In
  order to facilitate such negotiations the government is appointing its plenipotentiary
  representative to neutral countries.</p>

  <p>The government proposes an immediate armistice to the governments and peoples of all
  the belligerent countries and for its part considers it desirable that this armistice
  should be concluded for a period of not less than three months, i.e. a period long
  enough to permit the completion of negotiations for peace with the participation of the
  representatives of all peoples or nations, without exception, involved in or compelled
  to take part in the war, and the summoning of authoritative assemblies of the
  representatives of the peoples of all countries for the final ratification of the peace
  terms.</p>

  <p>While addressing this proposal for peace to the governments and people of all the
  belligerent countries, the Provisional Workers and Peasants Government of Russia
  appeals in particular also to the class-conscious workers of the three most advanced
  nations of humanity and the largest states participating in the present war, namely,
  Great Britain, France, and Germany. The workers of these countries have made the
  greatest contributions to the cause of progress and socialism; they have furnished the
  great examples of the Chartist movement in England, a number of revolutions of historic
  importance effected by the French proletariat, and, finally, the heroic struggle
  against the Anti-Socialist Law in Germany and the prolonged, persistent, and
  disciplined work of creating mass proletarian organizations in Germany, a work which
  serves as a model to the workers of the whole world. All these examples of proletarian
  heroism and historical creative work are a pledge that the workers of the countries
  mentioned will understand the duty that now faces them of saving humanity from the
  horrors of war and its consequences, that these workers by comprehensive, determined,
  and supremely vigorous action, will help us to conclude peace successfully, and at the
  same time emancipate the laboring and exploited masses of our population from all forms
  of slavery and all forms of exploitation.</p>

  <p>The workers and peasants government, created by the Revolution of October 24-25 and
  basing itself on the support of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants'
  Deputies, must start immediate negotiations for peace. Our appeal must be addressed
  both to the governments and to the peoples. We cannot ignore the governments, for that
  would delay the possibility of concluding peace, and the people's government dare not
  do that; but we have no right not to appeal to the peoples at the same time. Everywhere
  there are differences between the governments and the peoples, and we must therefore
  help the peoples to intervene in questions of war and peace. We will, of course, insist
  upon the whole of our program for a peace without annexations and indemnities. We shall
  not retreat from it, but we must not give our enemies an opportunity to say that their
  conditions are different from ours and that therefore it is useless to start
  negotiations with us. No, we must deprive them of that advantageous position and not
  present our terms in the form of an ultimatum. Therefore the point is included that we
  are willing to consider any peace terms and all proposals. We shall consider them, but
  that does not necessarily mean that we shall accept them. We shall submit them for
  consideration to the Constituent Assembly which will have the power to decide what
  concessions can and what cannot be made. We are combating the deception practiced by
  governments which pay lip-service to peace and justice, but in fact wage annexationist
  and predatory wars. No government will say all it thinks. We, however, are opposed to
  secret diplomacy and will act openly in full view of the whole people. We do not close
  our eyes to difficulties and never have done. War cannot be ended by refusal, it cannot
  be ended by one side. We are proposing an armistice for three months but shall not
  reject a shorter period so that the exhausted army may breathe freely even if only for
  a little while; moreover, in all the civilized countries national assemblies must be
  summoned for the discussion of the terms.</p>

  <p>In proposing an immediate armistice we appeal to the class-conscious workers of the
  countries that have done so much for the development of the proletarian movement. We
  appeal to the workers of Britain, where there was the Chartist movement, to the workers
  of France, who have in repeated uprisings displayed the strength of their
  class-consciousness, and to the workers of Germany, who waged the fight against the
  Anti-Socialist Law and have created powerful organizations.</p>

  <p>In the Manifesto of March 14, we called for the overthrow of the bankers, but, far
  from overthrowing our own bankers, we entered into an alliance with them. Now we have
  overthrown the government of the bankers.</p>

  <p>The governments and the bourgeoisie will make every effort to unite their forces and
  drown the workers' and peasants' revolution in blood. But the three years of war have
  been a good lesson to the masses -- the Soviet movement in other countries and the
  mutiny in the German navy, which was crushed by the officer cadets of Wilhelm the
  hangman. Finally, we must remember that we are not living in the depths of Africa, but
  in Europe, where news can spread quickly.</p>

  <p>The workers' movement will triumph and will pave the way to peace and socialism.</p>
