  <h1><small>Chapter 6</small><br />
  The Green Corn Rebellion and the struggle for
  socialism</h1>

  <p>The anti-war struggles of the past in the U.S. have not always been mere protest
  movements of a passive character composed mainly of middle class elements and the
  youth. Those earlier struggles against wars of U.S. imperialism were altogether
  different, particularly the movement against the first imperialist world war of
  1914-1918.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter is that at that time the struggles had mainly a working
  class and socialist character. Opposition to the war took on many forms and was often
  militant in character resorting to direct action and armed resistance. Opposition to
  the draft was widespread, and took on massive proportions in many of the cities of the
  U.S.</p>

  <p>To understand the character of the militant opposition to the war, it is necessary
  to know that the socialist movement in general and the Socialist Party in particular
  were very strong. The Socialist Party had become a truly mass party of the working
  class as it existed at the time.</p>

  <p>Historians sometimes allude to the 1912 elections as the high point of mass
  socialist activity in the U.S. Still others assert that the movement increased its
  relative strength in relation to the capitalist parties even in 1916, when the Wilson
  administration and the capitalist government had already had several years to inculcate
  a vicious jingoism and chauvinism in preparation for U.S. intervention into the
  imperialist war.</p>

  <p>The socialist movement had a splendid press at the time. James Weinstein, in his
  book <em>The Decline of Socialism in America, 1912-1925,</em> <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>
  <a name="ret1" id="ret1"></a> estimates that total circulation of the socialist press
  exceeded two million copies in 1913. There were several weekly and monthly newspapers
  with a national circulation, as well as daily and weekly local papers. There were also
  trade union papers with a socialist perspective and a considerable number of foreign
  language socialist dailies and weeklies, in addition to cultural and theoretical
  magazines.</p>

  <p>The <em>International Socialist Review,</em> it should be noted, had a truly
  international reputation and was widely read. The <em>Appeal to Reason,</em>the
  Socialist Party's principal organ, had an average weekly circulation of 761,747; the
  <em>National Rip-Saw,</em> 150,000; and so on.</p>

  <p>From far-off czarist Russia, Lenin hailed the growth in the circulation of the
  <em>Appeal to Reason.</em> "The latest issue of the American labor weekly <em>Appeal to
  Reason</em> reports that its circulation has increased to 984,000 copies," Lenin wrote
  in "The Successes of the American Workers", and he went on to quote from a current
  issue " 'The letters and demands coming in,' writes the editor (No. 875, Sept. 7),
  'indicates beyond doubt that we shall exceed one million copies in the next few weeks.'
  " <a href="#fn2">[2]</a> <a name="ret2" id="ret2"></a></p>

  <p>The election of 1912 gave the Socialist standard bearer, Eugene Debs, the largest
  vote ever -- 897,000, or 6% of the national total. When one considers that this was at
  a time when Black people were virtually disenfranchised and when women could not vote,
  the election results are of considerable political significance in the working class
  history of the U.S.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't only in the national elections for president that the party showed its
  influence. It also came through in many city and state elections.</p>

  <p>About 1,200 socialists were elected to public office in 343 municipalities
  throughout the country, including 79 mayors in 24 states. Two socialist congressmen,
  Victor Berger from Wisconsin and Meyer London from New York, were elected, although
  London was never seated.</p>

  <p>With this as background, it is easy to see that it was mainly socialist and working
  class organizations which conducted the anti-war struggle at that time, making it part
  and parcel of the struggle against capitalism.</p>

  <p>There were few demonstrations or anti-war struggles which were not conducted under
  the banner of socialist agitation against capitalism. In this respect the anti-war
  movement of that period differs fundamentally from the later movement of the 1960s
  during the Viet Nam war.</p>

  <p>We have already described how the outbreak of the imperialist war in Europe caught
  all the socialist parties of the world by surprise. They were particularly demoralized
  to learn that the European parties had by and large capitulated on the question of
  participation in imperialist war and joined their own capitalist governments in world
  slaughter.</p>

  <p>However, as we said earlier, not all the socialist parties renounced their fidelity
  to socialist internationalism. The Serbian, Bulgarian, and Italian parties opposed the
  war, and the stand of the Bolshevik Party in Russia is well known. And it is
  significant that the Socialist Party of the U.S. condemned the war at the outset.</p>

  <p>Eugene Debs, the party's presidential candidate who was later jailed for opposing
  the war, wrote in 1915: "I am not a capitalist soldier; I am a proletarian
  revolutionist. I do not belong to the regular army of the plutocracy, but to the
  irregular army of the people. I refuse to obey any command to fight from the ruling
  class. I am opposed to every war but one; I am for that war with heart and soul, and
  that is the world-wide war of the social revolution."</p>

  <p>It is true, however, that the Socialist Party as a whole faltered to some extent in
  the period between the outbreak of the war in Europe and the historic St. Louis
  convention of April 1917. But by and large it conducted tremendous mass meetings and
  demonstrations against the war, and continued an aggressive electoral campaign right up
  to and including the war years.</p>

  <p>Pacifist organizations such as the American Union Against Militarism and the
  American Peace Society had little if any influence. However, in response to the
  socialist and working class movement, workers and farmers were opposed to the war.</p>

  <p>John Hays Hammond, a prominent Republican and mining engineer, told an annual
  meeting of the National Civic Federation in January 1917, "Some influence or
  combination of influences has brought about a weakening of the patriotic spirit in this
  country when we find that neither the working man nor the farmers -- the two great
  groups upon which our national life depends -- are taking any part or interest in the
  efforts of the security or defense leagues or other movements of national
  preparedness." <a href="#fn3">[3]</a> <a name="ret3" id="ret3"></a></p>

  <p>The combination of influences which Hammond refers to by innuendo is that of the
  working class and socialist agitation which was becoming ever more widespread in the
  period, taking hold of a large mass of the population.</p>

  <p>It took a great effort on the part of the Wilson administration to "turn the country
  around." It was done with a variety of methods, even including fraudulent incidents
  like the sinking of the Lusitania (a civilian passenger ship secretly loaded with
  munitions, making it a prime target of German attack) and a vicious campaign of
  jingoism in the capitalist press.</p>

  <p>The Wilson administration resorted to arrest, indictment, and imprisonment of
  thousands of socialist anti-war agitators in an effort to silence the movement. It
  struck out against the many socialist and working class papers and magazines by
  revoking their second-class mailing rights, thereby making it financially extremely
  difficult for them to continue to publish.</p>

  <p>Utilizing the so-called Espionage Act the Wilson administration inaugurated a period
  of witch-hunting which in many respects exceeded that of the McCarthy period of the
  1950s. Nevertheless, the movement was not cowed. It continued to fight on and in some
  areas became more aggressive than ever.</p>

  <p>One key election in 1917 showed the temper of the ruling class press and the kind of
  opposition to the war which continued despite repression. Commenting on the forthcoming
  election, the <em>New York World,</em> a liberal daily, had this to say, "Today's
  election will determine whether New York is a traitor town, a quasi-copperhead town, or
  an American town devoted to American ideals and pledged without reservation to the war
  policies of the U.S. government." <a href="#fn4">[4]</a> <a name="ret4" id=
  "ret4"></a></p>

  <p>While this was directed at the Democratic candidate, who had a wishy-washy attitude
  toward the war, the brunt of the attack was against Morris Hillquit, the Socialist
  candidate. The interesting thing about the election is that Hillquit nevertheless
  received 21%, a large increase over the usual socialist vote.</p>

  <p>In addition several Socialist aldermen and ten assemblymen were elected. These
  results were a stunning blow to the Wilson administration, especially after all the
  hysteria the government and press had whipped up, the repression, and the jailing of
  prominent leaders such as Debs and other outspoken anti-war figures. Anti-capitalist
  propaganda continued to be strong and widespread, notwithstanding the defection of
  middle class intellectuals, writers and publicists.</p>

  <p>More than during the later period of McCarthyism and the Korean War, the witch-hunt
  of the Wilson administration met resistance. Nor was this response confined to Eastern
  cities like New York, as is sometimes presumed. On the contrary, the more militant
  opposition came from the Western and Central states as well as the South.</p>

  <p>The Socialist Party's declaration against the war as embodied in the main resolution
  of its St. Louis convention of April 1917 was representative of a broad and growing
  section of the working class that was opposed to the war and capitalist exploitation.
  It was not merely a paper resolution embodying the thinking of a small, isolated sector
  of the population. On the contrary, it gave voice to the most viable section of the
  working class.</p>

  <p>This resolution opens: "The Socialist Party of the United States in the present
  grave crisis solemnly reaffirms its allegiance to the principle of internationalism and
  working-class solidarity the world over, and proclaims its unalterable opposition to
  the war just declared by the government of the United States."</p>

  <p>After characterizing all modern wars as being only for the benefit of the
  capitalists, the resolution continues: "The Socialist Party of the United States is
  unalterably opposed to the system of exploitation and class rule which is upheld and
  strengthened by military power and sham national patriotism. We therefore call upon the
  workers of all countries to refuse support to their governments in their wars. The wars
  of the contending national groups of capitalists are not the concern of the workers.
  The only struggle which would justify the workers in taking up arms is the great
  struggle of the working class of the world to free itself of economic exploitation and
  political oppression, and we particularly warn the workers against the snare and
  delusion of so-called defensive wars." <a href="#fn5">[5]</a> <a name="ret5" id=
  "ret5"></a></p>

  <p>The resolution was approved by a huge majority. But there was also a considerable
  minority of 50 opposed to the forthright anti-imperialist position taken at the St.
  Louis convention. They basically reflected the fear, intimidation, hysteria, and
  chauvinism manufactured by the capitalist press and the Wilson administration. But
  while chauvinism and capitulationism were growing in some areas as a result of the
  pressures exerted by the capitalist class, in other areas socialists took an entirely
  different cue in the struggle against the war.</p>

  <p>Some took the road of arming themselves to resist. This took place in several areas,
  especially in the South. Socialists were arrested in Dallas, Texas, for possession of
  arms. In North Carolina, farmers in Chatham County organized an armed revolt against
  the draft. Outside Toledo, Ohio, someone fired on a troop train. These were scattered
  and unorganized efforts against the war, often not well directed. However, one very
  significant and dramatic struggle, really an armed rebellion, took place in the heart
  of Oklahoma.</p>

  <p>The Green Corn Rebellion of August 1917 was a genuine working class attempt at an
  anti-war insurrection in what had formerly been called the Indian Territory of
  Oklahoma. It had in its ranks mostly poor tenant farmers, dispossessed people who had
  been forced off their land, and former railroad workers who had lost their jobs when
  the railroad strike led by Debs was broken in the 1890s. Among the participants were
  many Black people as well as Native people from the Seminole nation.</p>

  <p>The rebellion was organized by the Working Class Union, the left wing of the
  Socialist movement in Oklahoma and Arkansas. It had a strong affinity if not direct
  ties to the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a syndicalist union movement which
  also opposed the war and was a vigorous part of the socialist movement.</p>

  <p>The Working Class Union had a membership estimated as high as 35,000, and may have
  had many more than the 2,000 armed men and women they are given credit for today. A
  conspiracy of silence and an effort to obliterate them from history has characterized
  events since the rebellion.</p>

  <p>The constitution of the WCU said that all members of the working class over the age
  of 18, "regardless of race, sex, color, or occupation," could join, and that "any means
  necessary" would be used to better the conditions of the working people. Their first
  demand was for the "total abolition of the crime, disease, and death-producing practice
  of rent, interest, and profit-taking as iniquities that have been and are now being
  imposed upon the working class of the world."</p>

  <p>All accounts of the rebellion come from sources hostile to a militant anti-war
  struggle and/or to socialism. A disparaging description of the people and locality can
  be found in an unpublished thesis submitted in 1932 to the Graduate Faculty of the
  University of Oklahoma by Charles D. Bush. Here is part of Bush's material:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Participants in the revolt were almost wholly native Americans. A few Negroes,
    usually coerced into joining the disaffected party, and a very small number of
    irreconcilable Snake Indians made up a minority racial group, but the vast majority
    of the people were white American citizens. Hardly a foreign name appears in the
    list. They could truthfully claim to be "one-hundred-percent Americans."
  </blockquote>

  <p>The first thing to notice about this paragraph is the racism. It is inconceivable
  that Black people would have to be coerced into a struggle for land and against a
  capitalist war, let alone a foreign war. The reference to the Snake Indians as
  "irreconcilable" does nothing to illuminate the nature of their irreconcilability. But
  it could not have been to whites in general, since this was a genuine rainbow coalition
  of poor whites, Indians, and Blacks.</p>

  <p>But let Bush continue:</p>

  <blockquote>
    A majority of these people were from the hill country of Arkansas, Tennessee, and
    other Southern states, migrating from the poorer sections of these older communities.
    These people were generally lacking in education. Actual illiteracy was common, and
    even a grade-school education was very rare. A man was locally considered
    well-educated if he was able to write a little and read the columns of the weekly
    paper.

    <p>Their schools, for the most part, were poor and attended by the children only
    during the seasons when the crops were "laid by" in July and for a brief period in
    winter. Frequently, they did not attend at all. Good schools could not be brought to
    these people because the districts were poor.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Bush then gives his views on their religion.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Shrouded in superstition, and frequently in a peculiar mysticism, their religion
    was intolerant and often wildly demonstrative. ...</p>

    <p>Economically these people were generally very poor and chronically in debt. They
    were too restless to stay long in one location and consequently they accumulated
    little property. Practically all were tenant farmers. Farm improvements, provided by
    absentee owners, were of the very poorest kind. Untutored even in agriculture, they
    generally depended on one crop -- cotton -- and measured their prosperity or poverty
    by the price of cotton and the prevalence of the boll weevil.</p>

    <p>In many respects these men were little more than serfs or peons, slaves to a "cash
    crop" demanded by their landlords. Yet they did but little to help themselves. When
    they did have money, they spent it freely and often foolishly. The practice of saving
    was generally neglected, and they lived from crop to crop, year to year, vaguely
    dissatisfied, always dreaming of a new country somewhere. ...</p>

    <p>Many turned to Socialism as a sort of gospel of despair.</p>

    <p>The finer tenets of Socialism were undoubtedly but faintly understood by these
    people, but it offered a hope that neither of the major parties promised, and a
    recognition that had long been denied them except during the hot days of the summer
    primaries. Socialism gained rapidly in strength. It not only became a real third
    party but it also had its third of the total area vote and its share of county
    officers, at the time the world was plunged into the Great War.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Probably the fullest account of the rebellion is contained in the book, <em>If You
  Don't Weaken,</em> <a href="#fn6">[6]</a> <a name="ret6" id="ret6"></a> the
  autobiography of Oscar Ameringer. Ameringer had direct contact with some members of the
  Green Corn Rebellion. He was also a socialist of sorts, who says he was in the camp of
  the "Yellows" as against the "Reds" or left wing.</p>

  <p>His account begins with a characterization of the event as the "worst" thing that
  had happened during his absence from Oklahoma. He explains that the rebellion got its
  name from the green corn, or roasting ears, which constituted the principal diet of the
  rebels. (Other versions, however, say it came from the annual green corn dance of the
  Shawnee Indians.)</p>

  <p>Ameringer's account is most tendentious where he <em>ex post facto</em> relates how
  he warned the rebels about what would befall the splendid Socialist organization if the
  Working Class Union decided to take up arms in the anti-war struggle.</p>

  <blockquote>
    My own connection was that of an adviser whose advice was not followed. I had heard
    rumors of an intended putsch, but knew nothing about it until I was invited to attend
    a meeting of a small group of extreme leftwingers. In this connection I should add
    that farmers are naturally given to direct action, or self-help. This trait is
    primarily due to their isolation and the strong individualism arising from that fact.
    To these extreme leftists, the policy and tactics of the Socialists, as expressed in
    education, organization, and political action, were too slow. They were the true
    Reds; we of the center and right wing were "compromisers," "opportunists," and
    "yellows."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Evidently Ameringer had been sent by the right wing of the party to frighten the
  organizers of the rebellion into giving up their plans. The leader, Tad Cumbie, must
  have refused to meet with him, knowing what he was up to, but out of courtesy he sent a
  few people just to listen. The right wing of the Socialist Party was notoriously
  hostile to such a multi-national, working class coalition.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In order to secure speedy action they had organized the Working Class Union and
    the Jones Family. Both of these were secret societies, as contrasted to the open and
    aboveboard organization of the Socialists. ... The real leaders of the two
    organizations were not present at that meeting for the simple reason that they knew
    well enough that we "yellows" had done everything in our power to destroy their
    influence among our people. After the customary preliminaries, we got down to
    business. They had, I was told, sent for me to give me a chance to change from yellow
    to red.</p>

    <p>"And what, precisely, have you boys in mind in relation to my changing color?"</p>

    <p>"We are going to stop this damned war the gang out East has foisted on us."</p>

    <p>"But how?"</p>

    <p>"On a given signal we'll slam the bankers, county officials, and newspaper owners
    in jail."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In relating his own version of what was said, Ameringer tells how he continued to
  question them on how they would keep the insurrection secret. Finally he advises them
  to "scatter right now," and adds, for the "benefit" of any spies who may be
  present:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"The only thing any one of us can do is to work for a speedy peace through all the
    legal and constitutional means still open to us. This is what I am going to do. This
    is what I advise all of you and your followers to do. . . ."</p>

    <p>When the Green Corn Rebellion had fizzled out, as we "yellows" predicted, a
    veritable white terror swept Oklahoma, and of course, we were on the receiving end.
    ...</p>

    <p>Though not a single official of the Party was connected with the Green Corn
    Rebellion, thousands of our members were arrested. Jails were so overcrowded that
    four hundred prisoners were shipped to the state penitentiary for safekeeping.
    Thousands sought safety in the Winding Stairs Mountains, in adjoining Colorado,
    Texas, and Arkansas.</p>

    <p>Of the Green Corn rebels convicted, some thirty-odd went to Leavenworth, the
    federal prison, from which the last of them were released after Kate Richards O'Hare
    had marched their wives and children to Washington, where they picketed the White
    House. ...</p>

    <p>Shortly after the trial of the Green Corn rebels an emergency convention of the
    mortally wounded Party was held in Oklahoma City. It was at that convention that
    Patrick S. Nagle, one of the leading attorneys of the rebels, sponsored and succeeded
    in passing a resolution disbanding the Socialist Party of Oklahoma.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Ameringer blames the Oklahoma rebels for the destruction of the Socialist Party,
  whose leaders were soon thereafter put on trial in Chicago on charges of conspiracy to
  obstruct the war. But in reality the SP dissolved its Oklahoma organization in a panic
  and a cowardly surrender to the war hysteria. The leaders of the SP on trial in Chicago
  had not been indicted for the Green Corn Rebellion.</p>

  <p>To dissolve a party branch usually required ratification by referendum. But this was
  not done, even though the Oklahoma organization was one of the strongest locals of the
  SP.</p>

  <p>Ameringer gives only a sketchy description of the rebellion itself. Not too much
  more of substance is provided in this account by Garin Burbank, author of <em>When
  Farmers Voted Red:</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When the Socialist party resolved that its members should refuse to serve the
    "militarists" and die "fighting the enemies of Humanity" in their own country, some
    of the tenants took the advice literally. When distant Europe's troubles were
    officially declared to be America's own and when federal and state authorities
    prepared to enforce the 1917 Conscription Act in Oklahoma, country people rebelled.
    On August 3, 1917 an ill-organized band of country rebels met a well-armed posse
    along the banks of the South Canadian River between Seminole, Pontotoc, and Hughes
    counties. The country rebels did not know that their plans had been largely betrayed
    by an informer in their own ranks. Catching sight of the advancing townsmen, the
    country people fired a few desultory shots and fled in disorder. This was the
    pathetic end of their overt resistance to the incursions of outside political
    authority.<a href="#fn7">[7]</a> <a name="ret7" id="ret7"></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A paragraph in Howard Zinn's, <em>A People's History of the United States</em>
  includes this information on the rebellion: "At a mass meeting of the [Working Class]
  Union, plans were made to destroy a railroad bridge and cut telegraph wires in order to
  block military enlistments. A march on Washington was planned for draft objectors
  throughout the country." <a href="#fn8">[8]</a> <a name="ret8" id="ret8"></a></p>

  <p>A more detailed account of the Green Corn Rebellion is found in <em>Grass-Roots
  Socialism</em> by James R. Green. Here is what he has to say:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Although two of its leaders, "Rube" Munson and Homer Spence, had already been
    indicted for obstructing the draft, the Working Class Union continued to organize in
    eastern Oklahoma and by midsummer it had recruited a membership estimated at between
    eighteen thousand and thirty-five thousand. On August 22, the Seminole County sheriff
    and some deputies set out from Wewoka to investigate mysterious radical activities in
    a district with WCU loyalties. The lawmen were ambushed and driven away by five black
    men who belonged to the secret order. That night, just a day after the body of
    Oklahoma-born Wobbly, Frank Little, was found hanging from a trestle outside of
    Butte, Montana, the WCU called a secret meeting on a sandbar in the Canadian River
    and decided to take action. Munson and Spence, who were free on bail, had been
    agitating in and around Seminole County for several days, urging resisters to arm
    themselves and to prepare for a fight. Sentiment against the war and the draft had
    been rising since the spring. As pressure for conscription increased, the isolated
    tenants of the old Indian Nations grew more determined to resist the patriotic
    demands of President Wilson and his agents in the country seats. They were not going
    to let the "Big Slick" in Washington send them off to die in France.</p>

    <p>On the morning of August 3, resisters from the WCU and the Jones Family gathered
    on a bluff near the farm of "old man" Spears who had raised the "red flag of
    rebellion" above his barn a few days before. During the night raiding parties went
    out to cut telegraph and telephone wires and to bum railroad bridges in the area.
    They also blew up some oil pipelines leading out of the Healdton fields. On the
    previous day WCU agitators had been blamed for a spontaneous "political" strike at a
    large coal mine in Wilberton, where the Socialist party had one of its largest
    locals. The new secretary of District 21, a Democrat who had replaced Fred Holt,
    failed to persuade the militant miners to return to work. He suspended the charter of
    this UMW local which he said was under the influence of the IWW. Agents of resistance
    also moved into the poor cotton country south of the Canadian River, where they
    encouraged armed action against the draft. Incendiary posters like the following were
    found along the country roads in Marshall and Bryan counties: "Now is the time to
    rebel against this war with Germany boys. Get together boys and don't go. Rich mans
    war. Poor mans fight. If you don't go J.P. Morgan Co. is lost. Speculation is the
    only cause of war. Rebel now."</p>

    <p>The main body of militants on Spears' Bluff gathered more supporters from the
    surrounding tenant country, including a group of black WCU sharecroppers and several
    Indians led by John Harjo, one of the many relatives of the Creek renegade, Crazy
    Snake, who had led the last armed rebellion against white rule in the Indian Nations
    eight years before. A WCU organizer, W.L. Benefield, led the largest contingent, a
    group of about fifty well-armed tenants from the Lone Dove community near Saskawa.
    "Captain" Bill wearing a sabre and a dashing red sash, took overall command of the
    resistance army at Spears' Bluff.</p>

    <p>Along with other revolutionaries, he railed against the "Big Slick" and the
    tyranny of conscription. "Rube" Munson told the men that other uprisings were
    occurring throughout the West. A large army of Wobblies would march on Washington to
    overthrow the government and put an end to the war and the draft. The Working Class
    Union should start its own march to the nation's capital, and link up with thousands
    of farmers and workers throughout the land who would also be up in arms. The Oklahoma
    rebels would be the vanguard of an army marching across the South to the sea, living
    on beef and ripe corn as it traveled. And so, this uprising came to be called the
    Green Corn Rebellion.</p>

    <p>The insurgent farmers who gathered along the banks of the Canadian River on August
    3 never started marching. A posse of seventy mobilized immediately after hearing
    about the resisters' violent activities and quickly advanced on the rebel stronghold.
    The undisciplined tenants disobeyed "Captain" Benefield's orders and fled when they
    saw the armed townsmen moving against them; the bloodless battle of Spears Bluff was
    a rout. The papers said we were cowards," a Green Corn rebel recalled, "but we
    weren't." Walter Strong explained, "Some of the men in the posse were neighbors of
    ours and we couldn't shoot 'em down in cold blood. That's the way we felt 'bout the
    Germans too. ... We didn't have no quarrel with them at all."</p>

    <p>For the next week posses rounded up radicals, resisters, suspected rebels. They
    fought several bloody skirmishes with backwoods renegades, but within a week the law
    enforcers had crushed the organized militant antiwar movement in Oklahoma. Of the 450
    men arrested for allegedly participating in the rebellion, 184 were indicted, 150
    convicted, and in the fall about half that number sentenced to prison terms. After
    the fear of lynch mobs receded, most of the men arrested in the roundup, including
    many Socialists who had had no part in the rebellion, were released from the state
    penitentiary at McAlester. The rebel leaders, including Tad Cumbie, Socialist party
    gubernatorial candidate in 1910, and the WCU captains, were given stiff sentences at
    Leavenworth, because they were responsible for "misleading" the ignorant
    farmers.<a href="#fn9">[9]</a> <a name="ret9" id="ret9"></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The published sources we have mentioned claim that the rebellion was quelled and its
  leaders arrested before their plans could be carried out. But Oklahoma progressives
  alive today who remember those times say that a march of thousands did converge on
  Oklahoma City. While the leaders were arrested, the courthouse was besieged by so many
  hundreds of their supporters that many were let go with only one-dollar fines.</p>

  <p>Weinstein's book on the Socialist movement, <em>The Decline of Socialism in America,
  1912-1925,</em> contains a brief account of the rebellion which does not even mention
  that it included Black as well as Native people, indicating solidarity between the
  working class and oppressed peoples. At that period in history this was a rarity and
  had immense significance in light of the chauvinism and racism of the right wing in the
  Socialist Party.</p>

  <p>Berger and his group, unlike Debs and Haywood, looked down on the poorer workers and
  tenant farmers. Like the social democrats in Germany, they were oriented more toward
  the skilled workers and the intelligentsia. The racism of Berger and the right wing of
  the party was shamefully apparent. Indeed, one of the basic reasons for the eventual
  disintegration of the SP was its refusal to link up with the struggle of the Black
  masses.</p>

  <p>Most of the authors who deal with the Green Corn Rebellion either do not know what
  to make of it, treat it as something way out of this world involving only a so-called
  lunatic fringe element, or, like Weinstein, regard it as a sad but dramatic event in
  the struggle against the war.</p>

  <p>Weinstein lumps together this revolutionary development with ill-conceived
  individual acts of sabotage directed against soldiers. This obscures the revolutionary
  significance of the Green Corn Rebellion. It was a mass struggle which should not be
  confused with isolated individual acts. In many ways, it was an early harbinger of the
  future, a promise of how the working class, including Black, Latin, Asian, and Native
  people, can fight together as one in the struggle against capitalism.</p>

  <p>This popular insurrection did not conform to the preconceptions of many socialists
  of the time or of later historians. They expected a mass antiwar movement if it
  unfolded to develop new creative forms within the electoral and trade union arenas.
  They were removed from the lives of the tenant farmers, Black and Native people, and
  unemployed workers in areas like Oklahoma.</p>

  <p>As Marx pointed out in his study of the Paris Commune, new forms of development are
  often mistaken for older social transformations; the Commune of Paris in 1871 was
  likened to that of 1791. The Green Corn Rebellion was not just a repeat of earlier
  uprisings, as Ameringer suggests, but a very early form of a new alignment of forces
  that becomes more relevant as the struggle in the U.S. unfolds today.</p>

  <p>None of the accounts mentioned here takes into consideration the relationship
  between the progressive anti-capitalist and antiwar propaganda of the socialist
  movement and the insurrection. The insurrection, as these historians see it, was
  something that arose out of the blue and carried to the very extreme in a distorted way
  the socialist program for working class emancipation from imperialist war. That,
  however, is not so.</p>

  <p>The Working Class Union was not isolated from the rest of the socialist movement in
  the country. It certainly was not isolated from the Socialist Party of Oklahoma, which
  Weinstein tells us had at the time as many as 1,500 locals in the state. Ameringer
  himself says there were 57,000 members of the Socialist Party in Oklahoma alone. Daniel
  Bell writes in <em>Marxian Socialism in the U.S.</em> <a href="#fn10">[10]</a> <a name=
  "ret10" id="ret10"></a> that per capita it was the largest local in the country. Tad
  Cumbie, leader of the Working Class Union, was well known and had politically drawn
  swords with Victor Berger from Milwaukee, leader of the right wing of the Socialist
  Party, over questions of tactics and strategy.</p>

  <p>As Ameringer himself relates, "At the convention of 1912 in Indianapolis a rather
  bitter controversy had broken out among the simon-pure Marxists and the revisionists,
  to which latter group both Victor (Berger) and I were adherents. In one of his usual
  brief remarks he had pointed out the folly of separating ourselves from the body of the
  nation. 'Don't,' he warned, 'be like the ancient Hebrews who, when going on a journey,
  carried a bundle of hay to sleep on so as not to come in contact with a place on which
  a Gentile had previously slept.'</p>

  <p>"That afternoon," he says, "Tad Cumbie, 'the Gray Horse of the Prairie,' and one of
  our irreconcilables, who was to become commander in chief of the Green Corn Rebellion,
  appeared with a tiny bundle of hay pinned to his flaming red shirt.</p>

  <p>" 'Well, Victor,' said Tad, 'here is my bundle of hay.'</p>

  <p>" 'Well, well,' replied Victor, 'I see you brought your lunch with you.' " a href="#fn11">[11]</a> <a name=
  "ret11" id="ret11"></a></p>

  <p>The idea that the rebellion was an isolated event, that the mass of the participants
  in the Green Corn Rebellion had no idea what they were for or what the struggle between
  the left and the right was all about, is a complete distortion.</p>

  <p>It is equally false to portray the rebellious workers and farmers -- Black, Native,
  and white -- as ignorant, lacking in common sense, and being taken in by a momentary
  impulse.</p>

  <p>The Working Class Union leadership was intent on taking to heart what the program of
  the Socialist Party called for in the eventuality of an imperialist war. Even more to
  the point, they tried to carry out the historic resolution of the St. Louis convention
  of the Socialist Party which had taken place immediately after the U.S. entered the
  war.</p>

  <p>That resolution not only condemned the war, but as we have shown above, reaffirmed
  the principle of working class internationalism. "The only struggle," said the
  resolution, "which would justify the workers in taking up arms is the great struggle of
  the working class of the world to free itself from economic exploitation and political
  oppression."</p>

  <p>The slogan of "War against war!" had originated among the European socialists before
  their leadership turned renegade. To serious revolutionary socialists, whose sons were
  about to shed their blood, as they put it, "for Morgan and the bankers," the
  alternative was to take up arms. There were several such mutinies in Western Europe
  toward the close of the world imperialist slaughter.</p>

  <p>This was also precisely the strategic outlook fought for by Lenin which enabled the
  Bolsheviks to turn the imperialist war into civil war, overturn the czarist autocracy
  and establish the first successful workers' state in history.</p>

  <p>The Green Corn Rebellion should not be confused with isolated, anarchistic acts by a
  small group of petty bourgeois leaders divorced from the masses, who seek to substitute
  their own adventurism for the mass activity of the working class. It is altogether
  unlikely that Tad Cumbie and his comrades were unacquainted with the stirring
  developments at the St. Louis convention or that he himself was not a participant in
  it. He was on speaking terms with the Socialist leaders, as Ameringer himself relates.
  The conclusions he drew were diametrically opposite to the ones drawn by those who
  wanted to confine the struggle to mere electoral bouts and protests or who were for
  throwing in the towel altogether and joining the chauvinists.</p>

  <p>The St. Louis resolution did not specifically forbid armed struggle to defeat the
  imperialist war. It in fact could be interpreted as a call to arms, certainly under
  circumstances which favored such a struggle.</p>

  <p>The St. Louis resolution was virtually a reaffirmation of the famous resolution
  passed at the International Socialist Congress of 1907 at Stuttgart and reaffirmed in
  1912 at Basel. These resolutions, as we have already said, had been widely disseminated
  and discussed for years. A variety of divergent tactics were discussed at these
  congresses. Once the war broke out, however, a capitulationist position was taken by
  most of the European parties, led by the most famous of the German Social Democrats,
  Karl Kautsky. In the U.S., Berger was a representative of this same trend.</p>

  <p>Even such measures as the calling of a general strike to stop the war had been
  proposed at these early conferences. This, however, was generally opposed so as to
  leave the propriety of such a decision up to the discretion of each section of the
  International and not pin all hopes on just one tactic. In some countries a general
  strike was not feasible in light of the weakness of the socialists in the trade union
  movement. In other places revolutionary mass actions were more suitable.</p>

  <p>Big Bill Haywood, a leader of the IWW and the representative of the U.S. at the 1912
  International Congress, had urged a general strike. The issue here is not whether he
  was correct in proposing it as a practical measure, but rather how it demonstrates that
  the movement in the U.S. was oriented toward stopping an imperialist war by mass
  intervention and not confining the movement to mere protests or electoral
  procedures.</p>

  <p>The direct action supporters, while militant and revolutionary, did not possess the
  necessary Marxist approach which Lenin elaborated at the very beginning of the war and
  relentlessly and successfully pursued to the very end. Lenin reshaped and refined the
  rather generalized 1907 and 1912 resolutions of the Socialist International on war.
  They had called for the abolition of the capitalist system and the end of exploitation,
  for "War upon war." He made it more concrete. Lenin's program embodied the idea of
  revolutionary defeatism: that the defeat of one's own capitalist government was the
  lesser evil in the struggle against imperialist war. He called for converting the
  imperialist war into civil war.</p>

  <p>The Green Corn Rebellion leaders were on the right track!</p>

  <p>The right-wing Socialists were on another track. They ultimately succumbed to the
  war hysteria, the intimidation and repression. None of the accounts of the rebellion
  show the slightest interest in assessing what tactics should have been employed to
  actually stop the war.</p>

  <p>The Leninist approach was to carry out both legal and illegal work in the struggle
  against the war; to utilize legal parliamentary struggles and combine them with
  extra-parlamentary, or illegal, work. The Bolsheviks combined all forms of tactics
  which could stop the war and conceivably transform it into a war of liberation of the
  working class against the capitalist class.</p>

  <p>That is what those who were fighting and dying on the war front really wanted.
  Everyone in the U.S. movement was in favor of legal activity where it was available,
  but the government under the Wilson administration was bent on curtailing and
  destroying it as it suppressed the socialist press and carried out an early version of
  the McCarthy witch-hunt.</p>

  <p>Ameringer poses himself as an adviser to the revolutionary leaders of the Green Corn
  Rebellion. But he must have appeared to them as a city slicker, a bourgeois socialist
  bent on confining the movement to paltry reforms. He paints them as either stupid or
  naive. But these men and women from Oklahoma who lived near to the earth and the forms
  of exploitation existing in that era, who knew what it was like to risk life and limb,
  were hardly taken to flights of fancy.</p>

  <p>The peasant stock everywhere and working class people in general may not attain the
  level of academic education of middle class socialists, who in that period had surged
  to the top and won many elected offices in the party and in local elections. But they
  were not bereft of common sense and the shrewdness that comes with the difficult
  struggle for existence. They were idealistic and believed in the justness of their
  cause, and the propriety of taking up arms. They also probably had good reason to think
  that, with more than just an abstract affinity to the great centers where the IWW was
  strong, it conceivably would link up with them once the initiative was taken to do
  so.</p>

  <p>That they faltered as the result of an uneven struggle and the collapse of the
  socialist movement is because they were hit by a double-barreled load that came both
  from the government and from the surrender of the Socialist Party leadership of
  Oklahoma.</p>

  <p>The planning of the insurrection could not have been a secret in Oklahoma. It could
  not have been a secret to the Socialist Party leadership there, with which the Working
  Class Union was in contact, and all of whom were considered to be in one camp. Had the
  official Socialist Party leadership been bent on opposition to the war rather than
  dissolving the party and running away from the struggle, who knows what may have
  developed as a result of the revolutionary initiative. It is easy to condemn, scorn,
  and deride it in hindsight. What was necessary and indispensable was a coordination of
  the socialist electoral struggle with an extra-legal, revolutionary struggle against
  the war.</p>

  <p>The Green Corn Rebellion was an echo of the revolutionary defeatism practiced in
  Russia by the Bolsheviks and in Germany by the left-wing socialists headed by Karl
  Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg.</p>

  <p>In France, too, a rebellion broke out in the armed forces led by Andre Marti, who
  was then a heroic revolutionary figure. Had the Russian Revolution not been victorious,
  wouldn't Marti have been regarded with scorn, if not amusement, the way Tad Cumbie is
  treated in these accounts? But Marti was lifted to revolutionary fame at a later date
  when the left wing of the Socialist Party of France reconstituted itself as the
  Communist Party.</p>

  <p>Had Marx not analyzed the Paris Commune as an early model of working class
  revolution and the seizure of state power, had Lenin not drawn on those lessons from
  Marx, had the Bolshevik Revolution not triumphed, the Paris Commune would have gone
  down only as a futile uprising which cost a great many lives.</p>

  <p>Marx did not urge the Parisian workers to rise up during the Franco-Prussian War. On
  the contrary, he warned against it and said it would be folly to undertake such a
  course. But once the insurrection was on, Marx immediately declared his solidarity with
  the workers of Paris and proceeded to draw revolutionary lessons from the Commune which
  the international working class is still learning.</p>

  <p>The revolutionary socialist and class-conscious leadership which sees that a
  premature uprising is in the making by an authentic detachment of the working class and
  oppressed people has a duty to act in solidarity with the objective of the general
  uprising. It also must concentrate on finding ways and means to cut the losses and
  guide the struggle through a difficult period so as to preserve this splendid
  detachment of the working class, learn from what errors there were in calculation,
  strengthen the bonds of solidarity with them in the face of persecution, and move on to
  higher ground to prepare for the next offensive, even if that involves a tactical
  retreat on the part of both elements of the movement.</p>

  <p>To have dissolved the Socialist Party in Oklahoma, this "splendid" organization as
  Ameringer puts it, was a cowardly act in the face of fire from the enemy. It abandoned
  a singularly significant detachment of the army of the working class during the
  socialist struggle against imperialist war.</p>

  <p>The indictments of the national executive committee of the Socialist Party
  constituted one front of the overall struggle of the imperialist government against the
  working class in general and the socialist movement in particular. It didn't help these
  defendants one iota that their organization dissolved the Oklahoma party and denounced
  the Green Corn Rebellion.</p>

  <p>It's all well and good to abide by bourgeois legality if the capitalist government
  itself sticks to its norms of bourgeois legality. But by suppressing the socialist and
  working class press, by promoting, instigating, and organizing vigilante mobs not only
  to harass and disrupt socialist organizations but to attempt to destroy them, the
  capitalist government violated its own legal norms. The war which had been perpetrated
  was itself illegal because it was based on fraud and deceit. Wilson had promised again
  and again to stay out of the war, but in reality had planned from the beginning to get
  the U.S. headlong into it. As the socialists said, this was done for the good of the
  bankers and industrialists and against the interests of the working class.</p>

  <p>By suppressing socialist agitation, by having enacted an unconstitutional espionage
  law, by virtually abrogating the First Amendment, the capitalist government broke its
  own legal norms. The working class and oppressed people have a right to strike back in
  kind, especially when legal avenues have become narrow to nonexistent and the world is
  in the midst of a bloody slaughter.</p>

  <p>We should not be the first to fire the shots, Engels admonished the Socialist Party
  toward the close of his life. But, he added, some of the early theoreticians like
  Montesquieu who wrote about the forms of bourgeois government taught that the relation
  between the people and the government is the result of a contract. Now, if that be true
  and the government violates its contract, then of course the working class should be
  free to do whatever it deems necessary to promote its own ends -- emancipation from
  capitalist slavery and imperialist war.</p>

  <p>The lessons of the Green Corn Rebellion should be studied and researched again and
  again in relationship to the contemporary wars of U.S. imperialism.</p>

  <p>Liberal imperialist politicians do not at all mind mere protests against imperialist
  wars, wars they themselves not only permit but are downright central figures in. People
  like Robert McNamara, McGeorge Bundy, George Kennan of cold war fame, and George Ball,
  who come across now as liberals but were architects of the wars in Viet Nam, the
  Dominican Republic, and the Middle East, do not at all mind dissent and protests
  against imperialist wars if they are orderly, reasonable, and show the proper decorum
  toward the military-industrial complex and the constituted authorities in general.</p>

  <p>As long as the war machine is permitted to function smoothly, a little dissent and
  mass protest kept within bounds may even make the capitalist government operate more
  effectively and smooth the machinery of war.</p>

  <p>It is all part of the "democratic way," the way of imperialist profits and the
  expansion of capitalist markets in the search for new sources of raw materials and
  cheap labor. The result of this process eventually is unemployment, increasing poverty,
  a declining living standard for the masses and the growth of super-profits as a result
  of extortionate loans on a world scale.</p>

  <p>What were the "differences" between the liberal capitalist politicians and the
  Reaganites over the Grenada invasion? They came down not to a struggle over principle
  but to a quibble over whether the U.S. should have better methods. Should it have first
  invoked the War Powers Act and gotten Congressional approval; could the same results
  have been accomplished by methods of diversion; should the invasion have taken place
  with the collusion of the press and media instead of without it.</p>

  <p>But in no case were any of them for the right of the Grenadan people to determine
  their own destiny, that is, a socialist destiny in alliance with other socialist
  countries. That, of course, was subversive of the interests of predatory
  imperialism.</p>

  <p>The mass movement that attempted the Green Corn Rebellion, unlike Lenin's thoroughly
  Marxist working class organization, did not use a variety of forms of struggle in its
  effort to stop the imperialist war. It was derided and minimized by the right wing of
  the socialist movement for its failure.</p>

  <p>But the capitulation of the socialist leaders to the war was a much greater failure.
  The First World War cost 20 million lives and many more casualties. It laid the basis
  for yet another holocaust just two decades later when imperialism unleashed a second
  world war in its insatiable drive for profits. The cost escalated to another 50 million
  dead. Since then the bloodshed has continued with hundreds of interventions and dozens
  of "local" wars instigated by U.S. imperialism. And each day the specter of nuclear war
  becomes more threatening.</p>

  <p>The only response commensurate to this grave situation is the kind of all-round,
  revolutionary working class struggle against war and the capitalist system itself that
  Lenin's party carried out so successfully. The Green Corn Rebellion, a genuine
  revolutionary coalition of the most downtrodden workers and oppressed, showed in an
  early and premature form that the forces for such a struggle are being generated here
  on the soil of the world's greatest imperialist power.</p>
