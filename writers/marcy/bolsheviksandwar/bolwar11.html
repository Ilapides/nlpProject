  <h1><small>Appendix V</small><br />
  Zimmerwald Declaration of sympathy</h1>

  <h3>Declaration of sympathy for the war victims and the persecuted, adopted by the
  International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald</h3>

  <p>The International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald sends its expression of
  profoundest sympathy to the countless victims of the war, to the Polish and Belgian
  people, to the persecuted Jewish and Armenian peoples, to the millions of human beings
  who are tormented by boundless sufferings and who have had to bear untold horrors.</p>

  <p>The Conference honors the memory of the great Socialist Jean Jaures, the first
  victim of the war who fell as a martyr and fighter in the struggle against chauvinism
  and for peace. It honors the memory of the Socialist fighters Tutzowicz and Catanesi,
  who lost their young lives on the battlefield.</p>

  <p>The Conference sends the expression of its profound and fraternal sympathy to the
  <strong>Duma Deputies exiled to Siberia</strong> who are continuing the glorious
  revolutionary tradition of Russia, to <strong>Liebknecht</strong> and
  <strong>Monatte,</strong> fettered by capitalism, both of whom have taken up the
  struggle against the civil peace policy of the workers in their respective countries,
  to Comrades <strong>Luxemburg</strong> and <strong>Clara Zetkin</strong> who have been
  imprisoned for their Socialist convictions, and to all comrades, men and women, who
  have been persecuted or arrested because they have waged a struggle against war.</p>

  <p>The Conference solemnly vows to honor the living and dead by following the example
  of these brave fighters and by indefatigably carrying out the task of awakening the
  revolutionary spirit in the masses of the international proletariat, and uniting them
  in the struggle against the fratricidal war and against capitalist society.</p>
