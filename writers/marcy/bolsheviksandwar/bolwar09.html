  <h5>Bolsheviks and War [Sam Marcy]</h5>

  <h1><small>Appendix III</small><br />
  International Socialist Women's Conference (Berne)</h1>

  <h3>Resolution introduced by the delegation of the Central Committee of the Bolsheviks
  to the International Socialist Women's Conference at Berne</h3>

  <p>The present world war, which has caused so many calamities wherever it has been
  waged, has devastated and ruined Belgium and Galicia, and has destroyed thousands upon
  thousands of workers' lives, is an imperialist war caused by the rivalry between the
  ruling classes of the several countries for the division of colonies and for
  predominance on the world markets, as well as by dynastic interests. It is the natural
  continuation of the policies of the capitalist class and of the governments of all
  countries, and, therefore, the question as to who was the first to strike the blow is
  of no interest whatsoever from the Socialist standpoint.</p>

  <p>Not only does this war not to any extent serve the interests of the workers, but it
  serves as a weapon in the hands of the ruling classes for the destruction of the
  international solidarity of the workers, and for the weakening of their movement and
  the class struggle within each country. In the same manner, the slogan "defense of the
  fatherland," which has been proclaimed by the bourgeoisie and endorsed by the
  opportunists, is nothing but a lure used by the bourgeoisie to persuade the proletariat
  to sacrifice their lives and blood for the interests of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Taking all this into consideration the extraordinary International Socialist Women's
  Conference, referring to the Stuttgart resolution, which recommends that the economic
  and political crisis caused by war be taken advantage of to arouse the people so as to
  hasten the downfall of the capitalist order, to the Copenhagen resolution which
  declares that it is the duty of Socialist Deputies to vote against war appropriations,
  and to the Basel resolution, which proclaims that the workers regard it as a crime to
  fire at each other, hereby declares that the representatives of the majority of the
  Socialist parties in the belligerent countries have been acting in utter disregard of
  those resolutions and have committed, yielding to the pressure of circumstances, a
  veritable betrayal of Socialism for which they have substituted nationalism. The
  Conference proclaims that the proletarians of all countries have no other enemy but
  their class enemy which is the capitalist class.</p>

  <p>The terrific sufferings which this war has caused have been arousing in all women,
  and especially in proletarian women, an ever-growing desire for peace. The conference
  declares <strong>war upon every imperialist war,</strong> and at the same time states
  its belief that in order that this desire for peace may be transformed into a
  <strong>conscious political force, it is essential that the women workers should
  clearly realize that the propertied classes strive for nothing else</strong> than
  annexations, conquest, and domination, that in the epoch of imperialism wars are
  inevitable, and that imperialism threatens the whole world with an entire series of
  wars, unless <strong>the proletariat finds sufficient strength in itself to put an end
  to the capitalist order, by a complete overthrow of capitalism.</strong> If a
  workingwoman is anxious to shorten the period of sufferings which is connected with the
  epoch of imperialist wars, it is indispensable that her desire for peace turn
  <strong>into revolt and into struggle for Socialism. It is only through the
  revolutionary movement of the masses through the strengthening and intensifying of the
  Socialist struggle, that the workingwoman will attain her end in this
  struggle.</strong> Her first duty is thus that of supporting the labor unions and
  Socialist organizations and of breaking the civil peace by fighting against war
  appropriations, against the participation in bourgeois cabinets, by supporting and
  encouraging the fraternizing among soldiers in the trenches and on the battlefield, by
  setting up illegal organizations wherever the government has repealed the
  constitutional liberties, and, finally, by drawing the masses into participation in
  demonstrations and revolutionary movements.</p>

  <p>The International Socialist Women's Conference appeals to the workingwomen of all
  countries to start this struggle forthwith, to organize it on an international scale,
  and to combine their action closely with that of those Socialists who, like Liebknecht,
  fight in all countries against nationalism and carry on a revolutionary Socialist
  struggle.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Conference reminds the workingwomen that in the most advanced
  countries of Europe the objective conditions for Socialist production are already ripe,
  that the entire movement is entering a new phase, that the present world war imposes
  upon them new and serious duties, that their movement may be the forerunner of a
  general action of the masses, which will give a new impulse to the entire Socialist
  movement and will bring nearer the hour of complete liberation. By assuming the
  initiative in the matter of organizing demonstrations and revolutionary protests, the
  workingwomen, marching abreast with the proletariat as a whole, will be in a position
  to usher in the new era of proletarian struggle, during which the proletariat will
  attain Socialism in the more advanced countries, and a democratic republic in the more
  backward ones.</p>
