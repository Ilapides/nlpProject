  <h1><small>Appendix VIII</small><br />
  Two Declarations made at Zimmerwald</h1>

  <h3>Two declarations made at the International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald</h3>

  <p class="c1"><strong>1</strong></p>

  <p>The undersigned declare as follows:</p>

  <p>The manifesto adopted by the Conference does not give us complete satisfaction. It
  contains no pronouncement on either open opportunism or opportunism that is hiding
  under radical phraseology -- the opportunism which is not only the chief cause of the
  collapse of the International, but which strives to perpetuate that collapse. The
  manifesto contains no clear pronouncement as to the methods of fighting against the
  war.</p>

  <p>We shall continue, as we have done heretofore, to advocate in the Socialist press
  and at the meetings of the International, a clear-cut Marxist position in regard to the
  tasks with which the epoch of imperialism has confronted the proletariat.</p>

  <p>We vote for the manifesto because we regard it as a call to struggle and in this
  struggle we are anxious to march side by side with the other sections of the
  International.</p>

  <p>We request that our present declaration be included in the official proceedings.</p>

  <p>(Signed): N. Lenin, G. Zinoviev, Radek, Nerman, Hoglund, Winter.</p>

  <p class="c1"><strong>2</strong></p>

  <p>The other declaration, which was signed, in addition to the group that had
  introduced the resolution of the Left by Roland-Holst and Trotsky, read as follows:</p>

  <p>"Inasmuch as the adoption of our amendment (to the manifesto) demanding the vote
  against war appropriations might in a way endanger the success of the Conference, we
  do, under protest, withdraw our amendment and accept Ledebour's statement in the
  commission to the effect that the manifesto contains all that is implied in our
  proposition."</p>

  <p>It may be added that Ledebour, as an ultimatum, demanded the rejection of the
  amendment, refusing to sign the manifesto otherwise.</p>
