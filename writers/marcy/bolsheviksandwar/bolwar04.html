  Class struggle in the nuclear age</h1>

  <p>The threat of nuclear war has hung over humanity for almost four decades. It is
  commonly regarded as an outgrowth of the development of science and technology. Many
  scientists and progressive scholars and economists attribute it to the fact that
  humanity has lost control over its own productive forces. But this is an altogether too
  narrow and in any case one-sided view of the situation.</p>

  <p>Nuclear energy could have been developed and tried experimentally for civilian
  purposes. The threat of nuclear war would never have arisen had the productive forces
  of society become the common property of humanity, as the earth and its natural
  resources once were before the dawn of class society.</p>

  <p>The nuclear threat continues to grow and become more menacing every day not because
  these products of human technology are uncontrollable but because they are the
  outgrowth of a science and technology completely tied to the development of capitalist
  imperialism. Science and technology have not only become subservient to big capital,
  they have become integrated with the capitalist state.</p>

  <p>Before the arms race in nuclear weapons began, there were arms races in biological,
  chemical, air, and naval weaponry. Prior to World War I, technology and science were
  being feverishly developed in what was called "the race between the dreadnoughts."
  These were huge battleships which were able to deal the most dreadful destruction on
  sea and on land. One of the principal proponents of stimulating ever-speedier and more
  effective weapons of war, such as the dreadnought, was imperialist Britain. It was
  intent on preserving and expanding its vast, far-flung empire of colonies all around
  the globe from which it extracted imperialist booty. Because it spanned the globe, it
  could truly be said, "The sun never sets on the British Empire."</p>

  <p>But coming up fast was imperialist Germany, a newer, more efficient, and more
  developed industrial colossus which felt constricted and constrained by the military,
  and above all naval power of Britain. The race between Germany and Britain for speedier
  dreadnoughts took on more and more momentum, particularly as Germany began to develop a
  huge and effective submarine fleet.</p>

  <p>During this period French imperialism was by no means idle. Nor was Japan. And the
  czarist empire, weak and tottering under the blows of a revolutionary proletariat and
  peasantry, had still by no means surrendered its role as the gendarme over at least a
  part of Europe.</p>

  <p>The U.S. was not the neutral power which Wilson had so vehemently and dramatically
  proclaimed it to be. His assertions about keeping the U.S. out of the war soon turned
  out to be one of the hollowest of all the mockeries.</p>

  <p>These are the roots of the present nuclear threat.</p>

  <p>The arms race took on especially ominous significance when U.S. imperialism decided,
  practically at the end of World War II when the imminence of surrender by Japan was
  evident to the whole world, to unloose nuclear death and destruction on Nagasaki and
  Hiroshima. This was not an attempt to save U.S. or other lives. It was an attempt to
  establish a nuclear-military superiority based on a permanent monopoly.</p>

  <p>Against whom was it directed? Not against Japanese imperialism, which had been
  ruined and vanquished as had Nazi imperialism.</p>

  <p>It was directed instead against the USSR which, despite overwhelming odds, had
  vanquished the Nazi-fascist Axis and emerged as a great world socialist power. By
  virtue of that fact alone, and notwithstanding the anti-fascist alliance with the
  imperialist democracies, the USSR was once again put in the dock as the enemy.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter is that there has never been a real peace between
  imperialism and the socialist republics of the USSR. U.S. imperialism in particular has
  never, even during the best days of the alliance with the Soviet Union against Hitler,
  really and truly accommodated itself to the existence of the Soviet Union and its new
  social order. The emergence of the USSR as a nuclear power, which destroyed the
  illusion of U.S. world mastery through nuclear monopoly, intensified the struggle of
  the U.S. and its imperialist allies against the Soviet Union. There have been intervals
  of so-called peaceful coexistence. But every now and then over these past dangerous
  years an incident has come along which threatens to explode into a world holocaust.</p>

  <p>Let's take a look at one of these events.</p>

  <p>Beginning on Thursday evening, Sept. 1, 1983, and lasting for 36 long and almost
  unendurable hours, a crisis emerged in which it once again seemed that at any moment a
  nuclear holocaust could develop. What was the nature of the episode?</p>

  <p>As the whole world knows now, the U.S. accused the USSR of shooting down a civilian
  aircraft with 269 passengers aboard. According to the U.S., they were "murdered in cold
  blood," " with premeditation," "with malice aforethought," etc., etc. For 36 hours the
  population of the U.S. was kept hostage to an absolutely coordinated, pre-planned and
  meticulously executed barrage of media and press saturation.</p>

  <p>No opposing view was presented. The capitalist presidential candidates, usually so
  eager for publicity, were told to either get out of sight or make themselves
  inconspicuous by their absence.</p>

  <p>The Soviet Union was to be convicted of murder. The judge and the jury were to be
  the U.S. government, that is, the military-industrial complex of bankers, generals, and
  Big Oil. Swift punishment was demanded. The media, particularly ABC News Nightline,
  became the voice for the whipped-up elements in the population to demand tough measures
  for punishment. A so-called scientific poll of the public was said to run as high as
  20-to-1 for the tough measures. It appeared to be a buildup to show that the "grass
  roots" were for harsh measures while a "reluctant," now moderate-looking, Reagan was to
  finally give the order to retaliate.</p>

  <p>But that did not happen. It still is not clear where the crisis could have gone, how
  far it would have been permitted to proceed, and what stopped it.</p>

  <p>But on January 8, 1984 -- four long months after the crisis had subsided -- the
  <em>Washington Post Magazine</em> ran a feature story on the KAL which detailed how the
  whole incident had been managed by the vast U.S. intelligence gathering system.</p>

  <p>The conclusion of the article was that the whole event had been "an intelligence
  treasure trove" for the U.S. on how to penetrate Soviet air defenses. It listed a few
  of the many, many times over the last 30 years that U.S. aircraft have been downed over
  the Soviet Union, showing that violation of Soviet airspace is a deliberate and
  frequent occurrence and has resulted in 120 U.S. personnel known to be killed.</p>

  <p>The article told of the giant U.S. tracking station Cobra Judy aboard the ship
  Observation Island, which is stationed off the Kamchatka Peninsula and monitors the
  Soviet Far East. It quoted from two U.S. pilots who had flown scores of missions over
  the USSR and China, Edward Eskelson and Tom Bernard. Their plane, the RC135, is the
  type of spy plane that had flown over Soviet territory the night the KAL was shot down.
  They said that the National Security Agency adjusts the flight plans of these planes so
  that they deliberately violate Soviet territory, thereby gathering information on the
  Soviet response. "We believe that the entire sweep of events -- from the time the
  Soviets first began tracking KAL Flight 007 ... to the time of the shootdown -- was
  meticulously monitored and analyzed instantaneously by U.S. intelligence," wrote
  Eskelson and Bernard.</p>

  <p>Such information <strong>was</strong> not available during those initial days and
  hours of war hysteria, however. Then all the press would print told of the "innocent
  lives lost" and Soviet "savagery."</p>

  <p>This incident is like so many in the past which momentarily aroused a great deal of
  emotional response. Tragic though they may be, it is necessary to know, based on a
  century of experience that these episodes are mostly of a contrived character. Even
  when they are not, they have no independent historical significance.</p>

  <p>One must weigh them in the scales of the social evolution of capitalism as a whole.
  Viewed in that light one sees that their real significance lies in the fact that they
  inevitably set in motion a series of events which lead to a catastrophe and which
  cannot, except in rare instances, be reversed through peaceful means.</p>

  <p>For instance, take the Gulf of Tonkin incident which should still be fresh in the
  minds of many. Has it really been that long since the U.S. press carried blazing
  headlines that North Vietnamese gunboats opened fire on U.S. naval forces stationed in
  the Gulf of Tonkin? Was it not President Lyndon Johnson, the State Department, and the
  Pentagon which issued the first reports on Aug. 4, 1964, and got the capitalist media
  to scream that the North Vietnamese had attacked U.S. destroyers on a routine
  intelligence-gathering trip in international waters?</p>

  <p>By Aug. 7, with the media helping the government, the Congress was dragooned into
  passing the Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorizing the administration to take "all
  necessary measures to repel attacks against U.S. forces." The result? Some 50,000
  American lives lost and millions of Southeast Asian people killed by U.S. guns, planes,
  and tanks.</p>

  <p>But let us take a more distant incident.</p>

  <p>What was the meaning of the shot at Sarajevo on June 28, 1914? That was the day
  Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austrian throne, was assassinated along with
  his wife by a Serbian nationalist. How many times in history have dukes, princes,
  monarchs, even czars, been assassinated? Was such an incident the result of an
  individual from an oppressed country attempting to strike back at an oppressor, a
  representative of the Austro-Hungarian Empire? Was such an incident responsible for
  setting in motion the first worldwide imperialist holocaust?</p>

  <p>Today, the heirs of the Austro-Hungarian Empire are gone. The empire itself has
  gone. The monarchies have bit the dust. And none in Austria, Hungary, or
  Bosnia-Herzegovina where the assassination took place (now part of Yugoslavia) mourn
  the loss of either the Archduke or the monarchy. The incident in and of itself,
  divorced from the pattern of social development, has absolutely no significance in the
  scale of history. The loss of two lives could scarcely be justification for the deaths
  of millions more in the war, not even in the minds of the most fanatical of the
  followers and lackeys of the Hapsburg monarchy.</p>

  <p>Yet the incident has to be weighed not in isolation but as a product of the entire
  course of development of imperialist policy which grew out of the evolution of
  capitalist competition into aggressive, expansionist, colonialist, racist, predatory
  imperialism. The assassination can only be evaluated in the light of the subsequent
  evolution of imperialist rivalry into imperialist war.</p>

  <p>Confining oneself to merely the political or military manifestations of imperialism
  without understanding its basic nature is an exercise in futility. This can only
  obscure the real character, the actual inherent tendencies, of the contemporary stage
  of U.S. nuclear-military-imperialist strategy.</p>

  <p>Certain elements in the bourgeois intelligentsia have time and again declared that
  in the nuclear-space age all philosophies and all theories concerning the development
  of contemporary society are irrelevant. They hold that science and technology,
  particularly as represented by the nuclear and outer-space weapons systems that are
  already in place, make any theory of society valid only if it divests itself of every
  kind of "special interest" and makes the struggle against nuclear war preeminent.</p>

  <p>And who indeed would be against making the struggle against nuclear war the highest
  priority?</p>

  <p>What class in capitalist society, however, has been able to abandon its own class
  interests in the interest of combating nuclear war? Has the bourgeoisie? On the
  contrary, it not only has not abandoned its ideological assault upon society and the
  workers and oppressed in particular, it has utilized the nuclear threat to intensify
  that assault.</p>

  <p>All talk of the irrelevance of contemporary ideology in relation to the
  extraordinary advances in science, technology, and above all nuclear and space
  developments reduces itself to an attempt to induce the independent working class and
  oppressed people, especially their vanguard organizations, to abandon their "special
  interests" in the struggle against capitalist exploitation and imperialist oppression.
  This does not bring us one iota nearer to eliminating the nuclear threat but, on the
  contrary, makes it more imminent.</p>

  <p>It is with this in view that we ought to examine the opposing views of the
  fundamental political currents in the struggle against imperialist war in general and
  nuclear war in particular.</p>

  <p>Both Marxists and pacifists are opposed to war. Both Marxists and pacifists seek
  peaceful solutions in order to avoid war, even though it is often said that the
  fundamental difference between Marxists and pacifists is that the latter are
  unequivocally and inflexibly opposed to the use of all violence. On the other hand, it
  is maintained that Marxists rely almost exclusively on the use of violence.</p>

  <p>There are a great variety of pacifists, ranging from humanists to Christian
  socialists to some who even say they espouse Marxism. Of course, only the most dogmatic
  of pacifists are against the use of violence anywhere and everywhere. Some of the more
  progressive ones have shown flexibility and at least agree that in some cases, mostly
  in a war of an oppressed people, it is justified to take up arms.</p>

  <p>Marxists, on the other hand, have never rejected peaceful means out of hand, if it
  could be demonstrated that the objective could be obtained that way and the road was
  clearly open for such a course of action. Who except those who have taken leave of
  their senses would prefer the use of violence if peaceful means were just as accessible
  and successful? Would any real union of workers prefer a strike if their demands could
  be obtained just as easily by negotiations?</p>

  <p>There is, however, a very crucial and fundamental difference between Marxism and
  pacifism. Marxists differ from all varieties of pacifists in that they take as their
  initial point of analysis the class character of a given society. This is necessary in
  order to determine whose interests the state serves.</p>

  <p>Pacifists take the view that the state in contemporary capitalist society can be
  either good or evil. They espouse the wholly erroneous conception that it is the nature
  of violence itself that stands in the way of a just, equitable, and prosperous society.
  In their view, the nature of society flows from the conceptions which prevail within
  that society. Marxists on the other hand hold the view that the prevailing ideas of
  society flow from its class character.</p>

  <p>"The prevailing ideas of any time," said Marx, "are the ideas of the ruling class."
  Thus in capitalist society the prevailing conceptions in politics and philosophy as
  well as in morals are the product of and serve the interests of the ruling
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>It is not true that pacifists and Marxists only differ in their tactics or methods.
  On the contrary it is their divergence in tactics that often discloses fundamentally
  different goals.</p>

  <p>One of the most profound characteristics of Marxist methodology is that it never
  divorces or isolates the means from the ends. They are interdependent. This is not
  recognized by the pacifists, who look upon the state as a means in capitalist society,
  as something like an empty bag which can be filled with any social content regardless
  of the exploitation and oppression which this supposed means, namely the bourgeois
  state, visits upon the working class and oppressed. The pacifists maintain that the
  state is or can be above the class struggle. Marxists, on the other hand, affirm that
  the state is an expression of the irreconcilable class antagonisms which are constantly
  tearing capitalist society apart.</p>

  <p>Marxists hold the view that the state is a repressive force and by its nature rests
  on naked violence. Pacifists, however, reject this view, despite centuries of
  experience which unequivocally demonstrate that in every great crisis of society, in
  every case where the oppressed masses have challenged the ruling class, force has been
  used as the instrument to subdue and suppress the masses.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the ruling classes have always insisted that the masses be imbued
  with pacifism, prayer and nonviolence as a means of continuing their monstrous
  oppression and exploitation.</p>

  <p>Marx demonstrated that "force is the midwife to every great social revolution." Even
  political revolutions, that is, revolutions for independence and national sovereignty
  which may only change the form of state, are also accompanied by violence. It should be
  remembered that both revolutions in the U.S. -- the one for independence as well as the
  Civil War which was a social revolution that changed the form of property relations,
  i.e., from chattel slavery to wage slavery -- came as the result of the revolutionary
  use of violence.</p>

  <p>Lenin carried on a relentless struggle against not only the pacifism of non-Marxists
  in general, that is, bourgeois pacifism in all its varieties, but also against those
  who subscribed to socialist doctrine and in a general way adhered to Marxism, but had
  abandoned its revolutionary content.</p>

  <p>The latter abandoned Marxism when the bourgeoisie launched the first imperialist
  world war, a period of great social and political crisis, when the bourgeoisie got the
  upper hand over the working class. In addition to taking millions of lives, that war
  wrought havoc in the working-class movement and for a period of time blotted out
  revolutionary class consciousness and proletarian internationalism in Europe and
  elsewhere. Drawing on this tragic but vital experience, Lenin brought back to light
  Marx's conception that the capitalist state is an instrument of suppression no matter
  what form it takes, whether that of a bourgeois democracy, a monarchy, or a military or
  fascist dictatorship.</p>

  <p>World War I proved that it didn't matter whether the form of state was a czarist
  autocracy like in Russia, a limited monarchy, as in Germany, a full-fledged bourgeois
  democracy like in France, or a military form of rule as in Turkey.</p>

  <p>Finally, the war disclosed that force on a huge scale is not an accidental factor in
  the evolution of capitalist society. On the contrary capitalist war is a
  <strong>function</strong> of the capitalist state, which in turn is the executive organ
  of the ruling class. Just as in the human anatomy there is no vital organ without a
  function, so it is in the social organism of capitalism. The capitalist state is a
  vital organ in the sociological anatomy of capitalist society, and one of its main
  functions is the waging of capitalist war.</p>

  <p>Why do capitalist governments launch destructive wars? Pacifists say it is because
  they lack reasonable men in government or because they lack moral values, clarity of
  aims, political foresight, or intellectual acumen. All these things may be part and
  parcel of and accompany the development and prosecution of a capitalist war. But these
  are not the driving forces of war. They are merely superficial aspects of the war.</p>

  <p>What drives the capitalists to war is the very nature of their social system, a
  system based on the wresting of super-profits from the hides of the workers and
  oppressed, that is, capitalist exploitation and imperialist oppression.</p>

  <p>The pacifists deny that these grow organically out of the social system. Marxists,
  however, proceed on the basis that the politics of the capitalist system cannot be
  separated from the economics of the system. Capitalist exploitation and oppression of
  the workers and oppressed people at home make exploitation and oppression abroad an
  inseparable and indispensable necessity. The two are tied together in one knot and any
  attempt to separate them can only result in a fatal, bankrupt anti-war policy which by
  its misleading tactics really facilitates the prosecution of capitalist war rather than
  stops it.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless it is false to say that Marxists and pacifists cannot work together
  against capitalist war in such areas as are possible and permissible for both.</p>

  <p>There are, however, times in the anti-war struggle when it becomes painfully clear
  that the Marxist approach, notwithstanding the participation of Marxists, progressive
  workers, and militants of many varieties, is completely drowned out by pacifist
  propaganda. In fact, Marxists can even forget their Marxism in the course of some
  exciting and impressive anti-war demonstrations against a developing war. Even some of
  the most advanced and class-conscious workers can become overwhelmed by an imperialist
  ideological and political onslaught that utilizes some international incident like the
  downing of the KAL spy plane to ignite, spread, and cultivate a spirit of jingoism and
  chauvinism.</p>

  <p>It is important to go over at least two examples, which stand out as clear as
  crystal.</p>

  <p>The first regards the KAL affair. The totalitarian, political control and
  monopolization of the means of communication by the Reagan-CIA-military-industrial
  complex in the early hours and days of September 1983 offers a dramatic and highly
  significant lesson for the anti-war movement in general and the anti-nuclear forces in
  particular. Nobody from the sizable anti-nuclear movement was either trying to or was
  capable of penetrating the imperialist electronic networks or the large capitalist
  newspapers. When somebody from the anti-nuclear forces was finally given a brief few
  moments on ABC News Nightline a week after the incident, the position taken was so weak
  and timid and in fundamental agreement on the alleged basic guilt of the USSR that it
  really seemed to bolster the fraudulent case put up by the Pentagon and the White
  House. An article in the <em>New York Times</em> of September 9 by a representative of
  <em>Nuclear Times</em> magazine was again clearly the type of pro-imperialist dissent
  which plays into the hands of the Pentagon propaganda machine.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter is that the anti-nuclear movement and the millions upon
  millions who are opposed to the launching of a nuclear war by the U.S. were left
  completely leaderless in the most critical hours of this dangerous episode.</p>

  <p>Even if the capitalist press were completely closed to them, it could have been
  possible to rally the movement with their own not inconsiderable independent resources.
  This, however, was not done. The leadership was completely paralyzed.</p>

  <p>It was not only fear that prevented them from doing anything in a moment of great
  crisis for which they should have been prepared. On the contrary many of them are
  distinguished by unusual devotion and courage. The paralysis which gripped the
  leadership was not of a psychological character. The vacillation and indecision were
  the result of a well-known social phenomenon which particularly manifests itself during
  periods of acute political crisis when ideology is tested in the crucible of momentous
  events.</p>

  <p>The crisis imperiously demands a definitive stand -- to open a struggle or to stand
  paralyzed in the face of an unmitigated assault by the very forces of blatant reaction
  and war which the movement is pledged to struggle against to the end. Why then this
  social and political paralysis at a time of crisis. It is not only the petty-bourgeois,
  middle-class character of the movement that is responsible.</p>

  <p>Throughout the whole life cycle of capitalism the petty-bourgeoisie has been known
  to vacillate between the working-class position and the capitalist-imperialist
  position. In times of great crisis they always gravitate to whichever side appears
  stronger and more formidable. They also can be progressive during a period when the
  class struggle is dormant and when they can easily aspire to leadership of the
  movement.</p>

  <p>But with a crucial world issue like the nuclear struggle, the ultimate,
  insurmountable obstacle is that the petty-bourgeois leadership of the movement leans
  particularly heavily on and is indissolubly tied to the liberal bourgeoisie, to its
  political representatives, and occasionally to those liberal bourgeois elements who
  themselves are leaders in finance and industry and captains of multi-national
  corporations.</p>

  <p>The Harrimans, the Watsons, the Vances, and others have not only formulated policy
  in administrations considered more "liberal" on world issues, but they represent a
  formidable, though diminishing, element in the hierarchy of the capitalist
  establishment. They are always ready to present "peaceful solutions," sometimes quite
  vociferously. But what they mean is a peaceful <strong>imperialist</strong> solution.
  Their umbilical cord to imperialism can never be untied.</p>

  <p>Individuals here or there may abandon their own personal interests and loyalty to
  their class and go over to the side of the oppressed, to the camp of anti-imperialism
  and socialism. But the class grouping itself, the liberal bourgeoisie as a whole,
  cannot do this. Even were they to try they would be overridden by the combination of
  the ever-increasing rightists and ultra-rightists in the capitalist establishment.</p>

  <p>The political line of the pacifists is basically an appeal to reason, much like
  those pleas made in the past, often by some of the most brilliant intellects of their
  time. The bourgeois liberals however cannot transcend their class grouping, certainly
  not as a group and not as a class.</p>

  <p>The anti-nuclear movement has wholly tied itself to this type of political
  conception, which is an antediluvian form of pacifism, an 18th-century appeal to
  reason. As Engels demonstrated in his celebrated <em>Socialism: Utopian and
  Scientific</em>(Anti-Duhring),<a href="#fn1">[1]</a> <a name="ret1" id="ret1"></a> the
  particular reasoning of any age represents the reasoning of a particular class in
  society. It may be advanced and certainly far more rational than the preceding
  exploiting class, but it is still, nevertheless, a reflection of basic class
  interests.</p>

  <p>Marx, for instance, refers to Aristotle, the most encyclopedic mind of ancient
  Greece, the intellectual titan of the ancient world. Why, asks Marx in his analysis of
  the nature of a commodity, could Aristotle not see that when commodities are exchanged
  their common denominator (after their use values are abstracted from their concrete
  form) is disclosed as undifferentiated human labor? Why couldn't a thinker with such an
  acute and deep insight into so many phenomena see that? Because in a society where
  slavery was the basis for the existence of the ruling class, such a vision of the
  equality of labor was impossible.</p>

  <p>While this was true for Aristotle in the time of ancient slavery, one would think
  that many centuries later, during the French and American revolutions and the epoch of
  the rising bourgeoisie, the notion of equality might possibly have gone beyond being a
  mere reflection of class interests, that is, the class interests of the bourgeoisie, so
  that equality would mean social and political equality for all, not just for a
  particular class.</p>

  <p>But did it?</p>

  <p>Thomas Jefferson, a great bourgeois revolutionary for his time, went the furthest in
  pushing the notion of equality as stated in the Declaration of Independence, "All men
  are created equal." But his position as a slave owner and representative of his class,
  particularly the Virginian slavocracy, prevented him from going further than purely
  legal, formal equality for white men. Jefferson produced voluminous writings, many of
  which deal with science, history, and philosophy. He not only spoke French, German, and
  Italian but also knew Greek, Latin, and other languages and was one of the most learned
  men of his age. He nevertheless had this to say regarding slavery in his <em>Notes on
  Virginia:</em><a href="#fn2">[2]</a> <a name="ret2" id="ret2"></a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>To our reproach it must be said that though for a century and a half we have had
    under our eyes the races of black and of red men, they have never yet been viewed by
    us as subjects of natural history. I advance it, therefore, as a suspicion only that
    the blacks, whether originally a distinct race or made distinct by time and
    circumstances, are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and of
    mind.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson are the heroes of the modern liberal bourgeoisie
  and the Democratic Party, in particular. The Democratic Party still sponsors
  Jefferson-Jackson Day dinners, particularly during election years, to give itself a
  liberal image. The modern liberal bourgeoisie in the epoch of imperialism is just as
  securely tied to its class position as Jefferson or Jackson were to theirs.</p>

  <p>For the anti-nuclear movement and for the anti-war movement in general to tie its
  destiny to the liberal bourgeoisie and its politicians, whose class affinity to the
  more reactionary elements in the bourgeoisie is becoming ever more secure, makes
  winning the anti-war struggle by the movement as a whole impossible to achieve. While
  their dedication and sincerity in opposing the war danger may be beyond question, their
  actual ability to be effective, to be able to seriously engage in activities,
  particularly in times of acute crisis, <strong>to stop the war,</strong> to really
  fight it tooth and nail, is totally out of the question in light of their ideological
  and social ties to the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>The second event we must analyze took place on a now historic date, June 12, 1982,
  when the city of New York was the scene of the largest anti-war demonstration in the
  history of the United States. The specifics of the program of the demonstration were
  directed against the threat of nuclear war and for a freeze on nuclear weapons More
  immediately, it was to stop the deployment in Europe of Pershing II and cruise missiles
  and the development of the most threatening of all U.S. weapons, the MX first-strike
  missile.</p>

  <p>The demonstration was widely heralded as the most successful ever. Almost all the
  capitalist newspapers said that perhaps as many as 500,000-800,000 attended. The more
  progressive papers and those in the working-class movement gave it almost a
  million.</p>

  <p>But there was an extraordinary aspect to this demonstration that seemed to escape
  the attention of the organizers and, in particular, the scores of speakers who
  delivered short messages and greetings during the day-long demonstration. There were
  perhaps as many as a hundred speakers, and most of them were well aware of what was
  going on in the world. Yet they omitted to mention (or if they did so it was in such a
  perfunctory way as to be completely overlooked in all accounts of the event, the war of
  devastating proportions going on in Lebanon at that very moment.</p>

  <p>On that very day there was already in progress one of the cruelest, most barbarous,
  if not genocidal wars of U.S. imperialism. The fact that the actual fighting was being
  carried out by its surrogate Israel should have fooled no one. The war was being
  conducted against one of the most oppressed and persecuted peoples of the century --
  the Palestinians. No one could avoid seeing it on television, hearing about it on the
  radio, or reading the banner headlines in the world or U.S. press.</p>

  <p>The first wave of the terrible invasion by the Israelis began on June 5 and
  continued, with merciless destruction, all the way to June 15-16. An eight-column
  banner headline in the <em>New York Times</em> of June 7 read, "Big Israeli force
  invades south Lebanon, sharp fighting with guerrillas reported." Two days later a
  similar dramatic headline said that now the Israelis were only 15 miles outside Beirut
  and were using tanks and infantry in an evident attempt to trap and destroy the
  Palestinians. It was substantially the same on June 12, 13, and 14.</p>

  <p>It would have been utterly impossible for any speaker to have denied knowledge of
  what was going on. The newspapers and the media were full of it worldwide. Yet the
  speakers, with the possible exception of one or two, all hewed to the
  bourgeois-pacifist line. They spoke only about the threat of <strong>nuclear</strong>
  war and completely closed their eyes to the war that was literally in front of them. It
  was as though the imperialist architects of this war were not inseparably bound up with
  the very same imperialist forces that are promoting nuclear war.</p>

  <p>All that was really needed was a clear and simple resolution denouncing the
  U.S.-Israeli war being waged against the Palestinians and the Lebanese. No one would
  have demanded that the U.S.-Israeli war against the Palestinians and Lebanese be the
  focus of the demonstration. But a clear denunciation of the war in the form of a
  resolution could hardly have escaped the attention of the world press, even if the U.S.
  press tried to hide it.</p>

  <p>Showing that this was not an isolated error on the part of the organizers of this
  demonstration, they failed to take note of and denounce another imperialist war which
  was reaching a dramatic climax almost at the same time. On the same day, the
  reactionary British government, with its mighty nuclear fleet, was carrying on a
  terrible war of destruction in its effort to retake its colonial possession, the
  Malvinas Islands, from Argentina.</p>

  <p>There was hardly any comment in the radical press on the failure of the anti-nuclear
  movement to condemn the ghastly Beirut massacres of a whole people. Most treated the
  war and the nuclear issue as totally separate developments, as though one had little to
  do with the other. What imperialism was doing with its right hand seemed to be of no
  concern or of little relevance to what it was doing with its left hand. It was as
  though the violence were from two separate sociological and political entities.</p>

  <p>For example, a long article in the social democratic newspaper <em>In These
  Times</em> of June 30-July 13 by David Moberg analyzing the demonstration was full of
  effusive praise of the unity and solidarity shown. The article did not contain a word
  about the contradiction between letting imperialism mercilessly destroy the lives and
  homes of an oppressed people while expounding the main theme of the protest -- the
  growing nuclear danger and support for a nuclear freeze. There was no word about the
  struggle of the besieged people of Palestine or the Arabs in general.</p>

  <p>The <em>Guardian,</em> which styles itself as an independent radical newsweekly, in
  an editorial in its June 23 issue called the demonstration a "historic turning point."
  In what way was it really a turning point? It was historic in that it was so huge. But
  what about its effectiveness in light of its clear avoidance of one of the most
  monstrous examples of imperialist slaughter? The <em>Guardian</em> failed to mention
  the glaring discrepancy that such a huge anti-war demonstration could take place in the
  midst of a genocidal imperialist war and never even mention that it was going on.
  Covering the story of the horrors of the Mideast war by shunting it off to a separate
  and less significant part of the paper was a cop-out. Doing it that way was like
  creating two different compartments out of the same imperialist pattern and cultivating
  the pernicious illusion that one had nothing to do with the other. This is precisely
  what the imperialist bourgeoisie had assiduously drummed into the heads of the masses
  during that long horrendous week.</p>

  <p>It is no accident that the <em>Guardian</em> also became overwhelmed by bourgeois
  prejudice in the spy plane episode. Their editorial in the September 14, 1983, issue
  repeated many of the arguments of the capitalist media, calling the incident a "double
  tragedy" and attacking the Soviet Union for what it claimed to be a "completely
  uncalled for reaction." Their position amounted to a complete capitulation to Reaganite
  reaction in the midst of this ominous war crisis. The fact that the <em>Guardian, In
  These Times,</em> and a whole slew of other so-called progressives took their cue from
  the ruling class proves again that Marx was right -- the prevailing ideas of any time
  are the ideas of the ruling class.</p>

  <p>Of course, it was very important that the June 12 demonstration be vigorously
  supported by all progressives and Marxists with an independent anti-imperialist
  working-class line. It was, however, a thoroughly bourgeois pacifist demonstration
  which proved to be entirely harmless to the Pentagon's plans for war. And, sure enough,
  it was only some months later that the Democratic-controlled House as well as the
  Republican-controlled Senate passed the necessary appropriations for the development of
  the dreaded MX first-strike missile, whose defeat had been a key point in the program
  of this giant peace demonstration.</p>

  <p>The coordinators and the speakers at June 12 not only completely separated
  capitalist politics from capitalist economics and imperialist foreign policy from
  reactionary domestic policy, but they carried on a rhetorical exercise with many dearly
  beloved peace platitudes and empty abstractions. Lo and behold, even some of the
  reactionaries and avowed warmongers later either appropriated these phrases or gave
  them a particular twist so that whatever meaning they had was lost.</p>

  <p>To separate imperialist policy in arms control from imperialism and the subjugation
  of oppressed peoples by the most cruel force was clearly the tragic policy of the
  organizers and coordinators of the demonstration. While the murderous bombing was going
  on and the speech-making was taking place before a huge demonstration in Central Park,
  eight imperialist leaders were gathering at precisely the same time in Paris in one of
  their annual meetings. The heads of state of the U.S., Britain, France, West Germany,
  Canada, Japan, Belgium, and Italy were meeting in secret and only letting out just
  enough of what in their view the public should know.</p>

  <p>There in Paris they agreed that the Israelis should pull back somewhat from their
  assault on the Lebanese and Palestinian people so as to make room for their
  multi-national imperialist force to enter the area, replace the Israeli invaders and
  push them somewhat into the background. These imperialist brigands needed a
  multilateral force for their own predatory interests in this small country of Lebanon,
  which was reduced to rubble only because of their imperialist interests.</p>

  <p>The leader of this imperialist caravan was of course to be the Reagan
  administration. Later on, the Socialist -- what a tortured word it has become! --
  Mitterrand was to begin massive airlifting of paratroopers to the small African country
  of Chad. There the U.S. had taken upon itself a so-called mercy mission of protecting
  the Chadians against supposed aggression from Libya. It did so with a huge naval armada
  steaming near the Gulf of Sidra and giant AWACS spy planes flying into Egypt and the
  Sudan aimed against the rebellious Chadians as well as the Libyans.</p>

  <p>The purpose of all this was to strengthen the ties among the imperialists for the
  next phase of the struggle in Lebanon. Clearly the imperialists had made it their task
  to either partition the country or take it over completely by force of arms.</p>

  <p>But what happened thereafter should be as illuminating to the pacifists,
  Social-Democrats of all stripes, and progressives generally, as it was so onerous and
  oppressive for the Lebanese people against whom the so-called U.S. peace-keeping force
  was aimed. The "peace-keepers" finally unmasked themselves, together with the French,
  and opened fire on the Lebanese people on September 7, 1983. The dazed U.S. Marines who
  were assured, as was the U.S. public, that this was a peace-keeping mission, were
  finally brought to reality when the Lebanese people returned the fire.</p>

  <p>The Marines might well have said, as did the mythical cartoon character Pogo, "We
  have discovered the enemy. It is us."</p>

  <p>Not only the Marines, but the U.S. capitalist establishment and the public at large
  were finally given the first real opening to see with their own eyes that the U.S.
  government was again at war without a declaration by Congress as expressly stated in
  the Constitution.</p>

  <p>We thus see that what was happening at the time of the June 12 demonstration was a
  war for the recolonization of the Malvinas, an imperialist-instigated war against the
  Palestinians and the Lebanese, a U.S.-French operation in Chad, and at the same time an
  intervention and blockade of Central America. Never to be forgotten, and almost always
  underplayed, are the tremendous events also going on in southern Africa, Namibia,
  besieged Angola, Mozambique, and Ethiopia.</p>

  <p>Are not these imperialist wars, which the bourgeoisie and the capitalist press refer
  to as local wars, <strong>intimately connected and indissolubly bound up with the
  preparation for nuclear war against the USSR?</strong> Did not the so-called local wars
  of 1912 in the Balkans lead to World War I, a war for colonial booty and division of
  markets among the imperialist powers?</p>

  <p>Did not World War I demonstrate that the struggle which the imperialist powers carry
  on abroad is inseparably connected to and really an extension of the same war which
  these very imperialists carry on in the form of the class struggle against the workers
  and oppressed at home?</p>

  <p>All theories must pass the crucial test of experience. Experience alone is the true
  test of the scientific validity of any theoretical proposition.</p>

  <p>Two significant developments, two really momentous events -- the war against Lebanon
  and the Korean spy plane episode -- two phases in the world struggle of imperialism
  against the oppressed people and the socialist countries proved the utter inability of
  the pacifist, neo-social-democratic leaders to rise to the occasion, to be an effective
  instrument in the struggle, or even to show signs of resistance on a modest scale. The
  movement as a whole, composed of many, many millions, must be distinguished from the
  leaders.</p>

  <p>The divorce of leaders from the progressive elements of society and their capture by
  the insidious forces of big business and high finance is one of the elements born of
  the antagonistic character of the class contradictions in capitalist society.</p>

  <p>Should the working class and oppressed fall prey to and become followers of the
  bourgeois, neo-social-democratic trend even before they have the opportunity to
  reinvigorate themselves and rise from a debilitating capitalist crisis, it would be a
  tragic repetition of the experience of the Second International in its hour of great
  crisis.</p>

  <p>Right up to the last moment, practically on the eve of the outbreak of World War I,
  the leaders of the Second International were meeting and discussing what to do in the
  light of the ultimatum which the Austrians gave to the Serbians demanding a complete
  capitulation. Even as the German, French, and Russian armies were beginning to move,
  nothing but paralysis seemed to reign supreme in this body of leaders whom the working
  class of a whole continent had endowed with its confidence in the struggle against
  imperialist war. They did not take the necessary action to oppose by legal and illegal
  means the thoroughly mendacious, thoroughly anti-human unleashing of a holocaust whose
  effects were to continue for generations.</p>

  <p>It was to Lenin's great credit that he led his party in an opposite direction, in
  the direction of urging the masses not only to oppose the war but to call it by its
  right name. The other leaders of the Second International failed to do this, as do
  their counterparts today.</p>

  <p>Why did the Second International end up in ruins?</p>

  <p>Certainly among the most important reasons is the fact that, notwithstanding that
  they stood at least in words on the platform of working-class struggle, they failed to
  see that the only antidote to an imperialist war is the development of a class war, and
  that a class war in the midst of an imperialist war inevitably means defeating the
  armies of the ruling class by overturning its rule. This the leaders of the Second
  International had agreed to in words, as late as two years before the First World War
  broke out.</p>

  <p>Where Lenin's more profound understanding of the class struggle and of imperialism
  in general proved itself superior was where he went beyond both the pacifism of
  bourgeois liberals as well as the pacifism of the various socialist parties on the
  European continent. In his view, the imperialist war was just a continuation of
  imperialist politics by other (violent) means. While not for a moment abandoning any
  type of peaceful demonstrations against the war, he resolutely and with determination
  pushed his own formula for a solution to the imperialist war: "A revolutionary class in
  a reactionary war cannot but desire the defeat of its own (capitalist) government. The
  defeat of one's own government in an imperialist war is the lesser evil." Only in that
  way can there be a real fraternization collectively of the workers in the imperialist
  countries against the war.</p>

  <p>Just as energetically, however, Lenin relentlessly agitated for and defended the
  correctness of a revolutionary war of the oppressed people and urged revolutionary
  defeatism by the workers in the oppressing imperialist countries. He urged upon the
  workers in the oppressing imperialist countries fraternal support and anti-imperialist
  solidarity, up to and including revolutionary measures that would facilitate the defeat
  of the imperialist government.</p>

  <p>A century of imperialist struggle has not invalidated but really confirmed the
  correctness of the principled, revolutionary Marxist-Leninist tactics and strategical
  approach. Local conditions and temporary lulls in the class struggle may necessitate a
  diversity of different tactical approaches. They must, however, be in harmony with the
  principled revolutionary working-class position of anti-imperialist struggle.</p>

  <p>What is the social content of imperialist aggression? It is for super-profits at
  home and abroad. It is the congenital drive of the bourgeoisie for super-exploitation
  which is the source of the super-profits.</p>

  <p>For popular consumption and to deceive the masses, the struggle for markets, sources
  of raw materials, and conditions favorable for super-exploitation is often masked in
  idealistic terms as a mission to repel aggression or to "democratize" this or that
  country. But more often than not these days it is put in naked military terms.</p>

  <p>Does this not explain why retired Admiral Elmo Zumwalt demanded of a Congressional
  hearing in blunt terms that "We need aircraft carriers for the Third World and nuclear
  submarines against the Soviet Union"?</p>

  <p>It should be noted that Congress, notwithstanding the anti-nuclear movement and the
  anti-war sentiment of the majority of the people, granted to the military not only
  funds for the further development of the MX missile but also the major weapons system
  known as the B-1 bomber and the even more costly Trident nuclear submarine.</p>

  <p>Of course, Congress has on occasion postponed one weapons system in favor of
  another. The hidden cause behind the change is usually not due to any swift changes in
  public opinion but to the fact that one group of weapons systems manufacturers has
  gotten the upper hand over another and has gotten the blessings of the Pentagon, which
  in turn has manipulated the necessary votes in the Congress.</p>

  <p>These giant multi-national monopolies are more powerful than any ancient empire ever
  was. There are even few modern imperialist states that can rival the power of one of
  the dynastic finance capitalist groupings which bankroll the various weapons systems.
  They relentlessly milk the U.S. Treasury which in turn passes on its losses to the
  masses of the working class and oppressed.</p>

  <p>If the struggle against imperialist war is to become serious, it must take on a
  working-class character. That doesn't mean to narrow the appeal, as capitalist
  politicians maintain. On the contrary, it means to broaden it, for it is the working
  class and the oppressed people together with the lower middle class that constitute the
  majority in any case.</p>

  <p>Taking on a working-class character means that the fundamental aim of the anti-war
  struggle is not merely against the military-industrial complex, but also the defense
  contractors and the big banks, as well as the giant oil corporations. In a word, the
  struggle against imperialist war must be conducted as an all-around classwide struggle
  against the bourgeoisie. Only a real class war can stop an imperialist war and has the
  material basis for winning the allegiance of all the oppressed and exploited
  masses.</p>
