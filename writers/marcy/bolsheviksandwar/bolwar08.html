  <h1><small>Appendix II</small><br />
  Manifesto of the International Socialist Congress at
  Basel</h1>

  <p>At its congresses at Stuttgart and Copenhagen the International formulated for the
  proletariat of all countries these guiding principles for the struggle against war:</p>

  <p>If a war threatens to break out, it is the duty of the working classes and their
  parliamentary representatives in the countries involved supported by the coordinating
  activity of the International Socialist Bureau to <strong>exert every effort in order
  to prevent the outbreak of war by the means they consider most effective,</strong>
  which naturally vary according to the sharpening of the class struggle and the
  sharpening of the general political situation.</p>

  <p>In case war should break out anyway it is their duty <strong>to intervene in favor
  of its speedy termination</strong> and with all their powers to utilize <strong>the
  economic and political crisis created by the war to arouse the people and thereby to
  hasten the downfall of capitalist class rule.</strong></p>

  <p>More than ever, recent events have imposed upon the proletariat the duty of devoting
  the utmost force and energy to planned and concerted action. On the one hand, the
  universal craze for armaments has aggravated the high cost of living, thereby
  intensifying class antagonisms and creating in the working class an implacable spirit
  of revolt; the workers want to put a stop to this system of panic and waste. On the
  other hand, the incessantly recurring menace of war has a more and more inciting
  effect. The great European peoples are constantly on the point of being driven against
  one another, although these attempts are against humanity and reason cannot be
  justified by even the slightest pretext of being in the interest of the people.</p>

  <p>If the Balkan crisis, which has already caused such terrible disasters, should
  spread further, it would become the most frightful danger to civilization and the
  proletariat. At the same time it would be the greatest outrage in all history because
  of the crying discrepancy between the immensity of the catastrophe and the
  insignificance of the interests involved.</p>

  <p>It is with satisfaction that the Congress records the complete unanimity of the
  Socialist parties and of the trade unions of all countries in the war against war.</p>

  <p>The proletarians of all countries have risen simultaneously in a struggle against
  imperialism; each section of the international has opposed the resistance of the
  proletariat to the government of its own country, and has mobilized the public opinion
  of its nation against all bellicose desires. Thus there resulted the grandiose
  cooperation of the workers of all countries which has already contributed a great deal
  toward saving the threatened peace of the world. The fear of the ruling class a of a
  proletarian revolution as a result of a world war has proved to be an essential
  guarantee of peace.</p>

  <p>The Congress therefore calls upon the Social-Democratic parties to continue their
  action by every means that seems appropriate to them. In this concerted action it
  assigns to each Socialist party its particular task.</p>

  <p>The Social-Democratic parties of the Balkan peninsula have a difficult task. The
  Great Powers of Europe, by the systematic frustration of all reforms, have contributed
  to the creation of unbearable economic, national and political conditions in Turkey
  which necessarily had to lead to revolt and war. Against the exploitation of these
  conditions in the interest of the dynasties and the bourgeois classes, the
  Social-Democratic parties of the Balkans, with heroic courage, have raised the demand
  for a democratic federation. The Congress calls upon them to persevere in their
  admirable attitude; it expects that the Social-Democracy of the Balkans will do
  everything after the war to prevent the results of the Balkan War attained at the price
  of such terrible sacrifices from being misused for their own purposes by dynasties, by
  militarism, by the bourgeoisie of the Balkan states greedy for expansion. The Congress,
  however, calls upon the Socialists of the Balkans particularly to resist not only the
  renewal of the old enmities between Serbs, Bulgars, Rumanians, and Greeks, but also
  every violation of the Balkan peoples now in the opposite camp, the Turks and the
  Albanians. It is the duty of the Socialists of the Balkans, therefore, to fight against
  every violation of the rights of these people and to proclaim the fraternity of all
  Balkans peoples including the Albanians, the Turks, and the Rumanians, against the
  unleashed national chauvinism.</p>

  <p>It is the duty of the Social-Democratic parties of Austria, Hungary, Croatia and
  Slavonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina to continue with all their power their effective
  action against an attack upon Serbia by the Danubian monarchy. It is their task to
  continue as in the past to oppose the plan of robbing Serbia of the results of the war
  by armed force, of transforming it into an Austrian colony, and of involving the
  peoples of Austria-Hungary proper and together with them all nations of Europe in the
  greatest dangers for the sake of dynastic interests. In the future the
  Social-Democratic parties of Austria-Hungary will also fight in order that those
  sections of the South-Slavic people ruled by the House of Hapsburg may obtain the right
  to govern themselves democratically within the boundaries of the Austro-Hungarian
  monarchy proper.</p>

  <p>The Social-Democratic parties of Austria-Hungary as well as the Socialists of Italy
  must pay special attention to the Albanian question. The Congress recognizes the right
  of the Albanian people to autonomy but it protests against Albania, under the pretext
  of autonomy, becoming the victim of Austro-Hungarian and Italian ambitions for
  domination. The Congress sees in this not only a peril for Albania itself, but, in a
  short time, a menace to the peace between Austria-Hungary and Italy. Albania can lead a
  truly independent life only as an autonomous member of a democratic Balkan federation.
  The Congress therefore calls upon the Social-Democrats of Austria-Hungary and Italy to
  combat every attempt of their governments to envelop Albania in their sphere of
  influence and to continue their efforts to strengthen the peaceful relations between
  Austria-Hungary and Italy.</p>

  <p>It is with great joy that the Congress greets the protest strikes of Russian workers
  as a guarantee that the proletariat of Russia and of Poland is beginning to recover
  from the blows dealt it by the czarist counterrevolution. The Congress sees in this the
  strongest guarantee against the criminal intrigues of czarism, which, after having
  drowned in blood the peoples of its own country, after having betrayed the Balkan
  peoples themselves innumerable times and surrendered them to their enemies, now
  vacillates between the fear of the consequences that a war would have upon it and the
  fear of the pressure of a nationalist movement which it has itself created. However,
  when czarism now tries to appear as the liberator of the Balkan nations, it is only to
  reconquer its hegemony in the Balkans in a bloody war under this hypocritical pretext.
  The Congress expects that the urban and rural proletariat of Russia, Finland, and
  Poland, which is growing in strength, will destroy this web of lies, will oppose every
  belligerent venture of czarism, will combat every design of czarism, whether upon
  Armenia or upon Constantinople, and will concentrate its whole force upon the renewal
  of the revolutionary struggle for emancipation from czarism. For czarism is the hope of
  all the reactionary powers of Europe, the most terrible enemy of the democracy of the
  peoples dominated by it; and the achievement of its destruction must be viewed as one
  of the foremost tasks of the entire International.</p>

  <p>However, the most important task within the action of the International devolves
  upon the working class of Germany, France, and England. At this moment, it is the task
  of the workers of these countries to demand of their governments that they refuse any
  support either to Austria-Hungary or Russia, that they abstain from any intervention in
  the Balkan troubles and maintain absolute neutrality. A war between the three great
  leading civilized peoples on account of the Serbo-Austrian dispute over a port would be
  criminal insanity. The workers of Germany and France cannot concede that any obligation
  whatever to intervene in the Balkan conflict exists because of secret treaties.</p>

  <p>However, on further development, should the military collapse of Turkey lead to the
  downfall of the Ottoman rule in Asia Minor, it would be the task of the Socialists of
  England, France, and Germany to resist with all their power the policy of conquest in
  Asia Minor, which would inevitably lead in a straight line to war. The Congress views
  as the greatest danger to the peace of Europe the artificially cultivated hostility
  between Great Britain and the German Empire. The Congress therefore greets the efforts
  of the working class of both countries to bridge this hostility. It considers the best
  means for this purpose to be the conclusion of an accord between Germany and England
  concerning the limitation of naval armaments and the abolition of the right of naval
  booty. The Congress calls upon the Socialists of England and Germany to continue their
  agitation for such an accord.</p>

  <p>The overcoming of the antagonism between Germany on the one hand, and France and
  England on the other, would eliminate the greatest danger to the peace of the world,
  shake the power of czarism which exploits this antagonism, render an attack of
  Austria-Hungary upon Serbia impossible, and secure peace to the world. All the efforts
  of the International, therefore, are to be directed toward this goal.</p>

  <p>The Congress records that the entire Socialist International is unanimous upon these
  principles of foreign policy. It calls upon the workers of all countries to oppose the
  power of the international solidarity of the proletariat to capitalist imperialism. It
  warns the ruling classes of all states not to increase by belligerent actions the
  misery of the masses brought on by the capitalist method of production. It emphatically
  demands peace. Let the governments remember that with the present condition of Europe
  and the mood of the working class, they cannot unleash a war without danger to
  themselves. Let them remember that the Franco-German War was followed by the
  revolutionary outbreak of the Commune, that the Russo-Japanese War set into motion the
  revolutionary energies of the peoples of the Russian Empire, that the competition in
  military and naval armaments gave the class conflicts in England and on the Continent
  an unheard-of sharpness, and unleashed an enormous wave of strikes. It would be
  insanity for the governments not to realize that the very idea of the monstrosity of a
  world war would inevitably call forth the indignation and the revolt of the working
  class. The proletarians consider it a crime to fire at each other for the profits of
  the capitalists, the ambitions of dynasties, or the greater glory of secret diplomatic
  treaties.</p>

  <p>If the governments cut off every possibility of normal progress, and thereby drive
  the proletariat to desperate steps, they themselves will have to bear the entire
  responsibility for the consequences of the crisis brought about by them.</p>

  <p>The International will redouble its efforts in order to prevent this crisis; it will
  raise its protest with increasing emphasis and make its propaganda more and more
  energetic and comprehensive. The Congress therefore commissions the International
  Socialist Bureau to follow events with much greater attentiveness and no matter what
  may happen to maintain and strengthen the bonds uniting the proletarian parties.</p>

  <p>The proletariat is conscious of being at this moment the bearer of the entire future
  of humankind. The proletariat win exert all its energy to prevent the annihilation of
  the flower of all peoples, threatened by all the horrors of mass murder, starvation,
  and pestilence.</p>

  <p>The Congress therefore appeals to you, proletarians and Socialists of all countries,
  to make your voices heard in this decisive hour! Proclaim your will in every form and
  in all places; raise your protest in the parliaments with all your force; unite in
  great mass demonstrations; use every means that the organization and the strength of
  the proletariat place at your disposal! See to it that the governments are constantly
  kept aware of the vigilance and passionate will for peace on the part of the
  proletariat! To the capitalist world of exploitation and mass murder, oppose in this
  way the proletarian world of peace and fraternity of peoples!</p>
