  Zimmerwald: The internationalists regroup</h1>

  <p>A whole new world intervened between the historic Basel anti-war conference of the
  Socialist International held in November 1912 and the Zimmerwald conference held in
  Switzerland on September 4, 1915. The revolutionary call contained in the Basel
  Manifesto to utilize the war in order to overturn capitalist slavery was drowned in the
  blood of millions of people and was replaced by disgusting chauvinist calls to
  patriotism to struggle on behalf of each capitalist government against the brothers and
  sisters of the working class in other countries.</p>

  <p>All over Europe the wildest fanaticism aroused by imperialist predatory interests
  seemed to have silenced the revolutionary voice and blunted the will and determination
  of the working class. For every individual revolutionary antiwar fighter, there seemed
  to be hundreds, thousands espousing the cause of imperialism. The most hypocritical and
  shameless surrender of the official social democratic leadership left the millions
  ideologically and politically defenseless in the face of the assault of the
  chauvinists.</p>

  <p>The collapse of the Socialist International<a href="#fn1">[1]</a> <a name="ret1" id=
  "ret1"></a> and the frightening betrayal which was suddenly thrust upon the heads of
  millions of workers was probably the most staggering blow that could possibly have been
  delivered to the masses. They were utterly unprepared for this historic debacle. It is
  no wonder that confusion and demoralization in the initial stages helped the forces of
  chauvinism tie the working classes of Europe to the chariot wheels of the imperialist
  war.</p>

  <p>The whole question of the monstrous betrayal by social democracy has to be
  reexamined today in the light of contemporary conditions which seem so fundamentally
  different from what obtained in 1914.</p>

  <p>It took literally millions of lives, after the first salvo of the war on August 4,
  1914, to finally achieve another anti-war conference following the one at Basel. This
  time in the midst of the war, in the midst of chaos, disruption, arrests of hundreds
  and thousands of opponents of the war, and the difficulty of communication, a
  conference was finally convoked at Zimmerwald. The mere convening of the conference,
  the fact that it was held, was in itself an important event. At last, those who were
  against the war, or at least said they were, were coming together in one place to
  discuss what to do about it.</p>

  <p>The most prominent socialist leader in Europe who opposed the war was an elected
  representative to the German Reichstag, the well-known revolutionary socialist Karl
  Liebknecht. But there were other social democratic representatives who also voted
  against war credits, or the defense budget as it is called today, in their respective
  parliaments: Monatte in France and, rarely alluded to and often forgotten, the leaders
  of the Serbian Social Democratic Party (Ljattchevitch and Katzlerovitch) who took the
  same heroic position as Liebknecht in the Serbian Skuptchina (parliament).</p>

  <p>The Zimmerwald conference was formally called by the Swiss and Italian parties of
  the International. Switzerland was, of course, neutral. Italian imperialism had just
  recently entered the war, but only against Austria and Hungary, not as yet against
  Germany. Bulgaria and Rumania were not yet in it, but were dragged in later. Sweden
  also remained neutral. The Netherlands managed to stay out while garnering huge
  super-profits in what is now Indonesia.</p>

  <p>All told there were about 40 delegates from 11 countries at Zimmerwald, which in
  itself was a significant factor in demonstrating that the working class movement was on
  the road to recovering its revolutionary spirit and active opposition to the war.</p>

  <p>What came out of the Zimmerwald conference was an historic resolution. It had a lot
  more significance than the Basel conference, which had been held during peacetime. The
  Zimmerwald resolution (see Appendix for complete document) said that</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>"The war which has produced this chaos is the outcome of
    imperialism,</strong> of the attempt, on the part of the capitalist classes of each
    nation, to foster their greed for profit by the exploitation of human labor and of
    the natural treasures of the entire globe."</p>

    <p>It is, continued the resolution later on, "the capitalists of all countries who
    are coining the red gold of war-profits out of the blood shed by the people. ...
    [They] assert that the war is for defense of the fatherland, for democracy and the
    liberation of oppressed nations! They lie. <strong>In actual reality, they are
    burying the freedom of their own people together with the independence of the other
    nations</strong>. ... The ruling powers of capitalist society who held the fate of
    the nations in their hands ... bear the full weight of responsibility for this war.
    ..."(Emphasis in the original.)</p>

    <p>This includes, said the resolution, "the monarchic as well as the republican
    governments, the secret diplomacy, the mighty business organizations, the bourgeois
    parties, the capitalist press, the Church. ..."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It reminded the workers of the Stuttgart and Basel resolutions and called upon the
  proletarians of all countries to unite and fight against the war. It did not, however,
  do much to show how this should be implemented more concretely. It did not openly
  condemn the leadership of the Second International for their betrayal. And it did not
  join Lenin and the Bolsheviks in calling for the defeat of the capitalist governments,
  to turn the imperialist war into civil war. Nevertheless, Lenin and the Bolsheviks
  considered the Zimmerwald conference an important step in the struggle against the
  imperialist war. As far as it went, the resolution was correct in all respects and
  called upon the working class to put up a resolute struggle against the imperialist
  war. But it didn't go far enough.</p>

  <p>The most important question during war time is what to do to stop the war. The
  Bolshevik answer was as clear as crystal. Fight against the war by all necessary means
  with the general aim of converting the war of capitalist governments against each other
  into a war of the workers against the capitalists.</p>

  <p>The Bolsheviks nevertheless voted for the resolution, which was unanimously
  endorsed. They then introduced a resolution of their own (see Appendix for complete
  document) which contained the necessary additions, roundly condemning the leadership of
  the Second International who were "rotten with opportunism at the beginning of the
  World War and betrayed the proletariat to imperialism and gave up the principles of
  socialism and thereby the real struggle for the everyday interests of the proletariat."
  This resolution was defeated.</p>

  <p>By the time of the Zimmerwald conference the Bolsheviks had made considerable
  headway with revolutionary anti-war agitation not only in Russia but on the European
  continent as a whole. Among the left-wing groupings, the so-called Zimmerwaldians,
  Lenin on behalf of the Bolsheviks had very early in the war elaborated a clear-cut
  program. This was a distinct advantage not only against the right wing but also against
  the centrist groupings which, however strongly they might have opposed the war, were
  nonetheless weak in promoting what had to be done.</p>

  <p>In the first place, the Bolshevik representatives in the czarist Duma (the Russian
  "parliament") took a clear-cut anti-war position in contrast to the Mensheviks in the
  same Duma. As a result of their opposition to the war, the Bolshevik representatives
  were sent to Siberia and imprisoned. They were thus in the same revolutionary anti-war
  bloc with Liebknecht, who was imprisoned for his anti-war stand and his vote against
  war credits.</p>

  <p>The prestige of the Bolshevik grouping was growing enormously and at the same time
  the struggle in Russia was taking on a broader character, in some places violent in
  form. The Bolsheviks, however, did not rest their prestige on the heroic struggle which
  the Russian proletariat was putting up and which they represented so strongly. The
  Bolshevik delegation to Zimmerwald came with strong, invincible ideological armor. This
  is especially clear if one examines the basic pamphlet that Lenin had written (together
  with Zinoviev) in the summer of 1915 called <em>Socialism and War.</em><a href=
  "#fn2">[2]</a> <a name="ret2" id="ret2"></a> Having such a powerful ideological weapon
  in their hands made it easier to rally not only some of the leading figures in the
  struggle, but to appeal directly to the other social democratic organizations in Europe
  and even in Britain.</p>

  <p>Thus <em>Socialism and War</em> soon appeared not only in French and German but also
  in Norwegian. This is all the more remarkable because it had to be transported
  illegally and distributed to the principal cities -- Berlin, Leipzig, Bremen, and
  others. It is noteworthy that Liebknecht's group distributed Lenin's pamphlet.</p>

  <p>Thus it was very clear that the Bolsheviks had consolidated a revolutionary
  internationalist position which already had political influence that went beyond the
  small circle of the left Zimmerwaldians, reaching into the lower echelon of the social
  democratic organizations and, through them, the workers.</p>

  <p>Lenin's pamphlet espoused the position of defeatism, a clear-cut call to convert the
  imperialist war into a war against the bourgeoisie and thus drew a very sharp line
  between the two conflicting tendencies at the Zimmerwald conference. While it is true
  that in Europe at the time the word "Zimmerwald" itself was a synonym for opposition to
  the war, it was the emergence of the left-wing, of a clear and principled
  anti-imperialist stand, which made Zimmerwald a really historic development.</p>

  <p>The ideological and political struggle, which had originally been a struggle
  conducted by the Bolsheviks against the Mensheviks, now revealed itself to be an
  international struggle. Opportunism as a social phenomenon had become evident in the
  international socialist movement. The war had merely brought the whole struggle between
  the two tendencies in the international movement to the surface. It took on a different
  character in different countries, but what was common to them all was that the
  right-wing revealed itself as opportunist, while the left-wing, especially during and
  after the war, was for reviving and resuscitating revolutionary working class struggle
  and orthodox Marxism.</p>

  <p>Lenin's position on defeatism was further refined in the Zimmerwald article "The
  Defeat of One's Own Government in the Imperialist War." <a href="#fn3">[3]</a> <a name=
  "ret3" id="ret3"></a> He aptly summed up his formula for struggle against the war in
  this sentence: "The defeat of one's own capitalist government is the lesser evil in the
  struggle against the war." In this way Lenin was updating the formula proposed at the
  Stuttgart and Basel congresses that called for utilizing the difficulties created by
  the imperialist war to overthrow the capitalist class.</p>

  <p>"During a reactionary war a revolutionary class cannot but desire the defeat of its
  government," says Lenin. "This is axiomatic, and disputed only by conscious partisans
  or helpless satellites of the social-chauvinists. The opponents of the defeat slogan
  are simply afraid of themselves when they refuse to recognize the very obvious fact of
  the inseparable link between revolutionary agitation against the government and helping
  bring about its defeat."</p>

  <p>Further on, he says, "To repudiate the defeat slogan means allowing one's
  revolutionary ardor to degenerate into an empty phrase, or sheer hypocrisy."</p>

  <p>If the French, German, Russian, and Italian workers, as well as the Americans and
  Japanese, Lenin reckoned, had all in the course of this imperialist war devoted their
  energies to defeating the war effort of their respective capitalist countries, it would
  have been a collective act of international proletarian solidarity on the part of each
  of them. Those who were promoting the defeatist strategy of Lenin were in reality also
  promoting international solidarity as against the artificial divisions which the world
  imperialist bourgeoisie had created in the interest of imperialist superprofits.</p>

  <p>Other socialist organizations that said they were for stopping the war were for
  peace. But only the Bolsheviks, the Serbian and Bulgarian social democratic parties,
  Eugene V. Debs and the left-wing of the U.S. Socialist Party, and the Liebknecht
  grouping in the German SDP actively opposed the war. The others all said the
  continuation of the war was necessary in order to stop the aggression of the other
  imperialist powers. In this way French workers were ordered to kill German workers, and
  German workers were ordered to kill French workers, until aggression was stopped and
  imperialist peace achieved -- after the exhaustion of imperialist war.</p>

  <p>Thus, one of the fundamental and most significant differences between the Bolsheviks
  and nearly all other socialist organizations was not merely over how to stop the war.
  It was a different class approach.</p>

  <p>With the other socialists, the class struggle stopped with the outbreak of the war
  and national unity became the order of the day. The defense budget took preeminence
  just as it does today in all of the capitalist countries. Cuts in the living standard
  of the workers became necessary to overcome the crisis created by war expenditures. The
  workers would have to wait for an improvement after the war -- if they were still
  alive.</p>

  <p>With the Bolsheviks, the class struggle did not stop with the outbreak of war but
  took on a more intensified and vigorous form and had to be prosecuted to the end.</p>

  <p>When the first Russian revolution, which overthrew the czar, broke out in February
  1917,<a href="#fn4">[4]</a> <a name="ret4" id="ret4"></a> there was no thought among
  the Menshevik leaders of really stopping the war or overthrowing the rule of the
  bourgeoisie. But Lenin's way was to continue the class struggle so as to make sure the
  government would not participate on behalf of the bourgeoisie in the continuation of
  the war.</p>

  <p>On each and every question, no matter how small, the issue always revolved around
  the attitude to the bourgeoisie. How to win the peasants away from the landlords and
  enlist them on the side of the proletariat. How to win sections of the petty
  bourgeoisie. How to rally them all under the banner of the working class and separate
  them out from the bourgeoisie, while isolating the latter. All throughout the peaceful
  period preceding the war, during the war, and during the course of the whole
  revolution, a red thread runs through all of Leninist strategy and tactics. The
  struggle against war in peacetime as in wartime is a struggle against the bourgeoisie.
  It is inseparable from the struggle against capitalism. To defeat the efforts of the
  warmakers, it is necessary to defeat the ruling class, making no fundamental
  distinction between the ruling class at war and the ruling class during peacetime.</p>

  declared, nearly all the parliamentary representatives of the various Social Democratic
  parties cast their votes for war credits, allowing their respective bourgeois
  governments to allocate funds for the conflict. This destroyed the international
  solidarity of the working class in Europe and enabled the capitalists to pit worker
  against worker in the bloody struggle. The Russian Social Democratic deputies were
  among the few who voted against the war. <a href="#ret1">[return]</a></p>

  demonstrations in Moscow and Petrograd. In less than a week the soldiers' garrisons in
  those cities went over to the Revolution and Soviets of workers, soldiers, and peasants
  deputies were in command. The czarist regime crumbled and was replaced by the
  Provisional Government, which was dominated by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties.
  The new government remained in the war and conditions of the masses continued to
  worsen. In October 1917, the Provisional Government, by then under the leadership of
  A.F. Kerensky, was overthrown by the working class, led by the Bolshevik party, under
  the slogan "All Power to the Soviets." <a href="#ret4">[return]</a></p>
