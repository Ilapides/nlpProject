  Zimmerwald Manifesto</h1>

  <h3>Manifesto of the International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald</h3>

  <p>Proletarians of Europe!</p>

  <p>The war has lasted more than a year. Millions of corpses cover the battlefields.
  Millions of human beings have been crippled for the rest of their lives. <strong>Europe
  is like a gigantic human slaughterhouse.</strong> All civilization, created by the
  labor of many generations, is doomed to destruction. The most savage barbarism is today
  celebrating its triumph over all that hitherto constituted the pride of humanity.</p>

  <p>Irrespective of the truth as to the direct responsibility for the outbreak of the
  war, one thing is certain. <strong>The war which has produced this chaos is the outcome
  of imperialism,</strong> of the attempt on the part of the capitalist classes of each
  nation, to foster their greed for profit by the exploitation of human labor and of the
  natural treasures of the entire globe.</p>

  <p>Economically backward or politically weak nations are thereby subjugated by the
  Great Powers who, in this war, are seeking to remake the world map with blood and iron
  in accord with their exploiting interests. Thus entire nations and countries, like
  Belgium, Poland, the Balkan states, and Armenia are threatened with the fate of being
  torn asunder, annexed as a whole or in part as booty in the game of compensations.</p>

  <p>In the course of the war, its driving forces are revealed in all their vileness.
  Shred after shred falls the veil with which the meaning of this world catastrophe was
  hidden from the consciousness of the peoples. The capitalists of all countries who are
  coining the red gold of war-profits out of the blood shed by the people, assert that
  the war is for defense of the fatherland, for democracy, and the liberation of
  oppressed nations! They lie. <strong>In actual reality, they are burying the freedom of
  their own people together with the independence of the other nations in the places of
  devastation.</strong></p>

  <p>New fetters, new chains, new burdens are arising, and it is the proletariat of all
  countries, of the victorious as well as of the conquered countries, that will have to
  bear them. Improvement in welfare was proclaimed at the outbreak of the war -- want and
  privation, unemployment and high prices, undernourishment and epidemics are the actual
  results. <strong>The burdens of war will consume the best energies of the peoples for
  decades,</strong> endanger the achievements of social reform, and hinder every step
  forward. Cultural devastation, economic decline, political reaction these are the
  blessings of this horrible conflict of nations. Thus the war reveals the naked figure
  of modern capitalism which has become irreconcilable, not only with the interests of
  the laboring masses, not only with the requirements of historical development, but also
  with the elementary conditions of human intercourse.</p>

  <p><strong>The ruling powers of capitalist society who held the fate of the nations in
  their hands, the monarchic as well as the republican governments, the secret diplomacy,
  the mighty business organizations, the bourgeois parties, the capitalist press, the
  Church -- all these bear the full weight of responsibility for this war which arose out
  of the social order fostering them and protected by them, and which is being waged for
  their interests.</strong></p>

  <p>Workers!</p>

  <p>Exploited, disfranchised, scorned, they called you brothers and comrades at the
  outbreak of the war when you were to be led to the slaughter, to death. And now that
  militarism has crippled you, mutilated you, degraded and annihilated you, the rulers
  demand that you surrender your interests, your aims, your ideals -- in a word,
  <strong>servile subordination to civil peace.</strong> They rob you of the possibility
  of expressing your views, your feelings, your pains; they prohibit you from raising
  your demands and defending them. The press gagged, political rights and liberties trod
  upon -- this is the way the <strong>military dictatorship</strong> rules today with an
  iron hand.</p>

  <p>This situation which threatens the entire future of Europe and of humanity cannot
  and must not be confronted by us any longer without action. The Socialist proletariat
  has waged a struggle against militarism for decades. With growing concern, its
  representatives at their national and international congresses occupied themselves with
  the ever more menacing danger of war growing out of imperialism. At
  <strong>Stuttgart,</strong> at <strong>Copenhagen,</strong> at <strong>Basel,</strong>
  the international Socialist congresses have indicated the course which the proletariat
  must follow.</p>

  <p>Since the beginning of the war, Socialist parties and labor organizations of various
  countries that helped to determine this course have disregarded the obligations
  following from this. Their representatives have called upon the working class
  <strong>to give up the class struggle,</strong> the only possible and effective method
  of proletarian emancipation. They have granted credits to the ruling classes for waging
  the war; they have placed themselves at the disposal of the governments for the most
  diverse services; through their press and their messengers, they have tried to win the
  neutrals for the government policies of their countries; they have delivered up to
  their governments <strong>Socialist Ministers</strong> as hostages for the preservation
  of civil peace, and <strong>thereby they have assumed the responsibility before the
  working class, before its present and its future, for this war, for its aims and its
  methods.</strong> And just as the individual parties, so the highest of the appointed
  representative bodies of the Socialists of all countries, the <strong>International
  Socialist Bureau,</strong> has failed them.</p>

  <p>These facts are equally responsible for the fact that the international working
  class which did not succumb to the national panic of the first war period, or which
  freed itself from it, has still, in the second year of the slaughter of peoples, found
  no ways and means of taking up an energetic struggle for peace simultaneously in all
  countries.</p>

  <p>In this unbearable situation, we, the representatives of the Socialist parties,
  trade unions and their minorities, we Germans, French, Italians, Russians, Poles,
  Letts, Rumanians, Bulgarians, Swedes, Norwegians, Dutch, and Swiss, we who stand, not
  on the ground of national solidarity with the exploiting class, but on the ground of
  the international solidarity of the proletariat and of the class struggle, have
  assembled to retie the torn threads of international relations and to call upon the
  working class to recover itself and to fight for peace.</p>

  <p>This struggle is the struggle for freedom, for the <strong>reconciliation</strong>
  of peoples, for Socialism. It is necessary to take up this struggle for peace, for a
  peace without annexations or war indemnities. <strong>Such a peace, however, is only
  possible if every thought of violating the rights and liberties of nations is
  condemned.</strong> Neither the occupation of entire countries nor of separate parts of
  countries must lead to their violent annexation. No annexation, whether open or
  concealed, and no forcible economic attachment made still more unbearable by political
  disfranchisement. <strong>The right of self-determination of nations must be the
  indestructible principle in the system of national relationships of
  peoples.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Proletarians!</strong></p>

  <p>Since the outbreak of the war, you have placed your energy, your courage, your
  endurance at the service of the ruling classes. Now you must stand up for your own
  cause, for the sacred aims of Socialism, for the emancipation of the oppressed nations
  as well as of the enslaved classes, by means of the irreconcilable proletarian class
  struggle.</p>

  <p>It is the task and the duty of the Socialists of the belligerent countries to take
  up this struggle with full force; it is the task and the duty of the Socialists of the
  neutral states to support their brothers in this struggle against bloody barbarism with
  every effective means. Never in world history was there a more urgent, a more sublime
  task, the fulfillment of which should be our common labor. No sacrifice is too great,
  no burden too heavy in order to achieve this goal: peace among the peoples.</p>

  <p>Working men and working women! Mothers and fathers! Widows and orphans! Wounded and
  crippled! We call to all of you who are suffering from the war and because of the war:
  Beyond all borders, beyond the reeking battlefields, beyond the devastated cities and
  villages --</p>

  <p>Proletarians of all countries, unite!</p>
