  <h1><small>Appendix I</small><br />
  Resolution adopted at the Seventh International Socialist
  Congress at Stuttgart</h1>

  <p>The Congress confirms the resolutions adopted by previous international congresses
  against militarism and imperialism and declares once more that the struggle against
  militarism cannot be separated from the Socialist class struggle in general.</p>

  <p>Wars between capitalist states are, as a rule, the outcome of their competition on
  the world market, for each state seeks not only to secure its existing markets, but
  also to conquer new ones. In this, the subjugation of foreign peoples and countries
  plays a prominent role. These wars result furthermore from the incessant race for
  armaments by militarism, one of the chief instruments of bourgeois class rule and of
  the economic and political subjugation of the working class.</p>

  <p>Wars are favored by the national prejudices which are systematically cultivated
  among civilized peoples in the interest of the ruling classes for the purpose of
  distracting the proletarian masses from their own class tasks as well as from their
  duties of international solidarity.</p>

  <p>Wars, therefore, are part of the very nature of capitalism; they will cease only
  when the capitalist system is abolished or when the enormous sacrifices in men and
  money required by the advance in military technique and the indignation called forth by
  armaments, drive the peoples to abolish this system.</p>

  <p>For this reason, the proletariat, which contributes most of the soldiers and makes
  most of the material sacrifices is a natural opponent of war which contradicts its
  highest goal -- the creation of an economic order on a Socialist basis which will bring
  about the solidarity of all peoples.</p>

  <p>The Congress, therefore, considers it as the duty of the working class and
  particularly of its representatives in the parliaments to combat the naval and military
  armaments with all their might, characterizing the class nature of bourgeois society
  and the motive for the maintenance of national antagonisms, and to refuse the means for
  these armaments. It is their duty to work for the education of the working-class youth
  in the spirit of the brotherhood of nations and of Socialism while developing their
  class consciousness.</p>

  <p>The Congress sees in the democratic organization of the army, in the substitution of
  the militia for the standing army, an essential guarantee that offensive wars will be
  rendered impossible and the overcoming of national antagonisms facilitated.</p>

  <p>The International is not able to determine in rigid forms the anti-militarist
  actions of the working class which are naturally different in different countries and
  for different circumstances of time and place. But it is its duty to coordinate and
  increase to the utmost the efforts of the working class against war.</p>

  <p>In fact, since the International Congress at Brussels the proletariat has employed
  the most diverse forms of action with increasing emphasis and success in its
  indefatigable struggles against militarism by refusing the means for naval and military
  armaments and by its efforts to democratize the military organization -- all for the
  purpose of preventing the outbreak of wars or of putting a stop to them, as well as for
  utilizing the convulsions of society caused by war for the emancipation of the working
  class.</p>

  <p>This was evidenced especially by the agreement between the English and French trade
  unions following the Fashoda Affair for the maintenance of peace and for the
  restoration of friendly relations between England and France; by the procedure of the
  Social-Democratic parties in the German and French parliaments during the Morocco
  crisis; the demonstrations arranged by the French and German Socialists for the same
  purpose; the concerted action of the Socialists of Austria and Italy who met in Trieste
  in order to prevent a conflict between the two countries; furthermore, by the energetic
  intervention of the Socialist workers of Sweden in order to prevent an attack upon
  Norway; finally, the heroic, self-sacrificing struggle of the Socialist workers and
  peasants of Russia and Poland in order to oppose the war unleashed by czarism, to put a
  stop to it, and to utilize the crisis of the country for the liberation of the working
  class.</p>

  <p>All these efforts are evidence of the growing power of the proletariat and of its
  increasing ability to secure the maintenance of peace by resolute intervention. The
  action of the working class will be all the more successful the more that its spirit is
  prepared by a corresponding action and the labor parties of the various countries are
  spurred on and coordinated by the International.</p>

  <p>The Congress is convinced that, under the pressure of the proletariat, by a serious
  use of arbitration in place of the miserable measures of the governments, the benefit
  of disarmament can be secured to all nations, making it possible to employ the enormous
  expenditures of money and energy, which are swallowed up by military armaments and
  wars, for cultural purposes.</p>

  <p>If a war threatens to break out, it is the duty of the working classes and their
  parliamentary representatives in the countries involved, supported by the coordinating
  activity of the International Socialist Bureau, to exert every effort in order to
  prevent the outbreak of war by the means they consider most effective, which naturally
  vary according to the sharpening of the class struggle and the sharpening of the
  general political situation.</p>

  <p>In case war should break out anyway, it is their duty to intervene in favor of its
  speedy termination and with all their powers to utilize the economic and political
  crisis created by the war to rouse the masses and thereby to hasten the downfall of
  capitalist class rule.</p>
