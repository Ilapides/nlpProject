  Lenin's response to the war</h1>

  <p>The outbreak of the imperialist war in 1914 was, of course, a crushing blow to the
  entire working class. But the conduct of the official leadership of the Socialist
  International in its surrender to the bourgeoisie was almost indescribable.</p>

  <p>Such a betrayal as occurred in the period following August 1914 was unparalleled in
  the annals of the class struggle. It was the abandonment of a whole international class
  -- the workers of the world.</p>

  <p>How the outbreak of the war found Lenin is a frequent subject of historians who
  concern themselves with that particular period. We will not take up here in any detail
  the views of the outright reactionaries, who are mainly concerned with vilifying the
  revolution and distorting the historic significance of Lenin's role in it. Suffice it
  to mention only Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who despite his rabidly reactionary yearnings
  for the good old days of czarist autocracy, has been raised to heroic proportions by
  being awarded a Nobel literature prize for his falsification of Russian history,
  particularly the revolutionary period. Solzhenitsyn has done his worst to portray Lenin
  as being lost at the outbreak of the war wholly out of touch with the situation in
  czarist Russia, and even surprised at the outbreak of the February Revolution.</p>

  <p>Then there are the so-called friendly social critics of the left. They deal with the
  same period but do little to shed fight on the most delicate and sensitive area which
  the bourgeoisie in general is most interested in demolishing -- the relationship
  between building the party and the revolution. Isaac Deutscher is a leading
  representative of this type.</p>

  <p>"In previous years," writes Deutscher, "international Socialist congresses had
  addressed strong anti-militaristic appeals to the working classes of the world, but few
  of the leaders really believed in the imminence of war. In the two years before its
  outbreak Lenin, immersed in factional affairs, wrote scarcely anything which suggests
  his awareness of the danger. When the war did break out, he was taken aback by the
  behavior of European socialism.</p>

  <p>"On reading in Swiss newspapers that the parliamentarians of German socialism came
  out in support of the Kaiser's war, he refused to believe his eyes and at first treated
  the report as a kite flown by the German General Staff to fool the working class into
  acceptance. So great and simple had been his belief in the strength of Socialist
  internationalism. For a brief spell he was so downcast that he thought of leaving
  politics altogether. But then he recovered and decided to 'wage war on war.' He was no
  pacifist. His answer to war was revolution." <a href="#fn1">[1]</a> <a name="ret1" id=
  "ret1"></a></p>

  <p>It would have been impossible for any revolutionary Marxist who had spent a lifetime
  in stubborn struggle against the czarist autocracy and the bourgeoisie as a whole to
  view the downfall of the Second International with equanimity. That would be
  unrealistic.</p>

  <p>It is another matter entirely to paint Lenin as having been so downcast at the
  collapse of the International that he would think of leaving politics. Lenin scarcely
  needs any defense in the revolutionary working class movement today. But this version
  of Lenin needs to be corrected. Not only that, a whole number of misconceptions are
  here encapsulated into a single paragraph.</p>

  <p>First of all, the international congresses, by which Deutscher must have meant
  Stuttgart and Basel, did not merely address strong anti-militarist appeals to the
  workers. The resolutions of these congresses, which in many ways are a model for today,
  were directed at the overthrow of the capitalist system, and said precisely that.</p>

  <p>While they may have become nothing more than ceremonial and harmless resolutions to
  the majority of the officialdom -- that is, the central staff of the Second
  International where the German and French social democrats predominated -- these
  resolutions enabled Lenin and the Bolsheviks to continue the struggle and demonstrate
  the legitimacy of the leftwing. They immediately began to lay the basis for a new
  international that would be heir to the revolutionary traditions of the Second
  International and in particular to its anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist legacy and
  the legacy of revolutionary Marxism as a whole.</p>

  <p>As we pointed out earlier, Lenin was one of the collaborators in amending the Basel
  resolution, along with Rosa Luxemburg and Martov. There are many anti-war resolutions
  today that are strongly worded, anti-militarist and address themselves to the workers,
  but they are usually not related to the struggle against capitalism, nor do they
  admonish the workers to overthrow the system of capitalist exploitation in the event of
  war, as did the Stuttgart and Basel resolutions.</p>

  <p>The Basel and Stuttgart resolutions were by no means a dead letter with the
  Bolsheviks, even at the most difficult and critical moments when confusion reigned
  supreme all over the working class world and affected the revolutionaries as a
  whole.</p>

  <p>It is no accident that a bare few days after the outbreak of the war, one Bolshevik
  deputy in the czarist Duma (the so-called parliament) was accosted at his home one
  evening by a crowd of bourgeois journalists from all the St. Petersburg newspapers.
  They began to question him on the Bolshevik attitude toward the war. (Of course, the
  bourgeois press didn't print the Bolsheviks' statement. They were busy whipping up the
  chauvinist hysteria.)</p>

  <p>Here is what the Bolshevik deputy had to say:</p>

  <blockquote>
    The working class will oppose the war with all its force. The war is against the
    interests of the workers. On the contrary, its edge is turned against the working
    class all over the world. The Basel Congress of the Socialist International in the
    name of the world proletariat, passed a resolution declaring that, in case of the
    declaration of war, our duty was to wage a determined struggle against it.<br />
    <br />
    We, the real representatives of the working class, will fight for the slogan, 'War
    against war!' Every member of our fraction will fight against the war with all the
    means at his disposal. <a href="#fn2">[2]</a> <a name="ret2" id="ret2"></a></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>This demonstrates more than anything that the Bolsheviks by no means
  looked upon the Basel and Stuttgart resolutions as ceremonial. They stood stoutly on
  the ground of internationalism and were not afraid to quote a "foreign" organization as
  an authority. Such was the kind of international solidarity which characterized the
  Bolsheviks. There is all of Lenin in it.

  <p>Deutscher, in describing Lenin's shock on seeing a copy of the <em>Vorwarts</em>
  which carried the news of the German Social Democratic Party's support of the war
  presents a false picture of Lenin. His shock over the betrayal had nothing to do with
  Lenin's "great and simple belief" in socialist internationalism. Lenin's
  internationalism on the contrary was of the deepest and profoundest kind.</p>

  <p>He knew all the leaders of the Second International. He had amassed the richest
  experience of any of them in inner-party as well as inter-party struggles, in carrying
  out a relentless war against conciliators, liquidators, and ultraleftists. In fact,
  Lenin's factional experience, even at that time, would have made it quite impossible
  for him to view the proletarian internationalism. of the Second International in
  isolation from the opportunism in the International. He was well aware of the
  opportunism of the right wing. He knew Kautsky personally by then and did not exactly
  regard him as the embodiment of proletarian internationalism Ever since the Bolsheviks
  had become the majority grouping of the Russian Social Democratic Party, Kautsky had
  tried to act as conciliator between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. But it was already
  long out of bounds to conciliate the irreconcilable.</p>

  <p>It is of course true that Lenin's belief in the strength of socialist
  internationalism was great. But it is not true, as Deutscher says, that it was simple,
  which conveys the impression of naivete.</p>

  <p>That characterization might, with certain qualifications, be correct for Eugene
  Debs, for whom Lenin had great respect as a militant and revolutionary socialist and
  also as an internationalist. Debs ceaselessly agitated on the basis that there was only
  one war he would participate in, a war of the working class against the capitalist
  class. For his militant opposition to the imperialist war, he was tried, convicted and
  jailed. But Debs" internationalism was indeed simple. While he was supportive of all
  the struggles against capitalism and imperialism, he was aloof from the Second
  International and also attempted to stand above the factionalism in his own party. He
  was more of a revolutionary agitator during that period than an active participant in
  the struggle of political tendencies. He had a keen insight into the basic antagonism
  between the working class and the capitalist class, but he had not made a comprehensive
  study of Marxism.</p>

  <p>Lenin's entire career as a revolutionary Marxist shows that he was not merely
  supportive of the anti-imperialist struggle and of international solidarity measures
  taken by the Second International. Lenin was a leading figure in shaping the boldest
  and most revolutionary conceptions of internationalism, which he pushed in the various
  congresses of the Second International.</p>

  <p>Lenin was a leading activist on the highest level of the Second International, as
  anyone can easily see who has read his evaluation of the international socialist
  congress in Stuttgart, as well as his comments on the Basel congress. Reading these
  today, many decades after they were written, one can only be astonished at the very
  clear perception he had of the political currents in the international socialist
  movement. He not only analyzed the character of the rightwing and of the opportunists
  and revisionists, but he also showed an awareness of the centrism of Kautsky.
  Furthermore, it is well known that Lenin attempted to form a left bloc within the
  Second International in which he tried to fuse the most determined and revolutionary
  elements within it. He approached Rosa Luxemburg and Clara Zetkin for the purposes of
  forming such a caucus.</p>

  <p>Lenin showed as long ago as 1907, and earlier too, that he had a keen appreciation
  of the growing strength of the opportunist current as regarded the colonial question in
  the deliberations of the international congress.</p>

  <p>"The great importance of the International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart," said
  Lenin in his evaluation, "lies in the fact that it marked the final consolidation of
  the Second International and the transformation of international congresses into
  business-like meetings which exercise very considerable influence on the nature and
  direction of socialist activities throughout the world."<a href="#fn3">[3]</a> <a name=
  "ret3" id="ret3"></a></p>

  <p>In a slightly earlier commentary on Stuttgart, he had written, "Besides providing an
  impressive demonstration of international unity in the proletarian struggle, the
  Congress played an outstanding part in defining the tactics of the socialist party."
  <a href="#fn4">[4]</a> <a name="ret4" id="ret4"></a> The congress was "striking proof
  that socialism is being welded into a single international force."</p>

  <p>He then went on to analyze the existence of an opportunist current and explained how
  the congress defeated the Dutch delegates' opportunist formulation of the colonial
  question. He indicated that a very dangerous trend was being introduced, although it
  was defeated at the congress. <a href="#fn5">[5]</a> <a name="ret5" id="ret5"></a></p>

  <p>He also attacked Herve <a href="#fn6">[6]</a> <a name="ret6" id="ret6"></a> for
  taking a seemingly more militant but in reality semi-anarchist view in the struggle
  against the war. And, of course, he showed that it was his and Rosa Luxemburg's
  amendments to Bebel's <a href="#fn7">[7]</a> <a name="ret7" id="ret7"></a> resolution
  which put in the key paragraph, which called for utilizing the crisis created by the
  war to hasten the overthrow of the bourgeoisie. Kautsky is mentioned in this very
  illuminating article only once, Lenin characterized Kautsky's approach as correct but
  cautious.</p>

  <p>By the time another socialist congress was called the International Socialist Bureau
  and its constituent parties had all carried out huge demonstrations against the war
  build-up and had issued much agitation and propaganda material. By that time, Lenin's
  relations with the leaders of the Second International were pretty well formulated. The
  centrists leaned in the direction of being conciliatory to the Mensheviks. In fact
  Kautsky himself was showing increasing signs of leaning toward the Mensheviks. Efforts
  at conciliation between the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks showed all too clearly that they
  feared Lenin's "Blanquism" <a href="#fn8">[8]</a> <a name="ret8" id="ret8"></a> and
  "sectarianism." Although Lenin regarded Kautsky by the standards of that era as a
  leader of the Second International, he by no means had a naive attitude toward him or
  the others.</p>

  <p>His clear conception of the principal social trends in the Second International
  precluded any addiction to the kind of abstract or simple internationalism alluded to
  by Deutscher. He was only too well aware that socialist internationalism as an
  objective factor in the struggle of the worldwide working class was one thing. The
  question of leadership, which was one of his principal contributions in the struggle,
  was another matter. Being supportive of socialist internationalism, having strong
  convictions about it, all this of course was important and indispensable. But the
  struggle to make socialist internationalism more than an abstract, general guide was
  precisely where Leninism distinguished itself from the social democracy of the time.
  Lenin's internationalism was rooted in his acute perception of the class struggle and
  the bourgeois social tendencies which manifested themselves in left political groupings
  and had to be continually combated.</p>

  <p>Certainly the war did not come as a bolt from the blue. But the fact that none of
  the leaders, even among the most revolutionary in the Second International, were able
  to predict the betrayal demonstrated that opportunism as a social trend in the world
  movement had advanced like a disease far more rapidly and had engulfed and captured the
  leadership to a greater degree than any of the revolutionaries could have
  anticipated.</p>

  <p>Naivete in relationships, both in the party and in the International, was not a
  trait of Lenin's. Even Lenin's worst enemies knew he was above all a realist.</p>

  <p>He knew that the bourgeoisie was capable of any crime, any frame-up. It was more in
  keeping with previous historical experience to believe that the Kaiser would carry out
  a frame-up of the German party than that the Socialist International would utterly
  capitulate. It is in this context that one should see Lenin's reaction to the
  <em>Vorwarts</em> article -- in the context of such monstrous bourgeois frame-ups as
  the Dreyfus affair, <a href="#fn9">[9]</a> <a name="ret9" id="ret9"></a> the sinking of
  the Lusitania, <a href="#fn10">[10]</a> <a name="ret10" id="ret10"></a> and czarist
  attempts to frame the Jewish people with the so-called Protocols of Zion. <a href=
  "#fn11">[11]</a> <a name="ret11" id="ret11"></a> A modern example would be the Gulf of
  Tonkin hoax. <a href="#fn12">[12]</a> <a name="ret12" id="ret12"></a></p>

  <p>Finally, there is no documentary evidence whatever known to us which would justify
  the assertion that Lenin was so downcast he was thinking of leaving politics
  altogether. For one thing, he literally had no time to think about it. But one must
  examine a chronology of Lenin's political behavior in the period immediately after the
  declaration of war. When the war broke out, Lenin and Krupskaya <a href=
  "#fn13">[13]</a> <a name="ret13" id="ret13"></a> were in Krakow (now part of Poland),
  which at the time was under Austrian domination. At the outbreak of the war, Krakow was
  a beehive of activity for the Bolshevik exiles. Lenin was up to his ears with work in
  connection with the revolutionary resurgence in Russia, where the strike movement was
  taking on greater and greater momentum.</p>

  <p>No sooner had the war broken out than Lenin was arrested at the instigation of the
  czarist authorities. He was released after pressure on the Austrian government through
  social democratic friends and contacts. Within days of his release, Lenin began working
  feverishly on a thesis against the war.</p>

  <p>It is also putting Lenin totally out of focus in this period to say that in the two
  years before the war, he was immersed in factional affairs and wrote scarcely anything
  suggesting his awareness of the danger. Deutscher misses a point which should be
  obvious to him as a historian of the revolution and of the period in general. The
  factional struggle to which he refers, the intransigent struggle to build the Bolshevik
  party on a firm working-class basis, the struggle against the rightwing of the Social
  Democratic Party of Russia -- the Mensheviks, the liquidators, the conciliators to
  bourgeois ideology -- all of this was in essence also a struggle against imperialist
  war if it were to break out. But when it would break out, or if it would break out, was
  not an issue in the party or the international as a whole.</p>

  <p>During the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05 the Russian Social Democratic Party as a
  whole, including both the Menshevik and Bolshevik factions, had opposed the war. It
  should be noted that the Japanese social democrats, too, were opposed to the war. The
  party and the International also took a correct position on the war in the Balkans.</p>

  <p>Lenin wrote what was necessary for the prosecution of the revolutionary class
  struggle of the period. It was the building and consolidation of the party in that
  crucial period which was so indispensable to the success of the revolution.</p>

  <p>Lenin was a polemicist. He took up those arguments which needed to be answered. For
  instance, he had several years earlier written his celebrated <em>Materialism and
  Empirio-Criticism,</em> <a href="#fn14">[14]</a> <a name="ret14" id="ret14"></a> in
  which he vigorously defended the purity of Marxist methodology against the attempt to
  adulterate dialectical materialism with bourgeois idealism. Lenin did not write this
  very important defense of materialism against the neo-Kantians and disciples of Mach
  <a href="#fn15">[15]</a> <a name="ret15" id="ret15"></a> just because he had a general
  interest in defending philosophical materialism against the conciliators with
  agnosticism, a form of idealism. No, he did so because it had become an issue in the
  party. Lenin characterized the grouping in the Bolshevik party led by A. Bogdanov and
  A.V. Lunacharsky as god-seekers conciliating with religion, which had grown in the
  period of reaction. To reduce this theoretical work down to being immersed in factional
  affairs in Deutscher's words is totally inadequate.</p>

  <p>There could be no more cogent evidence of where Lenin stood at the outbreak of the
  war than what can only be described as an eyewitness account of him during the days and
  weeks immediately following the start of the onslaught. We refer to the "Recollections
  of G. L. Shklovsky" originally published in 1925. <a href="#fn16">[16]</a> <a name=
  "ret16" id="ret16"></a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"I may testify," says Shklovsky, "that the fundamental slogans of Lenin's tactic
    in the imperialist war had been formulated by him in Austria during the first few
    days of the war, for he brought them to Berne completely formulated.</p>

    <p>"And further! I have every reason for stating that this tactic had matured in
    Lenin's head probably on the first day of the war."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This gave Lenin precious little time for the kind of pessimism and dejection which
  Deutscher attributes to him.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"My arrest on the third or fourth day of the war may serve as a proof of this
    statement. ... My arrest was caused by a telegram from Vladimir Ilich [Lenin]
    addressed to me which was intercepted by the Swiss military authorities. In this
    telegram Lenin suggested that I should get in touch with our comrades in Paris for
    the purpose of organizing the issue of war leaflets and proclamations. This indicates
    that there was not a moment of doubt or vacillation on the part of Vladimir Ilich and
    that on the first day of the war he was already thinking of a war against war, i.e.,
    of turning the imperialist war into a civil war."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There is no reason whatever to cast any doubt on Shklovsky's recollections. He had
  no motive to excessively build up Lenin, either personal or political. Shklovsky was an
  old Bolshevik and remained one throughout his revolutionary career, during the period
  of building the party, during the revolution, and long afterwards. He had been arrested
  many times and exiled, escaped from exile, and went to Switzerland in 1912. He was a
  Bolshevik delegate to the Basel International Socialist Congress and attended the Berne
  Congress of Bolshevik organizations abroad.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"On about the second day [after Lenin's arrival in Berne] a meeting was held in
    the forest ... where Ilich spoke on the attitude toward the war this being the only
    possible subject of discussion for us at that time." And only a bare few days later,
    that is, "on September 6 or 7," says Shklovsky, "a more intimate meeting was held in
    my apartment; at this meeting Ilich presented his theses on the war. It is
    interesting to see who was at this meeting in addition to Lenin."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In addition to Ilich Zinoviev and Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya, the following
  comrades were present: Samoilovm, Safarov, and Lilina, and possible Inessa.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"At this meeting Ilich's theses met with no objection whatsoever and were accepted
    in full. In a few days Comrade N.F. Samoilov departed with these theses for Russia
    via Italy and the Balkans. Furthermore, I had handed several copies of these theses
    to a student, Shenkman, who was at that time in sympathy with us and was leaving for
    Russia on the same boat. ..."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Had all gone well, Lenin's anti-war resolution would have been in the hands of the
  Bolshevik party. However, it was learned that the theses had been intercepted and
  became, as Shklovsky says, the chief evidence of the czarist government against the
  Bolshevik Duma group. Nonetheless, members of the Central Committee of the Duma group
  did become acquainted with the theses, adopted them, and thereafter the ball really
  started rolling to link up the Leninist grouping outside of Russia with the party
  inside the country.</p>

  <p>Shklovsky then describes the trial of the Bolshevik deputies to the Duma.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"From Deputy Petrovsky's testimony at the trial of the Bolsheviks it was revealed
    that these theses were also adopted by seven of the largest concerns in Petrograd."
    This is an extremely significant symptom of how class-conscious the workers were in
    Petrograd, but also shows that organizational steps of real import were already in
    progress.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A note in Gankin and Fisher's book <em>The Bolsheviks and the World War</em>
  states,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"In Russia these theses were mimeographed and sent to various large party
    organizations. Apparently they were discussed and adopted by the workers of a number
    of factories in Petersburg during the second half of September 1914; they were sent
    to Kamenev, in October they were discussed in Moscow, according to police records.
    They were discovered also in Baku. ... Samoilov recalls that in the middle of
    September 1914, immediately on his return from abroad, he presented the point of view
    of the Bureau of the Central Committee Abroad at a meeting of party members in
    Ivanovo-Voznesensk." <a href="#fn17">[17]</a> <a name="ret17" id="ret17"></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Finally the theses were discussed at a conference of Bolshevik deputies and party
  members on November 17, 1914.</p>

  <p>The first concern of Lenin upon his arrival in Switzerland was to resume the
  publication of the central organ, <em>Sotsial-Demokrat.</em> "I had to dig up my entire
  library," continues Shklovsky, "in order to establish the fact that the last number of
  <em>Sotsial-Demokrat</em> which had appeared in Paris approximately a year before was
  No. 32. ... [A]fter a period of almost two months, No. 33 of <em>Sotsial-Demokrat</em>
  appeared, the first issue after a long interruption.</p>

  <p>". ... We were entirely cut off from Russia. Only in the middle of October did we
  succeed, through Comrade Aleksandr [Shliapnikov], who had come to Stockholm for that
  purpose, in establishing the first contact with Russia. Vladimir Ilich held on to that
  link with all his strength, fearing that it might break, especially since about
  November 20 news was received of the arrest of the Duma group and of the members of the
  Central Committee in Russia."</p>

  <p>It was then that Lenin decided to call a conference of the sections of the party
  abroad. It was difficult to do this in light of wartime conditions, even from neutral
  Switzerland.</p>

  <p>"Still," says Shklovsky, "we succeeded in calling this Conference, although it was
  not as well represented as we had wished it. Our Scandinavian sections were not
  represented at the Conference and not a single representative was present from our
  comrades in Germany and Austria. Nor was there a representative from the London
  section. ..."</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, a break was made. Lenin was steadily moving with determination. He
  "missed no occasion of getting in touch with those individual foreigners, who in some
  way or other protested against the war" and attempted to reach out in every way with
  his revolutionary internationalist position. He "paid special interest to the parties
  and groups which had taken a more or less internationalist position (the Italian and
  Swiss parties, the German Left tendency, the Left tendency among the youth
  organizations).</p>

  <p>"In his relations with them," Shklovsky affirms, Lenin "directed all the strength of
  his revolutionary passion and of his iron logic not so much against the open
  opportunists, the struggle against whom he considered to be relatively easy, but
  against the covert defensists, the 'Centrists,' with Kautsky at the head. He missed no
  occasion, by word of mouth, in the press, in private letters, at meetings and wherever
  possible, to expose and to brand them as the meanest and most dangerous traitors.
  ..."</p>

  <p>This is an altogether different Lenin than the ones presented by the rabid
  restorationist Solzhenitsyn or the leftist Deutscher. And it is a very different view
  of the period immediately following the outbreak of the war. It dispels the falsehood
  that the leaders were all paralyzed and merely waiting for the masses to revolt, or
  were downcast, full of pessimism, and intending to quit altogether, as Deutscher
  presents Lenin. Instead, the immediate period after the war began was particularly
  significant in the preparation for the revolution. It was a vital link in the struggle
  to develop and strengthen the party and to enable it to ultimately carry out its
  task.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois view of it as presented above eliminates this vital link between the
  necessity of organizational and political preparation and the intervention of the
  masses for the overthrow of the czarist monarchy. It eliminates the very difficult and
  very necessary task of organizing and spreading Lenin's message on converting the
  imperialist war into a civil war. The impression is left that the spontaneous
  revolutionary intervention of the masses alone accounted for the revolution; it
  downplays the vital element of preparing the cadres to direct the spontaneous
  revolutionary upheaval, not merely into anti-czarist but into anti-capitalist and
  anti-imperialist directions, paving the way for the proletarian revolution.</p>

  <p>It is no accident that bourgeois historians almost universally underplay the period
  of preparation, the long hard years in exile. They show their hostility to the future
  leaders of the revolution by portraying them as a variety of exile groups, each
  claiming hegemony over the masses with whom these exile leaders had no connection, and
  squabbling over abstruse theories to which the masses had no affinity.</p>

  <p>The possibility of a world war had been foreseen by Engels as far back as 1887.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>No war is any longer possible for Prussia-Germany except a world war and a world
    war indeed of an extension and violence hitherto undreamt of. Eight to ten millions
    of soldiers will mutually massacre one another and in doing so devour the whole of
    Europe until they have stripped it barer than any swarm of locusts has ever done. The
    devastation of the Thirty Years' War compressed into three or four years and spread
    over the whole Continent; famine, pestilence, general demoralization both of the
    armies and of the mass of the people produced by acute distress; hopeless confusion
    of our artificial machinery in trade, industry and credit, ending in general
    bankruptcy; collapse of the old states and their traditional state wisdom to such an
    extent that crowns will roll by dozens on the pavement and there will be nobody to
    pick them up, absolute impossibility of foreseeing how it will all end and who will
    come out of the struggle as victor; only one result absolutely certain: general
    exhaustion and the establishment of the conditions for the ultimate victory of the

  </blockquote>

  <p>This general prognosis of Engels was well known among the socialist leaders. The
  Russo-Japanese war and the Balkans war were responded to in a generally progressive
  manner by the parties in the Second International.</p>

  <p>Lenin would certainly have written more on the subject had there been divergent
  prognoses on the war, if differences had arisen on the approach. Had that been the
  case, and had he failed to join the polemic, criticism would be valid. In general Lenin
  was not given to speculation and writing on subjects of no immediate significance in
  preparing the workers for the struggle. His main work was to relentlessly and without
  letup propagate the irreconcilable struggle against the bourgeoisie, whose
  representatives in the working class movement were the Mensheviks, the conciliators
  with the bourgeoisie, and the liquidators. It was therefore no wonder that the
  Bolsheviks led the anti-war struggle and were exiled to Siberia for their role in
  it.</p>

  <p>The fact that Lenin in this period did not write on the impending imperialist war
  which would have been speculative in character in any case, should be seen against the
  background of his most urgent tasks in relation to the party.</p>

  <p>Frequently overlooked by Western historians of the period we are discussing are the
  immense, almost herculean tasks Lenin had in coordinating the legal and illegal work of
  the party, and supervising the very important but delicate work of the Bolshevik
  fraction in the Duma.</p>

  <p>One of Lenin's outstanding contributions to the proper pursuit of the class struggle
  against the bourgeoisie lies precisely in his unique approach to rigorously pursuing a
  revolutionary class line, without falling into the trap of surrendering to whatever
  semblance of bourgeois legality exists, or of giving up on the struggle altogether and
  awaiting the spontaneous rise of the masses. Much of Lenin's work went into elaborating
  and consistently pursuing the need for combining both tasks -- legal and illegal. What
  probably is least of all understood in the Western bourgeois democracies is Lenin's
  role in organizing, educating, and supervising the work of the Bolshevik fraction in
  the Duma.</p>

  <p>Take for instance the Social Democratic Party in Germany as it exists today, or for
  that matter as it has always existed. Even back in Kautsky's time, when he was the
  recognized theoretical leader of the party, the work of the Reichstag fraction was
  mostly done by the insiders themselves. It was a fraction that sort of led itself. Of
  course, there was general agreement with the central organ of the party, but by and
  large it was loose. Kautsky did not exercise the kind of political authority and
  organizational direction over the fraction that Lenin did in Russia, even when he was
  in exile. Today Willy Brandt, chairman of the German Social Democratic Party can
  exercise only whatever broad moral authority he may have over the party. By and large
  the party fraction in the Federal Republic of Germany today is run by the
  parliamentarians. Even party congresses are little more than advisory groups whose
  often radical resolutions are rarely taken seriously by the establishment "inside"
  groups who wield the power and authority. To the extent that the party as a whole
  exercises influence upon the fraction it is really of a marginal character. And this is
  the case in almost all the other workers' parties in the bourgeois democracies where
  parliamentary fractions exist.</p>

  <p>Lenin's task was most difficult in that the Bolshevik deputies were hunted and
  harassed by the czarist police, and often faced long years in prison. In order to wield
  political influence over them and infuse them with his revolutionary class approach,
  Lenin had to do more than just generalize the problems of the Duma fraction, which by
  then had become a strong force in the Russian labor movement. He also meticulously did
  their work for them.</p>

  <p>It was Lenin who in the early days, following the defeat of the 1905 Revolution,
  carefully studied the deliberately complex character of the czarist election procedures
  after the czar finally authorized elections to the Duma. Lenin unraveled many of these
  intricate election technicalities and showed how in even the most reactionary Duma it
  was possible to introduce important resolutions on the situation in Russia -- workers'
  conditions, the nationalities question, and many others. He frequently wrote their
  speeches. He particularly studied the agrarian question so as to enable the Bolshevik
  deputies to present an independent program in relation to the bourgeois parties, who
  vied with the Bolsheviks for the allegiance of the peasantry.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that in the 1912 elections to the Duma, the Bolsheviks carried
  all seats in the workers' districts, or so-called curias. Their fraction was known as
  the Bolshevik Six. The Menshevik Seven won their seats mostly in areas reflecting the
  petty bourgeoisie and intelligentsia. Krupskaya in her <em>Reminiscences of Lenin</em>
  <a href="#fn19">[19]</a> <a name="ret19" id="ret19"></a> says that the Bolshevik Six
  represented a million workers, whereas the seven Menshevik deputies represented less
  than a quarter of a million people.</p>

  <p>A point to be made in connection with the present era is that the social democrats
  everywhere regard themselves (and the bourgeoisie almost always is only too eager to
  agree) as being democratic, in contrast to the communists, and especially the
  Bolsheviks. Yet when the Bolshevik Six and the Menshevik Seven tried to work together
  as one fraction, the Mensheviks "democratically" decided that they alone could speak
  for the combined group, they alone could frame the questions to be asked in the Duma,
  and they alone could decide what petty privileges the deputies would get in the way of
  exercising whatever rights the Duma members had. One would think in light of the narrow
  margin won, let alone how many workers each represented, that elementary democratic
  rules dictated at least a more or less equal division of authority. But the Menshevik
  Seven stuck to their guns and even caused a scandal in the international. They forced
  Plekhanov, who was abroad then and was nominally the head of the Social Democratic
  Party as a whole, to resign because of this dispute. Of course, on the broader
  questions dividing the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks, Plekhanov stood with the former.</p>

  <p>By 1912 when the resurgence was in full swing and legality was restored in some
  measure because of the upsurge, the Bolsheviks were able to put out a daily paper --
  Pravda. It was no mean task for Lenin to write for it almost daily. Overall there were
  always urgent tasks organizing conferences of the party and continuing the struggle
  against the Mensheviks in all phases of the class struggle.</p>

  <p>All this work had the greatest significance in shaping the Bolshevik party to be
  able to withstand the tide of chauvinism that swept Europe at the outbreak of the
  war.</p>

  than 100 Americans. This event became a rallying cry for the pro-war faction, in the
  U.S. When the U.S. finally entered the war against Germany in 1917, it was under the
  slogan "Remember the Lusitania! " Germany claimed that the ship had been carrying
  contraband war material. It wasn't until 1960 that the U.S. and Britain opened secret
  archives showing that the ship's manifest made public after the tragedy had been a
  forgery and that the Lusitania was carrying 60 tons of shells and bullets when it was
  hit. The large loss of life had been due to the ship sinking in only ten minutes.

  ratified by the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, passed in the Senate on August 7, 1964, which
  in the absence of any declaration of war became the legal "justification" for the
  massive escalation by the U.S. government of the war in Viet Nam. It was finally
  revealed seven years later with the publication of the Pentagon Papers that the U.S.
  had been planning to bomb the North for six months and engineered the "attacks" as a
