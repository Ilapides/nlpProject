  <h1><small>Appendix VI</small><br />
  Draft resolution from leftwing at Zimmerwald</h1>

  <h3>Draft resolution of the leftwing delegates at the International Socialist
  Conference at Zimmerwald</h3>

  <p>The World War, which has been devastating Europe for the last year, is an
  <strong>imperialist war</strong> waged for the political and economic exploitation of
  the world, export markets, sources of raw material, spheres of capital investment, etc.
  It is a product of capitalist development which connects the entire world in a world
  economy, but at the same time permits the existence of national state capitalist groups
  with opposing interests.</p>

  <p>If the bourgeoisie and the governments seek to conceal this character of the World
  War by asserting that it is a question of a forced struggle for <strong>national
  independence,</strong> it is only to mislead the proletariat, since the war is being
  waged for the oppression of foreign peoples and countries. Equally untruthful are the
  legends concerning the defense of democracy in this war, since imperialism signifies
  the most unscrupulous domination of big capital and political reaction.</p>

  <p>Imperialism can only be overcome by overcoming the contradictions which produce it,
  that is, by the <strong>Socialist organization</strong> of the advanced capitalist
  countries for which the objective conditions are already ripe.</p>

  <p>At the outbreak of the war, the majority of the labor leaders had not raised this
  only possible slogan in opposition to imperialism. Prejudiced by nationalism, rotten
  with opportunism, at the <strong>beginning of the World War they betrayed the
  proletariat to imperialism and gave up the principles of Socialism and thereby the real
  struggle for the everyday interests of the proletariat.</strong></p>

  <p>Social-patriotism and social-imperialism, the standpoint of the openly patriotic
  majority of the formerly Social-Democratic leaders in Germany, as well as the
  opposition-mannered center of the party around Kautsky, and to which <strong>in France
  and Austria</strong> the majority, <strong>in England and Russia</strong> a part of the
  leaders (Hyndman, the Fabians, the Trade-Unionists, Plekhanov, Rubanovich, the
  <strong>Nasha Zarya</strong> group) confess, is a more dangerous enemy to the
  proletariat than the bourgeois apostles of imperialism, since, misusing the banner of
  Socialism, it can mislead the unenlightened workers. <strong>The ruthless struggle
  against social-imperialism constitutes the first condition for the revolutionary
  mobilization of the proletariat and the reconstruction of the
  International.</strong></p>

  <p>It is the task of the Socialist parties, as well as of the Socialist opposition in
  the now social-imperialist parties, to call and lead the laboring masses to the
  <strong>revolutionary struggle</strong> against the capitalist governments for the
  conquest of political power for the Socialist organization of society.</p>

  <p>Without giving up the struggle for every foot of ground within the framework of
  capitalism, for every reform strengthening the proletariat, without renouncing any
  means of organization and agitation, the revolutionary Social-Democrats, on the
  contrary, must utilize all the struggles, all the reforms demanded by our minimum
  program for the purpose of sharpening this war crisis as well as every social and
  political crisis of capitalism of extending them to an attack upon its very
  foundations. By waging this struggle <strong>under the slogan of Socialism</strong> it
  will render the laboring masses immune to the slogans of the oppression of one people
  by another as expressed in the maintenance of the domination of one nation over
  another, in the cry for new annexations; it will render them deaf to the temptations of
  national solidarity which has led the proletarians to the battlefields.</p>

  <p>The signal for this struggle is the struggle against the World War, for the speedy
  termination of the slaughter of nations. This struggle demands the refusal of war
  credits, quitting the cabinets, the denunciation of the capitalist, anti-Socialist
  character of the war from the tribunes of the parliaments, in the columns of the legal,
  and where necessary illegal, press, the sharpest struggle against social-patriotism,
  and the utilization of every movement of the people caused by the results of the war
  (misery, great losses etc.) for the organization of street demonstrations against the
  governments, propaganda of international solidarity in the trenches, the encouragement
  of economic strikes, the effort to transform them into political strikes under
  favorable conditions. Civil war, not civil peace -- that is the slogan!</p>

  <p>As against all illusions that it is possible to bring about the basis of a lasting
  peace, the beginning of disarmament, by any decisions of diplomats and the governments,
  the revolutionary Social-Democrats must repeatedly tell the masses of the people that
  only the social revolution can bring about a lasting peace and the emancipation of
  humanity.</p>
