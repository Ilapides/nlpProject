  <h1>Reindustrialization and the Capitalist Economic Crisis</h1>

  <p>For almost a year there has been an intense and heated discussion in leading circles
  of the ruling class regarding so-called reindustrialization. This discussion of
  economic and industrial policy grows out of three crises which have engulfed American
  finance capital.</p>

  <p>There is, first of all, the current, ever-deepening capitalist economic crisis which
  is causing more and more millions of people to become unemployed and is slowly bringing
  some industries to a virtual standstill.</p>

  <p>There is another crisis, one which has long preceded the current economic slowdown.
  This crisis, as we demonstrated earlier, grows out of the relative decline of U.S.
  industry in relation to the capitalist rivals of the U.S. in the world market. This
  crisis has been developing for longer than a decade.</p>

  <p>Finally, there is still a third crisis, which in military circles is referred to as
  the geopolitical crisis. By this is meant the declining military, political, and
  diplomatic position of the U.S. in world affairs.</p>

  <p>This crisis is a result of the loss by U.S. imperialism of its predominant role as
  the world's policeman. It is no longer the supreme military, diplomatic, and political
  leader of the "free world."</p>

  <p>Of course, the U.S. has more arms and appropriates more money for military
  expenditures than ever. It finds, however, that it can no longer, by virtue of its
  combined military and economic strength, maintain the supremacy it had at the end of
  the Second World War in world affairs.</p>

  <p>The ideologists of the ruling class are deeply concerned because these three
  apparently separate and independent crises are really intimately connected and flow
  from the same source &mdash; the general decay of the capitalist system.</p>

  <p><strong>Attempt to confuse different crises</strong></p>

  <p>In their effort to disguise the nature of the general economic crisis, these
  bourgeois ideologists are concentrating and attempting to get public attention focused
  mostly on the second crisis, the crisis facing the U.S. from stiff competition with its
  capitalist rivals. They identify and concentrate on this crisis in the hope of
  persuading and eventually forcing the broad masses of the United States to accept the
  ruling class's solution to the crisis.</p>

  <p>The solution to the problem, they say, lies in modernizing and retooling the basic
  industrial structure of the U.S. They summarize it all by the term
  "reindustrialization." Over and over again the cry from leading bourgeois economic
  journals as well as the media is "Our plants are obsolescent, we need to restructure
  them." As <em>Business Week</em> , the organ of big business and high finance put it in
  its special issue on. The reindustrialization of America June 30 1980 what is needed is
  to "change or die."</p>

  <p>The reader should note that the ideologists of the bourgeoisie deliberately try to
  confuse the crisis which U.S. manufacturers face in competition with their capitalist
  rivals abroad with the current economic crisis. The latter is first of all a crisis of
  <strong>capitalist overproduction.</strong> The ruling class usually calls it the
  cyclical crisis. While it is true that these crises of overproduction come in cycles,
  they are the principal cause of the mammoth unemployment.</p>

  <p>The capitalist cyclical crisis is a crisis of overabundance, not of scarcity. For
  instance, in spite of a drought in many areas of the U.S., especially the Southwest,
  corn, wheat, soybeans, beef, pork, and poultry are all in superabundance. The
  supermarkets are loaded with the most varied assortment of groceries. The granaries are
  overstocked.</p>

  <p>Even oil, previously alleged to have been in scarce supply, is now available
  everywhere. In fact, the world market is awash with a glut of oil. Automobiles,
  appliances, and literally thousands of manufactured items produced in the U.S. are now
  glutting the market. And there is an urgent need by the mass of the people for all that
  is being produced in the United States.</p>

  <p><strong>Superabundance despite obsolescence</strong></p>

  <p>The reason why all these commodities are not being sold is not due to any
  obsolescence of U.S. plants and equipment. On the contrary with the obsolescent plants
  U.S. industry has produced overall <strong>more</strong> than what the mass of the
  people can purchase.</p>

  <p>Why is this so? It is simply due to the fact that <strong>the capitalists produce
  goods and services only for profit and not for need.</strong></p>

  <p>Once the capitalist class finds that its commodities can no longer be sold at a
  profit, it cuts back production severely or stops it altogether. It is this phenomenon
  of capitalist overproduction which is based on producing for a blind market in search
  of profits only, which lies at the root of the basic crisis. It's not the obsolescence
  of the plants. The obsolescence is only remotely related, if at all, to the present
  economic crisis and is not part of it.</p>

  <p>U.S. Steel may not have modernized its plants as it should have. But there is the
  most crying and desperate need for all kinds of steel products for public housing. The
  steel industry can fill these orders quickly. But that's not what they want to produce
  unless there is a huge profit in it.</p>

  <p>This is true in each of the industries where there is what is called "excess
  capacity," meaning that part of the plant is idle. Steel and other goods are available.
  There is enough to satisfy demands based on human needs for all.</p>

  <p><strong>Modernization and unemployment</strong></p>

  <p>The obsolescence of the plants in the U.S. is a product of neglect by the ruling
  class. Their efforts to modernize them, as they hope to do, is to meet the competition
  of their capitalist rivals, even if modernizing has to mean millions upon millions of
  more unemployed.</p>

  <p>The ruling class tries to hide the cause of the crisis because it cannot be cured
  except on the basis of the abolition of the private ownership of the means of
  production and the reconstruction of society on a socialist basis.</p>

  <p>Their effort to confuse the capitalist cyclical crisis with their competitive crisis
  abroad leads them to focus completely on the retooling and modernizing of their entire
  industrial structure. They hope to do this by presenting such persuasive arguments as
  to lead the working class to accept their solution, which calls for the most
  devastating attack on the living standards of the masses and unprecedented
  unemployment.</p>

  <p>Focusing in on the plight of the obsolescence of plants and equipment in the
  industrial structure of the U.S. is one aim of this new ideological attack by the
  ruling class. The other aim, of course, is to reestablish U.S. military supremacy,
  which entails not only a further modernization of the military equipment of the U.S.,
  including its most sophisticated weapons systems. It also entails a massive diversion
  of capital from the civilian to the military sector.</p>

  <p><strong>Industrial neglect from wars abroad</strong></p>

  <p>The obsolescence of U.S. manufacturing and industrial equipment which is not
  confined just to steel auto or shipbuilding is due in large measure to the neglect by
  the industrial barons and manufacturing magnates in this country which began
  immediately after the Second World War.</p>

  <p>The neglect arises from the fact that during the entire period from 1945 to the
  present day, the U.S. ruling class precipitated two major wars conducted by American
  finance capital in Korea and Viet Nam and dozens of counter-revolutionary military and
  paramilitary clandestine operations which include the overthrow of governments in
  Chile, Guatemala, the Congo, Brazil, Argentina, and Indonesia, just to name a few.</p>

  <p>During this period, the U.S. became a virtual garrison state. Much of the research
  and development as well as capital investments were diverted into military-industrial
  channels. Thus, some of the most highly industrialized plants and equipment centers in
  the U.S., where rapid development is most essential, became dependent on cost-plus,
  fixed-fee contracts. This, in turn, rather than stimulate innovation, new inventions,
  and general inventiveness, only retarded them.</p>

  <p><strong>Stifles competition</strong></p>

  <p>There is usually no bidding in cost-plus, fixed-fee contracts between the government
  and a defense contractor. The cost is what the contractor estimates it to be. The fee
  for the services is the one that is agreed to by the government and the contractor.</p>

  <p>Competition for prime defense contracts usually takes place in closed door sessions.
  Contracts are shared out between a small group of the most powerful defense
  corporations, most of which are intimately allied with the big banks. There are laws
  that enable the government to renegotiate contracts when the costs become scandalous as
  they did with the C-5 transport plane. This, however, is the exception rather than the
  rule.</p>

  <p>The absence of real competitive bidding in these industries stifles what the ruling
  class generally boasts about most &mdash; competition. Moreover, it drains away
  so-called venture capital into the military-industrial field where the investments are
  secure and the returns are extortionate.</p>

  <p>The overall effect is not only inflationary to the economy but engenders a period of
  false capitalist prosperity such as existed during the entire Viet Nam era and beyond.
  Moreover, this phenomenon spills over into all the industries, notwithstanding that
  some are only remotely related to the military-industrial complex.</p>

  <p>In the wake of this false prosperity generated by cost-plus, fixed-fee contracts the
  vast industrial and equipment apparatus of the U.S. was neglected and decayed relative
  to the U.S. imperialist rivals abroad, such as Japan and West Germany, and became
  somewhat obsolete.</p>

  <p><strong>Perspective for crisis</strong></p>

  <p>As we said, American finance capital, faced with a triple crisis, must first of all
  concentrate on the crisis which they hope can best appeal to the workers in order to
  get them to accept the ruling class's solution, namely, the loss of the U.S.
  competitive position in the world market.</p>

  <p>It is necessary not to confuse the latter with the basic economic cyclical crisis.
  The reoccurrence of these cyclical crises again and again, ever since the first general
  crisis of 1825, is the underlying cause of the general crisis of capitalism.</p>

  <p>Equally important is to avoid confusing the geopolitical crisis with the other two.
  This crisis grows out of the very nature of the military-industrial complex, which is a
  product of monopoly capitalism and which relentlessly pushes in the direction of
  imperialist adventures and war in order to restore the old and bygone era of U.S.
  military supremacy.</p>

  <p>It is in this connection that the heated discussion in the ruling class concerning
  reindustrialization must be seen. It is important to note that both capitalist parties,
  the Republicans and the Democrats, are drafting or have already drafted planks in their
  programs which in one way or another call for the so-called reindustrialization of
  America.</p>

  <p><strong>Throwing millions out of work</strong></p>

  <p>Among those who are leading the discussion in the public press of the bourgeoisie is
  Peter Drucker, a professor at Claremont College and a management consultant and adviser
  to the huge corporations. He sums up his view on reindustrialization in the <em>Wall
  Street Journal.</em></p>

  <p>"The only way," he says, "for a developed economy [meaning, of course a capitalist
  economy like the U.S.] to regain its international competitiveness [in relation to its
  imperialist rivals] is to encourage a fairly rapid shrinkage of traditional blue collar
  employment."</p>

  <p>In other words, Drucker proposes a wholesale retooling of the industrial plants and
  equipment in such a way as to throw millions of workers out of work. The scale of
  industrialization about which he is talking is so vast that it would be comparable to
  the scale on which the farm labor force of the U.S. was decimated years ago.</p>

  <p>For instance, Drucker cites the fact that farmers made up 60% of the total U.S. work
  force in 1900, but account for only 3%-4% today. This "demographic change," as he calls
  it, is the type that must inevitably take place in the U.S., and quickly too.</p>

  <p>And what will happen to the millions of displaced workers? That is left up in the
  air to be dealt with presumably by government, industry, and labor!</p>

  <p><strong>The 'liberal' view</strong></p>

  <p>The more liberal proponents of reindustrialization, such as Felix Rohatyn, an
  investment banker from Lazard Freres and former head of the Municipal Assistance
  Corporation, advocate the setting up of a huge government corporation, such as the
  Reconstruction Finance Corporation set up by Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s. Rohatyn's
  idea is that the government would pour billions of dollars into this corporation, which
  would be used to assist obsolete and decaying industries and revive them.</p>

  <p>Rohatyn, in outlining his plan in a June 20, 1980 op-ed article in the
  <em>Washington Post</em>, says that this corporation is necessary because "private
  lenders [meaning the banks] are not able to cope with the needs of this magnitude." In
  other words, what the investment bankers for whom Rohatyn speaks really want is that
  the funds for this vast reindustrialization be first obtained from the government
  which, of course, will get it in turn from the workers, through either taxation or
  other means.</p>

  <p>Rohatyn fears that if the bankers and industrialists proceed on this hazardous
  course alone it would cause such million-fold unemployment that they would find
  themselves in a very dangerous position. The government would more easily be able to
  accomplish the same thing indirectly by financing it. In reality, it would all come out
  of the hides of the workers.</p>

  <p>Among those in the banking and industrial fraternity who share Rohatyn's views is
  Henry Kaufman of Solomon Brothers, another powerful investment banking combine from the
  so-called Eastern capitalist establishment. Included is Cyrus Vance who is also a
  spokesperson for the liberal element among the bankers and who is for stopping
  subsidies "merely" for the purpose of continuing obsolescent industries and for
  developing the modern high-technology industries. Vance proposes a "shift from obsolete
  industries, instead of propping them up with protectionist trade barriers." (Speech at
  Harvard University, June 5, 1980.)</p>

  <p><strong>Frank and brutal</strong></p>

  <p>Perhaps the best summary as to what the ruling class has in mind in respect to
  reindustrialization is stated by the so-called father of the idea in the first place.
  He is Amitai Etzioni, described in the <em>New York Times</em> as the senior adviser in
  the executive office of the President. He's a right-wing bourgeois sociologist and a
  former professor at Columbia University.</p>

  <p>Etzioni makes clear what the platform writers for the Republican and Democratic
  conventions and the horde of liberal economists try to dress up and conceal with
  alluring and exotic pictures of reindustrialization: Robots do all the work and somehow
  the mass of the workers laid off are lost in the shuffle in a barrage of utterly
  incredible semantic doubletalk.</p>

  <p>Etzioni states,</p>

  <p>"Decades of over-consumption [by the masses] and under-investment [by the
  capitalists] have weakened America's productive capacity Therefore in order to
  restructure American industry it is necessary to go through a decade [yes, a decade] of
  public and private belt-tightening if all the obsolescent elements are to be replaced
  and others adapted to the current environs." (<em>New York Times,</em> June 29,
  1980.)</p>

  <p>This is the most brutal and frank statement by someone with authority on what the
  reindustrialization will really mean &mdash; a decade of belt-tightening by the working
  class and oppressed people.</p>

  <p>It is plain that American finance capital is readying for a war against the bulk of
  the American people &mdash; the working class, the oppressed youth, women, lesbians,
  gay men, and the disabled. All are the object of the planned anti-labor offensive of
  big business.</p>

  <p>How can the working class meet the challenge posed by this ruling class
  offensive?</p>
