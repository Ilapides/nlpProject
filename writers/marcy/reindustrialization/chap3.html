  <h1>The Reemergence of the Inter-imperialist Struggle</h1>

  <p>There are certain fundamental trends inherent in the world system of the capitalist
  mode of production which cannot be overcome except on the basis of a revolutionary
  socialist reconstruction of society.</p>

  <p>In the absence of such a reconstruction these trends appear and reappear again and
  again. It should be noted that these fundamental trends, which were already visible
  during the early stage of capitalist commodity production, became an overriding and
  irresistible tendency at the turn of the last century with the transformation of the
  old competitive capitalist system into full-fledged monopoly capitalism.</p>

  <p>The most significant trend is the continuing struggle among the various huge
  capitalist cliques and combines, which are grouped into powerful multinational
  corporations, to grab ever-larger shares of the world market. It is the operation of
  these powerful combines and multinational conglomerates which has transformed the world
  market into a virtual combat zone for the most ferocious struggle between the largest
  capitalist states for the lion's share of the market.</p>

  <p>In this struggle, each of the leading imperialist countries inevitably tries to line
  up the smaller capitalist countries as well as the oppressed countries on their
  respective sides.</p>

  <p>While this struggle can be temporarily delayed, driven underground, or diverted, it
  nevertheless has reemerged again and again two frightful bloody imperialist wars
  notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>Thus, the struggle waged between capitalist Germany and Britain since the early
  1890s for industrial and economic hegemony has not disappeared What has happened is
  that Britain has become a junior partner of the U.S., and the axis of the economic
  struggle has shifted so that the struggle, so far as Europe is concerned and viewed in
  the light of economic hegemony is between capitalist Germany and the U.S.</p>

  <p>French imperialism is attempting to resume its pre-war position as a dominant
  political power on the Continent and seeks to exert its own sway against both West
  Germany and Britain, which is regarded as a semi-satellite of U.S. finance capital.</p>

  <p>The political aim of the U.S. in dropping the atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
  was not just a military victory. It was also aimed at threatening the USSR at a time
  when the Red Army had already liberated what was then known as Manchuria and was moving
  swiftly onward. It was also primarily aimed at reducing the industrial and economic
  power of Japan, to reduce it to a satellite of the U.S., to get it out of the way as
  the principal imperialist rival of the U.S. in the Far East.</p>

  <p>Thus it has been for the better part of a century that this small grouping of
  imperialist powers has struggled among themselves to dominate the world arena, each
  trying to vanquish the other in a virtual life-and-death contest. This struggle has
  arisen out of the very same original trends which set commodity capitalist production
  evolving into monopoly capitalism and bringing in its train the huge toll in
  destruction of both human and material resources.</p>

  <p><strong>Falsely presented as new phenomenon</strong></p>

  <p>What we see today in the extremely intensified character of the economic competition
  between the U.S. and its Japanese and West German rivals is an up-to-date version of
  what has characterized the entire preceding century of struggle among all the
  imperialist powers. It is the same old predatory struggle for capitalist markets in new
  conditions which means an intensification of the struggle against the working class in
  each of these countries, and more desperate attempts to fasten the yoke of neocolonial
  super-exploitation on the backs of the oppressed peoples. The efforts of the U.S.
  capitalist media to present it as a new phenomenon should be tirelessly and
  relentlessly unmasked. It should be explained to the millions of workers who will
  suffer the brunt of the economic competition between these rival trading powers.</p>

  <p>What muffles this ferocious and unrelenting struggle and drives them to contain it,
  at least temporarily, in more or less polite discussion of common problems is the
  existence of the USSR, its socialist allies, and the militant national liberation
  movements of the world. Without these, the imperialist struggle would have broken out
  in violent confrontation a long time ago.</p>

  <p><strong>Attempt to divert imperialist rivalry into anti-Soviet struggle</strong></p>

  <p>It is not to be wondered at, then, that the efforts of U.S. imperialism are more and
  more bent on redirecting the struggle to one against the USSR.</p>

  <p>Years of untiring efforts to contain the struggle on the basis of compromise and on
  the basis of live and let live, in the light of the existence of the USSR and other
  socialist countries, have proved fruitless. And only the attempt by U.S. imperialism to
  unify the imperialist rivals to achieve a semblance of a coalition and redirect the
  inter-imperialist struggle against the USSR remains as the last resort to contain
  irreconcilable imperialist contradictions.</p>

  <p>Consider this: more than a decade ago, the U.S. and other imperialist countries
  sponsored a worldwide trade conference known as the Kennedy Round, the purpose of which
  was to break down tariff walls and protectionist measures which hindered imperialist
  trade and commerce. This Kennedy Round of trade negotiations was followed by the
  so-called Tokyo Round, which was convened in Tokyo really under the sponsorship of the
  U.S. and led by the U.S. trade delegate Strauss. It was attended by 102 countries.</p>

  <p>Agreement was laboriously worked out to further liberalize trade, break down
  protectionist walls so as to facilitate trade and commerce "among the nations of the
  world," but in reality to facilitate the expansion of all the multi-national
  corporations and to prescribe certain limitations and abolish certain trade and
  commercial prohibitions which inhibited them all.</p>

  <p>In a word, it was an attempt at widening free trade and to revive the long-dormant
  spirit of Adam Smith. To no avail. Hardly had the ink on the documents dried when a
  capitalist crisis, which seemed at the time in 1978 as far away, began to make its way
  slowly and became evident in January 1979.</p>

  <p><strong>Protectionist demands rising</strong></p>

  <p>The Toyko Round seems to have been blown sky-high with the many holes that have been
  shot into it as a result of new protectionist demands made all over the capitalist
  world, and most loudly in the U.S.</p>

  <p>Just yesterday (June 30, 1980), to pick one instance out of many, the Ford Motor
  Company, through its president Philip Caldwell, told the <em>New York Times</em> that
  nothing less than a 15% quota on Japanese auto imports would suffice. It need hardly be
  said that Chrysler Corporation, which is still teetering on the verge of bankruptcy, is
  fully in agreement. The steel and textile industries and others are only too willing to
  applaud Ford's turnaround on the question of free trade. The reason General Motors
  hasn't joined the chorus has nothing to do with any attachment to such shibboleths as
  free trade or a stable world order. General Motors is not threatened as much by
  Japanese and West German inroads, and would sooner see Ford's and Chrysler's stature
  diminished in order to establish its more complete domination of the auto industry of
  the U.S.</p>

  <p>Such is the meaning of the cutthroat competition which the ruling class offers as an
  ideal for an orderly and rational economic system. The competition at home among the
  monopolies, especially during times of economic crisis, tends to become more and more
  directed outward. The attempt is made to transfer the contradictions that have brought
  about the new economic crisis into the world market at the expense of other capitalist
  countries and even more so the oppressed countries.</p>

  <p><strong>Economic crisis scuttles trade talks</strong></p>

  <p>This is not to say that West Germany, Japan, France, and Great Britain are not
  resorting to the same tactics. An orderly, equitable division, as they call it, of the
  imperialist booty cannot survive a severe capitalist crisis. This has been proven time
  and time again and the virtual scuttling of the Tokyo Round of trade negotiations is
  the latest proof of it.</p>

  <p>Nor can each of them restrain themselves from striving for hegemony and even
  monopoly over the others. Consider, for instance, what <em>Business Week</em> , the
  organ of U.S. big industry and high finance, says regarding a sector of U.S. industry
  which is of key significance:</p>

  <p>"Few industries have been exempt from the erosion of U.S. industrial power. Even
  sectors where the U.S. still racks up tremendous trade surpluses have been losing their
  share of the world market steadily. The aircraft industry exported nearly $10 billion
  worth of products last year while only $1 billion worth of planes and parts were
  imported." (<em>Business Week</em> , June <strong>30, 1980.)</strong></p>

  <p>The ratio in this exchange of aircraft, the reader will note, favors the U.S. 10 to
  1. How much more can one expect?</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, for this organ of aggressive finance capital, it is not enough.
  <strong>"U.S. domination is by no means as complete as it once was,"</strong> says
  <em>Business Week</em> . (Our emphasis.) Indeed, nothing less than complete economic
  domination is needed to ensure complete political domination.</p>

  <p>"America's 58% share of world airplane exports represented a significant decline
  from the 66% share of a decade ago." Further erosion, says <em>Business Week,</em> is
  almost inevitable as the European airbus attacks the U.S. monopoly of wide-bodied jets.
  The arrogance and belligerence of this approach can only be understood properly when
  one considers that 50%, 40%, or even 30% of the market in such a highly sophisticated
  and research-intensive industry, is considered a near monopoly.</p>

  <p><strong>European challenge to U.S. Aircraft monopoly</strong></p>

  <p>It should also be noted that <em>Business Week</em> is trying to scare the American
  public in general and to exhort the so-called captains of the U.S. military-industrial
  complex to exert themselves more in view of the alleged danger that is posed by the
  European airbus. The airbus it should also be noted is a European attempt to present
  somewhat of a challenge to the U.S. virtual monopoly of the aircraft and aerospace
  industry.</p>

  <p>The airbus is the product of a French, German, British, Spanish, and Dutch effort to
  give some competition to the U.S. in a field of technological competence in which the
  Europeans by no means consider themselves second-best. Nevertheless, despite the near
  monopoly of the U.S., which holds them down by political, diplomatic, and military
  means arising out of the results of the Second World War and the defeat of German
  imperialism, it is mostly a West German effort.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it should be noted that capitalist Germany's aerospace industry only
  has about 50,000 employees, France 100,000, and Britain 200,000, while the U.S. has a
  million. (Figures from <em>Barrons,</em> June 30 and <em>Wall Street Journal,</em> June
  24, 1980.) In the last chapter we showed that the Japanese aerospace industry has only
  35,000.</p>

  <p>It should be added however that U.S. multi-national aerospace corporations are so
  intimately linked with the Japanese aerospace industry that it pretty well assures the
  U.S. that any great leap forward, which poses a danger to the U.S., can be monitored
  quickly and in all probability squelched.</p>

  <p><strong>U.S. penetration of West German aerospace industry</strong></p>

  <p>So far as the European aerospace industry goes, the most important fact to remember
  vis-&amp;agrave;-vis U.S. industries moaning about the relative decline of their share
  of the market, is that United Technologies Corporation holds a hefty 26% of the stock
  in the leading West German combine of the European aerospace industry that is building
  the airbus.</p>

  <p>Of equal significance in relation to the U.S. military-industrial complex is that
  General Alexander Haig is the chairman of United Technologies Corporation. According to
  <em>Barrons,</em> the West German economics minister, Otto Graf Landsdorf, made a visit
  last February to his old friend, General Haig, in Brussels while he was Supreme
  Commander of NATO. "We have the impression," said the economics minister after the
  meeting was over, "that General Haig understands the problems and goals of our
  aerospace industry."</p>

  <p>What this means, given General Haig's militarist approach and hostility to the USSR,
  is that he will seek to orient the West German aerospace industry in an anti-Soviet
  military direction This however is easier said than done although the West German
  ruling class is virulently anti-communist and anti-Soviet. This is because they
  nevertheless would like more elbow room for their own imperialist ventures and would
  rather not be in a stranglehold dictated by General Haig and his colleagues in the
  military-industrial complex.</p>

  <p><strong>Behind Schmidt's visit to moscow</strong></p>

  <p>If we are to understand the near panic which gripped Washington when Chancellor
  Helmut Schmidt decided that he would make a trip to meet with Soviet leader Leonid
  Brezhnev, we must understand that it is not any conciliatory attitude by Schmidt and
  the West German ruling class he represents.</p>

  <p><strong>Instead we must look to the underlying economic causes which have been the
  fundamental basis for conflict among the imperialists.</strong> These are what
  motivated Schmidt to openly defy President Carter and thereby demonstrate that West
  German imperialism has its own predatory imperialist interests to look out for. These
  he deems may be perhaps better served by continuing badly needed trade and commerce
  with the Soviet Union, especially natural gas and if possible oil, than by merely
  acting as a puppet of the U.S.</p>

  <p>This, however, does not at all signify that the inter-imperialist conflicts have
  superseded the worldwide struggle between imperialism as a whole, notwithstanding its
  divisions and glaring contradictions, and the USSR, its socialist allies, and the
  national liberation movements. The struggle between these two antagonistic social
  systems based on two diametrically opposed social classes is still predominant.</p>

  <p>It is a continuing ongoing struggle in which each step forward made by the workers
  and oppressed of the world undermines the foundations of imperialist rule and paves the
  way for its demise.</p>
