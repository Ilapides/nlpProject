  <hr />

  <h1>The Tasks of the Working Class</h1>

  <p>In its effort to overcome the three-pronged character of the crisis which is rocking
  the capitalist system in the U.S., the ruling class is gearing up to place the entire
  burden of solving its crisis on the backs of the working class and the oppressed
  masses. This has posed the most acute problems for the official leadership of the U.S.
  trade union movement. Never have they been confronted with the magnitude of the
  problems with which they are faced today. In some respects, the contemporary problems
  greatly transcend those which arose from the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p>

  <p><strong>Labor leaders confronted with three crises</strong></p>

  <p>For the first time the labor bureaucracy has to deal with three crises
  simultaneously. It first of all has to deal with the current, cyclical, economic crisis
  which daily adds hundreds of thousands to the unemployment rolls and puts into jeopardy
  millions of others who are holding on precariously to their jobs as the crisis deepens.
  In other times, the labor leaders always tended to sit out the crisis and wait for the
  capitalist cycle of development, which brought on the crisis, to exhaust itself and
  thereby "solve" the crisis for the labor leadership.</p>

  <p>In recent years, however, each capitalist crisis, even when it is overcome leaves
  more workers unemployed than the previous one. Even the capitalist economists who
  predict a short duration for the present economic crisis, say it will leave many more
  millions unemployed than the previous crisis.</p>

  <p>In previous times, the labor leaders could content themselves by putting up a pro
  forma series of demands which were not seriously meant to be effective or fought for.
  Now, however, the growing restlessness and urgency of the situation makes this
  well-nigh impossible for them. One of the hidden reasons for their new concern lies in
  the fact that ever-greater numbers of skilled workers, the backbone of the old trade
  union bureaucracy, are becoming more and more endangered from layoffs arising from
  technological changes forced upon the workers.</p>

  <p><strong>Loss of U.S. competitive position</strong></p>

  <p>There is still another crisis. This crisis grows out of the loss of the predominant
  economic position of the U.S. in the world. This has meant the loss for U.S. capitalist
  commerce and trade of the competitive advantages it used to enjoy in the world
  capitalist market.</p>

  <p>What this has meant in terms of the loss of jobs in this country is hard to
  estimate, but it runs into the many hundreds of thousands, and some say as many as two
  million jobs will be lost by the end of 1983.</p>

  <p>Finally, there is yet a third crisis. It is called the geopolitical crisis. By this
  is meant the loss of the U.S. position as the world's military policeman.</p>

  <p>Up until now, the labor bureaucracy was the most vociferous in its demands for huge
  military expenditures, going even far beyond the so-called moderate bourgeois elements
  in the capitalist establishment. The labor bureaucracy paid only lip service to the
  social and economic demands of the workers whenever they were arrayed against military
  expenditures.</p>

  <p><strong>Military expenditures won't soak up unemployment</strong></p>

  <p>Now, however, it has become plain, even to the dullest in the labor hierarchy that
  in a period when the ruling class is relentlessly pushing for retrenchment and
  austerity military expenditures will not bring the same benefits to the workers in the
  defense plants as was the case during the heyday of the Second World War or the Korean
  and Viet Nam wars.</p>

  <p>For instance, the much-touted "vast employment program" of the military-industrial
  complex is now seen as greatly exaggerated. That's because the industrial tycoons
  bankers and military leaders are pushing more and more to replace blue collar workers
  with a minimum of white jacket technicians.</p>

  <p>An index of how things are really working out can be seen in such key
  military-industrial firms as McDonnell-Douglas, Boeing, and others. Although there has
  been an increase in the workforce there since the promulgation of the infamous "Carter
  [War] Doctrine," hiring has nowhere reached the level it was played up to be in early
  January. Far from it.</p>

  <p>In each of the huge military-industrial complex units, such as McDonnell-Douglas,
  Boeing, Martin-Marietta, and others, the contradiction between the civilian sector of
  the corporation, which produces, for instance, commercial planes, and military
  production is deep.</p>

  <p>In the most cherished units of the capitalist, industrial machine, the deepening
  economic crisis shows itself in the civilian sector which means the bona fide sale of
  commercial planes, etc., as opposed to the guaranteed purchase by the government of
  military hardware. McDonnell-Douglas didn't even show a profit in this last quarter,
  although it's plain that its misfortune with the DC-10 was the main factor.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless the broader aspect is the need by the industrialists including the
  military sector to shrink and reduce the work force. This is in marked contrast to what
  it was years ago when the retooling and gearing up of war industries was considered
  easy and employment even grew to excessive numbers because of a war economy.</p>

  <p>Today it is different. The whole economy is shrinking and deliberately made so by
  the bourgeoisie. The reverberating effects throughout the economy which defense orders
  are supposed to have are coming slow and are nothing like they have been during periods
  prior to a war.</p>

  <p>It is true, of course, that increased hiring in most of the defense plants is
  somewhat of a shelter for workers there. But here again even in the best of situations
  the ravages of capitalist inflation take their toll and overall cast a gloomy
  perspective This is especially so in the light of the fact that each new weapons system
  endangers the jobs not only of the unskilled, but of the highly skilled workers, who
  become an endangered species as a result of technological development.</p>

  <p><strong>Military is anti-labor</strong></p>

  <p>In previous periods, the labor bureaucracy could easily and falsely view the
  military as a sort of impartial arbitrator between labor and capital. It is becoming
  increasingly clear, however, that the military entertains a hostile attitude toward the
  trade unions, stands in utter disregard of the needs of the trade union movement, and
  is destructive of its legitimate ends. The Department of Defense &mdash; the DOD, as it
  is called-plays an enormous and hidden role in the so-called reindustrialization plans
  of the ruling class. It has for years been a guide and adviser to big industry as well
  as commerce.</p>

  <p><strong>The military aims at dispersing the concentrated character of the U.S. labor
  force under the guise of "national security."</strong> It seeks to break up huge plants
  into smaller units and relocate them in remote areas, supposedly for military security
  but in reality to shield new plants in particular from the progressive character of
  urban areas and union organization.</p>

  <p>The military favors high technology regardless of its cost in terms of the
  displacement of workers. It cherishes sophisticated and sometimes ridiculously
  fantastic weapons systems which have no use whatever, except in genocidal wars, and
  which require a preponderance of white jacket technicians as against blue collar
  workers.</p>

  <p>It's to be noted that the military not only discourages unionization of the armed
  forces but was recently instrumental in getting a law passed to prohibit collective
  bargaining of civilian employees in the army.</p>

  <p>The military brass is anti-labor. Rank-and-file soldiers, on the other hand, must be
  sought out as a supportive arm in the working-class struggle.</p>

  <p><strong>Crisis in perspective for labor bureaucracy</strong></p>

  <p>The triple character of the present crisis presents the labor bureaucracy with the
  deepest crisis of perspective that it has ever faced. The strategy of the ruling trade
  union leaders is totally out of accord with the new, multi-national character of the
  working class and the vast political problems the workers face growing insecurity plant
  closings shrinkage of industries and still-rising inflation, notwithstanding the drop
  in interest rates.</p>

  <p>Above all the bureaucracy resists the influence in the workplace of the growing
  numbers of Black, Latin, Asian, and Native workers, young and old, women and men, gay
  and straight.</p>

  <p><strong>Retooling to mean massive unemployment</strong></p>

  <p>The ruling class is going to push, one way or another, its huge retooling programs
  in industry such as auto, steel, shipbuilding, mining, and other related basic
  industries. In one way or another they aim to get the workers to pay for this in huge
  capital outlays which may run into the hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>

  <p>Whatever scheme they ultimately adopt or whatever combination of schemes they will
  finally compromise on, the cost of the so-called reindustrialization program means the
  introduction on a vaster more complex and truly more monstrous scale, of labor-saving
  devices which will reduce the massive U.S. labor force by millions. It entails a sharp
  escalation of plant closings, the relocation of plants as well as industries, and the
  dispersal of the concentrated character of the working class in huge plants, which has
  been the mainstay of working-class solidarity.</p>

  <p>All these plans of the ruling class tend to undermine the solidarity of the workers.
  They also undermine whatever efforts are commenced at organizing drives among the
  unorganized and tend to erode the fighting spirit of the organized trade union
  movement.</p>

  <p>Even now, there has been a steady and consistent erosion of trade union organizing
  drives, which the big business press has by no means lost sight of. The <em>Wall Street
  Journal</em> of July 28, 1980 states, "The latest National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
  statistics show that in the 12 months ending last September 30, unions won just 45% of
  the 8,000 representation elections held, the smallest percentage since the NLRB was
  created 45 years ago."</p>

  <p>The trade union bureaucracy does not have a program to meet any of the three crises
  and is merely coasting along, hanging on to the coattails this time reluctantly of the
  Carter administration It is totally lacking in any independent working-class
  program.</p>

  <p><strong>U.S. can't close door to imports</strong></p>

  <p>In previous decades the labor bureaucracy was in the vanguard of unloosing
  chauvinist attacks on imports as a way of doing yeoman service for the industrialists.
  Today, however, the U.S. ruling class is so deeply involved all over the globe as a
  result of military and diplomatic commitments that it cannot afford to close the doors
  to imports from its imperialist rivals. It needs their support in a reactionary
  struggle against the socialist countries.</p>

  <p>It cannot even close the doors to imports from its satellites such as Taiwan,
  Singapore, south Korea, not to speak of the puppet regimes that the U.S. controls south
  of its border whose vast natural resources it needs and which it has to protect against
  the revolutionary opposition of the masses.</p>

  <p>All of this points up that the strategy of the labor bureaucracy to the extent that
  they have one is totally out of accord with the real situation that is confronting the
  American working class. Even were it to try to seriously fight for what it considers to
  be its program of simple trade unionism &mdash; higher wages, encouraging the
  government to fight inflation, and fighting for a labor reform bill to put some teeth
  in the NLRB &mdash; it would be inadequate.</p>

  <p>Whatever its merits might have been decades ago, so far as the needs of the working
  class as a whole are concerned &mdash; Black, Latin, Asian, Native, and white, men and
  women, young and old, gay and straight, disabled and able-bodied &mdash; the strategy
  is like trying to fit a saddle on a cow.</p>

  <p><strong>Mass struggles to come</strong></p>

  <p>The triple crisis of American capitalism is bound to lead, as it did in the past, to
  volcano-like, mass, spontaneous eruptions akin to those of the 1930s. The character of
  the crisis, which will fall on the backs of the workers, is bound to make itself felt
  in mass outbursts, no matter how long and by what means the ruling class delays
  them.</p>

  <p>Just as the struggle of the thirties broke through and to a large extent away from
  the official trade union bureaucracy at the time, this is bound to repeat itself, only
  with far greater force. The Black and Latin struggles in recent years gained most of
  the concessions that were won by going beyond the traditional framework of Black and
  Latin leadership at the time.</p>

  <p>In order to meet the coming assaults of big business and the variety of
  reindustrialization plans of the ruling class, some of which are utterly fantastic and
  impractical and will only operate to provoke a resurgence of the militant mass struggle
  in the final analysis, it is necessary to construct a revolutionary strategy.</p>

  <p>It is often said that a revolutionary strategy is impossible in a period of
  regression or in reactionary times. But this overlooks the indispensable element of
  preparation and the inevitability of a mass upsurge in the light of the material
  foundations which lay the groundwork for it.</p>

  <p><strong>Workers' control</strong></p>

  <p>It is necessary once again to look into the nature and possibility of workers
  control of industry as an answer to the developing capitalist offensive.</p>

  <p>It is said that workers control of industry is utopian in present-day conditions and
  that in any case the workers and the unemployed do not see it as an answer to their
  problems. On the contrary, it is the strategy of the labor bureaucracy and the
  bourgeois liberals whom they support which is a reactionary utopia and does not answer
  the needs of the workers.</p>

  <p>It is true that workers' control has been a slogan for a long time as a transitional
  slogan toward a socialist revolution. The long period, which was ushered in by the
  Second World War and the capitalist stabilization and false prosperity that followed as
  a result of the Viet Nam and Korean wars, pushed the slogan into the background.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the demand for workers' control of industry as a transition to the
  socialist revolution cannot always and everywhere be easily adapted to working-class
  needs unless it is adequately prepared and preceded by a series of concrete preliminary
  demands which are fully in accord and thoroughly in harmony with the needs of the
  workers.</p>

  <h4>1. Prenotification plans &mdash; a preliminary to workers' control</h4>

  <p>One of the most pressing problems at the present time arising from the three-pronged
  character of the capitalist crisis is the virtual barrage of plant closings, especially
  of small ones. Also to be considered is the growing number of bankruptcies, especially
  among small establishments. How does workers control begin to have any significance in
  this area?</p>

  <p>Had the labor bureaucracy had some vision of the future of capitalist development
  and its endemic crises, it would have had its eyes open to plant closings as long ago
  as the late 1950s when there was only a small scattering of plant closings in the midst
  of capitalist economic stability.</p>

  <p>We had raised the problem then and proposed local, state, and federal laws that
  would require a year's notice, followed by hearings conducted by the workers and
  community groups before management dare close a plant. The proposal was first made in
  the Buffalo area where the Ford Motor Company closed its first plant and where Wickwire
  Steel also closed a plant. The labor bureaucracy on the whole paid no attention. The
  local union leadership listened with deep interest, but were unable to impress the
  national leaderships of their respective unions.</p>

  <p>Only now, almost two decades later and in the wake of a virtual epidemic of plant
  closings and bankruptcies, are there a significant number of bills in several states
  and one in Congress calling for such prenotification plans before any plant
  closing.</p>

  <p>A prenotification plan is one of the simplest and most elementary legislative
  measures to push for on a local, statewide, or national level. Had the labor
  bureaucracy pushed for a national prenotification law in Congress during the 1960s or
  even the early 1970s, it would have been far easier to garner support for it than it is
  now when big business has its hordes of lobbyists well aware of the significance of
  prenotification plans.</p>

  <p>Yet what is a prenotification plan &mdash; which practically every worker would be
  favorably disposed to &mdash; than an indispensable element in the preparation for
  workers' control of industry? A prenotification plan acts like an injunction against
  the bosses without the necessity of going to an individual court against an individual
  employer and going through lengthy court hearings in order to obtain the necessary
  relief.</p>

  <p><strong>Opens doors to decision making</strong></p>

  <p>Prenotification plans are a means to open to the workers the doors to the bosses'
  decision-making process and to make it possible to stop the bosses in their tracks. It
  lays the basis for rallying not only the thousands of communities which are intimately
  connected with the workers but others who lean in a progressive direction to form
  progressive coalitions to wrest from management that is from the ruling class the
  decision making power which has been reserved wholly for the industrial barons who run
  the mighty multi-national conglomerates.</p>

  <p>Right now merely starting a national campaign for the passage of a prenotification
  law in Congress before it adjourns or when the next one starts shortly thereafter could
  operate to mobilize the workers in this most crucial area of the class struggle.</p>

  <h4>2.Prenotification plans regarding mergers, consolidations, spinoffs, and
  bankruptcies</h4>

  <p>The idea of the workers having a right to official notice in sufficient time, such
  as is the case in a prenotification plan, may be new in the labor movement. It is not
  new, however, insofar as the struggle among the competing groups and combines of
  capitalists in this country. On the contrary prenotification plans, so far as the inner
  struggle among the large corporations goes, are more or less an integral part of their
  business.</p>

  <p>The present capitalist crisis was preceded by a wild orgy of takeovers by large
  corporations of smaller ones, of big fish swallowing smaller ones. It was also preceded
  by amalgamations between large corporations into conglomerates and by some of these
  huge conglomerates spinning off, that is, selling some of their units or divisions
  either for tax evasion purposes or other reasons. All of this usually results in
  cutting costs, which in the final analysis always means unit labor costs, followed by
  layoffs.</p>

  <p>The tremendous merger wave, which took place before the capitalist cyclical crisis
  broke out, carries with it tremendous costs to the livelihood of the workers. These
  mergers always entail rationalization or modernization through labor-saving devices or
  other means.</p>

  <p>The ruling class press and especially the business periodicals are full of stories
  of how, as a result of consolidations, top executives lose their jobs &mdash; heads
  roll &mdash; and middle management gets squeezed out. But who speaks for the workers?
  When Exxon attempts, as is currently rumored, to take over IBM, this may mean more
  dividends for the huge stockholders. But what will happen to the workers?</p>

  <p>Today, July 28 1980 the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company announced that it is
  acquiring &mdash; that is, swallowing up &mdash; the huge real estate holdings of Pan
  American World Airways in New York City, worth about $400 million. Metropolitan Life
  has more than $46 billion in assets. Naturally, when such a huge big business octopus
  takes over such a lucrative unit of another giant corporation, other sections of the
  ruling class are vitally concerned.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the capitalist government has made it a law that prenotification of any
  plans to acquire or take over or spin off must be given to the currency controller of
  the U.S., the Federal Reserve, the superintendent of Banking and Insurance, the
  Anti-Trust Division, and other departments of the capitalist government which look
  after some of the interests of other elements of the ruling class.</p>

  <p>But no notice of any type is required to be given to a labor organization, to the
  communities involved, or to the workers in general, although it vitally, deeply, and
  profoundly concerns them most of all.</p>

  <p>The end result of most of these mergers, consolidations, and spinoffs especially at
  the present time is huge layoffs especially among the lowest-paid category of workers
  which thereby shrinks the labor force.</p>

  <p><strong>Example of railroads</strong></p>

  <p>It is to be recalled that when the railroads in the U.S. were consolidated into the
  few that presently exist, it was all done without any consultation of the general
  public or the labor movement. Only specific individual unions pursuant to contracts had
  any say in the matter at all. It's no wonder that this has resulted in shrinking the
  labor force on the railroads to a mere one-third of what it was 20 years ago.</p>

  <p>If instead of the bosses just notifying the Interstate Commerce Commission and a few
  of the unions, pursuant to their contracts, there was a requirement of prenotification
  to labor and the communities of at least a year and then hearings would be scheduled to
  take place, giving sufficient time to mobilize the masses, a great deal could have been
  accomplished.</p>

  <p><strong>When businesses go bankrupt</strong></p>

  <p>There is still a vast field of industry which is comprised of hundreds of thousands
  of small plants and establishments of all sorts which face disaster, especially as the
  crisis becomes more severe.</p>

  <p>This shows itself up in the statistics as casualties in the form of 8,000,000
  bankruptcies a year. It causes casualties among the workers in the many hundreds of
  thousands, if not millions, who go unnoticed but who swell the unemployment, food stamp
  and welfare rolls. No attention is paid to this aspect of the decline except when a
  mammoth corporation collapses.</p>

  <p>What usually happens when these thousands of businesses, which employ hundreds of
  thousands if not millions of workers, collapse is that a bankruptcy court takes
  jurisdiction and divides the assets or reorganizes the business apportioning so much to
  each of the creditors.</p>

  <p>The worker's interests, except for the last week's pay, get no attention whatever.
  Workers' pensions are gravely endangered, if not entirely wiped out. A federal court
  appoints a referee, usually a well-to-do business lawyer, to wind up the affairs of
  these establishments or reorganize them. The large corporations of course become
  reorganized or consolidated, always resulting in the shrinkage of the labor force.</p>

  <p>Why should a court have any jurisdiction in the first place without having the
  workers' representative there as though it were a strike situation. Isn't this what
  happens during a lockout and doesn't a lockout have the very same effect? In reality a
  bankruptcy proceeding is just as much a struggle between labor and capital as
  negotiations for a union contract. Whether the company stays in business or not does
  not matter.</p>

  <p>All the more is it necessary for the workers' representative to be included in any
  bankruptcy proceeding in the same capacity as the boss's representative as though the
  business was a going concern. In any division of the assets, the workers' interests as
  a result of the loss of jobs should come first among the creditors in all respects, not
  last as is the case now.</p>

  <h4>3. Labor's veto right</h4>

  <p>Ordinary collective bargaining cannot answer the problems that are made inevitable
  by a whole series of technological revolutions which have an industry-wide character
  but also take in their tow closely related industries. Take, for instance, auto. What
  happens in auto affects one out of every six or seven workers in the United States.
  What happens in auto has a domino effect in steel glass rubber textile and other
  industries.</p>

  <p>Whoever takes a narrow or fragmented view of dealing with only one plant, no matter
  how big, ultimately finds that in this period of industrial capitalist decline they are
  utterly helpless. Take, for instance, what happened in Chrysler.</p>

  <p>For years the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) dealt with each of the big auto
  companies on an individual basis, believing that dividing the three competing giants
  was the best strategy. Assuming that dividing the auto giants had some limited value,
  it was at the expense of general working-class solidarity which became a crying need
  when Chrysler announced that it was near bankruptcy and needed the aid of the
  capitalist government.</p>

  <p><strong>Ignored transition to state capitalism</strong></p>

  <p>The UAW failed to see that the U.S. auto industry was undergoing a transition long
  since passed in other industries, especially in Europe, toward state capitalism.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the protagonists in this struggle were no longer the Chrysler workers
  versus the Chrysler Corporation. The subtle transition which took place transformed the
  arena of the struggle from that of the Chrysler workers against a single corporate
  giant into a struggle between the Chrysler workers and the entire capitalist state. The
  negotiations in truth were no longer between the UAW and Chrysler but between the UAW
  and the capitalist government as a whole.</p>

  <p>The Carter administration tried to mask the situation with the help of Chrysler
  management by reducing the role of the UAW in the bailout proceedings which in reality
  were bankruptcy proceedings. Instead of there being a struggle between all the
  autoworkers against the capitalist government the capitalist government reduced the UAW
  to one of several parties in the bailout along with Chrysler suppliers, dealers, state
  and county governments, and the banks. All were viewed to have some interest in the
  bailout negotiations along with labor which also had "some interest" with the
  others.</p>

  <p>But this merely masked the reality of the situation, which is a struggle between the
  auto workers, the real producers, against the bosses, the capitalists. Bankers,
  suppliers, dealers, state, municipal, or county governments, etc., are so many
  different arms of the ruling class.</p>

  <p>The UAW was drawn into accepting a position on the Chrysler board as one of several
  parties long before the negotiations began for the bailout. The true position in the
  given situation, which is going to be repeated in many industries as the capitalist
  crisis continues, is that the workers, that is, labor, are not just one of several
  interested parties along with the varied assortment of separate capitalist cliques.</p>

  <p><strong>Only two parties &mdash; labor and capital</strong></p>

  <p>In such a situation, the preliminary position of the workers' representatives has to
  be that there are, in reality, only two parties in the struggle of which labor is one.
  All the other different groupings are on the other side, in the camp of capital.</p>

  <p>Whether labor sits on the Chrysler board or not, it must have a veto power as
  against capital. To permit labor, that is, the working class, to be represented as one
  of many interested parties means that capital has the exclusive, predominant weight as
  against the working class by camouflaging the many separate interests of the
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Now that class collaboration has advanced so far in the trade union movement that
  capitalist government officials and the bosses as well are pushing for the so-called
  partnership between labor government commerce industry etc., it is more necessary than
  ever to find some legal way to clarify the class struggle, of projecting the
  irreconcilable class character of the struggle between capital and labor, between the
  exploiter and the exploited, so as to make it more understandable, at least in a
  preliminary way, among the broad masses of the workers.</p>

  <p>Thus if a union representative accepts a position on the board of directors of a
  large corporation and the union is obliged to support it as a result of unfavorable
  conditions, it would then be most important to propose that he or she accept the post
  with the right to veto any plans or projects whatsoever and not merely be counted as
  one of the board members or one of the several interests in the corporation since there
  are only two interests &mdash; that of the workers and that of the bosses.</p>

  <p>Up until now, it has been management, the bosses, that have exercised a veto power
  over everything the workers need and want to do except that which the bosses are forced
  to surrender in their contracts. But the bosses have shown they cannot run their own
  plants and are looking for ways to shut them down or curtail operations, leaving vast
  areas of industry idle. Especially at a time when they are trying to entice the labor
  leaders and others into their so-called partnership to retool and modernize at the
  workers' expense, labor and its allies, whether on the board of directors or otherwise,
  must perfect and popularize its right to veto and not allow management to simply
  consult and then do what it wants to.</p>

  <p>The veto power would then become another stepping stone in the direction of
  introducing workers' control of industry.</p>

  <h4>4. The right to a job as a property right</h4>

  <p>There can be no workers' control of industry without the workers having a job. This
  is the most indispensable element in the entire struggle. The right to a job must not
  be viewed solely as a political right, vital as it is.</p>

  <p>In a country which is so heavily steeped in bourgeois legality it is important to
  put as many workers' demands as is possible in the framework of the bourgeois legal
  system. This lesson is easily learned in days of genuine mass struggle.</p>

  <p>The right to a job as a property right is not an invention drawn out of thin air,
  divorced from the class struggle. On the contrary, jobs as a property right surfaced,
  even though momentarily, during the fiercest struggle of the sitdown strikes of the
  '30s, especially during the great General Motors sitdown.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois press howled that the sitdown strikers were violating private property
  by occupying the premises of the giant industrial corporation. The answer of some of
  the more developed workers was that their right to a job was also a property right and
  should be regarded as equally important by the capitalist government.</p>

  <p>It was not much later that even the then-Secretary of Labor Perkins said that she
  saw some validity to the idea that workers had a property right to their jobs. Indeed,
  it was an enforced recognition of what should be regarded as a commonplace and an
  elementary proposition in the struggle between the camp of the working class and the
  bourgeoisie. The latter own the means of production. These, however, are useless
  without the workers. The property rights of the workers derive from this inseparable
  relationship.</p>

  <p>True workers' control of industry cannot begin without this right becoming central
  to the whole struggle.</p>

  <h4>5. Enlarge workers' voting rights</h4>

  <p>Along with prenotification plans for plant closings, which will be in the offing as
  the retooling of industry progresses, there must also be a vast popularization campaign
  to enlarge the voting rights of the people in a somewhat new and different way than the
  mere biannual or quadrennial elections where the bosses pick their candidates and the
  people have to choose from them.</p>

  <p>How should the voting rights be enlarged? By allowing the people to vote directly,
  on an advisory basis first, on industry takeovers, especially where industries are
  failing but also where they are gouging the public.</p>

  <p>If given a chance, the majority of the people would vote for a people's takeover of
  the oil industry. Even a mere advisory vote, such as, for instance, is being attempted
  in the Detroit area, can give a powerful impetus to a takeover movement by the
  people.</p>

  <p>Wherever possible, propaganda should be directed to loosen the restrictive laws
  which surround the right to a referendum by the people. This is especially important in
  areas where large plants, which are the lifeblood of a community, are on the verge of
  collapse or relocation, or where attempts are being made to shrink the labor force in
  such a way as to make ghost towns out of vital industrial cities.</p>

  <p>If a Proposition 13 <a href="#fn1">[1]</a> <a name="ret1" id="ret1"></a> bill can be
  effectuated because it favored the rich, why not a proposition which puts the oil
  companies into the hands of the people? This can be done locally, on a statewide level,
  and must be vigorously pushed on a national level.</p>

  <p>Enlarging the rights of the people to vote <strong>when they think it is
  necessary,</strong> and not when they are dictated to, will introduce a wholly new
  perspective in the struggle of the workers for control of industry. This struggle is
  bound to escalate as the decline of capitalist production becomes more pronounced
  particularly in industries which have the greatest amount of obsolescence.</p>

  <p><strong>Wresting the authority from the ruling class</strong></p>

  <p>Workers' control, therefore, must be seen, first and foremost, as a series of
  concrete, preliminary steps of a varied character, depending on conditions before it
  can become an understandable and acceptable agitational slogan geared toward promoting
  the takeover of industry and putting it firmly under the control of the workers and
  their allies among the population.</p>

  <p>It goes without saying that no preliminary step can be of much significance unless
  it is accompanied simultaneously by an attempt to break loose from the captivity of the
  capitalist parties who by and large dominate both the thinking and the politics of the
  trade union officialdom Devising ever-more concrete simpler urgently needed steps in
  the direction of wresting the authority from the ruling class over the means of
  production is a historical necessity for the working class and especially the most
  oppressed and super-exploited masses.</p>

  <p>No policy, however progressive and revolutionary sounding it may be, can possibly
  succeed unless it becomes welded in a united front with the millions of undocumented
  workers and takes cognizance as well of the need to purge the movement of all racism
  and chauvinism. The U.S. labor force today is of a thoroughgoing multi-national
  character and both tactics and strategy must be fashioned to this all-important
  development.</p>

  <p>National oppression and the privileged character of the white, upper-stratum of the
  workers are an axis on which the ruling class has thrived long enough. It must be
  broken in order to weld working-class solidarity, which is so urgently needed in the
  struggle against capitalist exploitation and imperialist oppression.</p>
