  <h1>Economic Contraction and Military Expansion</h1>

  <p>At a time of deepening economic crisis, many of the bourgeois ideologists and
  particularly their economists have increasingly turned their research to analyzing the
  nature and profound implications of the great economic crisis which began with the
  stock market crisis of 1929.</p>

  <p>A recurring thought which continues to haunt many in the ruling class is the
  possibility that, notwithstanding current predictions, there may yet occur an economic
  catastrophe of the dimensions of the 1929 debacle.</p>

  <p>One of those professors who concerns himself with the 1929 economic crisis is
  Charles P. Kindleberger. In his book, <em>The World in Depression, 1929-1939,</em> he
  presents the thesis that "the world depression of 1929 was so widespread, so deep, and
  so prolonged, not because of the deep disturbances to the monetary system but because
  the monetary system itself was basically unstable" and therefore broke down.</p>

  <p>According to Kindleberger, when the economic leadership of Britain had eroded after
  the First World War and the U.S. failed to take it over, the monetary system collapsed
  of its own weight.</p>

  <p><strong>Monetary instability not the cause of collapse</strong></p>

  <p>Kindleberger's thesis is not a new approach. Many bourgeois economists have dealt
  extensively with the monetary crisis of the early 1930s and in one way or another they
  attribute the crisis either to mismanagement or accidental factors.</p>

  <p>It was not, of course, the instability or imperfections of the capitalist monetary
  system that were the cause of the great economic collapse. The cause of the crisis, as
  it has been ever since the first worldwide capitalist crisis of 1825, was capitalist
  overproduction. The recurring monetary crises, which have become so pervasive in the
  imperialist epoch, are the effect of capitalist overproduction, not the cause.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Kindleberger does point up a very important aspect of the world
  capitalist economy during that entire period which has relevance today, particularly as
  it affects the U.S. It is clear from his book, although he does not precisely say so,
  that it was not just the economic leadership of Britain that had become eroded. The
  significant fact that emerges from the entire era of the 1930s was that Britain
  notwithstanding its victorious position after World War 1, had lost considerable ground
  in the economic basis for its military, diplomatic, and political leadership on a world
  scale.</p>

  <p><strong>Economic base eroded</strong></p>

  <p>The British empire as it stood during the economic crisis &mdash; militarily
  diplomatically and politically &mdash; no longer had the formidable economic base to
  sustain its world imperialist leadership The financial and economic cost of maintaining
  such leadership was far out of proportion with the returns required for a thriving
  imperialist exploiter.</p>

  <p>Already in the 1920s, the British financial and industrial aristocracy was faced
  with the looming prospect of the loss of "our India," as the U.S. later was forced to
  face the prospect of losing "our China." The financial and economic responsibilities
  that British imperialism had toward the battered capitalist states of Europe, as well
  as its far-flung empire, put increasing strains on its obsolescent coal and metal
  industries, as well as its transport industry, including even the shipping industry.
  Britain did not "surrender" its economic leadership to the U.S., as Kindleberger
  maintains. The U.S. conquered British markets by economic warfare, particularly in
  Latin America and parts of Asia. All of this was told at the time in an illuminating
  book with the expressive title <em>America Conquers Britain</em> by Ludwell Denny.</p>

  <p>Britain lost its world leadership because it could not economically compete with the
  U.S., notwithstanding that its navy was second to none and that its worldwide empire
  was still juridically and militarily under its control. The worldwide revolutionary
  upsurge of the national liberation struggles, already fully in view in China, India,
  and Indonesia, made it clear that military expansion by the British imperialists while
  its economic base was narrowing both at home and abroad created an impossible situation
  for Britain. An explosion, a collapse, was inevitable.</p>

  <p><strong>Fallback position</strong></p>

  <p>There was, however, a silver lining in this darker picture for British finance
  capital and for the imperialists as a whole. <strong>There was a fallback position for
  Britain that prevented the kind of explosion that could have only ended in a
  revolutionary conflagration and turned Britain into a genuine socialist
  republic.</strong></p>

  <p>While American finance capital took over much of the markets of Britain and
  generally strengthened its position in relation to all of Western Europe and Japan, at
  the same time it secured the continued existence of Britain as a formidable imperialist
  power. In addition it became the guarantor of the vital interests of Britain as against
  other imperialist rivals such as Germany, as well as Japan, and a general bulwark of
  world political reaction.</p>

  <p>Thus the acute contradiction arising from the profound divergence between Britain's
  shrinking economic base and its ever-growing financial, diplomatic, and military
  commitments, found a fallback position in the none too gentle embrace of U.S. finance
  capital with its great military potential.</p>

  <p>But how is it with the U.S. today?</p>

  <p>There are some striking similarities between the British position of the 1930s and
  the U.S. position today. Like Britain only more, so the U.S. is in the grip of a
  profound geopolitical contradiction, one that becomes clearer with each passing
  day.</p>

  <p><strong>Basic contradiction</strong></p>

  <p>On the one hand the U.S. is in the midst of a steadily expanding military buildup of
  unprecedented and virtually unimaginable proportions. On the other hand the economic
  basis for sustaining such an unbridled military posture has been slowly but surely
  eroding.</p>

  <p>The current economic crisis will surely accelerate and continue the erosion. The
  malady however goes much deeper than the current crisis, nor did it spring into
  existence with the pronouncement of the Carter Doctrine.</p>

  <p>Unlike Britain in the 1930s <strong>the U.S. has no fallback position,</strong> a
  fact which both the political and economic planners at the summits of the capitalist
  establishment cannot but be deeply aware.</p>

  <p>A few years after the Second World War, the U.S. was the economic and military
  leader of world imperialism. It was the unquestioned dominant power in world affairs
  and it had attained virtually supreme political and military hegemony over the
  bourgeois world and the dependent, underdeveloped countries and oppressed peoples in
  the orbit of the world imperialist system.</p>

  <p>At that time, in the early 1950s, the U.S. was responsible for more than 50% of the
  world's gross production. At the beginning of the 1960s, the U.S. share of the world's
  gross production had diminished somewhere in the neighborhood of 35%. Today, according
  to the best estimates, it is between 25 and 27%.</p>

  <p><strong>Weakens geopolitical position</strong></p>

  <p>Were the gross national product of the U.S. produced for human use and not for
  profit, it would be more than sufficient to satisfy the great needs of the population
  of the U.S. and then some. But production for purposes of capitalist profit, which
  entails competition for capitalist markets and sources of raw materials, poses an
  entirely different set of circumstances and inevitably brings into play the
  geopolitical position of the U.S. From that point of view the relative position of the
  U.S. as a world power becomes tremendously weakened. It means, for instance, that in
  the event of any serious military struggle, the adversary, whether it be the
  imperialist rivals or the socialist countries, may have access to a portion of
  three-quarters of the world's total production.</p>

  <p>Just as significantly, the U.S.'s relative share of the world's gross product will
  continue to decline as the productive forces in the rest of the world must inevitably
  continue to expand relative to the U.S. position. In a world socialist cooperative
  commonwealth, on the other hand, the share of U.S. production, even though it be on a
  relatively diminishing scale, would be of tremendous importance because of the U.S.'s
  highly sophisticated technology and its capacity for mass production.</p>

  <p><strong>Beginning of general decline</strong></p>

  <p>The Second World War enabled the U.S. to exercise its economic political and
  military hegemony over the bourgeois world. From the end of the Second World War until
  the final defeat of the U.S. during the Viet Nam war, the U.S. capitalist economy was
  experiencing a general economic upsurge notwithstanding several capitalist recessions
  which were of generally short duration.</p>

  <p>A significant aspect of the economic cycles was that each peak of the economic cycle
  was lower than the preceding ones &mdash; a symptom of the beginning of general decline
  and erosion of the U.S. economic base. The U.S. military buildup began around 1946 when
  the military-industrial complex was fully validated by government decree in the form of
  a memorandum from Dwight D. Eisenhower in April, 1946 when he was Chief of Staff of the
  U.S. Army. (See <em>Generals Over the White House</em> by Sam Marcy, World View
  Publishers.)</p>

  <p>The military buildup that was in full swing in the 1950s and continued without any
  pause in tempo until the end of the Viet Nam war occurred therefore during a period of
  <strong>general economic upsurge</strong> notwithstanding several significant
  recessions. The buildup also occurred while U.S. imperialism retained most of its
  markets under its military umbrella. How markedly different is the situation today!</p>

  <p>The military buildup continues <strong>after</strong> the U.S. has lost its dominant
  position in Asia and has been severely restricted and under heavy pressure in all of
  Latin America. Its position in Europe has become politically and economically weakened,
  and in the Middle East it is most vulnerable to revolutionary attack from the oppressed
  people. Thus while military expansion continues the U.S. economic base continues to
  deteriorate and contract.</p>

  <p>The sources for the extraction of surplus value on a world scale have been narrowed
  and encumbered by revolutionary pressure of a most intense character from the oppressed
  peoples and underdeveloped countries.</p>

  <p>Finally, like Britain, the basic industries of the U.S. are in decline, in a state
  of decadence, and under fierce competitive attack by the very allies which the U.S.
  government did so much to cultivate and resuscitate following the Second World War.
  Even the most superficial observers of the state of the U.S. world position cannot but
  be struck by the increasing divergence between two organic tendencies which are a
  product of monopoly capitalism.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, there is the evident economic contraction of both the domestic and
  world economic base of U.S. imperialism. On the other hand, there is the continuing and
  relentless drive for military expansion Both of these tendencies grow organically from
  the body politic of the capitalist class structure of exploitation and oppression.</p>

  <p>The continued existence, side by side, of these two tendencies as though they were
  independent of each other is absolutely incompatible and of necessity leads to a
  catastrophe. There is no imperialist fallback position for U.S. capitalism. There is,
  however, a socialist solution to the catastrophic sharpening of this acute imperialist
  contradiction.</p>
