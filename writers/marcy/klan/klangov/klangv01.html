    <h1>Neo-fascism in the 1980s:</h1>

    <h3>Where It Comes From</h3>

    <h4>January 25, 1981</h4>

    <p>The U.S. working class should not fall prey to the deadly illusion that the
    reemergence of the Ku Klux Klan and the growth of fascist violence in widely
    separated areas of the country is a fleeting, momentary phenomenon, soon destined to
    sink into oblivion as conditions rapidly change.</p>

    <p>This very attractive if not alluring prognosis can only disarm the broad mass of
    the people and subject them to the kind of passivity in the face of danger which can
    only lead to catastrophe.</p>

    <p>This conception of the menace of KKK and neo-Nazi terror is buttressed by
    sophisticated liberal apologetics which tell us that extremist groups like the KKK
    and neo-Nazis mushroom only during periods of so-called "national frustration," and
    that they disappear as soon as economic conditions improve and international tensions
    begin to ease. As these conditions begin to take hold, even the Reagan administration
    will tend to move away from the Right and move to occupy the center, these liberals
    say.</p>

    <p>All this we are told signifies that class contradictions will tend to soften
    rather than sharpen. In the course of this development the liberal establishment will
    again begin to assert itself and the extremists on both sides of the political
    spectrum will be cast into the dustbin of history.</p>

    <p>Moreover we are too often reminded that almost every capitalist politician who has
    achieved some prominence nationally has had to denounce and condemn fascist violence
    and the neo-Nazis.</p>

    <p>Even Ronald Reagan and James Griffin, the reactionary, racist mayor of Buffalo, N.Y.,
    have had to denounce the Nazis and the KKK as did the former mayor of Philadelphia,
    Frank Rizzo, and his like.</p>

    <p>Finally, it is said (and this is all too true) that the overwhelming majority of
    the working class, the oppressed, and their allies are dead set against the Nazis and
    the KKK.</p>

    <p>Of course, Tom Metzger, the Imperial Wizard of the California KKK, got almost
    33,000 votes, or 15% of his Republican opponent's more than a quarter-million votes
    when he ran for Congress in 1980. And fascist Gerald Carlson won 32% of the primary
    vote in Detroit in a Republican contest for Congress. But the numerical or electoral
    strength of the combined Nazi-KKK forces appears infinitesimally small if arrayed
    against the tens of millions in the electorate.</p>

    <p>However, posing the question on an arithmetical as against a political basis is
    the most fraudulent of all methods of assessing the subsequent evolution of basic
    trends in contemporary capitalist society. Unquestionably the Nazis and KKK are
    infinitely small groups when one compares them to the mass of the U.S. population. It
    is not however their numerical strength which has significance (although it is not to
    be discounted).</p>

    <h3>Symptom of capitalist disease</h3>

    <p>It is the symptomatic importance of the rise of the KKK and neo-Nazis which is of
    greatest moment in apprehending the direction that events are surely taking. The
    Nazi-KKK menace in the U.S. is a symptom of a profoundly significant disease which
    has become congenital to the entire social system of capitalist exploitation and
    oppression.</p>

    <p>If the growth of the KKK and the Nazis were an isolated phenomenon divorced from
    the degenerative effects of monopoly capitalism, if these groups had no ties to and
    were not supported, encouraged, and promoted by formidable sections of the ruling
    class, they would be merely a sterile and stagnant combination of racist thugs, even
    though they are oriented to prey upon growing unemployment, economic dislocation,
    skyrocketing prices and the cost-of-living. But that is not at all the case.</p>

    <p>The growth of fascism everywhere has been securely tied to big business; that is
    its lifeline.</p>

    <p>A case might be made for the liberal apologists' view under the following
    conditions. If there were a prolonged softening of the class struggle, rather than
    its growing acuteness on a world scale; if a swift and protracted economic recovery
    on a truly high level of production were in the wind, if an easing instead of an
    aggravation of international tensions were to come, if a sharp drop rather than a
    tremendous hike in swollen defense expenditures were really to take place in the
    immediate period ahead.</p>

    <p>Such conditional "ifs," however, are wholly unwarranted by the very grim realities
    of the present situation as it continues to develop.</p>

    <h3>Liberals don't speak for monopolist bourgeoisie</h3>

    <p>If the bourgeois liberal view as a class force represented the viewpoint or the
    orientation of the capitalist establishment as a whole, as it did on occasion in the
    past, its forecast would have to be taken into account, at least as one element, in
    appraising the evolution of political trends in the period ahead.</p>

    <p>But the liberal bourgeoisie, for the most part, is a cast-out element. It has been
    in the process of decline for a very considerable period. Far from speaking for the
    capitalist establishment, it is trying desperately to retain some toehold by
    propitiating the rightists in the imperialist firmament.</p>

    <p>The ruling class as a whole have rejected and disqualified the orientation of
    bourgeois liberalism. They are not full of optimism about a speedy recovery from the
    deep-going economic malaise which afflicts all of society, and whose burden falls so
    heavily on the shoulders of the workers and the oppressed.</p>

    <p>Rather than seeking peaceful solutions to international problems, the new
    Reaganite administrators of the capitalist state are hell-bent on war. They may
    decide to talk softly and cover themselves with pacifist phraseology for a period of
    time, but mainly for the purpose of gaining time to gear up the war machine and
    militarize the country as a whole.</p>

    <p>The two most formidable and preponderant elements in the capitalist establishment
    &ndash; Big Oil, that untrammeled octopus which pervades every nook and corner of social
    existence in the country, and the unbridled military &ndash; are the most prone to promote
    lawlessness and extra-legal, extra-parliamentary and paramilitary force to gain their
    ends. They, together with the military-industrial complex are the very infrastructure
    of contemporary capitalist society.</p>

    <p>It is they who finance the growth of a thousand-and-one single-issue reactionary
    organizations and who cannot but look benignly upon and covertly finance KKK and
    neo-Nazi thugs. To them it is just one more covert operation which for public
    purposes is out-of-bounds of the legal framework of the capitalist government.</p>

    <p>The array of giant multi-national corporations that compose the monopolist
    bourgeoisie are all connected in one way or another with the military and Big Oil
    either being subjected by them or allied with them in friendly, cooperative, "shared"
    areas of collaboration. None of the monopolist bourgeoisie any longer lean in or even
    give the semblance of leaning in a liberal direction.</p>

    <h3>End of free trade</h3>

    <p>The end of the free trade policy by Chrysler and Ford, and tomorrow by others,
    spells out political adventurism abroad and vicious reactionary assaults on the
    living standards of the masses at home. The launching of a new export drive by the
    U.S. to pump up the capitalist economy only succeeds in fueling the militarist
    inclination to protect and defend whatever growing war expenditures the giant
    monopolies and multinational conglomerates muster.</p>

    <p>All this cannot but inevitably provoke a resurgence of the working class and
    oppressed masses to meet the menace of political reaction unloosed by the ruling
    class.</p>

    <h3>Big Oil and military</h3>

    <p>Of all the fallacies concerning U.S. politics, the worst is that which seeks to
    divorce and separate the most vicious and outrageous symptoms of capitalist reaction
    from the development of the degenerative aspects of monopoly capitalism.</p>

    <p>It is Big Oil and the military which have unloosed the general political reaction
    and brought in the Reaganites to administer the state.</p>

    <p>The old hands were good and praiseworthy in some areas of their stewardship (so
    goes the right-wing palaver), but the new hands will be firmer, more brutal. Indeed,
    they openly boast that they have an "SOB factor," which is popularly conceived to be
    mere nastiness when, in reality what is meant is the promotion and execution of dirty
    tricks and covert paramilitary operations, not only abroad, but also at home.</p>

    <p>The financing and the spread of neo-fascist and downright KKK and Nazi groupings
    is a logical supplement to the legal repressive and terrorist apparatus of the
    capitalist state in times of need. For that reason, a short-lived perspective in
    fighting the fascist menace is erroneous.</p>

    <p>The struggle against fascism, which is only in its embryonic form at the moment,
    must entail the perspective of involving the broadest social forces of present-day
    society in the struggle against capitalism. Capitalism is the fountainhead of
    political reaction in general and of KKK and neo-Nazi terror in particular.</p>

    <p>It is impossible to conduct a consistent antifascist policy unless one takes into
    account the key and decisive factor in overwhelming and destroying the fascist
    menace; it is the working class, the oppressed people and their allies.</p>

    <p>There can be no substitute, however one tries, for involving the broadest masses
    of workers and oppressed to overwhelm the fascist threat.</p>

    <p>The fascist menace cannot be legislated out of existence. The employment of legal,
    judicial and other methods in the struggle against fascism is necessary and often
    indispensable as a prerequisite to winning the broadest sections of the masses. But
    reliance upon the capitalist state to effectuate political measures directed against
    the threat of fascism is a hopeless, deadly illusion.</p>

    <p>Nowhere, and at no time, has a capitalist government ever effectuated legislation
    clearly directed against fascism and proscribed existing fascist organizations
    without at the same time also limiting and proscribing the existence of
    revolutionary, working-class organizations.</p>

    <p>The general tendency of capitalist legislation against fascist organizations
    generally comes down to banning "subversive organizations in general," which is an
    umbrella formula to prohibit progressive working-class and revolutionary
    organizations while at the same time protecting and defending the right-wing and
    fascist organizations.</p>

    <h3>Lessons of Buffalo, N.Y.</h3>

    <p>The Buffalo experience has shown in microcosm what the bourgeoisie is capable of
    doing when faced with a fascist threat.<a href="#fn1">[1]</a> <a name="ret1" id=
    "ret1"></a> When the mayor of Buffalo was finally forced to take cognizance of the
    Nazi-KKK demonstration, he and the capitalist establishment, with the complete
    cooperation of (if not in conspiracy with) the capitalist media, moved to ban the
    anti-fascist demonstration under cover of banning both the right and the left.</p>

    <p>This is a classic example of how a terrified capitalist city administration reacts
    when challenged by a neo-Nazi-KKK threat. First, they try to do nothing. Then they
    get their liberal friends and luminaries to ridicule the neo-Nazi menace and say that
    it doesn't exist. And then when the menace shows determination to demonstrate in the
    heart of the city, they advise the workers and the oppressed to boycott it, ignore it
    in the face of racist murders which have yet to be solved.</p>

    <p>When all this fails and when a counter-demonstration against the KKK and Nazis
    shows promise of encompassing a broad coalition of civil rights, progressive, and
    working-class organizations to effectively confront the KKK and Nazi thugs, then (and
    only then) does the capitalist city administration assume its posture of "fighting"
    against the Nazis. But how? By presumably banning both demonstrations, but in reality
    aiming to ban only the anti-fascist demonstration.</p>

    <p>What was truly important about the Buffalo experience was that a militant and
    progressive coalition demonstrated a determination to go through with its
    demonstration in the face of an illegal and unconstitutional ban. And finally the
    mayor and the capitalist establishment were forced to abandon the ban in the face of
    this militant and inflexible determination to hold the demonstration and not
    surrender the right to freedom of assembly in the face of the combined threats by the
    capitalist government, the press and the police.</p>

    <p>In a further effort to try to displace, discredit, and frighten the mass of the
    people away from the militant anti-fascist coalition, the mayor and the city
    administration were obliged to sponsor their own government-supported and
    establishment-controlled rally to honor Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>

    <p>Intransigence, which is so indispensable in any working-class struggle, did not
    alone account for the victory of the anti-fascist progressive coalition in Buffalo.
    It was also careful assessment of the political relationship of forces in the area
    and in the country. It was good, efficient organization, free from any dogmatic
    approach to the phenomenon of fascist violence, free from sectarianism. It was
    reliance on the mass of the workers and progressives, and attempts to achieve the
    broadest possible alliance with all elements willing, ready and able to put up a
    vigorous struggle.</p>

    <p>Buffalo was a microcosm of what the ruling class can and will do in the face of a
    fascist menace. It is also a microcosm of what can be done by the working class
    movement to achieve victory in the face of what appear to be overwhelming odds.</p>

    <h5>Footnote</h5>
	
	<p><a name="fn1" id="fn1">1.</a> The Nazi Party announced it would
    demonstrate in Buffalo, N.Y., on January 15, 1981, Martin Luther King's birthday. This
    came at a time when a string of shocking racist murders of Black men had occurred in
    this same city. A coalition of labor progressive and community groups immediately
    called for a counter-demonstration. It was only then that the mayor of Buffalo banned
    <strong>all</strong> demonstrations. Two thousand people demonstrated anyway against
    two Nazis heavily guarded by police. <a href="#ret1">[return]</a></p>
