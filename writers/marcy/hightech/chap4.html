  <h3>Chapter 4</h3>

  <h1>The Changing Character of the Working Class</h1>

  <p>During the early phase of the Cuban Revolution, Che Guevara came to New York to
  attend a UN General Assembly session. During his brief stay, he arranged some private
  meetings with progressives.</p>

  <p>In the course of conversations about the U.S. and Cuba, he was asked whether changes
  in the administration here would deter U.S. aggression against Cuba. He replied that a
  great deal depended on changes in the U.S. working class.</p>

  <p>These remarks were all the more interesting because at the time Guevara was regarded
  only as a popular and victorious guerrilla leader. It didn't appear that he was in a
  position to take into account the condition of the working class. What the progressive
  elements in this country, especially the militants among the youth, were concerned with
  then was a rebellion of oppressed people in alliance with progressive elements. Most of
  them discounted the working class as such. It is significant, therefore, that Che saw
  great changes in the U.S. to be contingent on great changes in the working class.</p>

  <p>At that time (Dec, 1964) the U.S. was in a period of so-called capitalist
  prosperity. Aside from some minor capitalist recessions, it continued until the steep
  economic crisis of 1974-75.</p>

  <p>Whether there would be fundamental changes in the consciousness of the U.S. working
  class has been a topic of debate for many years. Most anticipation of change in class
  and political consciousness has been geared to the ups and downs of the capitalist
  economic cycle.</p>

  <p>Of course, for most of this century, if not for the entire course of capitalist
  development, that's the way it has been. Political attitudes have changed with economic
  conditions. The ups and downs in the cycle of capitalist economic development have been
  seen as the fundamental driving force in changing political consciousness, outlook and
  participation as a whole.</p>

  <h3>The new social composition of labor</h3>

  <p>There is, however, a new and fundamental trend which has to do not only with the ups
  and downs of the capitalist economic cycle, but with the social composition of the
  working class. It is an objective trend that arises out of the changes in the
  technological structure of capitalist industry, which in turn have changed the working
  class itself.</p>

  <p>We have written elsewhere<sup><a href="#fn1" name="ref1">1</a></sup> about
  the change as it pertains to the growing proportion of Black, Latin, Asian, Native,
  women and undocumented workers. That, however, could be interpreted as a mere numerical
  change, or one&nbsp;that is related to "ethnicity," as they phrase it in bourgeois
  sociology.</p>

  <p>But the change in social composition goes beyond that. It involves a relative
  reduction in the percentage of skilled workers and a tremendous increase in the number
  of semi-skilled. Also, on an overall scale, it means the creation of lower-paying jobs
  as against higher-paying ones. It means the decline of the traditionally more
  privileged workers and industries with higher wages and the creation of a vast pool of
  lower-paid workers. This trend is still surfacing and has yet to be given any kind of
  independent political expression.</p>

  <p>From a class point of view, it is truly one of the most profound, socially
  significant trends to emerge. The number of lower-paid workers is bound to increase at
  the expense of the more privileged workers.</p>

  <p>Since we wrote on this subject in 1984, much data has appeared substantiating the
  shift in social composition of the working class. It is worth repeating a section of
  our earlier document here.</p>

  <p>Today the working class is of a thoroughgoing multinational character. The
  significance of this profound change has yet to be fully assessed.</p>

  <p>Statistics appear almost daily in the bourgeois press which show how much of the
  working class today is Black, Latin, Asian, Native as well as women. The most recent
  study shows that white males are no longer predominant in industry. The workforce is
  already composed of over 40% women. And notwithstanding the heavy Black and Latin
  unemployment, their percentage of the workforce continues to increase significantly.
  All of this is readily admitted in the bourgeois press.</p>

  <p>But what has not been pointedly brought to the attention of the public is that the
  working class as a whole in the U.S. has changed dramatically in another sense. The
  predominance of the skilled over the unskilled, of the higher paid over the lower paid,
  has narrowed continually. . . .</p>

  <p>Marx pointed out in <em>Capital</em> that, even at the height of capitalist
  development, during a period of upsurge, labor productivity increases as a result of
  the introduction of labor-saving devices and this tends to diminish the number of
  skilled members of the working class as against the unskilled. This has the effect of
  changing the social composition of the working class. It matters a great deal because,
  in terms of political struggle, the objective basis is laid for political leadership to
  be assumed by the more numerous segment of the class.</p>

  <p>If we take into consideration that the working class has changed both socially and
  from a socio-ethnic-national point of view, one can say that there has taken place a
  wholesale change in the social composition of the working class.</p>

  <p>The highly skilled have long predominated politically over the unskilled. This is
  not necessarily confined to the crafts such as carpenters, plumbers, electricians and
  so on. The rise of the basic industries such as steel and auto in the earlier decades
  also had the effect of retaining the influence of the higher paid, particularly in what
  were regarded as heavy industries.</p>

  <p>What has happened, particularly in the last decade, is that the very speed of the
  introduction of high technology, the very sophisticated type, has undermined the
  privileged sectors of the working class (such as those in steel and auto) on a world
  scale and has begun a leveling process which has undermined the living standard of the
  working class as a whole.</p>

  <p>However, it has shifted the objective basis for political leadership in the working
  class movement away from the more privileged sectors of the working class toward those
  very numerous working class elements which have had little political influence and been
  less articulate over the years.</p>

  <p>What high technology has effectuated, therefore, is a sharp shift from higher-paid
  jobs to lower ones. It is not to be wondered at that the phrase 'high tech creates
  low-paying jobs' has now become vogue. And therein lies the essence of the
  transformation of the social composition of the working class.</p>

  <p>To be sure, it is not a finished process by any means, nor can such a process be
  finished. But it is a basic trend in the evolution of the working class. While it
  continues to ravage the living standards of the workers, at the same time it lays the
  objective basis for the politicization of the workers, for moving in a more leftward
  direction and for organization on a broad scale. The political consciousness that ought
  to correspond to the new material conditions of life has lagged behind, as it almost
  always does.</p>

  <p>During the stormy, near-revolutionary working class struggles of the 1930s, it was
  unthinkable that hospital workers would be organized or that they could carry out an
  effective strike, as more than 50,000 hospital workers are now doing in New York City.
  That the hospital strikers are more politically conscious and a more militant element
  of the working class can easily be verified by even a chance acquaintance with
  them.</p>

  <p>In almost all of the service industries, particularly those in food processing,
  department stores, grocery chains, transportation, the large wholesale and retail
  businesses throughout the country, as well as the so-called new industries which have
  sprung up as some of the old ones have decayed, there is a growing preponderance of
  new, low-paid workers. The labor force has shifted from what it was decades ago--a
  mostly urban white working class--to one that is of a multinational character, which
  does not at all enjoy the privileges which accompanied the earlier rise of the
  capitalist system in the U.S.</p>

  <p>So when we talk of the working class as a class today, it is a different class than
  what existed a hundred years ago or even 30 years ago. The bourgeoisie tries to hide
  the profound social and political significance of this transformation of the working
  class. The bourgeoisie tries to portray the growing number of so-called service workers
  as 'white collar,' 'administrative,' and even 'middle class.' In other words, it tries
  to divorce the service and clerical proletariat from the rest of the working class.</p>

  <p>Again and again their continuous flood of statistics is tendentiously interpreted
  against the proletariat, as though the service workers are not wage workers who are
  exploited along with the rest of the working class. But this is a fallacy. . . .</p>

  <p>Since this was written, many articles, studies and reports have verified this basic
  trend. One of the most comprehensive and at the same time most concise was the special
  series of reports we mentioned earlier by the Council on International and Public
  Affairs entitled "The Underbelly of the U.S. Economy: Joblessness and Pauperization of
  Work in America."</p>

  <p>These reports showed that unemployment in the U.S. is grossly understated by the
  Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) because it routinely does not count "discouraged
  workers" who have given up hope of finding a job and because it does not take into
  account the wages lost by those who can only find part-time work. More pertinent to the
  point at hand, however, was the section on pauperization of work, which included the
  following:</p>

  <p>Joblessness is only one aspect of the changing nature of work in America. The
  pauperization of work is increasingly evident. According to a recent BLS study, for
  example, of the persons who lost full-time jobs during the recession and were able to
  find reemployment, 45.7% were only able to find part-time or lower paying jobs than the
  ones they lost. Of the 5.1 million reported on in the BLS study who lost jobs during
  the recession, 45.1% were unable to find jobs at all.</p>

  <p>Most of the new jobs created during the recovery, furthermore, have been low-paying,
  while high-paying jobs, especially in manufacturing, have continued to decline. Since
  1982, 87.8% of new jobs created have been in the service sector. Of these, 73.7% have
  been in the lowest paying categories of that sector--namely, retail trade and health
  and business services. A full-time job in the retail trade (many are part-time) pays
  only $9,251 a year, well below the 1984 poverty line of $10,610."<sup><a href=
  "#fn2">2</a></sup></p>

  <p>This report contained a number of tables (see Tables 2 and 5 in Appendix B)
  containing data to substantiate these observations. The table on "Comparison of weekly
  earnings in manufacturing and retail trade" shows how the&nbsp;shift away from
  manufacturing has affected wages. As the report explained, "The discrepancies are
  substantial between the service-producing and the goods-producing sectors. Thus, the
  hourly wage in the retail trade is only 62.8% of the hourly wage in manufacturing,
  while the discrepancy in weekly earnings is even greater (retail is only 45.7% of
  manufacturing). This higher discrepancy is a reflection of the incidence of part-time
  work in the retail trade. In September 1985 workers in manufacturing averaged 40.7
  hours a week while those in the retail trade averaged only 29.6."</p>

  <p>The report continued, "These 'pauperizing' trends in wages, furthermore, now affect
  an increasing proportion of the labor force--and those sectors that are growing the
  fastest--while the number of workers in the high-wage sectors is either flat or
  declining."</p>

  <p>One bourgeois theory has it that the change in the social composition of the working
  class is due to the capitalist industrial cycle. They attempt to show that the service
  sector, as they call it, and high tech are relatively immune to the capitalist crisis,
  and are therefore able to grow while the "smokestack" sector of the economy is
  shrinking. However, no sector of the economy is immune to capitalist economic crisis.
  It affects all industries sooner or later. It's just a matter of time.</p>

  <p>The very protracted banking crisis, which has been in the process of development
  since 1981 but has been artificially avoided by monetary devaluation and government
  takeovers, is sure to break out eventually and accelerate the overall crisis. This will
  not be confined to the industrial sector but can take on vast international
  proportions.</p>

  <p>Automation in large insurance companies and other so-called financial service
  organizations is eliminating thousands of what were once considered secure white-collar
  jobs. Even middle management people are being discharged wholesale in corporations like
  Ford and General Motors, while every merger leads to the elimination of hundreds of
  office as well as production workers.</p>

  <h3>The "feminization" of labor</h3>

  <p>For more than a century, women in increasing numbers have worked in industry in this
  country. Employers never objected in principle to hiring women when there were profits
  to be made off their labor. Even before World War I, women were employed in large
  numbers in such industries as textiles, where working conditions were abominable and
  wages barely above starvation level. It was in response to these conditions that in
  1908 tens of thousands of women workers demonstrated in New York City on March 8, and
  this led the Socialist International two years later to proclaim that date as
  International Women's Day.</p>

  <p>Protective legislation for workers was especially weak with regard to the sweatshops
  that employed women. Over 140 women textile workers, most of them very young, died in
  the Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire in 1911 because of the woefully inadequate safety
  codes regulating industrial buildings in New York and other manufacturing cities.</p>

  <p>Not only women but children were cruelly exploited in those days (as they continue
  to be in agriculture up to this day). Wages were so low that whole families had to work
  long hours in the factories just to put food on the table. From 1916 to 1933, three
  different attempts were made in Congress to legislate an end to child labor, but all
  three were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. It wasn't until after the
  tumultuous labor struggles of the 1930s that industry finally accepted the Fair Labor
  Standards Act of 1938, which set a minimum age of 16 for work in most industries.</p>

  <p>The labor shortage created by World War II was what finally opened up the
  higher-paying industrial jobs to women. The war tremendously spurred the development of
  the capitalist economy, and for the first time such services as daycare centers were
  set up to facilitate more women being able to work full time. When the war ended, a
  major propaganda effort was made to get women to leave the factories and return to the
  home, yet in 1948 32.7% of women were in the labor force.</p>

  <p>The further development of the processes of capitalist production has forced many
  more women out of the home and into the work force. It is these objective trends more
  than any subjective factors which have broken up the old family structure headed by the
  male bread winner. The pauperization of labor, which we have already discussed, has
  made it imperative that women work.</p>

  <p>Much has been written about the "feminization" of labor, most of it bemoaning the
  demise of the "white male prototype." In 1983, for the first time, "white men, the
  prototype of the American worker since the beginning of the nation, no longer [made] up
  the majority of the country's work force."<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> The
  chauvinist view is that women and Third World workers have taken away the jobs of white
  men. But this reactionary formulation of the question is also demonstrably false.</p>

  <p>As a further report in the "Underbelly" series by Morehouse and Dembo shows, "While
  men have certainly been dropping out of the labor force, their relatively high paying
  jobs, mostly in manufacturing, have simply disappeared, not been taken by women.
  Instead women have flocked to low paying, often part-time jobs in the service sector,
  many below the poverty line or in the 'poverty zone.' "&bdquo;&sbquo;<sup><a href=
  "#fn4">4</a></sup></p>

  <p>By early 1986, women made up nearly 44% of the civilian employed population. But the
  jobs available to them were generally so low paying that more and more women and their
  children were falling below the poverty line, in spite of the fact that more women were
  working than ever before.</p>

  <p>Taking into account what they call the Jobless Rate, which factors in the effect of
  part-time and seasonal employment, Morehouse and Dembo conclude that "The increased
  participation of women in the work force, often because of increased overall Jobless
  Rates as well as quality and pay of jobs secured by women, has done nothing to
  alleviate the poverty of women and children, and in most cases has paralleled a
  worsening in their condition. Thus, the number of females below the poverty level has
  increased both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of women in the population, from
  14.1 million (13.8% of all women) to 20.1 million (16.8%)." (See Table 4 in Appendix
  B.)</p>

  <p>It is the objective processes of capitalist production, accelerated as we have seen
  by the great changes introduced by the scientific-technological revolution, that are
  responsible for this significant pauperization of the work force. Capitalist
  commentators, however, often persist in putting the cart before the horse and blaming
  women for lowering wages.</p>

  <p>The trend described in the "Underbelly" report continues, as a column in the
  financial section of the <em>New York Post</em> in February 1986
  confirmed.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> Entitled "Lower wages paid to women reduce
  real average earnings," it showed that real wages had been dropping ever since 1978,
  and that this was linked to the fact that more women had joined the work force than
  men.</p>

  <p>"Between 1980 and December 1985," said the article, "the number of males in civilian
  employment rose from 57.2 million to 60.2 million--an increase of 5.2%. In contrast,
  total female employment rose from 42.1 million in 1980 to 48.0 million in December
  1985, an increase of 14%, or about three times the proportionate rise in male
  employment."</p>

  <p>Explaining that the new women's jobs were almost all in the lower-paying service
  sector, the article concluded that "the reason for the decline in average real hourly
  earnings as a whole may be the increased presence of females in the employment growth
  figures. This failure of real wages to remain constant may explain in part the failure
  of real economic growth in the U.S. in recent years. The rise in employment, about
  which the administration has congratulated itself, has not produced a proportionate
  rise in real GNP because so much of the employment increase has been in the form of
  female employment at substantially below average hourly earnings."</p>

  <p>These figures can help one appreciate the tremendous significance of the struggle
  that women have launched for "comparable worth"--the concept that jobs which require a
  comparable level of skill, training and intensity should receive equal pay. When
  applied in areas like public service jobs, where secretaries and typists have always
  been paid much less than maintenance workers, for instance, it has meant a substantial
  raise in pay scales for women, that is, for those workers traditionally in the
  lowest-paid categories.</p>

  <p>The struggle for comparable worth has broad implications for labor as a whole, since
  it is an effort to level wages <strong>upward</strong> by increasing the wages of the
  lowest-paid at a time when the whole thrust of the capitalist economy is to level wages
  <strong>downward.</strong></p>

  <h3>Changing composition of capital</h3>

  <p>We want to demonstrate that the more or less constant growth in the reservoir of
  lower-paid workers is precisely the result of the loss of skilled jobs and growing
  unemployment as well. It's not possible to understand this problem, let alone adopt a
  correct trade union and working class strategy, unless one comes to grips with its
  economic origins.</p>

  <p>The bourgeois press is full of the wonders of high technology and the introduction
  of robots in almost fully&nbsp;automated factories. But they neglect to mention an
  extremely important element in the economic laws of motion governing capitalist
  society: robots do not produce surplus value.</p>

  <p>As Marx demonstrated long ago, machinery or constant capital is the result of past
  labor and past surplus value. Profit does not come from machinery itself. It is the
  labor of a worker, known in Marxist terms as variable capital, that produces surplus
  value, from which profit is derived. Workers produce a greater value than they receive
  back in wages, and it is the unpaid portion of their labor that produces surplus value.
  But a robot is not a worker. A robot is fixed or constant capital, which does not
  produce profit. Only unpaid human labor produces profit.</p>

  <p>With fewer workers and more constant capital, the organic composition of capital
  changes, resulting in a falling rate of profit. This is an invariable law of the
  capitalist process of production. It cannot be gotten around.</p>

  <p>The more dead or constant capital and the less human or variable capital used in
  production, the higher the organic composition of capital. This invariably leads to a
  decline in the rate of profit.</p>

  <p>Despite this, the individual capitalists are driven to substitute labor-saving
  machinery for workers because it gives them a competitive advantage. For a certain
  period, the capitalist who is able to utilize the new technology and lower the unit
  cost of his product can actually enjoy a greater profit because the market reflects a
  generalized cost still based on the old technology. Eventually, however, the new
  technology itself becomes generalized and the rate of profit falls.</p>

  <p>The advantage to a higher composition of constant capital is always temporary.
  Moreover, it spurs on destructive competition, in which much equipment that could still
  be socially useful is made prematurely obsolete.</p>

  <p>In order to compensate for the falling rate of profit, the owners are forced to
  increase the <strong>volume</strong> of profit. This can only be done by further
  increasing production.</p>

  <p>The world steel industry is probably the best example of how the decline in the rate
  of profit, which results from the changing organic composition of capital, leads to a
  glut of steel, contributing to another cyclical capitalist crisis.</p>

  <p>The decline in the rate of profit leads to a flight of capital to where the rate of
  exploitation of the workers is higher. This does a lot to explain why the capitalist
  government is forever pushing a drive for exports in order to escape the diminishing
  rate of profit in the home market.</p>

  <p>The Reagan administration, for example, has strenuously pushed the export drive
  while at the same time trying to put up high tariff walls, or ban imports, with a
  variety of weapons including monetary manipulation.</p>

  <p>However, the point we want to make is that the modernization campaign here and in
  other capitalist countries amounts to an intensification of the exploitation of labor,
  with the introduction of higher and more sophisticated machinery until we reach the
  robot stage.</p>

  <p>Much of the economic literature deals with the displacement of jobs as the result of
  the introduction of high technology, but it does not deal with the decline in the rate
  of profit from the long-range point of view. Technology is a double-edged weapon.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, automation does not solve the problem of the capitalist contradiction
  that leads to economic crisis. On the contrary, it exacerbates it precisely because of
  the decline in the rate of profit.</p>

  <p>High technology does not produce high profits. It increases the productivity of
  labor, but decreases the proportion of labor used in production in relation to the
  amount of fixed capital. Without labor no amount of high technology can produce surplus
  value, which is the unpaid portion of labor.</p>

  <p>How can there be unpaid labor without laborers in the factories? Robots are dead
  labor. For the production of surplus value you need living labor.</p>

  <p>While this may have little immediate significance from the point of view of profit,
  it has immense long-term significance.</p>

  <h3>Decline in trade union strength</h3>

  <p>The trade unions are the strongest, most formidable and fundamental organs of
  working class struggle and have a tremendous potential to lead the mass of workers in
  this country (more than 106 million as of 1985). According to the AFL-CIO study
  referred to in Chapter 1, "Unions represent over 20 million working men and women in
  the U.S. Organized labor remains a vital force for progress in this nation. . . ." The
  union movement has made tremendous strides in the struggle for higher wages and better
  conditions and has fought over the years for progressive labor and social legislation,
  notwithstanding the hostility of various U.S. administrations of both big business
  parties.</p>

  <p>However, the report added that "union membership has shown a decline in absolute
  numbers as well as in percentage terms. The proportion of workers who are eligible to
  join a union and who in fact belong to a union has fallen from close to 45% to under
  28% since 1954; using the measure of percentage of the entire workforce, the decline
  has been from 35% to under 19%."</p>

  <p>Of course, the objective basis for this has been the ravages of two capitalist
  crises--one in 1974-75 and one which began in early 1979 and, with slight ephemeral
  upturns, continues to the present day. These crises have been accompanied by an
  anti-labor offensive which, as we said earlier, was in full swing even before the
  Reagan victory and became unmistakable with the breaking of the PATCO strike. Those are
  the objective factors.</p>

  <p>However, there is also the subjective factor, the traditional labor relations
  policy, the collective bargaining approach which is summed up in the AFL-CIO report:
  "Organized labor believes that each worker is entitled to a fair day's pay for a fair
  day's work; that pay should include a share in the profits the worker helps to create,
  and thus unions seek a larger share of those profits than 'market forces' might
  dictate."</p>

  <p>This century-old, vague, ambiguous formula disregards the most basic and fundamental
  reality of labor relations: that the relations between the employer and the employee,
  the boss and the worker, have their foundation in the existence of irreconcilable class
  antagonisms. These antagonisms do not lend themselves to solution by such vague terms
  as fairness and justice when each class views morality and justice from a different
  perspective. These different and opposing conceptions are based upon the struggle over
  the paid and unpaid portions of labor.</p>

  <p>This formula, furthermore, ties wages to the vicissitudes of the capitalist market
  with its ups and downs. The tremendous toll this takes in a capitalist recession is
  responsible for the long stream of concessions forced on the workers. In the wake of a
  capitalist crisis, the bosses have a free hand to fix wages to their sales, and to
  demand higher productivity, which can only reduce the workforce.</p>

  <p>In its section dealing with advancing the interests of the workers, the AFL-CIO
  report suggested that workers "in some bargaining units may not desire to establish a
  comprehensive set of hard and fast terms and conditions of employment but may
  nonetheless desire a representative to negotiate minimum guarantees that will serve as
  a floor for <strong>individual bargaining,</strong> to provide advocacy for
  individuals, or to seek redress for particular difficulties as they arise. In other
  units a bargaining approach based on solving problems through arbitration or mediation
  rather than through ultimate recourse to economic weapons may be most effective." (Our
  emphasis.)</p>

  <p>Of course, even the most militant and aggressive unions have had to resort to
  mediation and/or arbitration when the situation required it. But coupling this with
  individual bargaining foreshadows a weakening of collective bargaining, which instead
  must be strengthened.</p>

  <p>As the report further showed, there are about two million workers in unionized
  plants who are not members of any unions. The weakening of the collective bargaining
  process as outlined in the above quote will do nothing to bring this large body of
  workers into the union fold.</p>

  <p>There are recommendations in the AFL-CIO report which are helpful and attempt to
  improve the situation of the unions, but as we have mentioned above it does not go to
  the gut issues of the problems. Its view of the evolution of work totally ignores the
  reality of exploitation and the private ownership of the means of production by the
  bosses.</p>

  <p>All the more conspicuous is the absence of any reference to the special exploitation
  of Black, Latino, Asian, Arab and Native workers, women, lesbians and gay men, disabled
  and undocumented workers. It is supposed that all are included in the generalizations
  made in the study, but unless these special oppressions are given special attention, it
  can only be seen as utter neglect.</p>

  <p>A more detailed report on overall union membership, summarized in the <em>New York
  Times</em><sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> showed the shift away from skilled jobs in
  concrete terms.</p>

  <p>The United Steel Workers (USWA) "had 572,000 members as of June 30, about half as
  many as it had in the 1970s. Membership in the United Auto Workers (UAW) was down 35%
  to 974,000. The union had more than a million and a half members in the 1970s." The
  Rubber Workers declined by 33% to 106,000, the report said, down from 158,000 in the
  1970s. The International Association of Machinists (IAM) had 520,000 members, a decline
  of 22% from as late as 1979, when it had 664,000 members, and a decline of 37% from
  1969, its peak year with 850,000 members.</p>

  <p>Membership in the ILGWU was down to 210,000, a 40% drop from 1977 when it stood at
  350,000. Also the International Typographical Union (ITU) had fallen more than 50% in
  the previous 15 years from 89,000 in 1969 to 38,000 in the first six months of
  1985.</p>

  <p>By sharp contrast, however, "the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has
  undergone a dramatic growth. The union, which had 505,000 members in 1977, had 688,000
  members this year."</p>

  <p>It is this highly significant shift from the higher paid to the lower paid which is
  dramatically changing the social composition of the working class, greatly increasing
  the importance of the so-called ethnic composition of the working class, that is, the
  number of Black, Latin, Asian, women and other oppressed groups, particularly the
  millions of undocumented workers. Inadequate attention is paid by the AFL-CIO to this
  multinational composition of the working class.</p>

  <p>It is this aspect of the changing situation of the workers and their unions which
  has to be given great prominence as the most important significant phenomenon to have
  emerged from the development of the scientific-technological revolution. This profound
  change is not only unseating traditional labor relations but has made obsolete the
  prevailing conceptions and strategic approaches of the official labor leadership of the
  trade union movement.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the bosses are trying to exploit the inertia in the officialdom,
  especially the top echelons, of the trade unions and take advantage of a lack of bold,
  truly progressive and militant innovation to put across their own formula for change,
  which is to deepen dependency and conformity to the will of the bosses and to insist on
  thoroughgoing cooperation with management.</p>

  <h3>Prospects for a classwide movement</h3>

  <p>Up until now when the word movement was used, it could mean either the Black
  movement, the Latino movement, the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, the
  lesbian and gay movement or the women's movement. But the term seldom if ever referred
  to the working class movement. By and large the progressive movement as a whole was
  more or less separate from the working class.</p>

  <p>Now, however, the change in the social composition of the working class lays the
  objective basis for a movement of the working class itself, of which these movements
  will become so many constituent parts.</p>

  <p>When we speak of the women's movement or the anti-war movement or the Black movement
  as part of the working class movement, it doesn't mean they won't have an independent
  character. Of course they will. But they will be part of the working class movement
  because it will have come alive as the fundamental class in society which alone can
  weld these movements together in a genuine anti-capitalist and progressive struggle, a
  struggle both for democratic rights and for socialism.</p>

  <p>The change of consciousness which has so long been delayed could not have come
  earlier merely as a result of episodic turns in the capitalist cycle. But it is bound
  to come as the result of deep-seated, profound changes in the social composition of the
  working class.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie have initially viewed this trend as a favorable sign for class
  collaboration. But they will soon become disillusioned.</p>
