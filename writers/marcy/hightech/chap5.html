  <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

  <h1>Black Labor From Chattel Slavery To Wage Slavery</h1>

  <p>The scientific-technological revolution has affected and will continue to affect
  Black workers much more significantly than is commonly acknowledged by the capitalist
  press. Automation takes even more than its usual toll when oppressed people are
  concerned. It intensifies racist oppression and increases unemployment among Black
  people even when a capitalist economic recovery is said to be sharply on the rise, as
  in 1983-84.</p>

  <p>But the impact of the scientific-technological revolution on Black people is not
  only a recent phenomenon. It has historical roots that go back to the beginnings of the
  slave trade.</p>

  <h3>The compass and the slave trade</h3>

  <p>The speed and momentum with which the&nbsp;scientific-technological revolution
  has&nbsp;taken off in recent&nbsp;years has tended to&nbsp;shrink into insignificance
  inventions which exercised a profound influence on developing social relations in the
  early stages of the capitalist system. Take the compass, which is regarded today as a
  basic direction-finding device in navigation. It is not a capitalist invention. It is
  said to have been discovered as early as the year 1100 in China, and may have also been
  discovered independently in Europe somewhat later; it was used by Arab sailors in the
  early 13th century.</p>

  <p>Its development and perfection over the years became indispensable to world trade.
  While not invented in a period of capitalist development, the compass and other
  navigational instrumentation were appropriated from earlier modes of production by
  capitalist shipping companies at the very crest of the period of colonization, what is
  called the "age of discovery." It gave a tremendous impulse to world trade and
  commerce.</p>

  <p>But what was the content of this trade? Why is it important in relation to our study
  here? Because as trade became a world phenomenon, it was essentially an international
  trade of slaves.</p>

  <p>Millions upon millions of Black people were kidnapped, tortured, and brought on
  slave ships to the vast new continents of the Western Hemisphere. The slave trade began
  in the mid-15th century when Spain and Portugal began importing a significant number of
  Black slaves to their plantations on the Canary and Madeira islands. Most of the very
  same leading imperialist powers that are today concerned with maintaining the South
  African regime in the face of the revolutionary mass movement there earlier
  participated in, promoted and in fact fought ferociously to maintain the slave trade
  and obtain a monopoly over it.</p>

  <p>Modern transnational monopolies differ fundamentally in their economic content from
  those days, but they still show the same greed and avarice, the utterly unprecedented
  cruelty and barbarous treatment which characterized the slave trade. This is what lay
  behind the flourishing of world commerce, and laid the development for what Marx later
  called the primitive accumulation of capital. The word primitive was not a
  characterization of the many millions of people captured as slaves. The term primitive
  was applied to the fiendish method by which the early capitalists accumulated the
  primary, original capital that was so indispensable for the development of their system
  of oppression and exploitation. Not only Spain, Portugal, England, France and Holland,
  but also Denmark, Sweden and Prussia participated, garnering fabulous profits as a
  result of the slave trade.</p>

  <p>The compass was one of the things that made the slave trade possible, but it alone
  can't be held responsible for the transportation of this vast number of human beings
  from one continent to another thousands of miles away--away from their homeland and
  loved ones to a strange new country where the whip and the gun held them at bay.
  Scandinavian people had made a transoceanic voyage earlier, in the 12th century. They
  too may have had a compass of a sort, for it is well known that the Vikings undertook
  long voyages and established settlements in Iceland, Greenland and even
  Labrador.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> But these voyages
  differed fundamentally in that they were oriented toward settlements in the northern
  part of the world in harmony with the climatic conditions of the Scandinavian
  countries.</p>

  <p>Until the development and perfection of navigational instrumentation such as the
  compass, the Western world was mainly confined to the Mediterranean and the coastal
  areas of the Atlantic so far as maritime commerce was concerned. The new era of
  discovery and colonization opened up the Atlantic for the first time. This could not
  have been done without the necessary technological improvements in navigational
  instrumentation as well as in the making of ships.</p>

  <p>By 1745 the English inventor Gowin Knight had perfected a method of efficiently
  magnetizing needles of harder steel. He designed a compass with a single bar needle
  large enough for a cap resting on the pivot to be screwed into its center. He thus
  greatly improved the compass.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> &sbquo; This significantly
  shortened the time of voyages, increased the safety of the ships and, what is of
  greater social and political significance, increased the volume of slavery.</p>

  <p>As Marx was to write, "It is slavery that gave the colonies their value; it is the
  colonies that have created world trade, and it is world trade that is the precondition
  of large-scale industry. Thus slavery is an economic category of the greatest
  importance."<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>

  <p>The contract for supplying slaves to the Spanish colonies was called the Asiento.
  While British slave traders provided the necessary laborers for their own plantations,
  Spain contracted with the slave traders of other nations to supply its needs. The first
  Asiento was granted in 1518 to a Flemish company, and it specified that a certain
  number of tons (!) of slaves be delivered to the Spanish colonies.&bdquo;<sup><a href=
  "#fn4">4</a></sup></p>

  <p>The Portuguese were the first traders to hold the Asiento, but the other rising
  capitalist powers were not to be outdone. The Dutch broke into this very lucrative form
  of trade around 1640 and Spain, France and Britain followed soon after.</p>

  <p>The war for the Asiento continued until the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) when the
  English triumphed over their competitors. The English bourgeoisie from then on
  maintained control of the slave trade through the Royal African Company. This slave
  trade covered not only the English, French, and Dutch colonies in America and the West
  Indies but also the vast land of Brazil. It was in this way that such a vast portion of
  the African people were uprooted and thrown into the vortex of capitalist slavery.</p>

  <p>In connection with Holland it should be noted that earlier, in the years 1636-37,
  the Dutch had engaged in a flourishing trade and development of tulips, for which they
  are still world-famous today. But that trade attained extraordinary speculative
  proportions so that at one period just one tulip was valued at thousands of dollars.
  Eventually the market broke and the Dutch bourgeoisie turned from trafficking in "a
  thing of matchless beauty" to the slave trade, one of the most odious, foul and
  certainly the most inhuman forms of commerce ever seen in history. This illustrates
  with what ease and facility the capitalists can plunge from one area to another in
  their insatiable appetite for profits, without any regard for human values whatever.
  The latter are totally irrelevant in the process of capitalist production. Capital
  simply flows to wherever profits are highest.</p>

  <h3>The banks and the drug trade</h3>

  <p>The world slave trade has been superseded by the world drug trade. It has been
  widely reported that today marijuana,&nbsp;whose cultivation is illegal, has become the
  single most valuable cash crop in U.S. agriculture. This should not surprise anyone in
  light of the fact that some of the biggest banks have been fined millions of dollars
  for laundering money, that is, disguising deposits from the criminal underworld engaged
  in the sale of not only marijuana but heroin and cocaine. The age of telecommunications
  has made it possible for the banks and the criminal underworld to work as partners.</p>

  <p>The underworld, even if not part of the establishment, can't help but integrate
  themselves with the banks. They want the interest on their money! Drug busts used to
  yield amounts in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. This then escalated into the
  millions. Recently some drug busts have netted loot worth more than a billion dollars!
  It has escalated because it is so lucrative--like the slave trade. And what is the
  interest on a billion dollars? At just 6%, it comes to <strong>sixty million
  dollars.</strong> The banks have to get involved in the drug trade, because it is a
  lucrative source of deposits which are then loaned out at a profit.</p>

  <p>The summits of high finance are involved. Among the banks caught red-handed have
  been Bank of America, the biggest in the country, and the First Boston Corporation.
  Bank of America was fined $4.75 million and First Boston half a million. Chase
  Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Chemical, Crocker National and Irving Trust
  Company have had to pay civil penalties ranging from $210,000 to $360,000 for reported
  violations.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> &hellip; What are they hiding? The deposit
  of profits from the criminal underworld engaged in destructive drug trafficking which
  takes an especially great toll in the oppressed communities. Legality and illegality
  coexist under the capitalist system and always have. Even after the slave trade was
  outlawed, it continued despite harsh penalties, as does the drug trade.</p>

  <p>At a time when the banks are so heavily involved in unrecoverable loans worth
  hundreds of billions of dollars in connection with the indebtedness of oppressed
  countries, how many would not resort to this most modern and technologically advanced
  artifice to support their credit positions?</p>

  <p>The observations made over a century ago by a certain T.J. Dunning, and quoted by
  Marx in <em>Capital,</em> ring all too familiar today: "With adequate profit, capital
  is very bold. A certain 10% will ensure its employment anywhere; 20% certain will
  produce eagerness; 50%, positive audacity; 100% will make it ready to trample all human
  laws; 300%, and there is not a crime at which it will scruple, nor a risk it will not
  run, even to the chance of its owner being hanged. If turbulence and strife will bring
  a profit, it will freely encourage both. Smuggling and the slave-trade have amply
  proved all that is here stated."<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> &dagger;</p>

  <h3>The invention of the cotton gin</h3>

  <p>While the compass as a technological device&nbsp;in the field of navigation was
  appropriated&nbsp;by the developing&nbsp;bourgeoisie from an&nbsp;earlier mode of
  production dating back many hundreds of years, the invention of the cotton gin in 1793
  belonged strictly to the era of capitalist development. Its invention was called forth
  by the development of capitalist trade and commerce. Its influence on slavery was
  stupendous.</p>

  <p>A great deal has been written about Eli Whitney as the inventor of the cotton gin
  and as a great scientist, which he certainly was. However, according to some
  accounts,<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> the first gin made in Mississippi was
  constructed on the basis of a crude drawing by a skilled slave. This was probably not
  very unusual in light of the fact that even among the first slaves brought to this
  country from Africa, many were skilled craftsmen. Also in both the South and the North
  there were skilled free Blacks. Since the slaves were never recognized in law as
  persons, the slave owners could appropriate their property as well as any inventions
  they might conceive of.</p>

  <p>The cotton gin has often been described as the very soul of simplicity. However, it
  should be borne in mind that cotton has been spun, woven and dyed from the earliest
  times. Cotton formed the staple clothing of India, Egypt and China. Hundreds of years
  before the Christian era, cotton textiles were woven in India with matchless skill and
  their use spread to the Mediterranean countries. In the first century, traders brought
  fine muslin and calico to Italy and Spain. The Arabs introduced the cultivation of
  cotton into Spain in the 9th century. By the 17th century, the East India Company was
  bringing rare fabrics from India.</p>

  <p>Before the arrival of the Europeans in the Americas, cotton was skillfully spun
  there and woven into fine garments and dyed tapestries. Fabrics were found in Peruvian
  tombs that even belonged to pre-Inca cultures. Cotton was first planted by the
  Europeans in Virginia's Jamestown Colony in 1607.</p>

  <p>The so-called Cotton Belt in the U.S., where cotton has historically been the main
  cash crop (now marijuana is!), extends through North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
  Alabama, Mississippi, west Tennessee, east Arkansas, Louisiana, east Texas, and south
  Oklahoma, and also in smaller areas of southeast Missouri, southwest Kentucky, north
  Florida, and southeast Virginia. But prior to the invention of the cotton gin, cotton
  production was at a very low level. It was almost insignificant in the prevailing
  Southern economy. The plantation system rested mainly on tobacco and to a lesser extent
  on rice and indigo.</p>

  <p>Rarely has an important technological development taken place which was as simple as
  the cotton gin. It separated the seeds from the cotton through a process using a
  cylinder with bent spikes sharpened to form hooks. They were set in a ring and revolved
  through slots in a bar. The teeth pulled away the lint, which was then cleaned from the
  teeth by brushes. A hand crank operated the whole machine.</p>

  <p>What did this machine accomplish? As Eli Whitney himself explained in a letter, "The
  machine makes the labor 50 times less without throwing any class of people out of
  business."<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup> Of course, the slave economy was not
  characterized by unemployment, unlike wage slavery.</p>

  <p>The cotton gin tremendously increased the productivity of Black slave labor on the
  plantations. The figures in cotton crop production speak for themselves. In 1790,
  before the use of the cotton gin, the cotton crop of the U.S. amounted to 1.5 million
  pounds. By 1800 it had risen to 35 million pounds. By 1810 it had soared to 85 million
  pounds and by 1860 it reached the astonishing sum of 2 billion pounds.</p>

  <p>The introduction of the cotton gin thus brought about a profound social revolution.
  A machine that could increase the productivity of labor 50 times was nothing less than
  sensational. It thoroughly revolutionized Southern agriculture as well as Northern
  production methods.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it was in response to the tremendous social transformation evoked by
  the Industrial Revolution in England, which had brought about a skyrocketing demand for
  cotton and a sharp price increase. As Marx explained it in broader terms, "A radical
  change in the mode of production in one sphere of industry involves a similar change in
  other spheres. This happens at first in such branches of industry as are connected
  together by separate phases of a process, and yet are isolated by the social division
  of labor, in such a way, that each of them produces an independent commodity. Thus
  spinning by machinery made weaving by machinery a necessity, and both together made the
  mechanical and chemical revolution that took place in bleaching, printing, and dyeing,
  imperative. So too, on the other hand, the revolution in cotton-spinning called forth
  the invention of the gin, for separating the seeds from the cotton fiber; it was only
  by means of this invention, that the production of cotton became possible on the
  enormous scale at present required."<sup><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> &permil;</p>

  <p>But how did it affect slavery itself, this "peculiar institution" as it was called
  at the time? Did the sensational, spectacular development in technology retard slavery
  or expand it?</p>

  <p>From the time school children attend their earliest classes they are taught about
  the wonders of modern science and what a liberating influence it has. Did the cotton
  gin at the time help to weaken slavery, as the general conceptions cultivated and
  promoted by the bourgeoisie maintain? As we shall see, it strengthened slavery. And
  this happened at a time when it appeared (although it was only appearances) that
  slavery was in a decline.</p>

  <p>Here it is necessary to look at the currents of thought which gave political
  expression to this phenomenon. For instance, the Continental Congress of 1774 proposed
  that the practice of importing slaves be stopped. Rhode Island and Connecticut passed
  laws providing that all chattel slaves brought within their respective provinces be
  freed, and Delaware prohibited the importation of bondsmen in 1776. Later, Virginia,
  South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina and Maryland all forbade the importation of
  slaves.</p>

  <p>The slave trade itself, of course, was finally prohibited in the U.S. more than a
  decade after the introduction of the cotton gin, in 1808. But it should not be
  forgotten that the Constitutional Convention of 1788 wrote a clause into the
  Constitution making it impossible as a matter of federal law to abolish the slave trade
  on a national basis before 1808.</p>

  <p>The demise of the slave trade has to be viewed in the light of class interests,
  first of the slavocracy itself. Why would they as slaveowners be interested in
  abolishing it? Why, for instance, would George Mason of Virginia, himself a slave owner
  and supporter of slavery, condemn the slave trade as "diabolical itself and disgraceful
  to mankind"?<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup></p>

  <p>Only by piercing the veil of capitalist hypocrisy, only by going behind the
  political rhetoric and seeking out the materialist interests of any given class, only
  by applying the materialist interpretation of history and analyzing social and
  political phenomena in terms of class interests, can we understand the politics, the
  social and political values. Thus the basic reason behind abolishing the importation of
  slaves even in the above-named Southern states and castigating the trade as a "disgrace
  to mankind" was the fact that there had been a huge influx of slaves. Like the
  excessive influx of any commodity governed by the law of supply and demand, this
  cheapened the price of a slave. The reasons behind it were economic in origin, masked
  in moralistic phraseology.</p>

  <p>A surplus of slaves in some of the Southern states motivated the agitation against
  further importation. Most of this agitation, it should be noted, was before the use of
  the cotton gin really took off on a mass scale, producing unprecedented profits.</p>

  <p>But there was also opposition to the slave trade motivated by an entirely different
  set of circumstances. This was a thoroughgoing revolutionary development which is
  highly obscured in U.S. history, particularly as it relates to the early struggles of
  the Black people before the Civil War. This revolutionary development fired the
  imagination of the enslaved Black people in this country and frightened the ruling
  class, both North and South.</p>

  <h3>The Haitian Revolution and U.S. slave revolts</h3>

  <p>This inspiring event was the successful revolution in Haiti led by&nbsp;its famous
  hero, Toussaint L'Ouverture.&nbsp;This great revolutionary development overthrew French
  colonial rule and then defeated massive British, Spanish and French interventionist
  forces in one of history's really brilliant political and military upsets.
  Unfortunately, the significance of this great revolutionary development has been
  obscured and dimmed in this century, especially over the past few decades, by the
  existence of the U.S.-supported Duvalier dictatorship over the Haitian people. Now that
  the Haitian masses are once again rising to shape their own destiny, the significance
  of the Haitian Revolution is sure to be rehabilitated.</p>

  <p>Both in France and here in the U.S., the master class referred to the Haitian
  revolutionaries as "Black Jacobins," after the most radical and determined party in the
  French Revolution which had helped to inspire the Haitian Revolution. The Jacobins had
  attempted to go beyond the confines of the emerging capitalist system in France.</p>

  <p>The Haitian Revolution of 1791-1803 established the first republic in the vast
  colonized area of the Caribbean and Latin America. But it remained isolated. It wasn't
  until this century that the Mexican Revolution, the brilliant achievements of the Cuban
  Revolution, the developing revolution in Nicaragua, and the many national liberation
  efforts throughout the Western Hemisphere began the long-delayed overthrow of
  imperialist domination in this hemisphere. This struggle has yet to come to completion
  and finish the processes begun by the great revolution in Haiti.</p>

  <p>The American Revolution itself had unloosed a progressive current against slavery as
  part and parcel of the independence struggle. Genuine revolutionaries like Thomas Paine
  and others, unlike many among the "founding fathers," opposed slavery from the
  viewpoint of real freedom of the people and were not beholden to either the Northern
  industrialists or the Southern slavocracy.</p>

  <p>But the most basic reason why some slave owners and others among the growing
  bourgeoisie felt the need for restraint on the importation of slaves and even the
  elimination of slavery was fear of <strong>domestic insurrection.</strong> This
  important motivating factor behind the opposition to slavery has not been given the
  attention it rates. For many, many decades the heroic slave insurrections were
  completely minimized and given scant attention.</p>

  <p>The insurrections given the most detailed accounts in modern literature were those
  of Gabriel in Virginia (1800), Denmark Vesey in Charlestown, S.C. (1822), and most
  famous, that of Nat Turner in South Hampton County, Virginia (1831). <sup><a href=
  "#fn11">11</a></sup></p>

  <p>However, a great many insurrections took place which are only beginning to be taken
  note of. The Civil War itself demonstrated many instances of insurrections by the Black
  people. The Black masses under slavery were not the passive, docile force imagined by
  bourgeois historiography, especially in the literature predating the mass movement of
  Black people in this century.</p>

  <p>Black rebellions go back in history to the very beginnings of slavery in this
  country. As early as 1687, "one year previous to the Glorious Revolution in the mother
  country," the revolution in England that consolidated the power of the bourgeoisie as
  against the old feudal aristocracy, there was "widespread revolt throughout the
  colonies and at a time when the Negro population of the Old Dominion was about equal to
  that of whites. . . . That was the attempted insurrection in Northern
  Neck."<sup><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> All were executed when the plot was discovered
  and the revolt was crushed.</p>

  <p>How interesting, in light of present-day developments in South Africa, that the
  Virginia Council placed a ban on public funerals for the dead slaves in fear that they
  would bring out mass demonstrations and might even provoke another rebellion!</p>

  <p>One thing to remember in connection with the early slave insurrections is that they
  were influenced politically by the English Revolution and, much more profoundly, by the
  French Revolution. The great revolutions of this century (especially in Russia, China,
  Cuba, Viet Nam, and Angola and now the emerging revolutionary struggle in South Africa)
  have also had the most profound effect among the exploited and oppressed masses
  everywhere.</p>

  <p>The spectacular success of the cotton gin in raising the productivity of labor of
  the slaves tremendously strengthened the South, strengthened slavery and impelled the
  slaveholders to become not only more aggressive and bellicose but, far more important,
  more expansionist. Slavery drove into the Southwest and everywhere it could in order to
  expand its plantations and garner in unprecedented profits. Cotton production was
  extensive in character, appropriating more and more land, rather than intensively
  applying mechanical devices. It drove the slaves harder and harder, often beyond
  endurance.</p>

  <p>But the very invention which had become such a tremendous advantage to the Southern
  planters, like all social phenomena, soon began to develop one of the sharpest social
  contradictions which ultimately would undo the slavocracy altogether.</p>

  <h3>Slavery vs. capitalist production</h3>

  <p>The South was a slavocracy based on an ancient mode of production within the
  geographical confines of a new world social order, the bourgeois social order with its
  own mode of capitalist production. One of the fundamental differences between the
  bourgeois mode and older modes of production so eloquently brought out in the
  <em>Communist Manifesto</em> is that "The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly
  revolutionizing the instruments of production and thereby the relations of production,
  and with them the whole relations of society." <sup><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup></p>

  <p>How does this stack up with the Southern slavocracy? Marx continued, "Conservation
  of the old modes of production in unaltered form was . . . the first condition of
  existence for all earlier industrial classes." The South tried to retain the old
  slavocracy not only in unaltered form but in extreme rigidity. It was therefore on a
  collision course with the new bourgeois order, with the process of capitalist
  production and its tremendous growth in the North.</p>

  <p>Another and more flagrant contradiction was that one of the fundamental
  characteristics of the capitalist mode of production is <strong>wage slavery,</strong>
  which means a free proletarian, that is, a worker free to sell his or her labor on the
  capitalist market. Capitalist production and the extraction of surplus value in the
  interest of further capitalist accumulation is virtually impossible without a free
  working class, free to be exploited and oppressed, free to be unemployed. Chattel
  slavery was thus thoroughly incompatible with wage slavery.</p>

  <p>Slavery as an economic institution has everywhere proved itself uneconomical. This
  is especially true when it depends on one great crop such as cotton, with diminishing
  reliance on sugar, rice and other products. The South was turning into a monocultural
  economy.</p>

  <p>Over all, the spectacular leap in technology on which the Southern planters depended
  so heavily to maintain slavery was only one of many scientific and technological
  developments in an era which was rapidly turning them out in greater and greater
  numbers. In this respect the South was falling far behind the North.</p>

  <p>The North was making all the great strides in science and technology. It built up
  great universities which became centers for basic research. Whatever prominence the
  South had had in science in the earlier days, it was losing to the North. Seen in terms
  of the contemporary struggle in technology of the U.S. against Japan and Western
  Europe, the South was steadily losing ground to the North in what we would call today
  the technological race.</p>

  <p>As a competing form of economic and social system compared to the social system
  based on capitalist production, slavery was hopelessly out of place and had no chance,
  save by the use of sheer force. Slavery was static, fixed and extremely rigid in its
  form of production. It was also characterized by the most outlandish forms of cruelty
  and brutality. The capitalist system, on the other hand, while certainly not
  characterized by either compassion or humanity, was nevertheless "revolutionizing" its
  means of production, that is, it was advancing science and technology. The change from
  chattel slavery to wage slavery was a profoundly revolutionary change, a tremendous
  social transformation. But historically it constituted a change in the
  <strong>form</strong> of exploitation, not its abolition.</p>

  <p>Thus we see that while the first phase of the scientific-technological revolution
  brought fabulous profits to the South and gave it the power to expand, it ultimately
  undid slavery. Just as technological change undermined the Southern slavocracy, so will
  it make obsolete the present industrial financial plutocracy with its system of wage
  slavery.</p>

  <h3>Black scientists and inventors</h3>

  <p>It is beyond the province of this study to give an accounting of the many scientific
  inventions made, particularly during the last half of this century. The modern epoch in
  which the bourgeois system of production has predominated has been abundant in
  scientists and inventors whose contributions have laid the material foundation for
  present-day society.</p>

  <p>However, there has been a systematic attempt in the U.S. to omit the very
  significant contributions of Black scientists. Popular science books available to the
  public contain the names of only a small number of Black inventors and scientists.</p>

  <p>There are 14 Black scientists who are acknowledged to have made outstanding
  contributions to science, yet the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> (1980 edition) lists
  only four. Conspicuously absent is Norbert Rilleux (1806-1894). He is one of three
  Black scientists who actually revolutionized an industry. In Rilleux's case it was
  sugar refining. By inventing the vacuum-pan evaporator, he transformed the sugar
  industry of the world.</p>

  <p>That his name could be forgotten in a country which produces and consumes more
  refined sugar per capita than any other is hard to conceive of except on the basis of
  flagrant racist prejudice.</p>

  <p>Until 1846, sugar cane juice was transformed into sugar by a very primitive, costly
  and slow process. Rilleux's invention replaced the manual operation with a mechanical
  one. As Louis Haber tells us in his <em>Black Pioneers of Science and
  Invention,</em><sup><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup> slaves had formerly transferred the
  sugar cane juice from one boiling kettle to another by means of long ladles. With
  Rilleux's device, a single worker could operate the completely enclosed machine through
  outside valves. It was Rilleux and George Washington Carver (1860-1943) who rescued the
  South from being transformed into a hopelessly backward agricultural adjunct to the
  North, similar to the role played by the southern part of Italy until very
  recently.</p>

  <p>Carver, however, is much too well known throughout the world for his reputation to
  be obscured. It was Carver's work in soil improvement and the diversification of crops
  which made him famous. He discovered hundreds of uses for the peanut, the sweet potato
  and the soybean and thus stimulated the culture of these important crops. He also
  derived many products from cotton wastes and extracted blue, purple and red pigments
  from local clay.</p>

  <p>Many industries sprang up as a result of the use of peanut products. It helped to
  stimulate the Southern economy to the extent that many farmers found it more profitable
  to engage in the production of peanuts than tobacco.</p>

  <p>Carver also demonstrated that from the pecan, which grew well in the South, could be
  extracted 75 different products. When there was an overproduction of cotton, Carver
  showed how it could be used to make insulating board, paper, rugs, cordage and even
  paving blocks for highways.</p>

  <p>Carver's achievements were perhaps best summarized by President Franklin D.
  Roosevelt, who said upon his death: "The world of science has lost one of its most
  eminent figures and the race from which he sprang, an outstanding member. . . . The
  versatility of his genius and achievements in diverse branches of the arts and sciences
  were truly amazing. All mankind are the beneficiaries of his discoveries in the field
  of agricultural chemistry. The things which he achieved in the face of early handicaps
  will for all time afford an inspiring example to use everywhere."<sup><a href=
  "#fn15">15</a></sup></p>

  <p>A third great Black scientist who transformed and revolutionized an entire industry
  was Jan Matzeliger (1852-1889). Although much less known than his two eminent fellow
  scientists, he invented what at the time seemed an impossible feat--a machine which
  would mass-produce shoes. Matzeliger accomplished for the shoe industry what Eli
  Whitney's gin did for the cotton industry of the South.</p>

  <p>While it's true there were a number of machines in use in the shoemaking industry
  around the time of Matzeliger's invention, none seemed to have been able to connect the
  upper to the sole of the shoe. It was believed such a thing could not be done.</p>

  <p>Matzeliger's machine did it. It could turn out a complete shoe. At first the machine
  made a record run of 75 pairs of women's shoes in one day. Later Matzeliger's machine
  made as many as 700 pairs of shoes a day. It also reduced the cost of shoes by half and
  was soon being applied on a worldwide scale.</p>

  <p>In industry there were at least four more Black scientists who made very significant
  contributions to the development of science and technology but are little known. One
  was the man who invented the automatic lubrication of machinery, Elijah McCoy
  (1844-1929), whose work gave rise to the expression "the real McCoy." Before his time a
  machine had to be stopped in order to be lubricated.</p>

  <p>Then there was Granville T. Woods (1856-1910), who developed so many electrical
  inventions that he was known as the Black Edison. There was also Lewis H. Latimer
  (1848-1928) who advanced electric lighting and Garrett A. Morgan (1877-1963) who
  invented the traffic light.</p>

  <p>In this century a number of Black scientists have made outstanding contributions in
  the field of health and medicine. Charles R. Drew perfected techniques to preserve
  blood plasma which made possible the use of blood banks. Percy L. Julian developed
  synthetic cortisone which, among other applications, is helpful in combating the pain
  of arthritis. Lloyd A. Hall found ways to sterilize foods and medical supplies. Ernest
  E. Just became a leading authority on cell physiology. Louis T. Wright made advances in
  critical antibiotic research and Daniel Hale Williams performed the first open heart
  surgery.</p>

  <p>There was, however, one early Black scientist whose special importance, aside from
  his inventive genius, was in the field of political struggle against oppression and for
  equality: Benjamin Banneker (1731-1806). In most texts he is described as the surveyor
  who laid out the city of Washington. But he was much more than that.</p>

  <p>Banneker was a scientist, astronomer, mathematician, clockmaker and surveyor.
  Earlier we alluded to Samuel Slater, the Englishman who invented a textile machine and
  who, when prohibited from bringing his plans for the machine to this country, memorized
  the blueprints and then reconstructed the machine from memory. Benjamin Banneker was
  able to lay out the city of Washington after memorizing much more detailed plans to
  which he had had only limited access as an assistant.</p>

  <p>Originally a young Frenchman had been given the job of planning and laying out the
  capital. Banneker was one of his three assistants. The young Frenchman got into a
  dispute with Thomas Jefferson and as a result took his plans and left for France,
  leaving Jefferson in the lurch. Banneker stepped forward and volunteered to do the job
  on the basis of what he retained in his memory. That's how the city was finally laid
  out.</p>

  <p>Banneker made the first clock ever built in the United States. He built it entirely
  of wood and carved each gear by hand. The clock kept perfect time and people from all
  over the country came to see it. Banneker should also be remembered for the almanac he
  prepared in 1792 and each year thereafter for ten years.</p>

  <p>What is politically significant in Banneker's history is that he was the only
  contemporary of Thomas Jefferson to challenge him on the issue of equality. Every
  school child is taught that Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence
  which contained this famous sentence: "We hold these truths to be self evident, that
  all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
  inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of
  happiness."</p>

  <p>But Jefferson was also a wealthy slave owner, and even though he sold off all his
  slaves toward the end of his life his concept of equality did not extend to Black
  people. He had also written that "the Blacks are inferior to the whites in the
  endowment both of body and mind." This was no chance statement. The collection of
  Jefferson's works demonstrates that these sentiments appeared widely in his
  writings.</p>

  <p>Even though the 18th century became known in history as the Enlightenment,
  especially the years following the revolutions in the U.S. and France, Jefferson held
  to his reactionary, racist view of Black people. None of the outstanding leaders at the
  time directly took Jefferson to task for the flagrant contradiction between the florid
  language he used in the Declaration of Independence and the ugly practice of slavery,
  which in fact was validated in the Constitution.</p>

  <p>It remained for Banneker to use his almanac for this purpose. He attached to it an
  eleven-page handwritten letter that systematically took apart Jefferson's lofty
  proclamation of inalienable rights while at the same time condoning the vicious
  practice of slavery. This was one of the few, perhaps the only, direct attacks on
  Jefferson, the man who to this day along with Andrew Jackson is honored by the
  Democratic capitalist politicians at their annual Jefferson-Jackson Day dinners as a
  symbol of democracy and freedom.</p>

  <p>Banneker's letter to Jefferson did oblige the latter to back off somewhat. In a
  letter dated August 30, 1791, Jefferson thanked Banneker: "I can add with truth that
  nobody wishes more ardently to see a good system commence for raising the condition
  both of their [Black people's--S.M.] body and mind to what it ought to be. . . . I do
  see such proofs that you exhibit that nature has given to our Black brethren, talents
  equal to those of the other colors of men and that the appearance of the want of them
  is owing merely to degraded condition of their existence both in Africa and in
  America."</p>

  <p>Jefferson said he was taking the liberty of sending Banneker's almanac to the French
  Academy of Sciences because he considered it a document "to which your whole color has
  a right for their justification against the doubts which have been entertained of
  them." It is only because of Banneker's struggle for equality and against oppression
  that Jefferson, who held such an eminent position in U.S. history as a liberal, was
  forced to retreat somewhat from his racist views.</p>

  <p>By way of acknowledgment, it should be said that Louis Haber in his book <em>Black
  Pioneers in Science and Invention</em> has done as much to popularize what was so
  little known about the achievements of Black scientists as Paul D. DeKruif did for
  biologists more than a half century ago in his lucid exposition, <em>Microbe
  Hunters.</em></p>

  <p>The individual scientist in the modern era of the scientific-technological
  revolution faces a vastly different world than the one in which Banneker or even Thomas
  Edison at a later date lived and worked. The role of the individual scientist has been
  diminished by the emergence of capitalist collectivism in the big business laboratory.
  Today's vast laboratory complexes are organized and controlled by the mighty corporate
  giants and employ thousands of scientists. The giant corporations compel all scientific
  personnel to sign contracts that any inventions they may develop in the course of their
  work are the property of the company.</p>

  <p>Superimposed on them is a labyrinth of laboratories directly controlled by the
  Pentagon. The great universities of today are intimate collaborators of the Pentagon
  and few have real independence as to how to allocate their scientific
  investigations.</p>

  <p>One of the truly important scientific inventions of modern times was the transistor.
  True to the age in which we live, it was developed in the laboratories of Bell
  Telephone Company in 1948 by American physicists John Bardeen and Walter H. Brattain.
  How many hundreds of scientific workers helped lay the basis for it is not really taken
  into account.</p>

  <p>When mass layoffs take place, such as we've described with AT&amp;T, what happens to
  the laid-off scientific personnel? How does it affect the pursuit of their scientific
  career? In that highly significant layoff, no breakdown was given as to how it affected
  Black scientific workers, women or other oppressed people. There's not a word as to
  whether affirmative action has been a factor in the employment of Black, Latin, Asian,
  Native, Arab and women workers, or whether the layoffs took place in accordance with
  affirmative action guidelines.</p>

  <h3>The Third World brain drain</h3>

  <p>The scientific-technological revolution has&nbsp;had a deleterious&nbsp;effect on
  Third World&nbsp;scientific personnel&nbsp;and the development&nbsp;of science and
  inventions. Immediately after the Second World War the U.S. embarked on a vast campaign
  to pirate both the technology and the scientific personnel of the other imperialist
  countries. It also started to drain the budding development of science and technology
  in the oppressed countries.</p>

  <p>With respect to the imperialist countries, it is well known how right after the war
  the U.S. brought captured German scientific personnel here to work on rockets and space
  flight. But it wasn't only from Germany. The British government under Labor Prime
  Minister Harold Wilson finally restricted what was later called the brain drain by an
  agreement that limited U.S. pirating of scientists, at least from that area.</p>

  <p>While U.S. government policy has been to restrict immigration and imprison and
  deport so-called illegal, undocumented workers, it has at the same time enticed Third
  World scientists to the U.S. On the one hand, imperialist policy through a variety of
  foundations like those endowed by the Fords, Rockefellers and others seems to be
  constantly exhorting the oppressed countries to modernize, to become innovative and
  inventive and thereby aid their industrial and technological development. But the truth
  is that every chance they get to entice Third World scientists to the U.S., they do so,
  in complete contradiction to the proclaimed policy. They not only extend the stay of
  visiting students and professors and encourage them to become citizens but also offer
  them various monetary inducements.</p>

  <p>It is one thing to defend the democratic right of individuals to choose their own
  domicile. It is another matter if this is part and parcel of a policy of monopoly
  capitalism to pillage and plunder the resources of Third World countries.</p>

  <p>The scientific personnel of less developed countries are in many respects their most
  precious resource. The brain-drain aspect of the scientific-technological revolution
  has enhanced, not diminished, U.S. imperialism's intense exploitation of the oppressed
  people.</p>

  <h3>Black labor today</h3>

  <p>Extrapolating from&nbsp;the population figures&nbsp;provided in the 1986&nbsp;annual
  report of the&nbsp;National Urban&nbsp;League on the "State of Black America," there
  are about 28 million Black people in the United States. That's larger than most African
  countries and larger than most middle-sized countries represented in the United
  Nations.</p>

  <p>By always referring to Black people as a minority, the bourgeois press obscures the
  class significance of the Black population, which is overwhelmingly working class and
  which therefore, especially when taken together with the Latin, Asian and Native
  population, adds a very significant dimension to the whole character of the working
  class here.</p>

  <p>To regard the Black struggle strictly from the viewpoint of minority-majority is to
  lose much of its profound social and political implications. What should interest
  working class students of the Black struggle, however, is that even these figures,
  which are probably understated, disclose a social viability which has strong
  revolutionary potentialities given the conditions we believe are developing that will
  give a fundamentally altered social composition to the working class.</p>

  <p>To understand the current state of Black labor in the United States, it is necessary
  to look first at the mass migration of Black people to the North which took on momentum
  early in the 20th century and reached considerable proportions at the end of the First
  World War. Mass production industries in the U.S. like auto (especially Ford) and steel
  were in a period of high capitalist development. When this culminated in the First
  World War it opened the gates of some industries and fields of economic endeavor to
  Black labor, notwithstanding rank discrimination and entrenched racial barriers.</p>

  <p>These were not relaxed. Instead artificial classifications were created so that
  Black workers doing almost exactly the same work as whites got far lower wages. Nor
  were barriers lifted in the skilled trades and AFL craft unions. These were as rigidly
  racist in their approach as they had been before the First World War. But Black labor
  continually found ways to gain skills and get skilled jobs despite government, employer
  and union racial discrimination.</p>

  <p>It should always be borne in mind that even the first boatloads of slaves who
  arrived in this country from Africa brought with them useful skills which were
  developed even in slave times. In cities like New York and Philadelphia, before the
  mass migrations from Europe started, there were a considerable number of Black workers
  in industry who had developed skills. But as more and more white labor from Europe
  became available, Black workers began to be relentlessly driven out of industry.</p>

  <p>These mass migrations from Europe undermined whatever leverage the Black workers
  might have had in industry notwithstanding discrimination. Things got more and more
  difficult for them.</p>

  <p>Capitalism as the involuntary promoter of the development of the working class also
  caused the mass migration of Black agricultural workers from the South to the North.
  Notwithstanding the racial barrier or the unemployment as a consequence of the
  capitalist economic cycle, more and more Black workers got into Northern industry even
  as the pool of Black unemployed grew.</p>

  <p>That most of the central cities of the North and now some in the South have a
  majority or a very large minority of Black people is objectively due to the
  transformation of capitalist industry with the First and Second World Wars. World War
  II in particular was a much longer war for the U.S. and entailed the construction of
  many defense facilities. In fact, the entire U.S. industrial apparatus was converted
  for war purposes and for the first time full employment became an artificial phenomenon
  dependent on war spending.</p>

  <p>These two objective factors--the First and Second World Wars--also found an echo
  beginning in 1950 with the Korean War. In the early 1950s and again during the Viet Nam
  War employment was artificially propped up by the continuing growth of the defense
  industries.</p>

  <p>If today in cities like Detroit, Chicago, Newark, Philadelphia, New York, Atlanta,
  Memphis and Birmingham there are large Black populations with some political power, it
  is not due to any attempt by the ruling class to ameliorate the condition of Black
  workers or to lighten the burden of discrimination. Rather it comes as a result of
  objective development arising out of the organic functioning of the capitalist system
  and the inevitability of imperialist wars and military interventions abroad. This is
  not to say that the whole industrial structure of the U.S. is due entirely to
  imperialist wars, but without them it is difficult to conceive how there could have
  been such a rapid social transformation in the condition of Black and also white
  workers.</p>

  <p>The mass migration from the South--and back to the South, especially during times of
  unemployment--is among the objective factors affecting the development of Black labor.
  The subjective factors arise from the freedom struggle, especially the struggle of the
  1960s.</p>

  <h3>The Black freedom struggle</h3>

  <p>It is utterly impossible to understand the contemporary role of Black workers in
  this country and particularly their situation in the trade union movement without
  considering them in a broader political framework. A study of Black labor, especially
  over the last 25 years, that omitted the general political struggle, the freedom
  struggle of the Black people as a whole, would make for a very constricted and even
  distorted view of both the great achievements of Black workers in the trade union
  movement and the equally great if not greater drawbacks of their situation.</p>

  <p>Racism has permeated every layer of capitalist society; the trade union movement
  from its earliest times up to the present has been permeated with chauvinism and
  vicious discriminatory practices. The trade unions are the most formidable working
  class organizations in the country. Aside from temporary retreats and taking into
  account the long duration of the political reaction, they are bound to become organs of
  the great struggles for emancipation from both racist oppression and capitalist class
  exploitation.</p>

  <p>But all of this has to be considered in the broader arena of the overall political
  struggle of Black people, in which the trade unions have certainly been a significant
  part, but only a part. In reality, what happens there is a reflection of what is going
  on in the Black struggle as a whole. The great battles of the 1960s and 1970s in
  particular must be considered in evaluating and analyzing how this reflected itself in
  the unions.</p>

  <p>Just to take one example out of many: In April 1969, some 500 Black workers shut
  down production at the Ford plant in Mahwah, New Jersey, for several days. The workers
  walked out because a foreman called one of the workers a "Black bastard." Although the
  official UAW leadership urged the workers to return to their jobs, they nevertheless
  stayed out until the foreman was ousted from the plant. This was the famous so-called
  wildcat strike at Mahwah organized by the United Black Brothers, and it represented a
  significant victory for all the workers.</p>

  <p>If this significant victory for the UAW at that period is seen only in the trade
  union framework, it could present an oddity. But when seen in the larger framework of
  the overall Black political struggle, one gets a far truer measure of its significance
  for the local struggle as well as nationally.</p>

  <p>There were other significant developments in the UAW that came on the heels of the
  great 1967 rebellion in Detroit and ushered in a series of electoral victories for the
  Black workers in the UAW. "Suddenly the UAW leadership stopped the practice of
  mobilizing opposition to Black candidates in local elections. Within a few months after
  the formation of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers, Black workers were elected
  as presidents of Local 900 (Ford's Wayne plant), Local 47 (Chrysler Detroit Forge),
  Local 961 (Chrysler's Eldron Gear), Local 7 (Chrysler), Local 51 (Plymouth), and even
  Local 1248 (Chrysler Mopar), where only 20% of the plant's 989 workers were Black. A
  Black was elected for the first time as vice-president of Briggs Local 21. . .
  ."<sup><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup></p>

  <p>Before the Mahwah struggle took place, there were a considerable number of political
  rebellions and insurrections of Black people. There was the Harlem rebellion, followed
  by Watts, Newark, and Cleveland, to name only a few, and of course the largest of the
  mass insurrections took place in Detroit. Following the assassination of Martin Luther
  King in 1968 there were a total of more than 500 rebellions throughout the whole
  country.</p>

  <p>How then can the struggles of Black workers for equality be seen as strictly trade
  union struggles? Few if any of the very significant gains made by Black workers could
  have been attained without the so-called outside struggle, that is, the general
  political struggle put up by Black people. That was the real catalyst, the basic
  generator for the trade union gains, many of which were not only vital but
  indispensable, considering the long and difficult task to attain equality which still
  goes on.</p>

  <p>What is said about the Black struggle applies equally and to some extent even more
  to the Latin struggle, the women's struggle and the gay and lesbian struggle. Any gains
  made in the unions must be related to the broader struggles which generated them. It
  would of course be fruitful to speculate on how different it could have been had the
  struggles been initiated by the trade union movement rather than being forced upon it.
  But this is the music of the future, not of the past.</p>

  <p>There are about 110 million workers in the U.S. today. In the mid-1980s, only about
  17.3 million belonged to unions, as we've discussed earlier. However, there can be no
  doubt that the union movement will become the fundamental lever for working class
  struggle. The anti-labor offensive which has been sweeping the country for several
  years is bound to produce one of the truly great upsurges of the working class, and
  this time the union movement will not be in the rearguard but in the vanguard of the
  struggle as regards Black, Latino, Asian, and Native people, women and lesbians and gay
  men.</p>

  <p>The tardiness of the working class response to the offensive of the ruling class in
  the face of such profound political and social reaction can be explained in part by the
  lack of a mass political party of the working class. The response from the working
  class, both organized and unorganized, is likely to come as the result of spontaneous
  outbreaks which will take the form of trade unionism but not necessarily in the way the
  trade union officialdom presides over the union movement. What more concrete form it
  will take we have to leave for events themselves to reveal.</p>

  <p>Suffice it to say that the very intensity of the political reaction, generated by
  the Reagan administration and prepared earlier by the Carter administration and its
  predecessors, has created the conditions for a tumultuous social upheaval, not a
  controlled one that could be easily manipulated by contemporary bourgeois politicians
  and the trade union bureaucracy. The very tardiness in preparing a party of the working
  class, which in Europe and other areas has taken generations to build up, makes
  inevitable that the pent-up rage at the oppression and exploitation endured by all
  strata of the working class will break out in another form. It would seem to emanate
  most easily from the workplace and from the vast pool of unemployed. The special
  oppression of women, Black, Latin, Asian, Arab and Native workers will make them a
  magnet for one another.</p>

  <p>A former science adviser to Reagan in late 1985 told a Cable News Network (CNN)
  interviewer that "unemployment in Western Europe constitutes the greatest danger to
  Western civilization." Of course, it's true! But not only in Europe. The capitalist
  "recovery" here in the U.S. has been taking place amidst some 15 million unemployed, if
  comprehensive calculations are made. Social peace cannot be maintained on such an
  explosive material base.</p>

  <h3>The impact of high tech on Black postal workers</h3>

  <p>In attempting to evaluate the impact of the scientific-technological revolution on
  Black workers as well as other oppressed people, it is best to avoid focusing our
  analysis on a narrow sector of industry. Also, while the influence of high tech has
  been most profound in industries such as auto, electric and steel, we have already
  dealt with these areas in some measure.</p>

  <p>We are also deliberately avoiding areas where racist or sexist discrimination is
  most pronounced, or where Black, Latin and women workers still constitute only a very
  small portion of the workforce. A broad sector of the economy, where there are a
  significant number of Black, Latin and women workers, is more appropriate for this
  study.</p>

  <p>By taking a sector of the economy where so-called optimum conditions prevail, where
  racist and sexist oppression is generally regarded as less significant than in other
  areas, we are better able to illustrate our theme, namely, that high tech results in
  low-wage jobs and unemployment in all sectors of the economy. This explains why we have
  chosen what seems like an unlikely area, the U.S. Postal Service, for this study.
  Furthermore it is probably the oldest service industry in the country, being created
  around the time of the U.S. Constitution in 1789.</p>

  <p>Though racism may be a less significant factor in the Postal Service than in some
  other areas, nevertheless this is the current situation for Black postal workers:</p>

  <p>"Blacks appear to be concentrated in less future-oriented Postal Service jobs. When
  racial concentration versus dispersal of employees in the Postal Service is analyzed,
  Blacks appear to be concentrated in the lower range and low-paying jobs (levels 1-6).
  In contrast, in grade levels 7 to 38, 90% of the postal employees are non-minority.
  Thus the mode of substitution in this case is by a targeted racial distribution in
  which Blacks are concentrated in the jobs most likely to be affected by technology,
  particularly the nine-digit zip code, automated mail processing and flat sorting
  technology and the electronic message systems."<sup><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup> The
  same is true for Latin and other oppressed people.</p>

  <p>During the depths of the Great Depression, work at the post office was considered
  the best and most secure job for anybody from a working class family. Even today,
  assuming there are openings, it probably offers more job security for a young person
  from a working class family than other areas. However, a great transformation is
  underway here too, although it is not publicly recognized.</p>

  <p>In 1970, during the Nixon administration, Congress enacted the Postal Reorganization
  Act (PRA). With this new law the government took decisive steps that were to have
  far-reaching significance for many millions of workers. For the postal workers it began
  a chain of developments concerning the dispatching, processing and delivery of mail
  which ultimately resulted in a loss of almost 100,000 jobs as of 1983.</p>

  <p>The PRA was the first early warning of what has become a virtual daily phenomenon,
  the so-called deregulation of industry, whose principal aim and function, despite
  claims of modernization by the ruling class, is to ditch restraining and protective
  labor legislation and to get into private hands anything they feel can be
  profitable.</p>

  <p>The PRA made a so-called independent agency of the Postal Service, which had been
  regarded as a full-fledged arm of the government with representation in the Cabinet
  since way back in 1828. The act reduced the status of the post office and turned it
  into an agency of the executive branch with an eleven-person board of governors, nine
  of them appointed by the President with the approval of the Senate, and a Postmaster
  General who is responsible to the&nbsp;President.</p>

  <p>The whole idea was to gradually shrink the vast and complex network of postal
  services, introduce a series of technological innovations and put it on a so-called
  business basis. The income and outgo of funds were to be equalized and eventually a net
  surplus was to be produced in the same way as in private industry.</p>

  <p>What has really happened since the PRA went into effect?</p>

  <p>Despite the decline in the number of postal workers from 756,000 in 1970 to 660,000
  in 1983, the Postal Service has increased its piece volume by more than 20 billion. In
  1981 alone, mail volume reached a record 110 billion pieces.</p>

  <p>Despite this growth in productivity, however, in the last contract, announced on
  December 24, 1984, the government through an arbitration panel imposed a notorious
  two-tier wage pattern on the American Postal Workers Union and the National Association
  of Letter Carriers. This meant a 25% wage cut for workers hired after a certain date.
  In time this lower wage may apply to all workers unless a combined effort of all the
  unions, not only the postal unions, is mobilized against it throughout the country.
  (The two-tier system of wage levels first got a foothold in none other than the Boeing
  company, one of the pillars of high technology in the aerospace industry.)</p>

  <p>At the same time, notwithstanding the government's bold talk about private
  enterprise standing on its own feet, it has continued a long line of luscious contracts
  to the big corporations which supply the materials to the Postal Service. In addition,
  the government is trying to weaken the "no-layoff clause" in the postal workers'
  contract.</p>

  <p>The unions have a real job on their hands whenever they have to face the government
  in high-tech negotiations, particularly with the restriction on their right to strike
  and after what the Reagan administration did with its vicious union busting against the
  air traffic controllers (PATCO).</p>

  <p>The new relationship of the government, particularly Congress, to the postal workers
  can be seen in the drastic decline in postal appropriations and share of operating
  expenses over the fiscal years 1971-83. A reactionary Congress and a reactionary White
  House have combined through the Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan years to steadily cut
  down the amount of appropriations for the post office and let the broad public carry
  the weight of financing postal operations.</p>

  <p>Of course, in those years all other vital services by federal and state governments
  were also cut down. But what is necessary to distinguish here is that the entire
  strategy has been geared toward investment in the mechanization of the dispatching,
  processing and delivery of postal services. A significant portion of the appropriations
  has been devoted to the automation of mail processing--the installation of optical
  character readers and bar code sorters in major post offices. All this is bound to
  squeeze out more workers.</p>

  <p>The aim of this automation is to save nearly a billion dollars a year in labor
  costs--which means that the jobs of many more workers, especially Black, Latin and
  women workers, are at peril. An official history published by the Postal Service itself
  says that "After the introduction of ZIP+4 in 1983, the first delivery phase of the new
  OCR (optical character readers) channel sorters and BCS (bar code sorters) was
  completed by mid-1984. When fully implemented and used with the expanded ZIP+4 codes,
  the automated system will save an estimated $960 million annually in labor costs
  alone."<sup><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup></p>

  <p>What happended to the electronic mail delivery service is instructive for seeing how
  the big corporations allow new technologies to be developed at government expense only
  to take them over themselves. The U.S. government first developed electronic
  computer-originated mail (E-COM), which went into service in 1982. It allowed
  large-volume mailers to transmit messages via computer to selected post offices, where
  they were printed out, placed in envelopes and delivered by letter carriers. But then a
  group of large private multinational companies including UPS, Federal Express and
  Western Union instigated the anti-trust division of the Justice Department to file a
  suit charging the Postal Service with unfair competition because of the low rates
  charged. Although the post office won, the so-called independent Postal Rate Commission
  then demanded that the E-COM rates be doubled, which finally forced the government to
  abandon that part of the delivery of electronic mail which pertains to domestic use.
  However, the government continues to maintain the service called Intelpost, which is an
  electronically transmitted international service.</p>

  <p>The struggle by the big carriers to dismantle the Postal Service was foreshadowed by
  a big business-inspired article in the June 1979 <em>Forbes</em> magazine entitled, "Do
  we really need the postal service?"</p>

  <p>Here it is necessary to demonstrate the close link that now exists between the
  Postal Service and the entire telecommunications industry. Real competition from any
  number of services in private industry operates as a goad to the Postal Service
  management to follow suit with each and every new mechanical innovation showing promise
  of reducing costs and hence the unit cost of labor. Essentially that is what really
  lies behind all cost-reducing programs.</p>

  <p>In the period of the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the PRA was passed, AT&amp;T
  carried out one of its devastating assaults on the mass of telephone operators, which
  took a huge toll on Black, Latin and women workers especially.</p>

  <p>What happened at AT&amp;T has exceptional relevance to the situation of the postal
  workers. Even at that time it&nbsp;had become clear that the telecommunications
  industry&nbsp;had tremendous influence in the government, and that the enactment of the
  PRA would begin active competition between private industry and the postal service,
  in&nbsp;the process liquidating many thousands upon thousands&nbsp;of jobs.</p>

  <p>However, the postal workers saw the Postal Reorganization Act in an entirely
  different context. They had just gone through their first and most important strike,
  which despite some concessions had won legitimacy for their union. This was
  accomplished even though Nixon sent the U.S. Army into the post offices of the great
  metropolitan areas of the country in an effort to intimidate and break the workers'
  resistance. That the postal workers were able to survive this and grow in strength
  explains why they won subsequent gains and concessions from the government.</p>

  <p>In all this, the historical background of the Postal Service should not be
  forgotten. Like other institutions of U.S. capitalism, it has been profoundly
  segregationist since the beginning. It was not until 1865, the last year of the Civil
  War, that the laws prohibiting, yes prohibiting!, Black people from carrying mailbags
  from stagecoach to post office were abolished.</p>

  <p>Racism has continued during the many decades thereafter, partly as a result of
  outright discrimination by white organized unions. The founding of the National
  Alliance of Postal Workers in 1913 marked a milestone in self-help organizational
  mediums by Black workers when the leadership of white organized unions would not open
  their doors to Black workers.</p>

  <p>It was not until the 1940s that Black, Latin and women workers were more freely
  admitted to the unions under the impact of many profound social changes, most important
  of which was the civil rights struggle and the upsurge of the labor movement as a
  whole. This finally made it possible for Black, Latin and women workers to take
  advantage of employment opportunities in the Postal Service.</p>

  <p>Even now, despite attrition and pending future layoffs, "minorities [since 1978]
  have steadily increased as a proportion of total Postal Service employment." Thus in
  the fiscal year 1981, a year of big layoffs as a result of the capitalist recession all
  over industry, "the Postal Service hired 10,064 Blacks, 2,765 Hispanics and 2,289 other
  minorities for a total of 15,118 or 27.6% of new employees."<sup><a href=
  "#fn19">19</a></sup></p>

  <p>Of course, with anticipated future employment reductions, the picture is not
  encouraging, particularly if one takes into account the direction the government is
  taking in pushing the replacement of workers with sophisticated technology. It is more
  and more geared to the telecommunications industry, of which the government is the
  principal supporter and promoter.</p>

  <p>However, the future of women is a different matter. Female postal employment is
  predicted to rise while the proportion of Black workers as a whole is expected to
  remain constant.</p>

  <p>The dispatch and delivery of mail are a component of the transportation and
  communications industry. Like railroad workers, truck drivers and waterfront workers,
  postal workers participate in the freight-handling process. Transportation facilitates
  the circulation of capitalist commodities and the scientific-technological revolution
  has accelerated this process. What automation has done in the Postal Service is another
  form of what containerization did in the shipping and maritime industries. The postal
  workers must view themselves as part of the communications, telecommunications and
  transportation industries with whom they have so much in common.</p>

  <p>The employers and the capitalist state have a sustained and abiding interest in
  artificially keeping the workers in these industries apart and separated. They do this
  all the more to divide Black and white. However, the scientific-technological
  revolution has forged a new link between a variety of industries which hitherto seemed
  to be very separated. It has opened up a new vista, a new horizon which lays out and
  broadens the basis for working class solidarity.</p>

  <p>The capitalist system in its early stages needed a government postal service in
  order to develop capitalist industry and communications as a whole. It could not have
  developed the productive forces without almost two centuries of a government-sponsored
  postal service. Now, with the development of telecommunications, the government wants
  to ditch that part of the service which is no longer lucrative for big business and
  high finance, and retain that portion which still facilitates big business, while
  holding a club over the heads of the postal workers through compulsory no-strike
  mediation and arbitration.</p>

  <p>Union leaders must make particularly clear that there is absolutely no valid reason
  why the capitalist government should be able to dictate the wages and working
  conditions of the postal workers and at the same time deprive the workers of their
  right to strike. The Postal Service is but one segment of the telecommunications
  industry, as are RCA, GE or AT&amp;T. It is really one connected industry and the
  demand should be made to remove the anti-strike clause against the postal workers.</p>
