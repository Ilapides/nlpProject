  <h3>Chapter 11</h3>

  <h1>Two bourgeois theories on the scientific-technological revolution</h1>

  <p>What, then, is the ultimate destiny of the scientific-technological revolution?</p>

  <p>The bourgeois economists tend to fall into two not very distinct but nonetheless
  discernible schools of thought on this subject. One of them points to the past two
  centuries, which have seen a great many technological revolutions, beginning with the
  spinning wheel, the steam engine, the railroads, and so on. They argue that insofar as
  the functioning of the capitalist social system is concerned, the
  scientific-technological revolution does not really change much--no more, they say,
  than did the introduction of the automobile as a form of transportation, superseding
  the horse and buggy days.</p>

  <p>While it is true that the functioning of the capitalist system, meaning thereby the
  exploitation of wage labor by capital, has not been fundamentally altered, the recent
  changes, however, do introduce a new social development. The older revolutions in
  technology can be compared to the scientific-technological revolution as an
  arithmetical progression is compared to a geometric one. This new revolution of course
  doesn't change the character of exploitation, but it multiplies its intensity, as the
  data we have presented discloses, and this becomes cumulative with each passing day as
  more and more statistical data is available.</p>

  <p>The other school of thought, somewhat older and more craven in its apologies for the
  system, deals with the scientific-technological revolution from another angle. Its
  view, which has been extensively covered ever since Daniel Bell relieved himself of his
  thesis of the post-industrial society, is that the new stage of capitalism tends to
  disintegrate the proletariat as it has been presented ever since the days of Karl Marx.
  This thesis says that the old working class is vanishing and is being replaced by
  middle class elements, and that the old polarization between the capitalist class and
  the proletariat is softening and the antagonisms are diminishing. These new broad
  middle layers are said to be taking on more numerical strength and to be leaving behind
  the old class antagonisms. It's a familiar enough theme.</p>

  <p>We have demonstrated earlier how high technology results in low-paid jobs. But the
  thesis of these Post-Industrial Revolution apologists is that a tremendous increase in
  white-collar workers, professionals, middle managers, administrative assistants,
  secretaries and so on--a huge group often referred to as the
  "Yuppies"--&nbsp;effectively neutralizes the potential for class struggle of the type
  of the great working class struggles of the 1930s. In their view the shrinking number
  of steel, auto and electrical blue-collar workers enhances the growth of the so-called
  middle class.</p>

  <p>Among other things, they close their eyes to the most recent data. For instance, an
  article in the <em>New York Times</em> in October 1985 dealing with recent layoffs at
  the Ford Motor Company threw light on white-collar layoffs at the giant U.S.
  corporations.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> It showed that there
  had developed a virtual campaign against office workers, similar to the anti-labor
  campaigns against blue-collar workers, but this time in the name of fighting
  "corpocracy."</p>

  <p>The article dealt with layoffs at not only Ford but American Telephone &amp;
  Telegraph, Union Carbide, General Motors, Bethlehem Steel and CBS. Now we can add ABC,
  GE and RCA to this list. You can really count in all the Fortune 500, as a matter of
  fact, for all are now engaged in what the <em>New York Times</em> article called
  trimming the "corpocracy." It is a wide-ranging and ever-deepening attack which may not
  have quite the same measure or intensity as the anti-labor campaign but nevertheless is
  just as painful and drastic for the much-touted "middle class" elements.</p>

  <p>At the earliest stage of the anti-labor offensive, some misguided officials of
  unions, in an effort to ward off layoffs, cutbacks and plant closings, demanded similar
  layoffs of management. They got more than they wanted.</p>

  <p>The post-industrial school of bourgeois economics has closed its eyes to the fact
  that the middle class itself is being polarized into two camps, one of which is
  steadily falling below its previous status while a smaller fraction whose earnings are
  supplemented by stock and bond ownership tends more in the direction of higher
  management.</p>

  <p>We discount here petty proprietors, the traditional middle class between the
  capitalists and the workers. Rather, we are dealing with the so-called new middle
  class, which bourgeois statisticians lump all together in the service sector. Now,
  banking is a service industry. So under this reasoning, Walter Wriston, the former head
  of Citicorp, the world's largest banking corporation, and all the bank's maintenance
  workers, all the window washers and cleaning people, are lumped together as service
  employees! But even this most powerful bank recently took its credit card division out
  of the city of New York and relocated it in the Middle West, thereby shrinking the
  white-collar staff, especially the so-called middle layer.</p>

  <p>What also gets overlooked completely is the assembly line character of the new
  so-called white collar workers. In fact, they are the clerical proletariat. Most are
  women, and many are Black, Latin and Asian. These jobs more and more tend to require
  less skill and give less pay.</p>

  <p>All these layoffs of the so-called middle management "corpocracy" are taking place
  in a period that has supposedly passed out of the recession of 1979 and is now enjoying
  capitalist prosperity. Again, if this is what happens in a period of prosperity, what
  will conditions be like in this solid mainstay of the capitalist system once the
  anticipated collapse is felt?</p>

  <p>All truly service-oriented industry is industry which supports manufacturing, which
  is essential to the distribution of the products of industry. The service sector is not
  an autonomous, independent factor immune to the laws of capitalist crisis. It is wholly
  dependent on capitalist industry as a whole. Economic crisis, once it hits, may reach
  it later, but it inevitably arrives. Even Paul Volcker, the conservative chairman of
  the Federal Reserve Board, has continually called attention to the relationship between
  the industrial and service sectors and how dependent the latter is on the former.</p>

  <h3>Capitalist concentration and the middle class</h3>

  <p>The bourgeois reactionary utopia of a middle class solidly in line with the ruling
  class is based on a false economic foundation. Its attempt to lump together the
  millions of low-paid workers with upper-level corporate executives from banking,
  insurance, and stock brokerage houses is a fraud. Yet even among the very top, the fear
  of economic crisis, which impels them to push the drive for mergers and acquisitions to
  the limit in a frenzy of speculative schemes, has produced the so-called golden
  parachute stratagem. It's a means whereby top executives, in fear of the ultimate
  consequences of mergers, acquisitions and buyouts, are trying to make sure that they
  have a bailout for themselves.</p>

  <p>In 1981, a Senate committee staff released a computer-aided study of data on
  corporate ownership compiled in 1980 by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
  According to the <em>New York Times</em>, the study showed "a high degree of
  concentration rooted in overlapping institutional stockholdings and interlocking
  directorates. The study found that the top levels of ownership in almost all major
  corporations are held or controlled by as few as 15 financial institutions, including
  major banks and insurance companies."<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> The conclusions of
  the study merely confirmed a trend that has been noted in similar studies made over the
  past 35 years.</p>

  <p>The study covered 100 of the country's largest companies in 17 areas of finance and
  industry, including banking, insurance, automotive, steel, energy, transportation, and
  retail.</p>

  <p>J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. through holdings it manages for others is effectively the
  first or second largest stockholder in 25 other companies studied in the report. They
  include IBM, Bank of America, Eastern Airlines, Citicorp, Sears, Mobil, General Motors,
  and General Electric. "The aggregate holdings of pension funds in large financial
  institutions like Morgan 'place them in a special position to exert control or
  influence over the management of their portfolio companies,' the Senate study
  concludes. Citicorp was found to have the most interlocking directorates--49 direct
  interlocks with the other companies and 887 indirect interlocks. A direct interlock
  occurs when two corporations have a common director, while an indirect interlock takes
  place when directors of two corporations meet as directors of a third corporation.
  Interlocking directorates among direct competitors are forbidden by federal law."</p>

  <p>The recent wave of mergers, acquisitions and buyouts, the biggest ever to take place
  in this country, has undoubtedly accentuated this trend. In almost every case, the new
  corporate entities have effected not only layoffs and plant closings, but also cutbacks
  in the professional and managerial staffs. The fear which has gripped the managerial
  staffs, especially the lower levels, in this new wave of the concentration of capital
  in fewer and fewer hands has filled the financial pages of the capitalist press. How
  could this be overlooked?</p>

  <p>Rather than presenting a false homogeneous picture of what is passed off as the
  middle class, attention should be drawn to the polarization within it. The
  concentration of capital continually lops off large segments of the former elite
  groupings in the managerial staffs and throws them onto the market to compete for
  lower-paying jobs (if they are still of an age to do so). This is the grim reality, not
  the self-serving portrait of the middle class which tries to obscure the class
  contradictions between monopoly as a whole and the various middle layers.</p>

  <p>In areas such as airlines, electronics and other high-tech industries, the Reaganite
  deregulation drive is affecting the so-called middle management layers, especially in
  the huge corporations, to the extent that it is showing up in the shrinking of mass
  markets designed to appeal to the middle class.</p>

  <p>A summary of a <em>Fortune</em> magazine article, "The Mass Market Is Splitting
  Apart," explained: "Most businessmen don't realize it yet but the middle class, the
  principal market for much of what they make, is gradually being pulled apart. Economic
  forces are propelling one family after another toward the low or high end of the income
  spectrum. For many marketers, particularly those positions that sell to the well-to-do,
  this presages good times. For those used to selling <strong>millions</strong> of units
  of their product to middle-income folks, the prospects are altogether
  darker."<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> (Our emphasis--S.M.) This illustrates the
  polarization we referred to, rather than the growing homogeneity and so-called upward
  mobility about which the second school of bourgeois economists preaches.</p>

  <p>This polarization is not only the result of the recent economic crisis. The "number
  of families with low incomes has climbed" for a longer time, said <em>Fortune.</em>
  "But the decline of the middle really began during the long expansion of the late 1970s
  when the families began to find the economic ground under them shifting." An
  accompanying chart showed the dwindling of the middle class. Below it, <em>Fortune</em>
  said: "The percentage of families in the 'middle class,' here defined as having an
  annual income of $15,000 to $35,000 in constant 1982 dollars, dropped sharply over the
  past ten years. Families at the extremes increased as a proportion of the total,
  particularly from 1978 on."</p>

  <p>This illustrates the divisiveness inherent in the nature of the capitalist economy
  in general and what the blessings of the scientific-technological revolution in
  particular bring on. It devastates not only the working class but also the middle
  sections.</p>

  <p>How they go from higher-paying to low-paying jobs was well illustrated in the late
  1985 California supermarket strike conducted by the United Food and Commercial Workers
  union and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The management of the
  supermarkets proposed creating a new job classification, meat clerk, with an hourly
  wage of $7.25, for meatcutters who performed essentially the same job but who at the
  time earned $13.48 per hour. A company official insisted, predictably enough, that
  changes in technology and services offered by supermarkets had eliminated many tasks
  previously performed by meatcutters. Where meatcutters used to handle many whole sides
  of beef or pork, the company said, a great deal of meat now arrived at stores boxed in
  smaller portions. Therefore, they insisted on this new classification. Under these
  circumstances, they insisted that the employees, whom they now called meat clerks,
  should be paid the $7.25 rate. This is really using a meat axe to cut wages!</p>

  <p>"Just because they are getting the boxed beef, that doesn't give them the right to
  put a seven-dollar an hour employee in the place of an eleven-dollar an hour one," said
  the UCFW. "These cutters," said union officials, "have been apprentices for four or
  five years, have been journeymen for seven or ten years. We can't agree to this at
  all."</p>

  <p>This struggle illustrates both the significance of the scientific-technological
  revolution as a source for super-profits for the bosses and the iron necessity of the
  unions to resist with vigor and determination.</p>

  <p>A <em>Washington Post</em> article entitled "Middle Managers Under Siege, No Longer
  Immune from Layoffs," stated: "Middle managers, the staff people long thought essential
  to a smooth-running corporation, are becoming increasingly expendable because of the
  rapid rise of office automation."<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>

  <p>The pressure to reduce the middle element has been especially strong in GM, which
  has acquired the Hughes Corporation and earlier the Electronic Data Systems
  Corporation. Investment bankers and their analysts who act as advisers to these giant
  corporations are speed-up artists in Brooks Brothers clothing who often find bulges in
  the waistlines of corporations like GM and the others. According to the <em>Washington
  Post</em> article, they found that GM had a "bloat" of white-collar workers. "It's
  temporary, say GM officials, and the pressure is on to reduce it."</p>

  <p>" 'Most of the white collar reductions will come out of the ranks of middle
  management and out of the clerical staffs,' said one of those automotive industry
  consulting firms, Peter C. Van Hull, director of Arthur Andersen and Company. 'Many
  times the middle management and clerical groups are involved in work that doesn't add
  value to the product.' " How quick they are to use Marxist terminology whenever it
  comes to increasing super-profits for the big bosses in the ruling class! " 'They
  tend,' continued Hull, 'to become self-perpetuating bureaucracies. . . . Jobs that
  don't add value to the product are not needed.' "</p>

  <p>Petty bourgeois theoreticians have time and again attempted to draw a false analogy
  between a bureaucracy and a ruling class, insisting that both serve an identical
  function and therefore there's no real difference between them. This should be an eye
  opener to them. Bureaucracies in ancient slavery and in feudal times, from ancient Rome
  to ancient China, have always served as mere instruments of the ruling property-owning
  classes. These in their own way have sought to either augment or diminish the size,
  power and influence of the bureaucracy, but it has always served a different function
  than that of the ruling class.</p>

  <p>The ruling class under capitalism has historically served as the organizer of
  production, but the development of the productive forces, particularly the momentous
  dimension of the scientific-technological revolution, makes them superfluous.
  Centralized, collective, socialized production, which is what we have now, makes the
  ruling class wholly unnecessary. The process of production is now ready made for the
  working class. It only needs to overcome the gap between its objective position and the
  consciousness which is indispensable to harmonizing collective, centralized production
  with collective, centralized ownership by the workers.</p>
