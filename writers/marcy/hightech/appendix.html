  <h5>High Tech, Low Pay [Sam Marcy]</h5>
  <hr />

  <h1>Appendix</h1>

  <p>In 1984 the U.S. census issued a report on Sun Belt-Frost Belt migration which
  illustrates the point that no economic trend under capitalism is ever fully followed
  through to the very end. It shows that there has been a reversal in the consistent
  trend of heavy migration from the North and Middle Atlantic states to the South that
  had been especially prominent in the 1970s, but began two or three decades earlier.
  (See Table 6 in Appendix B.)</p>

  <p>These new findings were summarized in the <em>New York Times</em> of April 7, 1985,
  as follows: "(T)he migratory streams from the Northeast to the South and West are
  markedly shallower and narrower than they were five years ago, and the flow in the
  other direction is a bit wider and deeper."</p>

  <p>The oil boom of the 1970s significantly accelerated the rate of migration from the
  so-called Frost Belt to the Sun Belt. The artificial oil shortage created a period of
  high employment in the South as well as the West. Texas, Oklahoma, California and
  Florida in particular gained considerably from that trend. But the upswing soon turned
  into a vast speculative phase in the development of the capitalist economic cycle. Then
  came the failure of the Penn Square bank of Oklahoma in 1982 and the
  Continental-Illinois bank in 1984, and the economic upswing turned into a virtual
  collapse. Capitalist overproduction in oil produced an unprecedented glut which
  continues to this day; drilling was halted in many areas and bankruptcies followed.</p>

  <p>This was as true of Tulsa as of Houston, Dallas and part of the California area. The
  halt of drilling and marketing of oil resulted in the loss of jobs in many of the
  satellite industries that had developed as a result of the oil boom and now began to
  sink. What seemed to have been a huge labor shortage turned into a vast pool of
  unemployed, although it didn't reach the high level of unemployment in Detroit, New
  York, Pittsburgh, Chicago or Youngstown, Ohio.</p>

  <p>The result was a significant decline in the mass migration toward the Sun Belt. Of
  course, the population of the Sun Belt has continued to increase, but not necessarily
  because of migrations from the Midwest, Middle Atlantic states and Northeast. For one
  thing, the region has a higher birth rate, but also and much more important is the
  increase in undocumented workers, notwithstanding severe government repression. As we
  indicated in Chapter 2, the agricultural workers--Latin and Black, sharecroppers and
  farm laborers--are generally the backbone of the food industry in this country and the
  basis for the tremendous agricultural capacity of the U.S.</p>

  <p>Some of the bosses' reasons for migration to the Sun Belt were the right-to-work
  laws and a variety of other anti-union advantages to the industrialists, as well as
  lucrative racist practices in the South. This trend was facilitated over many decades
  by the increasing speed of transportation seen in the development of the automobile,
  the railroads and the airplane. The reversed trend in population shift cannot be fully
  accounted for by the collapse of the oil boom in the Sun Belt. The current reversal can
  only be more fully explained in terms of the continuing, relentless shift of capital to
  wherever even the momentary rate of profit is highest.</p>

  <p>The earlier flow of high technology to California and to some enclaves in the
  Southern states has now given way to a flow of capital back to the Northeast and some
  of the Mid-Atlantic states for the same reason which prompted it to flow into the Sun
  Belt in the first place: a significantly higher rate of profit.</p>

  <p>This recent trend in the population shift from the South to the North, as indicated
  by the charts and graphically shown by the 1984 Census Bureau statistics, is the result
  of one of those great "cooperative projects" between bankers, city governments, state
  legislatures and the industrialists to lure high tech. All too frequently this is done
  in the name of "getting jobs," but in reality it is an attempt by finance capital to
  once again flow into selected areas in the North and Mid-Atlantic states where the rate
  of profit has again become higher.</p>

  <p>It is common knowledge that New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Michigan and some of
  the Mid-Atlantic states and the area around Boston's Route 128 have been offering
  tremendous concessions in taxes and creating special conditions for high-tech
  industries, which live on low wages notwithstanding all the glow and glitter about
  spawning multi-millionaires. In the New York-New Jersey area especially, "enterprise
  zones" have been established which are calculated to lure industry away from other
  states by offering lower wage levels free from many restrictions. Long Island in
  particular has become notorious because the limited economic upturn there is based
  mostly on pirating industry from other states.</p>

  <p>States and cities now continually engage in a frantic bidding contest for industrial
  sites, all in the name of luring high technology. The setting up of "industrial parks"
  for a while creates excitement and an aura of coming prosperity, but ends up providing
  very low-paying jobs. It becomes a contest over which states and cities will offer the
  most anti-labor, pro-big business environment, in which prospective employers can
  expect to find docile, unorganized workers.</p>

  <p>The population shift as evidenced by the 1984 census projections is of a tentative
  character as yet. It has to be monitored by the trade union movement as well as by
  Black, Latin and women's organizations from the point of view of being an attempt to
  lower the wage patterns. These studies should not be left to bourgeois sociologists or
  to demographers appointed by the various arms of the capitalist government that are
  working hand-in-glove with big business in flagrant and utter disregard of what it does
  to the living standards of the masses.</p>

  <p>Population shifts also have to be viewed from the viewpoint of environmental impact,
  including the health and safety of the workers. It takes a heavy toll on men and women
  when in order to get work they must move to areas where housing, schools and recreation
  facilities are poor and/or inadequate.</p>

  <p>What the reversed trend from the Sun Belt to the Frost Belt confirms is that shifts
  in the population are determined by the general economic laws governing capitalist
  society. It is not demography alone which explains this shift in the population. That
  is a surface manifestation. Of course, some geographical areas are more hospitable than
  others, but that has prevailed since the formation of the planet. In analyzing
  population trends under the capitalist system, it is the economic laws of capitalist
  development that have to be taken into account first of all.</p>
