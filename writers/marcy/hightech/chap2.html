  <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

  <h1>The Scientific-Technological Revolution</h1>

  <h3>Technology and trade union tactics</h3>

  <p>An example from the distant past can be related to the present to help bring into
  focus the importance of technological revolutions in relation to the class
  struggle.</p>

  <p>In 1789 an Englishman named Samuel Slater, an inventor by profession, devised a
  secret design for a machine to make textiles. As a result of this machine it was
  possible to set up textile factories.</p>

  <p>British law at the time would not allow him to export the machine or to legally
  leave the country himself; if he were caught, he would be subject to imprisonment.
  That's how much importance was given to technology and its export at that time.</p>

  <p>However, posing as a farmer in order to evade the emigration law, Slater was able to
  secretly leave the country. He memorized the design so that he would have no documents
  with him in case of investigation. That's how Britain at that time guarded technology
  and that's how the early ruling class understood the significance of technology in its
  world struggle.</p>

  <p>That was almost two centuries ago. At present the struggle over high technology
  (that's what Slater's invention was at that time) has taken on an even more momentous
  aspect from the point of view of secrecy and the secret struggle within the
  bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>U.S. corporations have retained hundreds of spies abroad in order to garner the
  latest technological innovations while at the same time using the FBI as a virtual
  private army to track down their opponents, especially the Japanese.</p>

  <p>Where does this technological struggle, the constantly and continually growing
  technological revolution, leave the workers and the unions? What does it mean under
  present circumstances?</p>

  <p>What it has meant in the last few years is that the ruling class believes that the
  labor movement and the trade unions in particular are no longer necessary to the
  system. It sees the unions as an encumbrance, an obstacle in the way of further
  technological development.</p>

  <p>Even the bourgeois liberals no longer feel they need liberalism as such and hence
  have turned away from an alliance with the labor movement. Liberalism as an ideology is
  no longer essential to the predatory, avaricious multinational corporations in the
  struggle for high technology, which is, under the present social structure, absolutely
  in conflict with the working class.</p>

  <h3>Plant closings and high-tech obsolescence</h3>

  <p>In the early 1960s, consumer groups began a campaign designed to point out that a
  great variety of commodities were deliberately produced to have a shorter duration of
  usefulness than might be possible given the same manufacturing equipment and
  technological know-how.</p>

  <p>It was a case of planned obsolescence. Thus many products, ranging from home
  appliances to automobiles and even skyscrapers, were planned to endure for a shorter
  period than was necessary.</p>

  <p>The scope of the products to come under the umbrella of planned obsolescence was
  legion. However, this did not include the heavy industries, the machines which produce
  machines; in other words, the industrial structure.</p>

  <p>The Second World War, which caused so much destruction of human lives, also took a
  very heavy toll of property. Among the imperialist countries, it destroyed a
  considerable part of the infrastructure of Germany and Japan. Whole factories and
  buildings were bombed to the ground. This happened to a lesser extent in Britain and
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The U.S., as is well known, was free from military attack and its industrial
  structure remained intact. Initially, of course, this was a tremendous advantage at the
  end of the war. However, in order to rebuild Europe and also Japan, the U.S. spent a
  considerable amount of money and some equipment under the Marshall Plan to revitalize
  European industry. The Japanese also started to rebuild along these same lines.</p>

  <p>Since whole factories and industrial complexes had been destroyed, this gave a very
  important impetus to the development of high technology. In the U.S. the impetus for
  the development of high technology was almost immediately absorbed by the
  military-industrial complex, to the disadvantage of civilian industry.</p>

  <p>In some ways the capitalists in both West Germany and Japan, and to a much lesser
  degree Britain, were given the opportunity to build whole new plants based on
  up-to-date and state-of-the-art facilities. The very destruction that was supposed to
  have broken the back of the capitalist competition from Germany and Japan gradually was
  turned to a large extent into its opposite.</p>

  <p>High technology took off swiftly over there, particularly in Japan and then West
  Germany. Whereas earlier planned obsolescence had been applied mostly to means of
  consumption, from home appliances to construction materials and autos, it now took off
  and was applied to the industrial infrastructure, the plants themselves.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, the life cycle of the new heavy industry, including steel and auto
  plants, grew increasingly shorter than that of older facilities in the U.S.</p>

  <p>The life cycle of the technology in a steel plant by the standards of the 1950s and
  1960s was about 14 years, if not longer. However, by the late 1970s, the life cycle of
  a Japanese plant was about 8 or 9 years, while that of U.S. plants remained somewhere
  around 14.</p>

  <p>By virtue of the quantum jumps brought about by the application of computers and
  electronics, the very high-technology industrial units now last about two or three
  years before they become outdated by even more sophisticated technology, whose life
  cycle is even shorter. This process under the capitalist system is as ruthless as it is
  relentless.</p>

  <p>Any efforts to manage this technology so as not to reduce the workforce turn to nil.
  Trade unionists who represent the workers must take note of this tendency and know that
  it is of an international character; that the life cycles of all technologies
  continually get reduced. The process was much slower but just as pervasive even at the
  dawn of the capitalist system, when technology first began to be widely applied with
  the use of machinery, the industrial revolution and so on.</p>

  <p>High technology, especially in the era of computers and electronics, continues to
  take quantum jumps. A plant which just recently may have had ten years to go can now
  become obsolete as a result of the constant revolution of the means of production. The
  development of not only products and devices but of whole new technologies makes what
  otherwise would be a well-functioning, long-lasting plant with a stable workforce
  obsolete, but only in comparison to the new technologies.</p>

  <p>This is what lies at the root of what has become an epidemic of plant closings. In
  part it is due to the capitalist cycle of production. But while it takes on a more
  aggravated and epidemic character in capitalist recessions, this tendency prevails as a
  characteristic of capitalist development in so-called good times as well.</p>

  <p>Let's take a look at four fairly recent examples of changes introduced by the
  high-tech revolution and their effects upon the workers and the trade union movement.
  One deals with the communications industry, one with construction and earth-moving
  equipment, one with electronics, and one with automobiles. These four symbolize what is
  projected for industry in general, but is still in an anticipatory stage.</p>

  <h3>The end of the AT&amp;T myth</h3>

  <p>The AT&amp;T Systems Information Division announced in August 1985 that it would be
  eliminating 25,000 jobs at its various installations. This was the second major layoff
  at AT&amp;T in less than two years. The significance of this sharp retrenchment of the
  workforce goes far beyond its numbers. Yet even so, about one-fourth of the 120,000
  workers in the divisions involved have been laid off.</p>

  <p>Until just recently, AT&amp;T had a nearly absolute monopoly in its field of
  operations. It occupies a special place at the very summit of highly sophisticated
  technology.</p>

  <p>Before the 1970s AT&amp;T was regarded as relatively less sensitive to the
  vicissitudes of the capitalist economic cycle than other giant corporations. Jobs
  there, it used to be said, were much more secure than in other huge manufacturing
  companies or utilities. All the more has this unprecedented cutback come as a shock to
  many of AT&amp;T's apologists.</p>

  <p>It is a common error to believe that AT&amp;T's recent divestiture, in which it is
  supposed to have spun off for good its local telephone companies, was all the result of
  public pressure, that it was a case of the government responding to the needs of the
  people and that a federal judge by judicial intervention had robbed AT&amp;T of its
  monopoly status.</p>

  <p>Nothing of the sort. It was the swift changes in techno logical development, the
  revolution in electronics, microwave radio transmission, the need to develop satellite
  communications and the leap into the Space Age beginning with the Soviet Union's
  launching of Sputnik which laid the foundation for AT&amp;T's divestiture.</p>

  <p>The development of a multitude of new technologies ushered in with the Space Age
  made it incumbent upon AT&amp;T to look for a solution to its vast new problems by way
  of spinning off its local telephone companies over a period of time and utilizing the
  vast money thus derived to shield itself from other corporate competitors.</p>

  <p>The continued existence of the AT&amp;T monopoly in its old corporate framework was
  incompatible with the new revolutionary developments in technology. If it stayed the
  way it was, there would be a flight of capital away from AT&amp;T into the areas of the
  satellite sciences, radio microwave transmissions and electronic developments of all
  sorts, particularly those geared to Pentagon needs. Either AT&amp;T would have to begin
  the task of transforming itself or it would be outstripped by the newcomers outside its
  corporate framework.</p>

  <p>AT&amp;T is thus an illustrative example of how a giant corporation, no matter how
  huge, no matter how insulated it seems to be from the ravages of predatory capitalist
  competition, nevertheless ultimately either falls to the mainstream or becomes
  successfully dismembered by competing dynastic financial and industrial cliques.</p>

  <p>We see illustrated here what Marxism has always taught: that it is the development
  of the productive forces which changes the economic conditions. The ruling class
  politicians and judges who seem to have ordained the AT&amp;T breakup were merely
  responding to new economic conditions facing the ruling class.</p>

  <p>Capitalism never fully carries through any of its economic tendencies to the very
  end. This is remarkably illustrated by the tendency of capitalist competition to turn
  into monopoly. This tendency is never fully realized. While the general epoch is that
  of monopoly capitalism, contradictory trends in capitalist development have
  demonstrated that competition exists side by side with monopoly.</p>

  <p>In the last two decades some of the greatest monopolies, like AT&amp;T and others
  which seemed so monolithic and omnipotent, have all shown a tendency to break up and
  re-form again and again. This applies to the greatly exaggerated power and supposed
  monopoly of the OPEC countries, too. The dominant relationship between the oppressor
  and oppressed has never ceased for a moment to be a fundamental factor in the
  situation.</p>

  <p>The tendency to disintegrate, break up and re-form again and again is a
  characteristic feature in the struggle between competition and monopoly. Huge
  corporations turn into conglomerates, later spin off some of their divisions, and again
  break up and re-form. The underlying element in all this is that capital tends to flow
  to wherever the rate of profit is higher, but retreats as soon as the tendency toward
  lowering the profit rate makes itself evident.</p>

  <p>The divestiture of AT&amp;T and its deregulatory aspects are merely a reflection of
  what has been taking place in the anatomy of the capitalist economy resulting from the
  growth of the productive forces. The growth of the productive forces always upsets
  established relationships in the constellation of conflicting forces and groupings in
  the ruling class.</p>

  <p>The havoc AT&amp;T wreaked on the workers by unloosing such devastating cutbacks
  mirrors the general crisis which the high-technology establishments are experiencing.
  High technology was supposed to be if not altogether immune from unemployment, then at
  least only marginally affected. Now this myth has been thoroughly demolished. There are
  now severe cutbacks not only in high-technology companies like AT&amp;T but in all the
  semiconductor establishments as well.</p>

  <p>Mass layoffs have taken place all around Silicon Valley in California and there have
  been significant slowdowns in other high-tech regions of the country as well, such as
  in the Boston area around Route 128.</p>

  <p>This experience demonstrates how false is the notion that unemployment has been
  plaguing only the so-called Rust Belt in steel, mining, other metal industries and
  coal. One is supposed to forget that there has also been a tremendous erosion of jobs
  in textiles, housing, lumber and agriculture.</p>

  <p>Of all the arguments that have been advanced to embellish the so-called new
  information society, the most banal one is that it tends to increase the demand for
  more and more scientific personnel, that it requires more and more skilled workers, and
  that these together with management personnel constitute a base that is sheltered from
  the crisis of capitalism.</p>

  <p>It is true of course that some elements of the capitalist economy respond to
  capitalist economic stagnation and crisis earlier than others. But it is simply a
  matter of timing.</p>

  <p>What is afflicting AT&amp;T today will surely surface tomorrow in IBM. Moreover, it
  will make its way (if it has not already done so) into the broad service sector which
  has been indirectly fed by high technology in the first place.</p>

  <h3>Mass layoffs at Caterpillar</h3>

  <p>The Caterpillar Tractor Company is the world's largest producer of earthmoving
  equipment, which is mostly used in construction projects of all kinds, oil drilling and
  mining. In early December 1985, investment analysts praised Caterpillar for announcing
  plans to further reduce its workforce, which had already been cut from 90,000 in 1979
  to 53,000. The company wanted to lay off 10,000 additional workers over the next
  five-year period, while maintaining the same output.</p>

  <p>This posed a strategic problem for the unions involved. The Caterpillar workers had
  already gone through a six-month strike, and these big layoffs made such struggle even
  more difficult.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar's plans called for transforming the step-by-step assembly line system in
  its existing plants to a system where work is done in stages in various factory areas.
  These "factory cells," it is claimed, would speed production and lower costs through
  automated materials handling and processing. This plan is an example of a new
  manufacturing philosophy called "down-sizing" which also lends itself to more
  outsourcing of component parts.</p>

  <p>Another element to its $600 million automation program would focus on robotics and
  computer-aided manufacturing systems which would involve not only more automated
  materials handling, but also more robots in welding and foundry work.</p>

  <p>Such a drastic reduction in the workforce to less than half in only ten years, which
  evokes such praise from the banks and investment houses, is another prime example of
  what is in store for the workers. This profound transformation in manufacturing
  methods, which is still only in its early stages, will be felt by all the unions and
  indeed constitutes a classwide assault on all workers and oppressed people.</p>

  <p>It should also be noted that these layoffs came at the height of the so-called
  capitalist recovery, when the crisis was supposedly over and companies should have been
  rehiring. This is supposed to be the pickup in the economy brought about by the Reagan
  program. But if this was true, and these layoffs were occurring in a period of
  recovery, then what will happen in a downturn?</p>

  <p>The implications of this for overall trade union strategy are extremely serious, and
  demonstrate once again the need for new strategic conceptions.</p>

  <h3>The GE-RCA merger</h3>

  <p>As the largest non-oil merger ever, costing over $6 billion, the merger or
  acquisition of RCA Corporation by General Electric will have far-reaching effects on a
  global scale. It is especially important that the workers involved understand the
  significance of the merger historically and as part of a broad social process that goes
  beyond local or even national boundaries.</p>

  <p>By virtue of their vast facilities, often in other countries and not unionized,
  these corporate monsters have gained broad social, political and diplomatic leverage
  against single unions. These concentrations of capital are classwide organizations to
  which the workers in the unions have to develop a classwide perspective, nationally as
  well as internationally, in order to be able to get a firm handle on how to fight the
  companies.</p>

  <p>The unions have to both go beyond the strictly legalistic character of union
  contracts and go outside of the capitalist-labor property relations in order to be able
  to combat the corporations effectively. This is more important than it was 60 years
  ago, when both these giant companies were rapidly expanding the workforce. Now they are
  contracting it, a fact which is statistically undeniable.</p>

  <p>Even during the 1970s, GE reduced its U.S. employment by 25,000 and RCA cut its
  domestic workforce by 14,000.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1" name="ref1">1</a></sup> It
  is no answer that they increased employment abroad. That merely illustrates the
  continual flight of capital from one area to another, depending on both economic and
  political conditions, for capital will go wherever the rate of profits is highest at a
  particular moment.</p>

  <p>It is also not true to say that the flight of capital is from the Frost Belt of the
  U.S. to the Sun Belt, because statistics now show a flight of capital from the South
  back to the Northeast and the Midwest (see Appendix A). However, this is accompanied by
  higher technology and lower wages.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> The fact that there
  has been a certain upturn in the capitalist economy only emphasizes that when the
  downward cycle begins again, the process of dismantling these so-called new plants will
  become just as barbarous as it has been with the older ones.</p>

  <p>One of the many important lessons that can be learned from the GE-RCA merger is the
  need for the workers to establish vigilance committees, which can ferret out
  information in advance of mergers, acquisitions, layoffs and so on, in order to prepare
  the workers for sudden turnabouts by these predatory giants. Even greater is the
  necessity, even if only in embryonic form, for the absolutely indispensable education
  of the workers: the development of union consciousness into class consciousness, and
  with it an appreciation of international cooperation between all the workers.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, a truly classwide perspective in relation to such important mergers or
  acquisitions shows that, notwithstanding all the suffering they impose on the workers
  everywhere, the basic content of these developments is to lay the solid and
  indestructible foundation for socialism. The objective economic content of the
  scientific-technological revolution is that it socializes the labor process with
  virtually lightning speed, showing the ripeness and maturity for a socialist takeover
  by the workers of the means of production so they can be used for the benefit of
  humanity and not for private profit.</p>

  <p>This GE-RCA merger in particular has an economic and technological significance
  which could potentially have great social value in the struggle for socialism. GE and
  RCA may overlap, but they could be integrated so as to have great sociological
  importance. Their merger lays the material foundation for genuine socialist
  construction.</p>

  <p>In the old days, when a steel company bought an iron ore mine, constructed a
  railroad to transport its raw materials, or acquired coal mines, it became an
  integrated entity, and from the perspective of socialist construction was progressive.
  It organized production in such a way that workers' control would potentially be able
  to function more efficiently.</p>

  <p>It is an altogether different matter when a steel or other company buys a gambling
  casino, a racetrack, a tourist resort or other entities that are wholly unrelated to
  the development of its original specific purpose. This kind of buying and selling is
  for the sole purpose of garnering huge profits, particularly in a wildly speculative
  period which is characterized precisely by such deals.</p>

  <p>Many mergers are motivated solely for the purpose of manipulating the cash acquired
  from one of the corporations. In these cases, there is sometimes not the remotest
  connection between the productive processes of the companies involved. For that reason,
  there soon develop divestiture procedures or spin-offs, which happen when one of the
  corporations either is milked of its cash or puts up some of its valuable assets to be
  sold for cash. In the past, both RCA and GE have in this way spun off parts of their
  acquisitions acquired in other mergers.</p>

  <p>In the 1960s, a characteristic form of the concentration of capital was the
  conglomerate. A variety of different and unrelated businesses were absorbed into a
  consolidated company. The diversity of products thus brought under one corporate roof
  was believed to shelter the conglomerate from capitalist economic crisis.</p>

  <p>What made this attractive for a short period, however, was the fact that the 1960s
  was a time of relative capitalist stability and prosperity, due most of all to the Viet
  Nam war. Under these conditions, the unions did not perceive much of a threat to their
  position coming from the conglomerate trend.</p>

  <p>The buyouts and acquisitions of recent years, however, are quite different. Not only
  have they come in a more downward phase of the capitalist economic cycle, but the top
  priority of the cost reduction aspect of this newer concentration of capital is the
  elimination of jobs.</p>

  <p>All this brings into sharp focus the urgent need for the workers to be able to pass
  from rudimentary trade unionism, based on trade, plant or industry, to a classwide
  understanding of their key role in production.</p>

  <h3>Saturnization</h3>

  <p>Ever since the General Motors Corporation announced that it would build a new Saturn
  plant in Tennessee, and even before the actual site for the plant was chosen, there
  began a widely heralded and unprecedented publicity campaign that this would be the
  technological miracle of the latter half of the 20th century. Indeed, it is claimed
  that this type of plant will lay the basis for the U.S. to win the race in low-cost
  cars with the Japanese and other competitors.</p>

  <p>There are two aspects to this question: that of labor relations in the new plant,
  and the public presentation by the company of its technological and competitive
  significance from the viewpoint of efficiency and low-cost operation.</p>

  <p>How it will affect the workers is given secondary consideration in the capitalist
  press. What is stressed in most of the major capitalist newspapers and electronic media
  is that it will inaugurate a new era in labor-management relations, that indeed it will
  be the answer to what they call the fruitless confrontational aspects of the collective
  bargaining process, and that what will result from the UAW-GM agreement is a new spirit
  of cooperation. This is supposedly based on the new, more modern concept of involving
  the workers in decision making and of doing away with monotonous, repetitive and,
  needless to say, extremely arduous work by combining several operations.</p>

  <p>Outside of the UAW ranks themselves, the popular impression is that this will modify
  if not undermine the rigid division between the managerial staff and the workers. The
  workers themselves will have more of a say in what they do and what they produce.</p>

  <h3>View of UAW militants</h3>

  <p>Needless to say, the militant workers in the UAW immediately saw through all this. A
  summary of what was actually being proposed by the company was leaked to the press on
  July 9, 1985. It was analyzed by Jerry Goldberg in <em>Workers World</em>
  newspaper.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>

  <p>The contract not only set a base pay at about 80% of what workers at traditional
  plants will earn later in this decade, but the Saturn plant will operate with only one
  unskilled job classification and three to five skilled classifications. By contrast,
  traditional plants have as many as 100 classifications.</p>

  <p>The Saturn contract makes no room for work rules and lets management transfer
  workers more easily within the plants, allowing the company to eliminate many jobs. The
  <em>Workers World</em> report gives these details:</p>

  <p>"Pete Kelly, who is a member of the UAW International Executive Board, had this
  comment to make: 'Saturn at its core is a threat to the union.' The new agreement
  eliminates the union shop committee. There will be no union representatives on the shop
  floor to handle grievances and other worker problems. At Saturn a union-management
  consensus system will replace the shop committee.</p>

  <p>"The proposal eliminates seniority except for unusual circumstances when worker
  abilities are equal.</p>

  <p>"Under Saturn, all workers will be salaried. Raises for each individual will be
  based on meeting productivity, quality, production and attendance goals, as well as
  profit sharing. As Kelly correctly pointed out in objecting to those provisions, 'The
  union fought for 40 years to get rid of incentive pay.'</p>

  <p>"Supposed job security is a key element of the deal. Some 80% of the workforce will
  receive 'guaranteed employment' unless 'severe economic conditions' or 'catastrophic
  events' occur [in other words, a recession--S.M.]. The other 20% of the workers will be
  'associate members' who will not receive blanket protection from layoffs. 'That creates
  a second class of citizens in the UAW,' Kelly said.</p>

  <p>"For the past five years the union leadership has swallowed the company line that
  foreign imports represent the greatest problem facing the autoworkers. 'Buy American'
  is the UAW's main slogan. In taking this line the union leadership has accepted the
  company argument that to become competitive with the Japanese the companies must cut
  U.S. labor costs $2,000 per worker."</p>

  <p>There is no question that these terms are extraordinarily onerous and are a break
  with the UAW's traditional progressive stance over the many years the union has been in
  existence. However, at the time of this writing the agreement is only an executory
  contract. It will take many months if not a couple of years before the plant becomes
  operational, at which time the contract would go into effect.</p>

  <p>Thus, what the company and the labor officialdom propose, the workers may very well
  dispose. There's many a slip between the cup and the lip.</p>

  <h3>Another 'Ford revolution'?</h3>

  <p>The way the Saturn project has been presented as constituting a technological
  breakthrough has led many to anticipate nothing less than a second auto revolution,
  having effects as profound as those Ford introduced with the mass production
  concept.</p>

  <p>It is worthwhile examining this for the project is being presented to the public as
  a big boon. It is bound to create a tremendous number of jobs by the sheer volume of
  investment projected--$5 billion according to some estimates.</p>

  <p>It is said that the Ford Motor Company, by introducing new methods and a new
  concept, was able to create hundreds of thousands of jobs which ultimately made work
  for millions. Is it not possible that the Saturn project could result in similar
  accomplishments with another radical departure from the accepted norms in labor
  relations and production techniques?</p>

  <p>Let us see.</p>

  <p>What was the essence of the Ford Motor Company's concept and technique? It
  introduced mass production. It brought a new principle into the production process.</p>

  <p>There's no new principle in the Saturn project, an analysis shows. Henry Ford's mass
  production methods were based on two general ideas: 1) division and specialization and
  2) the use of tools and machines in the production of standard, interchangeable parts.
  The total production operation was carefully divided into specialized tasks made up of
  relatively simple, highly repetitive motion patterns and the minimum handling or
  positioning of the workpiece.</p>

  <p>This permitted the development of human motion patterns that were easily learned and
  rapidly performed. The simplification and standardization of component parts permitted
  large production runs of parts which were readily fitted without adjustment.</p>

  <p>Smaller tasks and more finely delimited methods reduced the variability in
  technique. The worker became more removed from responsibility and the authority to
  integrate his or her task was left to others.</p>

  <p>The assembly line epitomizes the whole Ford concept and practice. There's no need to
  go into the exhaustion, boredom, hazards and hardships of the assembly line. That
  should be well known. But the Ford revolution also had a progressive social aspect to
  it.</p>

  <p>The Ford introduction of mass production, what amounted to micro-division of labor
  in the plants, dramatically reduced the cost of a motor vehicle and was followed by a
  vast expansion of employment. Ford was also able to pay the highest wages and
  introduced the five-day week.</p>

  <p>Because the Ford concept enabled the production of many millions of vehicles, it
  fostered and cultivated the growth of satellite industries and generally constituted a
  significant contribution to capitalist production in the U.S.</p>

  <p>It was on that basis that the Ford Motor Company until the late 1930s was preeminent
  in the auto field on a world scale. It became a tremendous multinational corporation
  with its own sources of raw materials and so on.</p>

  <p>The Ford method and concept therefore led to an expansion of capitalist production.
  The Saturn project, however, is based on a contraction of the existing workforce.</p>

  <p>The Ford concept and strategy resulted in wiping out the old craft unions to a large
  extent. The problems that skilled workers had in the early days are documented in the
  struggles of the Mechanics Educational League, which was an organized expression of the
  skilled trades in the auto industry. It later dissolved and became the skilled crafts
  part of the UAW.</p>

  <p>The Saturn project is still in the planning stage, is only an executory contract
  which still has to be put into effect. The intention, however, is to wipe out as many
  as 100 job classifications. Even if only half that is consummated, it will amount to a
  vast contraction, in other words, the opposite of what happened in the earlier Ford
  concept.</p>

  <p>The concept behind the Saturn project is calculated to undermine the older,
  standardized, minutely calculated micro-division of labor and supplant it with multiple
  operations by workers, who it is claimed will be working together with more cooperative
  methods.</p>

  <p>Of course, cooperation and division of labor are not specifically capitalist aspects
  of production. Division of labor has existed over the ages, and so has cooperation.
  This was so even in ancient times, long before the dawn of the modern age. The Egyptian
  pyramids were built on the basis of division of labor and cooperation. It is impossible
  to conceive of any production not having some degree of division of labor and
  cooperation.</p>

  <p>What makes the Saturn project different from early forms of cooperation and division
  of labor is that it is done on a specifically capitalist basis, the aim of which is the
  chase after profits based on commodity production.</p>

  <p>It remains to be seen in what respects the Saturn production concept will differ
  from the old Ford-GM method. A great deal is being said about how the introduction of
  sophisticated and even exotic technology will do incredible things, of how intelligent
  workers cooperating in groups will have renewed pride in their work, and that this will
  result in a better car.</p>

  <p>Some of this is sheer propaganda by the company. But won't the new technology be so
  effective that it produces an even greater number of vehicles at lower cost? Wouldn't a
  new technology superior to that of the Japanese, Germans or Koreans help close the gap
  with them?</p>

  <h3>The GM-Hughes merger and military technology</h3>

  <p>The truth of the matter is that GM is relying not so much on new technological
  inventions and scientific developments from its own laboratories and science centers as
  on the transfer of technology from its acquisition of the Hughes Aircraft
  Corporation.</p>

  <p>What is involved in the GM-Hughes merger is a very deep and profound shift of the
  civilian industry toward the military-industrial complex. It strengthens the hand of
  the Pentagon in its long-standing attempt to become the central organizer of the
  capitalist economy.</p>

  <p>Up until the day of this acquisition, General Motors was the number one civilian
  producer in the country--the largest auto manufacturer and the largest complex of
  industrial facilities. As of June 1985, it became not just the number one auto producer
  but the number one defense electronics company as well.</p>

  <p>By merging with or buying out Hughes Aircraft, General Motors became inextricably
  bound up with the production of missiles, satellites, radar, surveillance, guidance and
  other military products. It thus became integrated with the military establishment on a
  really large scale.</p>

  <p>While before this buyout defense contracts were only 1% to 1-1/2% of GM's gross
  production, it is now estimated they will make up more than 6%. More important than the
  percentages, however, is the direction of this development. It is a qualitatively
  different kind of merger. It marks a giant leap of civilian industry into the arms of
  the military-industrial complex.</p>

  <p>Even though General Motors is so huge in comparison to Hughes Aircraft, one must
  reckon with the fact that it is not Hughes (that is, an individual giant corporation)
  which will exercise influence over General Motors. That would be absurd. Rather, it is
  the Pentagon, which has at its disposal hundreds of billions of dollars and therefore
  towers over any corporation, including GM.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the Ford Motor Company has also become involved in military
  production. This will compel more and more civilian producers to follow the trend. It
  is part and parcel of the Pentagon's effort to militarize U.S. industry.</p>

  <p>For a long time the auto industry, in particular, was viewed by a variety of liberal
  thinkers concerned with the struggle against imperialist war as a mainstay for peaceful
  coexistence with the USSR and other socialist countries and as a brake on the Pentagon.
  This was regarded as the material basis for the existence of a moderate grouping within
  the bourgeoisie, with economic roots in the civilian sector. This merger comes as a
  severe blow to this view.</p>

  <p>However, it is part of a longer-term trend. The principal motivation for the
  GM-Hughes merger and its most immediate basis can be directly traced to the Star Wars
  project, which has been pushed so feverishly by the Reagan administration. It is
  important to take into account this extremely significant political development, which
  gave the final stimulus to the GM-Hughes merger.</p>

  <p>In this "most open of open societies," the most important economic and political
  processes are carried out in secret. Only when they are completed are they brought out
  into the open as an accomplished fact. The GM-Hughes merger was a textbook example of
  this.</p>

  <p>This extraordinary development could not have been achieved without undercover
  cooperation among the holy trinity--high industry, finance and the government. What its
  effect will be on the auto workers and the Hughes workers remains to be seen. It most
  certainly will entail layoffs for many thousands sooner or later.</p>

  <p>It shows how the most important decisions governing the direction of the economy and
  affecting millions of people are decided by a handful of business executives who are
  not elected by the people and who are not even subject to veto by the government.</p>

  <p>We know now that the deal between Hughes and GM was long in the making. But it is
  the political process that gave it such a huge lift. Once the appropriations process in
  the Star Wars scheme was terminated with the presidential signature, the Pentagon
  opened up the process of bidding for research and development. Then began an explosive
  scramble by all the elements of the military-industrial complex to grab whatever they
  could of these most luscious contracts, where super-profits are most extravagant.</p>

  <p>It must be understood that we are dealing not with a "few" billion dollars worth of
  military contracts, but with hundreds of billions. Such is the dimension of the Star
  Wars project. No large corporation, not even such an enormous one as General Motors,
  could stand outside the orbit of this magnetic attraction for super-profits.</p>

  <p>Aside from anything else, this merger illustrates how utterly hypocritical are the
  assertions of giant corporations like GM that they are opposed to the government having
  a hand in private enterprise, that they are against bail-outs or government assistance
  or involvement. Certainly GM has been the loudest in proclaiming its independence of
  the government. Now it is completely intertwined with it.</p>

  <p>This deal is so enormous that it certainly warrants being used for more than the
  transfer of technology. More important for General Motors at the moment is that, in
  purchasing Hughes Aircraft, it enhances its profitability, precisely because Hughes is
  a huge prime military contractor.</p>

  <p>In fact, a formidable problem arises when the deal is viewed as a source for the
  transfer of technology from aerospace to auto manufacturing, as the company has
  claimed. The transfer of military technology on a mass scale to civilian auto
  production in particular may present insurmountable problems, at least for a
  considerable period of time, if the aim of reducing the cost per vehicle is taken into
  account.</p>

  <p>Experience has shown that the transfer of military technology to civilian
  production, on the basis of production for profit, has brought about enormous problems.
  Several examples come to mind that are detailed in Seymour Melman's book <em>Profits
  Without Production.</em><sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>

  <p>"Until now," says Melman, "no major military-serving enterprise has demonstrated an
  autonomous ability to carry out the sort of occupational switch that is needed to go
  civilian."</p>

  <p>Conversion means changing over the physical resources, the skills of all workers and
  the ways of organizing work to serve civilian rather than military goals. "Organization
  [of a conversion] is a problem area because of certain characteristics of military
  industry. The decision goals and occupational practices of [military] industry
  encourage cost escalation. Cost maximizing is feasible because subsidies from the
  federal government offset extraordinary increases."</p>

  <p>Hughes Aircraft is not the exception to this, but the rule. The government's largess
  to Hughes Aircraft is well known, as it is with other military contractors.</p>

  <p>"Military products are often designed to increase military 'capability' regardless
  of cost," says Melman. "Given that priority, reliability takes second place, as do such
  considerations as ease of maintenance and minimum cost for accomplishing a given
  function."</p>

  <p>Melman gives two well-known examples of military industry contractors who attempted
  to change over part of their production facilities and even labor force to civilian
  work: the Rohr Corporation of Chula Vista, Calif., and Boeing-Vertol, a division of
  Boeing Company.</p>

  <p>Rohr built the cars for BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) in San Francisco, as well as
  for the Washington, D.C., subway system. Boeing built the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay
  Transportation Authority) buses. In both cases the costs were enormous. The systems
  didn't work well and took long years for proper operation. There were frequent vehicle
  derailments, malfunctioning of the air conditioning system, cooling motors and fans
  when the motors burned out too quickly, and so on.</p>

  <p>There is another recent example of the difficulty created when technology developed
  by military contractors is used for civilian purposes. In the New York City area,
  Grumman buses, like those of the MBTA in Massachusetts, soon became notorious for
  improper functioning, compelling the city to sue the company.</p>

  <p>When GM announced the acquisition of Hughes, the capitalist press mentioned here and
  there the difficulties that might be incurred because of the different "lifestyles" of
  the two companies. But none mentioned the real problem: how to transfer the exorbitant
  costs of maximized technology to civilian production, where the objective is to produce
  a low-cost competitive vehicle.</p>

  <p>As a Pentagon protege, Hughes, like the other principal prime military
  contractors--General Dynamics, Boeing, and Rockwell to name a few--is not concerned
  with minimizing costs but with maximizing them. Therefore, when its military technology
  is transferred to civilian production, the burden of this cost will first be put on the
  workers in the Saturn plant. We thus see that the new technology is bound to be far
  more costly and that the workers will have to pay for it.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the auto industry historically is the one last area where civilian
  competition has existed on a wide international basis. These new technologies, whose
  shorter life cycles add more to the costs, spur on the tendency toward conversion to
  military production.</p>

  <p>This is what Saturnization means.</p>

  <h3>Military reorganization of the economy</h3>

  <p>Aside from the profit motive involved, where does the steam come from for all this?
  Who pushes the scientific-technological revolution at such a feverish pace? The AFL-CIO
  report discussed in Chapter 1 makes no mention of it, but automation, workerless
  factories, and all the rest are being pushed vigorously by the Pentagon. The Star Wars
  program is the prime example of and an outgrowth of this phenomenon.</p>

  <p>Right after AT&amp;T announced its imminent layoff of tens of thousands of workers,
  a company spokesman said it was now ready to forge ahead with Star Wars research. "Can
  computer software handle anything Star Wars throws at them?" was the question posed by
  members of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic and Theater Nuclear
  Forces. "I believe the answer is yes," replied Solomon Buchsbaum of AT&amp;T Bell
  Laboratories.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></p>

  <p>The Pentagon since before 1983 has been attempting to make a quantum leap into an
  area which was previously regarded, at least in peace time, as off-limits. It is
  attempting to become the central organizer, not merely of the war industries, but of
  the capitalist economy as a whole.</p>

  <p>The term "centrally organized economy" has generally been applied by bourgeois
  economists only to socialist countries. The very term has been anathema to big
  business. For decades bourgeois economic dogma has held onto the fiction that in the
  U.S. individual corporate enterprises are dominant; that "free enterprise" and
  capitalist competition reign supreme; and that it was only the Rooseveltian New Dealers
  and their latter-day administrators of the capitalist state who injected the government
  into what is normally regarded as the private sector.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter, however, is that monopoly capitalism in the U.S. has been
  steadily and relentlessly fusing with the capitalist state for decades, and is
  intertwined with the military in a thousand and one ways.</p>

  <p>It was General Eisenhower who coined the term "military-industrial complex" to
  describe the infrastructure that was set up during World War II and that was never
  really demobilized after the war. What is now contemplated by the Pentagon is not
  merely adding to the existing structure, which has expanded enormously over the years,
  but creating a new concept altogether. It envisions the organization of the basic
  elements of the capitalist economy under the aegis of the Pentagon in so-called peace
  time.</p>

  <p>There is a struggle, a virtual war, going on over whether and how to do this. A
  glimpse of this was aired in 1983, on a special segment of the PBS program "Frontline"
  entitled "Pentagon Inc."<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup></p>

  <p>The program dealt with the existence of a little-known group that has tremendous
  power and authority. It is called the Manufacturing Technology Advisory Group (MTAG)
  and it includes representatives of both the military and the principal defense
  contractors. The ambition of this group is to become the MITI of the United States.
  (MITI is the ministry set up by the Japanese capitalist government which is said to
  direct the goals of the Japanese economy.)</p>

  <p>Air Force General Bernard Weiss explained how the military views MTAG: "To me," said
  Weiss to a meeting of MTAG that included many military contractors, "I look upon all of
  us here today in your organizations that you work for as the MITI that will take the
  U.S. out of the position that it's in today in productivity and quality and move it
  back to being preeminent in this world."</p>

  <p>Now, that requires a considerable reorientation of U.S. industry and commerce. It
  means that this group would, in the words of the PBS narrator, "set the direction for
  our industrial future. They make up an economic apparatus every bit as rich and
  elaborate as MITI. But it is the military here controlling the money and the goals are
  set by military men."</p>

  <p>In Japan, of course, only a very small percent of its gross national product is
  involved in military research and development as against the huge expenditures in the
  U.S.</p>

  <p>Another speaker at the MTAG meeting shown on PBS was a General Skantze, whose title
  "Head of Manufacturing Command" was not explained, nor were his job classification and
  scope of authority.</p>

  <p>General Skantze was more specific than General Weiss. "Since our war-fighting
  equipment comes from the industrial base," he said, "the condition within that base
  must be addressed and corrected. We now have an effort underway to provide a
  <strong>planning system that will guide our industrial base investments</strong> and
  will eventually integrate technology, opportunity and business investment planning. It
  is a top-down approach we call 'Industrial Base Planning.' " (Our emphasis.)</p>

  <p>"We plan to maximize application of mechanization and automation," he continued,
  "and we plan a paper-free factory with planning, scheduling and control by the latest
  computer hardware and software techniques. We thus expect a factory that can perform at
  least one full shift per day unmanned."</p>

  <p>What all this signifies is that the Pentagon is aiming at capitalist regimentation
  of industry, high-technology industries in particular, and the capitalist economy in
  general. The whole purpose of it, the Pentagon made clear through these spokesmen, is
  not to coordinate and plan for useful, cooperative production for the people. It is, as
  they make very plain, to compete not only with Japan but the whole world, militarily
  and economically.</p>

  <p>Planning while retaining the ownership in the private hands of the capitalist class
  and having the Pentagon as the central planner is the very opposite of the centrally
  planned economies in the USSR, China and other socialist countries.</p>

  <p>There production is planned for use. Here, as the generals make very clear, the
  planning is to strengthen competition, which leads to struggles abroad, intensifies
  antagonisms among the capitalist cliques here, and above all lays the basis for not a
  capitalist boom but for an even more devastating capitalist crisis, which the brass
  think they can contain through military regimentation.</p>

  <p>Mussolini, Hitter and Tojo thought so too. They did not succeed very well, as we all
  know. Neither will the Pentagon.</p>

  <p>It was a frequent theme in the middle 1950s, that is, between the Korean and Viet
  Nam wars, that because of the Pentagon's enormous power to maximize costs and its
  authority to hand out lavish and extravagant contracts for defense orders, the
  capitalist state thereby acquires the ability to abolish capitalist economic crises
  altogether.</p>

  <p>Of course it is all too true that the capitalist state can accelerate military
  contracts and thereby temporarily stave off an economic crisis. But it is also all too
  clear that when that fails, they resort to military adventures. In fact, the 20th
  century is full of examples of militarism giving a temporary respite to the capitalist
  system, only to later bring on a deeper and more profound economic crisis.</p>

  <p>In fact, there is no scientific basis for the view that militarization of the
  economy can avoid capitalist crises. The capitalist state is only the
  <strong>collective</strong> organizer on behalf of the individual capitalists. Insofar
  as its economic function is concerned, it appropriates an additional portion of surplus
  value or unpaid labor from the workers above and beyond what the individual capitalists
  have the power to extract. It thus intensifies the exploitation of the workers by the
  capitalists, adding more burdens as a result of its political role, including that of
  collecting taxes, and its special role as a repressive instrument against the working
  class and oppressed people. None of what the Pentagon and the capitalist state do
  alters the fundamental relations between the classes.</p>

  <p>The whole purpose of the capitalist state is to enhance the accumulation of capital.
  But the biggest obstruction to abolishing capitalist crisis is capital itself and the
  private ownership of the means of production. However the capitalist state may seek to
  intervene in the organization of the economy, it leaves unaltered the fundamental
  relation of exploitation. And it is this which generates the chaos and anarchy in
  capitalist production.</p>

  <p>Liberal thinkers are often blinded by what appears to be the omnipotence of the
  capitalist state because of its power of repression. But while it has tinkered with the
  economic laws of motion governing capitalist society, it has been unable to alter them
  in a way that would purge the system of crisis. It only succeeds in delaying the
  crisis, which is then even more disastrous when it comes.</p>

  <h3>The crisis in agriculture</h3>

  <p>The very acute agricultural crisis the U.S. is experiencing at the present time,
  which is deeper and more profound than any other crisis in agriculture since the early
  thirties, is not merely the result of capitalist over production. Contrary to
  widespread popular misconception, it is also very much the product of the
  scientific-technological revolution. Some aspects of this began well over a decade
  ago.</p>

  <p>"Agriculture's preoccupation with scientific and business efficiency has produced a
  radical restructuring of rural America and consequently of urban America," wrote Jim
  Hightower, a former USDA official, in his book <em>Hard Tomatoes, Hard
  Times.</em><sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> "There has been more than a green revolution
  out there. In the last 30 years there literally has been a social and economic upheaval
  in the American countryside. It is a protracted, violent revolution and it continues
  today."</p>

  <p>This revolution, says Hightower, has been fueled by "funds to the land grant college
  complex" which "has been the scientific and intellectual progenitor of that
  revolution."</p>

  <p>Hightower quotes the <em>Des Moines Register</em> to show that the land grant
  universities have devoted "the overwhelming portion of their research and educational
  funds to the promotion of agricultural technology in the service of the highest income
  farmers and bypassed poor farmers and rural communities."</p>

  <p>Thus, the huge profits go to large corporate enterprises, particularly the huge
  corporate farms and ranches, what Hightower calls the "vertically integrated and
  conglomerate corporations," which own "the seed, feed, chemical, credit, machinery and
  other 'input' industries and the processing, packaging, marketing, distributing,
  retailing, exporting and other 'output' industries.</p>

  <p>"Increasingly, agricultural production is vertically integrated. The markets are
  concentrated and dinners are prepackaged by corporate America. ITT serves up Gwaltney
  ham and Wonder bread. The turkey comes from Greyhound Corp.'s Armour division. Dow
  Chemical brings the lettuce, while Tenneco provides fresh fruits. Count on Boeing for
  the potatoes and American Brands for Mott's apple sauce. Coca-Cola serves orange juice,
  and for dessert there are strawberries from Purex.</p>

  <p>"Ralston Purina, Del Monte, Tropicana and Safeway are taking control of agricultural
  production, reducing farm laborers to contract laborers. Commodity after commodity is
  being groomed under vertically integrated contract, including 95% of the broilers, 75%
  of processed vegetables, 70% of citrus, 55% of turkeys, 40% of potatoes and 33% of
  fresh vegetables.</p>

  <p>"These percentages," the author adds, "are increasing every day."</p>

  <p>Every lever in this scientific-technological revolution in agriculture is controlled
  by the same industrial and financial plutocracy which is so well known for its
  stranglehold on industry in general. While it has been regarded in the past as divorced
  from agriculture, in reality it has absorbed most of the agricultural sector.</p>

  <p>Two articles written more than a decade later have verified this trend. The first
  was in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and proclaimed that "U.S. agriculture is in the
  midst of a radical restructuring. Middle-sized farms are vanishing; the growers are
  going high-tech; some sectors are robust and developing, some are sickly and dying.
  None are what they used to be."<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup></p>

  <p>"Medium-sized farms," continued the Journal, "generally defined as having $40,000 to
  $100,000 in annual sales, are shaping up as big losers. Large enough to be awash in
  debt but too small for the maximum in technology and efficiency, such farms are
  increasingly being squeezed out of business.</p>

  <p>"Snapping up much of their land are bigger, more efficient operators. About 12% of
  U.S. farmers now account for 63% of farm sales. The largest farms, those with sales
  over $250,000, rose 54% in number from 1978 to 1982."</p>

  <p>The article cited a bank economist from the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, a
  constituent part of the national Federal Reserve Bank, who gave his judgment on the
  course of the agricultural crisis and the scientific-technological revolution: "We will
  see a greater and greater concentration of the assets of agriculture in fewer and fewer
  hands."</p>

  <p>A continuation of this trend was reported in another article more than a year later
  in <em>USA Today.</em><sup><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> It cited a January 9, 1986, Census
  Bureau report that "more people left U.S. farms in 1985 than in any year since 1976,
  bringing U.S. farm population to its lowest level ever. The report comes at a time of
  crisis in U.S. agriculture. The Census Bureau said 399,000 left farms in 1985--bringing
  the percentage of farmers in the population to an all-time low of 2.2%. The departures
  are mostly younger families forced out because of economic adversity, forcing them to
  sell off or go out of business. The farm population peaked at 33% in 1916, but dropped
  steadily until the late 1970s. Other reasons are declining birthrates, aging farmers
  and technological changes."</p>

  <p>In a general way, everything said in these two articles is correct. However, they
  obscure what is truly fundamental and crucial for an understanding of agriculture in
  the U.S. in general and the agricultural crisis in particular. This is especially true
  of the way the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) gathers and reports data.</p>

  <p>They leave out of consideration the basic characteristic of capitalism in
  agriculture: the private ownership of land and its relationship to <strong>wage
  labor.</strong> This omission is of critical importance. Reading these two articles as
  well as much of the general literature on farming, one gets the impression that the
  fundamental factor in U.S. agriculture is the so-called independent, individual
  property-owning farmer. This leaves totally out of consideration the vast and often
  uncounted agricultural workers, the wage earners--some of whose wages are so meager
  they can scarcely be called that.</p>

  <p>The other fallacy in much of the popular literature on the agricultural crisis is to
  divide farms into large and small depending on acreage. This leaves out of
  consideration that a farm may be relatively small in terms of the number of acres but
  have great intensity in the application of capital, machinery and high technology. It
  may also employ huge numbers of agricultural workers. There are many such farms spread
  throughout the length and breadth of the country, from California to Florida, Arizona
  to New Jersey and all the way up to Maine and the state of Washington.</p>

  <p>Since its dawn, the capitalist system has been characterized by a sharp contrast
  between town and country, between rural and urban life, between the workers on the land
  and those in the factories. While the scientific-technological revolution has done much
  to blunt this grave contradiction, it has at the same time sharpened the contradiction
  between the working class as a whole, including agricultural workers, and the
  capitalist class.</p>

  <p>Unity and solidarity between those who work under the sun and those who work under
  the factory roof are more urgently needed than ever. A great deal of attention
  especially needs to be paid to putting the so-called "illegal," migrant workers within
  the framework of the organized trade union movement, which such organizations as the
  United Farm Workers (UFW) and the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) have set out
  to do.</p>

  <p>Writing more than 70 years ago on the development of capitalism in agriculture in
  the U.S., Lenin wrote: "Hired labor is the chief sign and indicator of capitalism in
  agriculture."<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> How striking this is, considering that
  even today in the U.S., the movies, television, literature and songs dwell on the
  family farm, leaving the wage laborer largely invisible!</p>

  <p>"The development of hired labor, like the growing use of machinery," said Lenin
  about the U.S., "is evident in <strong>all</strong> parts of the country, and in every
  branch of agriculture."</p>

  <p>In his painstaking study and statistical analysis of agriculture in the U.S., Lenin
  pointed out that in the 1910 U.S. census, all the farms were divided according to
  areas, just as had been done in the 1900 census. But unlike that earlier census, the
  one in 1910 did not divide the employment of hired labor according to the same
  classifications. Thus, wrote Lenin, "we are deprived of the opportunity of comparing
  the small and large area farms according to the number of hired laborers they
  employ."</p>

  <p>The effort continues to hide the significance of wage labor. Little attention is
  paid to the special exploitation of the agricultural worker, who more often than not is
  a migrant worker. Many are Black, the legacy of the sharecropping and tenant farming to
  which Lenin gave considerable attention in his study. Perhaps the majority, however,
  are so-called "illegal" immigrants from Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.
  "Illegal workers make up an estimated 50 to 70% of the nation's migrant workforce on
  the farms," according to the <em>Wall Street Journal.</em><sup><a href=
  "#fn11">11</a></sup></p>

  <p>Unless the agricultural crisis and more specifically the scientific-technological
  revolution in agriculture is put in the context of the capital-labor relation, as we
  did earlier, one gets a completely distorted viewpoint, not only of the current
  agricultural crisis, but of the nature of capitalist agriculture in general.</p>

  <p>Agriculture is now experiencing the same phenomenon observed in industry generally,
  where high technology is displacing workers and the substitution of lower-paid for
  higher-paid jobs is taking place. There has been a proportionate loss of jobs by
  comparison with previous periods. As Table 1 (see Appendix B), taken from the study
  series on "The Underbelly of the U.S. Economy" shows, "employment among farm workers
  (including farmers and farm managers, farm laborers and supervisors) declined in actual
  numbers from 4.2 million in 1964 to 3.1 million in 1974. From 1979 to 1982, the number
  declined by 15,000 to 2.7 million. Thus farm workers have declined as a percentage of
  total employment from 6.1% in 1964 to 2.7% in 1982. After 1982, the BLS no longer
  reported on this category of worker. [Not much has changed since Lenin!--S.M.] Overall
  employment in agriculture, however, has continued to decline from 3.4 million in 1982
  to 3.3 million in 1984."<sup><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup></p>

  <p>The scientific-technological revolution in agriculture should also be seen against
  the historical background of the centuries-long struggle to maintain the family farm,
  owned by the individual proprietor, free from the onslaught of capitalist development.
  The Homestead Act, passed in 1862 by the U.S. Congress, provided for the transfer of
  160 acres of unoccupied public land to each homesteader on payment of a nominal fee.
  This was to fortify and strengthen the individual farmer in the face of the onrushing
  development of capitalist accumulation in industry. It was supposed to be a shelter
  against the big landgrabbers, the industrial and real estate magnates, the railroads.
  (Of course, all this was done with no regard for the sovereign rights of the Native
  peoples.)</p>

  <p>But as Marx explained long ago, and as Lenin was to repeat many times, capital
  subordinates to itself all the varied forms of land tenure and reorganizes them in
  accordance with its needs, not the needs of the individual owner. Marx in
  <em>Capital</em> analyzed the extremely varied forms of land ownership, such as feudal,
  clan, communal, and state forms, and demonstrated how each in its own time became
  subjugated to the concentration of capital in the hands of a few and stronger
  capitalists. In the present monopoly stage of capitalist development, the historical
  mission of the scientific-technological revolution resulting from the law of capitalist
  accumulation is to facilitate the socialization of agriculture in the same way it has
  socialized industry, that is, while at the same time retaining the private ownership of
  the means of production, which is in irreconcilable contradiction to the social
  character of production.</p>

  <p>What role does the state play in this? The capitalist state tries to counteract the
  effects of large-scale production, which becomes ever more concentrated as a result of
  the scientific-technological revolution. The state does this by intervening on behalf
  of the capitalists while giving the appearance of continuing to enhance the socializing
  trend of capitalist industry. It takes over an increasing number of bankrupt
  enterprises, especially the huge ones, and bails them out as was done with the Chrysler
  Corporation and with Continental Illinois Bank and hundreds of smaller banks.</p>

  <p>Even the Reagan administration has allotted billions in subsidies to agriculture,
  the purpose of which is frankly stated: to strengthen the "viable enterprises," meaning
  the huge monopolist agribusiness corporate owners and controllers, and to facilitate
  the death of the smaller ones. On the other hand, the capitalist state has been forced
  all over the imperialist world to disgorge a great deal of what it formerly
  nationalized or subsidized and return it to the individual capitalists. This is done as
  a means of strengthening and intensifying capitalist exploitation over the workers and
  opening up new avenues of exploitation, especially in the oppressed countries, under
  the aegis of the strongest and most powerful multinational corporations.</p>

  <p>Nationalization, denationalization and deregulation are all functions of the
  capitalist state as an oppressor and exploiter. These tendencies transcend conservative
  and liberal administrations, reactionaries and progressives, so-called socialist
  administrations as in France, Spain and Greece, so-called Labor governments as in
  Britain, Norway, Sweden and Belgium and blatant, unrestrained reactionaries like the
  Reagan administration.</p>

  <p>It is instructive to compare the way the bourgeoisie has lamented over the
  collectivization (socialization) of agriculture in the USSR, China, and other socialist
  countries, especially the so-called forced collectivization, and contrast it with how
  they have welcomed the capitalist "collectivization" of farming communities here, which
  is done with much cruelty and is so remorseless and relentless. The apologists for the
  capitalist monopolies find only the highest praise for this kind of collectivization or
  socialization. It is progress. It is the future.</p>

  <p>But viewed in another light, viewed from a revolutionary perspective, this trend has
  laid the objective basis for socialism. Seen over a longer period, it has facilitated
  the task that the workers will have of reconstructing society. Decaying capitalism,
  with its perennial economic crises of capitalist overproduction, its billions upon
  billions of bushels of "surplus" corn, wheat, soybeans, etc., can find no better
  solution than to foreclose farms, making agricultural communities more destitute and
  compelling rural people to flee to the cities to increase the vast pool of the
  unemployed. As the article in <em>USA Today</em> showed, they are leaving the farms in
  droves, at a rate of close to 400,000 a year in 1985. They will become more and more
  integrated with the working class.</p>
