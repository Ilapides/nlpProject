  <h3>Chapter 8</h3>

  <h1>Defensive Trade Union Strategies</h1>

  <h3>Difference between a workers' party and a trade union</h3>

  <p>What is the fundamental difference between a workers' party and a trade union? Of
  course, every party member in a union has a duty to work with all other progressive
  unionists and try to improve the wages and living conditions of the workers. It's true
  that party members can be distinguished by their militancy, aggressiveness,
  determination and the enormous energy they expend with other workers in the struggle
  against the bosses. These alone, however, are not what distinguish a party member in
  the trade unions.</p>

  <p>The politically conscious worker must also attempt to educate the other workers in
  the spirit of the class struggle and promote the socialist goal. This goal is not an
  ideal as such. The socialist perspective is not something that is a matter of faith in
  the sense that someone holds some religious or political concept that is dear to
  them.</p>

  <p>The ordinary worker is taught that his or her objective in the union as a worker
  should be confined to fighting for "a fair day's pay for a fair day's work." "Fairness"
  and "justice" are most frequently proclaimed by the trade union officialdom as the goal
  of the workers and the union. A party member, however, understands that this standard
  is based upon a moral conception of the relations between the workers and the bosses
  which is very vague and ambiguous and actually presupposes the acceptance of the moral
  values of the ruling class.</p>

  <p>This conception disregards that in reality the relations between the workers and the
  bosses are governed not by the lofty moral standards proclaimed by the bosses, the
  government and the media, but by the objective economic laws of motion which govern the
  relations between capital and labor and are based upon the exploitation and
  subordination of the latter. What thus differentiates a party member from the general
  mass of the workers is that she or he has an <strong>objective appraisal</strong> of
  the relationship between the workers and the bosses.</p>

  <p>Look at any union contract in the big industries such as auto, steel or electric and
  you will almost always come across a preamble similar to the one in the current General
  Motors contract with the United Auto Workers:</p>

  <p>"The management of General Motors recognizes that it can not get along without labor
  any more than labor can get along without the management. Both are in the same business
  and the success of that business is vital to all concerned. This requires that both
  management and the employees work together to the end that the quality and cost of the
  product will prove increasingly satisfactory and attractive so that the business will
  be continuously successful.</p>

  <p>"General Motors holds that the basic interests of the employers and the employees
  are the same. However, at times employees and the management have different ideas on
  various matters affecting their relationship. The management of General Motors is
  convinced that there is no reason why these differences cannot be peacefully and
  satisfactorily adjusted by sincere and patient effort on both sides."</p>

  <p>This clause is not there by accident. It is demanded by almost all companies.
  Indeed, this view is promoted assiduously by the capitalist press, media, government,
  schools and universities, their ideologists and politicians.</p>

  <p>It cultivates the idea that there is an identity of interests between the workers
  and the bosses. Cooperation with this concept is considered mandatory. Of course, it is
  never to be interpreted that the employers have to cooperate with the workers. The
  identity of interests is based on the workers cooperating with the interests of the
  company and the bosses.</p>

  <p>This is and has been the prevailing view ever since the dawn of the so-called free
  enterprise system. It means the subordination of the workers to the interests of the
  employers.</p>

  <p>A workers' party must challenge and continually demonstrate the utter falsity and
  perniciousness of this idea. It must be continually demonstrated that the interests of
  the employers and the workers are diametrically opposed to each other, that the
  evolution of capitalist society demonstrates the existence of the class struggle rather
  than identity of class interests.</p>

  <p>By accepting the identity of interests between employers and workers, the latter are
  forced into a subordinate position. The theory of the identity of interests inculcates
  in the workers the idea that the employers get their share, namely profits, and the
  workers get theirs, wages. Both supposedly get the fruits of their contribution to the
  product.</p>

  <p>This is wholly erroneous. In reality the workers are subjected to exploitation while
  the employers reap the benefits of the unpaid labor of the workers. The difference
  between the class approach to the problem and even the most progressive trade union
  approach is that the latter would not acknowledge the objective significance of the
  relations between the employers and the workers.</p>

  <h3>Limits of trade union approach</h3>

  <p>The trade unions function as the collective bargaining agent for the workers. It is
  worth pondering on the meaning of the word bargaining. What it really means is to
  bargain over the sale of the labor power of the workers.</p>

  <p>The bargaining process involves a struggle over the terms of the sale and purchase
  for a limited period of the one commodity the workers have to sell--their labor power.
  It is bargaining over the rates and conditions of the exploitation of the workers. The
  workers attempt to both limit the conditions of exploitation and increase their wages,
  which means to diminish the profit of the bosses.</p>

  <p>No amount of effective bargaining negates the existence of the exploitation of the
  workers. It can change the conditions of the exploitation, of course, improving the
  working conditions and increasing the wages, but at all times it retains the
  exploitation relationship between capital and labor. This is the one invariable element
  in the relation between capital and labor, between the workers and the bosses.</p>

  <p>Party members must and do explain that in the struggle with the bosses their aim is
  to abolish the exploitation relationship. This then is the fundamental difference
  between them and other progressives whose views and conceptions are based on the
  existing ideology of the bosses which ties them to cooperation in the exploitation of
  the workers. No matter how good a union contract may be, it at best stabilizes the
  conditions of exploitation.</p>

  <p>It is not just a struggle of divergent conceptions. It is a struggle to bring to the
  workers an objective, dispassionate evaluation of the real relationship which exists.
  This is the very opposite of what the employers do.</p>

  <p>If you think the cooperative part of the preamble to any union contract may be
  accidental, let's look at still another and much more specific clause that appears in
  most big industry contracts and further defines the relationship from the bourgeois
  point of view. It is called "the management clause," and here is how it reads in the
  UAW-GM contract:</p>

  <p>"The right to hire; promote; discharge or discipline for cause; and to maintain
  discipline and efficiency of employees, is the sole responsibility of the Corporation
  except that Union members shall not be discriminated against as such. In addition, the
  products to be manufactured, the location of the plants, the schedules of production,
  the methods, processes and means of manufacturing are solely and exclusively the
  responsibility of the&nbsp;Corporation."</p>

  <p>The purpose of this clause is to bolster the exploitation relationship between the
  bosses and the workers by categorically stating that it is the bosses who own and
  control the plant. This is so the workers don't get any idea in the course of the
  struggle that they own the plant or that they are to operate it on their own. This
  clause too is not accidental.</p>

  <p>This together with the preamble makes sure that the capitalist system of
  exploitation is sanctified in every union contract. And when that is of no avail, they
  resort to the courts, the capitalist politicians and even the military, as they have
  done on occasion.</p>

  <h3>Problems of the strike weapon</h3>

  <p>The effort to fight back against the offensive unloosed by the bosses cannot always
  be done in the more elementary form of strike struggles during periods when the
  capitalist cycle of development is descending. The bosses may be able to hold out
  longer.</p>

  <p>One only has to look at what has happened in the last few years in strikes such as
  Brown &amp; Sharpe, Phelps Dodge and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel. (We'll discuss these
  again later.) In all three, despite the fact that the workers put up glorious and
  heroic struggles, the unions were not able to win victories equal to the strength of
  their strikes.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, Rudolf Hilferding wrote a book on <em>Finance Capital</em> with a
  chapter entitled "The Conflict Over the Labor Contract."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1"
  name="ref1">1</a></sup> He described in vivid detail the formal aspects of the struggle
  over the union contract. What is interesting here is that he dwelt in considerable
  detail on the merits of strike strategy. He explained the necessity for the unions to
  educate the workers so that they will strike against the employers at a time most
  advantageous to the workers.</p>

  <p>That time, he explained, is when the capitalist industrial cycle is in its upward,
  so-called prosperity swing. He said that when workers are making more money, making
  overtime, they may be less inclined to strike--although the advantage from the point of
  view of changing the balance of power with the employers is greatest then.</p>

  <p>Unquestionably, this is all too true. Few union leaders would contradict this and
  most workers, especially those in unions, understand very well that from the point of
  view of strike strategy it's very important to call a strike at a favorable time. The
  bigger problem is, what if there are attempted lockouts, what if the employers
  <strong>force</strong> a strike during a period of capitalist recession? Unfortunately,
  Hilferding didn't deal with that.</p>

  <p>The period since the Second World War shows that these capitalist recessions tend to
  be of a protracted character and capitalist overproduction can continue for a long
  period. Agricultural production, for instance, has been characterized by a glut since
  1979. This has resulted in depressing effects in the food and processing industries for
  a considerable period. There's a glut in all kinds of metals and there is no question
  that there is a glut in world production of steel.</p>

  <p>Some of the imperialist countries, most of all the U.S., are trying to solve this
  problem by putting up high tariff walls, which President Reagan enforced in 1984. This
  probably has resulted in an increase in steel production, for example. But that has not
  overcome the general condition of capitalist overproduction in steel.</p>

  <p>If steel can be characterized as stagnant because of capitalist overproduction, all
  the more is this true in copper, tin and aluminum. Needless to say, iron ore has long
  been in a slump, and while coal mining has somewhat stabilized, it is nowhere near the
  level of the 1970s. The times are not propitious for a strike in coal on the basis of
  any upward cycle of capitalist production.</p>

  <p><em>Business Week</em><sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> has estimated that the glut in
  petroleum extraction could last well into the 21st century. And similar conditions
  persist in other industries, such as textiles.</p>

  <p>Although some industries seem to be relatively more secure from protracted
  capitalist recession, such as health care and other service industries, this can
  generally be explained on the basis that the steep recession stage has not
  <strong>yet</strong> affected them. The bourgeois press has cultivated the myth that
  some industries are recession proof. But this is altogether fraudulent. There are no
  such industries. It is just that the crisis reaches them later or less severely.</p>

  <p>Once the workers are frozen into the capital-labor relationship, once that is
  dogmatically accepted as the permanent condition of the workers, once this business of
  a fair day's work for a fair day's pay is the conception, it inevitably follows that
  the workers must make concessions regardless of whether the union is strong or weak.
  The issue becomes saving the company or industry.</p>

  <p>In reality the company, if they mean by that the physical plant and so on, is in no
  danger of going under. No natural disaster is threatening it. It's only the
  <strong>ownership</strong> that may undergo some changes, from one individual to
  another, or to another group of employers in the case of bankruptcy.</p>

  <p>So that the policy of concessions flows directly and inevitably from the acceptance
  of the capital-labor relationship, from the acceptance of exploitation as the permanent
  condition of the working class. The ideology corresponding to this can only be that of
  class collaboration. It is very deeply ingrained into the consciousness of the workers
  by the press, the media, the courts, the pulpit and the schools and universities.</p>

  <p>At times the demand for concessions by the workers becomes almost hysterical. And
  yet the workers are not inclined to surrender to the hysteria. Their very instincts
  lead them to opposition. But again, by accepting the capital-labor relationship, they
  prescribe for themselves a very narrow field for the struggle: the economic struggle,
  which usually means strikes, stoppages which interrupt capitalist production.</p>

  <p>These of course are very important and indispensable. There can be no denying the
  effectiveness of the strike weapon. The strike weapon, the weapon which interrupts
  production, is regarded as a calamity for the individual employers of the capitalist
  class, but not because it stops production as such.</p>

  <p>There is still a great deal of production that goes on in contemporary society which
  the capitalist class does not get worked up about if it is interrupted--the work people
  do at home, on their own small farms, or generally useful work. The interruptions the
  capitalists are opposed to are the interruptions of <strong>capitalist</strong>
  production, which means the interruption of the source of their profits. When this
  happens, the strike weapon is regarded as a mortal enemy, especially if it is of a
  protracted character and at a time when it is inconvenient for the employers.</p>

  <p>But, again, the strike weapon has its limitations, particularly in the period we are
  addressing: that phase of development which is characterized by protracted capitalist
  economic crisis. The strike struggle alone, confining the union to economic means, is
  inadequate.</p>

  <p>Of course, the first and most important condition necessary to make a strike
  successful is to obtain united fronts with other workers and to maintain a solid
  working class front. This would hardly be opposed or denied by even the most
  casehardened bureaucrats, nor would they oppose political action as they see it,
  meaning to enlist "friendly" capitalist politicians with so-called pro-labor records.
  But this too is usually a drawn-out process and is rarely effective enough to determine
  the course of the strike in favor of the workers. It may be helpful, and often is, but
  in and of itself is not decisive.</p>

  <p>What is needed is to supplement the strike weapon with additional weapons so as to
  have a variety of different forms of struggle in order to confront the ruling
  class.</p>

  <p>The economic struggle, especially on a plantwide or industrywide basis, is too
  narrow if for no other reason than that the employers are able to line up the
  capitalist state on their side. The struggle is an uneven one.</p>

  <p>Much more is needed in constructing a strategy for periods of chronic economic
  depression. These often culminate in a capitalist crisis which in turn could develop
  into a full-scale general political crisis of the system.</p>

  <p>Barring that unforeseen development, it is necessary to take some first steps which
  may have the effect of breaking out of the capital-labor relationship. What is meant
  here is not disruption, physical sabotage or anything of the sort, but to break up the
  sociological scheme of the capital-labor relationship, which is one of
  exploitation.</p>
