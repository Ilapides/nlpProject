  <h1>A Mixed Bag of Other Tactics</h1>

  <h3>The Youngstown case: what went wrong</h3>

  <p>While it is important to attempt to widen support for the workers in plant closings
  or plant takeovers, care has to be taken not to rely on public officials, the
  government and courts as the fundamental lever in the struggle against the huge
  multinationals and conglomerates.</p>

  <p>The classic example of this is the case of the Campbell Works of the Youngstown
  Sheet &amp; Tube Company, which was shut down in September 1977 by the predatory, New
  Orleans-based conglomerate, Lykes Corporation. The subsequent passage of years should
  not dim the significance of the crisis it caused and the overwhelming suffering
  inflicted on the workers and their communities.</p>

  <p>A group of clergymen together with trade unionists from the area, Mahoning Valley in
  Ohio, formed a coalition to fight the shutdown. It was called the Ecumenical Coalition
  to Save Mahoning Valley.</p>

  <p>The overall objective was correct: a community takeover of the plant, to be operated
  by the workers. But it was based on pledging their own savings to purchase stock in
  such an enterprise. They also felt it necessary to convince the U.S. Department of
  Housing and Urban Development to grant them $300,000 to finance a detailed feasibility
  study.</p>

  <p>Under pressure of the times and the then-existing mood of militancy, the pressure
  exerted was sufficient to get the grant of $300,000. The contract, however, was given
  to the National Center for Economic Alternatives (NCEA). After more than a year of
  study and research the NCEA, led by economists Gar Alperovitz and Jeff Faux, concluded
  that a profitable community takeover could work if the federal government would provide
  $15 million up front in grants and $394 million in federally guaranteed loans, plus a
  list of Sheet &amp; Tube's old customers.</p>

  <p>It is often thought that the plant-closing era started with the Reagan
  administration. This is altogether erroneous. The Carter administration in this major
  case demonstrated no greater regard for the workers.</p>

  <p>The Carter administration at first agreed in principle to the plan, but this was in
  reality a ploy. After a long delay and maneuvering by U.S. Attorney General Griffin
  Bell and others, and the runaround to the U.S. Economic Development Administration, the
  loan was turned down. That ended the matter.</p>

  <p>The idea of a takeover was correct, and so was putting pressure on the Carter
  administration. But what was woefully wrong in all this was for the researchers to
  attempt to prove over an extended period that if the money were granted, it would be a
  profitable enterprise. That should not be the aim of a takeover at all. It should not
  be contingent on profitability but on the maintenance and operation of the plant.</p>

  <p>The U.S. post office was run by the government for almost two centuries, and
  profitability was never a criterion. It was deemed necessary to meet the needs of
  industry and of developing communications and also because of the growing number of
  communities that needed service. The airlines were all granted monumental sums by the
  government, and it was not based on any conception that the particular enterprise had
  to prove its profitability. The expenditures were all seen as necessary for
  development.</p>

  <p>What could be more important than the maintenance of such a key project in the heart
  of the steel area as Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube?</p>

  <p>The aim of a workers' takeover is to demonstrate the willingness, the determination
  to take hold of the means of production and to operate them, forcing the government to
  subsidize the plant as it has done for the infrastructure of all U.S. industry--but
  this time for the benefit of the workers.</p>

  <p>This can only be done by broadening and widening the struggle, not by conducting it
  on an isolated basis. More than ever the responsibility rests on the top trade union
  leaders who have the allegiance of millions of workers. These apparently local
  struggles have national significance for all the workers and all the oppressed. To
  leave the communities to deal with them on their own is not only gross neglect but
  downright malfeasance in office.</p>

  <p>Another attempt by the workers to keep the plants open took place at U.S. Steel in
  Youngstown. The case went before Judge Thomas Lambros, who had this to say: "The court
  has spent many hours searching for a way to cut to the heart of the economic reality
  that obsolescence and market forces demand the closing of the Mahoning Valley plant and
  yet the lives of 3,500 workers and their families and the supporting Youngstown
  community cannot be dismissed as inconsequential. U.S. Steel should not be permitted to
  leave the Youngstown area devastated after drawing from the lifeblood of the community
  for so many years."<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>So far, so good. Then comes the punch line. "Unfortunately, the mechanism to reach
  this ideal settlement, to recognize this new property right, is not in existence in the
  code of laws of our nation."</p>

  <p>But it is! It's enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which states
  that no person shall be deprived of their property without due process of law. The
  Youngstown workers over these many, many years, like all other workers, have a property
  right in their jobs.</p>

  <p>It would be as easy as pie to see this as not only just but perfectly logical if the
  judge himself were not beholden to other property rights, the rights of the bosses,
  while sanctimoniously shedding crocodile tears over the workers.</p>

  <p>Of course, there should be local legislation to deal with this as well as federal
  legislation, and that's what prenotification is all about. But local laws are set up
  merely to implement from a legal point of view what already is and should be considered
  as the basic, organic law that supposedly rules the country--the Constitution.</p>

  <h3>Eminent domain</h3>

  <p>Eminent domain means the right of the government to take private property for public
  use, indeed, any use that the government sees fit. Every state in the union, including
  Hawaii and Alaska, has that right enacted into law. It is also sanctioned by the
  federal government, which has long used eminent domain to acquire land or other forms
  of private property for public use. Almost all of the states have some provision which
  gives the various units of the state--county, city or other municipality--the right to
  use eminent domain.</p>

  <p>The method by which this is done is called a condemnation proceeding. It usually
  calls for a public hearing; after a certain period of time the city, state, county or
  federal government proceeds to take over the private property.</p>

  <p>It's important to remember how the practice of eminent domain started. It began way
  back when the feudal monarchies were just establishing themselves and when they
  actually robbed the peasants of the land to establish their domain--the palace grounds
  and the royal estate. During the period of capitalist development, this power was taken
  over by the bourgeois state, but many provisions were made to ensure some form of
  compensation, which was left up to either a jury or the judicial process.</p>

  <p>Condemnation proceedings are an everyday occurrence in the U.S. and the law journals
  carry regular notices of them. The importance of eminent domain to the workers has
  arisen in the light of the current epidemic of plant closings and threats from the
  employers which make job insecurity a daily worry. Workers in plants that have already
  been closed or partially dismantled, or are on the verge, have given consideration to
  the possibility of utilizing the stratagem of eminent domain as a means to take over
  the plants, equipment and facilities of the corporations in an effort to stop the
  barbarous vandalism these giant multinational corporations and big banks are
  pursuing.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that not only the federal government but the state, city and
  municipal governments have a right to delegate their authority for the use of eminent
  domain to a nongovernmental body. The government contributes funds, that is,
  appropriates money for this authority and gives it the right to operate, sometimes
  almost autonomously.</p>

  <p>One example is the construction of a bridge to connect two cities divided by a body
  of water. The bridge authority, whether instituted by two cities or two states, is
  authorized to build the bridge and often to collect the tolls. The same procedure is
  used in the building of a tunnel like New York City's Holland and Lincoln tunnels, both
  operated by the New York-New Jersey Port Authority.</p>

  <p>The most famous example was the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), established during
  the Roosevelt administration. It was subsidized by the federal government and turned
  out to be a vast boon to the communities it served.</p>

  <p>How does this process start? It doesn't usually originate with the government. Most
  often it's big businessmen, real estate developers and construction companies who
  present plans to the government to show how it can be done. The government then creates
  an authority, composed mostly of these very same people, and money is appropriated to
  run the project. Where there's a considerable degree of community awareness, which most
  of the time has been lacking, or where the labor movement has concerned itself, they
  have some input. This happens rarely, however.</p>

  <p>Considering the magnitude of the havoc created by plant closures, a group of
  community and church leaders and activists from the steel areas met in the spring of
  1985 in Homestead, Pennsylvania, for the purpose of using eminent domain for a workers'
  takeover. They took the idea of eminent domain from the Tri-State Conference on Steel
  which has been in existence for a number of years, and announced an effort to establish
  a Steel Valley Authority.</p>

  <p>The city of Pittsburgh is said to have given $50,000 to help in the project. A
  number of officials in the tri-state area have given their approval to it. It includes
  mayors from cities in the three states of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia and some
  state representatives from the Pennsylvania legislature. The question is how to get
  this off the ground since it has already been in the discussion stage for a
  considerable period of time.</p>

  <p>There is no question that the idea of a tri-state Steel Valley Authority (SVA) could
  take on considerable momentum. It already has a wide variety of community people and
  steel workers who have shown interest in the project. The United Steel Workers union
  (USWA) through some of its local leaders has shown considerable interest. The
  international thus far has given it minimal attention, but it could become involved to
  a much larger extent. The problem really is how to proceed from here. That's what most
  workers are concerned with--what next?</p>

  <p>We have seen how the bosses, real estate developers, construction companies and
  bankers do it. They approach the government and the government delegates the authority
  to them and also gives them abundant funds to start whatever project is suggested. By
  giving a small donation, the city of Pittsburgh has done one thing. It has validated
  the legal existence of the SVA. This could be important depending on what is done
  next.</p>

  <p>If it remains a study group or, worse yet, a means of diverting the interests of the
  workers in the area, which is apparently what the capitalist politicians and bosses in
  the tri-state area hope, then of course it's an exercise in futility, just as in the
  Youngstown case.</p>

  <p>But there's a very important opportunity if the SVA begins to act in earnest. First,
  it must demand a considerable sum of money from the tri-state legislatures. Second, it
  can subpoena the books and records of the banks and companies and then project mass
  actions on the basis of the tri-state authority, supported by the unions--which must be
  the integral part, the most important component in the SVA.</p>

  <p>Truly mass actions have to be planned with a view toward occupying the most
  sensitive facilities connected with the tri-state area, which has all these years lived
  on the sweat and blood of the workers and is now contemptuously disregarding their
  plight. This involves not merely the occupation of the idle plants threatened with
  foreclosure but also the banks, particularly the Mellon bank and its various
  instrumentalities.</p>

  <p>In an earlier period the groups involved carried out sporadic activities,
  demonstrations and self-sacrifice, including imprisonment. The problem was that all
  this had not yet attained mass proportions. This time around, from a strictly objective
  point of view, it is possible to renew the process on a larger mass scale and to claim
  full legality.</p>

  <p>The very existence of the SVA and the fact that a central city, the city of
  Pittsburgh, recognized its existence, provides a significant legal means to perfect the
  whole process of eminent domain. From here on the actual utilizing of eminent domain
  depends on mobilizing the broader sections of the steel workers and their communities
  for the purposes of a takeover of not only the idled plants but of such facilities as
  banking, insurance companies and their satellite corporate entities.</p>

  <p>Another conference is definitely needed, but this time an attempt must be made to
  broaden it into a rank-and-file movement of workers in the tri-state area. This
  conference should detail the next concrete steps to be taken, which involve the mass of
  the workers and all segments of the communities in the affected area. The masses must
  be made confident that this time around they have a legal right to do what needs to be
  done to perfect the right of eminent domain.</p>

  <p>Actually doing it lays the basis for legal ratification in custom and practice, as
  we said earlier. All this could be used as a stimulus to arouse the mass movement to
  take the necessary measures. If bankers, real estate developers and construction
  companies can draw up their own plans for their projects, come to the city or state and
  get it to ratify their plan by creating an authority, why can't the workers in the
  distressed communities get the same treatment?</p>

  <p>Surely if the bankers, real estate developers and construction companies felt it was
  feasible to construct a new bullet rail line such as the ones now in vogue in Japan and
  Europe, the governments would jump at the opportunity.</p>

  <p>Well, the workers have their own plan to reopen the plants and do whatever else is
  necessary for the survival of the tri-state steel communities. This requires funds of a
  massive character, which must not be held up by delaying tactics requiring that the
  plan be submitted for study to demonstrate its feasibility and profitability. No, what
  mass struggle can do is show that the plans are not only feasible and practical but are
  based on urgent necessity.</p>

  <h3>ESOPs</h3>

  <p>What are ESOPs? ESOPs--Employee Stock Ownership Plans--are a form of veiled
  ownership by management where nominal ownership is by the workers. A study by
  <em>Business Week</em><sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> showed that in early 1985 there
  were already 7,000 companies which had enrolled nearly 10 million workers into ESOPs.
  In the 1970s, there were fewer than half a million workers in ESOPs. There is no
  breakdown available on the percentage of union as against non-union workers. Most are
  in unorganized plants, but a considerable number are covered by union contracts.</p>

  <p>ESOPs pose a problem of considerable importance to the trade union movement. Not
  only are they one of the crudest forms of class collaboration, but they also have a
  tendency to eventually swallow up the trade unions and deprive them of their
  independence.</p>

  <p>The idea of employee stock ownership is not a new one. It began to flourish in the
  late 1920s and was fueled by the wild stock market speculation of that period. The idea
  at that time was for large corporations to put on promotion schemes for workers to buy
  company stock. However, what was considered a strong current for workers to become part
  "owners" of management came to an abrupt end with the great stock market crash of
  October 1929. The embryo ESOP movement collapsed, as did thousands of corporations, in
  the wake of the great capitalist crisis. It didn't get revived until the early
  1970s.</p>

  <p>During the great CIO upsurge of the labor movement in the 1930s such stock schemes
  were almost always disregarded and scorned by the trade unions. But, as can be seen,
  the capitalist crisis which began in 1979 and has continued for many industries up
  until this writing has revived them to an alarming extent.</p>

  <p>The problem for the union is a two-fold one. First, how does the union devise ways
  and means to resist them where possible in the face of what is sometimes great
  eagerness on the part of the workers, who hope to save their jobs? The other problem is
  how to protect the workers' investment in the many plants and industries where ESOPs
  have already been established for some period of time and see to it that management
  does not plunder and pillage the savings of the workers by various stock schemes which
  dilute the workers' share in the company.</p>

  <p>The purpose of any and all stockholding schemes is to tie the workers down to
  management's fundamental interests, to win loyalty to the company as against their own
  interests. In this connection it should be remembered that stock manipulation fraud is
  a long-time characteristic of big business and especially the huge multinational
  corporations. No corporation, however big, is free from stock fluctuations and
  deliberate attempts to water down classes of stock in order to liquidate the interests
  of the stockholders.</p>

  <p>The usual scheme by which an ESOP is put across is very much aided and assisted by a
  series of laws enacted by Congress beginning as long ago as 1974. Sixteen laws in all
  were passed, mostly the result of big business lobbying. The most important one, passed
  in 1984, gives the banks some very luscious tax incentives pushed through by the Reagan
  administration along with other tax breaks for big business and the banks.</p>

  <p>The way these things work is as follows: A company suddenly demands huge concessions
  from the workers, claiming bad business conditions. Layoffs are threatened and finally
  management seemingly throws up its hands and says the company is on the brink of
  failure. It suggests that the workers should now become the owners of the plant as a
  result of accepting an Employee Stock Ownership Plan.</p>

  <p>Usually the plan does not give the workers the right to vote their stock but,
  depending upon the situation, does give them a director or two or, as in the case of
  Hyatt-Clark Industries, where the workers are represented by the UAW, three directors.
  The plan is worked out by expert ESOP consultants who have long worked on these things,
  especially the company headed by Louis O. Kelso, a San Francisco investment banking
  firm.</p>

  <p>What happens then? The company often claims that it's got a cash-flow crisis and
  proceeds to get a bank loan. Banks, which are usually reluctant to advance money to
  companies in danger, are eager in the case of ESOPs. That's because they get special
  privileges and can write off as much as 50% of the interest as well as the loan, and
  other complicated privileges. The bank passes the money to ESOP. Then ESOP passes the
  loan to the company.</p>

  <p>The company in return issues the stock to ESOP and it is then held in trust for the
  workers, but is not given to them directly. It is held in their account.</p>

  <p>As we said earlier, corporate manipulation and fraud is a long-time practice of big
  business to which the Securities and Exchange Commission, especially under the
  Reaganites (assuming that the company is one obligated to register with the SEC),
  frequently "closes its eyes."</p>

  <p>How have things worked out thus far? There are two principal examples which should
  be borne in mind. Hyatt-Clark Industries, previously mentioned, and the Dan River
  textile plant in Danville, Va. Before any ESOP plan, Dan River had 12,000 workers. Over
  a period of time this has now been reduced to about 8,000. The workers as a result of a
  campaign of fear and the constant propaganda about imports were persuaded not only to
  make considerable wage concessions but also to trade in their pension plan rights in
  favor of the ESOP.</p>

  <p>The company thereafter sold its three Greenville plants and the workers had to learn
  about it from the newspapers. In addition the company closed another plant under an
  ESOP plan and buried the money from the workers' earnings in an account operated by
  trustees, who are usually appointed by management. (In this case, the trustee is the
  United Virginia Bank.) And the trustees of these ESOP accounts usually vote with
  management on the board of directors.</p>

  <p>In the case of the Hyatt-Clark Industries UAW local, the union had three
  representatives on the board of directors, which included former UAW President Douglas
  Fraser. After considerable wage and benefit concessions made by the union, the company
  did show a profit. The company then decided that the $600,000 profit should go to
  purchase new machinery for modernization. The workers wanted it to be added to their
  wages. The company directors outvoted the union 9-to-1, which outraged the workers.
  After a series of occasional slowdowns the union agreed to cutbacks and layoffs
  instead. The overall result was concessions by the union which strengthened the hold of
  management.</p>

  <p>As of this writing, the Hyatt company has been sold off to an Oklahoma company and
  Owen Bieber, the president of the UAW, has assured the new owners that the union will
  make further concessions.</p>

  <p>There are cases where, as a result of threats of shutdown and bankruptcy, union or
  non-union workers have accepted very far-reaching concessions resulting in steep cuts
  in wages and benefits in exchange for two or three directors. This happened in the
  airline industry at Eastern and TWA, which used the strikebreaking pushed through by
  Continental Airlines as a weapon of intimidation. A study remains to be made on how
  many other workers have been pushed back in this way.</p>

  <p>The entire experience of ESOPs, and there are a great many varieties of them, is
  that they not only leave the workers with a lowered income but are attempts to tie the
  workers securely to the chariot wheels of class collaboration. With some of the large
  oil and other multinationals intent on making steep cuts in the workforce and depriving
  the workers of benefits, they deliberately instigate a campaign of fear that the
  companies will be taken over by "raiders," such men as Carl Icahn, T. Boone Pickens and
  others. These are cases where ESOPs have been in progress for a period of time, such as
  at Phillips Petroleum, National Can Corporation and others.</p>

  <p>In Weirton Steel, an old union-busting company which formed a so-called independent
  company union many years ago, many concessions have been made and the company has eked
  out an existence only because of the steep concessions made by the workers, who have no
  real rights over management of the company.</p>

  <p>In the Phillips Petroleum case, the management had promoted one of the most
  sophisticated fear campaigns among the workers about a piratical takeover by outside
  interests. It virtually mobilized the employees in entire towns where the company had
  locations behind its defensive strategy to ward off a takeover, which would have
  allegedly lost many jobs for the workers.</p>

  <p>In the end, however, the management made a secret deal with Icahn; then the company
  proceeded with the layoffs and cutbacks, including of salaried staff people as well.
  This also happened in National Can. And at Dan River, the company also put up Icahn as
  the great danger who was threatening a takeover. It then of course made a deal which
  resulted in more concessions.</p>

  <p>The same thing happened with CBS and Ted Turner. CBS launched a campaign to line up
  the workers on its side against this extreme rightwinger who threatened free speech,
  but once the takeover threat from Turner was over, it proceeded to lay off hundreds of
  workers.</p>

  <h3>What workers can do about existing ESOPs</h3>

  <p>In industries and plants where ESOPs already prevail, the union's position should be
  first, that on the expiration of the contract, ESOP accounts should be converted into
  cash to be distributed to the workers in the form of wage increases. Where this proves
  impossible, the union should demand that there be open board meetings, and that the
  ESOP trust account be run by union-appointed administrators. If the union has a vote on
  the board, there should be prior consultation with the union and membership, and where
  decisions are made they should be ratified by the union membership. Local unions should
  have their constitutions amended in such a way as to make the ESOPs and ESOP management
  subject to union control.</p>

  <p>As against ESOPs, where the workers feel that a strike may be ineffective because of
  the deterioration of the industry as a whole, they should fight for workers' control.
  Workers' control is not a permanent or stable form of struggle, given the nature of the
  capitalist system. However, it is superior to the ESOPs as a transitional form in the
  overall class struggle against the bosses. In the first place, it makes all decisions
  regarding operations and control only in consultation with and by consent of the
  workers. Unlike ESOPs, it does not put financial control in the hands of a bogus group
  of management-appointed or bank-controlled supervisors who in effect make decisions
  without any vote of the workers.</p>

  <p>Workers' control was instituted in some of the European countries in the period
  immediately after the Second World War and made significant gains in West Germany, some
  areas of Belgium, France and other countries. But in the absence of the perspective of
  a socialist transformation they gradually gave way to greater and greater management
  control. However, as in the case of Sweden, they are still far superior to anything
  that the ESOPs have accomplished in the U.S. In Europe, to the extent that workers'
  control was instituted, it was a means of elevating the workers' interests within the
  framework of the capitalist system. The ESOPs here have been mostly a form of attacking
  the workers' interests.</p>

  <h3>ESOPs and the Great Crash</h3>

  <p>There are any number of bourgeois economists who have drawn parallels between the
  present speculative surge in the stock market and the one which touched off the great
  economic collapse of October 1929. Financial news writers in particular have drawn
  attention to the fact that the widely heralded period of capitalist prosperity in the
  late 1920s was characterized by a growing agricultural crisis which sent grain and
  other agricultural commodities slumping to lower and lower levels. At the same time the
  apologists from bourgeois academia were still singing praises to the wonders of the
  free enterprise system and how well it was performing.</p>

  <p>What is of particular interest now is that an anti-labor offensive was also in
  progress during that period. It was little noticed in the merry celebrations of the
  capitalist class over their growing prosperity.</p>

  <p>An element of exceptional importance in relation to the present situation was the
  big drive to get the workers to purchase corporate stock and also increasing pressure
  on the workers to get into various employee stock ownership plans. Among those pushing
  hardest from bourgeois academia during the booming 1920s was Thomas Nixon Carver, a
  professor of political economy at Harvard. He wrote a widely publicized book at the
  time with the attractive title of <em>The Present Economic Revolution in the United
  States.</em></p>

  <p>Carver was lyrical about the developing period and vigorously pushed the stock
  ownership idea. Louis Kelso and his collaborators of today are really a sort of 1980
  version of Carver, who at that time wrote, "The only economic revolution now under way
  is going on in the United States. It is a revolution that is to wipe out the
  distinction between laborers and capitalists by making laborers their own capitalists
  and by compelling the capitalists to become laborers of one kind or another.</p>

  <p>"There are at least three kinds of evidence that indicate roughly the extent to
  which laborers are becoming capitalists. First the rapid growth of savings deposits;
  second the investment by laborers in the shares of corporations; third the growth of
  labor banks. The saving power of American working men is so great that if they would
  save and carefully invest their savings, in 10 years they would be one of the
  dominating financial powers of the world."<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>

  <p>As everyone now knows, the Great Crash which followed wiped out many of the stock
  flotations held by workers and even more by middle class elements. It brought on not 10
  years of dominating financial power by the workers but a 10-year worldwide capitalist
  recession which was only diverted by the gathering momentum of the Second World
  War.</p>

  <p>There were also attempts during the 1920s to draw elements of the trade union
  movement into the organization of labor banks. The economic collapse virtually wiped
  them all out. Some, such as the Brotherhood Holding Company of the Brotherhood of
  Locomotive Engineers, had made huge investments and collapsed even before the
  capitalist economic crisis got underway.</p>

  <p>It is well to bear all this in mind at a time when millions of workers have part of
  their wages in stock ownership, a variety of private pension funds and other methods of
  deferred wages. While a good many of these are supposed to be guaranteed by the
  government, pension funds and all kinds of life insurance plans by municipalities and
  states and even the federal government have yet to be tested in the event of an
  economic collapse.</p>

  <p>Once a worker's paycheck is deposited in the bank, it enters into the mainstream of
  the flow of capital formation. It is true that the capitalist class as a whole controls
  it, but on the other hand it is the blind forces of the capitalist market which
  motivate the capitalists in their insatiable drive for profits.</p>

  <p>Every effort has to be made by the trade unions, indeed by all progressive
  organizations, to preserve and secure the savings of the workers. These are prey to
  being pillaged, plundered or defrauded by an endless variety of schemes concocted by
  the growing multitude of labor consultants hired by the bosses whose aim is to tie the
  independent class interests of the workers to that of the avaricious and predatory
  interests of the giant corporations and banks. The only certain power of the working
  class and particularly of the trade union movement lies not in collaboration with the
  bosses but in independent organization and class struggle against the bosses.</p>

  <h3>Vigilance committees</h3>

  <p>In the wee hours of December 11, 1985, the General Electric Company (GE) acquired
  the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), owner of the NBC television network. It is said
  to be the biggest non-oil merger or acquisition in history, worth $6.28 billion.</p>

  <p>The merger was carried out in secret by a meeting of the board of directors for both
  companies. There are many facets to this giant merger of two multinational defense
  contractors, but what ought to interest most of the workers at these two companies is
  that none of the several strong unions which represent them were in any way consulted
  or even notified. It should also be noted that the stockholders were not informed
  either, except those big ones who were on the inside track and close to the banks which
  engineered the deal. This merger or acquisition, whichever you call it, involved no
  less than 300,000 workers at GE and 106,000 at RCA.<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> This
  deal concerned them.</p>

  <p>These more than 400,000 workers created the wealth of these two industrial giants,
  counted in the billions. Yet the joint statement issued by the two companies announced
  that they now had "an excellent strategic opportunity for both companies that will help
  their competitiveness in world markets" and that they would "successfully compete now
  with anyone, anywhere, in every market we serve."</p>

  <p>This meant first embarking on a program to cut down on duplication and reduce costs,
  which in the final analysis means cutting labor time and eliminating thousands of jobs.
  Both these companies have been doing it with a vengeance since 1978.</p>

  <p>There have been no big mergers in the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions which
  did not end up with vast cutbacks and layoffs. That's their whole purpose. When a giant
  merger like this takes place it means that these corporate monsters have targeted the
  workers for job elimination. None of this, by the way, was mentioned in the
  announcement by GE and RCA. But the layoffs will follow as night follows day.</p>

  <p>Both of these companies also have had experience in spinoffs or breakups. The two
  seem to be contradictory but are not. For instance, when RCA sold off Hertz Rent-A-Car
  and the CIT financial corporation, layoffs in the sold-off divisions followed. When GE
  sold off Utah International, the same thing happened. The purpose of mergers as well as
  spinoffs and breakups is job elimination. That's where the savings for the bosses come
  in. For them, raising productivity means cutting down on labor time.</p>

  <p>This is what all the predatory struggles among the giant corporations are all about.
  They concern how to get rid of as many workers as possible from the payrolls in order
  to line the pockets of the top corporate bureaucracy and the bankers.</p>

  <p>Most of these mergers and acquisitions are carried out in secrecy. While one of the
  purposes of secrecy is to guard against competitors as well as stockholders, the other
  is to keep the workers in the dark. When a rumor starts regarding a merger or
  acquisition, workers become more and more worried about their jobs, especially since
  they receive no information about what will happen to them once these industrial
  combinations or divisions take effect.</p>

  <p>What must be done in this connection? Vigilance committees have to be established
  among the workers to monitor the situation long before these acquisitions, mergers and
  resulting plant shut-downs begin. These vigilance committees should act as intelligence
  groupings for the security of the jobs of all workers. Of course, where possible these
  committees need to be established not only by local union committees but by
  international unions on an industry-wide basis. Most people would be surprised how easy
  it is for workers to get the necessary information. Some information can be obtained
  from the press, where it is usually hidden in the financial pages. But there are other
  ways.</p>

  <p>Working cooperatively, the unions and production workers have access to clerical
  help and maintenance workers in the executive offices of the corporation, even in the
  board rooms where the corporate officers meet. It is well known that these giant
  corporations have a network of spies of their own who eavesdrop on workers, even in the
  restrooms. Is that not so?</p>

  <p>Well, workers have the right to do the same thing. It is one thing when a union is
  large and strong enough to be able to get expert financial advice, analyze the annual
  reports of the corporations and follow the stock of the individual corporation on the
  stock exchange. That shifts the task away from the workers to more specialized people.
  But workers have a way of finding the information through workers.</p>

  <p>Remember the secret internal memo in which General Motors' plans for cutting back
  the workforce were spelled out in some detail? Well, it was obtained because a clerical
  worker brought it to the attention of the union. Telephone conversations and internal
  memos can and often do get into the hands of the union leadership. These are sometimes
  derelict in making them immediately available to the union membership or the
  appropriate committee, which in this case should be the vigilance committee. (Barry
  Bluestone and Bennett Harrison in their book<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> refer to
  reconnaissance committees, whose purpose is limited to research, while we are
  suggesting worker intelligence committees to counteract management's spy network.)</p>

  <p>What is needed is to apply the same strategy unions use at the beginning of every
  strike when the possibility of scabbing exists. The company has its informers and the
  strike committee knows some unfortunate workers may be susceptible to scabbing.
  Immediately upon calling the strike, a vigilance committee aware of this potential
  establishes a telephone tree where contact is immediately made with those susceptible
  to boss psychology.</p>

  <p>Also, before a strike takes place, the vigilance committee finds out the list of
  suppliers, customers, banking connections, everything. Its function is to watch out for
  all developments and present reports to the union and the public. All this should be in
  addition to what the union regularly does by way of getting the public literature of
  the company and analyzing it.</p>

  <p>All these measures have become more and more vital as the predatory corporations and
  their lust for super-profits relentlessly drive the workers and even themselves into a
  blind alley.</p>

  <h3>Hormel strike and the AFL-CIO leadership</h3>

  <p>Beginning on August 17, 1985, the 1,500 members of United Food and Commercial
  Workers Local P-9 at the Hormel company in Austin, Minnesota, went on strike against
  drastic wage cuts and for improved medical benefits, compensation for on-the-job
  injuries, seniority and grievance and arbitration procedures. In October 1984, the
  company had unilaterally reduced wages from $10.69 an hour to $8.25, although through
  arbitration this was raised to $9.25 by the time the strike was forced on the
  union.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that the international union sanctioned the strike, the local union
  was subjected to considerable attack by the international and the top officialdom of
  the AFL-CIO. William H. Wynn, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers,
  attacked the local for its "suicidal strategy," and issued a seven-page statement
  smearing the strike to the AFL-CIO Executive Board meeting in Bal Harbour, Florida, on
  February 17, 1986. Lane Kirkland, the president of the AFL-CIO, gave his full
  endorsement to this statement.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the local was continuing its strike under the guns of the National
  Guard, which had been called out by Democratic Governor Rudy Perpich. By the middle of
  February the company was claiming it had resumed production with scabs brought in by
  the force of the National Guard and the courts, and was having strike leaders arrested
  for picketing the plant.</p>

  <p>There may be dozens of other strikes that are similarly bitter and protracted but
  are not publicized. It's not easy to tabulate them since the Reagan administration has
  ceased taking note of such events. The Bureau of Labor Statistics no longer counts
  strikes which involve less than a thousand workers.</p>

  <p>The bitterness and duration of the Hormel strike, important as they are, don't
  account for its special significance. The fundamental reason why this strike attained
  special importance and drew the attention and support of so many rank-and-file workers
  from coast to coast is that it became the symbol of resistance to the steady,
  undeviating line of concessions to the bosses by most of the AFL-CIO trade union
  hierarchy.</p>

  <p>Enormous sympathy was accumulated by the local leadership precisely because it had
  taken on a task which millions of workers felt was necessary and indispensable for
  their future welfare. The strike became a veritable struggle between capital and labor,
  a test of strength between the working class and the capitalist class, which was still
  going on as of this writing.</p>

  <p>However, there has been no real test of strength between the organized working class
  with all its millions of followers and the capitalist class. The potentialities of the
  struggle of the two class camps have not been brought forward.</p>

  <p>Hormel is at best a medium-sized company among the giant corporations of the U.S.
  Whatever its financial connections may be, as an economic and industrial unit it can
  count its assets in the millions, or at the most a couple of billion. However, it is by
  no means of the stature of General Motors, Ford, or U.S. Steel, which count their
  assets in the tens and hundreds of billions.</p>

  <p>The organized labor movement as a whole is the product of struggles which have
  successfully taken on all of these major corporations and accumulated vast experience,
  resources and a following of millions upon millions of workers, both organized and
  unorganized. While the capitalist press and media as usual may have been solidly lined
  up on the side of the company, in the eventuality of a real test between labor and
  capital, between the workers and the bosses, it remains to be seen whether the ruling
  class would go even a short distance to support such a middle-sized minion of high
  finance and big industry.</p>

  <p>The ruling class is monolithic in its general advocacy of the anti-labor offensive.
  It would be another matter if, in an actual struggle, the labor movement dared to make
  a test case. The most advanced and militant sections of the trade union movement
  generously supported the strike, but mainly with moral support plus limited financial
  resources. In addition, many hundreds demonstrated militant solidarity by traveling
  many miles to help picket in sub-zero weather.</p>

  <p>Important and invaluable as this support was, it did not constitute a test of
  strength as against big capital. Instead of roundly denouncing the strike, what the
  AFL-CIO should have done was to show that they regarded the Hormel strike as a test of
  their collective strength and of their willingness and readiness to engage the company
  in a genuine contest. That would have turned around the whole situation in no time.</p>

  <p>The ruling class in the U.S. would be terrified at the prospect of a breakup of
  class peace between the workers and the bosses at a time it is faced with unprecedented
  revolutionary struggles around the world.</p>

  <p>The only thing the U.S. ruling class has going for it, in light of the international
  situation, is that at home it has been able to maintain class peace, the submission of
  the working class to the extortionate demands of the bosses at a crucial time in its
  history.</p>

  <p>The AFL-CIO labor bureaucracy, in its aversion to any test of strength, reflects the
  fear and apprehensions not of the workers but of the ruling class. It lacks a true
  measure of the potential political and social strength of the working class in the
  crucible of struggle.</p>

  <p>This is the crudest and narrowest form of what Lenin called economism--conducting a
  trade union struggle or any kind of localized struggle on the basis of narrow economic
  conceptions when the battle is in reality of a profoundly political character. The
  Hormel company, like dozens of others throughout the land, giant corporations as well
  as smallfry, joined the pack and demanded onerous concessions precisely because the
  labor hierarchy was more responsive to the demands and fears of the ruling class than
  to the class interests of the workers.</p>

  <p>Of course, in the initial stages of every capitalist recession the objective
  situation is unfavorable for the workers. They have to take a defensive posture while
  the capitalist class has the initiative and can take the offensive. But the whole
  historical experience of the working class shows that every prolonged anti-labor
  offensive was eventually followed by a labor upsurge. The time came when the workers
  did say, "Enough!" Such a time is now long overdue.</p>

  <p>The head of the UAW, Owen Bieber, speaking at a legislative conference of the UAW in
  Washington, D.C., on January 16, 1986, characterized the situation prevailing in the
  country and the labor movement as "the strongest conservative reaction in our
  lifetime." While this may be true, it is a general political trend generated by the
  ruling class. Bieber and others who politically lean in a social-democratic direction
  are using this as a rationalization for a policy of concessions to the bosses and
  swimming with the tide, rather than bucking it or finding ways and means to respond to
  the anti-labor offensive. That's the only way to overcome the political reaction.</p>

  <p>It's appropriate to recall an historic example of a test of strength between both
  classes that the workers won without firing a shot. After the 1937 victory of the
  General Motors workers as a result of the sit-down strike and the occupation of the
  plants by the workers, there was an unprecedented outcry from the capitalist press
  condemning Michigan Governor Frank Murphy, who had been the mediator between the UAW
  committee and the company's representative. They screamed about anarchy, chaos and the
  threatened revolution and warned John L. Lewis and all other labor leaders of what
  would befall them if such a struggle continued.</p>

  <p>At that time the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) headed by Philip Murray,
  John Brophy, Van A. Bittner, Bill Mitch and David McDonald, all working under the
  direction of John L. Lewis, were preparing for a test of strength in the most difficult
  and at that time strongest anti-labor and unorganized fortress of the capitalist class.
  The steel strike of 1919 had been crushed with many beatings, arrests, many families
  ruined and their homes lost.</p>

  <p>Even in the ranks of labor, many felt that U.S. Steel was mobilizing not only the
  capitalist media but the courts and the state's repressive forces to do it again if the
  SWOC leaders were to seriously embark on an effort to organize and win. There were many
  forebodings and fears, even in the ranks of militant workers, but at the same time they
  felt confident, not only because of the victory over General Motors but because they
  knew SWOC leaders could draw on the strength of labor in the event of a test between
  the seemingly omnipotent U.S. Steel Corporation and the organizing committee.</p>

  <p>It would have been a real test of strength, because the leaders were ready to do
  what was necessary in order to win. But the test was never carried to its ultimate
  conclusion. Why?</p>

  <p>Because this all-powerful, omnipotent corporation, supported by the biggest banks,
  capitulated without a struggle. "(T)he largest steel company in the world surrendered.
  The foe that the CIO had thought would be the toughest succumbed without a struggle. By
  a mere show of strength the SWOC had won a 10% wage increase, a 40-hour week and union
  recognition for thousands of steel workers employed by United States Steel. It would be
  difficult to say who was most surprised at U.S. Steel's capitulation, the workers or
  the tycoons. . . ."<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup></p>

  <p>It is precisely such preparation for a test of strength that is lacking in the labor
  movement today. The AFL-CIO let the struggle be carried on the shoulders of one local,
  with the widespread moral support of many other workers. It may have feared a
  generalized struggle between capital and labor, but the capitalist class itself is not
  ready or willing to undergo such a test. The most valuable asset it has at the moment,
  class peace in the midst of a revolutionary international situation, it would not
  surrender in the interests of just one of a multitude of huge companies.</p>

  <p>If U.S. Steel, backed by the mightiest bankers of the time, J.P. Morgan &amp;
  Company, could calculate that in its own interests it was the better part of wisdom to
  sign up with the SWOC, there's no valid reason why a similar evaluation would not be
  made this time as well. At any rate, should the ruling class, not just Hormel, alone
  decide to challenge the organized labor movement in a general contest between capital
  and labor, it would be a thousand times preferable to go through the experience of a
  great enriching struggle than to endure an abject, divisive, humiliating policy of
  surrender which history will not forget and a resurgent working class will condemn and
  pillory.</p>

  <h3>Inner struggles in the ruling class</h3>

  <p>Everywhere and in almost any period there are contradictory interests not only among
  the various capitalist states but among the various capitalist industries, as well as
  conflicts within each industry. Capitalist contradictions tear apart even the most
  giant corporations. Indeed, there is scarcely a huge conglomerate or multinational
  corporation that is not characterized by the sharpest antagonisms in the struggle for
  profit.</p>

  <p>Take, for instance, some of the terminology that is utilized in the inner struggles
  for control of their corporations. The last decade has brought forth such terms as
  "poison pill," which applies when one group of capitalists tries to ward off a takeover
  by another. The idea behind this is that the group making the offer for the takeover
  looks very attractive, but in reality is poison and full of booby-traps. It may
  intervene to ruin a takeover attempt by hostile forces, but that does not necessarily
  make it friendly, meaning that it would offer more profitable terms to reorganize or
  merge.</p>

  <p>Or take their attitude to bankers, who are frequently referred to not in hallowed
  terms like "advisers," but as "undertakers." Those who come out on top in any of these
  struggles are said to have engineered a "killing."</p>

  <p>Thus their relationships are anything but cooperative and harmonious. They may
  demand harmony and cooperation from the workers, but among themselves they are torn by
  the most destructive forms of inner struggle. All this is due to the driving force of
  capitalist competition, which in turn of course is based on the chase for
  super-profits.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the inner struggles inside management or among different cliques
  in the corporation or ruling class is of course very important. Vital as it is,
  however, to take cognizance of the antagonisms between various cliques and in
  management, especially among the giant corporations, it is utterly false to paint them
  as good guys and bad guys and try to construct a labor relations policy based on these
  inner struggles.</p>

  <p>The main and fundamental lever of the struggle at all times is the unity and
  solidarity of the workers. The inner antagonisms of the ruling class of even a small
  plant or corporation can be utilized as an auxiliary weapon but that should not
  interfere with organizing and mobilizing the workers for struggle.</p>
