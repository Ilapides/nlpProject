  <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

  <h1>The Crisis in the Trade Unions</h1>

  <p>Beginning in the late 1970s, U.S. big business and the government launched a
  coordinated assault on the wages and living conditions of the working class which, at
  the time this is being written, has lasted nearly six years. The magnitude of this
  drive, judged by previous historical standards, makes it the longest and most severe
  ever.</p>

  <p>This anti-labor attack did not fall from the sky. It is the product of a cumulative
  process over years. It has spanned successive U.S. administrations of both Republicans
  and Democrats, surfacing especially during the last two years of the Carter
  administration. That period saw the onerous double-barreled effects of stagflation--a
  large increase in unemployment accompanied by rising inflation--which gripped huge
  sections of the population, particularly the working class and the oppressed.</p>

  <p>Nor should it be forgotten that even in the early 1970s, presumably a prosperous
  period, the administration of Richard Nixon imposed so-called voluntary wage and price
  controls. This was meant to not merely control but to in some cases actually reduce
  real wages while prices of basic commodities for everyday living were already
  soaring.</p>

  <p>Some in the labor officialdom would like to ignore all this and confine themselves
  to a study of the Reagan years. This, however, would do violence to a clear
  understanding of the inseparable connection between the different phases in the
  struggle of the working class. It would put completely out of focus the sequence of
  events and their interconnections.</p>

  <h3>AFL-CIO report on "changing situation of workers"</h3>

  <p>On the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Committee for Industrial Organization
  (CIO), the Executive Council of the now merged AFL-CIO issued a study dealing with "the
  changing situation of workers and their unions."<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>"The AFL-CIO Executive Council," the study said, "created the Committee on the
  Evolution of Work as part of its effort to assess the significance of the changes in
  the work environment for the federation and its affiliates." The committee was assisted
  by a group of luminaries that included Professor James Medoff of Harvard University,
  Louis Harris &amp; Associates, and Professor Thomas Kochan of MIT, who in fact prepared
  the study.</p>

  <p>The study purported to review numerous complex factors which had created the
  situation confronting the workers and their unions. It discussed the "evolution of
  work" and arrived at the conclusion that "the United States--indeed every
  industrialized nation--is undergoing a scientific, technological, economic revolution
  every bit as significant as the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century."</p>

  <p>The study, however, did not live up to its promise. While it presented a mass of
  statistical data, most of which had already been published in the capitalist press, it
  was altogether superficial and concentrated on presenting the external features of the
  profound changes taking place in the working class.</p>

  <p>The study purported to give an analysis of the "evolution of work." But it evaded
  the crux of the matter. There is work and work. There has been work over the ages, if
  one seeks to go to the roots of its evolution. There's work today both at home and in
  the mines, mills, factories and offices.</p>

  <p>If one prepares one's meals at home, repairs an appliance or a broken door or paints
  the apartment or house, that is work. But work in the plants, in mines and mills, has
  to be especially differentiated, even though the scientific-technological revolution
  may have affected both. What differentiates this work from that at home is not so much
  the physical differences, important as they are, but that the labor process in the
  mines, mills, factories and offices takes on a special character--that of the
  <strong>exploitation of wage labor by capital.</strong></p>

  <p>The study used the term "work" but disregarded the special social characteristic
  which distinguishes the labor process in the workplace of the employer from that at
  home. It attempted to analyze work independent of social relationships, which are based
  on class antagonisms.</p>

  <p>The study mostly confined itself to the last two decades. This period, it said, has
  undergone a scientific-technological revolution every bit as significant as the
  Industrial Revolution. If it is that deep and profound, and we agree that it is, it
  certainly deserves greater scrutiny.</p>

  <p>The phrase scientific-technological revolution has been used so frequently in and
  out of context by bourgeois sociologists that it has become a cliche. Furthermore,
  trade unionists should note that those who have cheered loudest for the technological
  revolution have also jeered the most at the labor movement over these last years.</p>

  <p>To examine the relationship between the technological revolution and the Industrial
  Revolution, one must go beyond the framework set by bourgeois sociologists. For trade
  unions in particular it is necessary to view it from the perspective of the working
  class as against that of the bourgeoisie and its cheerleaders.</p>

  <p>In fact, no one better described the revolutionary achievements of the bourgeoisie
  in the Industrial Revolution which brought it to power than Karl Marx. Conversely,
  almost all bourgeois historians will point out this or that aspect of the devastating
  effects the Industrial Revolution had on the workers. But then, of course, they will
  praise to the skies its achievements for the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Aside from all the cruelties and inhuman treatment of the workers, however, there is
  an instructive aspect of the Industrial Revolution which is particularly relevant to
  the effects the technological revolution today is having on the contemporary working
  class.</p>

  <h3>Destructive social impact of revolutions in technology</h3>

  <p>In <em>Capital,</em> Marx fully described how the basis for the Industrial
  Revolution was the expropriation of the land from the peasants and their concentration
  into factories. That was part of the process that undermined the feudal system, which
  stood in the way of the bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>The Industrial Revolution destroyed the feudal labor guilds, the first known labor
  organizations. These guilds had contained both masters and craftsmen or journeymen. It
  was these independent craftsmen of the feudal period, members of the guilds, who were
  then drawn or herded into the plants and factories, lost their status as independent
  producers and were reduced along with the peasants to the status of wage workers, of
  proletarians.</p>

  <p>The current scientific-technological revolution, viewed from a trade union point of
  view (which is often completely ignored), is having every bit as significant an impact
  on the labor movement as the Industrial Revolution had on the first known labor
  organizations. Its tendency is not to demolish the unions per se but to swallow them
  up, bring them into the fold of so-called labor-management cooperation.</p>

  <p>Therefore the destructive effect of the scientific-technological revolution upon the
  working class and particularly upon the unions has to be seen in the light of
  historical evolution.</p>

  <p>It was the historic mission of the Industrial Revolution to bring together the
  scattered handicrafts, formerly the work of independent craftsmen and apprentice
  workers, and develop large-scale industry. It was a bloody process, but this
  large-scale production laid the basis for the creation of the modern working class, the
  modern proletariat. It was by such ruthless measures (the "evolution of work") that it
  came into existence.</p>

  <p>This process was not without sporadic struggles of the workers. To the extent that
  these very early forms of workers' struggle are given any attention at all by the
  bourgeoisie, they do so in a derogatory manner, leaving out the essential lesson.</p>

  <p>Luddites is a name frequently given to English workers who staged a series of
  uprisings between 1811 and 1816. These struggles began in Nottinghamshire, where groups
  of textile workers began to destroy knitting machines. They spread later to Lancashire,
  Cheshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Workers began to wreck cotton power looms
  and shearing machines. They had no coherent plan, no general aims and no political
  orientation.</p>

  <p>This movement was of a thoroughly spontaneous character and was an expression of
  frustration. It was not ignorance as such which led to these wrecking and sabotage
  tactics. What it demonstrated was the organizational immaturity of the workers at that
  time, but also the character the class struggle can assume in the absence of a trade
  union that can respond to the needs and aspirations of the workers.</p>

  <p>Marx said about the Luddites: "It took both time and experience before the
  workpeople learnt to distinguish between machinery and its employment by capital, and
  to direct their attacks, not against the material instruments of production, but
  against the mode in which they are used."<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>

  <p>It is very interesting that this form of struggle should be cropping up again today,
  and in a country which is supposed to be in the advance guard of the technological
  revolution, with all its highly touted "benefits" for the workers.</p>

  <p>We are referring to the situation of the Japanese railroad workers. Few labor
  movements are more affected by the scientific-technological revolution. The Japanese
  government wants to split up the national railway and return the railroads to private
  industry, with the projected loss of 100,000 jobs, or one-third of the total number of
  railway workers. (Isn't this what the U.S. government wants to do with Conrail and
  Amtrak?) When on November 29, 1985, the workers went on strike, organized bands of
  radicals dismantled railroad facilities in Tokyo, Osaka and other cities in an effort,
  however fruitless, to aid the striking workers.</p>

  <h3>Labor organization in different stages of capitalist production</h3>

  <p><strong>Manufacturing or handicrafts</strong></p>

  <p>The first stage in the development of the working class movement took place in the
  period of manufacturing or simple cooperation, which brought the handicrafts under one
  roof for the purpose of exploitation. It led to some technological development and a
  further division of labor.</p>

  <p>Manufacturing brought into one workplace the&nbsp;mechanical fitting together of
  partial products made independently. The final product owed its shape to a series of
  connected processes or manipulations. The manufacture of a watch illustrated this type
  of division of labor. The handicraft period of development left as a legacy such great
  inventions as the compass, gun powder, type printing and the watch. In that period
  machinery played a smaller, subordinate part.</p>

  <p>It was the manufacturing period that in fact produced the skill of the detail
  laborer. This was done by reproducing and even driving to a great extreme within the
  workshop what Marx called the "naturally developed differentiation of trades" which had
  already existed in society.</p>

  <p>While it developed great skill, it had its reactionary side. As Marx put it, "The
  conversion of fractional work into the life-calling of one man, corresponds to the
  tendency shown by earlier societies, to make trades hereditary; either to petrify them
  into castes, or . . . to ossify them into guilds."<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>
  &fnof; This is in very sharp contrast to the later period of the rise of capitalist
  development proper, which did not at all try to preserve and enrich the skills of the
  workers but relentlessly and mercilessly reduced them.</p>

  <p>The manufacturing period simplified, improved and multiplied the implements of labor
  by adapting them exclusively to special functions of each detail worker. (In the
  current stage of industrial development and technology, the detail laborer is reduced
  to the most minute, repetitive, monotonous operations requiring less and less
  adaptability and skill. The aim in fact is to abolish the worker altogether.)</p>

  <p>It was in the period of manufacture that the separation of the workers from their
  means of production and the conversion of their property, their means of production,
  into capital began.</p>

  <h4>The Industrial Revolution</h4>

  <p>The division of labor led eventually to the Industrial Revolution, or production
  based on the use of machinery. In the machine, wrote Marx, "we find . . . as a general
  rule, though often no doubt under very altered forms, the apparatus and tools used by
  the handicraftsmen or the manufacturing workmen, with this difference: that instead of
  being human implements they are the implements of a mechanism or a mechanical
  influence."&bdquo;<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>

  <p>The expansion of capitalist production by means of machinery was directly
  proportional to the number of workers whose independent means of livelihood gradually
  became destroyed by their inability to compete with the machinery.</p>

  <p>However, the use and development of machinery allowed the organization of
  large-scale production. Each step was accompanied by a rise in the productivity of
  labor, either through greater intensity in the use of labor power or through the
  introduction of labor-saving devices.</p>

  <p>All this laid the basis for the progressive development of the modern trade union
  movement. It is this second stage of capitalist production which gave a stimulus to the
  early development of the giant modern unions of today.</p>

  <h4>Mass production</h4>

  <p>Mass production, which began with what has been called the Ford Revolution, is the
  third stage. It further undermined the crafts and the skilled workers and created a new
  form, the so-called semi-skilled workers. Its merit was that it expanded the work
  force. The assembly line, which entailed the employment of more workers than ever, was
  considered the great accomplishment of Henry Ford.</p>

  <p>The difference between mass production and the earlier forms of large-scale
  production is that it brought about a greater simplification and division of labor into
  ever smaller tasks, finely delimited methods and more detailed specification and
  further reduced the variability of jobs. This is the significance of the assembly line,
  of mass production.</p>

  <h3>The current scientific-technological revolution</h3>

  <p>This stage has now given way to another phase of technological development. The mass
  production period which began with Ford and continued for a period of time after the
  Second World War was characterized by expansion. But the current stage, the
  scientific-technological stage, while continuing some of the earlier tendencies of
  development, contracts the workforce.</p>

  <p>Like all the previous stages of capitalist development, the current phase is based
  on the utilization of workers as labor power. But its whole tendency is to diminish the
  labor force while attempting to increase production. The technological revolution is
  therefore a quantum jump whose devastating effects require a revolutionary strategy to
  overcome.</p>

  <p>The division of labor in the early manufacturing stage built up and developed the
  skills of the workers to the point where they became hereditary. The process of true
  capitalist production, however, with the introduction of machinery, began to reduce the
  skills of that early division of labor, until in the current period they have
  introduced a micro-division of labor where the workers are more and more an appendage
  of the machine, instead of the machine being an instrument to develop the aptitude of
  the worker.</p>

  <p>Isn't this what Saturnization (the procedures to be introduced in GM's planned
  Saturn auto assembly plant in Tennessee, about which we'll have more to say later) is
  all about? It is hailed as ushering in a new period in labor relations where the
  workers, because of the further micro-division of labor and the introduction of
  computers and robotization, will have "less monotony" and "more variability" because
  they'll be doing more jobs. But in&nbsp;truth it means the wiping out of whole
  classifications of skills, the elimination of more workers and a greater rate of
  exploitation.</p>

  <p>The problem with the AFL-CIO study on the "evolution of work" is that it presents a
  mere description of the technological revolution. It alludes to what are in effect
  mechanical processes as though in a void, without showing the different stages in the
  evolution of the class struggle. It is as though one had nothing to do with the other,
  as though the technological revolution were not in essence a social process.</p>

  <p>The uninterrupted revolutions in science and technology which generally have gone by
  leaps and bounds in the modern era have now taken a quantum jump, producing a
  qualitative change. The technological revolution in relationship to the labor process,
  to the process of extracting profits from the workers, boils down to this: reducing
  their skills, displacing millions of workers and throwing them on the unemployment
  rolls.</p>

  <p>When bourgeois sociologists refer to the scientific-technological revolution as a
  structural change, they are not including but are really excluding the social changes,
  the changes in class relations which are the result of the technological revolution.
  The latter is the cause of the former, not vice versa.</p>

  <p>It is these so-called structural changes, these very deep and abiding technological
  revolutions, which have caused havoc and disorientation in the perspective of
  millions&nbsp;of workers and their unions. Clearly the trade unions,&nbsp;indeed the
  whole labor movement, have reached an historic turning point.</p>

  <h3>Turning point for labor movement</h3>

  <p>Some of the bourgeois ideologists are beginning to view the industrial
  infrastructure of the U.S., built over decades and decades of capitalist development,
  as a dinosaur. They are giving voice to the thinking in ruling class circles which
  likens&nbsp;the industrial infrastructure of the U.S. to huge ocean&nbsp;liners which
  should perhaps be broken up into the small ships and frigates of long ago--but based on
  the introduction of Saturn-type technology and above all Saturn-type labor
  relations.</p>

  <p>What we are witnessing, therefore, is the wholesale dismantling of plants which
  began much longer than a decade ago and is now in full swing. All this propaganda about
  eliminating the "dinosaurs" and breaking the "ocean liners" into small vessels is meant
  to facilitate the abandonment of the huge steel mills, textile plants and other
  complexes for "mini-mills" which can reap "maxi-profits." It's a line of development
  which threatens the very existence of the unions.</p>

  <p>It has also upset and undermined the traditional labor relations approach of the
  unions. The attempt of the bosses to introduce a "new type of labor relations," a
  "nonconfrontational" kind of "friendly cooperation" between management and labor where
  decision-making power is supposedly granted to the workers, is nothing more than a new
  despotism of the bosses meant to accelerate profits, reduce costs and introduce an
  unprecedented era of permanent displacement and enlargement of the unemployed
  rolls.</p>

  <p>The remorseless and relentless trend of barbarously dismantling whole plants and
  industrial complexes does not by any means negate the scientific-technological
  revolution but on the contrary will intensify it. The breakup into smaller units (like
  mini-mills and so on) is not a progressive trend, as some in the camp of bourgeois
  sociology see it, toward small businesses or the dissolution of the monopolies and
  oligarchies. That is a ridiculous conclusion based on utterly false assumptions.</p>

  <p>The trend toward small high-tech units is financed by the huge banks, the source of
  the recent wave of buyouts, corporate reorganizations and dissolutions. The net result
  is the further concentration of the wealth in fewer hands and strengthened monopoly. As
  even the liberal economist Lester Thurow has pointed out, only 1% of the population
  owns 48% of the stock in this country, and the rest is not owned by the workers except
  for a small, utterly insignificant sprinkling.</p>

  <p>In all earlier phases of capitalist production, beginning with simple cooperation,
  the tendency had been to concentrate larger and larger numbers of workers under one
  roof or in contiguous areas. In the latest phase of development, however, there is the
  deliberate dispersal of the large concentrations of workers into widely spread
  geographical areas. Often this is not necessarily for immediate economic gain,
  especially by the huge multinational corporations, but for broad social and political
  reasons.</p>

  <p>Large concentrations of workers are more susceptible to union organization and are
  more affected by the "contagion" of progressive, militant ideas. The other aspect is
  pure and simple racism--to get away from the areas of the country where oppressed
  people especially are concentrated. The Pentagon is a principal promoter of this.</p>

  <p>The AFL-CIO study mentions "unstable labor conditions" but does not recognize the
  great importance in all this, that the technological revolution has broken up the old
  mold of labor relations.</p>

  <p>The workers and their unions are trapped in an historic labor relations framework at
  a time when the structure of capitalist industry has undergone a wholesale
  transformation. This is to the great advantage of the ruling class, the bosses and
  bankers who own and control the industry, and to the tremendous disadvantage of the
  workers who have produced the industrial infrastructure, who laid the first bricks,
  forged the iron and steel, hammered in the first nails and have mastered it all, up to
  and including the very summits of the most sophisticated high technology.</p>

  <p>There is no question that these changes constitute a revolutionary development which
  requires the development of a corresponding revolutionary strategy. It is required not
  only for the further development of a working class offensive to meet the anti-labor
  offensive of the bosses, but for the sheer survival of the trade union movement.</p>

  <p>The great necessity is to reverse the anti-labor offensive. New forms of struggle
  are necessary.</p>
