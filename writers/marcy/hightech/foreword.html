  <hr />

  <h1>Foreword</h1>

  <p>This study is an elaboration of a thesis developed in a memorandum on "The Changed
  Character of the Working Class" written in the summer of 1984 and submitted for
  publication to <em>Workers World</em> newspaper in October 1984.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
  At that time we said that high technology, that is, the
  scientific-technological revolution, had become such an enormous economic factor that
  it had changed the social composition of the U.S. working class.</p>

  <p>The basic content of the change has been a massive general shift of the workers away
  from relatively high-skilled, high-paid jobs into lower-skilled, lower-paid service
  jobs. Because of this shift, the social weight of the lower-skilled, lower-paid
  workers, made up mostly of Black and Latin people and women, has become preponderant in
  the general workforce of the U.S.</p>

  <p>At the time of that writing there was already abundant data to confirm our general
  analysis. It may have appeared, however, that the data was still of only a tentative
  and conditional character and therefore inconclusive.</p>

  <p>However, a new flood of statistics based on studies of not only the 1980 U.S. census
  but updated reports since then has lent further support to our thesis. One of these
  valuable studies to which we refer later is by Ward Morehouse and David Dembo of the
  Council on International and Public Affairs and includes a series of special reports,
  the first written in October 1984 under the title "The Underbelly of the U.S. Economy:
  Joblessness and Pauperization of Work in America."<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>
  &sbquo; These studies were also bolstered by a United Auto Workers (UAW) Research
  Bulletin of May-June 1985.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>

  <p>Finally, an official report issued February 6, 1986, by the U.S. Congressional
  Office of Technology Assessment fully confirms our analysis. While the full study
  containing some 450 pages of data was not available at the time of the writing of this
  book, abundant excerpts were published in many newspapers throughout the
  country.<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>

  <p>A principal finding of this report was that in the five years from 1979 to 1984 as
  many as 11.5 million workers either lost their jobs or shifted to lower-paying service
  jobs. "Nearly half of all workers displaced from 1979 to 1984 worked in manufacturing
  industries such as steel, auto, industrial equipment, textiles and apparel. [As many
  as] 45% have taken a pay cut and two-thirds of those were earning less than 80% of
  their former income." The report went on to state, "Given the pace of technological and
  structural economic change, [many more workers] may be left behind."</p>

  <p>With regard to the nature of the shift away from the heavy industries, the report
  said that 95% of the new jobs created in the period studied were lower-paid service
  jobs. In 1984, the report said, the average hourly wage in manufacturing was $9.18.
  However, the average hourly wage for production and non-supervisory workers in all
  service-producing sectors was $7.52. It would be correct to assume that the gap between
  the higher wage scale and the lower ones has since widened and not narrowed.</p>

  <p>This is a social trend wholly unanticipated by those who had expected the great
  advances and discoveries in science and technology to have brought about "upward
  mobility." This is what was looked for from the scientific and technological
  revolution. Instead, all of the studies disclose a clear trend in the opposite
  direction.</p>

  <p>Instead of raising the level of Black, Latin, women and other oppressed workers in
  capitalist society to that of the higher paid, more privileged, so-called aristocratic
  sector of workers, the scientific-technological revolution is mercilessly and
  ruthlessly leveling down and demolishing the higher social stratum in the working class
  and reducing it to the level of the lower paid.</p>

  <p>While the apologists for the ruling class are celebrating this new condition of the
  working class, they stop short at drawing the deeper social and political significance
  it has for the process of the newly emerging social composition of the working class.
  The growing demolition of vast sections of highly paid workers and their sinking to the
  level of the more oppressed sections spells out a new constellation of internal forces
  in the working class. It will, for one thing, fundamentally alter the relationship
  between Black and white workers.</p>

  <p>This developing relationship bodes ill for capitalist apologists because it
  discloses a new material basis for classwide solidarity and even a revolutionary
  potential for the working class. The new composition of the working class will give it
  a more homogeneous character and limit greatly the racist, hierarchical stratification
  upon which the ruling class has been able to thrive and which it has cultivated and
  promoted all these years.</p>

  <p>It will inevitably shift the political balance away from the more privileged layers
  of the working class in favor of the hitherto underprivileged, unrepresented and more
  scattered oppressed workers. The internal political relations between the different
  strata of the working class will become more harmonized on the level of working class
  politics. This new trend in the working class goes contrary to the historical tendency
  of capitalist development in the past.</p>

  <p>The scientific-technological revolution is a truly global phenomenon and should not
  be assessed solely on the basis of its national manifestation in the U.S. Its influence
  stretches from one end of the globe to the other. Its effects can be felt in Tokyo and
  Sweden, in France and Mexico, all over the globe. (Its development in the socialist
  countries is not the object of our study here.)</p>

  <p>It is a phenomenon that cannot be reversed. Those who bemoan its existence today
  must look to the future, not to a return to the past, which in any case is
  impossible.</p>

  <p>Of course, it is possible for the growth of the productive forces, of science and
  technology, to slow down and possibly stagnate, as happened in the period immediately
  after the great economic crisis of the early 1930s. Even then, however, research and
  development continued, if at a slower pace. But what was developed slowly in the
  laboratories at that time took on a feverish momentum once the buildup began for the
  Second World War.</p>

  <p>It is wrong to underestimate high technology by viewing it as only a narrow sector
  of the economy. This was the conclusion of the study by the United Auto Workers (UAW)
  research department printed in the May-June 1985 Research Bulletin and referred to
  earlier: "High-tech firms represent only a small portion of our economy and with high
  projected growth fewer than a million jobs are likely to be created in the next decade
  in high-tech firms."</p>

  <p>That may be true enough. The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment report
  confirmed it: "Jobs in computer and semiconductor manufacturing are unlikely to rescue
  many workers from traditional manufacturing jobs because employment in these industries
  is small." And of course, the total number of jobs in computer and semiconductor
  industries is small by comparison with the overall workforce, which counts in the tens
  of millions.</p>

  <p>But this is an evasion of the fundamental issue involved in the
  scientific-technological revolution. While it is a very narrow sector, its influence is
  decisive for all sectors of the economy.</p>

  <p>These technological changes alter fundamental social trends and bring to the fore
  new political forces. It is therefore wholly inadequate to point to the mere number of
  workers directly involved in this particular narrow sector without showing its
  overwhelming influence in all phases of the capitalist economy. Moreover, high
  technology has fueled the enormous growth of the military-industrial complex.</p>

  <p>It need only be recalled that in July 1985 the heretofore leading civilian
  corporation, General Motors, acquired Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and its computer
  services. The whole purpose was to acquire high technology and move this civilian
  sector of the economy closer to the military-industrial complex. Even such a homespun
  company as Singer Sewing Machine, a household name for decades, as of February 1986
  abandoned the business of manufacturing sewing machines by announcing that it would
  dismantle its plants (at who knows what cost to the workers) and move completely into
  the aerospace industry. Now its only connection to sewing machines will be the
  marketing of "Singer" machines made by other companies.</p>

  <p>The justification for each new social system as against its predecessor is that it
  raises society to a higher level. It has done so in each succeeding social order by
  raising the productivity of labor. The great achievement of capitalism was that it not
  only promoted a tempestuous development of the productive forces, of science and
  invention on an unheard-of scale, but it raised the productivity of labor. Over a
  period of centuries it laid the basis for raising the material standards of society and
  the wage levels of the working class as a whole.</p>

  <p>The distinctive feature of this particular phase of capitalist development, the
  scientific-technological phase, is that while it enormously raises the productivity of
  labor, it for the first time simultaneously lowers the general wage patterns and
  demolishes the more high-skilled, high-paid workers. It enhances the general
  pauperization of the population.</p>

  <p>At a time when the ruling class is boasting of capitalist prosperity, the two
  independent studies already cited, one by the UAW Research Department and the other by
  the Council on International and Public Affairs, have confirmed that halfway through
  the 1980s there were more than 15.6 million unemployed and underemployed (unemployed,
  discouraged and part-time workers). How is it possible for there to be so-called
  capitalist prosperity and the addition of millions of workers to the workforce, as the
  Reagan administration boasts, and at the same time an expanding pool of unprecedented
  numbers of unemployed?</p>

  <p>The reason lies deep in the objective process of capitalist production. The latter
  even in its most prosperous phase of the capitalist economic cycle continually expels
  more and more workers from the productive apparatus. The difference introduced by the
  scientific-technological revolution is simply that it has vastly accelerated this
  continuous expulsion of more and more workers from the process of production, even in a
  period of so-called growth.</p>

  <p>No one knows what the economic situation will be once the economic cycle of
  development progresses, as it eventually will, from the so-called prosperous phase to
  crisis to economic collapse. This explains why the ruling class, which has been so
  lyrical about the huge profits it is garnering, is at the same time so worried about
  future developments.</p>

  <p>This latest phase in the development of capitalism has to be seen in the light of
  its evolution of more than a half century and the role of the U.S. in the global
  economy at the end of the Second World War. At that time this country held a
  predominant position in both science and technology. It controlled the fundamental
  levers of capitalist development in the West and had gained political and diplomatic
  predominance over Japan.</p>

  <p>Over the years, however, the fortunes of U.S. monopoly capitalism began to change.
  From shortly after the Second World War until the early 1950s, the U.S. had accounted
  for 50% of gross world production (that is, of the global bourgeois economy), which
  gave it enormous political, diplomatic and military leverage. However, as capitalist
  Europe recovered and Washington began to become very deeply involved in the Viet Nam
  adventure, the U.S. share&nbsp;of the capitalist world's gross production sank to
  what&nbsp;is variously estimated at 25% to 30%. It somewhat recovered for a short time
  after the war, but has since been&nbsp;steadily shrinking, so that estimates today run
  between&nbsp;20% and 25%.</p>

  <p>While the U.S. share of the capitalist world's gross production has declined, its
  military aspect has continually increased. This has imparted a debilitating aspect to
  the nature of capitalist development in this period. The figures show that the military
  expansion of the U.S. has been contemporaneous with a contracting share of world
  capitalist production. This is an enormous factor in imparting economic instability and
  promoting military adventurism.</p>

  <p>It is thus impossible to discuss the effects of the scientific-technological
  revolution solely in terms of a national phenomenon. In the following pages we examine
  the havoc wrought by this technological transformation on the labor movement and the
  oppressed people. However, it is the international implications which often prove of
  decisive significance, especially in terms of the relationship of military production
  to the world capitalist economy and the relations of U.S. imperialism to the oppressed
  peoples and socialist countries of the world. All this has to be borne in mind as we
  discuss strategy and tactics in the labor movement.</p>

  <p>While it would be incorrect to try and draw an analogy between the fall of the
  ancient empires based on chattel slavery and the declining position today of U.S.
  imperialism, nevertheless certain similarities are worthy of comment. You just have to
  look at the rebellions going on in the Philippines, South Africa, Haiti, south Korea
  and elsewhere to be reminded of those ancient uprisings of the colonized peoples
  against the empire.</p>

  <p>As in those days, there are loud voices in the ruling class today calling for strong
  leadership, for imposing order on the world. They were most vociferous during the
  Carter administration, which they viewed as well-nigh traitorous for not being able to
  prevent the downfall of the shah of Iran. But in truth, the Reaganites, who were behind
  so much of that ultra-rightwing agitation, found once they got in that they were forced
  by the rebellions to carry out pretty much the same policy as Carter. Reagan had to get
  rid of Duvalier of Haiti and to cut loose the dictator of the Philippines, Marcos.</p>

  <p>For all the tough talk of the Reagan administration, the only place they dared carry
  out an open military intervention was against Grenada. That would have been an easy
  victory 150 years ago.</p>

  <p>The cost of militarism is rising. The trend in imperialism today is that the cost of
  maintaining the empire is beginning to overwhelm the loot that is brought in. When
  imperialism was stronger it brought in many more profits than losses. This allowed for
  the development of a relatively aristocratic top layer of the working class, mostly
  white, who gained something from imperialist expansionism. But today it is becoming
  ever more costly to maintain such a far-flung empire against increasingly conscious and
  determined liberation struggles. It takes enormous expenditures not only on the most
  sophisticated weapons and on maneuvers involving huge numbers of troops but even on
  endless diplomatic and political efforts. All this must ultimately come out of the
  hides of the workers here.</p>

  <p>Seen in another sense, the imperialist system is becoming too costly to be able to
  reproduce itself. This stands out when capitalism is compared to both ancient slavery
  and feudalism, societies that remained relatively stable for centuries. Under these
  systems, the surplus produced by the laboring classes went directly into consumption.
  Very little was used to expand the means of production, unlike the present economic
  system, where the driving force of production is to generate capital.</p>

  <p>Under modern-day monopoly capitalism, with its enormous and costly military
  superstructure and its irreversible drive to revolutionize the means of production, the
  cost of production has become excessive. The capitalists must make an ever greater
  effort to unload these excessive costs on the working class; hence, high tech and low
  wages. Their anti-labor offensive is not the product of an aberration on the part of
  individual capitalists but comes from deep historical roots. It is a symptom showing
  that the system is economically out of date and bound to decline.</p>

  <p>At present the anti-labor offensive of the capitalist class shows no signs of
  receding. But it is instructive to look back to a hundred years ago, when the struggle
  of the working class in the U.S. was remarkable for its militancy. The international
  working class of that period viewed the struggles of the U.S. workers as exemplary. The
  struggle of U.S. workers for the eight-hour day in 1886 led to the proclamation of May
  Day as an international working class holiday. That historic period of upsurge also saw
  the rise of the organization of Black labor.</p>

  <p>However, it should be noted that it was preceded by a period of a severe anti-labor
  offensive unleashed by the capitalist class that had its origins in the capitalist
  crisis of 1873. Labor historian Mary Beard, in her <em>A Short History of American
  Labor,</em> described the period: "With the paralysis of industry employers began to
  reduce wages and these reductions were followed by prolonged and desperate strikes.
  Within seven years, between 1873 and 1880, wages in the textile districts were cut to
  almost one-half the former standard. Similar action was taken in other industries.
  Unemployment became so widespread that strikes to maintain wages were perilous; where
  they were attempted, lockouts usually followed. Blacklists and prosecutions intimidated
  labor leaders. . . ."<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> The number of effective national
  craft unions fell to less than a third, and membership in unions declined
  drastically.</p>

  <p>Is this really different, except perhaps for form and severity, from the current
  attack on the labor movement, the oppressed people, women, gay men and lesbians and the
  homeless? That period led to a great resurgence. The devastating effects of monopoly
  capitalism's latest assault will, after trials and errors, inevitably give birth to an
  upsurge in the movement of the working class and oppressed peoples--and one which has
  incalculable potential for progressive and revolutionary working class solidarity.</p>
