  <h3>Chapter 7</h3>

  <h1>Native People Under the Gun</h1>

  <h3>Gunpowder and mass production of firearms</h3>

  <p>The scientific-technological revolution has had the most devastating effect on the
  Native people of North America. The campaigns of extermination and plunder conducted by
  the North and South could scarcely have assumed the proportions they did had it not
  been for the weapons of destruction the settlers and colonizers brought with them.</p>

  <p>As is well known, gunpowder had revolutionized warfare throughout Europe. Although
  first developed in China in the 9th and 10th centuries, it was not used as an explosive
  for military purposes on a wide scale until the 15th century in Europe. The bow and
  arrow and other earlier weapons could not compete with firearms.</p>

  <p>The French had developed the most devastating form of gunpowder, superior to that
  originally used here by the English-speaking settlers. It was the DuPonts who brought
  the production of this more powerful type of gunpowder to the New World.</p>

  <p>Much has been written about the early settlers and how they employed their guns,
  especially the Kentucky long-barreled rifles, in hunting squirrels and rabbits for
  food. But in reality these weapons were used mainly to terrorize the Native people and
  rob them of their land.</p>

  <p>What gave the new ruling class its greatest advantage in the struggle against the
  Native people, however, and for that matter against all the oppressed and exploited,
  were the technological advances in the production of arms. The bourgeois state, no
  matter how much it is prettified, is basically an instrument of repression.</p>

  <p>Eli Whitney, whom we mentioned earlier as the inventor of the cotton gin, also
  introduced into the U.S. a new principle in the production of arms. He originated the
  use of interchangeable parts for machines and their products, in other words, the first
  elements of mass production. This was over 100 years before Henry Ford got together the
  capital to apply this technique to the mass production of automobiles.</p>

  <p>"When [Whitney] decided to undertake the manufacture of firearms for the U.S.
  government, he introduced a new principle--one destined to revolutionize production
  methods as his gin had revolutionized the social structure of the South, namely the use
  of interchangeable parts for tools, for machinery and for their products."<sup><a href=
  "#fn1" id="ref1" name="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>As early as 1798, Whitney's principle began to supplant individual gunsmiths with
  factories for the manufacture of firearms. In order to have interchangeable parts,
  firearms now had to be standardized. As Whitney himself said, he had to "substitute
  correct and effective operations of machinery for that skill of an artist which is
  acquired only by long practice and experience." This required making the same parts of
  different guns "as much like each other as the successive impressions of a copper plate
  engraving."<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>

  <p>All this required the division of labor and the transfer of human skills to special
  tools and machinery. It took two years to produce and install the necessary machines,
  after which the production of muskets could proceed on a mass scale. This is what then
  enabled the European colonizers to defeat the Native people in an unequal struggle.</p>

  <p>The standardization of arms production was a very early precursor to the development
  of the military-industrial complex in the epoch of imperialist wars. When Whitney
  developed his principle of interchangeable parts, there were no factories for arms
  production, only individual gunsmiths. However, he persuaded President Thomas Jefferson
  of the utility of his idea and was able to obtain a contract for the production of
  10,000 muskets. He then built an armory in New Haven, Connecticut, to produce this
  large number of weapons. It was thus the state that was instrumental in revolutionizing
  this industry from an inefficient, individual enterprise into a much more collective
  form of production. This helped to bolster the repressive power of the state as it
  struggled against the oppressed and exploited masses.</p>

  <p>The earlier, handcrafted guns had of course been much more expensive. The new
  principle of incipient mass production enabled the U.S. government to equip large
  armies and expand the militia. This inglorious aspect of the scientific-technological
  revolution is frequently neglected by historians, as though the settlers had been born
  with weapons of destruction.</p>

  <h3>Expansion of slave plantations onto Native land</h3>

  <p>Both Northern capitalists and Southern slaveowners learned early on that,
  notwithstanding the very fundamental and irreconcilable contradictions between them,
  they nevertheless had a common objective in the suppression of the exploited and
  oppressed masses.</p>

  <p>The expansion of slavery, which we have shown was largely due to increased cotton
  production, gave even more impetus to the drive to oust the Native people from their
  land. A path had to be cleared for the expanding plantations, and that meant expelling
  the Native people from areas where they had lived from time immemorial.</p>

  <p>We mentioned earlier how every year the liberals in the Democratic Party pay tribute
  to Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson as great democrats and men of the people. They
  don't mention that Jefferson was a racist and large slaveowner, as we said. The
  historian Arthur Schlesinger, viewed as a great liberal chronicler, wrote a book on
  <em>The Age of Jackson</em> which viewed the progressive era of Franklin Roosevelt as
  an extension of Jacksonian democracy. But Jackson's role in the extermination campaigns
  against Native people needs to be mentioned here.</p>

  <p>General Andrew Jackson was one of the most vicious enemies of the Native people, and
  participated in campaigns to drive them out of their homes in Georgia, Alabama,
  Mississippi, Tennessee and Florida, all in the interests of expanding the slave
  plantations. His demand from the Creek nation in 1814 that they yield 23 million acres
  of their ancient domain was described by an early historian as "unequaled for
  exorbitance."<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>

  <p>His move from military to civilian politics had no softening effect on Jackson.
  "Later, when he became President, Jackson finished the job on the Creeks, Cherokees,
  Seminoles, and others. He forced them off their Southern preserves altogether and
  across the Mississippi River in 1835. They were finally rounded up, stripped of their
  hunting grounds, and confined in concentration camps known as Indian reservations. . .
  . The big planters got the cream of the wide and fertile Southern lands stolen from the
  Indians by the government."<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>

  <p>Any idea that contemporary imperialism has become more moderate and enlightened and
  less predatory toward Native people is dispelled by taking a careful look at how the
  U.S. government and the multinational corporations, especially the huge energy
  monopolies, deal with the rights of Native people today.</p>

  <p>It took a virtual uprising at Wounded Knee in 1973 for the struggle of Native people
  to finally gain some kind of national recognition. But the desperate conditions
  highlighted in that heroic struggle continue to persist around the country today. Many
  of the leaders of that period have been assassinated or imprisoned. One of the most
  prominent, Leonard Peltier, has gained international support as an eminent political
  prisoner, but remains virtually unmentioned in the imperialist press of the U.S.</p>

  <p>The government in cahoots with the energy monopolies is trying to force the
  relocation of the Dineh (Navajo) and Hopi peoples from their mineral-rich lands in
  Arizona. High unemployment, infant mortality, suicide and alcoholism on the
  reservations all attest to a ruthless disregard of the sovereign rights of the Native
  people.</p>

  <h3>Mass migrations from Europe and the Utopians</h3>

  <p>It was to try and achieve basic democratic rights that many millions came to the New
  World, fleeing the injustice, cruelty and oppression of the European regimes. However,
  these migrations, often spurred on by the breakup of the old feudal order, never took
  into account the rights of the indigenous people.</p>

  <p>The character of this migration became a matter of sharp debate in the socialist
  movement in Europe, even though the controversy did not center on the question of the
  indigenous people, but rather on the idea that a socialist utopia could be established
  in the New World, a view that Marx rejected.</p>

  <p>Frederick Engels in his celebrated work <em>Socialism, Utopian and
  Scientific</em><sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> examined the ideas of the great utopian
  socialists, from Thomas Moore and Saint-Simon to Robert Owen and Fourier. These early
  social reformers envisioned a variety of communal societies that would abolish class
  distinctions and bring about justice and equality. As Engels demonstrated, however,
  their experiments were bound to come to a sad end because they disregarded or were
  unable to see the development of the class struggle between the working class and the
  bourgeoisie, which is the driving force of modern society.</p>

  <p>While they lacked a scientific analysis of class society, and could not see that the
  working class would replace the bourgeoisie only through a thoroughgoing socialist
  revolution, these early utopian socialists nevertheless made a contribution to what
  would later be developed by both Marx and Engels into a scientific, revolutionary
  socialist theory.</p>

  <p>These early utopian socialists, however, must be distinguished from a variety of
  others who came along later when there was less justification for their erroneous views
  and who in fact were harmful to the developing workers' movement. We particularly are
  referring here to those who saw the Western Hemisphere as a land of great opportunity
  to build a free socialist society on the basis of mass migration from Europe. It
  appears that never for a moment did these utopians inquire as to the rights or even the
  existence of the Native people in making their calculations.</p>

  <p>Marx took a dim view of mass migration as a panacea for building a socialist
  society. A young man named Hermann Kriege, who had worked with Marx for a short time,
  went to America and started a journal "for the propaganda of communism." But, says
  Lenin in an essay on this question,<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> "he conducted this
  propaganda in such a manner that Marx was obliged to protest very strongly."</p>

  <p>Kriege had said in his journal that "If this immense area (the 1,400,000,000 acres
  of North American public domain) is withdrawn from commerce and is secured in
  restricted amounts for labor, an end will be put to poverty in America at one stroke. .
  . ." Marx had replied, "And who are the Europeans whose 'dreams' would thus come true?
  Not the communist workers, but bankrupt shopkeepers and handicraftsmen, or ruined
  cottars, who yearn for the good fortune of once again becoming petty bourgeois. . . .
  And what is the 'dream' that is to be fulfilled by means of these 1,400,000,000 acres?
  No other than that all men be converted into private owners, a dream which is as
  unrealizable and as communistic as the dream to convert all men into emperors, kings,
  and popes."</p>

  <p>Although in this article Marx didn't refer to the Native population, in
  <em>Capital</em> he denounced the "extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of
  the aboriginal population" in America which, together with the looting of the East
  Indies and the slave trade in Africa, signaled "the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist
  production."<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup></p>

  <p>When Marx answered Kriege, he was himself only 28 years old and had not yet fully
  developed the views which were to appear as matured Marxism in such later works as the
  <em>Communist Manifesto</em> and <em>The Poverty of Philosophy.</em></p>

  <p>Reactionary schemes of utopian socialism continued to plague the socialist movement
  almost until the turn of the century. Thus, in June 1897, when the railway union headed
  by Eugene V. Debs merged with the Social Democracy then being formed in Chicago,
  "leading the list of the Social Democracy's demands was the colonization plan which
  proposed to establish a socialist America by organizing a mass migration to a Western
  state, where cooperative colonies would be formed, from which the movement would spread
  throughout the nation and in due time create a socialist United States."<sup><a href=
  "#fn8">8</a></sup></p>

  <p>What is striking about this and all other mass migration plans in the Western
  Hemisphere, particularly in the U.S., is that there was no recognition whatever of the
  rights of the indigenous people, whose land was to be appropriated.</p>

  <p>Later a new wing of socialists more attuned to the teachings of Marx, as then
  understood and practiced in the U.S., gained greater influence in the Social Democratic
  organization. The colonization scheme was ditched and a split with these utopian
  socialists took place. However, in all this the criticism against the utopian
  socialists was based on the fantastic and impractical character of their schemes, not
  that the land was to be appropriated from the Native people. Moreover, this was a time
  when the cruelest oppression of the indigenous people was taking place.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the inevitability of capitalist development and its triumph over
  previous modes of production, Engels paid a great deal of attention to the findings of
  Lewis Henry Morgan, who learned first-hand about the social organization of Native
  peoples in North America. The significance of Morgan's findings, which confirmed the
  existence of natural communism and pre-class society, was brought to light in Engels'
  famous work, <em>The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State,</em> which
  was subtitled, <em>In the Light of the Researches of Lewis H. Morgan.</em><sup><a href=
  "#fn9">9</a></sup></p>

  <p>Marx, too, was enthused by Morgan's discoveries about the communal society of the
  Iroquois people, and wrote to a comrade in 1881 that the crisis of capitalism would
  only end "with its abolition, with the return of modern societies to the 'archaic' type
  of communal ownership, or, as an American author [Morgan] . . . says--the new system
  toward which modern society is tending 'will be a revival of the archaic societal type
  in a superior form.' One should not be frightened overmuch by the word 'archaic.'
  "<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup></p>

  <h3>Leninist stand on national oppression</h3>

  <p>It was not until the arrival of Lenin on&nbsp;the historical scene, however, that
  the whole question of national oppression, including that of Native people in this
  country, began to be taken note of by white progressive and working class
  organizations. It is a cornerstone of Leninism that socialism cannot coexist with
  national oppression; genuine socialist internationalism can only be achieved through
  the recognition of the sovereign rights of oppressed people. This is particularly true
  of the indigenous peoples, who have been uprooted around the globe, not just in North
  America.</p>

  <p>The task of a revolutionary workers' party here is to promote the sovereign rights
  of the Native peoples. Some white progressives seem to worry about how this can be done
  in light of the advance of capitalist development, whether such a stand wouldn't mean
  turning back the wheel of history altogether. They would do better to think about how
  to fight imperialism's aggressiveness and predatory monopoly character.</p>

  <p>The broad progressive movement has unfortunately had for its heroes men like
  Senators George McGovern of South Dakota and Morris Udall of Arizona, for many years
  two of the most luminous stars in the liberal firmament. But what about their record in
  relation to Native people, who have significant concentrations in both states? They are
  not heroes but rather the executors of the same old policy of colonial conquest. And
  when both men have run for President, they haven't so much as mentioned Native
  people.</p>

  <p>The right of Native peoples to choose their own form of self-determination,
  including sovereignty, has not found its way into the programmatic demands of many
  working class tendencies in this country. Many who never give a second thought to how
  "practical" it may be for the U.S. to have annexed as its fiftieth state the group of
  Hawaiian islands far off in the Pacific are quick to declaim on the "impracticality" of
  sovereignty for the Native peoples because of the modern industrial development of
  capitalism.</p>

  <p>Yet it has proven very practical in the USSR for a variety of forms of
  self-determination to be exercised by the indigenous peoples there, who belong to many
  different autonomous republics and regions. From Central Asia to the Soviet Near East
  to Siberia, there are many Soviet peoples who are not Russian and who since the
  Revolution have harmonized the development of their regions with their cultures and
  needs.</p>

  <p>As we have shown, the effects of the scientific-technological revolution are more
  onerous on oppressed peoples. A very firm and clear stand on the rights of Native
  peoples and all oppressed nationalities is therefore of utmost importance for the
  working class vanguard in all propaganda and political activity.</p>
