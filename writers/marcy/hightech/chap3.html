  <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

  <h1>The Ups and Downs of the Capitalist Economy</h1>

  <h3>How cyclical crises affect trade unions</h3>

  <p>It should be recognized that trade unions are a limited form of organization. This
  does not mean that they are limited to only taking up purely economic tasks arising
  from the conditions at work. In recent years the unions have taken on more and more
  political activities.</p>

  <p>But the unions are limited in a different way, in that there is only so much that
  can be done within the limits or the framework of the capitalist relationship between
  workers and bosses. Thus the economic cycle of capitalist development is often decisive
  in determining what workers can achieve through a union or what they may have to
  concede. <strong>The cycle of capitalist development dictates the objective conditions
  in which the unions operate and in turn puts an obligation upon them, the workers and
  their leaders, to develop both tactics and strategic plans to combat this
  problem.</strong></p>

  <p>As long as the relationship of exploiter and exploited is retained within the
  framework of the capitalist system, the unions necessarily remain hemmed in and at the
  mercy of the capitalist cycle of development.</p>

  <p>One of the most pervasive myths regarding the standard of living of the workers is
  that it has gradually improved over the years. It is true that much has been gained by
  the workers. But the ravages of a capitalist crisis have often hurled them back.</p>

  <p>Everyone knows that the great capitalist crisis of the 1930s created havoc with the
  workers' standard of living. This happens with nearly every significant capitalist
  depression. It is only in periods of a capitalist upswing, or what is known as
  prosperity, that the workers are able to recover what was previously lost and perhaps
  gain more as a result of new opportunities for struggle.</p>

  <p>The capitalists attempt to take advantage of every capitalist crisis to carry out
  both indirect and frontal attacks against the working class as soon as they get the
  opportunity. "The origin of the crisis of the cities," we wrote in the middle of 1975,
  "lies therefore in the general crisis of capitalism in this country. The capitalists
  are trying to overcome their crisis by a general assault on the mass of the [municipal]
  workers, striking at the weakest link first--healthcare, social services, education,
  fire and sanitation."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1" name="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>We noted at that time, however, that "a broad frontal attack on the
  <strong>organized</strong> working class, especially in basic industries, is at the
  present time not possible though it is precisely what the ruling class has in mind."
  (Emphasis in original.)</p>

  <p>The frontal attack did come several years later and began with the demand for
  concessions from the organized working class, especially in the basic industries.
  Cutbacks and plant layoffs became the order of the day. The assault was one of the most
  venomous in the history of the U.S. working class. It not only struck the basic
  industries, mining and metal, it struck all manufacturing. The bourgeois state gave it
  added impetus with the breaking of the PATCO union of air traffic controllers. This
  concerted assault has tended to lower the wages of the higher-paid, thus leveling the
  standard of living of the workers as a whole. It has also destroyed the jobs of
  millions.</p>

  <p>During the 1970s the employers, unable to carry out a frontal attack on the workers,
  had to resort to more indirect means by fueling the fires of inflation. But the
  deflationary process that began in the 1980s necessitated a frontal attack.</p>

  <p>As can be seen, the capital-labor relationship puts the working class in a vise-like
  condition with respect to the employers. As long as they accept that relationship, the
  workers are in the subordinate position and their opportunities are limited by the very
  nature of the trade union organization, whose fundamental purpose is merely to bargain
  over the wages and conditions of employment (the price of exploitation).</p>

  <p>Members of a revolutionary working class party, as we'll go into more fully in
  Chapter 8, differ from mere trade unionists in that their goal is the abolition of the
  relationship of exploitation. But there is still another fundamental difference that is
  closely connected with this. They regard the antagonistic relationship between the
  employers and the workers as an irreconcilable one. This dictates an entirely different
  attitude in labor relations, negotiations and even grievance proceedings.</p>

  <p>Militant workers almost always instinctively understand this irreconcilable
  character of their relationship to the bosses. As a <em>Wall Street Journal</em>
  article on the 1985 Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel strike observed, when the workers were
  speaking about labor relations they referred to "a struggle between us and them." It is
  a clear-cut example of how the objective relationship of exploitation sinks into the
  consciousness of the workers as a struggle between "us and them."</p>

  <h3>Capitalist recessions have lengthened</h3>

  <p>The problem facing the trade union movement is how to effectuate strategy during
  times of chronic depression, of protracted capitalist overproduction which gives the
  employers the upper hand, at least on a narrow economic front.</p>

  <p>Capitalist recessions in the United States a century ago, such as the "panics" in
  1873 and 1893, were relatively short by comparison with the current ones. It was
  generally assumed at that time that the workers' movement, especially in Europe, was
  capable of resuming its upward swing politically and would soon make up what it could
  not win economically during periods of capitalist recession.</p>

  <p>On the whole, capitalist recessions were not as chronic and protracted in the last
  quarter of the 19th century as they are now. The illusion of capitalist stability and
  the resulting revisionism of Marxism toward the end of the 19th century came about as
  the result of this.</p>

  <p>But the period following the Second World War has been punctuated by longer-lasting
  recessions. No one can accurately estimate how long the earlier periods of relative
  capitalist stability would have lasted had the imperialists not created two world wars
  and innumerable counter-revolutionary interventions.</p>

  <p>All of these retarded the capitalist crises, at least temporarily. There is no
  question that the crises might have resulted in the overturn of class relations in at
  least some of the capitalist countries, had it not been for the intervention of
  war.</p>

  <p>All of this is very important in relation to strike strategy, which has a lot to do
  with the duration of the capitalist economic crisis. If the capitalist crisis were to
  last only a month or two months, the workers would be in a more advantageous
  position.</p>

  <p>Marx says that the most favorable time for the workers is a period of rapid
  capitalist accumulation. That aspect of Marxism every trade union bureaucrat will agree
  with.</p>

  <p>So the problem arises, what can be done during periods of capitalist recession when
  the workers are on the defensive? How should they react if the recession turns out to
  be protracted and the employers can seemingly hold out for a long time?</p>

  <p>The 1979-82 capitalist recession, which is certainly not over for the manufacturing
  industries, has also been accompanied by political reaction, by the most reactionary
  intervention of the capitalist state against all workers. The Reagan administration has
  generated reaction in all fields of social life. But separate and apart from the Reagan
  administration, the capitalist recession has had a universal effect. "Socialist"
  governments in Spain, France and Greece have been forced by the capitalist crisis to
  carry out almost the same austerity measures that the Reagans and Thatchers have
  imposed on the workers.</p>

  <p>So it is not really the form of the capitalist state which determines how the rulers
  respond to the capitalist crisis. The capitalist system engenders both
  social-democratic and outright reactionary forms in the administration of the
  capitalist state. It continually throws up a variety of political formations, few if
  any of which address themselves to the fundamental ills of the capitalist system or
  promote a revolutionary perspective.</p>

  <p>The lengthened character of the capitalist recessions imposes on the working class
  in general and the trade unions in particular the necessity to develop a defensive
  strategy. The working class as a whole can, after a period of time, transform this into
  an offensive. There is no way this can be done, however, without attempts to break out
  from the accepted bourgeois conception of the capital-labor relationship. Otherwise the
  workers are kept in a kind of stranglehold which they cannot get out of by economic
  means alone and which leads to a continuing stream of concessions to the employers.</p>

  <h3>Campaigns for prenotification</h3>

  <p>One such defensive strategy was first raised around 1956 in the upstate New York
  area. Those were not years of capitalist recession, but nevertheless the Ford Motor Co.
  closed its stamping plant, organized by the UAW, and Wickwire Steel, a plant owned by
  Colorado Iron and Fuel, also closed down around that time.</p>

  <p>Earlier, of course, there had been a tendency for plants in the North to flee to the
  South, where not only was labor cheaper but the climate was viciously anti-union. Many
  states in the South were still governed by so-called right-to-work laws. But when
  plants did relocate, it was generally with about the same kind of equipment and
  technology as in the North.</p>

  <p>It was in 1956 that militants in the Buffalo area for the first time in U.S. labor
  history introduced the idea of prenotification, designed to stop plant closings. Since
  then, prenotification has become widely publicized, even though the trade unions have
  been slow to avail themselves of this weapon in the struggle. Many local and state
  bills have been introduced which in one way or another contain prenotification
  provisions to halt the spread of plant closings. Few if any, however, have really been
  implemented into law.</p>

  <p>Prenotification usually means that before a plant can close, it is required by law
  to give the workers a notice of one or two years, depending upon how strong a
  legislative campaign the union and progressive movement have conducted. The tactic is
  to have hearings on the legislation. This halts the plant closings pending the
  hearings, which of course take place over an extended period. Penalties against the
  company designed to protect the workers and the community are assessed on the basis of
  public hearings.</p>

  <p>It cannot be stressed too strongly that the unions have to link up with the rest of
  the community, which has a great stake in this. For a company to move out and close a
  plant inflicts incalculable damage on a community as well as on the workers.</p>

  <p>In almost all communities the corporations are given subsidies in the form of tax
  breaks for locating there. Small homeowners and others, by comparison, seldom get any
  tax relief. Therefore penalties must be assessed in the event these companies want to
  pull out. This is a deterrent to plant closings.</p>

  <p>Of course, political pressure has to be applied at all levels of government, and in
  this respect the union also has to mobilize the masses politically in order to sustain
  the struggle and see that irreparable damage is not inflicted upon the communities.</p>

  <p>Wherever possible, injunctive relief should also be sought in the form of temporary
  restraining orders. In other words, the judicial process should be utilized,
  notwithstanding the fact that the judges are generally more reactionary than the
  legislators. But publicity around this type of case is a form of pressure and can
  mobilize the workers for more direct action. Just as farmers have learned to stop farm
  foreclosures, in some cases with overwhelming might, this has to be done on an
  industrial basis.</p>

  <p>Also state and federal legislators should be urged to introduce legislation
  declaring a moratorium on plant closings and where possible unions should collaborate
  with the legislators in framing the legislation. All this would be immensely
  educational and at the same time enhance trade union activity.</p>

  <p>There are now whole groupings of enlightened environmental groups which could also
  lend their support. They have come to realize the value of having an alliance between
  the working class and all progressives concerned about the damage that is inflicted
  upon the environment and society as a whole by the reckless pursuit of super-profits by
  the capitalist class.</p>

  <h3>Pentagon plant closings</h3>

  <p>It is often assumed that plant closings happen only in the civilian sector of the
  economy. It is further assumed that with the growth of the military budget and the
  consequent expansion of the Pentagon's operations, plant closings should not be a
  problem. However, this is not so.</p>

  <p>There are now 37,000 industrial firms serving the Pentagon as prime contractors, and
  three times as many subcontractors, according to Seymour Melman.<sup><a href=
  "#fn2">2</a></sup> &sbquo; This means that at least 100,000 industrial units operate to
  serve the Pentagon in one capacity or another.</p>

  <p>When the Pentagon decides to close out an operation, it of course is not motivated
  by the same considerations as a civilian production unit or plant. The latter is
  fundamentally concerned with maximizing its profit. That's the basis for its existence
  in the first place.</p>

  <p>It is altogether different with the Pentagon. They don't have to be concerned with
  profit or loss. The endless stream of appropriations grows ever larger as each new
  Congress gives the Pentagon a virtual carte blanche on how to dispose of billions of
  dollars. Occasionally the mere whim of the military bureaucracy can decide when and if
  to close down a plant or relocate it.</p>

  <p>The Pentagon has historically chosen to locate its business in areas away from a
  labor force which would be susceptible to union organization. Many times it forces the
  closure of plants out of purely racist considerations, always claiming a military
  rationale and using national security gobbledygook to cover itself. Most often, it
  prefers locating in rural or suburban areas away from the centers of contagious labor
  militancy that characterize the metropolitan areas of the country.</p>

  <p>There is also the matter of obsolescence, which often leads to layoffs and plant
  closings. It ranks high in the Pentagon as a means of producing sophisticated or exotic
  new technologies. But often these can be rapidly discredited, especially when one
  considers the sheer number and variety of weapons the Pentagon is involved in
  producing.</p>

  <p>It is well known how when legislators fail to vote for the Pentagon's appropriation
  requests, the military threatens to close military bases in their area. This practice
  is even more common when it comes to closing military production units.</p>

  <p>Should there be a sudden shift in weapons development, the closing of defense plants
  could become a far more serious development than it is now. The vast bulk of the
  subcontractors in particular are smaller units and mostly unorganized. However, they
  can be just as susceptible to and just as much in need of union organization as those
  in the civilian sector.</p>

  <p>In this connection, it should be borne in mind that in the first years after the
  Second World War, as well as after the Korean and Viet Nam wars, there were several
  public campaigns by progressive organizations to convert military production to
  civilian use. Of all the international unions in the country, the International
  Association of Machinists (IAM) was the only one to present a plan and attempt to
  publicize it in order to educate the public on the need for conversion of military
  production to public use.</p>

  <p>Since then, no other union has so far broached the subject, notwithstanding the
  staggering unemployment and the growth of the military.</p>
