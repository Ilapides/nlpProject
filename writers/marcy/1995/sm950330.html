  <h1>Where is U.S.-Japanese rivalry heading</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (March 30, 1995)</h5>

  <p>Many momentous questions have been raised by the poison-gas incident that has caused
  such a tragic loss of life in Tokyo's subway system. The evidence presented to the
  public so far points to a well- organized conspiracy. The question is, by whom?</p>

  <p>Regrets will of course be forthcoming from the imperialist rivals of Japan, as well
  as from neighboring countries. But this is the small change of history.</p>

  <p>This unprecedented attack takes place when the Western imperialists are more mindful
  than ever of Japan's potential for assuming economic, political, and ultimately
  military leadership in the region, even though these seem very distant at the present
  time.</p>

  <p>The struggle now, as it always has been, is a struggle for economic advantage among
  the ruling classes of each of the contending powers.</p>

  <h4>Behind Clinton's trip to Russia</h4>

  <p>The U.S. is not at all a disinterested observer of what goes on in this vital area.
  President Bill Clinton's plan to visit Russia is not just to give Boris Yeltsin a
  public pat on the back. It is also meant to remind Japan of U.S. imperialist interest
  in Asia.</p>

  <p>It is not the poisoning of thousands of individuals in Japan that will preoccupy
  President Clinton in his forthcoming talks with Yeltsin. What will be preoccupying them
  and their aides is the rising interest of Japanese investment capital throughout the
  entire region.</p>

  <p>Is this not a repeat of the imperialist rivalries of the late 1920s and early '30s?
  Is not the U.S. again attempting to rally French, British and German imperialism, with
  whom the U.S. has been at loggerheads, against the "yellow peril"?</p>

  <p>Times have changed, of course. The language has become more refined and gentlemanly.
  But imperialist appetites are just as voracious as ever and the stupendous development
  of the productive forces everywhere continually shifts the emphasis from purely
  economic rivalry to political struggle.</p>

  <p>And if that is not sufficient, then what? Isn't that what is occupying the thinking
  and the maneuvering in the capitals of the imperialist powers? It is in this regard
  that one must view President Clinton's hurried announcement of a trip to Russia. Why to
  Russia, all of a sudden? It is true that Yeltsin has for some time been trying to get
  Clinton to come for purely domestic reasons &mdash; to bolster his own waning political
  strength. But that is not Clinton's reason for going.</p>

  <p>Clinton needs to shore up U.S. diplomatic strength in Russia, Eastern Europe, the
  Middle East and above all in the Pacific.</p>

  <p>Because of the internecine struggles in the Middle East, it might have appeared that
  U.S. imperialist interest there was waning. But the larger interest of U.S. capital in
  combating Japanese expansion makes it incumbent for them to "show the flag" in order
  not to leave the impression that the U.S. is slowly being outdistanced by its
  imperialist rivals.</p>

  <p>The economic power of Japan could become a formidable factor in the Middle East if
  political obstacles created by other imperialist powers were not so overwhelming.</p>

  <p>Isn't this why World War II was fought? And isn't the situation today really a
  repetition of what preceded that war?</p>

  <p>Imperialist Germany and Japan were shorn of their military and naval power after the
  war. But they are putting up a deadly struggle for economic supremacy similar to the
  way the U.S. first overcame Britain in the early 1920s. Ludwell Denny, in his
  well-known book "America Conquers Britain," showed how the U.S. superseded British
  economic influence and power south of the U.S. border. Britain was not in a position to
  contemplate a military solution at the time.</p>

  <h4>Only one way out</h4>

  <p>What all this demonstrates is that the interminable imperialist contradictions and
  rivalries inevitably lead to military conflict. Only a socialist solution to the
  economic problems is a just one.</p>

  <p>Only the working class, by taking destiny into its own hands, can avoid the
  incalculable disasters of military struggle and spare humanity yet another devastating
  capitalist war.</p>

  <p>The situation cries out for a truly socialist solution among the community of
  nations in the area.</p>
