  <h1>Doomsday religions &amp; bourgeois pessimism</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy ( April 6, 1995)</h5>

  <p>The struggle between science and superstition seems never to end. The same can be
  said for the struggle between religion and the capitalist state. As long as such
  excruciating social contradictions as those that are rending capitalism asunder can be
  found all over the globe, as long as there are such extremes between super-abundant
  wealth and the misery of millions, all sorts of solutions are going to be put forth.
  This is not to say that contradictions between wealth and poverty did not exist in
  earlier epochs. Indeed, haven't they always constituted the essential elements for
  religious struggle against the state and its authorities? More religions than just
  Christianity were formed in reaction to the existence of extreme wealth amidst
  overwhelming poverty.</p>

  <p>The cry to drive the money changers out of the temples arose out of class struggle
  in ancient slave societies. That slogan, with slight changes, could well be raised in
  the struggles today against the modern super-rich and the Wall Street fraternity. Ever
  since uncontrollable imperialist competition ushered in the first bloody world war, the
  optimism that accompanied the earlier stages of capitalist development has given way to
  a profound pessimism. Even capitalism's greatest achievements in science and
  technology, applied to all the continents, the air, outer space, the seven seas and
  even under water, have not brought about that great outburst of enthusiasm one might
  have expected.</p>

  <p>In the early part of the 19th century, poets like Shelley and Byron could wax
  lyrical about the great human accomplishments to come. And their ringing words called
  forth to battle all those ready to give their lives for this new society that was
  springing from the rot of feudalism. But no longer.</p>

  <h4>Pessimism grows in Japan</h4>

  <p>The general pessimism engendered by capitalist relations is in the spotlight most of
  all right now in Japan. The Japanese government is accusing a religious cult, the Aum
  Shinri Kyo, of being behind the release of the deadly nerve gas sarin in five subway
  cars in downtown Tokyo on March 20. Ten people died from the poison gas and some 5,000
  more were hospitalized with injuries.</p>

  <p>Shoko Asahara, the leader of the cult, is reported to preach a doomsday scenario for
  the future &mdash; a war between the U.S. and Japan in 1997 in which Japan is totally
  destroyed. Asahara and other leaders of the group disappeared after the disaster. But
  press accounts say that in a video released since then he accuses the U.S. military of
  having spread the poison by plane.</p>

  <p>Why does such an apocalyptic view seem to thrive? It does so on the basis of the
  pessimistic outlook and destiny of imperialist Japan. Not just this cult but many
  militarist bourgeois currents in Japan constantly bemoan that it is hemmed in on all
  sides &mdash; by Russia to the north, China to the west, and the U.S. with its colossal naval
  and military presence in the Pacific.</p>

  <p>But there are other, revolutionary currents. In the 1970s, during a momentary upward
  movement in the class struggle, the youth of Japan spoke in their own voice and shared
  none of this pessimism. They were full of optimism and anticipation for the great
  potential of the Japanese working class to rise to its feet and challenge the
  imperialist ruling class.</p>

  <p>The gloomy outlook that a cultist like Asahara sees as eternity is in reality a
  momentary, passing development. It does not represent the great future and happy life
  for the masses that is possible given Japan's tremendous development in science,
  technology and industry. What prevents this is not some fate or destiny, but the
  incubus of private property interests and their offspring, monopoly capital.</p>

  <p>The same phenomenon has appeared in the U.S. Should we pass off David Koresh of the
  Branch Davidians and Jim Jones, both of whom also preached an imminent doomsday and
  apocalypse?</p>

  <h4>The Vale of Tears</h4>

  <p>The Vale of Tears appears in religion as a recurrent theme. It arose from the
  scarcity of food, arable land and resources in earlier times. But humanity has now
  passed that stage, at least in what is possible if not actual. The problem at this
  stage of capitalism is not scarcity but super-abundance. Yet for hundreds of millions
  around the world, life has not progressed much beyond the stone age because of the
  monopolization of wealth. What remains now is to free production from private property
  and organize it on a truly rational and human basis.</p>

  <p>The bourgeoisie can indulge in a little pessimism in their after-dinner discussions
  as they sip on the finest liqueurs and wines. The proletarian cannot emulate the
  bourgeois in this kind of self-indulgence.</p>

  <p>Pessimism comes from the ancient as well as the modern ruling classes. It is no part
  of working-class ideology. And while the bourgeoisie imposes its own pessimism on
  society as a whole, let's not take a momentary condition of the workers as their
  permanent status. The workers show their best qualities in struggle, the bourgeoisie
  their worst.</p>
