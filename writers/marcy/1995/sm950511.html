  <title>Workers World [Sam Marcy]: Lessons for the left (May 11, 1995)</title>

  <h1>Lessons for the left</h1>

  <h2>In the aftermath of Oklahoma City</h2>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (May 11, 1995)</h5>
  
  <p><em>The following is based on a speech by Sam
  Marcy, chairperson of Workers World Party, at a forum on April 28.</em></p>

  <p>These last two days have been days of crisis for both the federal government of the
  United States and for Oklahoma. The crisis probably reaches into a great many
  geographical areas, but more importantly into the political structure of the U.S.</p>

  <p>We have to remember the nature of the particular period we are living in, and how we
  assess it as communists. Our Party is doing so many great things that it would seem the
  political situation has eased and that reaction has simmered down somewhat.</p>

  <p>Certainly it is true that the possibility for organizing and moving the masses is
  greater. But we must also take into consideration the nature of the period we are
  living in.</p>

  <p>In the early days of the struggle for socialism, before the movement here was really
  Marxist, it faced an uphill struggle. But it wasn't subject to great ups and downs.</p>

  <p>It was not focused on broad economic and political changes in the country. Its
  approach was to organize workers, sign them up, and fight for socialism. And to that
  extent it was very important and very good. But this approach can come up against the
  stumbling block of reality when we look more closely at what is happening.</p>

  <p>The question of the greatest importance is not so much what has happened in Oklahoma
  City but what the political tendencies in the ruling class have been doing that
  concerns Oklahoma.</p>

  <h4>Testing ground for far right</h4>

  <p>It seems that the bombing in Oklahoma was supposed to be a testing ground for the
  viability of the right wing. The attack might cause a great many casualties, but the
  far right would come out stronger.</p>

  <p>But it seems that the opposite has happened. The ultra-right wing has been brought
  down somewhat. However, it has not hurt the image of the right wing generally.</p>

  <p>So while there are major opportunities for the progressive movement, there are also
  grave political developments in the country. They have an invariable tendency to dampen
  the progressive movement, to quiet it, to disintegrate it.</p>

  <p>Those are the things we have to take into account without diminishing our ardor or
  our interest in what we are doing. For the moment, the plans of the ultra-right have
  been defeated. For the moment.</p>

  <p>They haven't been defeated by the current administration, although Clinton is to
  some extent willing to take credit for it. But the current administration is a
  generator of right-wing sentiment and right-wing politics itself. In fact, the right
  wing started moving as soon as Clinton got in. Instead of having lost prestige or
  standing, the right wing got further enhanced as a result of Clinton's election.</p>

  <p>And it has become bolder and more aggressive in this particular period.</p>

  <p>Large sections of the more enlightened elements in the bourgeoisie are very well
  aware of this. We are even more so, but in a different way because we have a task to
  carry out: to enlighten the workers.</p>

  <p>We have to constantly breathe the spirit of revolutionary optimism while at the same
  time not neglecting to show where the enemy is, where it is moving, how aggressive it
  is becoming and what citadels of progress it is taking over.</p>

  <h4>Economic problems drive ruling class to the right</h4>

  <p>My estimate at the present moment is that the ultra-right has been set back somewhat
  as a result of what happened in Oklahoma. The Clinton administration is trying to take
  some credit for it, but the truth is they haven't pronounced themselves against the
  ultra-right, against their vandalism, against their criminality, against everything
  that they do. They haven't dared to arrest those who have carried out illegal political
  activity, including crimes. They let them alone. And they will continue to do so. The
  task of defeating the right and the ultra-right is a revolutionary task of the working
  class.</p>

  <p>There are very dangerous developments in the ruling class, more so than in earlier
  periods. The economic problems of the U.S. in particular and of world capitalism in
  general are pushing them in that direction. The economic crisis that might have
  occurred a year or two ago was delayed, did not mature, did not develop. This has
  allowed capitalism to live in sort of a dream, going beyond its own capacities.</p>

  <p>When the situation ripens economically for a capitalist collapse or near collapse,
  the bourgeoisie or its political leaders have learned since the early 1930s to take
  advantage of it in order to turn their guns against the masses.</p>

  <p>The rise of Hitler came as the result of an economic depression. Hitler made a big
  bid for power in the late 1920s. That one didn't succeed because it came when there was
  stable capitalist development in Germany. But as soon as the economic crisis came, he
  took advantage of it to discredit capitalist democracy. He used the capitalist crisis
  to foster fascism, which is a different political form of capitalist class rule.</p>

  <p>During that period the Communist Party carried out revolutionary agitation and
  propaganda in the struggle against Hitler and all the other reactionaries. But at the
  same time they were hindered by an erroneous analysis. They predicted that if Hitler
  were to take over the capitalist government in a time of crisis, he would be sure to
  fail economically, and then he would be discredited. They left out the fact that when
  he took over he would use police and military powers to destroy the working-class
  organizations and all democratic forces. All this has some relevance to our discussion
  on Oklahoma.</p>

  <p>On the one hand we have to pay the closest attention to what is happening
  politically in the country with respect to the struggle of tendencies in the ruling
  class and how a workers' party has to respond.</p>

  <p>But we also cannot be diverted from our mass activities, which have to be carried
  out with maximum optimism while taking the political crisis in stride.</p>

  <p>If we accomplish only a small part of what I have suggested, I think our Party will
  make a great stride forward and will strengthen its position in the working class and
  in the world movement.</p>
