  <h1>Capitalism's day of reckoning approaches</h1>

  <h5>By Sam Marcy (Dec. 7, 1995)</h5>

  <p>When Marxism is discussed in the bourgeois universities, the question often arises:
  What accounts for the durability of Marxist theory over the years, especially
  considering the setbacks of the working class in various countries?</p>

  <p>Why has Marxism persisted as the doctrine of the working-class struggle, despite
  persecution in almost every land?</p>

  <p>Some seek mystical answers. Others may go so far as to look upon Marxism as an
  eternal truth.</p>

  <p>If Marxism were a religious doctrine, its persistence would be easily explained as
  the work of divine inspiration. But that would be contrary to everything Marxism
  teaches &mdash; the materialist interpretation of history above all.</p>

  <p>Still, the question arises again and again. Why has Marxism endured in so many
  countries, despite the signal defeats in the USSR and Eastern Europe?</p>

  <p>We must seek the answer in material conditions.</p>

  <p>It has persisted because the working class needs a doctrine in order to combat its
  class enemies, particularly the bourgeoisie. Nowhere and at no time has the working
  class defeated the bourgeoisie without recourse to the theory of revolutionary
  Marxism.</p>

  <p>History teaches that just to open up a serious struggle against the bourgeoisie, it
  is necessary to have a Marxist understanding of the nature of the class struggle.</p>

  <h4>Capitalism emerged from feudalism</h4>

  <p>At this time capitalism is in high gear. Capitalist production is constantly
  expanding all over the world, seemingly without limits. Feudalism having been
  destroyed, first in Europe and later in the rest of the world, the gates to capitalist
  development are wide open almost everywhere.</p>

  <p>The development of capitalism differs widely from feudalism. Feudalism, however one
  interprets its origins or development, was basically a stationary system. Only when
  embryonic capitalism broke away from feudal restrictions and began to expand outward
  did it became a serious factor in Europe.</p>

  <p>The transition period from feudalism to capitalism was not an automatic economic
  process, by any means. It was accompanied by revolutionary struggles that arose as a
  result of capitalism's need to expand.</p>

  <p>Feudalism's further existence in a stationary situation led to stagnation and the
  decay of the limited productive forces developed up to that time. Only a break from the
  confines of the feudal system opened up the road to capitalist development.</p>

  <p>The feudal ruling classes were inherently opposed to expansion. They concerned
  themselves mainly with reproducing what they already had. Bourgeois historians forget
  to mention that all this was possible so long as the peasantry produced all the goods
  and services for a decadent landlord class.</p>

  <p>Once the ruling classes of Europe began to reach out beyond their static societies,
  they opened the gateway to revolutionary change.</p>

  <p>Columbus' voyage in search of a new world, for example, was not just an individual
  entrepreneurial effort. It was sponsored by Queen Isabella of Spain. In the long run,
  it tremendously spurred the growth of the bourgeoisie in Europe.</p>

  <h4>Momentous era approaches</h4>

  <p>The question that arises in the contemporary period is whether the further
  development of capitalism can be accomplished in a "peaceful" way, without stepping on
  the rights of millions of people. The recent history of capitalism &mdash; indeed the
  whole 20th century &mdash; speaks against it.</p>

  <p>After the tremendous conflagration of World War II, it was thought in some circles
  that the competition among the so-called great powers would end in a peaceful, general
  agreement sanctified by such organizations as the United Nations. But nothing of the
  sort is happening. The voracious appetite of the U.S. monopolies gives no ground for
  belief in any of this.</p>

  <p>The same could be said of the other imperialist powers. They have not grown less
  voracious but are held at bay everywhere on the globe by the monstrous growth of U.S.
  militarism.</p>

  <p>Yet the whole edifice of capitalism is marked by instability. It cannot avoid a
  capitalist economic downturn at some point.</p>

  <p>Even among capitalist economists, there is really none who predicts an end to the
  severe economic crises caused by capitalist overproduction.</p>

  <p>The cyclically occurring crises of earlier years have been held at bay by stupendous
  military contracts during peacetime, allowing the capitalist economy to retain a
  precarious stability. Yet this cannot go on for long.</p>

  <p>The reckoning may be delayed, but it is sure to come.</p>

  <p>What needs to be considered by the militant, more class-conscious, more wide-awake
  elements in the working-class movement? It is how to prepare for the coming period.</p>

  <p>The very success of capitalism in vastly expanding the means of production through
  ruthlessly restructuring will disrupt the present economic patterns and lay bare the
  most important contradiction of capitalism. That contradiction is between the
  socialized character of the production process and the individual &mdash; really
  corporate &mdash; ownership of the basic means of production.</p>

  <p>A momentous era is fast approaching. It will not only influence U.S. history but
  will have far-reaching effects throughout the world.</p>
