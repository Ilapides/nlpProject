<p class="indent"><strong>1987:</strong> <a href="wallst.html" target="new">Wall Street Crash: What does it mean?</a> What happens at the stock market is a representation of the conditions of capitalist production.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1986</strong> <a href="hightech/index.html" target="new">High Tech, Low Pay: A Marxist analysis of the changing character of the working class</a> Under modern-day monopoly capitalism, with its enormous and costly military superstructure and its irreversible drive to revolutionize the means of production, the cost of production has become excessive. The capitalists must make an ever greater effort to unload these excessive costs on the working class; hence, high tech and low wages. Their anti-labor offensive is not the product of an aberration on the part of individual capitalists but comes from deep historical roots. It is a symptom showing that the system is economically out of date and bound to decline.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1985</strong> <a href="bolsheviksandwar/index.html" target="new">Bolsheviks and War: Lessons for today&rsquo;s anti-war movement</a> It is astonishing that today years after the October Revolution in Russia so many profound lessons are still as relevant as they were the day after the victory of the revolution. Take the question, for instance, of the struggle against war. Its urgency proclaims itself every day in the headlines of the world press.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1983:</strong> <a href="manifesto.html" target="new"><em>The Communist Manifesto</em>: A clarion call full of ideas</a></p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1981:</strong> <a href="reindustrialization/index.html" target="new">Reindustrialization: The Menace Behind the Promise</a> There has rarely if ever been a declining empire built on exploitation and conquest which has not dreamed of restoring the old glory and splendor of its golden age of robbery and oppression with just one more try.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1980</strong> <a href="generals/index.html" target="new">Generals over the White House</a> &ldquo;Our view of the military differs fundamentally from the anti-militarism of the liberal and progressive elements in capitalist society. They fail to recognize that the structure of capitalist society, that is, the relationship between the basic classes, determines the politics of the capitalist state, no matter which policy the governing group may pursue. This policy is inevitably imperialist and today inexorably serves the military-industrial complex, which, willy-nilly, is propelled in the direction of imperialist war.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1979</strong> <a href="imperialistcrisis/index.html" target="new">Imperialism &amp; the Crisis in the Socialist Camp</a> Written both before and after China&rsquo;s invasion of Vietnam, this is much more than mere commentary on these events. They alert the progressive forces to the full magnitude of the betrayal by China&rsquo;s leaders by placing it in its historical perspective.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1977</strong> <a href="china/index.html" target="new">China: End of the Revolutionary Mao Era</a> The articles in this pamphlet &mdash; taken from the pages of <em>Workers World</em> newspaper in late 1976 and early 1977 &mdash; deal mostly with the defeat of the left wing of the Chinese Communist Party and the comeback of the rightists who were purged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of 1966&ndash;1970.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1977</strong> <a href="1977-ussr/index.html" target="new">The Class Character of the USSR</a> A collection of Marcy&rsquo;s writings published by his party, the Workers World Party. It includes an introduction and a long essay by Vince Copeland titled <em>The History of USSR-China Relations</em>.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1977</strong> <a href="eurocommunism/index.html" target="new">Eurocommunism: New form of reformism</a> The wide-open split between the Spanish, Italian, and French CPs on the one hand and the Soviet CP on the other brings to a definitive conclusion an entire epoch in the history of the revolutionary proletariat of Western Europe.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1975</strong> <a href="economicstagnation.html" target="new">Capitalist economic stagnation and the revolutionary perspective</a> The most effective answer to the crisis of the cities lies in a general working class counter-offensive against the ruling class which would unite Blacks, Chicanos, Puerto Ricans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and whites, men and women, in a common struggle against Washington and Wall Street.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1975</strong> <a href="busing.html" target="new">Busing and self-determination</a> It is the right of every oppressed people to demand and obtain self-determination, including the right of separation. Marxist-Leninists in the oppressing nation must firmly uphold this right, which includes the right of the oppressed nation to secede and set up a separate state.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1974</strong> <a href="portugal/index.html" target="new">Portugal &mdash; Revolutionary developments</a> On April 25th, 1974, a radical faction within the Portuguese Armed Forces, the MFA, revolted against the government. Until that day Portugal had been under a fascist dictatorship for over half a century. Includes a chronology of events.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1972</strong> <a href="china/2_index.html" target="new">China and the Class War 1959&ndash;1972</a> A series of articles that appeared in the pages of <em>Workers World</em> newspaper. It should be noted that the first article in the very first issue of <em>Workers World</em> (March 1959) hailed the Chinese communes, which were then a new development, as a big shift to the left in the progress of People&rsquo;s China.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1968</strong> <a href="czech/index.html" target="new">Czechoslovakia 1968: The Class Character of the Events</a> Few if any developments during the post World War II period were as deeply influenced by international considerations as the development of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. What is often most obscured in discussions of Czechoslovakia, especially since the attempted counter-revolution, is the early role of the Communist Party.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>1950&ndash;57:</strong> <a href="gclasswar/index.html" target="new">Global Class War</a> Three documents by Sam Marcy from 1950, 1953 and 1957 that together summarize the theoretical and ideological positions that led to the formation of Workers World Party</p>
