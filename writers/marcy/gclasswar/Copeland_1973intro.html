      <h2>Introduction to the Global Class War Documents</h2>
      <h4>by Vincent Copeland<br />
	  <small>July 1973</small></h4>
      <p>This compilation of documents by Sam Marcy may at first sight be a little formidable to new comrades. But it is actually
      the shortest and simplest summary of the theoretical and ideological positions that led to the formation of Workers World
      Party and still constitute a large part of our doctrine.</p>
      <p>It is even possible to say that the first document in particular was, when it was written in 1950 and still is today, a
      summary of the world relation of forces between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, as well as a long-term orientation for
      proletarian revolutionaries.</p>
      <p>There are few documents in the communist movement that can be so defined or stand such a test. Where is the analysis of
      either world or national political conditions written by Browder, Foster, or Stalin that can even stand the light of day
      today, much less be considered at all applicable to our own time?</p>
      <p>Even in the greatly changed world situation of 1973 there is nothing of substance that has to be altered in these essays,
      nothing that we would wish to erase from the history of our ideological battles. On the contrary, it may be that only through
      some perusal of these records can one fully appreciate our method and fully understand our application of
      Marxism-Leninism.</p>
      <p>However, some of the emphasis would have to be changed in similar discussions today. And since the events and
      personalities and even the parties discussed are different, and since altogether new political parties are now on the scene,
      it is necessary to introduce these pieces with some description of the political situation that prevailed when they were
      written.</p>
      <p>And it is necessary to add that this is why we make this an 
      <strong>internal document</strong>. It is not that any of our history is a secret from the movement or from our class. But it
      is impossible to correctly interpret certain 
      <strong>important nuances</strong> of these particular documents—which are from sixteen to twenty-three years old and were
      &ldquo;internal&rdquo; to begin with—without being fairly well tuned-in to the politics and theory of Workers World Party.</p>
      <p>To begin with, they were all directed against the leadership of the old Socialist Workers Party at a time when that
      leadership still remembered, however dimly, the great Russian Revolution. And although it was already betraying the
      revolutionary teachings of Leon Trotsky, it still kept the shell of those teachings and it still appeared to be to the left
      of the U.S. Communist Party. Its anti-Sovietism and anti-communism were not so pronounced as today, and were concealed from
      its own membership and even to some degree from ourselves. The membership generally still imagined the party was for the
      revolutionary defense of the Soviet Union.</p>
      <p>In this connection one of the most important nuances of the 1950 document on the Global Class War is expressed in the use
      of the term &ldquo;Stalinist.&rdquo; This term is used exclusively in the old sense in that document—that is, as a characterization
      of the conservative, revisionist and occasionally even reactionary wing of the world communist movement.</p>
      <p>Stalin was still alive in 1950 and was actively trying to maneuver for &ldquo;peaceful coexistence&rdquo; even in the middle of
      the cold war. He had only gained the image of a left-winger because of the three preceding years of world bourgeois
      hostility, and then only in some quarters. (It is extremely dubious, for example, whether Mao Tse-tung at that time regarded
      Stalin as a very strong champion of the Chinese revolution!)</p>
      <p>In the fight between Trotsky and Stalin it was Trotsky who constantly referred to his own faction as the
      &ldquo;Bolshevik-Leninist&rdquo; faction, and it was Stalin who referred to the Left Opposition members as &ldquo;Trotskyists.&rdquo; Trotsky
      never really accepted the latter term and he himself always put sarcastic quotation marks around it. Finally, in
      self-defense, he called the conservative faction &ldquo;Stalinist&rdquo;—but mainly in order to emphasize that Stalin personified a
      basic departure from Leninism.</p>
      <p>Given the continued isolation of the revolutionary wing, it was inevitable that we should lose the terminological battle
      and that the term &ldquo;Stalinism&rdquo; would come to mean—in a way—what the CP said it meant or what the bourgeoisie said it
      meant, since language by its very nature is the instrument of large numbers of people.</p>
      <p>Comrade Marcy turned to just this subject in the final document, that of 1957, and gives a political and class analysis of
      the question. By this time it was crucially important, particularly in the light of Khrushchev&#39;s speech against Stalin
      (which nearly all factions including the Chinese CP, 
      <strong>supported</strong> at the time) to make a clear exposition of the term and show its 
      <strong>relatively</strong> progressive side. Significantly enough, nobody but Marcy made this clarification, so far as I am
      aware.</p>
      <p>But the first document, that of 1950, needs to be viewed with the thorough understanding of the words &ldquo;Stalinism&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Stalinist&rdquo; in their original context as meaning in the document the bureaucratic degeneration of the revolution— 
      <strong>and nothing else</strong>.</p>
      <p>The document was written just after the Korean War began, and when it seemed to be already over, after MacArthur had
      pushed up through North Korea to the Yalu River border of Peoples China. This was before the Chinese came into the war and
      when Korea appeared to be defeated by the imperialists.</p>
      <p>Thus much is said in the past tense about a Korean &ldquo;defeat.&rdquo; And this was happily corrected by later events not
      recorded in the document. However the thesis is saturated with optimism about the &ldquo;coming&rdquo; victories over imperialism and
      the Chinese assistance to Korea was in that sense fully predicted.</p>
      <p>The SWP had at first taken a &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; attitude in the Korean War, supporting neither North nor South and actually
      talking about &ldquo;puppets of the West and puppets of the East&rdquo; or some such formulation. But after a few weeks, partly under
      pressure from the Marcy tendency, and partly because of the aweinspiring struggle of the Koreans themselves, the party came
      out for the proletarian North. But even then, the SWP leadership did not remotely take the position of &ldquo;two class camps,&rdquo;
      much less that of two 
      <strong>global</strong> class camps, as advocated in the document.</p>
      <p>In fact, this document on global class war led directly to the SWP accusation of &ldquo;Stalinism&rdquo; against the Marcy
      tendency.</p>
      <p>Marcy was in reality continuing Trotsky&#39;s defense of the Soviet Union in the new post-World War Two epoch and moreover
      asserting the 
      <strong>revolutionary</strong> defense as opposed to the conservative, intermittent, undependable, maneuverist, Stalinist
      defense. But the SWP leaders called this ... Stalinism!</p>
      <p>The irony of it all was that they themselves were supposed to be infinitely more for the defense of the revolution than
      the CP, but they had managed to become in reality less for that defense than the CP. If this is not said explicitly in the
      document, it is only because of the deception and self-deception practiced by the SWP leadership at the time. Marcy could
      suspect or deduce such an attitude on the SWP leadership&#39;s part, but it would have been impossible to make such a
      suspicion public, or to define it politically and clearly at the time.</p>
      <p>In retrospect, however, it must be said categorically that the SWP leadership, in spite of their traditions, were already
      by 1950, hiding behind Trotsky&#39;s 
      <strong>proletarian revolutionary</strong> anti-Stalinism and using it to rationalize a gradually more conservative position,
      as they had during the previous two or three years of the cold war.</p>
      <p>The first 
      <strong>formal</strong> tipoff as to their changing position was their difficulty at arriving at a theoretical definition of
      the class nature of the countries of Eastern Europe and above all in defining the class nature of the new Chinese state.</p>
      <p>Among the several important contributions of Marcy&rsquo;s 1950 document was Marcy&#39;s insistence that Peoples China was in
      fact the dictatorship of the proletariat. Such a position was absolutely unique in the SWP at that time and was one of the
      reasons that the SWP leaders labeled us as &ldquo;Stalinists.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>It should be added at once, of course, that this was also a bold proposition in the world movement as a whole. No one
      else, so far as I know, in Europe or Asia or in the United States, made this point—and certainly not with such categorical
      clarity.</p>
      <p>The U.S. CP called Peoples China a &ldquo;People&#39;s Democracy.&rdquo; (It did draw most of the 
      <strong>conclusions</strong> that would flow from our own more scientific and revolutionary description. And its weaker
      characterization was partly in imitation of Stalin, partly a special American version of bowing to the cold war in
      terminology.) And in China itself the party also hedged, although perhaps more for political reasons and pressures (e.g.,
      from the left Kuomintang) than because of theoretical errors.</p>
      <p>The second document—that of 1953—concretizes some of the propositions of the first in connection with actual
      organizational questions. It is complicated, however, by the fact that it refers to a &ldquo;Majority&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Minority&rdquo; and
      the Minority was not the Marcy tendency, but another one that had found some vulnerable points in the Majority (Cannon-Dobbs)
      position, but were themselves on the way out of the movement altogether.</p>
      <p>Comrade Marcy&#39;s analysis here is also remarkable for its anticipation of this fact and for its careful sorting out of
      the Majority and Minority attitudes toward the CP. He shows the Minority&rsquo;s accusation against the Majority for
      &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo; in refusing to deal with the CP was a false issue. The question was one of opportunism and capitulation to
      imperialism through the medium of SWP adapting to the imperialist-influenced trade union workers at that time. But it was
      opportunism 
      <strong>on both sides</strong>.</p>
      <p>The SWP majority was capitulating to imperialism, as the Minority somewhat understood. And the Minority was capitulating
      to the old &ldquo;Stalinism&rdquo;—or rather to the idea that an 
      <strong>ideological</strong> coalition between revolutionary Trotskyism and the CP would result in great gains. In one sense
      this might have been very true. But the view lacked seriousness as well as principle and the Minority did not even try to
      carry out its supposed perspective when it left the SWP.</p>
      <p>Marcy shows what the problem really was. His comments on Henry Wallace, on the Rosenbergs and on the Trotsky conversations
      on critical support of Browder&#39;s Presidential campaign, are all meant to emphasize the problem of a correct and
      revolutionary approach to the CPs of the world. And in the course of this he shows that the U.S. workers do not have a
      separate destiny (as Cannon and the SWP Majority wanted to believe) Independent of the world communist movement, and that a
      workers&rsquo; cadre must be created that is international to the core, in spite of American pragmatism and chauvinist
      anti-foreignism.</p>
      <p>There emerges concretely in the third document what is still a little abstract in the second, or at least not as sharp as
      in the third. This is the attitude toward the crisis within the CP. Which way are the CP dissidents going? To the left or to
      the right?</p>
      <p>Naturally, there have always been some left dissidents (among them, originally, ourselves). But ever since the cold war,
      the SWP leaders showed a remarkable ability to welcome the 
      <strong>right</strong> dissidents, who were the predominant trend since that time, and an inability to see who were the
      leftists!</p>
      <p>This letter about the evolution of Joseph Clark, a long-time leader of the CP, was just one of a whole series of
      statements we made after the 20th Congress of the CP of the Soviet Union, the one in which Khrushchev made his famous 1956
      speech against Stalin. It was a year after the Hungarian counter-revolution, which figures importantly in the logic of the
      letter.</p>
      <p>This particular letter was written in 1957 just about a year and a half after Khrushchev&#39;s speech. And even at that
      time no one but ourselves had analyzed that speech 
      <strong>from the left</strong>. Even the Chinese revolutionaries were only to criticize it several years later.</p>
      <p>After Khrushchev&#39;s speech and after the Hungarian counter-revolution in particular, there was a veritable exodus out
      of the CPs of the world, especially the U.S. CP. And this was the occasion for the biggest illusions on the part of the SWP
      leadership that they were going to recruit thousands of ex-CP&rsquo;ers. (In this they took over the vacated position of the
      &ldquo;Minority&rdquo; discussed in the second document.)</p>
      <p>It is also worth noting that the SWP leaders were not alone in their giddiness about the &ldquo;new&rdquo; CP stance and what they
      called &ldquo;regroupment of the left.&rdquo; The general U.S. movement was at its nadir, even though McCarthyism as such had been
      set back by the liberal bourgeoisie. And many were the elements, including some leaders in the CP today, who thought
      Khrushchev was leading them toward a great new radicalization and reconciliation of tendencies on a world basis. And from the
      heights of Mao Tse-tung to the depths of Carl Davidson (or his equivalents at the time) nobody but ourselves challenged this
      thesis.</p>
      <p>Comrade Marcy&#39;s letter was then all the more illuminating about the real situation. But by the same token it threw a
      bucket of cold water on the hot hopes of the &ldquo;regroupers&rdquo; in the SWP. So it led to cries of &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo; against us
      as well as the old familiar accusation of &ldquo;Stalinism.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Finally, from all this and especially from the documents themselves it ought to be clear why ninety-nine times out of a
      hundred, we do not rush to defend ourselves nowadays when our critics call us &ldquo;Stalinist.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>This is not because of the nature of Stalinism, but because of the nature of our 
      <strong>critics</strong>. Nearly all of these solidarize in some way with the SWP or with the &ldquo;democratic opposition&rdquo;
      (i.e. the capitalist restorationists) in the Soviet Union. As against 
      <strong>them</strong>, we solidarize with the &ldquo;Stalinists&rdquo; even while we oppose the ideology of Stalinism.</p>
      <p>As for those other critics among the so-called Maoist-Stalinists of the United States today, those who call us
      &ldquo;counter-revolutionary Trotskyists,&rdquo; etc., they may prove to be less of a problem in the long run despite their present
      ultimatistic and thoughtless invective. But their case requires special treatment which the present documents, although
      obviously monumental alongside the Lilliputian efforts of the &ldquo;theoreticians&rdquo; of the Guardian stripe, do not supply.</p>
      <p>This omission, it should be remembered, is mostly due to the fact that Mao himself omitted any defense of Stalin at the
      time. And outside of ourselves no one in the United States had yet noticed that Mao was to the left of Khrushchev (which he
      undoubtedly was, in spite of his silence on Khrushchev and the 20th Congress!)</p>
      <p>This important question is now somewhat more pressing and contemporary than the matters contained in the present work. But
      without a clear understanding of the old questions it will be difficult for us to gain the kind of clarity that we need in
      dealing with new ones.</p>
