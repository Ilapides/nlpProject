<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1948/index.htm#m48_03" target="new">Vol. XII No. 3</a>, 19 January 1948, p.&nbsp;2.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst">The report of the President&rsquo;s Commission on Higher
Education, now being released in installments, is one of the most
significant social documents ever published by the U.S. government.
It is a public confession by an official body that a crisis exists in
this crucial field of contemporary society.</p>

<p><I>The Commission members represented the cream of America&rsquo;s
crop of professional educators and publicists. Not only were there
deans and college presidents, but also Rabbi Wise, President of the
American Jewish Congress, Mark Starr, educational director of the
International Garment Workers Union, Murray D. Lincoln, president of
the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation, Douglas S. Freeman, editor of the
Richmond, Va., <B>News Leader</B>.</I></p>

<p>The Commission begins its report with a recognition of the
&ldquo;worldwide crisis of mankind.&rdquo; And in the field which
they, as &ldquo;civic and educational leaders,&rdquo; know best, they
are terrified at the gap which exists on the one hand, between
&ldquo;Scientific knowledge and technical skills,&rdquo; and on the
other, the &ldquo;social and political defenses against
obliteration.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Terror-Stricken</h4>

<p class="fst">The Commission is further appalled at the &ldquo;over-specialization&rdquo;
in professional education, and the lack of &ldquo;human wholeness and
civic conscience which the cooperative activities of citizenship
require.&rdquo; It bewails the &ldquo;provincial and insular mind&rdquo;
in a period when the &ldquo;oneness of the modern world&rdquo; is so
undeniable. It bemoans the lack of equality for the poor and the
Negro and Jewish minorities, at a time when the U.S. &ldquo;sorely
needs&rdquo; to develop &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; and &ldquo;social
competence.&rdquo; No less important, it is terror-stricken at the
explosions that are inevitable, given this inequality.</p>

<p><I>Undoubtedly, the members of this exalted Commission would be
the first to accuse Marxists of &ldquo;idealism,&rdquo; &ldquo;crass
materialism,&rdquo; &ldquo;economic determinism&rdquo; and all the
other epithets by which the bourgeois intellectuals justify their
role as the hired prize fighters for the ruling class. Yet the
critical situation which they describe is merely the concretization,
within the field of education, of the contradiction which scientific
socialists have long realized would bring capitalist society to a
inglorious end. What the Commission is actually talking about is, in
Marxist terminology, the contradiction between the development of the
productive forces and the antagonistic social relations.</I></p>

<p>It is because capitalist production mutilates the worker to a
fragment of a man that the professions can only breed
super-specialists. It is because under capitalism the nation must
compete on the world market in imperialist rivalry with other nations
that the population is provincial, is patriotically mobilized by the
state behind a single nation. It is because under capitalism the poor
are only required for the most unskilled labor in field and factory
that there is unequal educational opportunity.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Real Solution</h4>

<p class="fst">The contradiction between scientific progress and social waste
cannot be resolved by giving more courses in social sciences or by
adding &ldquo;men of broad knowledge, men of imagination and
understanding and wisdom&rdquo; to teaching staffs. It can, in
reality, only be resolved by building a new world society in which
the exploitation of the workers has been abolished, and the
competitive world market destroyed.</p>

<p>How closely these educators approach the answer, and yet how
blinded they are by the typical illusions of the intellectual, is
indicated by the &ldquo;radical adjustments&rdquo; which they
recommend. As the first principles of higher education in our time,
the Commission proposes that all the people of the nation should be
given:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;Education for a fuller realization of democracy
in every phase of living.</I></p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;Education directly and explicitly for
international understanding and cooperation.</I></p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;Education for the application of creative
imagination and trained intelligence to the solution of social
problems and to the administration of public affairs.&rdquo;</I></p>

<p class="fst">Turned right side up, these principles are the principles of a new
socialist society. That is, if in their daily lives, the workers had
democracy, that is control over production; if the workers could
employ the modern development of the creative imagination and trained
intelligence for which the modern development of the productive
forces has prepared them &ndash; then education for all the people of
the nation would be democratic, international and creative. On the
other hand, without such a revolutionary change, education will
either continue in its present crisis, or like the rest of society
assume the facade of &ldquo;social responsibility and organization&rdquo;
along the lines of Hitler Germany.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>More Funds</h4>

<p class="fst">Unable to see through to either conclusion, the President&rsquo;s
Commission tries to find refuge from its own analysis by proposing &ndash;
an expansion program. It calls upon the state to devote more funds
for scholarships, to erect more colleges, and to set up more
committees. As if by increasing the QUANTITY of education, the
QUALITATIVE contradiction could be resolved!</p>

<p>The more students there are, the more acute will become the crisis
in the academic world. The Commission itself admits that there is a
&ldquo;high degree of student mortality&rdquo; because higher
education is unstimulating and unchallenging. Witness also the
dissatisfaction of the veterans who make up 55% of the present
college enrollment. Moreover, in the weakest link of higher education
today, the teachers colleges, it is not lack of resources which is
creating a crisis. As was dramatically revealed by the nationwide
teachers&rsquo; strike in 1946&ndash;47, American capitalism cannot even
recruit sufficient teachers. Before the war the turnover in public
school teachers was 10%. Today it is 20%.</p>

<p><I>The American ruling class cannot convince the teachers that
they are missionaries of an all-conquering and superior ideology and
therefore should subordinate the problem of their livelihood to their
civic responsibility to capitalist society. Many teachers, walking
the picket lines, discovered that their revolt against the city
fathers brought them greater respect from students and parents than
they had ever received as guardians and purveyors of capitalist
ideology in the classroom.</I></p>

<p>It is a commentary on the bankruptcy of the capitalist ruling,
class today that the sweeping changes necessary in the spheres of
higher education depend upon the workers at the base of society.</p>
