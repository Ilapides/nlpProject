    Chapter 1 – The Early Period
Preparatory Work

    The Lanka Sama Samaja Party was founded on December 18th 1935 with the broad aims of Independence and Socialism, by a group of young people who had gathered together for that purpose.
The idea did not fall from the sky but had been maturing for some time. The only other parties that could be said to have existed at the time were the Ceylon National Congress and the Ceylon Labour Party. The Ceylon National Congress representing the interests of the Ceylonese capitalists, was following a policy of begging for constitutional reforms, with the aim of Dominion Status, in much the same manner as the Liberals in India. The Labour Party, which had played a progressive role along with the Ceylon Labour Union in the twenties in the first important awakening of Ceylon’s working class, had degenerated into a one-man show, and in any case had nothing to do with Socialism. There was a void to be filled.
Just as the idea of the new party did not fall from the sky, so also the group of people who formed it did not suddenly gather together from nowhere. It was a grouping that had collected as the result of some patient work over a few years. The group that was the precursor of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party was first formed some time in the latter part of 1933. But one might go even further back to the Wellawatte Mills Strike of 1932, the leadership of which had been provided by individuals who were later to become members of the group.
The group at the commencement numbered a bare half-dozen composed principally of students who had returned from abroad, influenced deeply by the ideas of Karl Marx and Lenin. But it gradually expanded. It might be of interest today to recall that N.M. Perera, Colvin R. de Silva, Leslie Goonewardene, Philip Gunawardena and Robert Gunawardena were among the members of the original group.
Efforts were made to break into the working class field, and the group published for several months a Sinhalese paper entitled “Kamkaruwa ”(Worker). In the trade union field the group came into head-on clash with Mr A.E. Goonesinghe the reformist labour leader. (Mr Goonesinghe’s influence, though on the wane, was to persist till the war period.) Excepting the Wellawatte Mills, in this clash Mr Goonesinghe was generally the victor. The young enthusiasts learned in the hard way that the working class does not lightly abandon its traditional leadership.
Efforts in the general political field were more successful. On the initiative of the South Colombo Youth League, the Suriya Mal Movement was launched in November 1933. A couple of years or so previously, in protest against the proceeds of Poppy sales on Armistice Day (November 11th) being used for the benefit of the British ex-servicemen to the detriment of Ceylonese ex-servicemen, a Ceylonese ex-serviceman, Mr Aelian Perera, had started a rival sale of Suriya flowers on this day, the proceeds of which were devoted to help needy Ceylonese ex-servicemen. This movement was revived on a new anti-imperialist and anti-war basis.
Emblazoning the words “Peace ”and “Freedom ”on its banner the new Suriya Mal Movement came into being. Young men and women sold Suriya flowers on the streets on November 11th in competition with the Poppy sellers, yearly until the second world war. The purchasers of the Suriya Mal were generally from the poorer sections of society and the funds collected were not large. But the movement provided a rallying point for the anti-imperialist minded youth of the time. Doreen Wickramasinghe (Mrs S.A. Wickramasinghe) was elected first President of the Suriya Mal Movement at a meeting held at the residence of Wilmot Perera in Horana. Terence N. de Zilva and Robin Ratnam were elected Joint Secretaries, and Roy de Mel Treasurer.
The proceeds of the campaign were utilised for the publication of literature and the education of a child of a depressed community. The Suriya Mal workers also played an important role during the malaria epidemic of 1934-35 in which 125,000 died throughout the country. Bands of Suriya Mal workers encamped in the worst affected areas and did valuable relief work in the malaria-stricken villages.
In this early period, youth leagues were started in various places having as their aim the winning of complete independence for Ceylon. Anti-imperialist propaganda was carried on under the aegis of the youth leagues. Noteworthy was the opposition organised to the campaign of the National Congress Board of Ministers to gain support in the country for their petition to Whitehall. This “Ministers’ Memorandum”, as it came to be known, instead of demanding even Dominion Status for Ceylon only asked for the transfer of more power to the elected Ministers. The Youth Leagues opposed the manoeuvre as an abject capitulation to imperialism. After three or four public meetings, in the face of opposition the Ministers dropped their campaign.
All this preparatory work paved the way for the formation of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. The first members of the party came principally from elements thrown up by the youth leagues and the Suriya Mal movement,
The Party is Launched

    The first manifesto of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party declared that its aims were the achievement of complete national independence, the nationalisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and the abolition of inequalities arising from differences of race, caste, creed or sex.
It is of interest today to note that the partial demands raised at the time included the abolition of child labour, free school books, abolition of irrigation rates, a scheme of unemployment insurance, minimum wage, eight-hour day, rent restriction, slum clearance, the use of Sinhalese and Tamil for proceedings in lower courts and for entries in police stations and the gradual extension of this to all government departments, abolition of the headman system and nationalisation of imports of rice and petrol.
Membership of the party was open to those who subscribed to the party’s aims and paid a subscription of 25 cents a month. Power was vested in an Executive Committee between annual conferences. Colvin R. de Silva was elected President at the inaugural meeting and Vernon Gunasekera was elected Secretary.
The Party succeeded in securing the election of two of its members, Philip Gunawardena (Avissawella) and N.M. Perera (Ruanwella) to the State Council in the General Elections of February-March 1936, Dr S.A. Wickramasinghe, member for Akuressa in the First State Council of 1931, re-contested his seat as LSSP candidate in the General Election of 1936, and lost. Leslie Goonewardene lost his contest at Panadura.
The securing of two seats in the State Council was an invaluable aid to the young party. The two State Councillors fully utilised the legislature as a forum to propagandise the policy of the party and to put forward its view on all important questions as they arose. Their advent was like a waft of fresh air. The walls of the chamber began to echo the cry of the oppressed, the grievances of the workers, the complaints of the rural population, the defiance of those who would not submit to imperialist subjection or capitalist and feudal exploitation and oppression.
The Sinhalese weekly “Samasamajaya ”commenced on July 10th 1936, and edited by B.J. Fernando also played a valuable role. It continued to appear regularly till the press was seized and sealed up by the Government in 1940. The Tamil weekly “Samatharmam ”was commenced in 1938. Its first editor was K. Ramanathan. Later T.E. Pushparajan became the editor.
Bringing Politics to the People

    In order to appreciate and understand the nature of the impact made by the Lanka Sama Samaja Party on the political scene and the role it played in this first period, it is important first of all to realise that politics in the sense we understand it today did not exist at that time in Ceylon. Although universal franchise had existed from 1931, elections did not proceed on party lines, and political issues were hardly raised. Voters used to vote on caste, religious or personal considerations. Politics was really confined to the English educated few, and it was customary for public meetings to be conducted in English.
In a sense it would be true to say that the Lanka Sama Samaja party introduced politics to Ceylon. Certainly it brought politics to the common people, employing a language and terms they could understand. Many words, especially in political terminology, which are in current use today in the Sinhalese language have acquired their meaning thanks to the Sama Samaja movement.
As a matter of fact, when the Lanka Sama Samaja Party was formed there were no accepted words in Sinhalese to describe the words “Socialist ”or “Communist”. That is how the word “Samasamajaya”, coined by Mr Dally Jayawardena in the “Swadesa Mitraya ”of that day to describe the word “Socialist”, came to be chosen. The new term had the added advantage of not being associated with the ideas of reformism that are attached to the English word “Socialist”.
In the period 1935 to 1939, a number of reforms and measures of social amelioration are directly attributable to the agitation of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, both within the State Council and outside. Thus, for example, a million rupees was set apart in 1936 for free meals for school children, a reform of the headman system was set going in 1937 by the abolition of the posts of superior headmen (that is, Ratemahatmayas, Mudliyars, as also Korales and Vidane Arachchies) and a resolution to abolish irrigation rates was accepted by the State Council in 1938 and implemented a year later.
In November 1936, a motion that “in the Municipal and Police Courts of the Island the proceedings should be in the vernacular ”was accepted by the State Council and referred to the Legal Secretary. Needles to say, nothing was done about it. A similar fate attended a motion passed on the same day that “entries in police stations should be recorded in the language in which they are originally stated”. These early efforts to make a beginning in the displacement of English as the language of administration thus went unheeded. The failure to tackle these matters in time was later to give this question of the state language such an explosive form as to threaten the very unity of the Ceylonese nation.
Similarly, another Samasamajist motion “not to grant any recruiting licences under any circumstances whatsoever”, aimed at a ban on Indian immigration, was debated and defeated in September 1937 on the specious plea that there was a shortage of labour in the plantations. This has never, however, prevented the very people who opposed this resolution from attacking the Samasamajists as being “pro-Indian ”and “anti-Ceylonese ”when they have defended the human rights of these plantation workers whom the capitalists themselves had brought from India.
It was about the same time as the formation of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party that a group of young socialists in India, under the leadership of people like Jayaprakash Narain, Ashok Mehta, M.R. Masani and Rammanohar Lohia, had launched the Congress Socialist Party in India. Fraternal relations were established between the two parties and it was probably partly as a result of this that a delegation of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party was invited to and attended the Faizpur Sessions of the Indian National Congress in 1936. In April 1937 Kamaladevi Chattopadyaya, a leader of the Congress Socialist Party and one of the most colourful figures in the Indian national movement, was the guest of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and addressed a large number of meetings in various parts of the country on a national tour. This propaganda campaign helped the newly formed party to popularise itself.
The Bracegirdle Episode

    It was towards the end April 1937 that there occurred an episode that led to the party receiving nation-wide publicity and which first established the party’s reputation as an organisation which fights for democratic rights not only in words but also in deeds.
M.A.L. Bracegirdle, a young Australian, after completing his “creeping ”on a British tea plantation, joined the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and began to participate energetically in its activities. This was too much for the white sahibs of the Plantation raj who considering their prestige was at stake prevailed upon the Governor at the time Sir Reginald Stubbs, to serve an order of deportation on Bracegirdle under a century-old law.
Bracegirdle was served with the order of deportation on April 22nd and given 48 hours to leave by a steamer on which a passage had been booked for him by the Government. The Party with the full concurrence of Bracegirdle decided that the order should be defied. On April 24th the steamer left without Bracegirdle, and there followed a man-hunt throughout the country, in which, despite all efforts of the police Bracegirdle successfully eluded arrest. In parenthesis it may be mentioned that the experience gained in hiding Bracegirdle was valuable for the party for the illegal and underground tasks of the war years.
In the meantime, the matter gained nation-wide publicity with public sympathy increasingly manifesting itself in favour of Bracegirdle. In the party May Day, demonstration that year there were placards declaring “We want Bracegirdle – Deport Stubbs”. The Board of Ministers too began to feel the pressure of mass opinion and protested against the Governor’s action which had been taken without even consulting the Minister of Home Affairs. After 11 days of eluding the police, Bracegirdle made a dramatic re-appearance at a mammoth rally in Colombo on May 5th; a couple of days later he was arrested.
But by now legal preparations had been made. A writ of “Habeas Corpus ”was served, and there ensued a legal battle before a bench of three Supreme Court judges presided over by Chief Justice Sir Sidney Abrahams. The case created legal history. Mr H.V. Perera, Ceylon’s leading civil lawyer, volunteered his services free on behalf of Bracegirdle. In the end on May 18th order was made quashing the Governor’s order of deportation, and Bracegirdle was a free man.
It should not be supposed, however, that the young Sama Samaja Party had an easy path to tread. From the commencement the Ceylonese bourgeoisie recognised in the Lanka Sama Samaja Party its real enemy. Sir Don Baron Jayatilleke commenced the onslaught, acting on the theory, no doubt, that it was always better to nip a thing in the bud. He made it a point to attack the Sama Samaja Party at political and non-political meetings he addressed in various parts of the country, declaring that the Samasamajists were out to destroy religion. One of the results of Sir Baron’s propaganda was that the Lanka Sama Samaja Party began to receive requests for meetings from people in whom interest had been aroused by Sir Baron’s attacks and who desired to hear the other side of the question! Needless to say, the party was only too glad to oblige.
Realising, no doubt, that verbal attacks were not achieving their purpose, the bourgeoisie decided that firmer measures were needed. From 1937 to 1939 a systematic effort was made to disrupt Samasamaja meetings not only by shouting and beating of tom-toms, but by physical attacks by drunken hoodlums armed with clubs and knives. Very often, in those days, holding a public meeting involved elaborate organisation for the defence of the meeting against such attacks. Many meetings resulted in open clashes. The Bulathkohupitiya and Homagama meetings in particular deserve mention as instances where the party showed its determination to defend the right of meeting. In the latter case, as late as February 1939, many were injured on both sides.
Another form of attack resorted to by the bourgeois opponents of the party was the publication of scurrilous literature against the Samasamajist leaders. One particularly indecent paper called “Sinha Handa ”deserves special mention since it was edited by a particularly capable Sinhalese writer of repute who had prostituted his talents to serve his bourgeois masters.
The Trade Union Field

    After the launching of the party, efforts at unionisation of the workers met with greater success than before. Indeed the party was able to take leadership in the spontaneous island-wide two-day strike of the motor workers that took place on the eve of the February 1936 General Election, against the recently promulgated Motor Laws which provided for the cancellation of driving licences for trivial offences.
Trade union work was, however, an uphill task in the face of the opposition of the reformist labour leader Mr Goonesinghe, whose opposition went so far as to supply blacklegs to employers to break strikes led by the Samasamajists. Unionisation, however, went slowly forward among the bus workers, the Ratmalana Railway Workshop workers, and other sections of workers in private establishments. In this period the party provided leadership in strikes of workers of the Admiralty in Trincomalee, the Kolonnawa oil installation, the Colombo Commercial Co. at Hunupitiya, and at other places.
In 1938, however, unionisation suffered a severe setback as the result of a marked growth of anti-Indian sentiment among the Sinhalese workers. Mr. Goonesinghe who had raised the anti-Indian cry in the Wellawatte Mills strike of 1932 made a desperate effort to retain his hold on labour by an anti-Indian campaign. He was greatly assisted in this by Mr J.L. Kotelawala (later Sir John Kotelawala), Minister of Communications and Works, who announced with a fanfare of trumpets that he was getting rid of all Indian workers working under the Government. The campaign to arouse racial hatred was a success. Many work-places in Colombo employed also workers of Indian origin. With division in the ranks of the workers, union organisations collapsed, and it was a simple matter for the employers to impose their own terms on the workers in the workplaces. Even the strong Wellawatte Mill Workers Union was a casualty in this period when union organisation reached a very low level. This was the first example of the successful use of communalism as an organised manoeuvre to disrupt the mass movement. These moods began to change only with the commencement of the war and the strike wave among the plantation workers.
The end of 1939 and the first half of 1940 saw the awakening for the first time of the workers of the plantations. A wave of spontaneous strikes spread throughout the plantations, commencing in November. At the start the issues were generally trivial, such as a discontinuance or a transfer, but basically it was a struggle of the workers to win the right of organisation. There were two principal organisations working among the plantation workers, one the trade union organisation of the Ceylon Indian Congress, and the other the All-Ceylon Estate Workers Union led by the Samasamajists.
In November and December the wave was more or less confined to the Central Province and was by and large under the leadership of the Congress. In this area it reached the zenith in the Mool Oya Estate strike, which was led by the Samasamajists. In this strike, on January 19th 1940, the worker Govindan was shot and killed by the police and became the first of a long list of martyrs of the working class in the plantations. As a result of agitation both within the State Council and outside, the Government was compelled to appoint a Commission of Inquiry. Colvin R. de Silva, who appeared for the widow of Govindan, was able to make a very effective exposure of the combined role of the police and employers in the plantation raj of the white man. The name of Veluchamy, Secretary of All-Ceylon Estate Workers Union, is indissolubly bound up with the Mool Oya strike.
But the raj of the white planters was beginning to crack. After Mool Oya, the plantation strike wave spread southward towards Uva, with the workers showing increasing militancy and determination. The strikes became more prolonged (the strike on St Andrews’ Estate, Talawakelle, continued for 3 months), more basic demands such as wage demands were increasingly raised, and the workers began more and more to seek the militant leadership of the Samasamajists.
When the strike wave reached Uva Province, the Samasamajists were in the leadership. In a desperate effort to stem the tide, the Badulla Magistrate issued an order banning the holding of meetings. On a decision by the party N.M. Perera broke the ban and addressed a mammoth meeting in Badulla on May 12th. The police were powerless to act. Willie Jayatilleke, Edmund Samarakkody and V. Sittampalam4 did invaluable work in the struggle in Uva.
The highest point in the entire struggle was reached on Wewessa Estate where the workers set up their elected council, the Superintendent agreeing to act in consultation with the Workers’ Council. An armed police party that went to restore “law and order ”was disarmed by the workers, and on the orders of the workers’ council the rifles were returned to the policemen on their furnishing a signed receipt.
Finally, of course, the strike wave was beaten back by the police. This was facilitated by floods which cut off Uva from the rest of the country for over a week. And the police specially took their revenge on the heroic Wewessa workers by a literal armed invasion of the estate followed by a rule of terror which compelled scores of workers to seek refuge in the jungle for several days.
The militant leadership provided by the party made a deep impression among the plantation workers. But the party was never able to build on this goodwill because firstly, repression descended on the party immediately afterwards, leaving the trade union field in the plantations free to the Ceylon Indian Congress; and secondly because even after the war, the measures of the Government against workers of Indian origin drove these workers quite naturally in the circumstances into the arms of the Ceylon Indian Congress.
    Chapter 2 – War and Repression
Trotskyism and Stalinism

    The Second World War, which commenced in September 1939, brought many changes for the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. But in the first place, it accelerated changes within it.
For some time past, most of the leaders of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party had been disturbed by certain international developments, such as the Moscow Trials and the Popular Front line of the Communist Parties of the West. They could not believe that the confessions in the trials were genuine and felt compelled to come to the conclusion that they were gigantic frame-ups. The line of the Popular Front, especially in Spain, appeared to be dictated, not by the needs of the Spanish Revolution, but by the foreign policy needs of the Soviet Government. The line of the National Front, prescribed for colonial countries, seemed to subserve the same aim. In other words, the Third (Communist) International, founded by Lenin in 1919 to give help and guidance to the socialist revolution throughout the world, had apparently degenerated into an abject instrument of Stalin’s changing foreign policies. A careful reading of Trotsky’s “Revolution Betrayed ” (first available in English in 1938) also had a profound effect on the leaders of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party.
The support of the war for some weeks by the Communist Parties of Britain and France who were faithfully following the People’s War line of the Popular Front and their abrupt change of line into one of opposition to the war, presumably on instructions from abroad, underlined the need for an early clarification of the question within the Lanka Sama Samaja Party.
Accordingly the following resolution was presented to and adopted by the Executive Committee of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party: “Since the 3rd International has not acted in the interests of the international revolutionary working class movement, while expressing its solidarity with the Soviet Union, the first workers’ state, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party declares that it has no faith in the 3rd International. ”29 voted for, and 5 against the resolution. Among those voting against were S.A. Wickramasinghe and M.G. Mendis who had for some time, along with Jack Kotalawela, served as Joint Secretary of the party.
The clash between the Trotskyists and the Stalinists now came into the open in the party. Shortly afterwards, the Stalinists were expelled. This was possibly the first occasion in the history of party expulsions where the Trotskyists expelled the Stalinists, and not the reverse.
The Executive Committee of the party also adopted a new programme and constitution. Hitherto the programme of the party had been vague. Now a clear revolutionary programme was adopted, in line with the programme of the 4th International, founded by Trotsky in 1938. The old constitution had granted membership to all those who paid a subscription of 25 cents a month. The new constitution limited membership to those who paid a monthly subscription according to ability to pay, and who engaged in party activity as members in a party group or local organisation. An effort was thus made to convert the party from a loose body of individuals into a fighting organisation.
How timely the change was, is shown by the repression that descended on the party immediately afterwards. Further, one dreads to think what the position would have been if the Stalinists had remained within the party till 1941, when the Soviet Union entered the war against Germany.
Their change of position from opposition to support of the war and their policy of branding as traitors those who opposed the war would have paralysed the party if they had been within it. As it was, the party entered the dark period of war repression armed with the ideological and organisational weapons needed for the tasks and problems it had to face.
The Underground Period

    The Lanka Sama Samaja Party had from the start characterised the war as an imperialist war and opposed Ceylon’s participation in it. What this opposition to the war meant in practice was the prosecution of the class struggle in disregard of any adverse consequences that might result therefrorn to the war effort. Furthermore, Hitler was marking time in the winter of 1939-40 and the war had not yet started in real earnest. Consequently perhaps our imperialist rulers still felt they could ignore the Sama Samaja Party.
However, the situation changed in the first half of 1940. On the one band, the Samasamajists were proving to be a definite hindrance to the war effort with their militant leadership of the plantation workers’ struggles. The strikes in Uva took place in April-May 1940. And then came the fall of Paris on June 13th. Within a week the Government acted.
Detention orders were issued on N.M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena, Colvin R. de Silva, Edmund Samarakkody and Leslie Goonewardene. The party press was raided and sealed. Regulations were promulgated which made open party work practically impossible. J.C.T. Kotelawala was party Secretary at the time.
The party, however, was not caught napping. The cover organisation of the party, of which Doric de Souza and senanayake">Reggie Senanayake principally were in charge, had been active for some months.5 N.M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena and Colvin R. de Silva were arrested on June 18th and Edmund Samarakkody on June 19th. But Leslie Goonewardene on prior instructions of the party, evaded arrest and went underground. The cover organisation of the party enabled him, to work for a period of one year and three months till he left for India. Despite a prize offered for his capture all the efforts of the police to arrest him proved unsuccessful.
The party press was sealed and guarded. But the “Samasamajaya”, printed at the secret party press and produced at first on a two-page sheet, began to appear. The Tamil and English illegal sheets also appeared at irregular intervals. Illegal leaflets too were distributed.
On June 23rd a mass meeting called by the party to protest against the arrests of the party leaders and held despite a police ban, was broken up by the police. Eleven people, including Selina Perera, Reggie Perera and Boyd Wickremasinghe, were arrested and charged in this connection.
While on the one hand repression was being unleashed in this manner against the Samasamajists for the opposition to the war, it might be noted in parenthesis that the State Council assembled on June 27th and passed without a single dissentient voice a vote of Rs. 5 million as a contribution to the war effort or the Imperial Government. It should be added however that in 1941 when Mr George E. de Silva brought a resolution in the State Council demanding the release of the Samasamajist detenus, the resolution was only just defeated, 14 voting for, 15 voting against and 8 declining to vote.
The reorganisation of the party in a manner suitable to the new, illegal conditions went forward. Special mention should be made of the indefatigable work under the most trying conditions of Henry Peiris who was the editor of “Samasamajaya ”during the entire illegal period.6 On April 20th 1941, a secret conference, attended by 42 delegates, was held. Leslie Goonewardene, who was in hiding, also attended this conference at which the new programme and constitution were adopted.
The party actively participated in the strike wave of the urban workers which commenced in May 1941 and affected the workers of the Colombo Harbour, Granaries, Wellawatte Mills, Gas Company, Colombo Municipality and Fort-Mount Lavinia bus route. This openly functioning section of the party was led by Robert Gunawardena, S.C.C. Anthonipillai, V. Karalasingham, K.V. Lourenz Perera and William Silva. A legal Sinhalese weekly, “Kamkaruwa”, was published to aid these struggles, till the paper was ultimately banned by Admiral Layton. The English paper “Straight Left ”was also published in this period.
In mid-1941 the war between the Soviet Union and Germany broke out, as a result of Hitler’s treacherous attack. But the Lanka Sama Samaja Party stuck firmly to the view that this did not alter the imperialist character of the war waged by Britain against Germany (and later along with the United States against Italy and Japan as well). It held that support of the war and postponement of the struggle for independence not only would constitute a betrayal of the struggle against imperialism but also would, in the last resort, be not to the advantage of the Soviet Union itself.
Escape from Jail

    A sensation was caused throughout the country when on the night of April 7th 1942 the four detenus escaped from jail along with one of their jail guards, by name Solomon. Subsequent official inquiries were unable to establish how this jail-break succeeded. Today, 18 years later, there is no harm in making public the fact that this was not the first occasion when the detenus had left the jail. On two previous occasions also they had left the jail in the night for all night consultations with the party and had returned to jail before dawn. On this occasion, however, there was no return.
As was to be expected, the repression was intensified after the jail-break. Up to now, although the Lanka Sama Samaja Party had been compelled in practice to work as an illegal organisation, it had not been formally illegalised. It was now declared to be an illegal organisation. A new wave of arrests took place. Among those immediately arrested and detained under the Defence Regulations were Jack Kotelawala, Terence N. de Zilva, Willie Jayatilleke, P. Veluchamy, H.A.C. Wickremaratne, Boyd Wickremasinghe, Martin Silva and Stanley Mendis. There were, of course, many others arrested and charged for specific offences.
A large number of other warrants for arrest and detention were made, and with the failure to find the wanted persons, in addition to the detenus who had escaped, the following also were proclaimed and attachment of their property ordered: Leslie Goonewardene and his wife Vivienne Goonewardene, Selina Perera (wife of N.M. Perera), Kusuma Gunawardena (wife of Philip Gunawardena),  Robert Gunawardena, Reggie Senanayake,  Reggie Perera, V. Karalasingham, P.H. William Silva, S.C.C. Anthonipillai, Lionel D. Cooray and K.V. Lourenz Perera. Many of these people were subsequently arrested and detained.
Soon after the jail-break, the detenus left illegally for India, with the exception of Edmund Samarakkody, who stayed behind. At this time, the struggle for independence was brewing in India, and many other warranted party members also left for India to participate in the struggle. For, it was generally realised that the impending open revolt against imperialism in India was going to be decisive for the future not only of India but of Ceylon as well.
Formation of the  Bolshevik Leninist Party of India

    It should also be mentioned that for some time past the party had been in touch with Trotskyist groups in various parts of India, and had been playing an important part in bringing them together. Preparatory work had been done in this connection by V. Balasingham,7 Doric de Souza, Bernard Soysa and later Leslie Goonewardene. In April 1942, the Bolshevik Leninist Party of India was formed, as a section of the 4th International, with the Lanka Sama Samaja Party as its Ceylon unit,
This organisational connection was to continue for some years till, after the transfer of power in India in 1947 and in Ceylon in 1948, such an organisational connection ceased to have any meaning. The Ceylon party then became a directly affiliated section of the Fourth International.
The Ceylonese Samasamajists who went to India participated actively along with the Bolshevik Leninist Party, in the struggle for independence that commenced in August 1942 in India. Some of them underwent great hardships. A case in point is that of Hector Abeywardena who, released on parole from detention in Ceylon, crossed over to India disguised as a Christian priest, and later nearly died of smallpox in a remote village in Gujerat.
In 1943 the Indian police succeeded in arresting a number of the Samasamajists in India. Philip Gunawardena, his wife Kusuma and their infant child were arrested in Bombay and were kept in Worli jail for several weeks before being sent to Ceylon. N.M. Perera was arrested in Ahmedabad. Bernard Soysa spent 50 days in the Bombay police lock-up before being sent to Ceylon. Others arrested in 1943 were Lionel Cooray in Bombay and Robert Gunawardena, Reggie Senanayake and the ex-jail guard Solomon in Madras. V. Karalasingham, Allan Mendis, Doric de Souza, and S.C.C. Anthonipillai were arrested and detained much later. S.C.C. Anthonipillai and Allan Mendis were released from an Indian jail only in 1946, a year after the conclusion of the war. Colvin R. de Silva, Leslie Goonewardene, Vivienne Goonewardene and Selina Perera succeeded in evading arrest up to the end.
The arrested Ceylonese were ultimately brought back to Ceylon and placed in the detention jail at Badulla. Robert Gunawardena, whose leg had been broken by the Indian police while attempting to escape from custody, was admitted to the General Hospital, Colombo, where he was chained to his bed and also guarded day and night. N.M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena and Edmund Samarakkody, who had been arrested in Ceylon, were charged in 1944 with escaping from jail and sentenced to 6 months rigorous imprisonment.
Tribute should be paid to the numbers of unnamed Samasamajists who underwent imprisonment, police persecution and hardship in the war period. It is their revolutionary determination that kept the party going even in the darkest days. Special mention should be made of Hemasiri Silva and Daniel Weerasena who were sentenced to 6 years and 7 years imprisonment respectively. P.A.E. Perera, publisher of the “Samasamajaya”, was warranted and went into hiding. Ill, he entered hospital unknown. And dying there, his last words were “Long live the Revolution! Tell Comrade Robert!”
No account of the war period would be complete without something being said of the work of a group of worker members who concentrated their activities on organising the workers and giving them a militant leadership at a time when the Stalinists with every encouragement from the imperialists, were building their trade unions on the basis of support of the war effort. Needless to say, this type of work was very difficult. Being semi-open, it had to be conducted in constant danger of police raids and arrests.
This group was led by G.P. Perera (better known as Elephant Perera because of his leadership in 1942 of a 3 months’ struggle of the workers of the Elephant cigarette company along with Selina Perera), and included among others T.W.R. (Rathu) Wijesinghe,8 W.J. (Hospital) Perera, J. Wanigatunga, Thiratnadasa (Bappa), George Perera (Chumbi), Samarawickrama, Ariyadasa, Kasi Udayam, David Perera (Hoare David)9 and Krishnan. It led several strikes including the hospital workers’ general strike of 1944, and was responsible for the party capturing the leadership of the government workers’ unions in Colombo.
With the conclusion of the war against Germany, public pressure for the release of the detenus increased, and on May 30, 1945 the State Council passed a resolution, moved by Mr A.P. Jayasuriya, recommending the unconditional release of the detenus. On this occasion only two British nominated members voted against. However, the detenus were not to be released at once. At first efforts m ere made to persuade them to sign conditions. The detenus stoutly refused to give any such undertaking. Finally, it was after a two-day hunger strike by the detenus on June 18-19 that they were unconditionally released on June 24.
Some of the detenus had been released earlier on grounds of health, while some were under detention in hospital, When the gates of the Badulla detention prison were opened. those who still remained inside were N.M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena, Terence N. de Zylva, William Silva, H.A.C. Wickramaratne, Willie Jayatilleke, Reggie Perera, Martin Silva, P. Veluchamy, S. Kulatilleke, B. Waidyasekera and S.B. Peiris. Colvin R. de Silva, Leslie Goonewardene and Vivienne Goonewardene only returned to Ceylon in November, after the conclusion of the war with Japan, when warrants against them were withdrawn. Selina Perera stayed back to work in India as also did Anthonipillai.
The released detenus were bailed as heroes and given receptions throughout the country. The Lanka Sama Samaja Party, which its enemies had thought had been smashed by the repression, now emerged stronger than ever before and with a tremendous prestige.
    Chapter 3 – 1945 to 1950
The Post War Upsurge

    As happened after the First World War so also after the Second, resentment against the sufferings and privations of as well as the new lessons learned from the experiences of the war years led in most countries to a powerful upsurge of the mass movement. Ceylon was no exception. Although the upsurge did not reach revolutionary heights as in several countries, the pent-up feelings of the masses burst forth in a variety of ways with the relaxation of the repressive restrictions of the war period.,
The Lanka Sama Samaja Party played an important part giving guidance and direction to this upsurge. To be sure the biggest upsurge was in the working class movement. But it would be a mistake to suppose that this awakening was confined to the workers. It manifested itself in various ways among all sections of the common people.
The peasant cultivators of the countryside were chafing under the war-time regulation under which they were compelled to sell their surplus paddy to Government at the rate of Rs. 8/- per bushel. The Lanka Sama Samaja Party was quick to place itself behind the demand for the abolition of this war-time practice and for the raising of the price of a bushel of paddy. In late 1945 under its leadership there was organised the All-Ceylon Peasant Congress which conducted an agitation in the rural areas on this question. The Hewagam Korale branch of this organisation launched a direct action struggle under which peasant cultivators refused to hand over their paddy to Government. Court action was filed against hundreds and some went to jail. In 1946 the Congress organised a peasant march to the State Council, which was a success. It was after this agitation that the then Minister of Agriculture, Mr D.S. Senanayake substituted the system of purchase of paddy by CAP Societies for the old system of compulsory collections by Government.
It was also in this period that there occurred the free education struggle. In the middle of 1945 the State Council had adopted the Free Education Bill brought by the then Minister of Education, Mr C.W.W. Kannangara. While the Lanka Sama Samaja Party certainly cannot claim credit for this piece of legislation it might be noted that, in spite of the disability of illegality, the party was not behind the times even on this question. While in jail in 1944 N.M. Perera wrote a small book entitled “Free Education ”which urged the adoption of a system of free education in Ceylon.
Under the Bill, the managements of the various schools were given the option of coming into the scheme. While most schools came into the scheme, some chose to continue as fee-levying schools. There were a number of strikes of students in such schools (supported by the common people of the area) to compel the managements to enter the scheme and provide a free education for the children. The LSSP participated actively in this movement.
The existing State Council had been elected as far back as 1936 and had long since ceased to be representative of the people. With the example of Britain and other countries holding elections even before the conclusion of the war, the case for an immediate general election in Ceylon was unanswerable. The leaders of the Ceylonese bourgeoisie, however, showed no appreciation of this need. The party accordingly placed itself at the head of the agitation for an immediate dissolution of the unrepresentative State Council and for fresh elections.
It was in this immediate post-war period, too, that the United National Party was started. Hitherto the Ceylonese bourgeoisie had utilised the Ceylon National Congress as their political instrument. However, Mr D.S. Senanayake, the most powerful leader of the Ceylonese capitalists, had left the Ceylon National Congress in the period of the war as a protest against the decision of the Congress at that time to admit the Stalinists into its fold. Further, the Ceylon National Congress had long since been a Sinhalese organisation, where as Mr Senanayake saw the need for having a national party including also the Tamils in order to increase his bargaining power in the forthcoming discussions with the British Government on constitutional reforms. And finally there was also the fact that the Ceylon National Congress, discredited in the eyes of the public, had been reduced almost to an empty shell. Accordingly, under the leadership of Mr D.S. Senanayake the United National Party was launched in June 1946 in preparation for the General Election which was fixed for 1947.
The Lanka Sama Samaja Party unhesitatingly characterised the new party as the political party of the Ceylonese bourgeoisie. It further described it as an agency of imperialism in Ceylon and warned the masses against placing the slightest trust in it. As the Lanka Sama Samaja Party had been the only political party in Ceylon to oppose the war of the imperialists, so also it was the only party in Ceylon in this period to call upon the masses to fight intransigently against the United National Party as the arch enemy of the people.10
From that time up to now, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party can proudly lay claim to having been, of all political parties, the most consistent and determined opponent of the United National Party.
Working Class Struggles

    The end of the War Saw a wave of workers’ strikes. On September 19th 1945 there was a spontaneous strike of 10,000 Colombo workers who demanded to see the Board of Ministers. After a prolonged tramways strike, the strike spread to the harbour and other places in November. In these initial actions, most of the workers who participated belonged to unions affiliated to the Ceylon Trade Union Federation, controlled by the Communist Party. However, the political line of the Communist Party prevented them from giving a militant lead to the workers. Their role in these actions was generally the tailist one of trying to get the workers back on the promise of some minor concession.
On November 22nd the Samasamajist-led union of motor workers launched its island-wide bus strike. N.M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena, Somaweera Chandrasiri, W.J. Perera, George Perera and Leslie Goonewardene (who had just returned to Ceylon from India) were arrested and prosecuted for supporting a strike in an essential service. The strike was a success, and the most stubbornly anti-union section of the capitalists in Ceylon, namely, the bus owners, were compelled to make important concessions.
In this early post-war period the Lanka Sama Samaja re-commenced its trade union activity in cooperation with the Workers’ and Peasants’ Union of A. Gunasakera who at that time was the leader of a group known as the Radical Party.11 The Ceylon Federation of Labour, which had been registered as a federation of unions by this group, was taken over by the Samasamajists. Unorganised workers sought unionisation under party leadership. Important unions, such as the Harbour and Dock Workers Union, were formed as a result of the militant leadership given by the LSSP in the course of strikes. In the Jaffna peninsula, the organisations of all the bus workers and other sections of workers, under the leadership of C. Tharmakulasingham, came over to the LSSP, giving the party for the first time a working class base in the North.12 And finally several unions which had accepted the leadership of the Communist Party during the war came over to the Samasamajists.
In a bid to avert the great struggle of the Government workers that was preparing under the leadership of the LSSP-led Government Workers’ Trade Union Federation, in December 1945 the Government voted an extra Rs. 6 million to increase the wages of Government workers. But this altered nothing.
In 1946 at the tail end of a stubborn two months old of the bank clerks, the first General Strike took place. On October 16th the Government workers struck. The railway strike was well-nigh complete and of itself brought many establishments to a standstill. The strike was soon extended to the Harbour, the Gas Company, Municipal workers and various private firms. The official figure given by the Government of the number of strikers was only 24,000. But the real figure was probably twice as large. The Lanka Sama Samaja Party, controlling as it did the unions of the Government workers, who were the backbone of the strike, was in effective leadership of the strike. But a central strike committee was formed to lead the strike, composed of representatives of all participating unions and parties.
For several days the Government refused to negotiate. But when the strike continued with undiminished strength, gradually bringing economic life to a standstill, the Acting Governor on October 21st agreed to meet a deputation of the Government Workers’ Trade Union Federation. The deputation was permitted to bring along one adviser with them and the Federation chose N.M. Perera for this function.
However, on the following day, shortly before the time fixed for the interview with the Acting Governor, N.M. Perera was arrested by the police, quite clearly for the purpose of preventing him from participating in the negotiations. The workers’ delegation went to Queen’s House and met the Acting Governor, but refused to come to a settlement in the absence of N.M. Perera. In the end N.M. Perera had to be released and negotiated a settlement together with the delegation of the Federation. The Government workers’ strike was settled on the promise of several important concessions. However, some of these promises were not honoured, and provided the reason for the Second General Strike of the following year. After this settlement, settlements were negotiated with the employers in other sectors.
The conducting of the General Strike of 1946 enormously increased the prestige of the party generally and particularly among the workers. It accelerated greatly the process of integration of the party in the working class and its development into a working class party in the true sense of the word.
The Second General Strike, taking place at the end of May and early June 1947, was not such a success and ended in defeat. It came about as a result of the broadening out of a strike of engineering workers, the government workers coming into the struggle because of the unfulfilled promises of the previous year. But the strike of the railway workers was not complete and the trains continued to run. On the other hand the Government clerks came out on strike under the leadership of their organisation, the Government Clerical Service Union. Also, the unions of the Communist-led Ceylon Trade Union Federation came out in greater strength than the previous year. As previously, a central strike committee was appointed to conduct the strike. However, on this occasion the attitude of the Government as well as private employers was much stiffer, and they refused to negotiate.
On June 5th, a procession of several thousands of strikers, for which permission had been duly obtained, was proceeding with N.M. Perera at its head, when a large force of police barred its passage at Dematagoda and baton charged it. N.M. Perera was knocked down and beaten while on the ground. The police also fired 25 rounds into the demonstration, as a result of which 18 were injured and 1 killed. The martyr was V. Kandasamy, a Government clerk.
This act of repression, while it roused the resentment of the masses generally, had a damping effect on the strike itself. After a few days most of the clerks had returned to work. The workers stuck out longer, but in the end sections of them too returned to work. Ultimately the strike was officially called off. The strike was not only a defeat, it was a smash-up. Thousands of Government clerks, Government workers and workers in private employment were victimised. A Public Security Bill giving the Government various repressive powers had also been rushed through the State Council in the latter days of the strike.
After the defeat of the General Strike of 1947 the trade union movement entered a period of ebb. This slump was to continue for some years. As it had done on the occasion of the formation of the United National Party, so also in this situation the Lanka Sama Samaja Party correctly discharged its responsibility to the mass movement. While drawing the political lessons of the defeat, it warned the workers against adventurist struggles and explained that this was now a period in which the workers had patiently to rebuild their shattered organisations in preparation for the next wave of struggles.13
The Split in the LSSP

    In the latter period of the war, after the escape of the leaders from jail in 1942, a faction struggle developed within the party. There were no differences in regard to programme or policy. The differences centred mainly around organisational questions. One faction called itself the Bolshevik-Leninist faction and declared that the other faction was attempting to dilute the party and convert it into a loose organisation. The other faction, calling itself the Workers Opposition, declared that the party machine had been captured by a group of intellectuals who were obstructing the expansion of the party among the working class.
After the release of the leaders from jail and the re-commencement of open mass activity the split became open, and two groups began to function in the name of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. While N.M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena, and Robert Gunawardena were among those who associated themselves with one group, Doric de Souza, Edmund Samarakkody, Bernard Soysa and William Silva were among those who associated themselves with the other group. The Bolshevik Leninist Party of India, of which the LSSP was a unit, continued to recognise as its Ceylon unit the organisation with which it had maintained contact throughout the war years, and on October 8th 1945 took the step of expulsion of N.M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena from the party. When this decision was announced in the newspapers on behalf of the Bureau of the Bolshevik Leninist Party of India by a letter signed by Colvin R. de Silva and Leslie Goonewardene, the split in Ceylon became definitive, and for the time being not capable of healing.
The split in the LSSP was very unfortunate and prevented the LSSP from reaping the full benefits of a period in which the general popularity and prestige of the Samasamajists was very high after its principled and fearless opposition to imperialism in the war years. This fact was, indeed, realised generally, and a short-lived attempt at unity was made at the end of 1946 which failed after a few months. However, one gain achieved during this short period of unity was the nomination of candidates for the forthcoming, General Election, Fortunately both parties adhered to this list of candidates, so that no clash occurred between the two Trotskyist parties in the general election of 1947.
Some time after the failure of this early attempt at reunification, the LSSP which was recognised by the BLPI, realising the confusion arising from two parties using the same name, and recognising that the other and larger party was considered in fact by the masses to be the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, decided to change its name to Bolshevik Samasamaja Party.
The months and years that followed, however, only demonstrated that there were absolutely no principled political differences between the two organisations and that this division in the ranks of the Trotskyists was not only being exploited by rivals in the political field but was proving a distinct advantage to the class enemy. The Gampaha by-election in 1949, in which both the Trotskyist parties contested, led not only to an easy victory for the United National Party, but to unfortunate physical clashes between the two Trotskyist parties. The desire for unity grew in both parties, and in early 1950 a joint council of both parties was set up, to co-ordinate the public activities or both parties with the perspective of unification within a period of six months.
Before the middle of the year the Lanka Sama Samaja Party by a majority decision and the Bolshevik Samasamaja Party unanimously decided to unify under the name of Lanka Sama Samaja Party and at a Joint Conference held on June 4th 1950 formal unification was achieved. T.B. Subasinghe was elected Secretary.
Unfortunately many of those who had voted in the LSSP against the unification proposal split away and under the leadership of Philip Gunawardena set themselves up as a separate organisation using the same name. The capitalist press, which has always opposed the party, utilised the situation to try to give the party a new name, namely Nava (New) Lanka Sama Samaja Party, in order to create the impression that it was a new party and not the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. History, however, has long since given its verdict on this question. And the verdict has been against the editors of the capitalist newspapers.
The 1947 Elections

    The 1947 General Election was held under the new Soulbury Constitution. Held from August 23rd to September 20th that year, it took the shape of a struggle against the United National Party. The United National Party for its part, recognising in the LSSP its principal enemy, concentrated its attack on the Samasamajists. Huge posters depicting burning temples, churches or mosques declared: “Save the Country from the Samasamaja Fire. ”The main burden of UNP propaganda was that the Samasamajists would destroy religion.
The masses, however, closed their ranks in a struggle to defeat the UNP. Even the Communist Party, which had entered the election campaign supporting the UNP against the LSSP, was compelled to modify its position.14
A noticeable feature of the campaign was the enthusiastic manner in which particularly those workers who had participated in the General Strike a few months earlier threw themselves into the election struggle. The very defeat of their economic struggle appeared to have driven them to seek a political solution of their problems. Especially the demand for the reinstatement of the victimised workers in the General Strike played an important part in the election. This demand, in fact, continued to be an issue in all subsequent elections, up to and including the General Election of 1956.
As stated earlier, the two Trotskyist parties did not clash, the division of seats arranged during the brief period of unity being adhered to by both organisations. Both parties contested a total of 38 seats. The LSSP won 10 seats, while the other LSSP (which soon after the elections became the Bolshevik Samasamaja Party) won 5 seats. The UNP won 42 seats, the CP 3, the Ceylon Indian Congress 7, the Tamil Congress 7, and Independents 20. The LSSP thus emerged as the second largest party, next to the UNP.
The result or the election had not really been a victory for the UNP. Although it had won 42 out of a total of 95 elected seats, it did not seem possible for it to obtain a working majority. The situation was really resolved by the Governor, who called upon Mr D.S. Senanayake to form the government. With 6 nominated members added to the UNP figure, the total came to 48, and after that it was not difficult to get the support of several Independents, and later of the Tamil Congress.
In the Parliament of 1947 the role of leadership of the Opposition devolved in fact on the LSSP as the second largest party. However, it was not till the unification of the two Trotskyist parties in 1950 that it was possible, with the cooperation of the MPs of the Bolshevik Samasamaja Party which was then obtained, to secure for the leader of the LSSP Parliamentary Group the official position of Leader of the Opposition in Parliament.
In the election of Senators by the House the LSSP was able to secure the election of W.K. Jinadasa, and the BSP of D.W.J. Perera as senators. It is worthy of note that the first motion moved by D.W.J. Perera in the Senate was a motion calling for the abolition of that body!
The new mass position gained by the LSSP in the post-war period brought with it its own organisational problems. We had remarked earlier that during the war the party had altered its constitution so as to limit its membership to those who engaged in some regular activity as members of a party group or organisation. On the other hand this raised the problem of maintaining adequate contact with a very wide layer of conscious supporters of the party both in town and countryside. The party organisation was far too small for this task.
A solution to this problem was found in practice by the form of organisation called the Sama Samaja Youth League. This is a peripheral organisation of the party and is composed of people who accept the leadership of the party but do not have to conform to the strict rules which apply to party membership. These leagues are formed on a territorial basis and establish close ties with the people of the area by taking up local issues.
The first conference of these Youth Leagues was held in 1949 when Philip Gunawardena was elected President and Basil Silva Secretary of the All-Island Congress of Sama Samaja Youth Leagues. These youth leagues were first formed principally from the members of the peasant organisation to which we had occasion to refer earlier. After the unification of the two Trotskyist parties in 1950 this Sama Samaja Youth League movement grew by leaps and bounds with a wide network reaching even remote parts of the country. It must be stated that in all political struggles that have taken place in the past ten years, whether they be election struggles or direct struggles like the Great Hartal of 1953, the Youth Leagues have played an exceedingly important role and have served as the main link between the party and the masses.
    Chapter 4 – Ebb and Revival
Consolidation of the Right

    The years following 1947 witnessed a consolidation of the forces of the Right under the leadership of the UNP and a stagnation of the mass movement. There were several reasons for this.
In the first place, in February 1948 there occurred the transfer of power by the British. Ceylon acquired the status of a Dominion by the Governor becoming a constitutional head without arbitrary powers and the Ceylon Parliament becoming a sovereign body. This change of policy on the part of British Imperialism had been brought about by the mass struggles for independence that had taken place in the countries of South East Asia and more particularly in the neighbouring British possessions of India and Burma. The bourgeois leaders of Ceylon represented the matter as evidence of the success of their policy of cooperation with the imperialists. Whether the people accepted this explanation or not the fact remained that political power had indeed been transferred to Ceylon, and this helped to strengthen the UNP.15
In the second place, the boom conditions, particularly in relation to rubber, that came during the years of the Korean War, placed the Government in a financially good position and enabled it to grant many concessions to the masses in this period. The reduction in the price of rationed rice to 25 cents a measure in 1951 and the increase in the price paid by the Government to the peasants for their paddy, from Rs. 8/- to Rs. 9/- a bushel in 1951, and from Rs. 9/- to Rs. 12/- in 1952, are deserving of special mention.
Finally it should be noted that in this period for the first time in Ceylon’s history there was built a bourgeois party with a mass following. The Ceylonese bourgeoisie, which is predominantly a plantation bourgeoisie, had slept during the war years when its big brother in India was leading an oppositional movement to imperialism. It was awakened only after the war when it saw the upsurge of the masses with the Samasamajists in the vanguard and instinctively recognised the threat that this represented to its very existence. Earlier, the bourgeois leaders of Ceylon, distrustful and a little afraid of the masses, had generally avoided mass political meetings. Now they began to compete with the Leftists in open air rallies, even though in most cases the masses had to be provided with free transport to attend them. Mass membership drives were made, and a streamlined electoral machine was set up. The lack of self-sacrifice in the rank and file workers was compensated for by the funds which national and foreign capitalists were only too ready to contribute. The Ceylonese bourgeoisie, scared into activity by the “Red Danger”, and utilising all the advantages that accrued to it from being in control of the state machine, built the United National Party as the bastion of capitalist and imperialist interests in Ceylon. They were also responsible for the many reactionary features of the Soulbury Constitution which loaded the dice against working class parties in parliamentary politics.
It was in this period too that the Government introduced a series of repressive legislative and administrative measures calculated to cripple the mass movement and the workers’ movement in particular. Even before the elections of 1947, towards the end of the unsuccessful General Strike of that year, the Government had rushed through the Public Security Ordinance and the Police Amendment Ordinance. Soon after, in the early period of the first Parliament, the notorious administrative regulation 208 B, which placed a ban on all public servants engaging in political activity of any sort, was passed. In 1948 an amendment to the Trade Union Act placed a number of restrictions on the trade unions of public servants, including even a denial of their right to form a federation of unions of such public servants. Soon after, came the Citizenship Acts and an amendment to the Constitution which denied the franchise to several hundreds of thousands of plantation workers of Indian origin who had exercised the vote since 1931, and imposed such conditions as made it impossible for all but a small fraction of these workers to obtain Ceylon citizenship. Needless to say the Lanka Sama Samaja Party opposed all these repressive and anti-democratic measures of the Government.
We noted earlier that the Trotskyist parties had united in 1950. This was an important occurrence. It gave new hope and courage to thousands. The united Lanka Sama Samaja Party grew in numbers, strengthened its organisation and expanded its activities. But all this could not reverse the historical ebb that was taking place. This was illustrated in the Balangoda by-election in April 1951, where the LSSP candidate fought the UNP candidate and was defeated by a very large majority.
Nor was the situation materially altered by the split-away of Mr S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and his group from the UNP in July 1951. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party was formed almost immediately afterwards as a Centre Party with a programme of moderate reforms. Whether the newly formed party broke more support from the Left or from the Right is a matter for speculation. But of this there can be no doubt. The split-away from the UNP did not succeed in reversing the general trend to the Right.
The 1952 Elections

    It was in this context that the General Election of 1952 took place. With the sudden death of Mr D.S. Senanayake in March 1952 and the succession to the premiership of his son, Mr Dudley Senanayake, the latter decided to seek a mandate from the country, and fixed the General Election for May 24th, 26th, 28th and 30th.
As early as November 1951 the LSSP had written to the SLFP asking for a meeting to discuss the elimination of contests in the General Election which was even at that time considered a distinct possibility. No reply was at the time received to this letter. However, with the dissolution of Parliament, representatives of the two parties met for the above-mentioned purpose. It was not found possible to avoid a number of clashes, and the discussions were, generally speaking, unsuccessful. But it was decided to issue a statement pointing out the quite large number of seats in which clashes had been avoided.
Discussions with the Communist Party were even less successful. At this time the Communist Party was working in a united front called the CP-LSSP United Front, which had been formed with those LSSPers who, under the leadership of Philip Gunawardena, had split away at the time of the unification in 1950. The discussions with the CP-LSSP United Front consisted largely of an effort to see whether programmatic agreement was possible. This was found to be not possible.16
The Party contested the elections with a 14-point anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist programme under the slogan of a Samasamaja Government. This slogan, however, did not have anything but a propaganda value, since only 40 seats were contested out of a total of 95. As for the UNP, realising that the issue of religion which they had raised in 1947 would no longer work, except among the Catholics, they concentrated on the Indian question. Their main attack on the Left generally and the LSSP in particular was that the Samasamajists were pro-Indian and would betray Ceylon to India.
The elections resulted in a big victory for the UNP, which won 54 seats, thus obtaining a clear majority in Parliament. Whereas in the 1947 elections 98 of its candidates had obtained 751,432 votes, in the 1952 elections 81 candidates obtained 1,026,025 votes. The SLFP contested 48 seats, won 9 seats and obtained a little over 3 lakhs of votes. The LSSP contested 40 seats, won 9 seats, and obtained a little over 3 lakhs of votes, that is to say, practically the same number of votes as were obtained by the 38 candidates of both the Trotskyist parties in 1947. The CP-LSSP United Front contested 19 seats and won 4 seats, obtaining 134,528 votes.
Many reasons have been advanced to account for the victory of the UNP in 1952, such as the disfranchisement of nearly 200,000 workers of Indian origin, the clash between the anti-UNP parties of the Centre and Left, the better organisation of the UNP, and the sympathy for the new Prime Minister after the death of his father. While all these factors were present, some more important than others, it would be incorrect to ignore that the principal political factor was a noticeable turn to the Right on the part of the voters.
The LSSP and the SLFP had each won 9 seats. But the position of Leadership of the Opposition which the LSSP had held in the first parliament, now went to the SLFP, the MPs of the CP-LSSP United Front backing the candidature of Mr S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike for this post.
The UNP victory naturally had a dampening effect on the masses generally. It had repercussions within the party too, as we shall see later. Some of the weaker elements in the party began to wobble. A good example of this was the case of W. Dahanayake, MP for Galle (and later to become a Prime Minister of Ceylon) who had to be expelled from the party for indiscipline. He broke an express direction of the Central Committee by welcoming and garlanding the UNP Prime Minister, Mr Dudley Senanayake, on the occasion of his visit to Galle.
The Great Hartal

    Soon after it came into power the UNP Government of 1952 found it necessary to impose certain burdens on the masses. The price of sugar was increased and a cut was made in the rice ration. The LSSP was not slow to take up these questions and conduct an agitation among the masses. As a protest against the cut in the rice ration N.M. Perera presented, as a first instalment, a petition with 50,000 signatures collected by the party and youth league organisations.
In 1953 the UNP Government proceeded still further with its economy drive, placing all the burdens of its financial difficulties on the backs of the masses. Rail fares and postal rates were increased, the free mid-day bun given to school children was stopped, and most serious of all, the price of rationed rice was increased at one fell stroke from 25 cents to 70 cents a measure! Mass resentment was all the stronger against this last mentioned action because the masses remembered very well that one of the important propaganda points in the UNP election campaign of the previous year had been the fact that it was supplying rice at 25 cents a measure.
The LSSP took the lead in the agitation against these measures. Meetings were held in all parts of the country, leaflets were distributed, and demonstrations were staged. Mass organisations and institutions like local bodies, feeling the pressure of the masses, began to pass resolutions demanding a reversal of these policies.
When it became clear that the Government was not budging from its position, the LSSP took the lead in inviting the other anti-UNP parties to consider the question of direct action in the situation. At these discussions it was finally decided to call on the masses to observe a one-day hartal as a protest. On that day black flags would be hoisted, children would not go to school, employees would not go to work, shops would be closed, and people would generally desist from their normal pursuits, observing the day as a day of mourning. In the end, of all the political parties that had associated themselves with the agitation, in addition to the LSSP, only the CP-LSSP United Front and the Federal Party remained when it came to a question of action. The SLFP took the position that it was not opposed to the idea of a hartal in principle but was not convinced that the people of Ceylon had come to a stage when they could do such a thing. The Ceylon Indian Congress was prepared only to go as far as the holding of meetings on that day, but not to engage in strike action. Only the LSSP, the United Front and the Federal Party remained to conduct the action. But, with the support of the masses, this proved to be sufficient.
Agitation was stepped up, an appropriate date was decided on and the trade unions and other mass organisations were prepared for action. The date finally decided on, namely, August 12th was not made public too early. The Government took counter-measures in an effort to intimidate the masses. State employees were warned that they would be dismissed if they did not turn up for work, cooperative stores were ordered to keep their doors open, the military were paraded on the streets to frighten the people, the government- owned radio as well as the capitalist press screeched their propaganda in an, effort. to discredit the campaign, and every pressure that could be brought to bear by the state machine and the capitalist class was utilised to make the hartal a failure. One capitalist newspaper actually went so far as to anticipate events by putting out its morning edition with a banner headline announcing “Work Goes on Today”.
The hartal, of course, was an even greater success than had been anticipated. The workers struck, transport was disorganised, and economic life came to a standstill in the towns. In the rural areas, the masses set up road blocks and disorganised telegraphic communications. The strike in the plantation areas was partial on account of the non-participation of the Congress.
The movement reached its height in the coastal areas of the Western and Southern Provinces. Under the leadership of Samasamajists, in Egoda Uyana the masses stopped and literally “captured ”a train, in Waskaduwa one mile of railway line was removed by men, women and children in the night, and in the Southern Province, boulders were rolled onto the roads by the people, which were so large that, after the hartal, the police had to use dynamite to blast them because they were too heavy to move. The hartal, planned for one day only was officially called off by the participating organisations the following morning.
Let this be said to the credit of the masses. Violence they did use, in their wrathful protest against the Government which had cheated them. But this violence was directed, not against persons, but against inanimate objects such as railway lines, buses, telegraph posts and the like, in order to disrupt communications. In contrast to this, the violence of the Government was directed against persons. The police and military fired on the people, killing nine. In Gasworks Street, Colombo, young Edwin, a member of the Pettah Sama Samaja Youth League defied alone an order to disperse, opening his red shirt, baring his breast and inviting the military to shoot. This they did, and Edwin fell, riddled by bullets. He died on the way to hospital.
Thousands were injured as a result or shootings and baton charges, or arrested and detained in jail. An Emergency along with a curfew was declared on the 12th afternoon, which lasted for several weeks. The printing presses of the LSSP and CP were sealed under the Emergency powers. And hundreds of cases were filed against individuals throughout the country.17
But the masses had shown that they were not prepared to take the blows of the capitalist government lying down. In a period when the UNP Government appeared to be all-powerful, the masses had seen the power of their own strength. The Great Hartal marked the turning point in the ebb of the mass movement. It shattered the myth of the invincibility of the UNP and prepared the ground for the defeat of that party in the elections of 1956. Further, the hartal was the first mass political struggle in Ceylon. It revealed the revolutionary strength of the masses and helped to reinforce the self-confidence of revolutionists.
The Lanka Sama Samaja Party will always be justly proud of the role that it played in the hartal. Eschewing sectarianism it sought and obtained the cooperation of all those prepared to join the struggle, and the hartal was called in the name of the Joint Committee of all those organisations. There is no gainsaying, however, that in the action itself, the effective leadership was in the hands of the LSSP. Specially heroic was the role of the thousands of Samasamaja Youth Leaguers who led the militant actions of the masses in town and countryside on August 12th.
The Split of 1953

    After the decisive victory of the UNP in 1952 moods of discouragement began to grow in the party. This was also a time when the victory of the Chinese Revolution had evoked a tremendous admiration throughout South East Asia. In this situation the political ideas of Stalinism commenced once again to gain ground within the party. The first sign of this appeared at the Special Conference of October 1952.18
At this conference a minority resolution sponsored, among others, by T.B. Subasinghe, Henry Peiris and William Silva, declared that in the elections the party should have put forward the slogan of a Democratic Government which would have meant “at its lowest level a Bandaranaike Government ”and “at its highest level a Government by a Sama Samaja majority”. It also took the position that the party should “enter into the closest possible agreement and cooperation with the CP and Philip Group in the trade union and political fields”.
This resolution was defeated at the Conference, which decided that the party should strive for a “united front with the CP, the Philip Gunawardena group and the CP ”not on a comprehesive political programme but “on a programme related to the present needs and consciousness of the masses”. With regard to non-working class parties like the SLFP, the Republican Party and the Federal Party, it was decided that the attempt should be to draw them into united action on specific issues.
In line with the decisions of the Conference the party conducted united front talks with the CP-LSSP United Front in 1953. The talks failed in July of that year because the Lanka Sama Samaja Party was not prepared to give up its right to criticise the Government of the USSR, the Eastern European countries and China, when it considered such criticism was necessary in the interest of the working class movement. In spite of the failure of the negotiations the party decided to work for united action wherever this was possible.
It was clear, however, that the difference in the party was growing, and arrangements were made for the resolution of the question through a party conference after a thorough discussion in the party of two resolutions stating the two points of view. All that happened in this connection demonstrates very well the democratic methods of functioning which have become a tradition of the LSSP.
Articles in support both of the resolution of the leadership and that of the “opposition ”were freely published in the Internal Bulletins which were distributed to the entire membership. Discussions were organised in the party locals, a representative of one side going on one day and of the other side on another day, to explain the two different points of view. And at the Conference itself held in October 1953 equal time was apportioned to the speakers of each side.
The resolution of the Political Bureau on the national situation was passed, receiving 259 votes, while the minority resolution was lost, receiving 125 votes, Thereupon, the supporters of the minority led by William Silva walked out of the Conference, splitting away from the party. In other words, the democratic process had worked so completely that those who had differences of a fundamental nature with the party realised this themselves and left of their own accord.
The party lost a third of its membership in that split, and its enemies gleefully imagined that the Lanka Sama Samaja Party would not recover from the blow. But as in the past, so also on this occasion, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party showed that this was far from the case. To be sure, on account of the split the party was unable to reap the full benefits, politically and organisationally, of its role in the hartal of August 12th, 1953. But within a year the party had made up its losses, demonstrating that the Lanka Sama Samaja Party is not just another party, but fulfils a definite historical need of the mass movement in Ceylon.
In contrast with the rapid revival of the LSSP, what happened to those who split away? They tried to hold together, but they succeeded in doing this only for a short time. It was not long before they scattered. Eventually some of them went into the organisation of Philip Gunawardena, others into the Communist Party, while yet others left politics or steered clear of affiliation to any political party.
1953-1955

    The period from 1953 onwards saw a gradual revival in many fields. In the local government elections of 1954 the party for the first time participated in a large way, and was able to assume the administration in 7 Village Committees, 3 Urban Councils and the Colombo Municipal Council.
Unfortunately, in the local government elections even a No-Contest agreement could not be obtained with CP-LSSP United Front. As far back as June 1952 the LSSP had taken the initiative in trying to get the United Front to fight the then impending Colombo Municipal Council elections on a joint programme with the LSSP. All local government elections were, however, postponed at that time by the UNP Government. However, even in the 1954 elections it was not possible to come to any agreement because of the insistence of the United Front that full political agreement should be arrived at.
One of the results of this attitude was that even when N.M. Perera became Mayor of the Colombo Municipal Council in August 1954, the cooperation of the Municipal Councillors of the CP-LSSP United Front was not forthcoming. On the other hand, the UNP Government pursued a policy of obstruction in relation to the Mayor, and not much positive result could be achieved. After a little over a year, with the crossing over of a CP Municipal Councillor to the side of the UNP, the Mayoralty went to the UNP.
It was in this period commencing from 1954 that the mercantile employees embarked on a series of well organised struggles in which the recalcitrant Employers’ Federation was compelled to negotiate and grant concessions. These struggles reached their high-point in the General Strike of Mercantile employees of March 1956, just prior to the General Elections. These successful actions did much to revive the confidence of the workers and pave the way for stable unions capable of real collective bargaining.
The wresting of the leadership of the Ceylon Mercantile Union away from the labour boss, Mr Goonesinghe, was accomplished after the General Strike of 1947. In this process, as well as the subsequent building of this union into one of the most powerful trade unions in Ceylon, the role of P.B. Tampoe deserves mention.
Since the war, the party had agitated for the establishment of diplomatic and trade relations with the socialist countries, and the China-Ceylon Rice and Rubber Agreement that was concluded in 1952 constituted a victory for this policy. In 1953 the party conducted an agitation for the conducting of this trade entirely through state channels.
In 1954 the party established relations with the Asian Socialist Conference and Colvin R. de Silva attended the meeting of the Bureau of that organisation in Tokyo as a fraternal delegate. However, this connection was destined to be short-lived. When the Asian Socialist Bureau insisted on the party disaffiliating itself from the 4th International as a condition for the continuation of this connection, the party politely but firmly informed that organisation in March 1955 that this was out of the question.
The party contested the Alutnuwara by-election in May 1955. The UNP won the seat. But in spite of the backwardness of the area and the fact that both the SLFP and CP also contested, the party acquitted itself creditably, coming second.19
The CP-LSSP United Front brok up into its two component parts at the beginning of 1955 as a result of internal dissensions. The party signed a united front agreement with the LSSP led by Philip Gunawardena in April 1955, under which the two organisations agreed to cooperate to the maximum extent possible. A joint council was set up hnd a united May Day rally was held. But the agreement was not to last. With the failure, later in the year, to come to an agreement on the allocation of seats for the forthcoming General Election, the agreement died a natural death.
    Chapter 5 – The New Era
The Language Question

    1956 saw the dawn of a new era. This new period was characterised not only by an increased consciousness among the masses with regard to their economic rights, but even more by a cultural renaissance among the Sinhalese. This renaissance took the form principally of an effort to elevate the position of the Sinhala language in the state and society and also of an attempt to revive the customs, traditions and arts of the Sinhalese and to restore Buddhism to the place it had occupied in past history. Unfortunately, however, on the question of the Sinhala language, which was the most important question, the demand took the form of a movement to make Sinhala the sole official language to the exclusion of Tamil, which is spoken by quite considerable minority.
In April 1955 the political resolution adopted at the Party Conference had stated as follows: “The potentiality of this new factor in our politics [the language problem] has not in fact been grasped by our party thus far. We have no doubt seen the swabasha question as a question of national unity, but we have not sufficiently grasped the necessity or the potentialities of advocating it in the form and as a means of the struggle for the completion of our national independence. The party will certainly have to take up the swabasha weapon much more as its own instead of leaving it in wrong and reactionary hands.”
True, even after the Conference the party did not sufficiently grasp the importance of the question and make a determined effort to work according to the spirit of this resolution. But even if it had done so, to put it at its lowest, it is extremely doubtful that the party could have altered the course of subsequent events. For, the movement represented by “Sinhala Only ”became, not only a movement for raising the status of the Sinhala language to the status of an official language, but also a movement against the Tamil minority. This movement was fed not only by historical factors but also by economic competition between the two communities particularly in relation to jobs. The fact that no mass struggle for independence had taken place, fostering a common bond of Ceylonese consciousness in the two communities, made such a development all the easier.
The natural leadership of this movement of cultural renaissance among the Sinhalese went to the SLFP, which in 1955 changed its language, policy from Sinhalese and Tamil as state languages to one of Sinhala as the sole official language. This leadership was further consolidated when, shortly before the General Election of 1956, the SLFP combined with the LSSP of Philip Gunawardena to form the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna.
The Lanka Sama Samaja Party was the only party with a base among the Sinhalese that stood firmly right to the end by its policy of both Sinhala and Tamil as official languages. Even the Communist Party latterly changed its position on this question.
In October 1955 a public meeting held by the party on this question in the Colombo Town Hall was attacked by a hostile crowd with brickbats and bombs, while the police stood by.20 The police finally moved into action only to baton charge and disperse those who were leaving the meeting after it had concluded. Both friend and foe have expressed their admiration of the party’s devotion to principle. But there is no gainsaying that the party has paid a heavy price for its stand. It lost heavily among the Sinhalese masses. And although it has won the sympathy of wide sections of the minorities this has far from compensated for the losses.
The party’s position on the question of citizenship of workers of Indian origin on the plantations has also cost the party a price, but the effect of this has been principally in the up-country areas. However, the party has never ceased its opposition to the unjust citizenship laws, and has adhered to its position that those who are permanent residents who desire to make Ceylon their home should be granted citizenship. (The corollary of this is, of course, that the others should become Indian citizens, so that there is no category of “stateless ”people left.)
As a revolutionary socialist party, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party could not have acted otherwise. For, as distinct from opportunist politicians to whom power is an end in itself, to the LSSP power is only a means to an end. That end is socialism. And it knows that socialism cannot be built except on the basis of the unity and willing cooperation of the masses of all the communities that inhabit Ceylon. And that unity and cooperation can only be achieved by a correct attitude to the problem of the minorities.
The UNP Defeat of 1956

    Realising that the principal task facing the country in the forthcoming elections was the defeat of the United National Party, the party quite early took the initiative in calling for talks with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, and in September 1955 a No-Contest Pact was signed between the LSSP and the SLFP, In accordance with the situation prevailing in the country a majority of seats was assigned to the SLFP.
Shortly before the elections the SLFP formed a front with certain other organisations like the LSSP of Philip Gunawardena, the Basha Perumana, and even individuals, called the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP), for the purpose of the elections, After this, the No-Contest Pact with the LSSP was partially broken by MEP candidates not belonging to the SLFP contesting the LS5P in several seats assigned to the party. The party, however, conscious that the task was to defeat the UNP, did not aggravate the situation by any attempt at reprisals.
The election campaign became a veritable mass struggle against the hated capitalist UNP. UNP leaders going to election meetings were greeted with black flags and buns strung up in a row (to illustrate the withdrawal of the free mid-day bun given to school children). And, to add to the anti-capitalist sentiments of the masses, in the Sinhalese areas there was the new factor represented by the language question. The UNP, at a party conference held immediately prior to the election, had itself changed its language policy to one of Sinhala only. But this action was only greeted by the masses with derision. They were firmly convinced that what the UNP really stood for was English only!
The elections resulted in a rout of the UNP. The principal significance of the election result lay in the fact that for the first time the masses had broken away from the leadership of the big bourgeoisie. The UNP which had put forward 76 candidates won only 8 seats, securing a total of 738,551 votes. The MEP which had put forward 60 candidates won 51 seats, with 1,046,362 votes. The LSSP which had put forward 21 candidates, won 14 seats, polling 274,204 votes. The Federal Party, with 14 candidates won 10 seats, polling 142,036 votes. And the Communist Party, with 9 candidates polled 119,715 votes, winning 3 seats.
The LSSP took its seats in the Opposition and, as the single largest party in the Opposition, the Leadership of the Opposition fell to it. However, at the commencement, the LSSP defined its attitude to the new MEP Government as one of “responsive cooperation”. This attitude however changed to one of opposition very soon, when the Government introduced its “Sinhala Only ”Bill. This was the occasion for minor riots. But in 1958, when a pact which the Prime Minister, Mr Bandaranaike, had concluded with the Federal Party broke down, there were widespread riots and killings, followed by a period of Emergency which lasted several months. For a number of months political life was at a virtual standstill.
In its three and a half years of office the MEP did have certain achievements to its credit. It nationalised bus transport and the Colombo Port. It introduced the Paddy Lands Act and the Multi-Purpose Co-operatives. It started the National Provident Fund. To all practical interests and purposes it took over the naval and air bases from the British. It established diplomatic relations with the Socialist countries. It gradually reinstated the Government employees dismissed after the General Strike of 1947. And it reversed the anti-trade union policy of the UNP Government. The LSSP solidarised itself with these progressive acts.
However, there was plenty on the debit side as well. The nationalisations were not the success that was expected because the Government was not prepared, in spite of the repeated insistence of the LSSP, to give the workers a share in the management of nationalised concerns, preferring to run them on bureaucratic lines, with the same old capitalist managerial methods. The reforms in agriculture could not be properly implemented and the new co-operatives could not forge ahead because of the absence of planning and co-ordination and because of opposition within the Government itself to these measures.
Workers’ problems were not faced up to and tackled, but constantly postponed, leading to widespread strikes. An anti-democratic Public Security Amendment Act was passed giving extraordinary powers to the Prime Minister. And no attempt was made to introduce even the beginnings of a planned economic development. In 1959 the Prime Minister announced that it was not proposed to take up the question of the nationalisation of the plantations for another 10 years. Finally, Sinhalese communalism and Tamil communalism, which were roused to a high pitch by the policies of the Government itself and by the public declarations of many of its leaders, resulted in widespread rioting and Emergency rule, which threatened the unity of the country and brought the normal administration practically to a standstill. Even to think of economic development in such conditions was not possible. Such is the irony of history. The very question which more than any other had helped to bring the MEP Government to power proved to be the biggest obstacle in the way of the progress of that Government.
The Trade Union Upsurge

    The victory of the MEP in April 1956 was greeted with joy by all sections of the masses. But no section was happier than the workers. Having suffered under the anti-union policies of the combined forces of the employees and the Government, the workers welcomed the advent of the MEP Government as ushering in a new era for the workers.
The new Government itself declared that its policy was to encourage the growth of trade unionism. Whether this policy was effectively translated into action is a different matter. Shootings and killings of striking workers demonstrated that the police at least were following a different policy. But the workers took the Government at its word, and the period from 1956 onwards saw an unprecedented development of trade unionism in Ceylon.
At first the workers did not wish to embarrass the new government by strikes. Although their wage demands were acute in a situation where the cost of living was rapidly rising, they waited patiently for over a year in the hope that the Government would take measures that would grant them relief.21 The Government, however, postponed all these questions.
Finally, driven to desperation, the Government workers, organised in the LSSP-led Government Workers’ Trade Union Federation, launched a two-day strike in November 1957. It was a General Strike of railway workers and spread into other sections of government workers too. A number of demands were won, including a Rs. 17-50 Special Allowance and the securing of permanency or temporary monthly paid status for thousands of casual workers.
The widespread floods of December 1957 brought the strike wave to a temporary halt, but at the end of February a large number of workers in engineering firms, hotels, shops and certain other establishments in the private sector, belonging to the unions affiliated to the CSSP-led Ceylon Federation of Labour, went on strike. The principal demand was the Rs. 17-50 Special Allowance. In April of that year a big strike was called by the LSSP-led Ceylon Trade Union Federation. The majority of strikers were those engaged in the tea and rubber packing trades in Colombo. A strike of the Government clerical employees was also called at the same time. While the police attacked the striking clerks the armed forces paraded the streets in an effort to intimidate the strikers. It was only after a vehement protest by the Ceylon Federation of Labour that the armed forces were taken off the streets.
The wave of workers’ struggles came to an end only in the latter half of May with the sudden outbreak of communal rioting and the declaration of a State of Emergency. But in a few months, even before the Emergency was lifted, isolated workers’ strikes were taking place. And the middle of 1959 saw further economic struggles, some of them big strikes like the strike in the harbour, conducted by the LSSP-led United Port Workers Union and the strike of the mercantile employees called by the Ceylon Mercantile Union.
As distinct from economic struggles a one-day political strike that took place on March 3rd 1959 deserves special mention. An amendment was introduced in Parliament to the Public Security Act, giving extraordinary new powers to the police and armed forces if the Prime Minister is of opinion that the public security is endangered or such danger is imminent. The LSSP-led Ceylon Federation of Labour took the initiative in convening a meeting of representatives of all the trade union centres and principal trade unions. This conference, composed of the Ceylon Federation of Labour, the Government Workers’ Trade Union Federation, the Ceylon Workers’ Congress, the Democratic Workers’ Congress, the Ceylon Mercantile Union and a number of other unions, finally decided on a one-day protest strike on March 3rd. There was no question of course of the unions led by the SLFP or Philip Gunawardena group participating in an action against the Government, while the CP-led Ceylon Trade Union Federation, although it was against the Bill, was not prepared for action on this issue.
When this anti-democratic piece of legislation came before Parliament, the party Members of Parliament, in order to demonstrate the extent of their opposition and to alert the country to the dangers inherent in the Bill, adopted obstructionist tactics and had to be forcibly removed from the chamber of the House of Representatives on February 12th with the aid of the police.
As was to be expected, the Government, the Press, the Radio, as well as the unions led by the Communist Party, the SLFP and the Philip Gunawardena group did everything they could to sabotage the strike. The March 3rd action as a strike was only a partial success. But it fully succeeded in its purpose, which was to register a working class protest in an emphatic manner against a reactionary and anti-democratic piece of legislation.
The period commencing with the formation of the MEP Government in 1956 was one in which, generally speaking, the influence of the party among the masses declined. The principal factor contributing to this result was the language question of which mention was made earlier. In the local government elections at the end of 1956 the party suffered reverses outside Colombo, while in Colombo the party suffered a defeat that was in the nature of a rout. Its group in the Colombo Municipal Council was reduced to 3, while 3 sitting members lost their seats to MEP candidates.
It is worth recording that in the national disaster caused by the floods at the end of 1959, the Sama Samaja Youth Leagues lost no time in despatching numbers of volunteers to some of the worst affected areas for relief work. Several relief camps were opened, especially in the North Central Province, and the youth leaguers played a role reminiscent of the role played by the Suriya Mal workers in the malaria epidemic twenty five years earlier.
It is also worth mentioning that in this period the party sent two delegations to visit and study conditions in China and Yugoslavia. The party delegation to China, numbering five, visited China in 1957, and a delegation of two visited Yugoslavia in 1959. These visits enabled the party to obtain far better knowledge of the concrete and varying problems facing these countries in their march forward to socialism of the methods they were employing to solve them. But this was not all. On the one hand the visits constituted a demonstration by a Trotskyist party of its solidarity with workers’ states and their valiant efforts on the road to socialism. On the other hand, in these countries the visits may have done something to help to dispel the false notion that Trotskyists are incapable of building mass parties.
In May 1959, Philip Gunawardena, Minister of Agriculture and William Silva, Minister of Industries, resigned from the Government as a protest against the decision of the Prime Minister to remove from their charge important departments of which they had up to then been in control. This was a sequel to strained relations that had been developing between them and the right wing in the Cabinet. A small group splitting away with them did not affect the Government majority in the House of Representatives. However, important and unforeseen events were soon to take place to bring about the downfall of the Government.
The Present Period

    On September 25th, 1959, an assassin shot the Prime Minister, Mr S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. The following day he succumbed to his injuries and the Leader of the House at the time, Mr W. Dahanayake, was sworn in as Prime Minister. The first reaction of the entire nation to the tragedy was one of shock. But as time went on, public dissatisfaction began to grow with regard to the manner of investigation into the circumstances of the tragedy. Within Parliament and outside, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party took the lead in bringing many matters to light, in criticising official apathy and in demanding a full inquiry into the political conspiracy behind the assassination.
The Dahanayake Government was not destined to last long. After a few weeks the new Prime Minister unceremoniously dismissed his SLFP Ministers, formed a new party with some of the Right Wing SLFPers and not having a majority in Parliament, dissolved Parliament and arranged for a General Election.
Like the General Election of 1952, that of March 1960 was one in which each political party made its own independent bid. Unable to come to programmatic agreement with either the Communist Party or the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (which name was taken over by the organisation of Philip Gunawardena) the LSSP made its own independent bid for power, fighting 100 seats (out of a total of 151) on an anti-capitalist programme.
The results were as follows. The UNP, putting forward 127 candidates won 50 seats, polling a total of 901,082 votes. The SLFP, with 108 candidates won 46 seats, polling 654,767 votes. The LSSP, with 100 candidates won 10 seats, polling 325,250 votes. And the MEP, with 89 candidates, won 10 seats polling 322,794 votes. True, this was the highest number of votes polled so far at a General Election by the party. Even in the General Election of 1947 the combined votes of the Trotskyist parties had amounted only 317,213. But there was no getting away from the fact that the election result was a defeat It was also clear that the wave of Sinhalese communalism represented by the cry of “Sinhala Only”, though not as powerful as in 1956, was still an important factor and prevented large numbers of anti-capitalist minded people who would otherwise have voted for the LSSP from voting for the LSSP, which took the position of making Tamil also an official language. The Indian question was also a question which adversely affected the party in upcountry areas.
Very soon after the election results were known, Mr Dudley Senanayake, the leader of the United National Party, the largest single party, was called upon by the Governor General to form a Government. While the formation of the UNP Government was greeted with jubilation by the propertied and privileged strata of society, Ceylonese and foreign alike, to the toiling masses the day of the return to power of the hated UNP was like a day of mourning. The only ray of hope was that the UNP was still a minority government not commanding a majority in Parliament. In this situation the LSSP bent all its efforts to secure the downfall of the UNP Government as early as possible, doing everything it could to stiffen the ranks of the Opposition in the face of blandishments from the side of the UNP till the date when the vote on a motion of Confidence would be taken. The UNP Government was defeated on the vote on the Address of Thanks to the Throne Speech.22 The Governor General instead of calling upon the SLFP Leader of the Opposition to form a Government, gave in to the request of the UNP Premier to dissolve Parliament and hold a fresh election.
Once again the LSSP, realising the needs of the situation, entered into a No-Contest and mutual support pact with the SLFP and the CP, and as in 1956 laid the basis firmly and truly for the defeat of the UNP in the General Election of July 1960. The results of the March election had shown that the masses by and large had chosen the SUP as their main weapon to defeat the UNP. The results also demonstrated that very large sections of the masses, especially in rural areas, considered the SLFP too to be a leftist party capable of radical anti-capitalist measures. For them, this had to be tested out in experience. Accordingly, under the electoral agreement, while the SLFP contested 98 seats, the LSSP contested only 21, thus paying the way for the formation of a SLFP Government after the defeat of the UNP. However, the programme of demands put forward by the party in this election campaign was identical with what it had put forward in the March election when it had fought under the slogan of a Samasamaja Government.
In spite of the complete unity of the propertied classes and their utmost efforts, aided by the state machinery which was under the control of the UNP, the UNP was defeated in the July General Election. Although its 128 candidates polled 1,145,607 votes it won only 30 seats. The SLFP won 75 seats, polling 1,011,661 votes. The LSSP won 12 seats polling 214,693 votes. A SLFP Government was formed immediately afterwards with Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike as Prime Minister.
The Lanka Sama Samaja Party, while functioning as an independent group bound neither to the Government Party nor the Opposition Party, today adopts a position of general support of the Government, holding itself free to criticise the Government as well as vote against it where it disagrees. This support it will continue to give so long as the Government, in line with its socialist professions, subserves the needs of the mass movement for socialism.
This is a short, indeed a very short, history of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party during the first twenty five years of its existence. Twenty five years is a short period in history. But it is long enough a period for one to discover the programme, the character, the physiognomy and the traditions of a party. The attentive reader would have discovered many such features which have become a part of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. In particular he could not have failed to note its irreconcilable opposition to imperialism and capitalism, its passionate defence of democratic rights and its sincere regard for democratic processes, its socialist internationalism as well as its deep desire for a real national unity forged on the mutual trust of the different communities who inhabit our country, and last but not least its revolutionary faith in the capacity of the masses to achieve.
The history of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party shows that its path has not been a smooth one. There have been times when its enemies predicted that it would not rise again. But they were proved to be wrong. On the other hand, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party has also had its victories. Its history contains its chapters of glory. But inspiring through those episodes may be, the most glorious chapters have yet to be written.

Notes
1. Terence N. de Silva died in 1959.
2. B.J. Fernando was the composer of the international song of the party.
3. To give but one example the word “pakshaya”, meaning “party”, used to be used loosely and incorrectly in the thirties to describe the words “class”. It is the Samasamaja movement that popularised the correct word “panthiya ”in this connection.
4. V. Sittampalam died in 1945.
5. Reggie Senanayake died in 1946.
6. Henry Peiris died in 1959.
7. V. Balasingham died in 1944.
8. Rathu Wijesinghe died in 1958.
9. David Perera died in 1944.
10. The Communist Party in this period characterised the UNP as a front rather than a party. While admitting that it had a reactionary leadership it nevertheless stressed that there were progressives in its ranks. This led it to decide on a policy that was in fact pro-UNP and anti-LSSP for the forthcoming election of 1947.
11. This group was under the influence of the ideas of M.N. Roy of India.
12. C. Tharmakulasingham died in 1949.
13. This warning was specially important at the time because the Communist Party, acting in the interests of contemporary Soviet foreign policy, was engaged in adventurist actions.
14. The Communist Party put forward a candidate against N.M. Perera at Ruanwella, for example, but later withdrew their nomination. This candidate finally contested as an Independent.
15. The LSSP took the position that although legally power had been transferred, independence was a fake one on account of the economic domination of Ceylon’s economy by the imperialists, the continuation by Britain of military bases in Ceylon, and the existence of a secret defence agreement, explicit or implied, with the British Government. This position has undergone modification over the years, with the virtual evacuation of the bases under the MEP Government of 1956-59 and the absence of evidence of a secret defence agreement.
16. Programmatic agreement was not possible, because the United Front’s aim in the elections was the creation of a “democratic government”. In the elections the CP-LSSP United Front supported SLFP candidates against candidates of the LSSP.
17. The Lanka Sama Samaja Party, conscious of its responsibilities, saw to it that a free defence was supplied by the party in these cases. Happily, it was possible to secure acquittals in mast cases.
18. It has always been the practice of the LSSP, as a democratic party, to hold conferences regularly and also whenever the situation demands it. After the unification Conference of 1950, there were party Conferences in February 1951, December 1951, October 1952, October 1953, April 1955, February 1957, July 1959, April 1960 and May 1960, making a total of 10 Conferences in the past 10 years.
19. The voting was as follows: UNP – 5,291, L55P – 2,177, SLFP – 964, CP – 504.
20. Reggie Mendis lost his left hand through the bursting of a bomb.
21. The only major strikes in this early period were the strikes of the dock workers. And even these strikes were sparked off in September 1956 by the Harbour and Dock Workers Union, controlled by Philip Gunawardena, a Minister in the MEP Government.
22. The MEP remained neutral in the decisive vote, in keeping with the line that it put forward of a National Government, which could only have meant a Government under the leadership of the UNP.

Leslie Goonewardene
Rise And Fall Of The Comintern
 The Comintern And The Imperialist War
Chapter Nine
The first organisational attempt of the Communist Party of Great Britain to introduce the Popular Front in Great Britain was the “Unity Campaign” of the Communist Party, the Socialist League and the Independent Labour Party, commenced at the end of 1936 with the ostensible aim of bringing about unity with the Labour Party and of pushing that organisation left. But the Labour Party leaders were able easily to disrupt the campaign which fizzled out after a few months. This was possible principally because the campaign was not one for raising support for a series of class demands as a basis of struggle but a thinly veiled manoeuvre of the Communists for obtaining support for an Anglo-Soviet Pact. In 1937 the Popular Front idea was openly extended by the Communists to the international plane. The British workers were told that not only Mosley but Hitler was their enemy. The agitation for a “Peace Alliance” of the Soviet Union with the democratic imperialisms against Germany commenced. The Communists declared their preparedness to take in Liberals into their “anti-Fascists front”. After the Munich Pact of September 1938 the main agitation of the C.P. of Great Britain was centered round the demand for the “Peace Alliance” against Hitler. Their opposition now was only to the “Pro-Nazi” Chamberlain, and they even declared their willingness to support a government led by Churchill.
It was perhaps the Communist Party of the U.S.A., however, that outdid all other sections of the Comintern in the manner it grovelled before its own bourgeoisie in the attempt to win them over to a pact with the Soviet Union. It became the most jingoist of jingos and the staunch defender of the American Constitution. Earl Browder, leader of the American Communist Party, declared “America has seen the Communist Party as the most consistent fighter for democracy, for the enforcement of the democratic provisions of our Constitution, for the defence of our flag, and the revival of its glorious revolutionary tradition. America has seen that Communism is twentieth-century Americanism”. (Daily Worker , New York, Nov. 3, 1936). But not satisfied with promising all support to American imperialism if it sided with the Soviet Union against Germany, the shameless Browder publicly declared before the senatorial investigating committee that in the event of a war between the U.S.A. and the Soviet Union, he and his party would be on the side of their own democratic fatherland! Such is the mental baseness induced by the foul disease of Stalinism.
FROM IMPERIALIST WAR TO PEOPLE’S WAR
Suddenly, and without any warning to the Popular Fronters, Stalin made a volte face  in his foreign policy, and signed a pact with Hitler on August 20, 1939. On September 3rd began the war against Hitler, but without the Soviet Union. The Russo-German Non-Aggression Pact came as a bolt from the blue to Stalin’s agents abroad. They failed to realise what it meant. The Stalinist bureaucrats in Britain and France, their intellects dulled through a long period of slavishly carrying out orders, were unable to see what was required of them. For a month, the Communist Parties of Britain and France still following the line of popular front days, supported the war as one of democracy against fascism. Perhaps Stalin fuming in the Kremlin at their dull-wittedness, remembered even now Lenin’s warning in 1921 to Bukarin and Zinoviev that if they demanded nothing but approbation in the International they would surround themselves exclusively with “obedient fools”! The leader of the British C.P., Harry Pollitt, in his enthusiasm even published a booklet entitled “How to Win the War,” a feat which, in the Soviet Union, would have qualified him for a G.P.U. prison.
However, before long the obedient, if foolish agents of Stalin in Britain and France were acquainted of the error of their ways and forthwith changed the party line. The war against fascism transformed itself without difficulty into an imperialist war in the interests of Soviet foreign policy. The responsibility for the war was placed that on Britain and France, and the demand was put forward that peace be made with Hitler on the basis of the Russo-German terms. And thus the Comintern demonstrated in open and unashamed fashion that it was nothing but an instrument in the hands of the Soviet bureaucrats to be used for the purposes of their foreign policy. And in the meantime, it had done the war propaganda of the Anglo-French imperialists much more effectively than those gentlemen could ever have done it themselves, and thus helped the imperialists to drag the workers of Britain and. France into the war.
The Russo-German Pact was not merely one of non-aggression, but one in which Stalin promised to supply Hitler with raw materials needed by Germany. The Soviet attitude towards Germany at war was one of benevolent neutrality, if not active sympathy. The Comintern policy in Germany accordingly underwent a change. At the 7th Congress Dimitrov had called fascism the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of finance capital, and German Fascism the most reactionary variety of Fascism. Now British finance capital became the most reactionary in the world. Walter Ulbricht, since 1935 the leader of the General Executive Committee of C.P. of Germany, writing in the official German Communists paper Die Welt , stated “The German Government declares itself willing to take up friendly relations with the Soviet Union, whereas the Anglo-French militarist bloc desire a war against the Socialist Soviet Union. The Soviet people and the German working class have therefore an interest in checking the war plans of the British ... This war policy is all the more criminal since the Power which âaccording to Hilferding’ is to determine the future fate of Germany at the outcome of the war is the most reactionary Power in the world . British Imperialism displays its completely reactionary nature anew by turning down the proposal for a termination of the war which—Germany has made with the support of the Soviet Union”.
Ulbricht goes on, “The workers of Germany are fighting heroically against the oppression and exploitation of the working class by the present regime in Germany because such terroristic rule injures the German people and discredits Germany in. the eyes of the world, and because it thereby weakens the resistance of the German people, and enables reactionary forces in England and France to use chauvinist arguments to mask their true war aims.” That is to say, the German Communist “opposed” the Hitler regime in the period of the Russo-German Pact is much the same way that the Indian Communists “opposed” imperialist repression in 1942—because “such terroristic rule” “weakens the resistance” of the Indian people to the Japanese in the war against Japan. In other words, in this period of Soviet-German Collaboration, the C.P. of Germany tacitly supported their own bourgeoisie in the imperialist war. The arch enemy of the Communists was no longer the Hitler regime but the opponents of the Russo-German Pact.
No one was surprised when, after the treacherous German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Communist Parties in the democratic countries came out for unconditional support of the war. With the entry of the Soviet Union into the war, it became transformed overnight into a “People’s War” against Fascism, deserving the support of the proletariat of all countries. Revolutionists opposing the war as imperialist were branded as “fifth columnists” and agents of Tokyo or Berlin. The agents of the counter revolutionary Comintern, after a short lapse, again became the staunchest defenders of bourgeois democracy. They used the sympathy of the masses for the Soviet Union in order to win support for the democratic imperialisms. It little mattered to these cynical betrayers that in October 1917 the Russian workers made their proletarian revolution by overthrowing the “democratic” government of Kerensky, which together with the democracies of England, France and America were then fighting another “war for democracy” against the autocratic monarchy of the German Kaiser. In the words of Trotsky, “The memory of the first victorious uprising of the proletariat against bourgeois democracy serves in the hands of the usurpers to save bourgeois democracy from the proletarian uprising.” (New International , October, 1938).
THE DISSOLUTION OF THE COMINTERN
In June 1942 Stalin signed the Anglo-Russian treaty whereby the Soviet Union pledged “non-interference in the internal affairs of other states.” But the high water mark of collaboration between the Soviet Union and its Anglo-American allies was reached in May 1943 with the announcement by the Presidium of the Comintern of its resolution to dissolve the Comintern. The Comintern was bureaucratically wound up a month later.
As usual the resolution attempted to cover up the real reasons for dissolution with specious references to “increasing complications in the internal as well as international relations of the various countries.” The first article of the Statutes of the Communist International, adopted at its Second World Congress in 1920, had stated: “The New International Association of Workers is founded for the purpose of organising a joint action of the proletariat of different countries, aiming at a single and identical goal, viz., the overthrow of capitalism, the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat and of an international republic of soviets which will make it possible completely to abolish classes and bring about socialism, the first stage of communist society.” The Third International had been founded precisely because the international revolution demanded an international strategy and an international General Staff. Setting itself against this principle, the Stalinist resolution of dissolution declared that “any sort of international. centre was bound to encounter insuperable obstacles in attempting a solution of the problems facing the working class movement in each particular country” because of “deep differences in the historic paths of development in various countries of the world, differences of character and even of contradictions in their social orders, differences in the level and tempo of the economic and political development, and finally differences in the degree of consciousness of their workers.” These differences existed also in 1919. Therefore, if we are to accept the arguments of the Presidium resolution, the Comintern should never have been founded!
The truth, however, is quite otherwise. Never have the workers of the world needed an International more than they do today. “The world is not only ripe but over-ripe for the transition to socialism. All the objective conditions indicated by Marx and Lenin exist for the socialist revolution; the only thing that has been lacking is precisely the International which Stalin asserts the workers do not need.”
Not all the arguments that Stalin’s hired professors could muster can hide the fact that the dissolution of the Comintern was a concession to the Anglo-American imperialists. True, it had ceased to be a revolutionary instrument long ago. But in the eyes of the imperialists the Comintern still represented a threat to capitalism. For the Comintern remained an organisation which—even though nominally—still embodied in its programme the objective “to organise under the banner of the proletarian dictatorship the revolution against imperialism in the so-called civilised states” and “to support every movement against imperialist violence in the colonies, semi-colonies and dependencies.” It is not unnatural that Anglo-American imperialism should see the desirability of “releasing the various sections from obligations ensuing from the constitution and decisions of the Comintern Congress.”
The dissolution of the Comintern marked the final and logical culmination of that process of degeneration which had commenced with the acceptance of the theory of socialism in a single country and against which Trotsky and the Left Opposition had warned and fought nearly twenty years earlier.

 Goonewardene: Rise And Fall Of The Comintern: Chapter 6    Leslie Goonewardene Rise And Fall Of The Comintern  The Five Year Plan  Chapter Six Owing to the fog which the Comintern has shed over the controversies of the years 1923-27, and the one-sided flood of publicity bestowed on the truly great achievements of construction in the Soviet Union, it is popularly but wrongly believed that Stalin and his faction were the originators of the ideas of planning and industrialisation. The truth is, however, quite otherwise. The idea of industrialisation with a long term plan was one of the main planks in the agitation of the Left Opposition since 1923, and was vehemently opposed by the bureaucrats. It was only in 1926 that the bureaucracy were forced by economic and social forces more powerful than themselves to put into effect the main proposals of the Opposition which had been expelled only a few months before, but of course, with all the mistakes inherent in bureaucratic inefficiency mid theoretical bankruptcy. THE STALINIST OPPOSITION TO INDUSTRIALISATION PLAN As early as April 1923 Trotsky laid before the 4th Congress of the Party his theses for the elaboration of a single economic plan to industrialise the country and to pave the way for the collectivisation of agriculture. He pointed out that the greatest weakness in Russian economy was the preponderance of a backward and individualist agriculture. This weakness could progressively be decreased only to the extent that it was possible to develop industry and especially heavy industry. For this a State plan of industry was necessary. Industrialisation was absolutely necessary for the maintenance of the dictatorship of the proletariat. “Trotskyism” being at that time not yet discovered, the theses were passed unanimously. But nothing was done and after the death of Lenin they were openly opposed by Stalin and the bureaucrats in power. But from 1923 onwards, the Left Opposition continued to point out that Russia’s backwardness made speedy industrialisation imperative especially in view of the retardation of the international revolution. In addition, among the peasantry, the rich peasant (kulak) was growing stronger and constituting a real danger. This could be countered only by the systematic organisation of the poor peasants in the collectives. A comprehensive plan of industrial progress that could reorganise agriculture, supply cheap goods to the peasantry and provide the basis for the abolition of the petty bourgeois strata of the village population was imperative. In 1925, in his book “Whither Russia” Trotsky made a detailed analysis of the tremendous possibilities for progress which the concentration of power in the hands of the proletarian dictatorship offered, even on the basis of an isolated workers’ state; He pointed out that on the basis of Socialist accumulation the Soviet republic could show a speed of industrial progress unknown to capitalism. Such a rate of progress was possible on account of firstly, the practical absence of parasitic social classes;[1] secondly the abolition of the principle of private property, placing all productive forces at the disposal of the state; thirdly the technical improvements made possible by a State plan; and fourthly, the ability by means of a plan to reduce the effect of crises. “These four advantages”, he wrote, “correctly utilised, will provide us with the opportunity, in the coming years of increasing the rate of our industrial expansion not merely to double the pre-war 6 per-cent but to three times that figure and perhaps even more”. (Trotsky—Whither Russia ). But Trotsky’s ideas were ridiculed by the bureaucracy. This did not however prevent them from levelling against Trotsky at the same time, the two contradictory charges, that he was opposed to the building of Socialism in Russia and that his proposals for industrialisation were too extreme. Devoid of incentive and persisting in their philistine ignorance, the bureaucracy opposed the idea of planning. Leaning more and more on the growing class of kulaks, they opposed industrialisation, but the kulak class, was growing in strength in the countryside as well as permeating a section of the party with its ideology. The kulak danger, which the Opposition had warned against was to be demonstrated in a spectacular manner before long. THE PLATFORM OF THE OPPOSITION At last, in 1926, a 5-year plan drawn up by Rykov and adopted by the party leaders, was produced. This meagre plan proposed a rate of increase of 9 per cent for the first year and a decreasing percentage each year till a 4 per cent increase was to be reached at the end of the period. The 1927 Platform of the Opposition categorically rejected this worthless plan which did not recognise the tremendous possibilities of advance inherent in the gains of October revolution. It pointed out that the means for a greater rate of growth could be found by a forced loan from the kulaks, a cutting down of overhead charges and expenses of the bureaucratic apparatus, and by a correct utilisation of the foreign trade monopoly. “To bring forward on the anniversary of the October revolution such a parsimonious, through and through pessimistic plan really means that you are working against Socialism” stated the Platform. The Platform embodied an elaborate series of proposals to the party, including a warning against the kulak danger and the necessity of a resolute curbing of his ability to exploit, an exposure of the theory of Socialism in one country, how this theory prevented a full utilisation of the benefits of world trade in the period of peace, a demand for adequate preparations for the defence of the Soviet Union, a, call for the re-introduction of internal democracy in the party and its regeneration, and finally stating that it stood for the unity of the party. We have recounted what earlier was the fate of the Platform and of the Oppositionists who put it forward.[2] In January 1928, one month after the 15th Congress that had ratified the expulsion of the Oppositionists, a rising of the kulaks occurred. Emboldened by the expulsion of the Oppositionists, the kulaks refused to deliver their stocks of grain, demanding higher prices than those fixed by the State. They threatened to keep their stocks and starve the cities into submission if their demands were not met with. So effective was their opposition, that armed force had to be employed to requisition grain. Thus in dramatic fashion the correctness of the warning of the Opposition with regard to the kulak danger was demonstrated. It was clear that NEP would no longer work and that the Opposition criticisms had been correct. Faced now with the danger of being crushed by the kulak and urban petty-bourgeois strata, the bureaucracy was compelled to make an about-face turn. Stalin was compelled to alter his First Five Year Plan, to embark on a bolder and more far-reaching plan, and to initiate a drive against the kulak. Stalin now saw the necessity of breaking with his Rightist friends. At first cutting the ground under their feet by attacking their supporters, in 1929, he embarked on a frontal attack on the real leaders, Rykov, Bukharin and Tomsky. Before a confounded public the three leaders of the Right were accused of attempting to introduce capitalism into Russia. The President of the Comintern, the head of the Soviet Government, and the leader of the Soviet Trade Unions were now denounced and disgraced as the agents of the counter-revolution. In Siberia, some of the Left Oppositionist exiles, hearing that Stalin had adopted the main proposals of the Opposition Platform on industrialisation, capitulated, confessed their sins, abjured Trotsky and came back. The more resolute of them who refused to abandon their principles, if they have not died, they are in exile to this day. Trotsky himself, who had been exiled to Alma Ata, was deported in February 1929 from Russia and found asylum in Turkey. THE FIVE YEAR PLAN THAT CAME SIX YEARS LATE The amended Five Year Plan, put into practice six years after it had been proposed by Trotsky and the Opposition, saved the Soviet Union from collapse. A plan for a large increase of industry (particularly heavy industry) and of collectivisation of one fifth of the peasant holdings was proposed. In the first year of the operation of the plan the successes and the rate of expansion surprised the bureaucrats themselves. In 1925 when Trotsky stated that a rate of growth of 18 per cent. or even more was possible he had been derided. Now, stated Stalin, the reactionary character of Trotsky’s 18 per cent. was proved by the figures of 1929-30 which he claimed were 32 per cent. The bureaucracy which had been mistrustful of industrialisation, now went to the other extreme. The successes that they had never anticipated went to their heads. The world economic crisis which commenced at the end of 1929 meant a catastrophic fall in the prices of raw materials. And it was by the export mainly of these that Russia hoped to pay for her imports of machinery from abroad. Consequently the world economic crisis was a blow to the smooth prosecution of the Five Year Plan. But Stalin now set out to accomplish the Five Year Plan in four years. The theory of Socialism in one country had hitherto been an instrument against Trotsky’s theory of permanent revolution. Now the Stalinists actually began to believe that this was achievable through the Plan. Trotsky and the Opposition, while foretelling the tremendous advantages of construction in a workers’ state as compared with what was possible under capitalism, had never exaggerated the possibilities. They had never claimed anything more than that by planned industrialisation the position of the working class in the Soviet Union could be strengthened and that the workers’ state could be much more stronger. But the bureaucracy now claimed that at the end of the Second Five Year Plan a Socialist system would be created surpassing the capitalism of Britain, America and Germany! Trotsky from his exile now warned against the exaggerated tempo and expectations. Stalin replied accusing Trotsky of Rightism, and set 47 per cent. as the rate of increase for the next year! This placed a tremendous burden on the backs of the working class. The resistance of the workers was met by terror. Workers were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for indiscipline, and every instrument of repression was utilised to keep up the inhuman tempo. THE PEASANTRY AND COLLECTIVISATION Marx and Engels had even in their time pointed out that the drawing of the peasants into the socialist economy should be done by stages, commencing with co-operative farms, and that the method utilised should be persuasion and not compulsion. This too had always been the attitude of Lenin to the peasantry. The Opposition had pointed out that the rate at which collectivisation could proceed depended upon the growth of industry. For, large scale collective farming could be more economic than peasant cultivation only if industry was able to supply the requisite quantity of technical equipment. Whatever may be the rapidity of growth of Russian industry under planning, it was absurd to imagine that Russia unaided by the more advanced countries would be able for a long time to supply the technical means to collectivise more than a fraction of her predominantly peasant population. But what did the Stalinist bureaucracy do? The kulaks were deported to Siberia or other regions and the peasants forced into not co-operative farms, but communes[3]. In little over a year over fifteen million peasants had been organised in collectives. Stalin however was soon forced to call a temporary halt and to abandon his policy of drawing the peasant straight into the commune, and to organise them instead in the âartel’ form of collective where only land and cattle are collectivised. The forcible collectivisation of peasants, however, was recommenced. The original proposal to collectivise 20 per cent. of the peasantry by the end of the plan was surpassed in two years. The whole Soviet Press triumphantly announced that the peasants had turned to Socialism and that the classless society was approaching. And so Stalin set out to accomplish by administrative decree what Russian industry was incapable of achieving. By the end of 1931 over 60 per cent. of the farms had been collectivised. What was the result of this mad policy? The peasants refused to produce; they slaughtered their cattle rather than take it to the collectives. There were mass shootings and deportations of peasants. Agricultural production slumped catastrophically. In 1932 a widespread famine set in. In the end the Stalinists were forced to permit the peasant to carry on his private trade. For the past so many years it has been announced to the world by the Stalinist press that the collectivisation of the peasants is complete and the classless society established. But nevertheless Stalin and Molotov found it necessary to issue a decree in 1939 threatening the peasants with dire punishment unless they worked 80 to 100 days a year on the collective farms. What does this mean if not that the peasants find it more profitable to work on their own plots rather than to work on the collective? The forced collectivisation of the peasantry has by no means disproved the forecast of the Opposition based on the scientific theory of Marxism. It has only proved more forcibly the inability of one country to attain Socialism in isolation from world economy and confirmed the dependence of the Soviet State on international revolution. ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY The enormous advances made under the five year plans are a living testimony to the superiority of socialist methods of production over capitalist. But it is important to realise that these advances were made not because of the bureaucracy but in spite of it. The successes were made possible by the chief gains of the October revolution: nationalisation of the means of production and monopoly of foreign trade. The part played by the bureaucracy the obstinate scepticism they displayed for six years and then the dizzy excesses that led not only to imposing untold burdens on the workers and peasants but also to a disastrous famine—constitute not an asset but a heavy liability. But unfortunately even this does not describe the sum total of the cost of bureaucratic leadership. For in addition to the bureaucratic methods of carrying out the plan was the bureaucratic conception of the plan itself. Stubbornly striving to make Socialism in one country an economic reality, economic self-sufficiency became the goal of the plan. Even with the vastness of Russia and the variety of its natural resources—which alone made even the posing of such a question possible—the aim of economic self-sufficiency was bound to exact its price in the lowering of productivity. Not to take full advantage of the benefits of world trade so long as such trade was possible, not to realise the advantages of directing efforts towards production of those commodities in whose production Russia possessed a relative advantage internationally and not a relative disadvantage, and instead to aim at producing all internal needs whatever the labour cost involved was bound to impose unnecessary burdens on the working class and to lower the possible rate of expansion. That the building of the industry (and specially of heavy industry) was a necessity was obvious. The building of those industries supplying necessaries the import of which would not be possible in time of war, was equally necessary. If the supply of vital and necessary commodities were in this manner provided for, in the event of war, a policy of judicious organisation of the production of substitutes for other less necessary commodities, as capitalist governments do in time of war, is certainly not beyond the capacity of a workers’ state. But as for the rest of the economy, to have pursued a policy of producing those commodities most favourable for the purpose of international trade, and consequently to have derived the fullest advantages of world trade at least cost to Russia herself, would indubitably have imposed the least strain on the economy, have contributed vastly more to the raising of the standard of living, and considerably accelerated the rate of expansion. But the Stalinist bureaucracy blind to these elementary truths, intent only on proving the correctness of their theory of Socialism in one country, stubbornly embarked on a plan of economic self-sufficiency and to that extent impeded the success of the economic advance of the country. Finally it remains to be said that such a plan can achieve its proper results only in co-operation with the masses. The bureaucratic control of the Soviets and trade unions, which meant the substitution of compulsion for co-operation, of orders from above for mass initiative, of face-saving for genuine criticism, was another liability that the plan had to face. The frequent breakdowns and disorganisations—punished by the bureaucracy as “wrecking” and “sabotage”—of which we hear so much, are the inevitable result of the bureaucratic attempt to substitute itself for the masses. The bureaucracy attempts to solve the problems it has created in its own bureaucratic manner by terror. But no solution is possible on those lines. The solution can only come through the revival of workers’ democracy and the utilisation of those now latent forces liberated by the revolution of October 1917. When one considers the numerous liabilities from which the plan has had to suffer through bureaucratic stubbornness, inefficiency, short-sightedness and callousness, what is surprising is that so great advances have been made despite them. That the Russian workers were able to achieve so much in spite of the follies and brutalities of the bureaucrat is but added proof of the greatness of the social transformation effected by the October revolution, and can only reinforce the faith of the revolutionist and strengthen his resolve. ****** A disproportionate amount of space may appear to have been devoted to international developments in the Soviet Union in a work that claims to be an account and a brief one at that of the international revolutionary movement. But the changing policies of the Comintern cannot be understood except in the context of the internal developments of the Soviet Union, with which they have a close and organic connection. The pro-kulak policy till 1928 of the bureaucracy found its reflection in the international field in a Rightist policy of unity with the Social Democrats and “revolutionary” bourgeois leaders in the colonies. With the anti-kulak drive and industrialisation plans from 1929 onwards we find a corresponding ‘about turn’ to ultra-leftism in the international field. The rise of bureaucracy, we have attempted to show had the most profound implications for the Comintern, which was progressively converted from an organisation for international. revolution into a passive instrument of the bureaucracy. Hitherto the policies of the Comintern had but reflected the shifting and vacillating policies of the bureaucracy. But from now on they take a more sinister character. In the succeeding chapters we shall see the Comintern in its final stage of degeneration, in which it proves itself to be the abject instrument of the foreign policy of the Soviet bureaucrats.  Endnotes [1] Trotsky of course, at that time had not yet perceived the growth of a parasitic bureaucratic caste with special privileges and a standard of living becoming more and more widely separated from that of the masses, which was destined to consume an ever increasing proportion of the national income. [2] The expulsion of the Opposition at the end of 1927 was followed up by a series of expulsions in the International.

Leslie Goonewardene
Rise And Fall Of The Comintern
The First And Second Internationals
Chapter One
THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL
The International Workingmen’s Association—the famous First International—was founded in London on 28th of September 1864. After the massacre of French workers in 1848 and the collapse of the Chartist movement in England in the forties, the international working class movement had entered a period of ebb. Since these defeats the workers had concentrated mainly on the economic struggle for reforms. But after 1857 there re-opened a period of political activity on the part of the European working class. The political reawakening of the workers soon revived the idea of internationalism and led to the formation of the First International.
Marx was the soul of this organisation, and drafted its inaugural appeal, which stated that the emancipation of the working class must be the task of the workers themselves; that their emancipation could be achieved only by the abolition of class rule altogether; that the economic subjugation of the workers to the capitalist owners of the means of production was the cause of servitude in all its forms; and that the cause of emancipation of the pro-letariat was an international one demanding the interna-tional solidarity of the working class. Under Marx’s leadership the International proceeded to unite the labour movements of the various countries as well as to fight against various unscientific Socialist theories and trends.
As a result of the economic crisis of 1866 a wave of strikes swept over the advanced capitalist countries. In supporting and guiding these strikers and in mobilizing the international solidarity of the proletariat in their favour the International proved itself to be a very valuable weapon in the hands of the workers. Despite the opposition of the bourgeoisie and police prosecution the Inter-national grew in strength and became the recognized international organization of the working class.
In 1871 occurred the historic Paris Commune, in which the Paris workers seized power. In the famous address issued by the International Workingmen’s Association in September 1870, Marx had warned the French proletariat against an untimely uprising. But when in 1871 the armed uprising actually took place the International. Workingmen’s Association supported it, and its Parisian members were among the most capable and gallant fighters on behalf of the Commune.
But following on the defeat of the Paris Commune, the European proletariat entered on a period of reaction and retreat. The support of the International in England, France and Germany as well as in the smaller countries of Europe swiftly declined. United repression by the several governments of Europe and the split caused by the anarchist Bakuninists hastened the decline. In 1872 Marx carried through the transfer of the headquarters of the General Council of the International to New York. The International was formally dissolved in 1876.
However, the first International had played its historic role in guiding the International Workers’ movement for a decade and permeating the workers’ movement with the ideas of revolutionary socialism. There now followed a period of formation and growth of mass Socialist labour parties in separate countries on a scale hitherto unknown. In 1878 Marx wrote in an English publication attacking the contention that the International had been a failure. “In reality the Social-Democratic Workers’ parties in Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Holland and North America, organized more or less within national frontiers, represent just as many international groups, no longer isolated sections sparsely distributed over various countries and held together by a General Council on the periphery, but rather the working class it-self in constant, active and direct connection … Thus, far from dying out the International has developed from one stage into another and higher one, in which many of its original tendencies have already been fulfilled.” (See Mehring—Karl Marx , page 483). The period of the First International, we should note, was one in which the Euro-pean mass parties had not yet arisen. The backbone of the First International had been the English trade unions which at that time took an interest in working class poli-tics. Although it included several small parties and groups in Europe and America the only genuine mass labour party it contained had been the party in Germany.
THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL,
During the eighties, Marxist parties arose in most of the European countries, and in 1889 combined in the Second International. During this era the Socialist parties succeeded in winning the allegiance of a majority of the industrial workers in Germany, France, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, Scan-dinavia and Russia. In England however, where the trade unions were now confining their activities purely to the economic field, a Socialist mass party, failed to develop. In America too, the Socialist Party formed in 1901 did not gain a mass backing.
The largest and best organized of the parties of the Second International was the Social-Democratic Party of Germany which by 1914 had secured nearly one-third of the total number of seats in the Reichstag. The Social Democratic Workers’ Party of Russia, too, held an im-portant position in the International on account of the revolutionary character of the movement in that country and the theoretical ability of its leaders, particularly Plekhanov. The outstanding Marxist theoreticians of the Second International were Plekhanov and Karl Kautsky, while the political leader was Bebel.
International Congresses were held in Amsterdam in 1904, Stuttgart in 1907, Copenhagen in 1910 and Basle in 1912. At the last named conference a resolution against the approaching war was passed, incorporating and developing the decisions of the previous congresses on this subject. In the event of the outbreak of war the decision was “to intervene in favour of its speedy termination and … to utilise the economic and political crises created by the war to arouse the people and thereby to hasten the downfall of capitalist class rule.” This Manifesto of the Basle Congress of November 1912 was signed by all the Socialist parties of the world.
And yet, despite this resolution, on the outbreak of the first Imperialist World War in August 1914, a majority of the parties of the Second International openly supported the war, voting war credits and in certain cases even taking office in the government. Only the Socialist parties of Russia and Serbia opposed the war. (Later, when Italy entered the war, the Italian Socialist party also opposed the war, but taking a pacifist altitude). The âsocial-patriotism’ of the parties of the Second International seems all the more surprising when one considers the fact that the leaders of all these parties considered themselves to be Marxists, or at least freely used the name and ideology of Marx.
But it would be a mistake to imagine that the capitula-tion of the leaders of the Second International to the bourgeoisie of their respective countries in 1914 was a sudden lapse for which the basis had not been laid well in advance. Viewed historically, the betrayal of 1914 appears not as a sudden deviation from the policies that had in-creasingly been gaining acceptance among the leaders of the Second International parties in the preceding years, but as the logical culmination of them. The growth of opportunism in the parties of the Second International had for several years prior to 1914 been an open secret in European Social-Democratic circles. Lenin defined the ingredients of opportunism as being the replacement of revolutionary by reformist aims; the rejection of the class struggle and the adoption of class collaboration; the neg-lect of illegal organisation and activities in times of crisis; and in war time, the denial of the internationalism of the working class combined with the preaching of bourgeois patriotism. There were, to be sure, in most of the parties left wing elements untainted by the opportunist politics of the leaders. But the only groups of any magnitude were the Bolsheviks in Russia and the Rosa Luxembourg group in Germany. The opportunist leadership of the majority of the Second International parties, following a policy of limiting their activities to trade unionism and parliamen-tarism in peace time, found no difficulty in accommodating themselves to the “defence of the fatherland” slogan in time of war.
By attributing the betrayal of 1914 to the growth of opportunism in the parties of the Second International, however, we by no means exhaust the problem. Oppor-tunism is a political trend and no political trend grows in a vacuum. It remains to trace the roots, that is, to un-cover the social basis of the opportunism of the Second International.
The beginning of the European working class movement of the 19th century had been stormy. The Chartist movement in England in the forties, the struggle of the French workers in 1848 and still more their heroism in the Commune of 1871, the militant struggles of the German workers in 1848 and even after 1878 against the anti-Labour Laws of Bismarck were characteristic of the universally militant nature and revolutionary temper of the early European working class movement. The course of capitalist development in these years did not permit the rise of reformist illusions in the working class move-ment. That is how it came to pass that both Marx and Engels, quite correctly on the basis of the objective condi-tions of the time, though proved incorrect by the subsequent course of historical development, visualised the proletarian revolution not as a distant event to be measured even in decades, but as an imminent practical problem of their time.
But with its entry into the stage of Monopoly and Imperialism in the last quarter of the 19th Century, Capitalism obtained a new lease of life. Capitalism, already decrepit and torn asunder by its internal contra-dictions was able to enter on another period of expansion of trade and industry through the ruthless exploitation of colonies under imperialism. In all the great European countries, and particularly in Britain, the growth of im-perialism and the accumulation of super-profits enabled the bourgeoisie of these countries to grant concessions and win over a small and privileged upper stratum of workers as well as to gain the support of sections of the petty bour-geoisie benefiting from imperialism. (These sections had no interest in revolution, but only in defending their right to a share of the spoils of imperialist exploitation). This was the social basis of the opportunism of the Second International. Resting for their main support on these layers, the opportunist leaders were able, through the trade union bureaucracy, to permeate the working class movement with reformist and class-collaborationist ideas in peace time and to lead the workers into the camp of the bourgeois patriots on the outbreak of the imperialist war.

Rise And Fall Of The Comintern
The Fourth International
Chapter Eleven
THE FOUNDATION OF THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL
The historical roots of the Fourth International we have already traced to the Opposition which arose at the end of 1923 in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union under the leadership of Leon Trotsky. But the growth of the Left Opposition in the Communist Parties outside the Soviet Union had been much hampered in the years following, due to the strict censorship maintained by the bureaucratised Comintern as well as to the tissue of falsehoods and misrepresentations by which it had confused the real issues. The deportation, however, of Trotsky to Turkey in 1929, and the relative freedom he enjoyed there, enabled large numbers of Oppositionists and militant communists outside the Soviet Union to learn the truth for the first time and to benefit from the theoretical and
practical guidance of Trotsky. In 1930 the International Left Opposition was established at a world conference held in Paris. When the capitulation of Stalinism to Hitler in 1933 made it clear that there was no prospect of regenerating the Comintern, the International Left Opposition boldly proclaimed the need of organising a new, communist, Fourth International. Increasing in strength, and joined by new parties in Germany and Holland, the International Left Opposition, renamed the International Communist League, took the initiative in calling the first international Conference for the Fourth International, which was held at Geneva in July 1936. This conference served the purpose of bringing together the international forces of the 4th International in a new organisation, equipping them ideologically, and creating an authentic international guiding centre. The Conference appointed a General Council, an International Secretariat and a Bureau, and decided that a draft programme be produced, after the discussion of which arrangements should be made for the calling of a regular constituent (first) congress of the 4th International.
The 4th International movement now entered on a period in which its still small national parties and groups entered the sections of the 2nd International in various countries for the purpose of taking advantage of the leftward move taking place among the socialist workers in order to draw them into the revolutionary current of the 4th International. This policy led to an increase in strength, particularly of the sections in France, Belgium and the U.S.A. In this same period the movement shed sectarians and ultra-leftists who had joined it in the beginning. These, together with nearly all the groups of centrists have since then disappeared into oblivion. Certainly, the only revolutionary internationalist current which has survived and expanded has been that of the 4th International.
The 4th International (World Party of the Socialist Revolution) was formally founded at a World Congress held in September 1938 in Switzerland. Shortly before the Conference the G.P.U. kidnapped and brutally murdered Rudolf Klement, secretary of the 4th International Bureau. But despite all difficulties, created by the bourgeois police and the G.P.U., the Conference met in secret and successfully concluded its labours. 30 delegates, representing organisations in the United States, France, Great Britain, Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, Latin America, Poland, Belgium, Holland and Greece were present. Organisations affiliated to the 4th International in Spain, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Indo-China, China, French Morocco, South Africa, Canada, several Latin American countries, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, Lithuania, Palestine and Rumania, were unable to send delegates because of conditions of distance, illegality and other difficulties.
The Transitional Programme adopted at the Conference pointed out that the old social-democratic practice (followed by the Comintern) of dividing its programme into “maximum” and “minimum” programmes having no bridge between them, had no reality today. For, in the present era of the decline of capitalism, no serious demand of the masses is capable of solution within the framework of capitalist property relations and of the bourgeois state. “The present epoch,” it declared, “is distinguished not for the fact that it frees the revolutionary party from day to day work, but because it permits this work to be carried on indissolubly with the tasks of the revolution ... The task of the transitional programme lies in the systematic mobilisation of the masses for the proletarian revolution.” This programme, based on the experience of the sections of the 4th International, provided the international working class with the bridge between its demands today and the programme of proletarian revolution. Not the least significance of the Conference lay in the fact that at the most critical time, with the entire world already under the shadow of the approaching war, of all political tendencies in the workers’ movement, the only organisation to convene its international congress was the 4th International.
Roughly coinciding with the holding of its conference and the adoption of the programme of transitional demands, the 4th International entered a new period, in which its sections began to evolve into parties with a mass base. This was clearly so in the case of the Socialist Workers’ Party in America, and was also true of the sections of the 4th International in French Indo-China and Latin America. With the advent of the imperialist war, everywhere the inevitable repression naturally fell with the most severity on the intransigent revolutionaries of the 4th International. But they worked everywhere, swimming against the current in some places, helping to direct the stream in others; enjoying comparative freedom as in America, and secretly printing and publishing their organ under penalty of death as in France. The sections of the 4th International entered the war welded together by a common doctrine and armed with a revolutionary Marxist programme, confident that it is they and they alone who can lead humanity out of its impasse.
The Bolshevik-Leninists have always stood for the unconditional defence of the Soviet Union. The thesis on “The Fourth International and the Soviet Union”, passed at the 1936 Conference declared: "The proletarian vanguard of the entire world will support the U.S.S.R. in war, in spite of the parasitic bureaucracy and of the uncrowned Negus in the Kremlin, because the social regime of the U.S.S.R., despite all its deformations and ulcers represents an enormous historical step forward in comparison with putrified capitalism ... The defeat of the Soviet Union would not only signify the collapse of the Soviet bureaucracy but also the replacement of the state and collective property by capitalist chaos”.
It is a noteworthy fact that their hostility to the Stalin regime did not prevent the German Trotskyists from informing the Soviet Government through the Soviet embassy in Berlin, several weeks in advance of the intended attack on the Soviet Union, including the names of the divisions to be used—information that was no doubt taken into account in the plans of defence adopted. (Nation , New York.)
The parties of the 4th International are the staunchest defenders of the Soviet Union, even though that defence may be led by the bureaucracy. But they make it clear that even while defending the Soviet Union they do not give up the struggle against the bureaucratic apparatus. Nor can considerations of the defence of the Soviet Union ever justify the abandonment of the path of international revolution. “We must formulate our slogans in such a way that the workers see clearly just what we are defending in the U.S.S.R. (state property and planned economy), and against whom we are conducting a ruthless struggle (the parasitic bureaucracy and their Comintern). We must not lose sight for a single moment of the fact that the question of overthrowing the Soviet bureaucracy is for us subordinate to the question of preserving state property in the means of production of the U.S.S.R.; that the question of preserving state property in the means of production in the Soviet Union is subordinate for us to the question of the world proletarian revolution”. (Trotsky, “The U.S.S.R. in the War,” Socialist Appeal , October 10, 1939).
The Trotskyists were not taken unawares by events. They had carefully worked out well in advance the policies, which the proletariat in countries allied to the Soviet Union, as well as in countries fighting against the Soviet Union, should follow in wartime. The theses of the 4th International on war, adopted by the International Secretariat as far back as May 1934, declared: “Remaining the determined and devoted defender of the workers’ state in the struggle with imperialism, the proletarian will not, however, become an ally of the imperialist allies of the U.S.S.R. The proletariat of a capitalist country which finds itself in alliance with the U.S.S.R. must retain fully and completely its irreconcilable hostility to the imperialist government of its own country” (“The 4th International and War”).
But this does not mean that the proletariat opposes every action of the imperialist ally of the Soviet Union. “For instance, it would be absurd and criminal in case of war between the U.S.S.R. and Japan for the American proletariat to sabotage the sending of American munitions to the U.S.S.R.” (Ibid ). The parties of the 4th International in countries allied to the Soviet Union give tacit support to the sending of military supplies by their own imperialist governments to the USSR, but at the same time they fight for independent working class aid to the Soviet Union, that is, for effective direct support (including military support) controlled by the proletariat.
The parties of the 4th international in countries fighting the Soviet Union are pledged not only to struggle for the revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeoisie in their own countries, but also to resort to all actions (including sabotage) calculated to disrupt the military operations against the Soviet Union. “However during an imperialist war there may be cases where a revolutionary party will be forced to resort to military-technical means, though they do not as yet follow directly from the revolutionary movement in their own country. Thus, if it is a question of sending arms or troops against a workers’ government or a rebellious colony, not only such methods as boycott and strike, but direct military sabotage may become entirely practical and obligatory. Resorting or not resorting to such measures will be a matter of practical possibilities”. (Trotsky, “Learn to Think”, New International , July 1938.)
The situation that has arisen after the conclusion of the war has re-affirmed the correctness of the Trotskyist position that the only real defence of the Soviet Union lies in international revolution. The echoes of the guns of war had hardly died away before the diplomatic guns of the imperialists were trained on the Soviet Union. Despite Stalin’s war-time dreams of a lengthy period of peace-time collaboration of the Soviet Union with imperialism, reality is demonstrating that the two different and contradictory social systems cannot exist side by side indefinitely. American imperialism, the big winner of World War II has constituted itself the organiser and spearhead of the united capitalist war of intervention that it is preparing against the Soviet Union. Today more than ever before it is international revolution alone that can save the first workers’ state.
THE IMPERIALIST WAR
The 4th International had its line in relation to the imperialist war laid down well in advance. It declared that the war that was approaching was not a war between Democracy and Fascism, but an imperialist war fought for colonies and world domination. “A new partition of the world is on the order of the day,” wrote Trotsky in an article entitled “On the Character of the Coming War” in the New International  of December 1938. “The first step in the revolutionary education of the workers must be to develop the ability to perceive beneath the official formulae, slogans and hypocritical phrases, the real imperialist appetites, plans and calculations.” “Imperialism is inevitably and irresistibly heading to a redivision of the world, corresponding to the changed relation of forces. To prevent the catastrophe, imperialism must be strangled. All other methods are fictions, illusions, lies.” “At present, after the fresh experience of Czechoslovakia, there is no necessity, it seems, to demonstrate that the imperialists are fighting one another not for political principles but for domination over the world under the cover of any principles that will serve their purpose ... To substitute political or moral abstractions for the actual aims of the warring imperialist camps is not to fight for democracy, but to help the brigands disguise their robbery, pillage and violence. This is now precisely the main function of the Second and Third Internationals.”
The 4th International stood for the application of the Leninist policy of revolutionary defeatism in relation to the imperialist war. That is to say, its parties stood for the full utilisation of the difficulties of the government due to the war, the intensified prosecution of the class struggle and its orientation towards the proletarian seizure of power, all in complete disregard of the adverse military consequences that result to one’s own imperialist government in the prosecution of the war.
THE FUTURE
No political tendency in world history has been subjected to the persecution which the movement represented by the 4th International has suffered. Lies, calumny, imprisonment, torture, execution and assassination have been the methods used by the despotic bureaucrats, in their frantic effort to destroy the irreconcilable proletarian revolutionary tendency. And it has been not only a question of the terror in the Soviet Union. In the capitalist countries of the world the Bolshevik-Leninists have been forced, in increasing measure, to meet not only the repression of the imperialist bourgeoisie and the opposition of the Social Democrats, but also the ruthless vindictiveness of the agents of Stalin abroad. Gigantic campaign of distortion and lies, backed by unlimited financial resources, diplomatic pressure brought to bear by the Kremlin on capitalist governments to hide the truth and to increase still further the obstacles in the path of the Bolshevik-Leninists, and even the commissioning of G.P.U. gangsters to assassinate prominent 4th Internationalists, have been among the measures adopted by Stalin to fight the movement of the 4th International outside the boundaries of the Soviet Union.
The persecution of Leon Trotsky and his family serves to illustrate the bitter personal tragedy and heroic martyrdom suffered at the hands of the Stalinist Inquisition alone in the effort to build the 4th International. Of Trotsky’s four children, Nina died of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1928, after her husband had been arrested as an oppositionist and she had consequently been deprived of all opportunity of adequate treatment; Zinaida was driven to suicide in Berlin in 1933 after she had been arbitrarily deprived of her Soviet citizenship by the Soviet Government, and had become homeless and destitute; Sergei, Trotsky’s son, who had not participated in political activity of any kind, was arrested in the Soviet Union in 1935, was charged of planning the mass poisoning of workers, and has not been heard of since; Leon Sedov, Trotsky’s other son, close collaborator of his father, intransigent revolutionist and fearless fighter in the cause of the 4th International, died under suspicious circumstances in Paris in 1938.
Trotsky himself, driven from Turkey to France, and France to Norway; consequent on the diplomatic pressure brought to bear by the Soviet Government on the governments of these countries; was finally ordered in 1936 to leave Norway by the Norwegian Government for the same reason. Where could he go? Residence in Germany, Italy or any Fascist country was of course impossible. Czechoslovakia and England had refused him visas, and America had shown it would do the same. There was only one government that would readily accept him, and that was the Government of the Soviet Union, in order to kill him. Stalin, who had committed the mistake of deporting him to Turkey in 1929, was now trying to get him back to the Soviet Union and remedy that error. Trotsky was finally able to find asylum in Mexico. The G.P.U. now set about in earnest to assassinate Trotsky. Several plans were made. The attempt of an armed gang to machine-gun him together with his wife and grandson in their home in Mexico in May 1939 failed due to the presence of mind of Trotsky. Three months later the Stalinist agent Jackson alias Jacques Monard succeeded in his attempt and the international proletarian movement lost its greatest living leader.
In the past under the combined blows of the imperialist police and the gangsters of Stalin, the movement of the 4th International has shown that it possessed tremendous reserves of strength. Today, despite the irreparable loss of its founder and guide, it is proving this anew. If Stalin hoped by the brutal murder of Trotsky to crush the 4th International, he has failed. For the movement of the 4th International, its roots springing from the life problems of modern society in travail, is the revolutionary tendency representing the historical interests of the international proletariat.
The persecution of the international Bolshevik-Leninists and the gigantic campaign of falsehood levelled against them by the Stalintern is no doubt one of the causes for the comparatively slow growth of the 4th International movement in the past. It is not an easy task for a revolutionary group, weak in numbers, and still weaker in financial means, to compete successfully against a vast organisation backed by the resources of an entire state, particularly when that organisation is exploiting the revolutionary traditions of the October revolution. But much more important than all this has been the general decay of the workers’ movement in the past fifteen years, deepened in turn by each fresh betrayal of the Comintern.
The revolutionary party gains strength and grows in a period of rise, and it shrinks, sometimes to a mere handful, in a period of defeats and decline. The Bolsheviks in Russia rose to a commanding position in 1905, but in the period of reaction from 1908 to 1913 they were reduced to scattered groups. In the first period of the war of 1914-18, when a wave of patriotism carried everything before it, they were reduced to the illegal existence of a hunted sect. But this did not prevent them from leading the victorious revolution in October 1917. And the obstacles in the path of the international Bolshevik-Leninists have been much greater. It is true, their analyses and predictions had been borne out by events over and over again. Nevertheless the disastrous defeats to which the Stalintern has led the workers, and the resulting disillusionment and apathy of the masses have adversely affected, not least of all, the revolutionary movement of international Bolshevism. The Bolshevik-Leninists have been forced to wait patiently for a turn in the tide.
As Trotsky says , “I remember some discussion in 1927 in Moscow after Chiang Kai Shek stifled the Chinese workers. We predicted this ten days before and Stalin opposed us with the argument that Borodin was vigilant, that Chiang Kai Shek would not have the possibility to betray us, etc. I believe that it was eight or ten days later that the tragedy occurred and our comrades expressed optimism because our analysis was so clear that everyone would see it and we would be sure to win the party. I answered that the strangulation of the Chinese revolution is a thousand times more important for the masses than our predictions. Our predictions can win some few intellectuals who take an interest in such things but not the masses. The military victory of Chiang Kai Shek will inevitably provoke a depression and this is not conducive to the growth of a revolutionary fraction”. (“Fighting against the Stream”, Fourth International , May 1941).
And again, “Dilettantes, Charlatans, or blockheads incapable of probing into the dialectic of historic ebbs and flows have more than once brought in their verdict “The ideas of the Bolshevik-Leninists may, perhaps, be correct but they are incapable of building a mass organisation.” As if a mass organisation can be built under any and all conditions! As if a revolutionary programme does not render it obligatory for us to remain in the minority and swim against the stream in an epoch of reaction! That revolutionist is worthless who uses his own impatience as a measuring rod for the tempo of an epoch. Never before has the path of the world revolutionary movement been blocked with such monstrous obstacles as it is today on the eve of a new epoch of greatest revolutionary convulsion. (“A Great Achievement”, New International , October 1938).
With the conclusion of the Second Imperialist World War there has opened up a new period of revolutionary upheaval. The question is, will the workers of the world succeed in overthrowing capitalism and ushering in the socialist society, or will the capitalist monster succeed in defeating these struggles and move on to an atomic war a thousand times more destructive than the last? On the answer to this question hangs the fate of humanity. We recollect that Marx, while considering socialism to be historically inevitable as the next stage in the evolution of human society, at the same time went on to add that there was another alternative—namely, a return to barbarism. It must be admitted that never did this dread alternative assume before a reality as it has done today. But we, who have faith in the masses and their capacity to achieve, reject the perspective of decline and defeat. Driven to desperation by capitalism, and betrayed by the social reformists and Stalinists, the masses will find no other leadership than that offered by the Trotskyists. The coming world revolution will unfold under the banner of the Fourth International.

 Goonewardene: Rise And Fall Of The Comintern: Chapter 3



Leslie Goonewardene
Rise And Fall Of The Comintern
The Decline Of The Comintern
Chapter Three
The German Defeat Of October 1923
The German events of 1923 form the breaking point that inaugurates a new post-Leninist period of the Comintern. Lenin had fallen ill in the middle of 1922, and except for a brief period at the end of 1922 was no longer in active work and available to give his invaluable guidance in matters both internal and international. Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev were at the head of affairs. When the German events matured in 1923 Trotsky was already out of the secret council of this “triumvirate” as it was popularly known.
After the occupation of the Ruhr region by French troops early in 1923 a revolutionary ferment swiftly grew in Germany. By summer, the German bourgeoisie was in a hopeless position and a revolutionary situation existed. But neither the German Communist Party nor the leader-ship of the Comintern realised this. Stalin wrote as follows to Zinoviev and Bukharin in August 1923 about the situation in Germany:
“Should the Communists (at the present stage) strive to seize power without the social democracy—are they ripe for this already—this, in my opinion, is the question ... If now in Germany, the power, so to say, will fall and the Communists will seize it, they will fall through with a crash.... Certainly the Fascists are not napping, but it is more advantageous to us for the Fascists to attack first: this will rally the whole working class around the Com-munists. (Germany is not Bulgaria). Besides, the Fas-cists in Germany, according to the data we have, are weak. In my estimation the Germans must be restrained, and not spurred on.” These were in fact the views not only of Stalin but of his whole faction. The favourable opportunity passed. It was only at the end of September that the leadership of the Comintern became belatedly aware of what had happened. Even then the instructions to the German Communists were to enter the Social-Democratic Government in Saxony. The revolutionary situation “veered round to its opposite” and the offensive was taken by the Reaction. 9,000 workers were put on trial. Wage-cuts and increased hours followed, and the German events of 1923 ended in a bigger defeat than in 1921.
The 5th Congress met in June 1924 eight months after the defeat of the German proletariat. Its duty was to analyse the causes of the defeat and draw the necessary conclusions from it. Zinoviev and Bukharin threw the blame entirely on the shoulders of the Communist Party of Germany and absolved the leadership of the Comintern from blame. The Russian Opposition led by Trotsky which stated that the defeat was serious and that the Ger-man proletariat would take time to recover, was accused of a lack of faith in the proximity of the German and European revolutions, Trotsky himself was called a liquidator.[1] But the influence of the Communist Party of Germany declined in the following years, while the Social-Democrats who had been losing their influence in 1923, grew. It was not till after four years (till 1928) that the German prole-tariat began to advance again. The correctness of the criticism of the Russian Opposition was proved to the hilt.
But the leadership of the Comintern refused to realise that the post-war revolutionary wave on the continent of Europe was receding. Throughout 1924 they kept re-peating that Germany and Europe were on the verge of revolution. It is not surprising therefore, that the years 1924-25 were years of Left mistakes and putschist experi-ments. The Bulgarian putschist experiment of September 1923 and the Esthonian armed uprising of December 1924, both of which resulted in crushing defeats, were the direct result of the wrong policy of the leadership of the Comin-tern.
It was in these years that Stalin first invented his theory of Social Fascism. When it is able to do so, we know, the bourgeoisie rules through the form of government known as bourgeois democracy, utilising the social-democracy to deceive the masses. It is when the bourgeoisie is faced with an imminent revolutionary danger that it resorts to fascism. Social-democracy and Fascism are of course, two poles of the bourgeois front, but two poles nevertheless, and it is necessary to distinguish between them. But Stalin lumped these two together and laid down that “Social-Democracy is objectively a moderate wing of Fascism.” This incorrect over-simplification, as we shall see, led to the victory of German Fascism in 1933.
BUREAUCRATIC DISMISSALS OF LEADERS
Very soon, the most important communist parties, following the decisions of the 5th Congress (of 1924,) began to lose their influence. This was the result of the ultra-left policies followed. The leaders of these parties were now suddenly branded “ultra-leftists” removed violently by the Comintern, and other leaders put in their place. This practice of bureaucratic dismissal of leaders by the Comintern heads for having reaped the disastrous results of the wrong policies imposed by the Comintern leadership itself, hastened the degeneration of the Comintern. As, early as 1921 Lenin had warned Zinoviev and Btakharin by letter pointing out that if they demanded nothing but approbation in the International they would surround themselves exclusively with “Obedient fools.”
Not long before the dismissal of leaders for ultra-leftism, there had taken place (in the ultra-left period of 1924-5) a series of dismissals of leaders,	who, together with the Opposition, had maintained the post-war revolutionary wave was now at an ebb. In 1924, in France, the leadership of Souverine and Rosmer had been accused of sympathies with the Opposition and been replaced by the “Left” leadership of Treint and Girault. In Germany Brandler and Thalheimer had been replaced by Fischer and Maslow. In Poland Varsky had been replaced by the “Left” Domsky. But none of these new leaders as we have seen, lasted long either. By 1926 Treint and Girault were expelled from the party and replaced by Doriot, Barbe and Thorez. Fischer and Maslow were expelled and replaced by Thaelmann and Neumann. The Domsky group was expelled and replaced by a new leadership. If in more recent times, such expulsions have not been so common, that is only because the leaders of the Communist Parties have degenerated into paid agents of the Comintern who merely carry out instructions and are ready to change policy to meet the demands of the latest communique from Moscow. Today they take all the blame for the mistakes of the Comintern leadership, and there is no necessity to expel them.
These changes of leadership in 1926 coincided with an abrupt change in the policy of the Comintern in 1925-6 from the previous disastrous one of ultra-leftism to the even more disastrous one of rightism. The policies of the Comintern in future, we shall notice, consist of a series of zig-zags. Driven from one extreme to another by the disastrous results of their policies both in the U.S.S.R. and outside, the bureaucracy will transform the Third Inter-national from a powerful weapon for international revolu-tion into an abject instrument of the foreign policy of the Soviet bureaucrats. The revolutionary International of Lenin will be transformed into a reactionary organization betraying the cause of World Revolution. Not only in policy but in personnel the International of Stalin will bear no resemblance to that founded by Lenin in 1919. The leaders of the October revolution, the militant rank and the Bolsheviks who refused to leave the revolutionary path will be persecuted, imprisoned and physically exterminated. The only resemblance between the Internationals of Lenin and Stalin will be in the name.
THE ANGLO-RUSSIAN COMMITTEE
The abrupt change to a rightist policy in 1925 led to even mow serious disasters to the international movement than occurred in the ultra-leftist period of 1923-5. The chief defeats were in Britain and China.
Late in 1924 a British trade union delegation led by Purcell, the president of the TUC, visited Russia, inspected he achievements of the Soviet Government and returning England issued a glowing report. As a result of this visit, in May 1925 there was formed the Anglo-Russian iiittee composed of representatives of the British and Russian trade union movements. The purpose of the Committee was stated to be to promote international trade union unity, to struggle against capitalist reaction and against the danger of new wars. The General Council of the TUC of Britain, composed of reformist labour leaders desired this committee, because, with the growing militancy of the British Workers at this time, association with Russia protected their popularity. But the Anglo-Russian Committee was useful also to the revolutionary movement It focussed the attention of the advanced workers on Russia; it helped to unite and mobilize large sections of the workers for the first step in a struggle against capitalist reaction. However, the reformist leaders being reformists would side with their own bourgeoisie in a critical situation. It was necessary for the revolutionaries to realise this and to prepare to expose them mercilessly when they did so. But this was precisely what the Comintern leadership (at that time, of Stalin and Bukharin) failed to realise and accom-plish.
The Opposition did not oppose the formation of the Anglo-Russian Committee, but they recognized it for what it was, and pointed out the danger of expecting the re-formist leaders to take part in any genuine struggle. Their arguments were not dealt with, but they were accused by the ruling clique of opposing the united front and of being in the pay of Sir Austen Chamberlain!
At this time Trotsky wrote a book called “Where is Britain Going?” (February 1926) in which he mercilessly attacked the reformist trade union leaders of Britain. “The Communist Party” he wrote, “can prepare for the role of leadership only by a relentless criticism of all the directing personnel of the British Labour Movement, only by a day in day out denunciation of its conservative, anti-proletarian, imperialistic, monarchistic, lackey-like role, in all spheres of social life and of the class movement.” The book was in effect a reply to the illusions that Stalin and his Rightist bureaucrats were sewing in the minds of British and Russian workers alike.
A strike of the British coal miners occurred in early 1926 and led to the General Strike commencing at the beginning of May of that year. A general strike is not an accident but a political phenomenon arising from the profound crisis of the capitalist system. It is a class war in its most acute pre-revolutionary stage. The next step leads to the openly revolutionary stage. But in order to develop the struggle to its higher stage there is required a working class party pursuing a correct policy.
The British Communist Party in 1926 was small. But size is not everything. It worked hard before the struggle, but the wrong policy of the International prevented it from preparing the working class in advance for the treachery of the reformist trade union leaders. Worse still, for a long time after these leaders had betrayed the workers the Communist Party was prevented by the ac-tions of the International from exposing them. After nine days of the General Strike, the reformist leaders, succumbing to the pressure of their own bourgeoisie, called it off. Immediately the opposition demanded a break-away from the Anglo-Russian Committee and an exposure of the British leaders. Stalin and Bukharin however violently opposed this, and persisted in sticking to these now useless allies for more than a year longer.
Towards the end of 1926, the Chinese revolution was advancing with tremendous force towards its high water-mark. The British reformist trade union leaders, apart from pious protests in theory, in practice supported British Imperialism in its repression of the movement in China. Yet Stalin continued to maintain this farcical united front. Towards the middle of 1927 the Chamberlain Govern-ment raided the Soviet Trade Buildings in London and broke off relations with Russia. The British Trade Union-ists who had now no longer any use of the Anglo-Russian Committee, openly withdrew from it of their own accord. The episode of the Anglo-Russian Committee provides us with a classic example of how the united front should not be made. A critical period in British politics had been wasted. Thanks to the policy of the Comintern the weak Communist Party of Great Britain, during a period when it could have enormously strengthened itself, was further confused and weakened.
******
In its Rightist period of 1925-27 the Comintern support-ed the building of “Workers’ and Peasants’ Parties” instead of “Communist parties” in most of the colonial and Asiatic countries (India, Dutch East Indies, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, etc.). This was contrary to the whole theory and practice of Marxism which points to the im-perative necessity of forming, an independent party of the proletariat. The un-Marxist policy of the Comintern disorganized and demoralised the proletarian vanguard in these countries and is one of the important causes for the weakness of proletarian parties in these countries today.

Rise And Fall Of The Comintern
The Rise Of The Bureaucracy
Chapter Five

We have sketched the disastrous policy of ultra-leftism pursued by the Comintern from 1923 to 1925 and the even more disastrous rightist policy adopted subse-quently, culminating in the tragic fate of the Chinese revolution. We have observed that these defeats were the direct result of the disregard of the strategic lessons of Marxism as developed by Lenin and Trotsky. How had it come about that the revolutionary International founded by Lenin had declined in this manner? We remarked earlier that no political trend grows in a vacuum, and found it necessary to discover the social bases of the opportunism of the 2nd International in its period of decline. Similarly no Marxist analysis of the 3rd International is complete without an attempt to discover the social basis—that is, the real historical reason—for its decline.
The Russian working class, by the privilege of its historical backwardness, as we might say, was able to make its revo-lution before any of the advanced countries of the West. But the moment it had made the leap ahead of these coun-tries it found itself forced to bear the full consequences of its own backwardness. That is to say, the Russian working class, a minority in a predominantly peasant country, on coming to power was faced with the problems of a low level of productivity in industry, a small scale and primi-tive agriculture, an exceedingly poor system of transport, illiteracy, and a host of other problems cultural as well as economic which were the heritage left to it by Czarism. To add to these difficulties, the Russian workers who had received the country in an exhausted condition after three years of imperialist war, were compelled for another three years to fight the armies of capitalist intervention at enor-mous cost to the country. The Russian working class might still have been able to solve the pressing problems before them if they had been helped, as their leaders had expected, by the spread of the revolution to the advanced European countries. However, although the revolutionary wave in Europe proved sufficient to save the young work-ers’ state in the first and most critical period of its exist-ence, nevertheless the revolution failed to conquer and gain a foothold in Europe. In these circumstances the ebb of the world revolution was reflected also within the workers’ state. There arose within the Communist party and the Soviets a bureaucracy, which substituted itself for the masses, and which proceeded to usurp the masses of political power by destroying internal democracy in the party, converting the Soviets into the instruments of the bureaucrats, and concentrating power in its hands.[1]
LENIN SEES THE DANGER
Lenin with his customary perspicacity was the first to note the alarming trend of the growth  of bureaucracy and to warn against it. As early as January, 1921, in an article on the trade union question, he wrote, “A workers’ state is an abstraction. Actually we have a workers’ state with this peculiarity, firstly, that it is not the working class po-pulation that predominate in the country, but the peasant population; and, secondly, it is worker’s state with the bureaucratic distortions.” (Selected Works of Lenin . Vol. 9, page 33).
In the spring of 1921, Lenin had introduced the change from War Communism to the policy of NEP. The mea-sures of premature socialism had been necessary during the period of civil war, and the peasant had supported these extreme measures because he knew that the defeat of the Bolsheviks would mean his losing the land. But once the civil war was over and the land safe, the peasant began first of all to refuse to produce and then to revolt. Under NEP Lenin abolished the system of requisition of grain, allowed the peasant to pay a tax in kind, and by degrees gave the peasant the right to trade.[2] NEP was a retreat, and a necessary retreat. But it had its danger. It gave an impetus to the development of the Kulak class and to the birth of new layers of exploiting elements in the Soviet Union. This factor accentuated the growth of the bureaucracy, which began to lean more and more on the kulaks, intellectual strata and labour aristocracy.
After the first victories of the Soviet regime had become apparent a large number of people who had nothing in common with revolution had found their way into the party. Lenin had drawn attention to this in 1921. “The party must be purged of rascals and bureaucrats” he wrote, “of dishonest or wavering communists,” and of Mensheviks who have repainted their âfaÃ§ade’ but who in their hearts have remained Mensheviks”. (Purging the Party, Selected Works , Vol. 9). In March 1922, when the policy of NEP was in full swing he deemed it necessary to repeat this warning. In a letter to Molotov demanding a longer period of probation for new members, he writes: “our party is less politically trained than is necessary for real proletarian leadership in the present difficult situation, especially in view of the overwhelming preponderance of the peasantry, which is rapidly awakening to independent class politics.”—(New condition of Party Membership, Selected Works , Vol. 9).
In the middle of 1922 Lenin fell ill and was away from work for five months till October. In this period of absence he was able to see more clearly than anyone else what was wrong with the party. He saw the monstrous growth of bureaucratic power and its concentration in the hands of the Organisation Bureau of the Central Committee, which was in Stalin’s charge as General Secretary of the party from 1921. Lenin saw that Stalin had made use of absence to build around him, by the one-sided selection of men, a numerous faction of personal supporters. Lenin came back in October with the firm determination of fight-ing these back stage manoeuvres of the Secretariat. But after only a few weeks, bad health forced him again to retire from the field of activities. It was then (January 1923) that he wrote his letter to the party which came to be known as his Testament. Here, he demands the removal of Stalin from the post of General Secretary.
“Comrade Stalin, having become General Secretary, has concentrated an enormous power in his hands; and I am not sure that he always knows how to use that power with sufficient caution,” he wrote. “Stalin is too rude, and this fact, entirely supportable in relations among us com-munists, becomes unsupportable in the office of General Secretary. Therefore, I propose to the Comrades to find a way to remove Stalin from that position and appoint another man who in all respects differs from Stalin only in superiority—namely, more patient, more loyal, more polite, and more attentive to comrades, less capricious, etc.”, he wrote in the postscript. (The Suppressed Testament of Lenin —Pioneer Publishers).
As long as there remained a glimmer of hope for Lenin’s recovery his wife Krupskaya kept the document under lock and key. In 1924, after Lenin’s death she handed it over to the Secretariat of the Central Committee with the request that it should be placed before the party Congress. Despite the insistence of Krupskaya this was not done. And after the reading of the document to a selected number of party leaders, the publication of the document was prohibited. The document has, however, seen the light of day, thanks to the Left Opposition.[3]
In his last article “Better less but Better” (4th March 1923), as a counter to the rising bureaucracy Lenin demands the reorganisation of the People’s Commissariat of Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, of which the Commissar was Stalin. He says that it is inevitable that this reform will meet the resistance of “all our bureaucracy,” both the Soviet and the party bureaucracy. “We have a bureau-cracy” he adds, “not only in the Soviet institutions, but in the party institutions.”
In March 1923, Lenin’s health finally broke down and he died in January 1924. During these months Stalin—in alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev—concentrated his personal hold by the intensive bureaucratisation of the party apparatus. The party bureaucracy and the bu-reaucracy of the State organisation were steadily fused into one. When Lenin died, the bureaucracy headed by Stalin were already in control of the party.
If Lenin had lived, there is no doubt that the bureaucracy would not have won so easily. But it is a matter for spe-culation to what extent even he, with his enormous pres-tige, would have been able to influence the course of events. There is a limit to the role of individuals, however great and powerful, in history. On this question, we can do no better than quote from Trotsky’s introduction to Lenin’s Testament  published by the Left Opposition.
“The course of subsequent events in the Kremlin and in the Soviet Union was determined not by a single docu-ment, even though it were the testament of Lenin, but by historical causes of a far deeper order. A political reaction after the enormous effort of the years of the insurrection and the civil war was inevitable. The concept of reactions must here be strictly distinguished from the concept of counter-revolution. Reaction does not necessarily imply a social overturn—that is, a transfer of power from one class to another. Even Czarism had its periods of progres-sive reform and its periods of reactions. The mood and orientations of the ruling class changes according to cir-cumstances. This is true also of the working class. The pressure of the Petty-bourgeoisie upon the proletariat tired from the tumult entailed a revival of petty bourgeois tendencies in the proletariat itself and a deep wave of re-action on the crest of which the present bureaucratic appa-ratus headed by Stalin rose to power.”
THE LEFT OPPOSITION
The Left Opposition took shape for the first time as a distinct political grouping in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1923, headed by Leon Trotsky. The 10th Party Congress under Lenin’s direction had adopt-ed a resolution for the vigorous execution of the policy of party democracy. The 12th Congress had in 1922 re-affirmed this resolution, but nothing had been done to implement it.
Consequently, on 8th October 1923, Trotsky wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the party expressing his views on this subject and on the national economy. “In the fiercest moments of War Communism the system of appointment within the party did not have one tenth of the extent it has now. Appointments of the secretaries of provincial committees is now the rule. That creates for the secretary a position essentially independent of the local organisation A very broad strata of party work-ers has been created, entering into the governing apparatus of the party who completely renounce their own party opinion, before whom every decision stands in the nature of a summons or command,” wrote Trotsky. He was followed by a letter signed by 46 party leaders who joined hands with him on most of the essential ideas he had set down.
Soon after, Trotsky was surrounded by a group which came to be known as the “Moscow Opposition” and which was in fact the beginning of the Left Opposition. Their aim was a genuine application of the resolution on party de-mocracy and the co-ordination of industry with agriculture on the basis of a plan in economy.
“Trotsky pointed out that the workers’ republic could overcome the obstacle of a primitively organised and managed agriculture and enter the broad highway towards socialism, only by laying a solid foundation in the form of a big scale machine industry. With such a base, the proletariat would be able to satisfy the needs of the peasantry for cheap manufactured products. By pursuing a policy of systematically reducing the economic and political importance of the exploiting peasants (the kulaks) it would commence in earnest the socialist transformation of an agriculture provided with the technical equipment of large industry.
“To accomplish these ends, Trotsky recommended the centralisation of national economy and its harmonious direction by means of a national long term plan, pointing to the success attained in 1920 by planned economy in the field of restoring the efficiency of railroad transportation”. (Max-Shachtmann—History and Principles of the Left Opposition ).
But the party apparatus was already in the control of the bureaucracy. What Trotsky wrote was twisted beyond recognition. He was accused of factionalism, of pitting the “Old Guard” against the Youth, of “underestimating the peasantry”. Trotsky’s supporters were removed from every position of influence and subjected to intimidation in office and in factory. Students were expelled from the Universities. The Red Army was purged. Rakovsky was sent to London, Krestinsky to Berlin. Lenin had said that more workers should be introduced into the party… In January 1924 Stalin’s secretariat shepherded 100,000 raw recruits into the party, and in May another 100,000 more. All were given the power to vote. The result of the 13th Party Congress held in May 1924 was a foregone conclusion. The Opposition were defeated. The public-ation of Lenin’s Testament, which Krupskaya had vainly attempted to have placed before the Conference, was prohibited.
In October 1924, Trotsky published his “Lessons of Octo-ber”. This was the signal for a widespread and concerted attack on him. The bogey of “Trotskyism” was invented. It was stated that “Trotskyism” was opposed to Leninism. The pre-war differences between Lenin and Trotsky were raked up, exaggerated, distorted, and a flood of articles and pamphlets let loose on a surprised public. The workers were confused and bewildered by the attacks on Trotsky whom they had learned to regard as co-leader with Lenin in the October revolution, organiser of the Red Army, and the foremost Bolshevik leader next to Lenin. But the workers were exhausted by the efforts in the period of civil war and they had received a crushing blow with the defeat of the German proletariat in 1923. The German defeat no doubt hastened the defeat of the Opposition. On the other hand, supporting the bureaucracy were the new class of kulaks and the traders in the towns, who had grown up under NEP.
But it took four years to drive the Left Opposition out of the party. The names of Lenin and Trotsky were too closely associated and the traditions of Leninism too deeply rooted.
ZINOVIEV AND KAMENEV JOIN THE OPPOSITION
Zinoviev and Kamenev in their role of old and very close colleagues of Lenin, had been the spear-head of the anti-Trotsky drive which commenced in 1924 but in 1925 differences began to develop between the Zinoviev-Kamenev group and the centrist group of Stalin. Matters came to a head on the question of Stalin’s theory of Socialism in one country. Zinoviev and Kamenev opposed this un-Marxist and anti-Leninist theory. Leaning on the âRights’ in the party (Bukharin, Rykov, and others), Stalin commenced his drive against Zinoviev and Kamenev at the end of 1925.
In 1926, alarmed at the turn of events, and under pressure of the revolutionary Leningrad proletariat, Zinoviev and Kamenev came over to the Left Opposition, acknowledging that the “Trotskyists” had been right on all fundamental questions. They were joined in this step by a large group of Bolsheviks. A united opposition was formed on the basis of the “Platform of the Opposition” to which we shall have occasion to refer later. It was in this period that Zinoviev stated that fighting Trotsky had been the “greatest mistake of his life.” He also admitted that the legend of “Trotskyism” had been invented as an instrument in the struggle for power. Krupskaya who had also joined the Opposition in 1926, declared “Were Lenin alive, he would most assuredly be in a G.P.U. prison”.
There was an accretion of strength of the Opposition. After the coming over of Zinoviev, practically the whole of the Leningrad party organisation supported the Oppo-sition. But the party bureaucracy, now possessed of great power was solidly for Stalin. The kulak traders, who had grown at an alarming rate, between 1924 and 1927, were all, naturally, supporters of Stalin against the Opposition. Utilising all the forces of the party and the state at his disposal Stalin set out to smash the Oppo-sition. The entire Leningrad Committee was arbitrarily displaced. The Opposition platform was refused publica-tion as an anti-party document. Imprisonment and exile followed for infringing party discipline. Every kind of pressure was brought to bear on Oppositionists by the bureaucratic machine. In the 1927 demonstration in Mos-cow and other large towns on the anniversary of the October revolution, Oppositionists who marched with the slogan “Fulfil the Testament of Lenin” were set upon and dispersed by specially selected troops. Trotsky was fired on in the street. Oppositionists meetings were broken up by gangs organised by party committees.
In November 1927 the Oppositionists were expelled from the party. In December the 15th Congress ratified the action of the leadership. Trotsky and many other leaders were exiled. Zinoviev and Kamenev capitulated, were par-doned, and re-commenced their denunciations of “Trotsky-ism.” The terror fell on the worker Oppositionists, driving them underground. By 1929 there were 5,000 Oppositionists in prison. The Bolshevik party of Lenin was no more.[4]
SOCIALISM IN A SINGLE COUNTRY
The rise of the bureaucracy usurping the party and the masses was reflected quite early in the theoretical field by the appearance of the theory of Socialism in a single country.
The very idea that socialism could be established in a single country is alien to the literature of revolutionary Marxism as well as to the entire history of Bolshevism. The Bolsheviks of course recognised the possibility of a seizure of power by the proletariat in a single country, while capitalist rule still remains undefeated in the others. From April 1917 they worked for such a seizure of power in Russia and in October took the lead in its achievement. But they never confused the “dictatorship of the prole-tariat” with the “establishment of Socialism”. They never maintained that it was possible to build socialism in Russia, except through the international revolution. The de-pendence of the revolution in Russia on the international revolution was frankly acknowledged by all the leaders of the Bolshevik Party in their writings and speeches both in the days of the October insurrection and afterwards.
Of the numerous statements of Lenin on this subject it is necessary only to quote the following written in March 1922 in order to make clear his views. “We have not completed even the foundation of socialist economy. This can still be taken away by the hostile forces of a dying capi-talism. We must be clearly aware of this and openly acknowledge it …There is absolutely nothing terrible, nothing offering a legitimate cause for the slightest dis-couragement, in recognising this bitter truth; for we have always taught and repeated this elementary truth of Marxism, that for the victory of Socialism the combined efforts of the workers of several advanced countries are necessary”—(“On Ascending a High Mountain”. Lenin Selected Works , Vol. 10. Pages 308-9).
Meanwhile, the programme of the Communist Youth in 1921 (ratified by the Politbureau including Lenin, Trotsky and. Stalin) states “Russia although possessing enormous na-tural resources, is nevertheless in the matter of industry a backward country, in which a petty bourgeois population predominates. It can come to Socialism only through the Socialist world revolution.”
In April 1924, in his “Problems of Leninism” Stalin himself echoed this idea of Lenin. “Can we succeed and secure the definitive victory of Socialism in one country without the combined efforts of the proletarians of several advanced countries? Most certainly not. The efforts of a single country are enough to overthrow the bourgeoisie; this is what the history of our revolution proves. But for the definitive triumph of Socialism, the organisation of Socialist production, the efforts of one country alone are not enough particularly of an essentially rural country like Russia; the efforts of the proletarians of several advanced countries are needed.”
But in October 1924, less than a year after the death of Lenin, Stalin for the first time in the history of Bolshevism invented the theory that Socialism was possible in a single country. In April 1925 the theory was made party policy. Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Lenin’s widow Krupskaya and a host of other old Bolshevik leaders opposed this deviation from Marxism. The Opposition pointed out in vain that this error would serve as the starting point for leading the party away from Marxism and the goal of inter-national revolution. Party Members held up their hands and voted for this anti-Marxian reactionary theory as the policy of Lenin. Bureaucratic control of the party had strangled it. Internationalism, the corner-stone of Bolshevism, was swept away. It was henceforth to exist only as a facade.
If the defeat and expulsion of the Opposition represented the organisational triumph of the bureaucracy, the theory of Socialism in one country represented its ideological triumph. It became for the bureaucracy the ideological expression of its nationally confined interests. For, if Russia could build socialism by herself, then the world revolution became not a matter of necessity but of bene-volent sentiment. Henceforth the main business of the Comintern would be not revolution but the “defence of the U.S.S.R.” The theory of Socialism in one country clear-ed the way Fur the abandonment of the aim of world revolution by the Comintern, and its substitution by the policy of securing the defence of the U.S.S.R. by the Red Army and pacts with capitalist governments. The fate of the Communist International as a revolutionary organisation was sealed. With the triumph of the bureaucracy in 1928 it was transformed into an instrument for serving the day to day foreign policy of the Soviet bureaucracy in callous disregard of the needs of the international working class movement. By that same token, the real defence of the Soviet Union, which depends on international revolution, was sacrificed.
[1] There are few million such functionaries today. Their number is greater than the number of workers at the time of the October revolution.
[2] It was in fact Trotsky who first saw the necessity of changes in War Communism. He made a proposal in 1920 to have a graduated tax on the peasants instead of requisition and to provide them with cheaper industrial goods. The Central Committee at the time, however, rejected the proposal.
[3] Since the very existence of the Testament has been denied by Stalinists on various occasions where the situation permits them to do so, it may not be superfluous to add that if further verification is desired, the inquiring reader can refer to the article “The Right Deviation in the CPSU” appearing in Vol. 2 of “Leninism” by Stalin himself. Here Stalin uses a quotation from Lenin’s letter to discredit Bukharin’s abilities as a theoretician when he had no longer need of his services. Reference can also be found to the Testament in a speech by Stalin appearing in International Press Correspondence  of November 17, 1927.
[4] In the 7 years between the February revolution of 1917 and the death of Lenin (Jan. 1924) the Bolshevik party held 8 regular party congresses and 7 conferences. The 15th Congress of December 1927 was held after a lapse of two years after the 14th Congress. The 16th Congress was held 2  years later. Between the 16th and 17th Congresses (Jan. 1934) nearly 4 years were allowed to lapse. The same practice, as we shall see, was applied to the Congresses of the International.

Leslie Goonewardene
Rise And Fall Of The Comintern
The Degeneration Of The Soviet Union
Chapter Ten
THE RETREAT
In the Soviet Union, despite Stalin’s bombastic claim that Russia has attained Socialism, economic realities have forced a retreat. Russian industry was incapable of providing the machinery and equipment necessary for making collectivised agriculture an economic proposition. 90% of the peasant farms were collectivised. But decree after decree had later to be promulgated, with the purpose of pacifying the peasants. Increasingly, concessions had to be made to the proprietary and individualistic tendencies in the village. Land of collective farms has been transferred to collectives in perpetuity. The collec-tive farmer has his own plot of land, that is his own little farm with its own livestock, the produce of which he sells in the market. Inequalities in the village, instead of decreasing, have been growing since 1934. And this is in-evitable so long as the level of agricultural technique re-mains low. For despite all Stalin’s efforts to introduce Socialism by law, economic forces will break through those laws. As Marx pointed out in 1875, “Law can never be higher than the economic structure and the cultural development of society conditioned by that structure.”
But far more important than the differentiation taking place within  the collectives is the differentiation taking place as between  the collectives. A minority of collectives, thanks to superiority of soil and location, the prices paid for their products, etc., have prospered at the expense of the remainder. These collectives have bought better equipment, increased their production still further, invest-ed in state loans on interest, and have raised the level of well-being of their members immeasurably above that of the mass of collective farmers and industrial workers.
In the cities, the differentiation of wages among workers has proceeded apace until it has assumed gigantic propor-tions. The Stakhanovist worker often earns twenty to thirty times, and the higher specialist even eighty to a hundred times as much as the unskilled worker. Differ-ences in income, based upon varying skill, intensity etc., one would expect in the Soviet Union which is still in the transitional stage between capitalism and socialism; but not the enormous disparities that exist. It is clear that the existing differences in income result not only from differences in individual productivity, but in fact much more from the appropriation by a minority of the products of the labour of the majority. A privileged section is living at the expense of the majority.
Who constitute this privileged section? The executive members and officials of the Soviets, officials of the party, trade unions and Communist Youth, the commanding staffs of the armed forces, the agents of the G.P.U. the directors and vice-directors of industrial enterprises; the whole administrative and technical personnel of industry down to the foremen, the presidents and party organisers of 250,000 collective farms and of the state farms and tractor stations, the leaders of the trade departments and co-operatives, numbering 5 to 6 million, constitute the most parasitic group in the privileged section of Soviet society. This is the bureaucracy, which is the ruling caste in the Soviet Union. This bureaucracy, together with an equal number composed of the members of the âwell-off’ collec-tives, the Stakhanovists, and their relatives, constitute the privileged section of Soviet society. Together with their wives and families they would in all number over 20 mil-lion, i.e., 12 to 15% of the population. This is the social basis of the commanding upper circles of the bureaucracy which number probably as much as half a million.
The reaction has permeated every sphere of social life. The October revolution emancipated woman. But today abortion has been prohibited and divorces made difficult except for the bureaucracy. Youth has suffered, as every-one else, from the reaction. The 5 million Comsomols (the Communists organisation for youths from 14 to 23 years) have been forbidden to take any part in politics. The arts and sciences have been stunted by the bureaucratic straitjacket. For all writers must conform to every zig-zag in the party line for fear of reprisals. History has been altered and re-written over and over again to suit the requirements of the ruling faction, and of Stalin in particu-lar. The place of literary creations of beauty is taken by panegyrics to the all-powerful leader. Artists, stage directors, and even opera singers fall into disgrace over-night at a word or even a suggestion from above. Since 1935 there has been a marked tendency to revive and recreate the heroes of Czarist times. There has been an open fostering of nationalist ideology. For, having abandoned the revolutionary traditions of October, the bankrupt bureaucracy feels the need for nationalist fetishes by which to bind the masses.
The cult of the leader has developed to such an extent that it has reached fantastic proportions. Stalin has been ele-vated to the position of a virtual deity. The following is an extract from a speech made at the 17th Congress of Soviets, published in Pravda  of February 1st, 1935, with a note of approval by Molotov, “Our love, our devotion, our strength, our heroism, our life—all these are thine, great Stalin Here take them, all this is thine, chief of the great father-land! Men of all time and of all nations shall call by thy name all that is beautiful, strong, wise and pretty …When my beloved will bear me my child, the first word I shall teach him will be—STALIN!” (See C.L.R. James World Revolution ). That a speech of such a level could have been made at a Congress of Soviets is itself a measure of the extent of degeneration that has taken place in the Soviet Union.
As Trotsky says, “No army can be more democratic than the regime which nourishes it”. And “The army is a copy of society and suffers from all its diseases, usually at a higher temperature”. The Stalinist bureaucracy has introduced officers’ ranks resplendent with bourgeois titles in the Red Army, which had all been abolished by the October revo-lution. An officers’ hierarchy with special privileges has been created, which is now separated from the rank and file and is instead bound closer together with ruling bureau-cratic circles.
A POLITICAL COUNTER-REVOLUTION
The Soviets, the party, and the trade unions had been the instruments through which the proletariat exercised politi-cal power and guaranteed the stability of the proletarian dictatorship. But all these have become today the instruments not of the workers but of the bureaucracy. The Soviets had long since lost their democratic character as organisations in which the masses actively participated and intervened. But even these bureaucratised soviets have been liquidated under the New Constitution, introduced in 1937. Workers’ and Soldiers’ Soviets exist no longer, and the workers are dissolved in the general mass of the population. In the soviet constitution adopted after the revolution, the vote of a single worker received the same representation as those of five peasants, thus guaranteeing organisationally what was already guaranteed by the rela-tion of class forces, namely, the dictatorship of the proletariat. But in the New Constitution, which declares that Socialism has been achieved and classes abolished, the worker’s vote counts no more than that of a collectivised peasant. Thus the reactionary bureaucracy is relying upon the country in its struggle against the city. The New Constitution, far from being “the most democratic in the world”, as Stalin boasted, is a cruel farce. It suffices to point out that there can be no democratic significance in an election in which there is but one candidate to choose from, and he, too, nominated by the bureaucratic apparatus.
After the revolution, the trade unions became an instrument of the workers for guaranteeing workers’ democracy and protecting workers’ interests. Lenin had pointed out in the famous discussion on the trade union question in 1920, that the trade unions were a necessary weapon for the defence of the workers from their own workers’ state itself, which state, moreover, was a workers’ state with “bureaucratic deformations”. But the Stalinist bureau-cracy has taken away from the trade unions the right they enjoyed to intervene in questions of employment and dis-missals of workers, and of management of the factory in general. Unlimited and uncontrolled powers have been given to the factory directors imposed from above. There has ceased to exist any kind of workers’ control within the factory. Nor have the workers control over the trade union bureaucrats, who are appointed and removed from above. The party is the main instrument though which the pro-letariat exercises its political power in a workers’ state. But for this the party itself must have a free and rich inner life. But by repeated purges, the liquidation of all opposition, in short, by the destruction of every vestige of internal democracy, the bureaucracy converted the party into its docile instrument. Since 1929 the G.P.U. has played an ever-growing role in the internal life of the party. Not only expulsions, but imprisonment, exile, torture, death and punishment of relatives have become commonplace occurrences to stifle all opposition. Party Congresses, held more and more infrequently, are merely stage-managed affairs in which the policy already decided upon by the Politburo is carried unanimously with (too much!) acclamation. The Politburo is always right, with one exception, that is, it cannot be right as against Stalin, who is infallible. By strangling the Bolshevik Party, bureaucratising the trade unions and soviets, and now by even liquidating the latter the bureaucracy has completely expropriated the workers of political power. In short, it has carried through a political counter-revolution .
THE TERROR AND BONAPARTISM
In order to secure its own position, the bureaucracy has found it necessary to exterminate the entire Bolshevik Old Guard and so free itself from all the encumbering traditions that still bound it to the October revolution. For example, of the thirty-one members and alternates, of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party at the time of the revolution of October 1917, only Stalin, and Alexandra Kollontai are alive. A few died natural deaths, but the majority have been murdered. Ex--Mensheviks, hitherto unknown mediocrities, and even active counter-revolutionaries of the civil war period (like Maisky) have taken the places of the Bolshevik Old Guard of the revolution. The gigantic frame-ups of the Moscow Trials of 1936-37 with their charges unproved by any evidence, with the fantastic confessions of revolutionists (like Zinoviev and Kamenev) of decades of revolutionary service declaring that they had plotted to re-introduce capitalism in the Soviet Union (!), were staged, if inefficiently, at the command of Stalin, to serve more than one purpose. Stalin did not fear individuals like Zinoviev and Kamenev, who had by their abject recantations in the past repeatedly proved their subservience to him, but he feared the traditions and ideology of the revolution, which they symbolised. Secondly, by getting the accused to confess to fictitious connections with the exiled Trotsky, he was dealing a blow at the enemy he really feared, namely, the Left Opposition, driven deep underground, but representing none the less the only point around which the workers must rally in a revolt against the bureaucracy. Also, the trial, with the publicity it received throughout the country, was meant to terrorise completely not only all oppositionists, but all critics even, and this time not merely by expulsion, im-prisonment or exile, but by the firing squad. Finally, by the liquidation of the whole stratum of tried revolutionists who had led the Russian revolution side by side with Lenin, Stalin no doubt hoped to further his reconciliation with bourgeoisie of the “democratic” imperialisms with whom he was now feverishly striving to enter into a “Peace Alliance” against the Axis powers.
The terror has proceeded apace in the Soviet Union. In 1935 the death penalty was instituted for children from 12 years of age upwards. In May 1947 the death penalty in peace-time was abolished and 25 years imprisonment in labour camps substituted. Despite the fact that mass purges had taken place before, at the end of 1935 and in the first half of 1936, hundreds of thousands of party members were again expelled, the most active of them being thrown into prisons and concentration camps. The Army has not escaped the terror. In June 1937 Marshal Tukhachevsky and 7 Generals were tried in secret without witnesses or defence and executed within forty-eight hours. In 1938, 80 members of the Council of War constituted in 1934, 18 generals, and thousands of other officers and men were shot or imprisoned.
The above are only some of the more prominent instances that have seen the light of day. In the Moscow Trials, apparently only those who “confessed” were brought to trial. How many refused to “confess”, how many have been shot without trial, how many imprisoned and sent to concentration camps, no one knows. Needless to add, the hysteria of bureaucratic hatred has vented itself with the most ferocity on members belonging to, or suspected of belonging to, the Left Opposition.
The parasitic Soviet bureaucracy, consuming an entirely disproportionate share of the national income, incapable of utilising the active and willing co-operation of the masses, substituting its own bureaucratic mediocrity and inefficiency for mass initiative, and driven further and further along the road of guarding its own power and privileged position as against the masses, has come increasingly in contradic-tion with the necessities of development. It is consequent-ly compelled, on the one hand, to resort to ever more violent methods of repression against the masses whom it dreads, and on the other hand to find scapegoats among its own number on whom to fix the blame for its own inefficiency and mistakes. The ruling Stalinist faction performs this task for the bureaucracy.
In the interests of its own self-preservation the bureau-cracy has been compelled to raise the Stalinist faction even above itself, and, still further, openly to proclaim the Bonapartist principle of an infallible leader. “The increasingly insistent deification of Stalin, is, with all its elements of caricature, a necessary element of the regime. The bureau-cracy has need of an inviolable super arbiter, a first consul if not an emperor, and it raises upon it shoulders him who best responds to its claim for lordship … Each one of them at his post is thinking: L’etat—c’est moi . In Stalin each one easily finds himself. But Stalin also finds in each one a small part of his own spirit. Stalin is the personification of the bureaucracy". (Trotsky, Revolution Betrayed , page 262.)
A DEGENERATE WORKERS’ STATE
The Soviet bureaucracy has completely expropriated the workers of political power; it consumes an enormous share of the national income; it permits no control whatsoever over its actions and its income; it has become the sole commanding and privileged stratum in Soviet society. But it would be a serious error to conclude that it has become a new ruling class. A ruling economic class is based on a particular system of property relations. The property relations established by the October revolu-tions still remains, namely, state ownership in the decisive spheres of the economy and the monopoly of foreign trade. “As a conscious political force the bureaucracy has be-trayed the revolution. But a victorious revolution is fortunately not only a programme and a banner, not only political institutions, but also a system of social relations. To betray it is not enough. You have to overthrow it. The October revolution has been betrayed by the ruling stratum, but not yet overthrown. It has a great power of resilience, coinciding with the established property relations, with the living force of the proletariat, the con-sciousness of its best elements, the impasse of world capital-ism, and the inevitability of world revolution”. (Trotsky, Revolution Betrayed , page 238.)
The aim of the bureaucracy is to defend its own power and privileged position. But, precisely in order to do this, it is compelled, albeit bureaucratically and inefficiently, to defend statified property as the source of its power and its income. Thus the bureaucracy plays a dual role. The progressive aspect of its work merits the support of the international proletariat, which should not, however, be blind to its reactionary general role. Thus the rule of the bureau-cracy reflects in a distorted form the dictatorship of the proletariat. These considerations enable us to define the bureaucracy not as a ruling class but as a ruling caste, and the Soviet Union as a degenerate workers’ state .
The absolute pre-requisite of the regeneration of the workers’ state is the overthrow of the corrupt and parasitic bureaucracy. But this can only be done by violence, that is to say, by a revolution. But what is called for is not a social but a political revolution. The proletariat would have to institute soviet democracy in place of the bureau-cratic aristocracy. For the Soviet Union this means, among other things, a revival of freedom of Soviet parties beginning with the new Bolshevik party, a revival of the trade unions, a radical revision of economic planning in the interests of the masses, the abolition of ranks and decora-tions, the freedom of criticism, the release of science and art from their shackles, and last but not least, a mooring once again of Soviet foreign policy to the anchor of revolu-tionary internationalism.
It may pertinently be asked, why has the political revolu-tion not yet occurred, or at least why have there been no visible signs of its approach? Trotsky answers this question: “The vast majority of the Soviet workers are even now hostile to the bureaucracy. The peasant masses hate them with their healthy plebeian hatred. If in contrast to the peasants the workers have almost never come out on the road of open struggle, thus condemning the protesting villages to confusion and impotence, this is not only because of the repression. The workers fear lest, in throw-ing out the bureaucracy, they will open the way for a capitalist restoration … The workers are realists. Without deceiving themselves with regard to the ruling caste—at least with regard to its lower tiers which stand near to them—they see in it the watchman for the time being of certain part of their own conquests. They will inevitably drive out the dishonest, impudent and unreliable watch-man as soon as they see another possibility. For this it is necessary that in the West or in the East another revolu-tionary dawn arise”. (Revolution Betrayed , page 269.)
“The first victory of a revolution in Europe would pass like an electric shock through the Soviet masses, straighten them up, raise their spirit of independence, awaken the traditions of 1905 and 1917, undermine the position of the Bonapartist bureaucracy, and acquire for the Fourth International no less significance than the October revolu-tion possessed for the Third. Only in that way can the first workers’ state be saved for the socialist future”. (Ibid , page 274.)
The Stalinist bureaucracy knows full well that the inter-national revolution reviving revolutionary traditions and bringing to life and strength forces now dormant in the Soviet Union, would spell its own doom. In turning its back on international revolution the Stalinist bureaucracy was only acting in self-preservation. In no circumstances can it adopt a revolutionary policy in regard to any coun-try, even a country with which it is at war. This is well illustrated by the fact that during the war it did not stand for proletarian revolution in Germany, but only for the overthrow of Hitler. In an “Order of the Day” dated February 23, 1942, Stalin declared: “History teaches us that Hitlers come and go, but that the German people, the German state remains”. It was no part of the plans of the Stalinist bureaucracy to overthrow the German capita-list state. On the contrary its plans were to crush the masses if they attempted a revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system in Germany. This is made quite clear in the statement of Ilya Ehrenberg, Stalin’s chief war-time publicist, made to the Christian Science Monitor  and published in the 7th August 1944 issue of that journal. Asked what the Russians would do in the event of a revolt in Germany which would “overthrow Hitler and welcome the advancing Red Army with appropriate banners”, he replied: “These would be the first people we would shoot”! The occasion for such an eventuality did not develop in Germany. But in the countries of Eastern Europe, one after another, the advancing Red Armies crushed the re-volutionary upsurges of the masses. The Stalinist bureaucracy, which hates and dreads the international revolution, has no alternative in the face of revolutionary risings of the masses but to tread the path of counter-revolution.

Chapter Eight
SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY AND THE 7TH CONGRESS
The victory of Hitler in Germany led to a decisive change in the orientation of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union. Hitherto, in the West, it has been Anglo-French intervention that Stalin had feared. With the advent of Hitler to power and the resulting threat to Anglo-French imperialism, this particular danger receded at least temporarily, into the background. But in its place there arose the more formidable and more imminent danger of German intervention itself. The fulminations of Hitler against Communism and his open threats against the Soviet Union only emphasised the danger.
What counter measures did Stalin take? In September 1934 Russia joined the League of Nations. In May 1935 the Franco-Soviet Pact—a military alliance was signed in which each party promised to come to the aid of the other in the event of German aggression. In the same month Stalin declared to the French Premier Laval that he “understood and approved completely the policy of National Defence of France”. Though constituting a temporary check to Hitler, the Franco-Soviet Pact was of little value, since the military intervention of France against Germany was subject to the approval of Great Britain. Stalin therefore aimed at an Anglo-Franco-Soviet pact to achieve his purpose. The formation of the Rome-Berlin Axis in 1936 and of the Anti-Comintern Pact of Germany, Italy and Japan soon after, made Stalin redouble his efforts to secure an alliance of the “democratic” countries with Russia against the fascist countries.
No one can question the right of the Soviet Union to take advantage of divisions among the imperialist nations and to conclude even military pacts for the purpose of its own defence. But it is short-sighted folly to imagine that pacts with capitalist governments can serve as a reliable basis for securing the defence of the Soviet Union. It is sheer chicanery to deceive the workers of the world into believing that the class character and policies of a capitalist state alters one whit by the fact that its government is prepared, for its own imperialist purposes, to make an alliance with the Soviet Union. And above all, it is base treachery to subordinate the needs of the international movement to the interests of Soviet foreign policy. But this is precisely what the degenerated Comintern did, in callous and blatant fashion, in the decade that has followed the victory of fascism in Germany. Having long since abandoned faith in world revolution, the Soviet bureaucrats saw in the Comintern only an instrument for securing support for their foreign policies, and did not hesitate to use it to âplacate’ the bourgeoisie of the “democratic” countries.
The Seventh World Congress of the 3rd International, meeting in August 1935 after a lapse of seven years, officially set the party on the new line. The world was divided into peace-loving democratic capitalisms like Britain, France, and Czechoslovakia (with whom Russia desired alliance), and war-loving capitalisms like Germany and Japan (who constituted a war threat to Russia). The victory of Socialism in the Soviet Union was declared to have been finally and irrevocably achieved. But the most infamous of all was the new tactic of the Popular Front which was prescribed as the method of defeating fascism.
We have stated earlier that the rise of fascism is the inevitable consequence of the inability of the bourgeoisie to maintain its class rule through bourgeois parliamentarism in conditions of capitalist decline. In other words the growth of the fascist danger in a particular country means that bourgeois-democracy has become incompatible with the existence of bourgeois class rule. Henceforth in that country only one of two solutions is possible. Either the proletarian revolution which overthrows the class rule of the bourgeoisie and substitutes thereof the class rule of the proletariat, or the fascist reaction which gives another lease of life to capitalism. The former alternative demands the formation of a united front of the working class against fascism as the first step in the struggle for the overthrow of capitalism. This means in practice a united front of the revolutionary party with other working class parties (notably the Social Democrats).
The tactic of the united front consists in an agreement for joint action between different parties and organisations having different programmes. A correct application of this tactic demands that the revolutionary party does not give up its own programme for a common political programme with other parties; that it preserves its full independence and that it reserves the right to criticise its allies. Such a united front between the revolutionary party and other working class parties, coupled with a bold and resolute leadership that will not hesitate to break openly when necessary, with the vacillating Social Democratic allies in order to carry the working class forward to the final assault, is the only way to defeat fascism. In Germany basing itself on Soviet Union foreign policy considerations, the Comintern rejected the path of a united front of the working class parties and condemned the German working class to the penal servitude of fascism. Now, corresponding to the demand of Soviet foreign policy, it advocated the policy of class collaboration disguised under the specious term of Popular Front.
Fascism was declared to be the “open terrorist dictatorship not of finance capital, but only of the most reactionary, most chauvinistic and most imperialist elements of finance capital”.[1] From this was deduced the Popular Front policy of winning over the liberal bourgeois elements. The means proposed to defeat fascism was therefore not only an alliance with the Social Democrats but also with their masters, the liberal bourgeoisie; not united action of the working class for carrying the class struggle forward to revolution, but abandonment of the proletarian programme in favour of a common political programme with the liberals to maintain the tottering bourgeois democracy.
The âobedient fools’ saw what was required of them. The struggle for the overthrow of capitalism was replaced by the struggle to maintain bourgeois democracy, where necessary, against the proletarian vanguard. The tirades against the fascists of one’s own country were extended to tirades against German Fascism. For, says Dimitrov, “The most reactionary variety of Fascism is the German type   of fascism ... German fascism is acting as the spearhead of international counter-revolution, as the chief incendiary of imperialist war, as the initiator of a crusade against the Soviet Union.” (Ibid  .)
In country after country of the democracies, the Stalinists demanded, in exchange for their willingness to defend the fatherland, only one price from the bourgeoisie. That is, that the foreign policy of the particular country should not be directed against the Soviet Union, They were prepared to “suspend” the class struggle at home and transform themselves into the recruiting sergeants of the imperialists for the coming Imperialist World War. The Sixth World Congress of 1928 meeting after the expulsion of the Opposition, had signified the transformation of the Comintern from a revolutionary organisation into an instrument of the Soviet bureaucracy. Internationalism, however, continued to exist for it, if only as a facade. But even this facade had now become an obstruction in the path of the bureaucrats, and had therefore to be dispensed with. The Seventh World Congress accomplished this task and signified the break with the last remnants of Comintern traditions.
THE ROLE OF THE POPULAR FRONT IN FRANCE
The world economic depression which commenced in 1919 reached France late. It was from 1932 onwards that France began to feel the full effects of the crisis. And following the crisis there began to appear in France precisely that process that had proceeded apace in Germany from 1929 onwards and, had ended in the victory of Hitler. Fascism began to rear its head. Slowly, but none the less surely, the nation commenced to divide into two camps, the masses beginning to move either to the Right—to the Fascists, or to the Left—to the Socialists and Communists.
On February 6, 1934, gangs of fascists staged an unsuccessful attack on the Chamber of Deputies in an attempt not merely to drive out the Radical Government of Daladier that was in office at the time, but to break the parliament altogether. The Stalinists, still following the ultra-leftist line of Social Fascism, at first supported the Fascists, demanding the arrest of Daladier for shooting the fascists (!), but were soon compelled by the situation itself to alter their course. On the 12th there occurred a vast general strike of protest by the workers called by the Socialists and Communists, which showed that the workers were alive to the danger. This constituted a set-back to the fascists. But the Communist Party soon turned back to the official line of Social Fascism. In the middle of the year a “united front” was indeed formed between the Socialists and Communists, but the proviso, that there should be no criticism by the two parties of each other was included in the terms, on the suggestion of the Communists! But after the Franco-Soviet Pact of September, a special drive was made to rope in the Radicals too. By the middle of 1935, the Popular Front of the Communist, Socialist and Radical Socialist Parties had come into being.
The Radical Socialist Party was pre-eminently the party of the petty bourgeoisie, with a leadership completely subservient to the bourgeoisie. But it was the most profound mistake to suppose that by winning over the Radical leaders one could win over their petty bourgeois following. We have pointed out earlier that in the advanced countries, fascism finds it necessary to utilise the petty bourgeoisie in order to come into power. The decomposition of the centre parties of the vacillating petty bourgeoisie of town and country is, consequently, generally the first sign of the advent of the fascist danger. So long as capitalism had been able to grant certain sops to the petty bourgeoisie, Radicalism in France had been able to maintain its hold over the petty bourgeois masses. But after the crisis it became clear that even such sops were now out of question. The petty bourgeois masses began to cease to believe in the possibility of ordered progress under bourgeois democracy. It is precisely in these conditions that they fall an easy prey to fascism. In France the petty bourgeoisie, no longer satisfied with the democratic shibboleths of the Radicals, were increasingly looking elsewhere for a solution of their problems, and were beginning to turn to the fascist organisations, the Jeunesses, Patriots, the Croix-de-Feu, the Solidarite Francaise, etc. The problem of winning the petty bourgeois masses to the side of the fight against fascism was none other than the problem of winning them away from the Radical Party. A bold and independent class policy on the part of the proletarian parties, secured on the basis of a united front, would certainly have broken away the bulk of the lower strata of the petty bourgeoisie from the historically exhausted Radical shell, and prepared the way for the next stage, the proletarian seizure of power. But the Popular Front with the Radicals, adopting the Radical programme of the defence of democracy, served only to bolster up artificially the disintegrating Radical Party, thanks to the prestige that association with the working class parties gave it. The Popular Front meant the utilisation of the on-coming mass wave only to reinforce and to reimpose on the masses their democratic illusions, until such time as, cruelly deceived again, they would turn in desperation to the Fascists.
Determined to fight Fascism, the French workers, trusting the Communist Party, increasingly joined its ranks swelling its membership to 150,000 in the middle of 1936 (excluding 100,000 members of the Young Communist League). The elections in the middle of 1936 resulted in an overwhelming victory for the Popular Front. Immediately after the elections, there occurred in June a vast general strike throughout France, involving 6 million workers and employees of all kinds. The workers gaining new confidence from the election results, but at the same time instinctively sensing that independent action on their part was necessary if only to “push on” their leaders, entered the factories and refused to come out till their demands were satisfied. In many factories the managers were imprisoned as hostages. The “stay in” strikes constituted a threat to the foundations of the bourgeois order, for they constituted a virtual occupation of the factories of the capitalists.
The situation was pregnant with tremendous possibilities. On the slogans of “Disarm the Fascists” and “Form Armed Workers’ Defence Guards” the workers could themselves have disarmed the armed Fascist bands, and with the arms seized from them formed the first detachments of a regular workers’ militia. From then on to the formation of Soviets would have been but a step. The Communist Party was in a position thus to carry forward the movement to revolution. All France knew its leaders, the party had a real following among the industrial workers, it had considerable influence in the trade unions, and in the developing situation an ever-increasing number of workers were looking to it for leadership. But far from carrying the movement forward, the C.P. of France was, together with the Social Democrats, responsible for stemming the strike wave. Concerned no longer with revolution, but rather dreading it, together with the Socialists they led the workers back to work in the interests of maintaining the Popular Front Government and the good relations of the Soviet Union with capitalist France.
The Popular Front Government of the Socialist Premier Blum hastily passed bills through parliament, granting several concessions to the workers, notably the 40 hour week, holidays with pay, and provisions for increased wages. Needless to add, with the inevitable ebb in the mass movement that followed in the course of time, these economic concessions were wrung back one by one, by the capitalists, directly as well as in an indirect manner through the increased cost of living resulting from devaluation and other inflationary measures which the Government was forced by the pressure of the banks to carry out. The 40 hour week, the last of the gains, was abrogated in 1938.
Only the International Workers’ Party (POI), the French section of the Fourth International, raised the slogan of Soviets in the critical days of the general strike, and attempted to develop the movement towards the revolution. They were, of course, immediately subjected to the united attack of the Stalinists, Socialists and the bourgeoisie. Few in numbers, and unknown as yet to the majority of the workers, they were not in a position to influence the course of events.
The mass movement, though stemmed, was yet far from defeated. All eyes were soon centered on Spain, where the Spanish revolution had begun following on the armed revolt of the Fascists. The Spanish workers and peasants had the active sympathy of the overwhelming majority of the workers in France. The policy of non-intervention agreed on between the governments of France, Britain and the Soviet Union, wherein it was agreed not to supply arms to either side in the Spanish civil war, incurred the greatest disfavour among the masses. Here again was an opportunity for the C.P. of France. If it had given the call, it was entirely possible for the French workers themselves to have transported arms across the frontier into Spain, in spite of the orders of the Government. So deep and widespread was their feeling on Spain, that the Blum Government would not have dared to prevent it; and in the alternative if it did, this would immediately have brought about an acute crisis in France. But the C.P. of France confined itself to holding meetings asking the Blum Government to “lift the embargo,” and even this propaganda was carried on with an anxious eye on the Right Radicals, who continually threatened to secede from the Popular Front.
By the end of 1936 the Communists came forward with their new proposal for widening the Popular Front still further into a “French Front,” which in fact meant an alliance of all sections (including the most reactionary bourgeois) against Germany.
The mass movement continued to ebb. The Right began to gain at the expense of the Left. The disappointed petty bourgeois elements began to turn to the Fascists; workers disappointed in the Communists, to the Socialists. In early 1937 Right Wing Radicals took important portfolios in the Blum Ministry. The shift to the Right continued, the Blum Ministry giving place to the Chautemps Ministry, and finally to the Daladier Ministry. The Popular Front was at an end. A huge armaments programme was set in motion, wages reduced and social services cut clown, and the rights of meeting and press restricted. DaIadier declared that attempts to enforce the 40 hour week in the munitions industry would be considered as a crime against the State. The Communist Party supported the armaments programme and became the most active social patriots in France. Its leader Thorez openly joined the French army, a fact which was greeted with acclamation in the Communist press. The stage was being set for the advent of Fascism. If Fascism did not arrive, it was only because of the imminence of the imperialist war demanding “national unity,” which unity was being freely secured by the bourgeoisie, thanks to the treachery of the Communists in particular.
THE POPULAR FRONT COMES TO SPAIN
The experience of Spain is rich in lessons for the international proletariat. But there are two main lessons that stand out above all others. Firstly, Spain proved once again (as it had earlier been proved in Russia and China) that in the present era of declining capitalism, there can be no “peaceful” period of bourgeois-democratic development for backward countries. It proved that a backward country like Spain could accomplish its bourgeois democratic revolution only through the dictatorship of the proletariat, thus bearing out once again the correctness of Trotsky’s theory of permanent revolution. In the second place, the tragic experience of Spain provided the final and conclusive proof of the impotence of the Popular Front as an instrument for defeating Fascism. It testified to the correctness of the analysis of the Left Opposition and the 4th International after it, which pointed out that the only way to defeat Fascism was by the united class action, of the workers, leading to the overthrow of capitalist rule and the proletarian seizure of power.
Only one third of the land in Spain was owned by the peasants, the majority of whom performed day labour on the big estates to eke out an existence. The rapid growth of agricultural workers’ unions and peasants’ organisations since 1931 under the republic struck deep at the interests of landed capitalism in Spain. The ascendancy of the workers’ organisations created the same problem for the capitalists in the cities. The city capitalists and the landlords were closely bound to one another not only by family ties but also through mortgages. To solve the problems of the capitalists by dividing the land, creating a prosperous peasant proprietor class and thus expanding the internal market, was therefore out of question. Nor could Spanish capitalism expand externally. On account of its belated development it found all these avenues closed to it by the great imperialist powers. Consequently, the Spanish bourgeoisie, in alliance with their partners, the landlords, were compelled to turn to Fascism with its destruction of all independent organisations of the workers, in order to solve their problems.
Ever since the flight of Alfonso in 1931 and the institution of the republican regime, the increasing sharpness of political relations and the widening chasm between Right and Left into which the nation was being divided, provided evidence that the republic could only be of short duration before it was swept away by one or other of the gathering class forces. All this, however, was perceived and foretold only by Trotsky and the Left Opposition. The 1934 rising of the Asturian miners on the one hand, and its brutal suppression accompanied by the imprisonment of thirty thousand workers and their leaders on the other, were unmistakable signs of the approaching storm.
The majority of workers in Spain followed the Anarchists (FAI—Anarchist Federation of Spain) with their trade union organisation, the CNT (National Confederation of Labour). They represented the school of Bakunin who broke away from the First International of Marx. A petty bourgeois deviation from Marxism, Anarchism had taken root in countries where capitalism had developed late and the working class was young, and reflected the ideology that the masses of ruined handicraftsmen, thrown into the working class, had brought with them into the workers’ movement. The Anarchists were exceedingly militant in carrying on the day to day struggles of the workers, but they believed that the emancipation of the working class could be secured by universal strike action and the assumption of control by the workers in each factory. Opponents of government or coercion of any kind from above, they were opposed to the Marxian concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and declared “libertarian communism” to be their immediate aim. Purists in this field, they eschewed participation in elections or use of parliaments, declaring that these things had only a corrupting influence on the movement. When the theoretical edifices of Anarchism crumbled one by one in face of the hard realities of the revolutionary struggle in Spain, the Anarchists, for all their revolutionary phrases, were shown up as contemptible compromisers in practice, in no way superior to their social democratic rivals.
The Socialist Party also had a large following, with its trade union organisation the UGT (General Workers Union). However, even the leader of the left socialists Largo Caballero, though he grumbled and complained, followed the path of coalition with the bourgeoisie, till he was swept away by the reaction he himself had permitted to grow. The POUM (Workers Party of Marxist Unity), though a comparatively small party, had a splendid opportunity of leading the Spanish revolution. But its centrist and vacillating policy precluded it from doing so, although this did not save it, together with the Trotskyists and Left Anarchists, from bearing the full brunt of the Stalinist-bourgeois terror long before the victory of the Fascists. At first opposed to coalition with the bourgeoisie, the POUM suddenly supported the Popular Front in the elections of February 1936. It renounced the coalition after the elections, but called for an authentic Popular Front Government on the eve of the Fascist uprising (July, 17th). And it entered the Catalan Coalition Government in September, supporting by that action all the reactionary acts perpetrated by the government. The small group of Bolshevik-Leninists alone showed a recognition of what the situation demanded of a revolutionary party. But although they made not inconsiderable gains, particularly from among the ranks of the CNT under whose banner the more important sections of the proletariat were gathered, none the less, time is required before the working class can be weaned away from its traditional organisations. But before this could happen reaction had regained its grip while disillusionment and despair had set in among the workers.
The Popular Front in Spain was composed of a bloc of the Socialist and Communist Parties with the liberal bourgeois Republicans, the Catalan Left of Companys and the Basque Nationalists, with the tacit support of the Anarchists, who voted for the Popular Front candidates in the elections of February 16, 1936. These elections resulted in the defeat of the Fascists and a victory for the Popular Front, and a government of the Republican Azana was formed. However, as happened in France four months later, the masses did not wait for the Popular Front Government to fulfil its promises, but went on strike in a vast wave spreading throughout the country. Political prisoners were released by tearing open the jails, and those dismissed after the 1934 revolt were forcibly reinstated in employment by the workers.
The Azana Government did nothing except legalise the measures already carried out by the masses. It did nothing to solve the land problem. It showed no signs of giving up imperialist aims in Spanish Morocco (the only means by which it could have cut the ground under the feet of the Fascist General commanding the Moroccan troops). It did not even make a serious attempt to purge the army of its Fascist officers. As a matter of fact, the Azana Government was aware of the preparations for the impending coup d’etat of the Fascists, but only suppressed the news and lulled the masses into a false sense of security. It is not surprising, therefore, that when the army revolted under the leadership of General Franco on July 17th, 1936, the Government not only suppressed the news at the start and made no effort at resistance, but even attempted to come to a compromise with the Fascist Generals. The Socialist and Communist Parties declared their confidence in the Government. In a joint manifesto of July 18th, they stated “The Government commands and the Popular Front obeys”. If matters had been left to the Government or these worker-allies of the bourgeoisie, the Fascist revolt would surely have succeeded in the very first days. Fortunately, the Spanish proletariat acted.
THE SPANISH REVOLUTION BEGINS
On July 19th the Barcelona proletariat, seizing what arms they could find, stormed the garrisons and prevented the capitulation of the republic to the fascists. Soon all Catalonia, industrially the most highly developed province in Spain, was in their hands. The Madrid proletariat saved Madrid. It was the same in Valencia and Malaga. The workers rose spontaneously to action. Franco’s revolt acted as a spur and enabled the workers to overcome the limitations imposed on them by leaders who had entirely failed to read the signs of the times. The army was almost entirely with the Fascists. The Popular Front Government had practically no armed forces behind them. A new army was required, and the workers’ organisations built their militias, equipped them and sent them to the front. Workers, police and militiamen took over police functions. Sailors shot their officers, elected sailors’ committees, took over the Loyalist fleet and established contact with workers’ committees. The Spanish Revolution had begun!
This process went furthest in Catalonia, where within a week practically all transport and industry was in the hands of workers’ committees, predominantly of the CNT. Here, a period of dual power ensued. Of the numerous committees that sprang up the most important organ of power was the “Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias of Catalonia”, the decrees of which were the only law in Catalonia. In the villages, the peasants seized the land, in many areas forming collectives. The Militias of the “Central Committee” conquered the province of Aragon as an army of social liberation, expropriating the landlords and organising production generally on a collective basis!
The big bourgeoisie were behind Franco from the start. The Republican leaders, representing the bourgeois liberal and professional elements, whose income and position are based on the institutions of bourgeois democracy, had already demonstrated their impotence at the commencement of the fascist revolt. The masses, one the other hand, had shown the way to defeat Fascism. It was precisely where revolutionary means had been adopted that the first important victories had been scored. For the defeat of Fascism it was essential that the fighters in the army should realise that they were fighting for their full social liberation and not for the re-establishment of the old “democratic” forms of exploitation. The workers and peasants in the rear of both armies should be made to realise this. In other words, the fight against fascism could attain victory only as proletarian revolution, giving the land to the peasants and the factories to the workers and leading to the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
The first and most vitally necessary step on this path was to create soviets. The existing organs of workers’ power were scattered in numerous militia and factory committees. The membership of these committees, moreover, was based not on election but on mutual agreement between the various parties. Revolution to go forward needs constantly to draw fresh strength from the masses. For this, a centralised organ of struggle and power is needed, freely elected by the workers (and soldiers), in which the various working class parties can freely contend for leadership of the masses. This need could only be supplied by soviets. The POUM rejected this course. So did the Anarchists, who controlled the already existing committees. Their theories prevented them from using their predominant position in the working class movement to build up the organs of the future workers’ state but did not prevent them from co-operating with the bourgeois state. In other words, in a crisis the Anarchists proved that they were prepared to abandon their false theories in favour not of the proletariat but of the bourgeoisie.
In a situation where a revolutionary upsurge has released powerful mass forces, the reaction finds it necessary to advance at first under cover of parties in which the masses still have faith. In Spain this cover was provided principally by the Communists, Socialists and Anarchists. And of these the Communists were indubitably the most active and conscious agency of the reaction. They stood for subservience to the bourgeosie not only for the period of the war but afterwards as well. Their paper Mundo Obrero  declared, “It is absolutely false that the present workers’ movement has for its object the establishment of a proletarian dictatorship after the war has been terminated. It cannot be said, we have a social motive for our participation in the war. We communists are the first to repudiate this supposition. We are motivated exclusively by a desire to defend the democratic republic” (August 6, 1936). A comparatively small and insignificant party till 1936, due principally to their ultra-leftist policies in the past, the Stalinists expanded swiftly after the Franco revolt. The expansion in their membership, however, was largely from petty bourgeois elements, and their influence was derived principally from the fact that Russia supplied the Spanish Government with arms. The proposals of the C.P. of Spain were always linked with threats that Stalin would stop supplies. When the POUM called for granting Trotsky asylum in Spain, the Soviet Consul General declared to the press “if Trotsky were permitted to enter Catalonia, the Soviet Government would cut off all aid to Spain!” (La Prensa  report—see Morrow, Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Spain ).
In September 1936 was formed the Coalition Government led by the Socialist leader Caballero, consisting of Socialist, Communist and Republican ministers, and joined in November by the Anarchists. This Government proved little better than that of Azana. On the pressing land question it merely sanctioned division of estates belonging to known Fascists. The bourgeois state gradually came back into its own. Decrees were passed dissolving the revolutionary committees of the July days. Several papers of the POUM and CNT were suppressed. The Government Assault Guards were prohibited from taking any part in politics The regular police took back its functions from the worker patrols. The workers were disarmed step by step while the rebuilt police forces were re-armed with Russian material. A centralised army on the bourgeois model gradually took the place of the militias. The persecution of Trotskyists, POUM and Left Anarchists commenced.
Even in the sphere of military operations the Popular Front displayed its inefficiency and impotence. In the early stages of the war the seizure of Algeciras, the principal landing point of Franco’s Moors and legionaires from Spanish North Africa, could easily have been accomplished by the Loyalist navy. But the Government made no attempt to do so. It failed to organise Bilbao and the industrial areas of the North for the production of munitions. This area could have become the chief centre of Spain’s munition supplies. The Aragon Front provided a strategic point from which to strike a crippling blow at Franco’s forces. But this front was starved of arms because it was manned by POUM and Anarchist militias. Clearly, the Popular Front Government feared revolution more than Franco.
THE SABOTAGE OF THE REVOLUTION
The advance of the counter-revolution alarmed the masses. On May 3, 1937, Assault Guards of the Government in Barcelona under the command of a Stalinist, seized the Central Telephone Exchange which the CNT had captured and controlled since July 19th. The workers’ guards on the spot were forcibly disarmed. This action was the last straw to the exasperated workers and led to the second uprising of the Barcelona proletariat. The barricades went up. The Barcelona proletariat rushed to the defence of the CNT-FAI and POUM headquarters. Armed workers in Tarragona and Gerona came out in the same way. The masses of Catalonia were ranged overwhelmingly under the banner of the CNT. This was a splendid opportunity to retrieve the lost position and to go forward. The Fourth Internationalists, as well as the Friends of Durruti and the Libertarian Youth among the Anarchists, put forward the slogan of soviets. But the CNT and POUM leaders gave no lead. Instead, they persuaded the masses to leave the barricades. The result was calamitous. The government lost no time in disarming the workers, and brutal reprisals followed the shameful capitulation.
The Anarchists and Socialists have sought to justify their capitulation in Spain by putting forward the plea that concessions were necessary in order to obtain arms from the Soviet Union. But not only were the Russian supplies meagre, in proportion to the issues at stake in Spain, but there could have been no excuse for yielding to such pressure. In the words of Trotsky, “If the leaders of the Anarchists had resembled revolutionists at all, they would have answered the first blackmail from Moscow not only by continuing he socialist advance but by disclosing Stalin’s counter-revolutionary conditions before the working class of the world. Thus they would have forced the Moscow bureaucracy to choose openly between socialist revolution and the dictatorship of Franco. And what if Moscow, in the absence of People’s Front, should in general refuse to give arms? And what, we answer to this, if the Soviet Union in general did not exist in the world? Revolutions have been victorious up to this time not at all thanks to great foreign patrons who supplied them with arms. Usually the counter-revolution enjoyed foreign patronage ... If at the head of the armed workers and peasants, i.e., at the head of the so-called “republican” Spain there were revolutionists and not cowardly agents of the bourgeoisie, the problem of arming would in general not have played a paramount role. The army of Franco including the colonial Riffs and the soldiers of Mussolini are not at all immune to revolutionary contagion. Surrounded from all sides by the fire of the socialist uprising, the soldiers of Fascism would have proved to be an insignificant quantity. Not arms and not military "geniuses" were lacking in Madrid and Barcelona; what was lacking was a revolutionary party!” (“Conditions for Victory in Spain,” FIGHT , June, 1938.)
Up to the May events, the reaction had developed under cover of Socialist and Anarchist Collaboration. But the scene was now set for an acute swing to the Right under the aegis of a Communist-Republican bloc. The Socialist Caballero’s aim had been the impossible one of a bourgeois-democratic republic victorious over Franco—of course, together with some kind of workers’ control of production coexisting with private property. To the Stalinists, however, the struggle for preserving bourgeois democracy was itself subordinate to the needs of Soviet Union foreign policy, namely, that of keeping the goodwill of the French and British Imperialists. Thus their aim in Spain was to accept the dictates of Anglo-French imperialism which demanded a stabilised bourgeois regime based on the participation not only of the liberal bourgeoisie, but also of the big bourgeois and landlord forces behind Franco! With this end in view the Stalinists placed themselves openly on the side of the reactionary forces in the Republican camp, pursued a conciliationist policy towards Fascists in an attempt to âwin them over’, and became the most ruthless exterminators of the revolution.
The Negrin Cabinet, succeeding that of Caballero, signified the formation of the bourgeois-Stalinist bloc. Reaction now got under way with a vengeance. Fascists imprisoned by the popular tribunals were released in increasing numbers, while on the other hand criticism of the government was made treason. The denouncing of priests or of citizens as Fascists or anti-revolutionaries “unreasonably” or “without sufficient foundation” was made a penal offence, although the Stalinists, freely continued to slander the POUM as Fascists. Under a Stalinist police head the police force was purged of all worker elements. Under the Stalinist Minister of Agriculture, Uribe, the peasant collectives, which were fairly widespread were dissolved with the aid of Assault Guards and the land given back to the landlords and kulaks. In Aragon this was accomplished only after a campaign of ruthless suppression by military forces led by General Pozas, a member of the Communist Party. Under pretext of the needs of defence, the management of factories was taken over one by one by the Government and workers’ control ended.
The POUM was suppressed. Its entire executive including its leader Nin were arrested and jailed. Nin himself was removed to a Stalinist controlled prison where he was foully murdered by the Stalinists without any kind of trial whatsoever. The hounding and persecution of all revolutionaries including large numbers of CNT militants became a feature of the Stalinist-bourgeois regime. The Spanish workers had risen twice with arms in their hands, first to make the revolution and then to defend it. But their leadership had cruelly betrayed them. Now disheartened, disillusioned, apathetic, they watched their conquests being wiped away one by one.
Ten years before, in China, the Stalinists had betrayed the revolution. In Spain, however, they directly assumed the role of its executioners. The entire proletarian revolutionary vanguard was liquidated by them long before this could be done by Franco. Thus the Stalinists, by their criminal policy not only paved the way for the victory of Fascism, but executed in advance a goodly share of its labours.
The purely military struggle against Franco dragged on to its now inevitable conclusion. Town after town fell to the Fascists, generally without resistance, the Government commanders withdrawing without a struggle. The masses were not even given the opportunity to die fighting, but were left to be massacred by Franco’s execution squads. In 1938 Barcelona, the last stronghold, fell without a struggle, ringing down the last curtain on the tragedy of Spain.
“The crushing of Barcelona deals a terrible blow to the world proletariat, but also teaches a great lesson. The mechanics of the Spanish âPeople’s Front’ as an organised system of deceit and treachery of the exploited masses has been completely exposed. The slogan of âdefence of democracy’ has once again revealed its reactionary essence, and at the same time, its hollowness. The bourgeoisie wants to perpetuate its rule of exploitation. The workers want to free themselves from exploitation. These are the real tasks of FUNDAMENTAL classes in modern society.
“Miserable cliques of petty bourgeois middlemen, having lost the confidence and the subsidies of the bourgeoisie, sought to salvage the past without giving any concessions to the coming day. Under the label of the âPeople’s Front’ they set up a joint stock company. Under the leadership of Stalin they have assured the most terrible defeat when all the conditions for victory were at hand.
“The Spanish proletariat gave proof of extraordinary capacity for initiative and revolutionary heroism. The revolution was brought to ruin by petty despicable and utterly corrupted âleaders.’ The downfall of Barcelona signifies above all the downfall of the Second and Third Internationals, as well as of Anarchism, rotten to its core. Forward to a new road, workers! Forward to the road of the international Socialist revolution!” (Trotsky, The Tragedy of Spain ).
NATIONAL FRONT IN THE COLONIAL COUNTRIES
We noted earlier that the Communists and militant workers fleeing from the Kuomintang terror went into the peasant areas, where they were able form to a Red Army by gathering round themselves the revolting peasants. In 1931 the creation of the “Chinese Socialist Republic” was proclaimed. This consisted of six widely separated areas spread across Central China, with constantly fluctuating boundaries. The only stable area held from 1930-34 was the “Central Soviet District” with a population of 3 millions. For more than five years the Reds defeated five successive Kuomintang campaigns against them, a feat made possible against forces several times superior in armaments, principally because of the support they received from the population and the disintegration their propaganda caused among the Kuomintang soldiers.
None the less, a peasant war, however, heroic and sustained it may be, cannot succeed on its own. The C.P. of China had completely abandoned its tasks in the cities. The Trotskyists who were functioning as the Left Opposition of the party strove in vain to get the party to lead the workers in struggles for partial demands in the cities and to put forward a programme of democratic demands which would provide a starting point for rallying the dispersed and demoralised city workers. For, revival of the workers movement alone could provide the peasant revolt with the leadership that was indispensable for its success. In 1934 the Chinese Red Army was finally compelled to abandon Central China and to march into the North West, still farther away from the political and economic centres of the country.
After the 7th Congress of the Comintern in 1935, the Moscow bureaucrats, fearing Japanese invasion of the U.S.S.R. and desiring to swing the Chinese bourgeoisie into an anti-Japanese position, reversed its instructions to the Communist Party of China. In 1936 Mao Tse Tung publicly offered the “hand of friendship to Chiang” if he would fight Japan. A new national united front, called the “anti-imperialists united people’s front” now became the goal. The bloc between the Chinese C.P. and the Kuomintang was made in 1937. The Kuomintang terms were (1) Abolition of the Red Army, and its incorporation into the Government armies under the direct control of the Military Affairs Commission. (2) Dissolution of the “Soviet Republic”. (3) Cessation of all Communist propaganda. (4) Suspension of the class struggle. To all these terms the Communists formally acceded, protesting at the same time that they had in fact already carried out the most important of them. And thus, by completing a full historical cycle the Communists had returned again to the “national united front”, only on an infinitely lower and more shameful level.
In course of time the Communists openly renounced their radical agrarian programme; and made even no pretence of attempting to establish the “hegemony of the proletariat" in the anti-imperialist struggle.
Meanwhile Chiang Kai-shek conducted the war against Japanese imperialism half-heartedly and as a purely military struggle, placing his faith not in the support of the masses but in hopes of Anglo-American intervention. With the outbreak of the Imperialist War in 1939 these hopes were revived. From 1942, with the entry of Japan into the imperialist war, Chiang placed himself at the service of Anglo-American imperialism. After the conclusion of the imperialist war, China finds that she has got rid of Japanese imperialism only to become a semi-colony of American imperialism—thus bearing out the correctness of the Trotskyist analysis that the bourgeoisie of the colonial and semi-conlonial countries is incapable of leading a genuine struggle against imperialism, and that even when it does enter into a military struggle against one imperialism it is only to enter into the service of another.
In India too, the change from ultra-leftism to a policy of capitulation to the bourgeoisie was commenced in 1936. The Communist Party of India adopted the policy of “National Front”, counterpart of the Popular Front in the West. The Congress, yesterday the party of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie, was suddenly credited with a revolutionary role. Communists donned Khaddar and became loyal Congressmen, even preaching Ahimsa and propagating the Gandhist “constructive programme” of charka and humanitarian rural uplift. They blunted the growing class consciousness of the workers and deceived the petty bourgeois intelligentsia moving to the left with a diluted and distorted species of Marxism.
The Communist Party of India has prove itself to be as abject an instrument of the foreign policy of the Soviet bureaucracy as any other section of the Comintern, with local bureaucrats as cynical and dishonest as anywhere else. The Russo-German Pact in 1939 enabled them without difficulty to characterise the war that British Imperialism was waging at that time as an imperialist war. But Hitler’s attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 made them turn a complete somersault in December of the same year, when, according to them, the whole war became transformed into a people’s war against fascism. They openly advocated support of the imperialist war, called on workers to speed up production in the interests of the war effort, embarked on the most shameful racial attacks on the Japanese, opposed the mass struggle against British Imperialism that commenced in August 1942, and attempted to divert and disrupt the movement by advancing the deceitful slogans of “Release the Leaders”, “Congress-League Unity” and “National Government” (under imperialism).
The Fourth International movement in India is still young. The Bolshevik Leninist Party of India, section of the 4th International was formed only in 1942. It opposed the imperialist war and supported the mass struggle against imperialism, but without confounding its organisation or programme with the Congress of the bourgeoisie. The Fourth International movement in India can face the future with real hope and confidence. For, unlike in China, Germany and Spain, the Stalinists have not yet had the opportunity of leading the working class to any major defeat. The Indian working class, young and vigorous, has suffered no serious disaster to demoralise it and sap its faith in itself and its future.

Leslie Goonewardene
Rise And Fall Of The Comintern
The Tragedy Of The Chinese Revolution
Chapter Four

After the war, commencing May 1st 1919, there opened a period of militant workers’ struggles and growth of the working class movement in China. In the spring of 1923 Lenin wrote his last article, declaring that the revolution in the east was approaching. From then on, seized by his fatal disease, Lenin never worked again. Towards the end of 1923, Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev who were at the head of affairs decided in spite of all the teachings of Lenin which pointed to the necessity of or-ganising the working class independently of and against the bourgeoisie, and notwithstanding the experience of the Russian Revolution itself, that the young Communist Party of China should join the bourgeois nationalist Kuo-mintang. Trotsky opposed this measure, but to no avail.
In the middle of 1925 there occurred the General Strike in Shanghai as a protest against the shooting of workers and students by the British Imperialist police. The Chinese bourgeoisie supported the strike at the start but withdrew their support after a month. This strike showed clearly that the working class of China was the class that was destined to lead the assault against imperialism. The strike was settled in Shanghai but was the signal for over a hundred strikes of sympathy all over China, The mightiest of these was the famous Hongkong-Canton strike.
Both in Canton and British owned Hong Kong a boycott of British goods and a general strike was declared. The strike was complete. The workers set up their strike committee which functioned as the executive committee of an embryo soviet. It organised the strike, built up an armed guard of pickets and set up a strikers’ court which tried offenders. After a year the strike continued as strong as ever with the British capitalists losing half a million pounds a day! The Communist Party of China played a leading part. There was a rapid growth of trade unions all over China. The Communist Party membership, 800 in 1925, by January 1926 had risen to 30,000. To add to all this, the peasants, suffering under the feudal-militar-ist landlords and harassed by money-lenders, began to unite in a vast agrarian movement. The Chinese revolu-tion had started. With a correct leadership there were tremendous possibilities before it.
THE PERMANENT REVOLUTION
Trotsky’s theory of permanent revolution, the correctness of which was borne out by the whole ex-perience of the Russian revolution, is the sole means by which we can comprehend the revolutionary process in backward countries like China, India and Spain. It is the only sure guide to the success of the revolution in colonial and semi-colonial countries.
Trotsky points out that in the present imperialist epoch in which capitalism has become a world wide system, we have the phenomenon in backward countries of feudal and pre-capitalist forms existing side by side with the most modern capitalist forms. This is what he calls the law of combined development. The wooden plough and the bullock cart of the village co-exist with the power-driven machine and modern means of locomotion of the town. Together with semi-feudal relations in the land the most modern capitalist relations are reproduced in indus-try. This co-existence of the old with the new, of pre-capitalist with modern capitalist relations, has the most profound implications for the course of development of such backward countries.
The bourgeois-democratic revolution clearing the way for capitalist development which occurred in the advanced capitalist countries in previous centuries (in England in the 17th and in France in the 18th centuries) had not yet taken place in these backward countries. The tasks of this belated bourgeois revolution, particularly the abolition of a semi-feudal land system, have still not been completed. These backward countries therefore face a bourgeois-de-mocratic revolution, the basis of which is the land question. Now, in what manner will this revolution occur? In pre-vious centuries, the rising bourgeoisie provided leadership to the peasants who rose against the feudal landlords, and the revolution was accomplished in this manner. But the bourgeoisie of backward countries, which has come into existence only after the progressive role of the bourgeoisie in the world as a whole had been exhausted, can no longer perform this revolutionary role.
In the first place, having come late on the scene, they do not have the independence and strength of the early bourgeoisie of former times. They are from their birth connected with and dependent on international finance capital, that is, the big bourgeoisie of the leading imperialist countries. This is particularly evident in the bourgeoisie of colonial and semi-colonial countries. Here, although the local bourgeoisie may on occasion be prepared to play an oppositional role to the imperialists they do so not for the purpose of embarking on a revolutionary struggle to secure their independence, but only for striking a bargain with the imperialists. Even where they embark on a genuine struggle against one section of imperialism, they generally do so with the help, overt or secret, of another imperialist group and are in no case prepared to struggle for freedom from all imperialism.
Secondly, unlike the once revolutionary bourgeoisie of the advanced countries referred to earlier, which arose in opposition to the feudal landowning, classes and in struggle against it, the bourgeoisie of backward countries has deve-loped largely from the landowning class itself, and in any case is closely connected with the landlords, particularly through loans and mortgages. It is not surprising, therefore, that they are not prepared to help the peasants to overthrow landlordism.
Finally, and most important, the bourgeois-democratic revolution in England and France occurred at a time when there was no industrial proletariat in the modern sense. But the bourgeois democratic revolutions in backward countries are unfolding at a time when large con-centrations of workers already exist in these countries. And these workers are in daily conflict not only with the imperialist owners of capital but with the local bourgeoisie. The workers moreover, being a product not only of in-digenous capital, but also and in fact, predominantly—of foreign capital, have as a class grown to a degree out of all proportion to the size of the indigenous bourgeoisie. The suspicion and fear engendered by this realisation in the hearts of the indigenous bourgeoisie consequently not only prevents them from leading the bourgeois-democratic revolution but actually drives them to the camp of the imperialists and landlords on the approach of revolution.
The peasantry, history has taught us, is incapable of leading a revolution. The urban petty bourgeoisie in backward countries is a declining class. The only class, therefore, that can lead the bourgeois-democratic revolu-tion at the head of the peasantry for the overthrow of the power of the imperialists, of landlordism and for the remnants of feudalism is the working class. But this places before the working class the prospect of seizing the power and proceeding with the execution of its socialist tasks, and thus the bourgeois-democratic revolution de-velops uninterruptedly into the proletarian revolution and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In Russia the workers proceeded with their socialist tasks of the expropriation of the capitalists only several months after they had seized the power. In countries like India and China, however, where the imperialists are directly the main owners of capital, we can expect this stage to arise much earlier. The bourgeois democratic stage of the revolution in these countries will be much shorter and the proletarian stage arise much earlier than in Russia.
But the revolution cannot be established even at this stage. The world as we remarked at the outset has today become united in a single inter-connected economic system. And the contradiction of this world capitalist system can finally be resolved only on a world scale. The working class of any particular country after its victorious seizure of power is immediately faced with the task of effecting a socialist transformation of its property relations and of making the transition to Socialism. But this task it cannot accomplish alone. The international division of labour and the inter-dependence—produced by capital-ism itself—of the different parts of world economy, de-mand that this task of the establishment of socialism can be accomplished only on a world scale. The working class of the victorious country will of course proceed with the socialist transformation so far as it is able under the concrete circumstances, but the establishment of socialism will depend on the spread of the revolution to other coun-tries. In other words, the revolution in one country is a link in the inter-connected chain of world revolution. Either the revolution will spread step by step from country to country until it is victorious all over the globe, or it will recede and end ultimately in capitalist counter-revolution, This is Trotsky’s theory of permanent revolution, as founded on the experience of the Russian revolution of 1905 and confirmed by the subsequent experiences of Russia, China and Spain.
THE BLOC OF FOUR CLASSES OR THE CHINESE NATIONAL FRONT
On the basis of the strategy dictated by the theory of permanent revolution and on the basis of the strategy of Lenin and in the Russian revolution, the broad line of policy should have been clear. It was necessary in China to teach the workers from the very beginning to be mis-trustful of the native bourgeoisie, on the outbreak of the revolution to organise the workers independently of and against the bourgeoisie in Soviets, to help the peasants to organise in Soviets, to give full support to the peasant movement for the seizure of the land, and with the development of the revolution assured to it by the leadership of the working class, to establish the dictatorship of the prole-tariat.
But for Stalin the revolution was a bourgeois-democratic revolution which was to be led by the bourgeoisie in the Kuomintang. And the business of the workers, apparently, was to do nothing to impede the bourgeoisie. By the infamous policy of the “National United Front” or the “bloc of four classes” (workers, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie and “national” bourgeoisie), which is the counterpart of the “National Front” in India, the workers were forced to follow the bourgeoisie, and the Chinese revolution ended in an unmitigated tragedy.[1]
In early 1926, Chiang Kai Shek at the head of the Na-tionalist forces in the South planned to leave Canton in order to defeat the pro-imperialist war-lords of the North and to bring the whole of China under the Kuomintang Government. In order to get the help of the Chinese work-ers and peasants for this campaign, Chiang needed the support of the Comintern which the Chinese masses trusted.
But on March 20th 1926 Chiang Kai Shek with a sudden military coup seized the power in Canton, disarmed the Strike Committee headquarters, imprisoning the Com-munist Party leaders and other left-wingers. The Communists however learned nothing from this experience. In May they came to an agreement with Chiang. They promised not to criticise the anti-class struggle doctrines of Sun Yat Sen (the now dead Chinese nationalist leader) and to give a list of Communist Party members to Chiang. Members of the Communist Party were in future not to hold any important position in the Kuomintang or in the Government. And members of the Kuomintang were forbidden to join the Communist Party.
There were protests in the Chinese Communist Party. The necessity of a change of course became apparent even to the leaders. In June 1926 the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted a decision to withdraw from the Kuomintang and to continue work by means of a bloc with it from outside. This was however peremptorily overruled by the leadership of the Comintern. Even the organisation of Left-wing fractions within the Kuomintang was forbidden. Borodin, the representative of the Co-mintern in China declared “The present period is one in which the Communists should do coolie service for the Kuomintang”! (Isaac’s—The Tragedy of the Chinese Revo-lution ). The Communist Party was thus tied finally to the Kuomintang itself and the workers and peasants to the bourgeoisie.
Having thus tied hand and foot the revolution in the South, Chiang embarked on his Northern campaign with the full support of the Communists. He received the enthusiastic support of the workers and peasants on his journey, thanks to the prestige of the Russian revolution and the Soviet State which he was able to exploit through his association with the Comintern. But he forbade the Communist Party from agitating for Soviets or the confis-cation of the land, and permitted agitation only for in-creased wages and rent reduction. In October 1926 the Moscow leadership wired the Chinese Communists to keep the peasant movement in check in order not to alienate the Generals. Some months earlier, soon after the March coup the Politbureau of the Communists Party of the Soviet Union had—with Trotsky alone opposing— approved the admission of the Kuomintang as a “sympathising party” into the Communist International.
In Canton, the bourgeois Canton Government had in the meantime called off both strike and boycott, after a struggle of over 15 months. Regulations were issued providing for compulsory arbitration of trade disputes, forbidding workers to possess arms and to picket workplaces. The Com-munist Party, anxious to propitiate the Government, raised no protest.
THE SHANGHAI INSURRECTION
In February 1927 the revolutionary workers of Shan-ghai hearing of the triumphant approach of Chiang whom they had been taught to regard as the military General of the revolution, made a spontaneous general strike, 300,000 workers participating. The reactionary Military Governor of Shanghai embarked on a campaign of widespread repression and shooting of the workers. Meanwhile Chiang who had professedly come to Shanghai to defeat the reactionary military government there, had arrived at the gates of the city. But the “revolutionary General” made no attempt to come to the aid of the workers. The workers’ strike was brutally crushed. But their organisations were still intact and on March 21st the heroic workers rose again on one last great effort, and completely defeated and drove out the reactionary forces. All of Shanghai with the exception of the International Settle-ment and the French Concession was in their hands. More than half a million workers were ready to rise as one man at a word from the Union headquarters in defence of their conquests. They even set up a provisional govern-ment, apparently fully under Communist control.
On March 26th Chiang entered Shanghai and entered immediately into negotiations with Chinese bankers and merchants and the imperialists in order to make a bloody settlement with the workers. The Communists in a des-perate effort to placate him organised a reception and ban-quet in his honour, which he did not condescend to attend. Instead he was busy organising his forces for the attack. Gangsters of the Shanghai underworld were organised, soldiers sympathetic to the workers were replaced by fresh and âloyal’ battalions. The Communists of Shanghai, still acting under Stalin’s orders, made no attempt even now to warn the workers against the danger that was impend-ing. No propaganda was attempted among Chiang’s own soldiers, though not inconsiderable sections of them were already sympathetic to the workers.
In Moscow, Trotsky and the Opposition were warning against a counter-revolutionary blow and demanding the unconditional independence of the Chinese Communists. On April 3rd Trotsky submitted an article “Class relations in the Chinese revolution” warning against Chiang the “Chinese Pilsudski” and demanding immediate withdrawal from the Kuomintang. The article was refused publi-cation. On April 5th in a speech in the Hall of Columns in Moscow Stalin himself replied as follows to the Oppo-sition that the Soviet public were not permitted to hear “Chiang Kai Shek is submitting to discipline. The Kuomintang is a bloc, a sort of revolutionary parliament, with the Right, the Left, and the Communists. Why make a coup d’etat? Why drive away the Right when we have the majority and when the Right listens to us? …. Chiang Kai Shek has perhaps no sympathy with the revo-lution, but he is leading the army and cannot do otherwise than direct it against the Imperialists”. (see Issac’s -The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution —for the account of the suppression of this speech by Stalin when his words were refuted by events ten days later).
However, when the inevitability of a blow became apparent, the Executive Committee of the Comintern, still attempting to avoid a conflict with Chiang, wired to the Chinese Communists not to give up their arms, indeed not to use them, but to hide them. The revolutionary troops of the 1st Division whom Chiang had ordered to leave Shanghai were prepared to defy the orders and to stay be-hind to fight alongside the workers. But in view of the above instructions the Communist leaders did not accept the offer. The troops were transferred. On April 12th Chiang launched his terror on the workers of Shanghai. The Communist Party, the trade unions, and all workers’ organisations were completely and thoroughly smashed. The Communist Party had nothing to tell the workers. Without leadership, some offered no resistance. Others fought and were massacred.
As an epitaph to the Shanghai massacre Stalin announced on April 21st that “events have fully and entirely proved the correctness” of the Comintern line. (The Questions of the Chinese Revolution , by Stalin, published in International Press Correspondence of April 28th, 1927).
THE WUHAN DEBACLE
The Opposition, led by Trotsky, had all along demanded that the Communist Party should withdraw from the Kuomintang and should put forward the slogan of Soviets, since the Soviets are the only form of organisation that, drawing as they do, the wide masses of the toilers into them, can generate the strength to meet the blows of the reac-tionaries as well as to take the revolution forward. The Shanghai defeat had strikingly if not tragically demon-strated the correctness of the analysis of the Opposition. But the Shanghai defeat, though it was a staggering blow to the revolution need not have been fatal. In Hupeh and Hunan provinces the revolutionary tide among the peasantry was gathering force, and the workers here were capable of supplying leadership to the peasants.
But even now, after the example of Shanghai, the Comintern refused to recognise the necessity for the with-drawal of the Communist Party from the Kuomintang. Faith was now placed in the petty bourgeois government of Wang Chin Wei and others in Wuhan, and efforts were concentrated on turning this “Left” section against Chiang “the revolutionary Kuomintang in Wuhan,” now wrote Stalin, will in fact be converted into an organ of the revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the prole-tariat and peasantry … (we must adopt) the policy of concentrating the whole power in the country in the hands of the revolutionary Kuomintang.” The slogan of Soviets was inadmissible, continued Stalin. This would mean “issuing the slogan of a fight against the existing power in this territory … of the fight against the power of the revo-lutionary Kuomintang.” (Stalin—The Questions of the Chinese Revolution ). On May 18th at the 8th Plenum Trotsky declared, “The leaders of the Left Kuomintang of the type of Wang Chin Wei and Co. will inevitably betray you if you follow the Wuhan heads instead of forming your own independent Soviets. The agrarian revolution is a severe thing. Politicians of the Wang Chin Wei type, under difficult conditions, will unite ten times with Chiang Kai Shek against the workers and peasants”—(Problems of the Chinese Revolution  by Trotsky). Prophetic words, which were to be fulfilled in the space of two months.
The land question was the most important and imme-diate question facing the Chinese revolution. The petty bourgeois government at Wuhan however, had no inten-tion of giving the peasants the land. They only passed a paper resolution to make a 24 per cent. reduction on land rent. The Communists concurred. At this time a mass upsurge of the peasantry was developing which in strength and magnitude is comparable only with the rising of the peasantry in the Russian revolution. The land was seized, landlords driven off, peasants’ courts, peasant committees and peasant associations set up, women liberated, foreign missionaries packed off, and superstitions swept away in the mighty storm of the peasant revolt. Ten million peasants were drawn into the peasant organisation. But a peasant war, as we know, cannot achieve victory unless there is a more advanced class there to lead it. And the Comintern, by tying the class to the bourgeoisie in the Kuomintang, prevented the workers from supplying this leadership.
Towards the end of May the troops of the feudal mili-tarists raided the labour headquarters in Changsha, the capital of the province of Hunan, and killed hundreds of workers and peasants. On receiving this news thousands of peasants armed themselves and marched on Changsha, but were persuaded to disperse at the request of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Reaction now worked its revenge. The landlords came back with the militarists and in the course of the next few months over twenty thousand peasant men and women were killed in Hunan. After Changsha the terror spread to the province of Hupeh.
By the end of June Wang Chin Wei and the Wuhan Government had come to terms with Chiang Kai Shek and agreed to exterminate the Communists. By the middle of July the attacks on the trade unions were in full swing. Executions followed. Borodin, the Comintern represent-ative who had been sent to guide the Communist Party, hurriedly departed on his long journey to Russia. The Communist leaders fled. In Canton, Shanghai, Changsha, and now in Wuhan, the Chinese masses had seen the Kuo-mintang leaders whom the Communists taught them to regard as friends of the revolution, suddenly change into the cruel butchers of workers and peasants. Reaction now reigned from North to South. The Chinese revolution had been defeated.
The extent of the defeat cannot be measured merely by the actual physical annihilation. The workers and peas-ants had not merely fallen before a stronger enemy. They had been decapitated by their own leaders, by the very men and organisations that the Communists had taught them to trust. The demoralisation resulting from this, incal-culably deepened the effects of the counter-revolution.
But this did not prevent Stalin from writing as follows “Should the Chinese Communists have set up the slogan six months ago: âDown with the leadership of the Kuomintang’? No, for that would have been a very dan-gerous and precipitate step and it would have rendered the approach to the masses more difficult for the Communists, for the masses at that time still believed in the leadership of the Kuomintang. At that time the leadership of the Kuomintang in Wuhan had not achieved its highest point as a bourgeois-revolutionary government and had not yet discredited itself in the eyes of the masses through its fight against the agrarian revolution and by its defection to the counter-revolution. Should the Chinese Communists now set up the slogan âDown with the leadership of the Kuomintang?’ Yes, of - course, they must” he ponderously concludes. (International Press Correspondence , 4th August 1927). So according to Stalin the Communist Party must wait passively until the bourgeoisie is exposed by taking the open road to counter-revolution. It little, matters, apparently, that the revolutionary vanguard is exterminated. For the bourgeoisie will be exposed! It goes without saying that the workers and peasants could do infinitely better without such leadership.
The Opposition in Russia pointed out that the best that could be done now was to make an orderly retreat as the Bolsheviks had done under the leadership of Lenin after the defeat of the revolution of 1905 in Russia. It was necessary now to conserve the revolutionary forces in pre-paration for the next mass upsurge, even though that might take years to come. But the prestige of the Moscow ruling clique had to be maintained. The Opposi-tion was now attacked as liquidationists having no faith in the revolution. It was stated that the Slogan of Soviets was correct now and that the Chinese revolution had en-tered a higher stage.
The Old Chinese leadership was removed by the Comin-tern, and new leaders hastily appointed to carry out the new line. Mass expulsion of Chinese Communists who refused to accept the new line, took place. A series of armed uprisings were now organised which never had a chance of success and all ended in crushing defeat. The masses, instead of making the tremendous response that was expected simply refused to co-operate.
THE CANTON MASSACRE
The correctness of the criticisms of the Opposition was being demonstrated at every step. After the series of blunders and defeats, the Moscow leadership was now im-posing a policy of putschist adventures in a desperate effort to save their face. The most tragic of these disasters was at Canton.
Canton was the last industrial city in which the Com-munists still had a following. Though small in number, they consisted of those workers who had stuck to the Com-munist Party through all the difficulties and defeats. They constituted the best elements of the Canton proletariat and would have provided a splendid base for the slow and difficult tasks of the future. But the Opposition had to be proved wrong and Stalin correct. Under direct instruc-tions from Moscow the policy of insurrection was applied to Canton. If the mass insurrections of history, and parti-cularly the October insurrection, can teach us anything, it is that although the technical preparation of insurrection can be made to order, it cannot be successfully carried out except in conjunction with and indeed at the peak of the mass movement. But the Comintern leadership thought otherwise.
The Canton insurrection was timed to take place at the same time as the meeting of the 14th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, at which it was to be proved that the Chinese revolution had entered a higher stage. It is difficult to believe that this was accidental. On December 11th the Canton Communists and their mili-tant working class followers, in all numbering no more than a few thousand, staged an insurrection. A Soviet Govern-ment was declared. But the ill-fated Canton Commune as it afterwards came to be known, was not destined to last long. The masses who had accomplished miracles of revolutionary heroism in the Canton-Hongkong strike of a year ago had by now been disillusioned and demoralised. They merely stood aside and watched while the flower of the Canton proletariat fought a hopeless battle against Kuomintang troops numbering well over 50,000. About 1500 people escaped. The remainder stood their ground until the last of them was slaughtered by the attackers in the afternoon of December 13th. After the overcoming of the last resistance terror was let loose on the men, women and children of working class Canton. The exact number of killed is not known. The final toll of the count-ed dead was 5,700.
Reaction now reigned supreme. Under the Kuomin-tang terror men, women, children were mutilated, tortured, imprisoned and killed. It is estimated that between 1927 and 1930 over 100,000 were killed.
So great and disastrous was the defeat under the leader-ship of Stalinism that the Chinese workers have not re-covered to this day. The defeated Communists and worker militants who escaped from Canton and other cities now made their way to the mountainous districts of the central provinces and there formed partisan armies. With the spread of the peasant revolt to these previously untouched areas they formed peasant Soviets and declared the widely separated areas under their control “Soviet China.” But all this belongs to a period when the bureaucracy in Moscow having suffered defeat after defeat in the international as well as the national field by their rightist mistakes, had been compelled by circumstances to change their policy of going to the other extremes and embarked on a policy of ultra-leftism. It suffices to mention here that the peasant soviets of Red China without the workers in the towns to supply leadership, were doomed to defeat. The fact that it took Chiang Kai Shek six years to defeat them does not disprove the elementary truth of Marxism that the peasantry alone cannot accomplish a revolution. It is only a testimony to the heroism and self-sacrifice of the downtrodden Chinese peasantry. It also provides us with a glimpse of what might have been poss-ible if the proletariat in the towns, following a policy independent of the bourgeoisie had formed a worker-peasant alliance under its own leadership.
*******
The Russian revolution had demonstrated the correctness of the theory of permanent revolution. The Chinese revolution of 1925-27 provided added confirmation, though from the negative side. It proved that a backward coun-try could accomplish its bourgeois democratic revolution only by the establishment of the dictatorship of the pro-letariat. The “democratic dictatorship of proletariat and peasantry,” a formula which Lenin had abandoned in time to save the Russian revolution, was demonstrated in China to be nothing more than the Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. That the victory of the revolution can be accomplished not by “national fronts” but by the leadership of the pro-letariat in the bourgeois democratic revolution and the uninterrupted development of the latter into the prole-tarian revolution is the chief lesson to be learnt from the tragic experience of China.
[1] In February 1917 too, Stalin and the Bolshevik leaders in Russia believed that the Russian revolution was only a bourgeois-demo-cratic revolution and that Russia could not by her own forces proceed to the proletarian revolution. Since this was not substan-tially different from the position of the Mensheviks, Stalin actually prepared proposals for the merging of the Bolsheviks and Menshevik parties. Till the arrival of Lenin in April the Bolsheviks played the role of a constitutional Opposition party to the bourgeois Provisional Government. Lenin of course changed all this and set the party on the road to proletarian revolution. Stalin , Zinoviev, Kamenev and others at first opposed him, but soon gave in.

 Goonewardene: Rise And Fall Of The Comintern: Chapter 7    Leslie Goonewardene Rise And Fall Of The Comintern The Third Period Chapter Seven THE SIXTH CONGRESS The 6th Congress of the Comintern was held in July 1928 after an interval of four years. At this Congress an abrupt change was made from the previous policy of rightism—which had commenced in 1925-26—to one of ultra-leftism. It was announced that a new period in the history of the post-war world “the third period” had begun. (The first period had been declared ended in 1924. Now the second period too was over). The Social-Democratic reformists who had been the chief ally in the second period suddenly became the chief enemy. The Congress laid down that the world revolution was imminent, that the workers had lost faith in the Social-Democrats, and that the task of the Communist Parties was now to lead the insurrectionary masses to victory. The defeated Chinese revolution was proclaimed to have entered a, newer and higher phase. The third period was declared to be one characterised by the increasing radicalisation of the masses simultaneously in every country. Stalin’s theory of Social Fascism, invented in 1924, and conveniently forgotten in the period of Rightism, was now revived. The Social-Democrats and not the Fascists were now declared to be the chief enemy. That the masses in most countries (with the notable exception of China) were showing signs of unrest and preparing the march forward was true. The British General Strike of 1926 and the Chinese Revolution (1925-27) the Opposition had pointed out long ago, had checked the ebb tide of reaction, and heralded new upheavals. Capitalism too, it had added, was heading for crisis. But it would be fantastic to say that the masses were disillusioned with the Social-Democrats and were prepared to follow the Communists. That future events would discredit the Social-Democrats who today commanded the allegiance of a majority of the workers, was true. But if their following were to turn to the Communists, a correct application of the tactic of the united front was necessary. Again, no guide could have been better in this regard than the decisions of the 3rd and 4th Congresses of Lenin’s time. But the epigones had no need for the teachings of Lenin save to utilise them, torn from their context, for their own bureaucratic purposes. It is the duty of communists to work in mass organisations even though these may be under reformist leadership. For when, with the maturing crisis the workers become disillusioned in their leaders, the communists must be there to lead the workers into the revolutionary path, if this disillusionment is not to lead to demoralisation and defeat. But the isolation of the Communist Parties in the coming years was completed by the disastrous policy of splitting from the Social-Democratic trade unions and forming Red Trade Unions under Communist leadership. Instead of a united front with the “Social-Fascist trade union bureaucracy” there was to be created a “united front from below”—that is a united front in which the workers following the Social-Democrats were expected to accept Communist leadership. At the 6th Congress the Comintern Programme drawn up by Bukharin was adopted. It incorporated the theory of Socialism in one country, and. prescribed the misleading slogan of âdemocratic dictatorship of workers and peasants’ (discarded by Lenin in 1917) for colonial and semi-colonial countries. The Draft Programme of the C.I.—A Criticism of Fundamentals , written by Trotsky from his exile in Alma Ata and issued by the Left Opposition, provided a masterly survey of the international movement from 1923-27 and an acute analysis of the burning questions of the movement and particularly of the theory of Socialism in one country. To this day it continues to be the foremost Marxist document of the post-war revolutionary movement. As was to be expected, it was suppressed by Stalin. Those delegates from abroad who were permitted to see it were not allowed to take a copy of it with them out of Russia. Ultimately a copy had to be smuggled out. ULTRA-LEFTISM IN THE INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT The adoption of the ultra-leftist policy of the “third period” led, as was to be expected, to another series of expulsions in the international field of all those who refused to accept this sudden change of policy. Unlike in the Russian Parties, there were evidently still left in other sections of the International, individuals who refused to realise that their function was blindly to follow the leader in Moscow. Lovestone, Gitlow, and Wolfe, who commanded the allegiance of a majority in the American party were expelled as agents of the American bourgeoisie. Jilek in Czechoslovakia, Doriot and Sellier and all their supporters in France, Brandler and Thalheimer in Germany with many class conscious workers, Kilboom with the bulk of the party in Sweden, Strasser and Schlamm in Austria, Chen Tu Hsiu the founder and leader of the party in China, Nin, Andrade and Maurin in Spain were all expelled from the Comintern. M.N. Roy who had denounced Trotsky as the agent of Chamberlain now found himself denounced in the same manner. The long series of expulsions mortally wounded the Comintern sections and stultified their ability not only to act correctly but to think at all. Only the “obedient fools” against whom. Lenin had warned were now left. They obediently led the movement to ineffectiveness and isolation in many countries and to its biggest and gravest defeat in Germany. In China, as we had occasion to remark earlier the Communists in this period pursued a policy of building a Soviet China based on the peasants. The flames of the peasant revolt which had not yet died down provided them with a temporary base for their military operations against the Kuomintang armies of Chiang Kai Shek. Comintern writers have made varied claims with regard to the population of Soviet China. Their figures, varying from 50 million to 90 million, are obviously exaggerated. Soviet China was not only remote from the urban centres, but the areas themselves were continually changing according to the fortunes of war. However, the yearly campaigns of Chiang Kai Shek for five years with a large modern army supported by bombing planes of the European Imperialists, were failures. The difficulties of transport in the mountainous country, the support the Red Army received from the peasants and the desertions of Chiang’s own troops all combined to upset Chiang’s plans. Nevertheless, only real proletarian leadership of the agrarian revolt could save it from ultimate disintegration and defeat. And Communist Party leadership was not a substitute for the leadership of the proletariat. The leadership of the workers in the great urban centres was necessary. But the Communists steadily drained away the best elements from the cities into the Chinese Red Army, thus depriving the city workers of their best leaders. The Opposition pointed out correctly that instead of spending their entire efforts for a peasant war doomed to defeat, the main task of the Communist Party of China was to return to the urban centres and there, bit by bit, by struggling for democratic rights and the workers’ most elementary demands, patiently to attempt to build their base once again in the working class. It would be a difficult task but that was the only way by which the Communists could be at the head of the next revolutionary wave. The Oppositionists were of course denounced as traitors who wanted to dissolve “Soviet China of 90 millions.” The Chinese Communists and Red Army fought valiantly, if vainly, for the Chinese revolution that had “entered a higher stage” in the mountainous districts of China’s interior. This is the reason why the Communist Party of China to this day has no base in the working class. In India there developed in this period a mass movement against Imperialism in the form of the Civil Disobedience-Movement of 1930-33. Though it was a movement conducted under the treacherous bourgeois leadership of the Indian National Congress, nevertheless it was a mass movement against Imperialism, and the place of the Communists was inside it. A correct policy of participation in the movement while preserving their organisational identity and freedom of criticism and action with the purpose of developing the movement into a revolutionary assault on Imperialism, was pregnant with possibilities. At all events, the discrediting of the anti-revolutionary bourgeois-leadership would have been possible and the position of the Communists enormously strengthened. But a policy, in keeping with the ultra-leftism of the Comintern line, of standing aloof from the mass movement and criticism from outside, resulted in the isolation of the Communists. The Spanish revolution of 1931 which drove Alfonso from the throne passed by the Communists without noticing them. Their tirades against Social-Fascism did not touch the masses. In country after country, the ultra-leftism of the Comintern resulted in futile and ineffective criticism and only succeeded in further isolating its sections. It is important to draw a sharp distinction between this ultra-leftism imposed by the bureaucracy on the degenerated Comintern and the ultra-leftism which occurred in Lenin’s time, in the first post-war years of 1920-21. Then it had been a misguided policy by the young Communist Parties motivated by an honest revolutionary zeal. But in the years 1929-33 it was an open betrayal of the interests of the international proletariat, for which the Stalinist bureaucracy must bear full responsibility. THE RISE OF FASCISM IN GERMANY Fascism is a form of government to which the bourgeoisie resorts in the present era of the permanent decline of capitalism, when it finds that the system of government known as bourgeois democracy no longer suffices to maintain its dictatorship. Rudely tearing aside the democratic drapings of the parliamentary system, it institutes the unchallenged supremacy of finance-capital in all state and administrative fields. It destroys not only the advance guard of the working class—the party of the proletariat—but also trade unions and all independent organisations of workers, thus demolishing all the defensive bulwarks of the working class and keeping the entire class in a state of forced disunity and subjection. In developed capitalist countries, however, where powerful trade unions and workers’ political parties exist, this transformation cannot be achieved by the normal methods of police terror without immediately inviting a social upheaval. The big bourgeoisie therefore find it necessary, by means of the Fascist movement, to utilise against the working class the dissatisfied petty bourgeoisie and lumpen proletariat that capitalism itself has created, in order to institute its own undisputed way. In these countries, therefore, Fascism assumes the character of a mass movement of the petty bourgeoisie and gives the appearance of being a movement directed not only against the workers but also against the big bourgeoisie. German capitalism, restrained from expanding by the defeat in the last war and the Treaty of Versailles, of all countries in the world displayed in the most acute fashion the contradictions of capitalism in the present epoch. Nevertheless, till 1928, with the financial aid of America, the German bourgeoisie continued to lean on the Social-Democrats and to pin their hopes in bourgeois democracy. However, the devastating effects of the world economic crisis of 1929 on the German bourgeoisie produced a sharp turn in their policy. From then on they began increasingly to support the National Socialist Party of Hitler as the only party capable of saving German capitalism from collapse. The real expansion of the Fascist movement commences precisely from this time when the big bourgeoisie commenced to take the movement under its wings. The elections of September 1930 first revealed the danger. The Fascists increased their votes by over five million, polling six million votes, that is, as much as the Social Democrats, the largest single party in the Reichstag. That the German Communist Party had also increased their votes from four to six million was true. But this only signified that the crisis of capitalism was splitting society into two irreconcilable camps at the expense of the middle parties. (The poll of the Communist Party in fact, increased almost to the very end. But that of the Fascists increased incomparably more). The crisis can be ultimately resolved by the victory either of Fascist reaction or of proletarian revolution. In the meantime, which of these two solutions it was to be depended on the effectiveness of the tactics of the Fascists on the one hand and of the party of the revolutionary proletariat on the other. It is not necessary to endow Hitler and his lieutenants with any extraordinary strategic ability to say that the tactics of the Fascists proved infinitely superior to those of the Communist Party. The crying need of the hour was for a united front of the working class against the looming danger of Fascism. More specifically, what was required was a united front between the Social Democratic and Communist Parties which together commanded the allegiance of a majority of the working class. Such a united front would immediately alter the correlation of forces. The forces of working class would increase not two fold but tenfold. Under the influence of the forces generated, the wavering sections of the pretty bourgeoisie would be drawn behind the workers. The prospect of the seizure of power would be posed before the workers not merely as a historical necessity but as practical possibility. The moment the imminence of the Fascist danger was removed, the Social Democratic leaders, would, no doubt, draw away with alacrity. But what section of the proletariat would they be able to draw with them? With a bold and resolute leadership the Communist Party could lead the workers to the seizure of power. To ask the question, would they have won, is to mistake Marxism for astrology. At all events, there was every reasonable chance of victory and the alternative was—the tragic result that has followed. The growth of Fascism if it signified anything, signified the approaching end of bourgeois democracy. Henceforth, there were only two roads for Germany to travel, that of Fascist reaction or of proletarian revolution, and the necessary first step to her taking the latter road was the creation of the united front. THE SUICIDAL POLICY OF STALINISM After the German defeat, Stalinist apologists have glibly placed the responsibility for the victory of Fascism on the Social Democracy, hoping thereby to absolve themselves from all blame. That the German Social Democratic Party played a criminal role in the crisis is indubitable. But the Social Democratic Party, though composed of workers, is a bourgeois influence in the working class. It is incapable of revolutionary struggle and can only lead the workers to defeat. And it is precisely to snatch the workers from the demoralising influence of the Social Democracy that the Communists International was created in 1919. The bureaucracy of the German Social Democratic Party, desiring to preserve the âstatus quo’ with the comfortable government and trade union jobs, it assured them, feared, it is true, the advent of Fascism. But to the end they hoped to defeat the Fascist bands not with the mass organisations at their disposal but with the state police. That the Social Democrats preferred the prospect of maintaining their alliance with the bourgeoisie to entering into a united front with a party they believe to be revolutionary, is clear. But the Social Democratic leaders of no country make united fronts with revolutionary parties until they are forced to do so by the pressure of the masses. And the German Social Democratic leaders were no exception against the Fascists. If the Communist Party had carried on a persistent campaign among the Social Democratic workers, it is indubitable that the leaders would have been compelled to enter into a united front, or in the alternative, to lose their mass following. But the Communist Party, acting in accordance with the decision of the 6th Congress, labelled the Social Democrats (and along with them the Left Opposition who were demanding a united front) as Social Fascists. Instead they prescribed the united front from below. In September 1930, the Rote Fahne  (the German Communist daily) declared, “the 14th of September was the high point of the National Socialist movement in Germany. What comes after this can only be decline and fall”. But all through 1931 the crisis continued to mature and Hitler’s following to increase. The Communists continued to call the Social Democrats the chief enemy, and Red Trade Unions were fostered in opposition to the Social Democratic trade unions. They even tried to outdo the Fascists by taking their chauvinist slogan of scrapping the Versailles Treaty. In the summer of 1931 in the midst of their campaign against the Social Democrats the Communist Party suddenly sent an ultimatum to the Social Democratic ministers in the Prussian Government demanding a united front between the two parties. The offer, as was to be expected, was refused. The communists in reply supported the Fascists in their attempt to oust the Social Democratic Government in Prussia by referendum. This criminally mistaken manoeuvre was undertaken not on the initiative of the German Communist Party but on the advice of Moscow. Later in the year a section of the Social Democratic Party voiced its desire for a united front with the Communists. But Thaelmann, the leader of the Communist Party scornfully warned the workers against this “new demagogic manoeuvre” of the Social Fascists. Thus instead of helping the Social Democratic workers to find their way to the Communists through experience, the Communist Party helped the Social Democratic leaders to avoid the question of a united front and to maintain their demoralising influence over the workers. Towards the end of 1931 it was clear that the Comintern had resigned itself to the victory of Hitler in Germany. The whole line of propaganda was aimed at showing that the present “Social Fascist” government or Hitler’s Fascist Government made little difference to the workers. In other words, the Comintern was preparing to hand over the power to Hitler without a struggle. Incredible though this may appear, this was so, and this was precisely what eventually happened. In October 1931, Remmele, one of the three leaders of the Communists, declared in the Reichstag “Once they (the Fascists) are in power then the united front of the proletariat will be established and it will make a clean sweep of everything … We are not afraid of these Fascist gentlemen. They will shoot their bolt quicker than any other Government”. This criminal policy had its source, as we shall see, in the foreign policy considerations of the Soviet bureaucrats. At the same time it is likely that the leaders in the Kremlin with their lack of vision and bureaucratic stupidity realised no more than the bureaucrats of the Social Democracy what precisely the victory of Fascism would mean. Not that they had had no warnings. In November 1931 Trotsky wrote from Prinkipo, “The coming into power of the German âNational Socialists’ would mean above all the extermination of the flower of the German proletariat, the disruption of its organisations, the extirpation of its belief in itself and its future … Retreat, you say, you who were yesterday the prophets of the âthird period’? Leaders and institutions can retreat, individual persons can hide. But the working class will have no place to retreat in the face of Fascism, and no place where to hide … Ten proletarian insurrections, ten defeats one on top of the other, could not debilitate the German working class as much as a retreat before Fascism would weaken it at the given moment. (Germany—the Key to the International Situation ). In January 1932 Trotsky again wrote making an acute Marxist analysis of the situation in his book “What Next” and appealed to the members of the Communist Party of Germany to force their leaders to enter into a united front with the Social Democrats. But the numerically weak Left Opposition, pitted against the powerful bureaucracies of the Social Democratic and Communist Parties who alike opposed the united front, could not get their policy accepted. They were branded by the Comintern as “Counter-revolutionaries”. In the âCommunists International’ of March 15th 1932, Paitnitzky the Secretary of the Communist International wrote, “The Social Democrats too sometimes put forward the slogan of unity. And in this the renegade Trotsky hastens to their aid with his proposal for a âbloc’ between the Communists and the Social Democrats”. CAPITULATION AND DEFEAT By the middle of 1932 the economic crisis intensified. Production fell, wages decreased and the number of unemployed rose nearly seven million. In July the Social Democratic Government was dissolved. No protest took place. In the elections at the end of July, the Nazis polled 13 million votes, the Social Democrats 7 millions, and the Communists 5 million. The centre parties had by now practically disappeared. Roughly speaking, the workers had instinctively moved to the Left, and thanks to the disunity of the workers, the petty bourgeoisie to the Right. Votes, however, are not the deciding factor, and still the relationship of forces could have been decisively changed. But in the face of the disunity of the workers the aggressiveness of the Fascists increased. In September 1932 these 5 adopted by the 12th Plenum of the E.C.C.I., declared, “Only by directing the main blows against Social Democracy, this social mainstay of the bourgeoisie—will it be possible to strike at and defeat the chief class enemy of the proletariat—the bourgeoisie.” Piatnitzky said in his speech, “This united front must be directed against the Social Democrats and the trade union bureaucracy.”[1] At the end of January 1933 Hitler was appointed Chancellor. In March Hitler burned the Reichstag. On April 1st the Presidium of the E.C.C.I. passed a resolution ratifying the policy of the German Party, which stated, “The revolutionary upsurge in Germany will inevitably grow in spite of the Fascist terror. The resistance of the masses to Fascism is bound to increase. The establishment of an open Fascist dictatorship, by destroying all the democratic illusions among the masses and liberating them from the influence of Social Democracy, accelerates the rate of Germany’s development towards proletarian revolution.” (The Present Situation in Germany , by O. Piatnitzky—Modern Books.) The Social Democratic leaders, true to type, now tried to enter service under Hitler. But on May 1st commenced Hitler’s offensive. He spared no one, not even the âSocial Fascists’. Arrests, beatings, murders, confiscations of trade unions’ funds, became the order of the day. There was no resistance. The leaders who could, escaped. The remainder were rounded up by the Fascists and imprisoned or killed. Without leadership, a disorderly retreat of the masses began. The workers’ organisations were systematically broken up and the flower of the German proletariat of Europe, with the largest mass organisations and Communist Party outside Russia, succumbed to Fascist reaction without a struggle. And the international working class movement suffered the biggest defeat in its history. In December 1933, when there were only isolated groups of Communists left, as an echo from the past, the Report of the 13th Plenum monotonously repeated, “Social Democracy continues to the role of the main social prop of the bourgeoisie also in countries of open Fascist dictatorship.” In Germany, continued the Plenum, “enormous revolutionary energy is being accumulated among the masses and a new revolutionary upsurge is already beginning.” The Plenum again ratified the policy pursued in Germany as correct. The Comintern leadership is never wrong. It shares with the Pope the mystic quality of infallibility. And it demands like His Holiness unquestioning and unthinking obedience. The theory of Social Fascism invented by Stalin in 1924, we recollect, was not officially discarded in the Rightist period of 1925-27. That is not Stalin’s way. It was merely set aside for future use. Revived again in the âthird period’, we have witnessed the part it played in determining the destinies of the German proletariat. After 1933 it was put away again, unobtrusively, silently for there is nobody to question. Never refuted, the theory of Social Fascism has remained to this day as part of the official doctrine of the Comintern, Perhaps Stalin hopes that one day again … THE COMINTERN—AN INSTRUMENT OF SOVIET RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY How can we explain the criminal blindness of the policy of the Comintern in regard to Germany? It is possible to understand this only if one has understood the nature of the transformation that had come over the Comintern in the preceding years from 1923 to 1928. In this period, we noted, the Comintern was converted from an organisation for World Revolution into a docile instrument of the bureaucracy of the Soviet State. Having liquidated the Left and Right Oppositions, the bureaucracy had the unfettered freedom with unparalleled callousness to use the Comintern as an instrument of its foreign policy. The foreign policy of the Soviet Union, aimed at preventing military intervention, quite naturally saw in Franco-German antagonism in the post-war years a guarantee against intervention from the West. But the German Social Democracy, pursuing a policy of conciliation towards Britain and France, appeared to be progressively bridging this gap. This made the German Social Democracy the bitter enemy of the Soviet bureaucracy. The exigencies of the struggle against the Opposition had prevented this antagonism from attaining its proper expression till 1928. But even as early as 1927 we find that in Germany the Left leaders of the Social Democrats had been declared to be the chief enemy. The growth of the party of Hitler, on the other hand, meant that the gap between Germany and France would widen. The precise meaning of the coming to power of Hitler for all organisations of the working class including the Communist Party itself, the Stalinist bureaucracy, as we remarked earlier, were in all probability incapable of perceiving. Remmele had said, “We are not afraid of these Fascist gentlemen …” To the unimaginative bureaucrats the government of Bruning had already a Fascist character. A government of Hitler would be but another Fascist government, only more Fascist perhaps. And Hitler unlike the Social Democrats, was the sworn enemy of France. And thus, the Social Democrats, the chief enemy of the Soviet bureaucracy, became also the chief enemy of the German workers. The cause of proletarian revolution in Germany was sacrificed, apparently for the peaceful construction of Socialism in Russia, but actually to perpetuate the regime of the bureaucracy. For the question of Socialism in Russia will be decided not within its national boundaries but in the wider arena of the international revolution. Viewed in the light cast upon events by the unravelling of Soviet Russian foreign policy in this period, the whole policy of the Comintern in Germany takes on a lurid colour. Not only the direction of the main attack against the Social Democrats, but also the adaptation to nationalist agitation in the attack on the Treaty of Versailles, the support of the Fascist referendum in Prussia, the systematic lulling of the workers into a false sense of security as regards the Fascist danger, and finally the cowardly surrender without a struggle of all the positions to Fascism hitherto inexplicable acquire meaning and intelligibility in their new relations. Soviet Russian foreign policy is, of course, perfectly justified in exploiting differences and cleavages between different imperialist camps to its own advantage. But to betray the interests of proletarian revolution for the sake of day-to-day considerations of foreign policy is an unpardonable crime. The defeat of the German proletariat in 1933 marked the end of the period in which the Left Opposition functioned as an Opposition group attempting to reform the 3rd International. The German Catastrophe demonstrated in, glaring fashion the extent of the degeneration of the Comintern and the impossibility of effecting its reform. From a subjective factor for world revolution it had transformed itself into an objective obstacle to it. Thus arose inexorably the need for building a new International. The Left Opposition took the initiative in calling for the organisation of new Communist Parties and of a new, Communist, Fourth International.

Rise And Fall Of The Comintern
The Third International
Chapter Two

With the outbreak of the war in 1914 the Second International collapsed. It collapsed not merely in the formal sense that no contact was possible between the different parties in the belligerent countries. But by collaboration with the national bourgeoisie it ceased to stand for the international solidarity of the working class, and ceased to be an instrument of emancipation of the working class. Lenin was quick to realise this, and within a month of the outbreak of war he wrote on the necessity of building a new international.
In 1915 Lenin at the head of the Bolshevik delegation attended a conference of anti-war Socialists at Zimmerwald.. Here Lenin put forward the uncompromising line that a correct proletarian policy for obtaining peace, was to con-vert the imperialist war into Civil War by revolution. This policy was too extreme for the majority of delegates. It was the same at another anti-war conference held at Kienthal the following year. But Lenin was building around him a group of uncompromising revolutionary internationalists who were to form the foundation of the new revolutionary international.
THE FOUNDING OF THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL
The victorious proletarian revolution took place in Russia in November 1917. In March 1918 the Soviet Government was forced to conclude peace with Germany at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on very unfavourable terms. After the defeat of Germany by the Allies came the period of interventionist war against the U.S.S.R. The young workers’ state was attacked on all sides by counter-revo-lutionary armies financed and armed by the Allies. In late 1918 and early 1919 the Soviet armies suffered defeat after defeat. It was in the midst of this crisis that Lenin called for the formation of the new International.
The Third International was formed at a Conference held in Moscow, in March 1919. It was not a large confer-ence. It was very difficult to reach Russia at that time, and very few were able to get through. The only dele-gates who arrived from abroad were from Germany, America, Austria, Norway, Sweden and a few other small countries. The other foreign parties were represented by persons already in Russia. Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, the leaders of the Spartacists in Germany, who represented the revolutionary workers who had broken from the Second International, had been murdered by the soldiers of the German Social-Democratic Noske, or they would have been present.
The first Congress took a very definite stand against the reactionary effort to rebuild the Second International in its pre-war form, and stood for the organisation of the international proletarian vanguard in a homogenous revo-lutionary International. The main features of the Congress pitilessly exposed the treacherous pacifism of the American President Wilson and the illusion of a capitalist League of Nations which was supported by the Second International. At this congress Lenin’s theses on “Democracy and Dictatorship” were adopted, which showed on the basis of the experience of the Russian revolution the necessity for the destruction of the bourgeois state apparatus and the establishment of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat on the basis of Soviets.
Immediately following the war there occurred a powerful growth of the mass movement in practically all countries of the world. The masses began to see through the treacherous role played by the reformist leaders. Under pressure of the masses some of those reformist leaders (of the German Independent Socialist -Party, the Italian Socialist Party, the French Socialist Party, the British I.L.P. etc.) sought affiliation to the Communist Interna-tional without changing their reformist and pacifist ideas. This danger of the introduction of opportunist tendencies into the ranks of the Comintern was counteracted at the Second Congress (1920) which adopted the 21 points con-ditioning membership of the Comintern. A complete break with all pacifist ideas and illusions (such as disar-mament, League of Nations, International arbitration, etc.) was demanded; and in place of a loose organisation of nationally independent parties (as in the Second International), it was decided to build the Comintern as a world party on the foundation of a common theory and practice, and with the aim of realising a common international leadership on the basis of the principles of democratic centralism.
Those politicians who had been hindered by the decisions of the Second Congress from joining the Comintern there-upon organized a 2_ International, standing midway between the second and third Internationals. But there was no basis for such an organisation. The 2_ Interna-tional was crushed in the struggle between the second and third Internationals. Its revolutionary elements turned to the third International. Its bureaucratic tops re-united in 1923 with the second International.
THE THIRD AND FOURTH CONGRESSES
In the German revolution of 1918, the Hungarian revolution of 1919, in the movement of the Italian workers in 1920, the absence of a revolutionary party with a far-sighted and bold leadership proved fatal to success.
“The post-war revolutionary movement of the masses was strong enough to overthrow the bourgeoisie. But there was no one to bring this to a consummation. The social-democracy, which held the leadership of the tradi-tional organizations of the working class, exerted all its efforts to save the bourgeois regime. When we looked forward at that time to an immediate seizure of power by the proletariat, we reckoned that a revolutionary party would mature rapidly in the fire of a civil war. But the two terms did not coincide. The revolutionary wave of the post-war period ebbed before the communist parties grew up and reached maturity in the struggle with the social-democracy so as to assume the leadership of the insurrection.” (Trotsky—Third International After Lenin , Page 87.)
The vital importance, in the post-war period, of correct leadership for success is well illustrated in the following passage by Trotsky. “In a period of growing capitalism even the best party leadership could do no more than only accelerate the formation of a workers’ party. Inversely, mistakes of the leadership could retard this process. The objective pre-requisites of a proletarian revolution matured but slowly, and the work of the party retained a prepara-tory character.
Today, on the contrary, every new sharp change in the political situation to the left places the decision in the hands of the revolutionary party. Should it miss the critical situation, the latter veers round to its opposite. Under these circumstances the role of the party leadership acquires exceptional importance. The words of Lenin to the effect that two or three days can decide the fate of the international revolution would have been almost incom-prehensible in the epoch of the Second International. In our Epoch on the contrary, these words have only too often been confirmed and, with the exception of October, always from the negative side.” (Ibid . page 83.)
In these circumstances, the responsibility of the Comintern was tremendous. Correct leadership by the Comintern was essential if the Communist Parties of the various countries were to lead the workers to victory. Till 1923, the Third International performed this task creditably.
In March 1921, despite the fact that the revolutionary wave was ebbing in Germany the young German Com-munist Party decided to overthrow the bourgeois regime at one blow. The guiding thought of the German Central Committee was to save the Soviet Republic. Needless to say, the effort ended in defeat. The determination of the leadership and the dissatisfaction of the masses does not suffice for victory. The masses must have confidence in the leadership of the party to follow it. Other Communist parties too had been showing signs of “ultra-leftism.” In fact in 1921 Lenin had written his “Left Wing Com-munism, An Infantile Disorder” as a corrective to these tendencies.
The third Congress of the Comintern held in 1921 made every effort to counteract the infantile disorder of ultra-leftism of its sections. It pointed out that the existing Communist Parties, politically as well as organisationally, were not ripe enough for the conquest of power. It advanced the slogan “To the masses,” that is, To the con-quest of Power, through a previous conquest of the masses. Lenin had to struggle hard against the ultra-leftists who were led by Bukharin, in order to get his policy accepted. The decisions of the third Congress and of the fourth Con-gress which confirmed and amplified these decisions in 1922, are invaluable to this day. They laid down the policy of united front with the social democratic parties on the basis of transitional demands, preserving the independence, of the proletarian party, by which the working class could be taken forward to the conquest of power.
But the German events of 1923 showed that the Leninist policy had not been grasped, not only by the Communist Party of Germany but also by the leaders of the Comintern itself.
