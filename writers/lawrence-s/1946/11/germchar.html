<p class="fst">To provide ideological aid to the Allied subjugation of Germany, a
large group of economists, psychologists, sociologists and
journalists have been propounding a theory that German character
contains unique elements which make it especially susceptible to
totalitarian movements. Germans are supposed to be traditionally
prone to militarism; they are said to be inherently submissive and
their greatest joy is found, we are told, in blind devotion to a
leader and adherence to barbarous acts .of brutality. Having welcomed
fascism, they are therefore held &#8220;collectively guilty&#8221; for its
crimes; and it is their &#8220;national character&#8221; which is at the root
of all this evil.</p>

<p>Thus are the complacent &#8220;victors&#8221; of the war constructing a
nebulous justification for their reactionary role in world
politics, at the same time that they succeed in beclouding the real
meaning of the conceptions of national character and national
differences. We shall here attempt to show that to postulate a
typical German &#8220;national character&#8221; is to distort deliberately
the evolutionary historical picture of German society; that not a
single trait of the formidable list of accusations is uniquely
German; and that, in particular, aggressiveness, allegiance to a
leader and tight discipline are universal characteristics of certain
kinds of groups.</p>

<p>It is worth while, at the beginning, to note that the most
important untruth arising from these accusations is the myth that
fascism in Germany was inevitable because of this German temperament.
If the theory is propagated that there is something inherently
Germanic about fascism; if fascism is regarded as a collective
madness peculiar to certain evil nations, it is impossible to explain
how it really arises, how it can be fought, or how to recognize it in
the United States, where as yet it wears no brown shirts.</p>

<p>A century ago the German was generally supposed to be intelligent,
kindly, peaceable, fond of music and the home. Other prevalent
stereotypes were concerned with his scientific-mindedness,
industriousness, stolidness, methodicalness and progressiveness.</p>

<p>During World War I, however, one became suspect if one did not
call the Germans bloodthirsty savages. These propagandist mythologies
about the rapacious Germans were forgotten during the spread of
post-war disillusionment and pacifism and amid the general
stabilization of capitalism. With the Second World War, this
extremely convenient theory was again trotted out. The attributes of
the national characteristics of the Germans were &#8220;changed&#8221; with
successive historical periods &#8211; the revolution of 1848, the
conservative traditions of the Hohenzollerns from 1871&#8211;1918, the
&#8220;democratic&#8221; Weimar Republic, and finally the Nazi terror regime
&#8211; depending upon the political propaganda needs of this school of
national character analysts.</p>
<p>However, while such a crude, propagandist concept of German
national character does not stand up in the face of its own
contradictions, does such a phenomenon exist at all? Can a group have
a common character any more than it can have a common pair of lungs
or, more important, a common soul? Or is the term <em>merely</em> a
demagogic tool used in behalf of prevailing power politics? Let us
see, then, how various writers and students approach this problem,
beginning with political analysts and proceeding then to
psychologists who apply their concepts to the problem.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The Ludwig and De Sales Schools</h4>

<p class="fst">We can begin with the most depressing case, the notorious Emil
Ludwig <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Knowledge of the German character might have prevented
World War II ... National character is a genuine reality; it is the
sum total of the traits which distinguish a nation as a whole &#8211;
even though some of these traits may be absent in individual members.</p>

<p class="fst">We are then told that the Germans are eternally dissatisfied, they
crave power, but at the same time their ambition is to obey; they are
inclined to harshness, do not know love of liberty, and have a
mystical urge for expansion.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Germans had so long escaped a sense of personal
inferiority through refuge in self-identification with the state that
it became necessary psychologically to deny the defeat of 1918. This
created a political situation in which effective resistance to a
policy of revision or revenge was impossible and to which the logical
conclusion was Lidice. In perpetrating such crimes, the individual
feels himself an organ of the state. To be an efficient state organ
means much more to him than to be a valuable individual. The German
kills any neighbor he feels superior to ... Believing in his moral
right coolly and without emotion, he brings death to others and, if
need be, to himself.</p>

<p class="fst">Ludwig&#8217;s is the typical vulgarization of the entire problem; all
Germans are Nazis, all are guilty, all have possessed these traits
from time immemorial. The German people are born with these
personality characteristics full-blown. This is a return to old
theories of the immutability of human nature. Modern psychological
theory tells us that individuals are born with certain
potentialities, that the environment determines the degree to which
these may be attained, that there is constant interaction between
individual and environment and it is this interaction which
determines behavior. But this does not interest Ludwig; his only
concern is to indulge in hysterical and mystical chauvinism. Ludwig
is the crudest of his school, but there are others who, if more
subtle, are equally vicious. One such is Raoul De Sales <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The German has two characters; as an individual he is
kindly, but in the mass he is brutal. It is with the &#8220;<em>Volk</em>&#8221;
that the rest of the world has to deal. Germanism in its most
positive manifestations is one of the most dangerous forms of human
destructiveness that history has known. Hitler is the last phase of
an evolution toward total evil which has been pursued under the
various incarnations of the primitive Teutonic tribe, the German
concept of the state, Prussian militarism and the nation of <em>Volk</em>
for several centuries.</p>

<p class="fst">De Sales&#8217; description is simply incredible; it postulates a
Jekyll and Hyde, theory in which the individual and society lead a
kind of dualistic parallel existence but never meet or interact. Yet
it seems incongruous that the &#8220;<em>Volk</em>&#8221; aspect of German
character asserted by De Sales should not ultimately affect the
individual German &#8211; and there you have Ludwig&#8217;s theory. This
schizophrenic duality is given to German character as a means of
trying to escape Ludwig&#8217;s crass chauvinism, as a means of
projecting a national character for the <em>Volk</em> apart from the
observable characteristics of individual Germans. But the attempt
fails for the two cannot exist in isolation; the one must influence
the other and De Sales must end up in the camp of Ludwig.</p>

<p>If these theories were truly descriptive of the German people,
Hitler would have needed no concentration camps, no Gestapo, no
immense propaganda agency. no intensive education of the young, no
book-burning. The whole people would have been prepared to follow his
party from the start. These writers urge upon us a doctrine of racial
discrimination and attempt to persuade us that German fascism is a
peculiarly German phenomena. We are to forget the international
nature of fascism in the comfortable conviction that such ideas
flourish only in the &#8220;German mind.&#8221; Completely forgotten is the
role of the German working class. Why should fascism have paralyzed
proletarian resistance, destroyed the independent unions and stamped
out every vestige of the class struggle from its own &#8220;labor&#8221;
organizations if it did not fear the threat of the powerful class
sentiments and socialist aspirations of the, workers? If all Germans
are such singularly savage and amoral beings, why this dissidence?</p>

<p>From Seydowitz&#8217;s <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> description of <strong>Civil Life in Wartime
Germany</strong>, we learn how terror held the army and the home front
together during the war years. Seydowitz shows that after six years
of concentrated terror and propaganda to prepare the German people
for war &#8220;the lethargy of the masses at the beginning of the war
disproved the frequent and vociferous assertions that the German
nation stood unitedly behind its Fuehrer. Even at the time of
Hitler&#8217;s greatest successes, the major part of the people stood
aloof from Hitler&#8217;s <em>volksgemeinschaft</em>, assuming either a
passively waiting or indifferent attitude or one that was downright
hostile ... experience had taught the masses that even the most
striking victories seemed unable to restore peace.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Liberal Interpretation</h4>

<p class="fst">By contrast, the writings of two liberals, Hamilton Fyfe and
George Soule, though often naive, are on this matter comparatively
sane and rational. The former, though his approach is journalistic,
has some interesting things to say: According to Fyfe <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>,</p>

<p class="quoteb">... national characters are not distinct, homogeneous,
well-defined. A nation is not a natural unit like a herd of buffalos
... the nationality of large numbers has often been changed. A great
deal if not all the trouble in Europe is the result of people
everywhere being taught by rulers and newspapers to distrust one
another: to suppose their interests clash with those of their
neighbors; to regard these neighbors as inferior, presumptuous,
unfriendly. All of that teaching is based on the delusion that
nations have different characters and one forgetfulness of the fact
that when we speak of a &#8220;country&#8221; we mean the rulers of the country.</p>

<p class="quote">Having won the leadership of other elements in the
population, the Prussians have contributed most to the common belief
as to German qualities and characteristics ... What was glorified in
Germany during the short existence of the German Empire under the
Hohenzollerns was the personality of the ruler ... Yet so little
could the Kaiser influence the country&#8217;s political life that the
largest party in the Reichstag was the Social-Democrats, and so
little did the nation identify itself with him that in 1918 he was
told to go. It would be unjust to pretend that all Germans are guilty
alike. The course of national action is set by a few; they persuade
or compel a nation to follow. Vast numbers have been deluded, others
terrified into support of Hitler.</p>

<p class="fst">Fyfe&#8217;s is a healthy, questioning approach and gives some idea of
the German national character, but it is simplistic and suggestive
rather than concrete and integrative. It is true, as Fyfe says, that
rulers are identified with national character. Yet he disregards
totally the concept of class structure and is, we think, wrong in his
implicit rejection of national character. George Soule <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>, on this
matter more sophisticated, writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The common observations about the German herd spirit and
Hitler&#8217;s ruthless drive to power are true enough but not
sufficiently scientific in so far as they posit the existence of
something in the German character which does not exist in some
variety or other among other peoples as well; and to the extent that
they assume that Hitler is a unique individual whose counterpart
could not be found elsewhere under some other form. After all,
fascism conquered in other countries than Germany, and though the
Nazi movement brought to its finest flower the destructive forces of
the human personality, traces of the same cruelties, exaggerated
attitudes, and will to brutal conquest may be discovered in many
parts of the world and in many situations of less moment.</p>

<p class="quote">It would be a mistake to suppose that there are not many
kinds of Germans, or that they all, through the decades, have been
subject to the same kind of upbringing. Yet there is generally
recognized, especially in the Prussian tradition, a certain hard and
authoritative attitude which is observable not only in public
institutions but in family mores. The father is usually the dominant
parent, and he is traditionally severe. This type of family
organization, with its continuity through many generations, has
doubtless left its mark on the national character which has often in
the past been noted in the army and the state ... A background of
insecurity has also left its mark on German culture. The short
history of unity, long after other great nations of Europe achieved
theirs, predisposed Germans to overvalue the national state as a
unifying force and as a way of compensating for the inferiority long
felt as newcomers.</p>

<p class="fst">The versions of national character promulgated by Soule and Fyfe
are obviously more tempered analyses and help us discern the
intricacies of a perplexing array of opinion. Especially helpful is
the emphasis upon the cultural indoctrination of patrimonial traits
in early childhood, for we know that the structure of the adult
personality is based on early experiences. The common weakness of
writers such as Fyfe and Soule is that they fail to consider class
relationships and stratifications within society as determinants of
character traits; they do not consider the role of economic and
political factors in their interrelationships, nor the dynamic role
of conscious classes and individuals in effecting change. As a result
they cannot rise above the merely descriptive level; they are welcome
antidotes to the Vansittartism of people like Ludwig and De Sales,
but they do not themselves provide satisfactory answers to either the
problem of fascism or of national character.</p>

<p>The concept of national character, however, necessarily contains
psychological ingredients as well as political, and if this review of
typical spokesmen for the official world of thought has not proven
satisfying, perhaps the practitioners of the psychiatric approach
have more to offer. Here we find the equivalents of Ludwig using a
new jargon but the same ideas.</p>

<p>According to Frederick Schuman <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a>, Nazism is a psychological
malady with which the German post-war middle-class was afflicted.</p>

<p class="quoteb">In the program of the Nazi Party it found solace for all
its woes, forgiveness for all its sins, justification for all its
hatreds, scapegoats for all misfortunes, and a millennial vision of
all its hopes.</p>

<p class="fst">Elucidating this collective neurosis, Schuman runs the gamut of
Freudian concepts. The discontent of the lower middle class he
attributes to a denial of satisfying expression of the &#8220;id-drives,&#8221;
and aggressiveness, to a weakened &#8220;superego&#8221; with the result that
sin becomes fashionable. Nationalism is traced to a &#8220;castration&#8221;
phobia arising from World War I, which &#8220;brought about the
amputation of various parts of the Fatherland and its reduction to
impotence.&#8221; The prevailing opposition to the Weimar Republic is
explained by the fact that it offered neither adequate &#8220;mother
symbols&#8221; nor &#8220;father symbols.&#8221; The conciliatory policy of the
Weimar regime was distasteful to a castrated and impotent patriotism
which had need of the &#8220;phallic symbol&#8221; of the bloody sword as an
emblem of recovered strength. The so-called popular acceptance of
Hitler&#8217;s leadership is interpreted as the most complete expression
of &#8220;the pathological regression to infantilism&#8221; of the lower
middle class.</p>

<p class="quoteb">If the neurotic burgher could not quite return to the
dark unconsciousness and the complete security of the unborn foetus
in the womb, he could at least become once more a little child, his
whole life controlled for him by a stern and loving father.</p>

<p class="fst">Schuman&#8217;s argument has a deceptive ring; he fails to offer any
evidence for the presence of the Freudian clinical symptoms which are
well-defined for purposes of individual psychology but which are
merely analogical and verbal substitutions when applied to social
groups. As an example of what is meant by analogical verbal
substitutions, consider his equation of nationalism with a castration
complex. A nationalistic German would be emotionally aroused by the
loss of territory suffered as a result of the Versailles Treaty. This
territory has been cut off from Germany. The term &#8220;cut off&#8221; is
analogous to &#8220;castration.&#8221; Result: Schuman&#8217;s equation of
national feeling with the &#8220;castration phobia,&#8221; even though there
is nothing in the nationalist feeling to indicate the characteristic
symptoms of the castration complex as clinically observed. A similar
substitution is made by equating Hitler&#8217;s bloody sword to the
phallic symbol. Such reasoning, involving substitutions from one
intellectual discipline to another, unrelated one, can only be
described as slipshod and dangerous.</p>

<p>A less Freudian but more circumspect interpretation is furnished
by Richard Brickner <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>, who has submitted a plan to the State
Department aiming to change the &#8220;German character.&#8221; His diagnosis
that the German people have been suffering for more than a century
from a had case of &#8220;psychocultural aggression.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">German institutions have bred into the individual German
an aggressive concern for his &#8220;status.&#8221; In the family, the father
has long been absolute master. Business, education and politics have
likewise been ruled by an authoritarian system in which to assert and
defend his status, the German alternately commands and scrapes.
Unlike Americans and Englishmen, who consider it unsporting to exert
their full strength against weaker opponents, (!&nbsp;!&nbsp;!)
Germans are traditionally more brutal and ruthless toward their
inferiors. In their relations with other nations, they have been
alternately arrogant and afflicted with a persecution complex, a
condition resembling paranoia. What distinguishes the Germans is not
their aggressiveness alone, but the megalomania, suspiciousness,
feeling of persecution, projection, complex rationalization,
retrospective falsification, sense of mission, exaggeration, and,
above all, the total irrationality with which that aggression is
manifested. Germany&#8217;s unremitting insistence on claims of &#8220;unjust
treatment,&#8221; &#8220;encirclement,&#8221; &#8220;need of living space,&#8221; etc.,
coupled with their martyr phraseology makes them appear typical and
by definition, insatiable paranoid demands.</p>

<p class="fst">From this diagnosis, Brickner deduced that it would be useless
merely to preach democracy to the German people; they are emotionally
unable to understand the democratic principle of give and take, and
cooperation among equals.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Nazism is merely the current expression of a paranoid
trend which has existed for over a hundred years. Although the trend
is cultural, it has the same implications as of the individual paranoic.</p>

<p class="fst">Here we witness the strange spectacle of paranoiac behavior
without a neuro-psychological basis; a whole population behaves as do
individual paranoics, yet is not affiicted with paranoia. What then
is the origin of this strange affliction?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Psychiatry and Social Phenomena</h4>

<p class="fst">Schuman&#8217;s and Brickner&#8217;s interpretations of German character
are faulty in the misapplication to social phenomena of psychiatric
terms originally intended only for individual analysis. Psychiatric
concepts are concepts of individual psychology. If we apply them to
institutions and collective behavior without concerning ourselves
with clinical symptoms or the neurological basis which they imply, we
do not provide very much illumination. Our ability to understand, to
predict and to control is derived from our knowledge of causes;
argument by analogy is no substitute for causal analysis. Analogies
from individual psychology to social behavior have value only insofar
as it is always understood that they are merely analogies.</p>

<p>Also implied in the theses of Schuman and Brickner is the
assumption of a collective personality which can be described in
terms of individual personal disorder. It is our belief that groups
and classes in society do not have a personality structure in any
sense equivalent to that of an individual personality structure. The
character and mode of functioning of a group in society is not merely
the result of the sum of, the character and functioning of its
individual members; the group has an autonomous existence. Social
factors are seen to be caused by antecedent social factors and cannot
be referred back to individual characteristics.</p>

<p>In addition, the author&#8217;s Freudian orientation precludes a
complete understanding of cultural and social factors and their
interaction with the individual in society, for Freud&#8217;s system is
in the main instinctualist and thereby prey to &#8220;human nature&#8221;
theories. Freud and the earlier psychoanalysts carried on their
investigations entirely within the frame of European culture and
largely within that of a single class in European society. Lacking
comparative materials. they took many environmental factors for
granted and built up an elaborate theory of universal human
instincts. The various attempts which were made by Freud and others
to apply this instinctualist approach to the explanation of cultural
phenomena were not successful. Thus while recognizing his outstanding
insights into human motivation we do not agree with the Freudian
notion that man is inherently wicked and aggressive and that,
therefore wars are inevitable. An important implication of recent
psychological findings is that traits like aggressiveness or
submissiveness are not instinctual, innate or universal and therefore
cannot be spoken of in terms of &#8220;national&#8221; attributes permeating
the whole of a population. Nor can anyone trait like aggressiveness
for instance, ever reveal all about an individual or group.
Individuals are complex organisms; groups are more so. Aggression may
merely be one of a constellation of traits. Even when dominant it may
have varying underlying motivations. It has different meanings and
serves different functions according to the needs of the individual
and group in a particular situation. It may be a response to
frustration, simply a means of securing safety. or may embody other
meanings. People may be aggressive in one situation and not at all in another.</p>

<p>One final point needs to be made against the Schuman-Brickner
approach. Both of them implicitly accept Freud&#8217;s dictum that
&#8220;sociology which deals with the behavior of man in society, can be
nothing other than applied psychology.&#8221; (<strong>New Introductory
Lectures</strong>) The acceptance of this idea, if logically developed,
undermines any scientific approach to history or society; it makes of
politics and history merely sub-branches of psychoanalysis. We
believe rather in an approach which focuses attention first of all on
historical processes, on aspects of social structure and group mores
as clues to causal factors.</p>

<h4 class="western">* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">There still remains a group of scholars who have attempted to
relate historical, cultural and psychological approaches. Two such
writers, Abram Kardiner and Erich Fromm make interesting contributions.</p>

<p>Kardiner <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a>, combining anthropological and psychoanalytic
techniques in his study of the reciprocal relations between culture
and personality chose the term &#8220;basic personality structure&#8221; to
obviate the lack of clarity in the terms group. national or social
character. This is an attempt to apply to cultures a psychoanalytic
approach modified by a realization of the important part played by
social factors in determining psychological phenomena. The &#8220;basic
personality structure&#8221; for any society &#8220;represents the
constellation of personality characteristics congenial with the total
range of institutions comprised within a given culture.&#8221; It is
that&#8217; personality configuration shared by the bulk of the society&#8217;s
members. as a result of the early experiences which they have in
common and need not correspond to the total personality of the
individual. No one individual is ever familiar with the whole of the
culture in which he participates nor does he express all its patterns
in his own behavior. The constellations identified in &#8220;basic
personality structure&#8221; are not finished personality traits but the
matrix in which such traits develop. In general the concept
represents that which differentiates the personalities of members of
two different cultural communities. Kardiner has also tried to
discover not only what the basic personality types were in the
various cultures studied but also how they were produced and what
influence they exerted on the culture itself. These dynamic features
are an integral part of the concept.</p>

<p>The &#8220;cultural approach&#8221; has enormous significance in the
attempt to understand the diversity of human cultures and the
plasticity and potentialities of human nature everywhere. it is most
meaningful when applied to simpler, primitive cultures which tend to
have a unity, a pattern and an organic wholeness of a kind. In such
homogeneous cultures one feature may become predominant in all
institutions and individual functions. This kind of approach,
however, often results in a mere amassing of facts where all facets
of the culture are given equal weight; it is superficial and
misleading when applied to the more complex patterns of western
society. Through their findings, anthropologists are led to question
many of the institutions of modern society, conclude that &#8220;we must
re-examine our basic institutions,&#8221; but go no further.</p>

<p>According to Kardiner then, no matter in what form and with what
qualifications we use his concept of &#8220;basic personality structure&#8221;
as a means of historical interpretation, we do away with a constant
human nature which can be counted upon to behave in a uniform manner
under all conditions. One need not agree with any particular estimate
of the value of Kardiner&#8217;s theory to realize that it is at least
scientifically permissible in approach, that it attempts to
investigate precisely those problems which others take for granted as
premises. Similarly with the writings of Erich Fromm <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>, who tells
us that to understand the dynamics of the social process,</p>

<p class="quoteb">... we must understand the dynamics of the psychological
processes operating within the individual, just as to understand the
individual we must see him in the context of the culture which molds
him ... Freedom, though it brought man independence and rationality,
has made him isolated and thereby anxious and powerless. This
isolation is unbearable and the alternatives he is confronted with
are either to escape from the burden of this freedom into new
dependencies and submission, or to advance to the full realization of
positive freedom which is based upon the uniqueness and individuality
of man.</p>

<p class="quote">Nazism is an economic and political problem, but the hold
it has over a whole people has to be understood on psychological
grounds. What we are concerned with is this psychological aspect of
Nazism, its human basis. This suggests two problems: the character
structure of those people to whom it appealed, and the psychological
characteristics of the ideology that made it such an effective
instrument with regard to those very people.</p>

<p class="fst">In considering the psychological basis for the success of Nazism,
Fromm makes this differentiation: that one part of the population
bowed to the Nazi regime without any strong resistance, but also
without becoming admirers of the Nazi ideas &#8211; there were the
working class, the liberals and Catholics. This readiness to submit
is explained as mainly due to a state of inner tiredness and
resignation. Another part was deeply attracted to the new ideology
and fanatically attached to those who proclaimed it &#8211; these were
the lower strata of the middle class, composed of small shopkeepers,
artisans and white-collar workers. The reason why the Nazi ideology
was so appealing to them is to be sought in their social character,
their love of the strong and hatred of the weak; their pettiness,
hostility and thriftiness with feelings as well as with money. Their
outlook on life was narrow, they suspected and hated the stranger,
and they were curious and envious of their acquaintances,
rationalizing their envy as moral indignation; economically as well
as psychologically their life was based on the principle of scarcity.
The event that took place after 1914 intensified the very traits to
which the Nazis had its strong appeal: the craving for submission and
the lust for power.</p>

<p>Hitler&#8217;s personality, his teachings and the Nazi system express
an extreme form of the &#8220;authoritarian character,&#8221; the personality
structure of which is the human basis of fascism and by this very
fact, he made a powerful appeal to those parts of the population
which were more or less of the same character structure. The essence
of the authoritarian structure is described as the simultaneous
presence of sadistic and masochistic drives, the craving for power
over men and the longing for submission. Everyone thus has somebody
above him to submit to and somebody beneath him to dominate. (This is
somewhat akin to the anti-Semitism of some Negroes.)</p>

<p>Fromm believes there should be positive freedom, which consists of
the &#8220;spontaneous activity of the total, integrated personality.&#8221;
We are to achieve this <em>desideratum</em> through &#8220;democratic socialism
wherein the irrational, planless character of society must be
replaced by a planned economy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fromm&#8217;s description utilizes Marxian concepts with some success.
He fails of course to state how his society is to be achieved. Before
individuals can become &#8220;productive and spontaneous&#8221; they must
first overthrow the society they live in and construct a socialist
society. Fromm is not correct in stating that the working class
showed no strong resistance to Hitler. His theory of an
&#8220;authoritarian character&#8221; as the basis for fascism is
unconvincing. His discussion of the role of the middle classes in
supporting Hitler is credible; yet the middle class, torn between two
extremes, always follows the party offering the most militant
program. In Germany, profoundly discontented with their condition,
they turned to Hitler because the working class leadership did not
show itself capable of leading the struggle. No doubt a number of
clashing interests and certain antipathies separated them from the
organized proletariat but these contlicts would have been surmounted
if the revolutionary proletariat had opened up for them an escape
from their misery. While Fromm thus clarifies somewhat the meaning of
national character and social forces, he neglects the overwhelming
importance of historical factors &#8211; of economic political forces, of
classes and parties.</p>

<p>Both Fromm and Kardiner display imaginative and challenging
approaches to the relationship between the individual and society.
Because of various common modes of development and though due to
intercommunication, cultural diffusion and other generally similar
factors found in western society, they properly choose to speak of
the character structure of &#8220;western man&#8221; instead of specific
national or racial groups; this of course includes the specific local
variations to be found everywhere.</p>

<p>Since the world is divided into nations, each with a typical
cultural and historical background, national characteristics among
nations differ, as individuals interact with their respective
environments. Similarly are there differences and variations within a
particular nation: economic, regional, religious, etc. Thus there are
mores common to the whole of a nation and there are those common only
to sub-groups. And within this sub-group individual differences
exist. In human behavior &#8211; individual, group or national &#8211; there
is much variation, much unity and much diversity. This must be
understood in a specific context &#8211; the cultural historical matrix.</p>

<p>German &#8220;national character&#8221; is seen as a much maligned and
vastly misunderstood concept, which in its contaminated form is
strategically projected from time to time, whenever it serves the
interests of the powers that be.</p>
