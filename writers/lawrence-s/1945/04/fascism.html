<p class="fst">Despite the popular belief that fascism is a collective madness
peculiar to certain evil nations abroad, it should be recognized by
every anti-fascist that the seeds of fascism are inherent in every
capitalist country. Although there are differences in form, the
content of American fascism is the same as that of Europe, in that
fascism in reality serves big-business interests, although
masquerading as anti-capitalist. That this has been amply borne out
is evident when we consider some of the native and ill-assorted,
anti-labor and anti-democratic movements which have flourished here,
variously headed by such saviors of democracy as:<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Some &#8220;Rabblerousers&#8221;</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>W. Lee O&#8217;Daniel</strong>, former president of the Hillbilly
Flour Company and the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, recently
elected senator of Texas and now head of the Christian American
Association which has succeeded in adding several anti-labor laws to
various state constitutions.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Father Coughlin</strong>, whose crusade against Wall St. was
in part subsidized by certain Wall St. silver speculators.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><em><strong>Gene Talmadge</strong>, who led the Atlanta &#8220;Grass
Roots&#8221; conferences, a gathering of Southern farmers and smalltown
folks, financed by such rustics are Pierre duPont, Ogden Mills, and
several executives of General Motors, National Steel, etc.</em><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Huey Long</strong>, who had intimate connections With
Standard Oil of Louisiana and was on the way to spreading the
crackpot &#8220;share-the-wealth&#8221; gospel.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Gerald L.K. Smith</strong>, head of the America Firsters, who
can boast as one of his financial backers Harry Bennett, former head
of the Ford Co. service squad, now a vice-president and reputed to
be running the Ford empire.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h4>Reynolds&#8217; Party</h4>
<p class="fst">The most recent fascist threat to American labor and the people as
a whole is the formation of the Nationalist Party, by the
rabble-rousing ex-Senator Robert Rice Reynolds (famed for his
isolationist policies), who broke with Gerald L.K. Smith&#8217;s America
First Party. His ostensible aim is the creation of a mass party of
Jim Crowers, anti-Semitic, anti-foreign-born people, and anti-labor
elements, which abound in the country, with the goal of establishing
a totalitarian fascist state in America.</p>
<p>Designed as a catch-all to combine numbers of the fascist &#8220;lunatic
fringe&#8221; with the money and prestige of big business, the
Nationalist Party is busily organizing secret cells in New York City.
Operating thus far on a small and underground scale, about fifty
secret cells or &#8220;units&#8221; have been set up in the five boroughs,
especially in Queens and Brooklyn, where membership in a unit is
limited to ten persons.</p>
<p>It has been reported, however, that an expansion of Nationalist
Party organizational activity appears likely, for Reynolds who has
been vacationing at his Florida estate, is due back at his Washington
headquarters shortly, and &#8220;big things&#8221; are predicted upon his
return. At least five important pro-fascist outfits in New York City
have joined the motley crew.</p>
<p>The Nationalist Party is the result of the fusion of
two other Reynolds&#8217; fronts, the American Nationalist Committee, and
the Nationalist Confederation.</p>
<p><em>Reynolds also boasts a private, potential storm-troop outfit,
the Vindicators, and a newspaper, the <strong>National Record</strong>.
He has indicated that the Nationalist Party will come out in the open
with public meetings, distribution of literature, etc., on July 4 of
this year. By then he hopes to have at least one unit in every
Congressional District in the country. With the end of the war in
sight, the Nationalists believe that now is the time to build a party
which can exploit the resentments produced by casualty lists and the
wounds of thousands of demobilized soldiers.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A Big Business Weapon</h4>
<p class="fst">That fascism is synonymous with all that is reactionary,
retrogressive and corrupt in society is quite clear and leads to but
one conclusion: fascism can be fought only by militant, working-class
action. If the workers depend upon the reformist labor leaders, they
will suffer defeat, because the reformists represent the interests
not of the workers, but of so-called &#8220;liberal&#8221; capitalism, and
when it comes to a showdown, &#8220;liberal&#8221; capitalism simply drops
the adjective. It protests, but is powerless since it does not know
how to fight fascism.</p>
<p>We have as yet no strong labor party to counterpose a genuine
labor program for the people against the inroads of the fascists, but
we do have the lessons of the past decade to guide us. We have
learned that big business, in order to survive, maintains the fascist
gangs merely as anti-labor militia at first, whose job is simply to
terrorize and demoralize the workers&#8217; organizations. They help
break strikes, beat up and murder the workers&#8217; leaders, wreck union
offices and left wing newspaper plants. As capitalist crisis
intensifies, big business finds that this is not enough and launches
its fascist troops toward the conquest of state power.</p>
<p><em>Thus labor must organize the fight against fascism. It must
organize its own Defense Guards to be ready fop the fascist violence.
It must organize an independent Labor Party based on the unions, to
bring about the victory of a genuine working class program.</em></p>
