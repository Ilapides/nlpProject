<p class="fst">THE entire dispute over trusteeships at the San Francisco
Conference is definitely only another part of the game of power
politics. The recent maneuverings among the Big Five, about whether
to use &#8220;independence&#8221; or &#8220;self-determination&#8221; as an objective
for the dependent colonial peoples, to be stated in the preamble to
the trusteeship section of the global charter, is only so much
surface covering to deflect attention from the intense rivalries for
markets, territories, bases, and profits among the Five.</p>
<p>What is the controversy concerning whether or not &#8220;independence&#8221;
for colonial peoples shall be written into the new trusteeship
chapter of the UNCIO&#8217;s (United Nations Conference on International
Organization) charter? The matter of eventual independence for
now-dependent peoples has been characterized by the failure of the
United States and English delegations to back it up thus far at
sessions of the United Nations Conference Committee on
Trusteeships.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>&#8220;Self-Government&#8221; Myth</h4>
<p class="fst">The independence issue has been sidetracked by substituting the
idea of &#8220;self-government in forms appropriate to the varying
circumstances of each territory.&#8221; What was originally merely a
draft of a &#8220;working paper,&#8221; drawn up by Commander Stassen and
others of the American delegation, and accepted by the Committee only
as a basis for discussion, has now been high-handedly adopted as the
future policy, through American pressure.</p>
<p><em>It becomes brutally clear that this poorly camouflaged scheme
is an outright bid for control of colonies, on the part of the
Allies. Dr. Wellington Koo of China protested feebly at this action
and originally urged at one of the meetings, that, in line with the
progressive ideas on political advancement set forth in China&#8217;s own
proposals as to trusteeships, the word &#8220;independence&#8221; be added&#8221;
to, or substituted for, &#8220;self-government.&#8221; A.A. Rostchen,
representing Russia, defended Koo&#8217;s position. Lord Cranborne,
British Dominions Secretary, argued against use of the word
&#8220;independence,&#8221; saying that a lot of dependent peoples didn&#8217;t
aspire to independence, even if they could achieve it. Stassen gave
this display of concern for the colonies the crowning, final touch
when lie cynically explained that his view is not independence, but
inter-dependence among nations, and that &#8220;all nations must learn to
live together&#8221; &#8211; a very pretty sentiment indeed, and meaning
absolutely nothing, except that, what the U.S. says, goes.</em></p>
<p>As if it mattered which word to use, when the motives of all are
alike. Now it appears that the Chinese delegation has been forced to
agree, for they have withdrawn their proposal to insert the word
&#8220;independence&#8221; for &#8220;self-determination.&#8221; And the Russians who
originally sided with them now too accept the Anglo-American plan on
instructions from Moscow.</p>
<p>We most emphatically do not think the trusteeship system will
offer &#8220;real opportunity for progress to dependent peoples.&#8221; The
professed peace and post-war sentiments of the San Francisco
Delegations cannot be realized in the arena of imperialist power
politics.</p>
<p>Nobody seems to think that the colonial peoples themselves have
anything to say about the achievement of their national independence.
Instead, the Security Council is going to see that these objectives
are to be carried out so they should not interfere with the retention
and development, on the part of the great powers, of strategic areas
and bases.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Imperialist Record</h4>
<p class="fst">Let us examine the fine records of these &#8220;friends&#8221; of the
colonials and their inter-imperialist rivalries. The British, for
example, have promised the Indian people independence many times,
have made speeches about it in Parliament, have sent special
committees to India, and busied themselves with other ineffectual
measures, but at the same time, have continued to imprison the
leaders of the colonial peoples of India and elsewhere fighting for
independence.</p>
<p><em>Britain, and to a still greater degree France, have been
weakened by the war. Keeping and exploiting the colonies is a life
and death concern to them. They oppose anyone else moving in on their
territory, and are frightened, for there are others who eye their
rich colonies in Africa, the Near East, and Asia enviously,
especially the U.S.</em></p>
<p>The U.S. has been using the trusteeship formula from the beginning
as a means of broadening the degree of its economic penetration of
the world. That means penetrating the colonial empires of Great
Britain, France, Holland, Portugal and Belgium.</p>
<p>Russia, too, is added to the many friends of the colonials. Why
should Russia be so concerned about colonial self-determination and
national independence? It has not even offered the people of Poland,
Bulgaria, Romania, and the Baltic countries the right to determine
their own forms of government and to free them from the control of
the Stalinist bureaucracy, but instead continues to repress
ruthlessly all socialist or radical expression.</p>
<p>The problem of the colonies is a crucial one for the Allies, for
the war has developed strong movements for national independence and
freedom.</p>
<p>After all, why should the Allies emancipate these colonies that
have been deprived freedom for so long by their masters? None of the
powers can really be interested in the freedom of the colonies, for
the colonies are an intrinsic part of the capitalist structure of
exploitation and imperialism. From the colonies are derived cheap
labor and cheap raw materials.</p>
<p><em>The struggle of the exploited peoples in the colonies is only
part of the greater struggle of all humanity to achieve freedom and
equality. The peoples in the colonies will develop the powerful
forces existing in their own countries and realize that their
interests are identical With the workers of all countries. But, in
turn, the workers of other countries must recognize this affinity of
need and interest. No alliances among any of the powers can serve as
a substitute.</em></p>
