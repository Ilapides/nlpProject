<p class="fst"><strong>The Worker in an Affluent Society</strong><br />
F. Zweig<br />
<em>Heinemann, 25s.</em></p>

<p class="fst">Mr. Zweig is inexhaustible. This, the latest of his surveys of the condition of the working-class, is more refined in its techniques of study than was his celebrated Pelican of a few years ago: but even though it has its selection of tables scattered (at random ?) through the text, the interpretation to which these are subjected is as idiosyncratic as ever. There <em>are</em> useful things in the book: the section on shift-work, for instance, or even the one on housekeeping allowances; but the general picture is fogged, cramped, botched. Mr. Zweig seems to be blinded by the brightness of his own light, which perhaps helps to explain why there isn&#8217;t much of it left to point a way through the gloom for the rest of us.</p>

<p>A sample of the finesse with which Mr. Zweig&#8217;s mounds of completed questionnaires are treated will show something of the theoretical quality of his work: &#8216;In the five works I visited I could say that there was very little sign of what is often called the &#8220;alienation&#8221; of the workman from his work ...&#8217; we are told on page 69. On page 84, we follow on: &#8216;&#8220;Home and work don&#8217;t mix&#8221; this is a phrase which often circulates among working-men&#8217; ... and more, &#8216;Men would say: &#8220;I never mention work at home, otherwise I could never relax.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>On page 199 we are informed that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Often when I asked, &#8220;Do you like your job?&#8221; a generalisation was put forward such as &#8220;No one really likes his job&#8221;; or to a question, &#8220;Do you work only for money; does the job give you something else apart from money?&#8221; the answer might be, &#8220;We all work for money, there is nothing else in the job.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">At this point we may be forgiven for recollecting without surprise that on page 22 we had already learnt: &#8216;men rarely had ambitions for themselves, but a great deal of ambition for their children.&#8217;</p>

<p>You pays your penny, and you takes your choice (in library fines rather than bookshop bills, if you are wise).</p>
