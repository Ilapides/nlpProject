<h1>Tyne Strike</h1>

<h3>(October 1945)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Appeal Supplement</strong>, Mid-October 1945, p.&nbsp;2.<br/>
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">The employers&#8217; vicious policy of nibbling at the rights of the
workers has caused a strike of workers employed in the fitting shop
of the <em>Shipbuilding Corporation, Walker-on-Tyne</em>. The
management, contrary to the provisions of the E.W.O., on and after
September 3rd locked out all men at 7.45&nbsp;a.m. for the whole day.</p>

<p>A mass meeting of the workers in the Yard was held immediately
following the lock-out and unanimously it condemned this arbitrary
action of the management. As a result of this strong protest the
management informed the men that they could start at 1 o&#8217;clock
mid-day, by first seeking the permission of the foreman. This offer
was rightly rejected; because such a procedure could only be
calculated to victimise militant workers, who already were unpopular
with the foremen.</p>

<p><em>Brother Tate</em>, Shop Steward in the Fitting Department,
approached the A.E.U. District Organiser asking for assistance to
defend the rights of the workers. <em>He was told by the District
Organiser, that: the strike must remain the responsibility of the
rank and file strikers.</em> The <em>District Committee</em>, pursuing
the same policy as the Organiser, used every method possible to evade
the Strike Committee. Only after persistent efforts had been made did
the men finally succeed in stating their case and presenting their
facts to the D.C. &#8211; only to be cross questioned and told to retire ...</p>

<p>The Strike Committee realising the importance of the issue at
stake has issued a Statement and an appeal for moral and financial
support to the Works Convenors and Shop Stewards of all Tyneside
Yards. Certain Convenors and Stewards are trying to break the back of
the strike by withholding the facts and appeals for support from the
men.</p>

<p>The rank and file Fitters are asking: whose side are the union
officials on? They see that their struggle against the attacks of the
employers is also a struggle against the attacks of the employers is
also a struggle against a union leadership[ which refuses to defend
the elementary rights of the workers. The immediate call of the
Strike Committee to all Shop Stewards and sincere trade unionists is:</p>

<p class="c"><strong>Call Shop Stewards Meetings on This Question!<br/>
Organise Shop Collections!<br/>
Support the Strikers</strong></p>

<p class="fst">The Strike Committee request that all monies should be sent to:</p>
