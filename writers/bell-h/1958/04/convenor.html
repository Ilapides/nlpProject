<h4>Newcastle</h4>

<p class="fst">Employers all over the country are using the developing recession
as a means of ridding themselves of convenors, shop stewards, and any
militants prepared to defend standards and conditions.</p>

<p>In the years since the war, under boom conditions and subject to
constant working-class pressure through these same militants, the
employers were forced into certain grudging concessions. Now reports
are coming in from all parts of the country &#8211; Newcastle, Sheffield,
London, Glasgow &#8211; of workers being compelled to take strike action
to defend shop organisation and prevent the victimisation of militants.</p>

<p>At Armstrong-Whitworth (Pneumatic Tools) Limited in North Shields,
the management dismissed the convenor, Bro. Albert Ogle, in
connection with a dispute about &#8220;machine-washing.&#8221; This is
normally a job done by labourers; but in an attempt to dispense with
unskilled labour, the employers tried to force semi-skilled and even
skilled men to do this work, thereby depriving the labourers of their employment.</p>

<p>The cleaning materials supplied, as the strike bulletin issued by
the workers declares, &#8220;consist of a bucket of chemical solution
(proved injurious to the skin) and the usual cotton waste.&#8221; A
skilled operator, instructed to do this work, objected and approached
the convenor. When the convenor complained to the management, he was
given a week&#8217;s notice.</p>

<p>This was on the Friday. On the following Monday, Bro. Ogle was
forcibly ejected from the shop &#8211; that is, before he had worked his
week&#8217;s notice. This was, obviously, against all accepted union
procedures and agreements. Incidentally, three convenors have been
dismissed in the past few years.</p>

<p>When the workers saw what was happening, they struck work
immediately and walked out of the factory. The strike was 100 per
cent. The union offered to negotiate on the basis of a return to work
with the convenor under a week&#8217;s notice. The management refused.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the management prosecuted the convenor for alleged
trespass. He was bound over for six months for alleged assault (in
trying to get in to the premises)! This despite the fact that, when
given notice, he had not been told that he should not return; this
was only pressed by the management on the Monday. His counter-summons
for assault was dismissed!<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Workers solid</h4>

<p class="fst">This has incensed the workers all the more, and they have remained
solid throughout the six weeks of the strike. This although only 140
workers are employed.</p>

<p>Labourers, skilled and semi-skilled are all involved; members of
the AEU, shipwrights, NUGMW, boilermarkers and ETU. After three
weeks, the strike was officially recognised.</p>

<p>A feature of the strike is that 14 women are involved, all out and
all in the union. They have participated in the strike meetings.
There has been unanimous endorsement and full support by the district
committee of the AEU. No pickets were necessary, and the whole
district has declared work at the factory black.</p>

<p>After six weeks, the management climbed down to the extent of
offering to take all the workers back on the basis of the convenor
working a week&#8217;s notice while negotiations proceeded. The workers
unanimously rejected this, and the unions have demanded the
unconditional reinstatement of Bro. Ogle and all the other workers.</p>

<p>The AEU is organising a ballot among the 28,000 engineers on
Tyneside on the question of the Armstrong-Whitworth strikers.</p>
