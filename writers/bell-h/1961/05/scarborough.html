<p class="fst">Dear Comrade,</p>

<p class="fst">It is becoming increasingly clear that the leadership of the
Parliamentary Party and a majority on the National Executive
Committee are determined to fight against the decisions of the
Scarborough Conference. The situation calls for a supreme effort on
the part of the rank and file in the Party and Trade Unions to resist
the Leadership on this issue. Unless we ensure that Conference is
accepted as the policy-making body of the Party, and insist that the
National Executive Committee and the Parliamentary Party carry out
this policy, then the whole future of the Party will be in jeopardy.</p>

<p>The Tyneside Committee, which is composed of active rank and file
members of the Party and has the support of prominent Party members
in the area, came into existence to rally support for this struggle.
Appended to this letter is a brief statement of aims. We hope that
you will agree to support the campaign by putting your signature to
the statement of aims and returning it to the address below.</p>
