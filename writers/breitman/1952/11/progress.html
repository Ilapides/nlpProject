<p class="fst">Two main camps, broadly speaking, are engaged in a
struggle for the leadership of the anti-Jim Crow movement in the United
States. One camp, temporarily dominant, stands for &#8220;gradual reform&#8221;
through class collaboration; it includes most labor and Negro leaders,
practically all capitalist liberals and some capitalist conservatives.
The other camp, whose direct influence is much weaker, stands for
radical change through militant class struggle; its chief organized
expression is the Marxist movement, although large numbers of Negroes
and workers sympathize with some or many of its practical conclusions.</p>
<p>The reformist camp takes this position:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We deplore Jim Crow and want to eliminate it. We
believe that this can be done, and should be done, within the framework
of capitalism and the two-party system. The way to achieve progress is
not by antagonizing those who control the country, but by persuading
them that Jim Crow is harmful, unjust and unnecessary. The facts show
that our approach is correct because the Negro has steadily been making
remarkable gains in all spheres of American life. Let us not become
impatient and throw away the method that has been tested and proved
successful. Let us continue to work as we have been doing, more
energetically of course, and through peaceful collaboration, appeals to
reason and willingness to compromise we will gradually but surely solve
the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The revolutionary camp takes this position:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The only way to make progress against Jim Crow is by
fighting tooth and nail against those who profit by it, the capitalist
class, just as the only way to end Jim Crow is by removing its
fundamental cause, the capitalist system. Whatever lasting gains the
Negro people have made in the 20th century were won through struggle in
alliance with other progressive sections of the population,
particularly the working class, and not by collaboration with the
capitalist beneficiaries of Jim Crow; and that is how future gains will
be made too. We deny that the economic gains of recent years are
substantial, or that they will necessarily be permanent, or that they
automatically signify further gains, or that they prove the correctness
of the reformist program To win the maximum gains possible under
capitalism, and to abolish Jim Crow, we need new methods, a new
leadership and a new party based on the labor and Negro movements.&#8221; <a
id="f1" href="#n1" name="f1" target="_blank" >[1]</a><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>New Bible for Reformers</h4>
<p class="fst">As can be seen, part of the controversy revolves around
the extent and nature of recent gains by the Negro people. Since the
end of World War II the reformists have talked about little else, for
this is their strongest debating point. Now they have a Bible too &#8212; a
report entitled <strong>Employment and Economic Status of Negroes in
the United States</strong>, prepared for the Senate Subcommittee on
Labor and Labor-Management Relations and published on Nov. 20, 1952.
The air has been thick since then with claims that need to be examined.</p>

<p>An introductory note in the report says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;From all the information brought together, two
general facts seem to emerge. The first is that in almost every
significant economic and social characteristic that we can measure &#8212;
including length of life, education, employment and income &#8212; our Negro
citizens, as a whole, are less well off than our white citizens. The
second is that in almost every characteristic the differences between
the two groups have narrowed in recent years.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">(The second, naturally, was selected for priority and
the main emphasis in the headlines, news stories and editorial comment
of most of the capitalist press.)</p>
<p>In our opinion, the first of these general conclusi6ns, whose truth
no one can deny, is the more important of the two. The program of
gradual reform has had 8% decades since the Civil War to show what it
can do and yet 1950 found the Negro &#8220;less well off&#8221; than the white &#8212;
and that is an extreme understatement, as the statistics will show.
Nevertheless, since the reformists claim that the decade 1940-50 marked
such an acceleration of Negro progress that their policies have been
vindicated, it is necessary to examine the statistics supplied in the
report with a view to determining what changes took place in the status
of the Negro people during that decade, and what their implications are
for the future. <a id="f2" href="#n2" name="f2" target="_blank" >[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">According to Table 1, the average wage of the employed
Negro rose from $364 in 1939 to $1,295 in 1950, an increase of $931.
This is less than the average increase of the employed white in the
same period, $1,525. But since the Negro&#8217;s wage in the base year (1939)
was so much lower than that of the white, his smaller increase in
dollars works out as a bigger increase in percentages. In 1939 the
Negro&#8217;s wage represented 38% of the white&#8217;s, in 1950 it represented
52%. Thus this table shows a relative gain of 14% for the Negro in the
period considered.</p>

<p>This 14% figure is the most impressive in the entire report. The
table on average life expectancy shows a relative gain of only 5% for
Negro men and 8% for Negro women in the last 30 years; the table on
education shows a relative gain of 6% for the Negro from 1940 to 1950;
and the tables on occupational status vary too much from industry to
industry and between the sexes to permit an exact estimation. <a
id="f4" href="#n4" name="f4" target="_blank" >[4]</a> Most of this article, therefore,
will be concerned with an evaluation of the maximum change hailed by
the reformists, the 14% figure on wage income.</p>
<p>Most of the comparisons in the report are between 1940 and 1950 &#8212; 10
years, not 11 as in the wage income table. This at once raises a
question: Why did the government statisticians omit the 1940 figures,
which are available, and use the 1939 figures instead? It may help us
to note here that if we compare the 10 year period 1939-49, we find a
relative gain of 7% &#8212; only one-half the gain shown for the 11 year
period. Could it be that a comparison of 1940 and 1950 &#8212; the standard
procedure in most of the tables, we repeat &#8212; would show a much less
imposing relative gain than the 14% shown for 1939-50? The compilers of
the report will have to answer that question. Meanwhile, we see how
greatly the final result can be changed by a slight alteration in the
years picked for comparison, and we should be put on our guard by the
arbitrariness of the choice made in this table.</p>
<p>That leads us directly to a much more basic objection: Comparisons
of this kind have only a limited value unless they are accompanied by
an understanding of the specific conditions that prevailed in the
different years compared. (How useful for example, are figures
comparing agricultural production in two different years if you don&#8217;t
know that one of them was a drought year?) We must know in what
respects the economic situation of 1939 resembled that of 1950, and in
what respects they differed. Otherwise we are in no position to
evaluate the 14% figure or the impression, fostered by the report, that
it establishes a general trend.</p>
<p>The 1930&#8217;s were the years of the great depression; despite some
relative recovery around the middle of the decade there was another
recession in 1937 and unemployment was still heavy in 1939 (averaging
9&frac12; million). It may be asked: What significance does that have
for our study &#8212; didn&#8217;t unemployment affect whites as well as Negroes?
Of course it did, but not proportionally &#8212; the percentage of
unemployment was much higher among Negroes. Then it may be asked: But
what difference does that make in considering Table 1, which gives
average incomes only of the employed? It makes plenty of difference:
The depression not only produced proportionally greater unemployment
among Negroes, it also reduced the average &#8220;income of those Negroes who
managed to get or keep jobs proportionally more than the income of
employed whites. This resulted from two factors: discrimination against
Negroes in hiring, and the depression-born practice of replacing
Negroes with whites in the better-paid of the so-called &#8220;Negro jobs.&#8221;
Thus we have good reason to believe that so far as income went, the
Negro was relatively, as well as absolutely, worse off in 1940 (or
1939) than he was in 1930.</p>
<p>Now we cannot prove that statistically because, for some reason, the
report does not give 1930 figures on Negro and white income (although
it supplies 1930 figures in many other tables). Nevertheless there is
evidence strongly supporting our conclusion that Negro income fell
relatively during the 1930&#8217;s &#8212; statistics on employment (not contained
in the report). We take the figures on manufacturing because this was
amongst the best-paid employment open to Negroes. In 1930. Negroes made
up 7.3% of all employees in manufacturing. By 1940, the figure had
fallen to 5.0% &#8212; a drop of almost one-third. According to the final
report of the Fair Employment Practices Committee in 1947, the 1940
figure was even lower than that of 1910, which was 6.2%! In other
words, 1939 was not a &#8220;normal&#8221; year for Negroes in relative employment
or in relative income, but represented the lowest point reached in both
fields in at least 10 and possibly 20 or 30 years.</p>
<p>Consequently, the 14% relative gain computed by using 1939 as the
base year does not show the overall ware trend but a temporary
fluctuation. What actually happened in 1939-50 was that the Negro
recovered some of the ground lost in the depression. (His proportion in
manufacturing rose from 5.1% in 1940 to 6.8% in 1950 &#8212; which was still
below the figure in 1930.) Was the Negro relatively better off in
income in 1950 than in 1930? The government will have to release the
1930 statistics before we can answer that question with certainty. If
he was relatively better off in 1950 than 1930, how much? Again the
answer will have to await the release of the statistics, but one thing
is sure &#8212; the figure will be much less than 14%.</p>

<p>Whatever else Table 1 does, it does not show the overall wage trend
of recent times. A comparison of 1930 (when the depression was just
beginning) with 1950 (when employment was high) would provide a far
more accurate picture of the over-all trend than this table (which is
based on comparison of a depression year with a year of relative
prosperity).</p>
<p>Having filled in the background that is needed to assess the
relative gains shown during the 1940&#8217;s, we must now seek an explanation
for those gains. A good place to begin is with data on shifts in the
population.<br>

<p class="fst">Another table, which we shall not reproduce here,
&#8220;reveals the shift of the Negro population, during this wartime decade
(1940-50), from Southern to Northern, Central and Western States. A
resulting decline in the number and proportion of Negroes in the
population occurred in the Southern States of West Virginia, Georgia,
Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Oklahoma. The Middle
Atlantic, East North Central, and Pacific States had the most
appreciable increases in their Negro population, and the percentage
increases for Negroes far exceed those of the white population.
Michigan&#8217;s Negro population more than doubled, while its white
population increased only 17%. In California the Negro population
increased 116%, compared with a 50% increase among whites.&#8221; Other data
dealing with population shifts in the big cities show heavy increases,
especially in non-Southern cities. These figures firmly establish the
shift in large numbers of Negroes from farm to city or town and out of
the South and the fact that proportionally this shift was greater among
Negroes than whites in the last decade.</p>

<p>Simultaneously came a shift in the proportion of people employed in
agriculture:</p>

<p class="fst">These figures show that on the whole the proportion of
the employed Negroes who were engaged in agriculture dropped much more
than that of whites similarly employed in the period under examination.</p>

<p>The greater urbanization and proletarianization of Negroes shown in
Tables 2 and 3 are a fact of tremendous economic, political and
sociological importance, but here we want to discuss only their effects
on relative incomes.</p>
<p>To begin with, wages are higher in the North and West than in the
South; a steel worker who moves from Alabama to Pennsylvania gets
higher wages for the same work. Similarly, wages are higher in urban
than rural areas; a tenant farmer or sharecropper who moves to the city
and becomes a factory worker also gets higher wages. Since more Negroes
migrated relatively than whites, the Negro&#8217;s relative income would have
risen as a result of his migration even if wage rates for all
occupations had remained absolutely stationary during the last decade.
Consequently one part (maybe even the major part) of the 14% relative
gain is due solely to the existence of wage differentials between urban
and rural areas and between North and South, and not to a narrowing of
Negro-white wage differentials within any of these areas.</p>
<p>The migrations enable us to judge the validity of the 14% figure as
a guide to relative changes not in wages but in real income during the
last decade:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not only wages but living costs are higher in urban and
non-Southern areas. Negroes migrated more than whites, so this factor
affected them more. In terms of real income or purchasing power,
therefore, the relative gain must have been less than 14%.</li>
<li>Many people employed on the land receive part of their income &#8220;in
kind&#8221; (board, lodging, produce). But this part of the income of the
1939 farmer who became a worker by 1950 is not included in the Table 1
figures, and so the increase in his real income is not actually as
great as those figures would indicate. Since Negro urbanization was
proportionally higher than white urbanization, this points to the need
for making another reduction in that 14% figure.</li>
<li>The last decade was marked by inflation, which strikes at the
living standards of both whites and Negroes but always hits the
lowest-income groups the hardest (who must spend more of their incomes
on food and other necessities which have risen most in price). Since
Negro wage income is shown to be only 52% of that of the whites at the
end of the decade, this means that the Negro&#8217;s real standard of living
(as distinct from money income) was adversely affected by inflation
more than that of the white, and that in terms of real income the 14%
figure must be reduced further. <a id="f6" href="#n6" name="f6" target="_blank" >[6]</a><br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h4>&#8220;Progress&#8221; in the Last Decade</h4>

<p class="fst">Next we turn attention to what happened to relative
income <em>within</em> the last decade because it throws clearer light
on the causes for the change in the decade as a whole and at the same
time further refutes claims about the &#8220;steadiness&#8221; of Negro progress.
Table 1 has already shown that the Negro&#8217;s relative wage suddenly fell
7% in the single year 1948-1949, with the beginning of the depression
that was staved off only by increased cold war arms spending. But there
are other statistics in the report that are even more illuminating:</p>

<p class="fst">Table 4 indicates that the high point in the relative
gains did not come at the end of the decade but in the middle, when the
figure reached 57%, &#8220;a comparative level that has not yet again been
reached in recent years,&#8221; as the report states. This loss of 3% among
Negro families as a whole from 1945 to 1950 was even exceeded among
urban Negro families which fell from 67% to 58% between 1945 and 1949
(1950 figures for this category are not supplied).<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Causes for the Changes</h4>
<p class="fst">Now we have the clues to the two main causes of the
changes of the last decade. One was the mechanization of agriculture,
which drove many people off the land, especially in the South, and gave
an added impetus to the migrations and urbanization. The other was the
war needs of the capitalist class, which erased the unemployment
prevalent at the beginning of the decade. The requirements of war, and
structural changes in the agricultural economy &#8212; these were the primary
factors responsible for whatever relative gain may have taken place,
and they operated independently of the will of the reformists and of
the needs of the masses, white or Negro.</p>
<p>When we call these the primary factors we don&#8217;t mean that they were
the only ones. The Negro people themselves intervened effectively at
many points. It was they who pulled up stakes and moved to new areas
(often against the advice of timid leaders who feared that migration to
the cities would provoke anti-Negro riots). It was they who won
concessions by independent action, by struggles inside the plants where
they broke clown some of the barriers to upgrading and hiring, and by
struggles outside the plants through organizations like the March on
Washington Movement whose threats to undertake militant mass action did
more to win a wartime FEPC order from Roosevelt than all the efforts of
the reformists combined. It was the labor movement, acting mainly in
self-defense to be sure, that saw to it that the newly-migrated Negro
workers were paid the prevailing wage scales, more or less, in the
plants under union contract.</p>
<p>We have no wish to minimize these other factors &#8212; on the contrary &#8212;
because these struggles confirm the basic outlook of the Marxists, not
the reformists; our aim here is rather to stress the conditions which
enabled these factors to operate with some success. In fact, we can
even afford to attribute a measure of participation in the process to
the reformists, who tried in their own way to persuade the ruling class
to lift some of the obstacles to Negro employment, which they decried
as harmful to the war effort, morally unjust, etc.; but, this doesn&#8217;t
mean the tail wagged the clog. (The reformists also had a negative
effect for wherever they had the influence they restrained the masses
from independent struggle in a crisis where such struggle could have
induced even greater concessions from the ruling class.)</p>
<p>We cannot determine statistically which of the two primary factors
was the more decisive, but we conclude that it was the war. Because as
soon as the war ended, the Negro&#8217;s relative gains ended too, and were
succeeded by relative losses. When the cold war began to be heated up,
further relative gains were recorded in certain spheres, but not enough
to make up for the losses of the second half of the decade as a whole.
At this point we must also ask the reformists: If the over-all gains of
the decade are to be credited to your policies, won&#8217;t you also have to
take the credit for the losses of the last five years, or explain why
your policies did not work during 1945-50? (This period, incidentally,
coincided with the Truman administration&#8217;s conduct of the noisiest
anti-Jim Crow reform demagogy in the history of the country.)</p>

<p>Turning now to a discussion of what the future holds, we begin with
the report&#8217;s data on unemployment:</p>

<p class="fst">This shows, the report says, that the average rate of
unemployment for Negroes has been &#8220;more than 50%&#8221; above that for whites
in recent years. (70% above in 1951.) &#8220;Although the rate was about 5%
for Negroes in 1951, compared with 3% for whites, about the same
relative improvement had taken place since 1949 when the economic
situation was less favorable.&#8221; (Again we must ask why the authors of
the report omitted the 1940 or 1939 figures, which are in their
possession. Because a comparison with the latest data would show a
considerable relative rise for Negroes in the average rate of
unemployment during the last decade?)</p>
<p>The same unfavorable proportions are shown in the data about
seniority. A survey in 1951 showed that &#8220;Negro workers had been on
their current jobs an average of 2.4 years, compared with an average of
3.5 years among white workers&#8221; &#8212; that is, seniority among white workers
is almost 50% higher than among Negroes. Moreover, &#8220;20% of urban white
men and only 13% of urban Negroes had worked on their current jobs
since before January 1940.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus if a depression takes place before a global war, Negro workers
as usual will be first and hardest hit, with calamitous results for all
the relative gains of the last decade.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s grant that the most likely variant for the next period is
not depression but continuation of the cold war leading to another
world war. Does that lend support to the vista, held out by the
reformists, of continued relative progress for the Negroes at
approximately the same rate as in the 1940&#8217;s, or anywhere near that
rate? Our answer must be a flat No because the special circumstances of
the last decade will not be operating in the next period, or not with
the same force. The same rate of relative gain will not continue
because the new base year (1950) is not a depression year such as 1939
was. It will not continue because the gap in urbanization has already
almost been closed (61% for Negroes to 64% for whites) and while
further migration will take plate it will be on a reduced scale and
therefore will not have the same impact on relative incomes as in the
40&#8217;s. And most of all it will not continue because World War III is
going to be a lot different from World War II.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Prospects If War Comes</h4>
<p class="fst">Last time the US had strong allies abroad and a neutral
if not friendly attitude from many other countries; next time its
allies will be neither strong nor dependable and Washington will enter
the war with the hate and suspicion of most of the world. Last time the
fighting was conducted far from US shores; next time the US will learn
how it feels to receive as well as give bombings. Last time the war,
beginning in a depression, produced a switch from mass unemployment to
full employment and an economic revival which permitted the capitalists
to grant some concessions to keep the population at home from getting
too restless; next time the war will begin when production will already
be at near-capacity levels and the working class will already be fully
employed and therefore will not produce the same psychological effects
on the people. On the contrary, the counter-revolutionary attempt to
subjugate the Soviet Union, China, Eastern Europe, the anti-capitalist
workers of Europe and the anti-imperialist masses of Asia. South
America, the Middle East and Africa will strain the economy to the
breaking point, impose crushing burdens on the American people and
generate discontent and resistance at home as well as abroad.</p>

<p>The inevitable tendency then will be not to grant but to withdraw
concessions from the masses. The ruling class will seek to freeze wages
solidly; to conscript labor and chain the workers to their jobs; to
regiment the unions and turn them into agencies of the state to
maintain labor discipline: to double and triple taxes until they
consume a majority of the workers&#8217; income; and to set up a
military-police dictatorship to put down all opposition to this
program. Those who preach and practice class collaboration, those whose
first allegiance is to capitalism rather than the working class, will
be utterly unable to halt or reverse this tendency even if they should
want to; only the methods of militant class struggle will be able to
stop the onslaughts of reaction.</p>
<p>And what will happen to the economic status of the Negro people? It
is of course conceivable that, even in such circumstances Negroes at
first might register slight relative gains in income where they were
drafted out of inessential jobs and into war production. But that would
be both the beginning and end of it. With strictly enforced
wage-freezing and staggering taxes, the real income and living
standards of the people would go down and not up. The relative status
of the Negro would be frozen for the duration of a war that everyone
expects to be as prolonged as it will be terrible, and all efforts to
change his status would be branded &#8220;subversive&#8221; and punished by the
heavy hand of the state.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>No Hope in Reformist Program</h4>
<p class="fst">Thus if a depression signifies the rapid loss of all
recent relative gains by the Negro, war means absolute losses for white
and Negro workers, with the Negro&#8217;s relative status fixed and frozen,
at best, for an indefinite period. Either way, the reformist
perspective holds out little hope to the Negro for genuine progress in
the present or the achievement of equality in the future.</p>
<p>In essence, the advocates of gradual reform exaggerate the relative
gains of the past and ascribe them to the wrong causes in order to
conciliate the Negro with his oppressor and to divert him from the
militant action which can both alleviate and end his oppression. This
program has always been a hoax; now it is becoming a trap too. If it
was harmful in the past, it is doubly harmful today because the United
States is approaching a fateful turning point. The future, as we have
tried to show, will not be a mere repetition of the past. In the
absence of a social upheaval led by the labor movement, the war will
bring a savage dictatorship which the ruling class will have no desire
to relax When or if the war ends.</p>
<p>In the pamphlet <strong>The Jim Crow Murder of Mr. and Mrs. Harry
T. Moore</strong>, we related the prospects of the Negroes in the US to
the fate of the Jews in Europe during the last war and demonstrated
that &#8220;conditions can arise which will wipe out in a single decade all
the gains that have been painfully accumulated in a century of
strenuous effort.&#8221; Such conditions will flourish luxuriantly in the
soil of the reaction that will accompany the next war. Instead of
continuing progress, the next period can see the Negro people used as
scapegoats for the capitalist class and menaced with the loss of all
their liberties and even with mass extermination. These dangers cannot
be wished out of existence by shutting eyes and covering ears and
reciting twisted statistics: they must be reckoned with and actively
combatted. For this task the reformists and their program are worse
than useless; they get in the way of the job that has to be done.</p>
<p>This article is mainly negative because its aim is to refute certain
misconceptions. But the perspective that Marxism offers the Negro
people is neither negative nor pessimistic. Capitalism, which looks so
powerful and imposing in this country today although it is the only
part of the world capitalist system that has any stability whatever, is
headed for its doom. It will not be any more successful than Hitler in
conquering the world, and like him will probably break its neck in the
process. The convulsions and crises arising out of the drive to war or
the war itself will radicalize the American people; they will also
provide the American people with opportunities to check the assaults on
their living standards and liberties, and take the political power and
the fate of the nation out of the hands of the capitalist minority.</p>

<p>For this a new party is needed; the sooner the job of building an
independent labor party is started, the sooner, smoother and less
costly the transfer of power will be. The American workers in alliance
with the Negro people, the poor farmers and the lower middle classes
are just the ones to do this job. When they do it, the economic roots
of racial oppression will be eradicated, the Negro people will secure
the equality that capitalism has stubbornly denied them in the 90 years
since the Emancipation Proclamation, and Jim Crow will become a memory
to puzzle future generations.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p class="note"><a id="n1" href="#f1" name="n1" target="_blank" >1.</a> The most
complete exposition of the Marxist position will be found in the
Socialist Workers Party resolution, <em>Negro Liberation through
Revolutionary Socialism</em>, <strong>Fourth International</strong>,
May-June, 1950.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n2" href="#f2" name="n2" target="_blank" >2.</a> Our use of the
data in the report does not mean we endorse or accept them. Statistics
are not correct merely because they are official. These were prepared
for the Senate subcommittee by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
publisher of the cost-of-living index which is notorious for its
anti-labor bias. Their main source is the Bureau of the Census, whose
studies admittedly are often incomplete and, because of
inadequately-trained census-takers, inexact. Furthermore, the Bureau of
the Census sometimes changes its definitions so that comparisons
between two censuses may be based on different things (for example, the
1950 census defines &#8220;family&#8221; in such a way as to exclude four million
persons included in 1940). Victor Perlo, in an article <em>Trends in
the Economic Status of the Negro People</em> (<strong>Science &amp;

Society</strong>, Spring, 1952) demonstrated that certain census
figures are misleading and different from those of other government
agencies. Consequently there is good reason to believe that the
statistics in the report give a rosier picture in many details than
reality warrants.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n3" href="#f3" name="n3" target="_blank" >3.</a> In a number of
places the report uses tables on &#8220;median&#8221; income but refers to them in
the text as &#8220;average&#8221; income. Similarly most of the data in its tables
concern &#8220;nonwhites&#8221; but the text uses the term &#8220;Negro.&#8221; (&#8220;Since Negroes
comprise more than 95% of the nonwhite group, the data for nonwhite
persons as a whole reflect predominantly the characteristics of
Negroes.&#8221;) In both cases this article follows the usage of the report
in tables and text.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n4" href="#f4" name="n4" target="_blank" >4.</a> Average life
expectancy at birth: In 1919-21 the figure for male Negroes was 84% of
that for male whites (47.1 years to 56.3 years); in 1949 it had become
89% (58.6 years for male Negroes to 65.9 years for male whites). Thus
male Negroes gained 2 years more than male whites and still lag behind
by over 7 years &#8212; a relative gain of 5%. For females, in 1919-21 the
figure for Negroes was 80% of that for whites (46.9 years to 58.5
years); in 1949 it had become 88% (62.9 years for Negroes to 71.5 years
for whites). Thus female Negroes gained 3 years more than female whites
and still lag behind 8&frac12; years &#8212; a relative gain of 8%.</p>
<p class="note">Median school years completed by persons 25 years old
and over: In 1940 the school attendance record of Negroes was 5.7
years, while that of whites was 8.7 years. In 1950 the figure was 7
years for Negroes, 9.7 years for whites. The change was from 66% to
72%, a relative gain of 6%.</p>
<p class="note">Occupational shifts: The report sums this up as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... the highest proportions of Negro workers
continue to be found in the lower-paying and less-skilled occupations,
such as service workers and laborers. Comparatively low proportions are
found in the professional, technical, managerial, clerical, sales, and
craftsmen occupations. However, the shift of Negroes into better-paying
occupations and more skilled occupations, accelerated during the war
years, has in general been maintained.&#8221;</p>
<p class="note">This latter statement is true only as a generalization;
while gains made during the war were maintained in some of the better
jobs, they were lost in others.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n5" href="#f5" name="n5" target="_blank" >5.</a> A different
definition of &#8220;urban&#8221; was used in 1950 than in 1940. With the old
definition, the total urban population would have been 8 million
smaller. For our purpose we will assume that the change in definition
does not affect the relative result.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n6" href="#f6" name="n6" target="_blank" >6.</a> Perlo (previous
citation), for example, offers Census figures to show that in this
decade average rents for Negro families rose 150% while those of whites
rose 61%, and that even in absolute terms of dollars Negro rentals rose
more than white on the average.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n7" href="#f7" name="n7" target="_blank" >7.</a> The difference
between this 1950 percentage for family income (54%) and the 1950
percentage for individual wage and salary income (52%) can be explained
as follows: In Negro families more members, especially married women,
are working than in white families.</p>
