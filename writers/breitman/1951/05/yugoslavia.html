<p class="info">From <strong>Fourth International</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/fi/index2.htm#fi51_05" target="new">Vol.12 No.3</a>, May-June 1951, pp.84-85.<br />

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%">
<p class="fst">For two and a half years the scribes of the Independent
Socialist League, formerly the Workers Party (Shachtmanites), wrote
scores of articles to demonstrate that &#8220;Titoism&#8221; is only another form
of Stalinism, and just as reactionary. Simultaneously, they
hysterically denounced the Socialist Workers Party and the Fourth
International for approaching the Yugoslav Communist Party
sympathetically and trying to influence its development in a
revolutionary Marxist direction.</p>
<p>Now, however, judging from an article by Henry Judd in the
March-April issue of the <strong>New International</strong>, the ISL
line seems in process of change. Judd was one of the noisiest critics
of our policy on Yugoslavia; only four months before the present
article his summation of the entire Yugoslav development since the
split with the Kremlin was that &#8220;the direction in Yugoslavia is away
from socialism and Workers&#8217; Statism.&#8221; Now &#8212; after throwing up the
smokescreen that &#8220;all&#8221; parties suffered from &#8220;short-sightedness,
superficiality and a failure to grasp the full significance of this
[Yugoslav] development,&#8221; with the Trotskyists &#8220;of course&#8221; being the
&#8220;outstanding example of this&#8221; &#8212; he declares:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Titoism must now be redefined as a legitimate and
serious international tendency, politically and ideologically, within
the revolutionary movement; it must be recognized as the first of many
other similar developments which, springing out of the world of
Stalinism, must be accepted as harbingers of new, hitherto unknown,
ideological currents with which socialists must sympathetically
collaborate.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">This is the position that we have taken, both in words
and actions, ever since the Tito-Stalin split three years ago. And this
is the position that Judd and the ISL kept denouncing not only as
shortsighted, ignorant, etc., but as a capitulation to Stalinism.</p>
<p>How account for this sudden turnabout? Judd tries to explain it away
(even while apologizing for the old ISL line in the past) in the
following manner:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The real fact of the matter is that both in terms of
internal political ideology and international politics, Titoism has
already passed beyond its early characteristics which permitted it to
be defined more or less correctly, if abstractly, as a Stalinist
movement, or a bureaucratic clique seeking to retain power by a
neutralist position in a divided world.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Judd does not explicitly indicate what &#8220;early
characteristics&#8221; he is referring to, and he remains very vague about
when it was that Titoism passed beyond them. But because this is the
central issue, we ourselves must stress that the policies of the
Yugoslav leaders have undergone important shifts since 1948, and show
both what these shifts were and when they took place.</p>

<ol>
<li>From the middle of 1948 to about the middle of 1949. This was the
period when the Yugoslav CP leaders tried to minimize their differences
with the Kremlin, withheld from the workers the full details and
history of the split, refused to engage in any criticism of Stalin and
Stalinism, and in general left the way open for a reconciliation.</li>
<li>From the middle of 1949 to the late summer or fall of 1950. Now
the Yugoslav leaders, faced with a tightening Cominform blockade and
openly designated as targets for assassination by the GPU, took a
decided turn to the left. They began to re-examine some of the
fundamental theories of Stalinism, the nature of the Soviet
bureaucracy, etc., and to move toward conclusions in accord with those
of Marxism. They disclosed the full history of their dispute with the
Kremlin, called on the workers of the world to return to Leninism, and
undertook a number of democratic reforms within their own country. At
the same time they proclaimed a foreign policy of independence from
both Washington and Moscow, although (his policy even then was not
without serious faults.</li>
<li>From the fall of 1950 to the present time. The outbreak of the
war in Korea brought an increased danger of a Kremlin-directed assault
on Yugoslavia together with increased pressure from Washington for
concessions from Belgrade in return for material aid to combat the
famine threatening the country. The Yugoslav leaders drew back,
especially in, their foreign policy, endorsed the UN policy on Korea,
promised to go to war on the side of the UN anywhere in Europe, and
began to make compromising advances to the international Social
Democracy.</li>
</ol>
<p class="fst">When was it, according to Judd, that Titoism changed
from &#8220;a Stalinist movement&#8221; into &#8220;a legitimate and serious
international tendency, politically and ideologically, within the
revolutionary movement?&#8221; Was it in 1949, when the Yugoslav leaders were
moving to the left? Or was it at the end of 1950, when they were
unmistakably moving to the right and collaboration with US imperialism?</p>
<p>Judd evades a direct answer. But it sticks out all over his article
&#8212; in the timing of his decision that a &#8220;redefinition&#8221; of Titoism is in
order, in the way he denounces us for criticizing the present
anti-internationalist foreign policy of the Yugoslav regime, and above
all in his insistence that &#8220;Titoism is clearly deepening the gap
between itself and Stalinism.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does Judd mean by this? A year ago Titoism was engaging in a
furious ideological struggle against Stalinism and dealing the Kremlin
damaging blows that reverberated all over Eastern and Western Europe &#8212;
and from the left. But nothing Tito did then could produce the
slightest expression of support from the ISL. What new thing has been
added that persuades Judd a genuine change for the better has taken
place within Titoism? Only one thing &#8212; Tito has abandoned his hesitant
moves to the left in the international field, submitted to the pressure
of Washington and apparently decided that his future is linked with the
camp of US imperialism.</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of Marxism, Tito is actually less anti-Stalinist
today than he was a year ago, for now he has completely reverted to the
kind of foreign policy he learned in the Kremlin school &#8212; collaboration
with imperialism, apologetics for the imperialist powers he hopes will
aid him as allies, dependence on the UN, and so on. In other words, the
very changes in Tito&#8217;s policy which endanger the revolutionary future
of Yugoslavia and merit the sharpest criticism of revolutionary
socialists are just the ones that have earned Judd&#8217;s admiration and
endorsement.</p>

<p>Thus the thinking that underlies Judd&#8217;s revision is far more
revealing than the revision itself &#8212; thinking that Judd shares with
most of his fellow ISL leaders, including some who are not yet ready to
subscribe to his new position on Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The fashion on Titoism, so far as American petty bourgeois radicals
and Stalinophobes are concerned, is set in Washington. Judd may not be
aware of this, but he reacts to it instinctively; that is why he is the
most reliable weathervane of the ISL leadership. Proceeding in the
belief that his policy of both yesterday and today contributes to the
struggle against Stalinism, which the ISL regards as its No.1 enemy, he
is actually twisted and turned by the pressure of the tail-end of
American imperialism.</p>
<p>The Shachtmanites don&#8217;t know where they are going, but almost
everyone else does. Long before Judd began his &#8220;redefinition,&#8221; it was
predicted by our movement. As Murry Weiss put it in his political
report on the Yugoslav question at the SWP Convention last November:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Social Democrats and centrists, who belatedly
recognized the importance of the Yugoslav affair, are attracted to the
worst features of the Yugoslav Communist Party and its policies. They
are &#8216;Titoist&#8217; whenever there is any indication of a swing to the right
[on the part of the Yugoslav leaders] ... As for the Shachtmanites &#8212;
they are not in our class camp but are simply a special case of left
Social Democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">A special case of left Social Democracy, but one which
is steadily losing its special traits. This is manifested not only by
their policy on Yugoslavia, but by their advocacy that labor
participate in capitalist party primaries, their unceasing internal
dispute over whether or not to support US imperialism in Korea and the
next world war, the increasing concessions which the openly
social-patriotic and pro-war wing of the organization wrings from its
opponents.</p>
<p>The Shachtmanites are an instructive example of the consequences of
Stalinophobia in the present tense world situation. They originally
split away from the Socialist Workers Party in 1940, saying they could
not remain in one party with advocates of the defense of the Soviet
Union against imperialism. Today they feel at home in one party with
advocates of support of imperialist war against the Soviet Union. What
price Third Camp?</p>
