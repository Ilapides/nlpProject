<p class="fst">Big Business spouts patriotic speeches about &#8220;the boys
in the foxholes&#8221; every time the workers ask for a wage increase to meet
the rising cost of living. But Big Business patriotism is only a
hypocritical cloak for self-interest. Profits always come first with
the capitalists &#8212; even during a war which they want to win. To get
profits and more profits they do not even hesitate to endanger the
lives of the men in the armed forces of this country and its allies.
Here is the proof:</p>
<p class="fst">On Jan. 17, 1943 &#8212; more than a year after Pearl Harbor &#8212;
the <em>S.S. Schenectady</em> snapped in half and sank off the West
Coast, only a few hours after it had been delivered to the Maritime
Commission. The American Bureau of Shipping reported the sinking was
due to the steel plate on the ship which was &#8220;brittle&#8221; and &#8220;more like
cast iron than steel.&#8221; The US Senate&#8217;s Truman Investigating Committee
took over the case and at a hearing before this body in Washington on
March 23, 1943, the truth came out: The defective steel had been
supplied by the Carnegie-Illinois Corporation, subsidiary of the giant
United States Steel Corporation, whose officials had willfully and
consciously delivered faulty material to the Navy, Maritime Commission
and Lend-Lease administration and had falsified the steel test records
to cover up their tracks.</p>
<p>Testimony before the Truman Committee showed that the faking of
tests had covered at least 28,000 tons of substandard plate; that minor
officials and employes who had complained to their superiors about the
faking of tests had had their &#8220;ears pinned back&#8221;; that high corporation
officials &#8220;instead of cooperating (with the Truman Committee) ...
attempted to delay and obstruct the investigation.&#8221; US Steel officials
naturally &#8220;deplored&#8221; the situation, describing it as &#8220;so unnecessary,&#8221;
and tried to put the blame on &#8220;a few individuals&#8221; with good intentions
who had grown &#8220;lax.&#8221; This alibi, however, was decisively rejected by a
federal grand jury in Pittsburgh in May, which refused to indict four
individual employees offered as scapegoats and indicted the
Carnegie-Illinois Corporation itself.</p>
<p>Equally indifferent to the murderous effects of its frauds was the
Anaconda Wire and Cable Company whose Marion, Ind., plant (financed by
the government) was indicted on Dec. 21, 1942 for conspiring to sell
the government defective communication and other combat wire, although
its officials &#8220;well knew at all times&#8221; that use of such wire would
&#8220;endanger the lives of men in the military service of the USA.&#8221; The
Pawtucket, R.I., plant of the company was indicted a month later on
similar charges.</p>
<p>The company was shown to have gone to great lengths to devise
ingenious machinery for escaping government tests of its defective wire
and thus getting the wire accepted for use by the armed forces of the
United States, Soviet Union and Britain. Senator Kilgore has pointed
out:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The batteries on all our warships, including the
anti-aircraft guns, are fired, controlled, aimed and ranges set, over
this self-same cable, and if the cable is defective, the ship is
helpless against aircraft attack. Also, the safety and success of the
entire land combat forces are frequently dependent on messages sent
overland by these self-same cables.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The government charged that the conspiracy began about
Nov. 1, 1940 and continued up to Oct. 1, 1942. Commenting on this,
Senator Bone said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The fact that we were suddenly plunged into a deadly
war did not in any wise induce the defendants to change the criminal
practices outlined in the complaint. After Pearl Harbor, and while the
boys were dying on the battlefields. Anaconda and its officials
continued their sordid work of defrauding the government by furnishing
faulty cable.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Bone also declared the cable was &#8220;so defective that the
persons deliberately creating the defects would be brought before a
firing squad if they had done this in the war zones.&#8221; Attorney General
Biddle called it &#8220;one of the most reprehensible cases of defrauding the
government and endangering the lives of American soldiers and sailors
ever to come to the attention of the Department of Justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was no more reprehensible than the case of the Wright
Aeronautical Corporation, subsidiary of the huge Curtiss-Wright
Corporation, holder of the second largest war contracts in the country.
Wright&#8217;s Lockland, O., plant (financed by the government) was accused
by the Truman Committee in July 1943 of falsifying tests on airplane
engines, destroying records, forging inspection reports, changing
tolerances allowed on parts, skipping inspection operations, etc.
Inspectors who complained were intimidated or transferred. These
activities were aided, abetted and covered up by Army inspectors and
important Army officials influenced by the corporation. The result,
according to the committee&#8217;s report, was:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Engines were built and sold to the government which
were leaking gasoline ... Unsafe material has been discovered In
completed engines ready for delivery. The company&#8217;s own reports from
its field representatives indicate that these parts had failed in a
substantial number of cases. A substantial number of airplanes using
this engine have had crashes in which engine failures were involved ...
More than 25% of the engines built at the plant have consistently
failed in one or more major parts during a three-hour test run. Spare
parts were shipped without praper inspection ...&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Accused of exaggerating the gravity of conditions at the
Lockland plant, Truman retorted:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The facts are that they were turning out phony
engines and I have no doubt a lot of kids in training planes have been
killed as a result. The Committee was conservative in its report, in
order to prevent too much alarm over the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">A number of other and smaller companies were accused of
the same crime during 1943: the Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation of
Detroit, charged with fraud for willfully violating specifications for
engine castings used in Rolls Royce airplanes; the Sandusky Foundry and
Machinery Company of Sandusky, O., whose officials pleaded guilty to
faking tests on propellor sleeves used on Navy vessels; the National
Bronze and Aluminum Company of Cleveland, convicted for selling the
government defective sand and aluminum mold castings which are used in
combat planes; the Antonelli Fireworks Company of Spencerport, N.Y.,
indicted for deliberately selling the Army faulty hand grenades and
incendiary bombs; the Collyer Insulated Wire Company of Rhode Island,
indicted for conspiring to avoid government inspection and deliver
defective wire and cable.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Biddle&#8217;s Admissions</h4>

<p class="fst">Nor does this exhaust the list. In a speech in Chicago
on Aug. 23, 1943, Attorney General Biddle reported that Big Business
frauds in this war are &#8220;much bigger than they were in 1917 or 1918&#8221;; he
declared that 123 federal indictments had already been filed, with
1,279 investigations pending. Biddle did not indicate how many of these
indictments and investigations involve fraud endangering the lives of
servicemen, but there can be no doubt that a substantial number do.</p>
<p>In this same speech Biddle noted that so far 71 cases have been
disposed of, with convictions or other penalties in about 90% of the
cases. But, he complained, in many cases the offenders had gotten off
with extremely light penalties. If anything, that was an
understatement. While a few of the smaller companies have not gotten
off scot free and some of their officials have even been given prison
sentences, the great majority of offenders &#8212; and particularly the
powerful ones &#8212; have escaped thus far with at most a mere slap on the
wrist. Typical was the trial in Fort Wayne, Ind., June, 1943, of the
Anaconda Wire and Cable Marion plant:</p>
<p class="fst">&#8220;The most obnoxious fraud ever presented to a court of
the United States!&#8221; That was how a prosecuting attorney described the
Anaconda case. &#8220;Revolting&#8221; was the comment by Federal Judge Thomas W.
Slick, who presided at the trial. Nevertheless, not a single one of the
indicted Anaconda officials spent an hour in jail for their crimes.
Some were fined and given prison sentences, but the judge ordered the
suspension of the prison sentences upon payment of ridiculously light
fines. Anaconda attorneys at the trial volunteered the information that
the company had made $46,000 from the frauds, but the total fines
imposed by Judge Slick came to $31,000. Thus, even after paying these
fines the company had a tidy margin of profit from its criminal
activities!</p>
<p>The company got away so easily by pleading <em>nolo contendere</em>,
that is, not contesting the charges and throwing itself on the mercy of
the court. Its lawyers admitted &#8220;technical guilt&#8221; but not &#8220;moral
guilt&#8221;; they explained their reluctance to go before a trial jury on
the ground that such a course &#8220;would have impeded the war effort.&#8221; The
court, as has been shown, was exceedingly merciful. The judge explained
the suspension of prison terms by saying he felt the guilty officials
&#8220;could better serve the war effort by going back to work&#8221;; he did not
say whether he meant the same kind of work for which they had been
indicted. The judge also asserted that this disposition of the case
would &#8220;stop anything of a similar nature elsewhere&#8221; &#8212; a view shared by
almost no one else. Thus, the first important trial for wartime fraud
endangering the armed forces indicated that Big Business can get away
with murder.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; some people say, &#8220;these are the crimes of individual
corporations, and Big Business as a whole should not be blamed for
them.&#8221; This is the position taken among others by AFL president William
Green and CIO secretary James Carey. Contemptible as this argument is &#8212;
especially from trade union leaders who are supposed to defend the
interests of the workers against their Big Business enemies &#8212; it
deserves an answer.</p>
<p>First, it must be remembered that US Steel and Curtiss-Wright are
not two-bit businesses unrelated to the rest of industry. On the
contrary, they are among the most powerful groups in American Big
Business, being two of the 25 companies which hold 50% of the war
contracts, and they are controlled by the same financial interests that
dominate the national economy. Check the names of their chief
stockholders and boards of directors and you will find listed the same
respected bankers and industrialists who top the list of America&#8217;s
Sixty Families.</p>
<p>Second, let it be noted that the revelations of these wartime crimes
have not evoked a single word of criticism or denunciation from a
single important capitalist in this country. The employers&#8217;
associations, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of
Commerce &#8212; all have been as silent as the tomb, none has even implied
that there is anything reprehensible in frauds that deliberately
endanger servicemen&#8217;s lives. This silence speaks volumes more than a
million consciously deceptive statements by cowards like Green and
Carey, for it indicates that the basic outlook of the corporations
caught in the act is shared by Big Business as a whole.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Cynical Whitewash</h4>
<p class="fst">Third, there is the behavior of the capitalist press,
which reaps fortunes from the big patriotic advertisements inserted in
their pages by the powerful corporations (and paid for out of the
taxpayers&#8217; money). For every line they have devoted to incomplete and
confusing accounts of the war frauds, they have printed ten lines
whitewashing the corporations and trying to smear the Truman Committee.
When used at all, the stories of the wartime frauds have been relegated
for the most part to the inside pages where they will not attract the
same attention as the huge headlines and editorials denouncing the
miners and other workers forced to strike in order to secure a living
wage. This is not because the capitalist press fails to recognize news
when it sees it; rather it is because the press recognizes that these
crimes are a damning indictment of all capitalists.</p>
<p>Fourth, and most revealing, there is the following evidence about
the steel and aircraft industries as a whole: A few days after the
Truman Committee hearing on US Steel had been concluded, the steel
barons began to talk about a threatening decline of 35% in national
steel production. &#8220;Lower production prospects are due to the
demoralizing fear the Senate inquiry has instilled into <em>every</em>
steel plant,&#8221; said the <strong>Pittsburgh Post Gazette</strong>, on
Apr. 16, 1943. These reports &#8212; inspired by the steel corporations in an
attempt to get the Truman Committee to lay off &#8212; showed that the entire
steel industry feared such investigations. The only logical explanation
for this fear is that other steel corporations besides US Steel are
engaged in illegal production practices.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the capitalist press was trying to blame the Truman
Committee for an 85% decline in shipment of finished airplane engines
at Wright&#8217;s Lockland plant in the period between April and August,
1943, it was shown that Curtiss-Wright was not the only company
panic-stricken by the prospect of investigation:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Leading industrialists and production experts the
country over are carefully watching the case,...&#8221; the <strong>New York
Times</strong>, reported on Sept. 2. &#8220;The extent to which other
companies and other plants of the Curtiss-Wright group have been
affected by what happened at Lockland is difficult to estimate. Many
other concerns are said to be worrying, however, lest they run into
similar situations ...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">But why should they be worrying if they are not guilty
of the same crimes as Curtiss-Wright? Their apprehension is good reason
for concluding that the Truman Committee investigations have scratched
only the surface of Big Business crimes in this war and that further
investigation would involve all the other big monopolies and
corporations.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>True to Form</h4>
<p class="fst">The sale of defective war material has shocked some
people more than the other wartime activities of the corporations
because it is so openly cynical and in such flagrant contrast to the
high-minded sentiments spread over the newspaper advertisements. As a
result there is a tendency to look upon this practice as something
exceptional and unrelated to the general policies of capitalism. But at
bottom it is no different in kind from the other &#8220;scandals&#8221; perpetrated
by Big Business every day in the year.</p>
<p>The explanation for the policies and activities of the monopolies
and corporations is always to be found in the profit motive. No
employer keeps his factory running unless there is profit to be made
from it. This is as true in wartime as in peacetime, with only one
difference: in wartime there is usually more profit to be made and the
capitalists, maddened by greed, sweep aside all restraints and
obstacles in the way of ever greater profits. Rare indeed is the case
of an employer who has said: &#8220;I have got enough.&#8221; The tendency of the
ruling class is always to go after more and more. Billions are being
made on war contracts, but even the most powerful corporations do not
disdain to pick up a few millions extra by manufacturing substandard
products and then palming off the defective material as the article for
which they are being paid such generous prices.</p>
<p>But in what sense does this differ from the normal practices of
capitalism? In peacetime Big Business&#8217; concern for profits and profits
alone often results in the shutting of the factories. The hardships
this brings to the whole working class, the undernourishment it visits
on millions of children, the diseases that follow in its wake, surely
take as heavy a toll of human life and well-being as the war frauds.
Who will say which is worse? Who will contend that the cause is
different?</p>
<p>What about war profiteering? The people were solemnly assured that
there would be no war millionaires this time. Yet profits were bigger
in 1942, after the payment of taxes, than they were during the last war
or in the boom year of 1929. And they were 14% higher during the first
six months of 1943 than during the same period in 1942, according to a
report by the Department of Commerce. Which scandal is more detestable
&#8212; the war frauds or the war profiteering which will place heavy burdens
on all the masses and act as a drag on their living standards for years
to come? And who will deny the connection between the two?</p>
<p>No, the Big Business &#8220;scandals&#8221; of this war do not begin and end
with their cynical disregard for the safety of the servicemen. They
began long ago, they touch on every aspect of the war program and they
vitally affect the rights and conditions of every worker.</p>
<p>Ask the sailors at Pearl Harbor and they will tell you what they
think about the manufacturers who sold the Japanese warlords the scrap
metal used to make the bombs that were dropped upon them.</p>

<p>Ask the marines in the malaria-infested South Pacific jungles what
they think about the capitalists who restricted the production of
quinine and other drugs so that they could maintain high prices for
these products.</p>
<p>Ask the aviators and the merchant marine men, who survived the
sinking of their ships what they think About rubber barons and oil
magnates whose demand for monopoly control of rubber in the post-war
period impeded the production of synthetic rubber necessary to build
rafts and other life-saving equipment.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Critical Shortages</h4>
<p class="fst">There are shortages of aluminum, binoculars, critical
chemicals, magnesium, tetracene, dyestuffs, tungsten carbide, etc., all
important materials in wartime. The reason? Because Standard Oil, du
Pont, General Electric, ALCOA, General Motors and the other big
corporations formed cartels with their fellow monopolists in Germany,
Britain, France, Japan, etc., for the purpose of restricting
production, maintaining monopoly and raising prices. More lives have
been lost in this war because of these cartel deals than because of the
sale of defective material.</p>
<p>Other shortages affecting the war program can be traced directly to
the fact that the big corporations have hogged the great majority of
the government&#8217;s war contracts. As Assistant Attorney General Tom C.
Clark has reported:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;At the start of the war program in this country
175,000 companies provided 70% of the nation&#8217;s manufacturing output,
while today, two and a half years later, the ratio has been reversed to
the point where 100 corporations hold 70% of the war and essential
civilian contracts. This group, he declared, has obtained the bulk of
the fourteen billion dollars worth o! new plants built at government
expense.&#8221; (<strong>New York Times</strong>, April 23, 1943.)</p>
<p class="fst">As a result many small plants have been driven to the
wall; with them disappeared their productive capacity, while many of
the new plants remain partly unused and unproductive. A typical example
of how the monopolists impede production is the shipbuilding industry,
where the revolutionary Higgins assembly-line production program was
strangled because it was considered a competitive threat to the
position of powerful companies like Bethlehem Steel.</p>

<p>Other wartime blessings for which the workers can think Big Business
are: the speedup, which resulted in 1942 in a greater number of
casualties on the industrial front than on the military front; an
artificially created manpower shortage &#8212; due to labor hoarding by the
manufacturers and big agricultural interests, discrimination against
Negro and women workers, managerial inefficiency &#8212; which is used to
justify freezing the workers to low-paid jobs; an aggravation of the
housing crisis in many war production centers, resulting in increased
sickness, disease, child delinquency and disruption of family life;
food shortages designed to force price rises. <a id="f1" href="#n1"
name="f1" target="_blank" >[1]</a></p>
<p>Big Business could not get away with all this if there were a
government in Washington seriously interested in stopping it. But the
government is itself the outstanding advocate of capitalism. The
government is well aware of the attitude of Big Business, as was shown
in Monograph No.26, <strong>Economic Power and Political Pressure</strong>,
issued by the government&#8217;s Temporary National Economic Committee in
November, 1940, and stating in part:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Speaking bluntly, the government and the public are
&#8216;over a barrel&#8217; when it comes to dealing with business in time of war
or other crisis. Business refuses to work, except on terms which it
dictates. It controls the natural resources, the liquid assets, the
strategic position in the country&#8217;s economic structure, and its
technical equipment and knowledge of processes. The experience of the
World War, now apparently being repeated, indicates that business will
use this control only if it is &#8216;paid properly.&#8217; In effect, this is
blackmail, not too fully disguised.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Blackmail it may be, but the government has given in to
it without complaint or rancor. It has given the employers the greatest
profits in their history; and to pay for these profits, it has piled
one scandalous tax bill after another on the masses, frozen wages and
jobs, prohibited strikes, prevented effective price control, abolished
all limits on big salaries. Big Business has no reason to complain that
it is not being &#8220;paid properly,&#8221; according to its own lights. To make
doubly sure that they don&#8217;t muff any opportunities, the corporations
have offered and the government has appointed a considerable number of
dollar-a-year men to head the most important wartime agencies and
posts. Even the New Deal Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes
admitted on July 21, 1943, that &#8220;it is the business men who are running
the war.&#8221; And while running it, they see to it that the interests of
the corporations are well protected.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Government Cooperation</h4>
<p class="fst">Even after Pearl Harbor the government was still trying
to get industry to discontinue illegal practices hampering war
production. Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold complained in his
report to Congress on Jan. 3, 1942, about:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... the attitude of powerful private groups
dominating basic industries who have feared to expand their production
because expansion would endanger their future control of industry ...
There is not an organized basic industry in the United States which has
not been restricting production by some device or other in order to
avoid what they call the &#8216;ruinous overproduction after the war&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The government pleaded with the corporations to
cooperate, to discontinue their cartel deals and violations of the
anti-trust laws, and to let other companies use their patents for war
production; the corporations flatly refused. Early in 1942 the
government &#8212; in order to prevent the complete breakdown of the war
program, that is, in order to protect the interests of the capitalist
class as a whole &#8212; was finally compelled to institute a series of suits
against a number of monopolies, making public the damning facts about
which the government had been aware for many years.</p>
<p>The corporations had been caught red-handed. But the government,
once having gotten their promise to permit the use of the patents
during the war, dropped the charges and let these corporations escape
virtually unpunished. Standard Oil, for example, whose restriction of
synthetic rubber production had blocked the whole war production
program, was permitted to plead <em>nolo contendere</em> and was given
a $50,000 fine (which amounts to about the average profit this
corporation makes every hour). The other corporations got away even
more easily. To make the government&#8217;s attitude unmistakably clear,
Arnold, Biddle, Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of Navy Knox
wrote Roosevelt on March 20, 1942, in the midst of the public
revelations about the cartels, and said that</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... some of the pending court investigations, suits
and prosecutions under the anti-trust statutes by the Department of
Justice, if continued, will interfere with the production of war
materials. ... In those cases we believe that continuing such
prosecutions at this time will be contrary to the national interest and
security.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">This was some more &#8220;blackmail,&#8221; a threat to hold up on
production if the prosecutions were continued, with government
officials covering up for the corporations. Rosevelt answered: &#8220;I
approve the procedure outlined in your memorandum to me ...&#8221; Thus,
punishment of the corporations for violating the laws has been
postponed to some remote future in the post-war period, if then.</p>
<p>The same course has been followed in connection with the defective
war material cases. Reluctantly the government has been compelled to
prosecute in a few of the more flagrant cases, but each time high
government representatives have stepped forward to make light of the
corporation crimes.</p>
<p>The War Production Board held a closed meeting on the US Steel case,
but its only outcome was a statement by WPB chairman Donald Nelson
deploring a &#8220;more than usual&#8221; vigilance on the part of steel plant
inspectors and a WPB telegram to several steel companies urging them
not to lean over backwards while seeking &#8220;unattainable perfection&#8221; in
meeting production specifications. Other key government spokesmen
issued statements implying that there was no need to worry about the
practices of US Steel.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Labor Must Act</h4>
<p class="fst">When a wave of protest arose after the Truman
Investigation of Curtiss-Wright, Undersecretary of War Patterson, while
not daring to deny the truth of Truman&#8217;s charges, nevertheless issued a
statement asserting that conditions at the Lockland plant were &#8220;much
less sensational than some of the inferences drawn in recently
published statements.&#8221; An Army investigation board under Lt. General
William S. Knudsen also had to admit the Truman Committee charges were
accurate but sought to minimize their importance. Both these and other
government officials seemed more concerned in. quieting public
indignation than in taking measures against the Curtiss-Wright
criminals.</p>
<p>And during the period between Anaconda Wire and Cable&#8217;s indictment
and trial, the Offices of the Inspector of Navy Material in New York
and Cincinnati went out of their way to commend Anaconda for its &#8220;good
workmanship&#8221; and to announce that it was being considered for an &#8220;E&#8221;
award. During this same period Army and Navy procurement officials
showed how little concerned they were about the corporation&#8217;s
malpractices by awarding Anaconda&#8217;s Marion plant almost $4,000,000 in
additional business.</p>
<p>The trade union and liberal press have protested against most of the
Big Business crimes and have often criticized government officials for
their behavior. But they continue to regard each of the crimes and
whitewash moves as a unique incident, isolated from all the others and
caused by bungling or some other bad quality of individual capitalists
and government officials. That is one reason why the union leaders and
liberals are unable to work out a program to effectively combat such
crimes.</p>
<p>The workers who are seriously concerned about the present situation
must take another approach. They must learn to look at all the crimes
of capitalism together as a whole and to understand that each
individual &#8220;scandal&#8221; is part of and flows from the biggest scandal of
all &#8212; Big Business domination not only of the war program but of the
whole national economy. They must recognize that Big Business could not
get away with its crimes were it not for the collusion or at best
indifference of the government officials. Only on this basis can they
determine on effective countermeasures. For Big Business will not
voluntarily change its methods, and the administration and Congress
will not and cannot make the punishment fit the crime. If anything is
to be done, it will have to be done by the labor movement.</p>
<p>Whatever else one may conclude from these government actions, it is
safe to say that they do not have the effect of strongly discouraging
war frauds.</p>
<p>Some people have suggested the passage of legislation imposing the
death penalty on manufacturers whose fraudulent practices endanger the
lives of the men in the armed forces. A bill providing this penalty or
a million dollar fine has even been introduced into Congress. It is
hard to imagine the present Congress &#8212; which is the servant, body and
soul, of the big corporations &#8212; ever adopting legislation to punish
them. The members of the administration who have been rushing into
print to defend the corporations accused of fraud likewise have no
interest in seeing such a bill passed.</p>
<p>Because its adoption would undoubtedly have the effect of
discouraging many corporations from continuing their murderous frauds,
a Socialist Workers Party member of Congress would vote for this bill.
But as he did so, he would warn the workers that its passage alone
could not put an end to the crimes of Big Business for it would not do
away with the basic causes of such crimes: the profit motive and the
corporations&#8217; domination over the means of production.</p>
<p>To get to the root of the problem, the Socialist Workers Party
advocates that the ownership and control of industry be taken out of
the hands of the capitalists. This course of action will be regarded by
Big Business as far more drastic than any bill providing the death
penalty and it will be fought by them with every weapon they have, but
it is the only practical answer to capitalist mismanagement of industry.</p>

<p>At its June 1943 meeting in Toronto, the international executive
board of the United Auto Workers, CIO, drew up a series of proposals
designed to ensure full employment in the post-war period. One of these
called for government ownership after the war of &#8220;monopolistic
industries and of industries strategically essential to the national
safety.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Why Postpone?</h4>
<p class="fst">This is a sound idea, and offers the key to the solution
not only of unemployment, as nationalized production has shown in the
Soviet Union, but also of the criminal practices of the capitalist
class. Let industry be owned by the government and operated under the
control of committees democratically elected by the workers. The profit
motive would be removed, and with it would be removed the incentive to
produce and sell dangerously defective products. The costs of
production would be lowered and the workers&#8217; committees, having no
interest in exacting profits from the blood of the soldiers, would
guarantee production and honest testing in the interests of the masses
of the people.</p>
<p>The UAW executive board proposes post-war government ownership of
industry. But why wait until the war is over? The contents of this
pamphlet demonstrate that Big Business domination of industry menaces
the welfare and safety of the masses in wartime as much as if not more
than in peacetime. The war may last a long time, and so long as Big
Business is in control, the number of victims of capitalist greed will
continue to mount. Meanwhile the big corporations are using the war
itself to smash thousands of smaller businesses and to tighten their
own grip on industry. The longer the workers wait, the harder it may
prove to expropriate the capitalists. The time to act is now.</p>
<p>It will not be easy to put this program into effect. Union men and
women who have had to strike for a wage increase of even five cents an
hour know how vindictively the employers resist every challenge to
their profits; capitalist ferocity will be multiplied a hundred times
when the workers try to take the factories away from them. The daily
press and radio commentators will become frenzied in their
denunciations and incitations to violence against the workers; all the
instruments of capitalist propaganda will be turned on full blast to
bolster the myth that production cannot continue without the capitalist
coupon-clippers, that society cannot function without parasitic
exploiters. And, of course, the capitalists will be aided throughout in
this campaign by their political parties and their agents in the
government.</p>
<p>The question of who is to own and operate industry is a political
problem. To make the change that is necessary the workers will have to
conduct a political struggle against Big Business. The employers
already have their political organizations, the Republican and
Democratic Parties, and to fight them successfully the workers will
have to create a political organization of their own. The capitalist
parties are last-ditch supporters of the system of private property and
private profit which enables the employers to do what they wish with
the means of production. The workers need a party which will be just as
firmly devoted to the program of government ownership and workers&#8217;
control of industry. That means an independent labor party, based on
the trade unions and running its own labor candidates in elections.</p>
<p>The present government has already shown where it stands on this
question. The billions of dollars worth of factories, properties and
equipment now owned by the government are going to be turned over at
bargain prices after the war to the employers, who will use them to
swell their profits and to further strengthen their monopoly control.
That is why the workers and their party must fight for the creation of
a new kind of government, one which will aid, not oppose the struggle
for government ownership and workers&#8217; control, a Workers&#8217; and Farmers&#8217;
Government.</p>
<p>The wartime production crimes have torn away the mask from the
rapaciously greedy countenance of Big Business. Now the working people
must tear out of the capitalists&#8217; hands the power to continue their
criminal activities.</p>
