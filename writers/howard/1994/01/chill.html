<p class="fst"><strong>[Politics of Continuity:] British Foreign Policy and the Labour Government 1945&#8211;46</strong> <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a><br/>
John Saville<br/>
<em>Verso &#163;34.95</em></p>

<p class="fst">How did Britain in 1945 under a Labour government get involved in
a Cold War for nearly 40 years? John Saville shows how little it had
to do with the &#8216;Soviet Menace&#8217; and how much it was the
responsibility of the ruling class.</p>

<p>When Labour&#8217;s Prime Minister Attlee put Ernest Bevin in charge
of foreign policy, he omitted to throw out the public school trained
first division civil servants who administered Britain&#8217;s foreign
and colonial policies. Sir Alexander Cadogan, head of the Foreign
Office under the Tory Anthony Eden, was kept on the team in the same
job under Bevin, and wrote of another Labour minister, the left
winger Aneurin Bevan, &#8216;He and his kidney are mere barnacles on the
bottom of the &#8220;ship of state&#8221;. In any decent country they&#8217;d be
bumped off. To that extent am I &#8220;Fascist&#8221; and proud of it!&#8217;
Cadogan and others like him maintained great influence over the
direction of the Labour government&#8217;s foreign policy.</p>

<p>Bevin&#8217;s stupidity comes across clearly in Saville&#8217;s book. Only
seven weeks after the war Bevin told the Russians that their policies
resembled Hitler&#8217;s. Millionaire imperialists had worked on Bevin
before the war, taking him on world cruises and convincing him of the
need for Britain to continue to extract cheap raw materials and oil
from its colonies. After the war, Bevin agreed with his Tory advisers
that the Arab Countries threatened to cut the empire in half, and
Britain should continue to keep bases in Egypt, Iran and Iraq. Bevin
and his advisers thus set in motion the policies whose failure
resulted in the expulsion of the Palestinians from their homeland,
helping to create Israel as the only state that would protect
Britain&#8217;s claim to cheap oil and a safe route to the empire east of Suez.</p>

<p>From Saville&#8217;s history, it is clear that Britain&#8217;s ruling
class was able, under Bevin and Attlee, to extend its claim to a
position as a world power. British imperialism continued even more
successfully than before the war to bleed the wealth of the Third
World into the banks of the City of London.</p>

<p>Saville graphically describes one outcome of Labour&#8217;s
anti-Communist strategy. British intervention on behalf of French
imperialism sparked off the bloody 28 year long struggle of the
Vietnamese for their independence. In the final days of the Japanese
occupation, the Vietnamese leaders under Ho Chi Minh thought that in
Japan they had gained an Asian ally against the return of French
control of the region. However after the defeat of Japan, a united
force was set up under British control of French, Japanese and Indian
forces to suppress the people&#8217;s struggle for independence in Laos,
Kampuchea and Vietnam. Japanese troops, at that time being reviled in
Britain for war crimes, fought a short and bloody war, alongside the
British and the French, to put a corrupt and racist group of
colonialists back into power.</p>

<p>As a series of essays in the exposure of British hypocrisy about
the aims of the Second World War and on the origins of the Cold War,
Saville&#8217;s book is excellent. However, he doesn&#8217;t make clear that
it was the policy of the Communist Party that led to the failure of
the working class to support Vietnamese liberation in 1945. The right
of self-determination, clearly advocated by Lenin during the First
World War, was abandoned by the parties loyal to Stalin after the
Second World War.</p>

<p>Thus the French Communist Party supported the resumption of French
power in Vietnam after the defeat of the Japanese invaders. The
movement for Vietnamese independence was led in Saigon by Trotskyists
and was under way before the British landed in September 1945, to
take over power from the Japanese. The Vietminh, led by the
Communists, crushed the Saigon workers&#8217; uprising, arrested and
killed the Trotskyists and imposed order with the help of the
Japanese occupation forces until the British arrived.</p>

<p>Saville argues correctly that Britain&#8217;s policy under Labour was
strongly determined by its economic dependence upon the United
States. Labour sought to rebuild trade with the empire on terms that
would favour the sale of its raw materials to the US in order to pay
off the debt Britain incurred during the war. The US made this policy
unavoidable for British capitalism when it withdrew Lease-Lend aid to
Britain on the very day that Japan surrendered. In 1944, Churchill&#8217;s
war time coalition accepted the US demand that all British overseas
trade should be conducted in pounds freely convertible to dollars.
Thus the US was well on the way to opening up the British empire to
US capital, even before the war was concluded. In return, British
capitalists were able to convince the Americans that any insurrection
in the British colonies would open up the way to Communist expansion.</p>

<p>The origins of the Cold War lay in the great global crisis that
came at the end of the Second World War. In the US in 1946, war
production dropped suddenly from 41 percent of the nation&#8217;s output
to 9 percent. The effect on living standards was dramatic. Workers&#8217;
wages fell by 10 percent as employers tried to save their profits by
inflating prices by 16 percent. A huge wave of strikes broke out,
which the employers attacked as a Communist plot. But far from being
in a position to take power, the Communist Party in the US faced an
overwhelming onslaught headed by mass sackings and witch-hunts.</p>

<p>The Stalinist rulers in Eastern Europe meanwhile were faced with
the outbreak of massive opposition. Stalin forcibly moved hundreds of
thousands to Central Asia, and sent equal numbers of ethnic Russians
into the areas demanding self-determination. In all the East European
countries later to be incorporated into the Warsaw Pact by the force
of Russian tanks, measures were taken under pressure from Moscow to
incorporate the workers&#8217; parties into coalitions with the remnants
of the bourgeois parties, many of whose members had collaborated with
the Nazis during the war. Stalin&#8217;s occupation forces denied workers
the right to independent unions or to the use of the strike weapon in
their own interests.</p>

<p>Saville, despite the breadth of his analysis, ignores the totality
of this global attack on workers and peasants, east and west, during
which the Labour government acted to advance the oncoming Cold War.
Even in countries like Italy and Greece, Stalin helped the British
and American armies to crush workers&#8217; power, or by directing the
powerful Communist led movements into accepting ministerial offices
in coalition governments.</p>

<p>American capitalism&#8217;s greed for an open door to world markets
forced its Russian competitors to set up an iron curtain to keep
American goods out and the refugees in. But the view of the Americans
as the most powerful initiators of the Cold War was used, not to
build working class resistance east and west to US expansion, but to
justify the building of the Berlin Wall with all the exploitation and
oppression that went on behind it. The Cold War was the product of
the vicious competition inherent within capitalism and state
capitalism worldwide.</p>

<p>Though he unrealistically suggests that patient negotiation with
Moscow might have created a different outcome to the Cold War, and
does not extend his analysis to the causes of the crises that forced
all the contending powers into 40 years of wasteful military
competition, John Saville has given us valuable insights into the
realities of history that created the disastrous state of today&#8217;s world.</p>
