<p class="fst">Nick Howard, an inspiring revolutionary socialist for six decades, has died a few days after his 83rd birthday.</p>

<p>In an extraordinary life, Nick was an eyewitness to revolution around the world in the 1950s. Serving in the Merchant Navy for ten years became a tour of political hotspots.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always happened to be somewhere where things were going off,&#8221;; Nick said in an archive interview.</p>

<p>He was working as a ship&#8217;s officer and navigator sailing in the Suez Canal the day Egyptian leader Gamal Abdul Nasser nationalised it. &#8220;Gentlemen, you&#8217;re now working for Col. Nasser,&#8221; Nick recalled an Egyptian officer telling the crew. Nick refused to serve on a British government supply ship after war broke out.</p>

<p>Another ship he served on was &#8220;arrested&#8221; during a US-backed right-wing island rebellion against President Sukarno in Indonesia. Such events politicised Nick. He left the sea after taking part in a strike over conditions.</p>

<p>He worked in a maritime library then won a scholarship to the London School of Economics where he joined the International Socialism Group, later known as the International Socialists (IS), forerunner to the Socialist Workers Party, around 1961&#8211;62.</p>

<p>After he graduated from the LSE in 1964 he got a job teaching in Sheffield where he was tasked by SWP founder Tony Cliff with building the IS branch. Key activities included involvement in a council rent strike in 1967. He also helped draw rank and file miners to the organisation during the strikes of 1972 and 1974.</p>

<p>He even met Che Guevara and other leaders of the Cuban revolution in 1961 after putting his navy service to political use to sign up on a Greek ship travelling to Havana.</p>

<p>Nick is fondly remembered for introducing Marxist politics to a generation of miners and steelworkers through working as a tutor and lecturer on adult education day-release courses at Sheffield University from 1964 to 1997.</p>

<p>He carried out maritime research which took him to Rio de Janeiro, Lisbon, C&#225;diz, Hamburg, Helsinki, Rostock and Warnem&#252;nde. Other works include the history of the steelworkers&#8217; unions, a study of the Puddlers&#8217; Unions in the 1860s and a study on teaching art therapy.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/special/nickhoward" target="new">Nick Howard Papers</a>, kept by Sheffield University, contain a wide-ranging body of documents and sound recordings relating to Nick&#8217;s research on the blockade of Germany after World War I and the influenza pandemic. They also have his interviews with Wilhelm Necker, financial director of the Bauhaus, and contributions to a series of radio programmes for <em>BBC Radio Sheffield</em> on the history of the labour movement in the Sheffield region.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Argued</h4>

<p class="fst">Nick had his own ideas, always argued his own position and stuck to his guns whatever the circumstances. His active participation in Sheffield Pensioners&#8217; Action Group in the face of political opponents is just one example of that.</p>

<p>You could not fall out with Nick. He was as generous in discussion as he was as a comrade and friend. Politics was his life until the end. He hoped to live to see Jeremy Corbyn re-elected as Labour leader.</p>

<p>As Sheffield comrades know only too well, he would politely ignore whoever was chairing a meeting to make his point. In his memory this article should probably go on longer, like his always insightful, but lengthy, contributions. That kindly, passionate influence will be sadly missed.</p>

<p class="fst">Commiserations from Sheffield comrades to his partner Jenny, daughters Rachel and Rebecca and son Luke.</p>
