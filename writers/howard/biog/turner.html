<p class="fst">My friend Nick Howard, who has died aged 83, witnessed revolution around the world in the 1950s when he served in the merchant navy for 10 years.</p>

<p>Born in Marylebone, London, the son of Thomas, a clerk of works, and Tusha (n&#223;e Bravo), who worked at one of the first Marie Stopes clinics, Nick was a war evacuee, leaving Munster Road primary school in Fulham to attend a village elementary school near Guildford, Surrey. He then went to Royal Guildford grammar school on a scholarship, before joining the merchant navy aged 16.</p>

<p>In 1956, he was working as a ship&#8217;s officer and navigator sailing in the Suez Canal on the day the Egyptian leader, Nasser, nationalised it. &#8220;Gentlemen, you&#8217;re now working for Colonel Nasser,&#8221; Nick recalled an Egyptian officer telling the crew. Nick refused to serve on a British government supply ship after war broke out. On an earlier trip his ship docked at Buenos Aires in Argentina just as huge crowds were turning out for a mass rally in support of Eva Per&#243;n. A further ship he served on was &#8220;arrested&#8221; during a US-backed rebellion against President Sukarno in Indonesia.</p>

<p>Such events politicised Nick. He left the sea after taking part in a strike by members of his seafarers&#8217; union over conditions. In 1961 he returned to the waves by signing up for a Greek ship travelling to Havana, where he met Che Guevara and other leaders of the Cuban revolution.</p>

<p>Nick then worked in a maritime library before studying at the London School of Economics, where he joined the International Socialists, the forerunner of the Socialist Workers party. After graduating in 1964, he got a job teaching in Sheffield, where he was tasked by Tony Cliff, a founding member of the SWP, to build a branch of the International Socialists. Nick became involved in a council rent strike in 1967 and helped draw miners to the IS during the strikes of 1972 and 1974. Working as a tutor and lecturer in adult education at Sheffield University until 1997, he introduced Marxist politics to a generation of miners and steelworkers on day-release courses.</p>

<p>Nick also carried out research in to the maritime industry, which took him to Rio de Janeiro, Lisbon, C&#225;diz, Hamburg, Helsinki, Rostock and Warnem&#252;nde. He also wrote essays on the history of the steelworkers&#8217; unions, the puddlers&#8217; (ironworkers&#8217;) unions in the 1860s and a study on teaching art therapy. The <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/special/nickhoward" target="new">Nick Howard Papers</a>, held by Sheffield University, include documents and sound recordings relating to his research on the blockade of Germany after the first world war, as well as contributions to programmes for <em>BBC Radio Sheffield</em> on the history of the labour movement. In later life he was an active member of the Sheffield Pensioners Action Group.</p>

<p>He is survived by his wife, Jenny, and by his children, Rachel, Rebecca and Luke, from his marriage to Ann Howard, which ended in divorce.</p>
