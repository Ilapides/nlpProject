<h1>Stalin&#8217;s Slave Laborers</h1>

<h4>The Extent and Significance of a Modern Phenomenon</h4>

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade />
<p class="fst">History records no greater crime than that of the Stalinist regime
in its treatment of the victims in the concentration camps. Hitler&#8217;s
methods were not original. They ran parallel with, if they were not
mere copies of those utilized by Stalin. If Hitler sent millions of
people, primarily the Jews, into the gas chambers, the Russian camps
have crushed, dehumanized and done to death more victims than all
other concentration camps combined. For a time the war brought a
decrease in the slave labor population of the <em>lagiers</em>, as
Stalin&#8217;s hell-holes are called. But this was only because the
Kremlin found it necessary to use many of the male prisoners as a
stopgap in the front lines, where they were quickly mowed down. This
was part of the price paid by Russia for Stalin&#8217;s being taken by
surprise despite all the warnings that the Nazis would invade Russia.
The end of the war once again reversed the trend. The far-away
Siberian wastes are filling up anew. The slave labor enterprises of
the MVD (the GPU) are operating full blast. There is, nevertheless, a
distinct difference so far as the outside world is concerned.</p>

<p>The Iron Curtain has been definitively pierced. The war broke down
the frontiers so zealously watched by the Stalinist border guards.
Masses of people were hurled across the boundaries, first one way,
then the other. Hundreds of thousands of Poles, among others, more
than half of whom were Jews, fled before Hitler&#8217;s armies in 1939
into Stalin&#8217;s share of Poland. The Russian criminal code forbade
entry into Soviet territory without proper credentials. What did it
matter that the boundaries had been shifted arbitrarily overnight!
That irony was only deepened by the clause in the &#8220;most democratic
of all Constitutions,&#8221; Stalin&#8217;s own, which specifically set aside
any punishment in case anyone was forced to flee across the borders
as the result of political or religious persecution. The Polish
refugees were arrested, imprisoned for months, then sent to hard
labor in Siberia for three to eight years. This applied to old and
young, the feeble and the strong, worker and bourgeois. The invasion
of Russia in 1941 paved the way for the agreement with the Polish
government in exile headed by Sikorski to build a Polish army on
Russian soil. This made it possible for those who had survived &#8211;
and they were a minority &#8211; to return ultimately to Western Europe.
The testimony of these people concerning the <em>lagiers</em> and slave
labor in Russia has only begun to be poured out to the world. There
are in addition many Russians, some who had been prisoners of war,
some slave laborers for the Germans, others Red Army deserters, who
resist all attempts to force their return to the &#8220;Fatherland.&#8221;
The experiences of these Russians under Stalinism are destined to
make a deep imprint on world opinion in the coming period. Humanity
has, to all appearances, remained quite indifferent over a period of
years to the stifled cry of slave laborers of the GPU. The evidence
of the frightful conditions maintained in the <em>lagiers</em> came out
before the outbreak of the war in a thin trickle only. But the fog
created by Stalinist propaganda is being dissipated by the
quantitative weight of unimpeachable testimony. Hitler and Mussolini
have disappeared from the scene, leaving behind only the despicable
Franco. Now the workers of the world will be brought face to face
with the Soviet dictator Stalin and his methods.</p>

<p>The change in attitude bound to come in world opinion will be due
only in part to the wider evidence of the truth concerning Russian
concentration camps. It will also be due to the chilling of the
political atmosphere which has already begun. There is a certain
similarity in this sense with the attitude shown toward Hitler. The
brutalities practiced by the Nazis first of all on the German
workers, later more horribly on the Jews, were known to the diplomats
and to the molders of opinion in the capitalist world. That world
accepted the sacrifice of the Jewish masses in its stride so long as
Hitler was carrying through the counter-revolution in Germany. It was
only when Hitler turned his attention outward against the rival
imperialists that the latter developed humanitarian feeling about
Nazi atrocities. These &#8220;feelings,&#8221; having served their temporary
political purpose, have long since been discarded. There is somewhat
of an analogy, within limits, in the attitude toward Stalin. The
ruling strata of the rest of the world viewed with undisguised
satisfaction the bloody annihilation of the older Russian
revolutionary generation by the Kremlin bureaucracy. Stalin was
laying the ghost of the revolution; the sympathies of the capitalist
world were with him, not with his victims. But Stalin is now pressing
outward and the feelings of the great power politicians are being
ruffled. Soon these imperialist spokesmen will begin to discover the
awful plight of the starved and beaten victims in the Russian
<em>lagiers</em>. The tone of disinterestedness, even of equanimity,
with which the previous revelations were received, will give way to
another wave of humanitarianism.</p>

<p>How is it that the working class has not lifted its voice against
the inhuman cruelties of the terror regime in the Russian slave
camps? The answer would have to include a full history of the
confusion introduced into the ranks of the workers everywhere by
Stalinism. Those who come out of Russia to live abroad after
suffering the tortures of the damned in the <em>lagiers</em> express
utter astonishment at the inability of people to comprehend what is
taking place under Stalin&#8217;s rule. T.S. Eliot speaks in his
introduction to the powerful book, <strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong>,
of the power of planned ignorance. This is indeed the role of
Stalinism. But Eliot fails to mention that, with all the cunning
disinformation created by the Kremlin, with all the aid from the
Communist Parties and their fellow travelers abroad, there had to be
also a certain amount of connivance on the part of the capitalist
world across the frontiers to maintain the Iron Curtain.</p>

<p>The title of the book itself gives part of the explanation of the
difficulty for the truth to find its way to the masses. It was Arthur
Koestler who referred to the vastness of Siberia with its exiled
millions as being as &#8220;remote from the Western observer as the dark
side of the moon from the star-gazer&#8217;s telescope.&#8221; The anonymous
Polish woman who has condensed thousands of documents written by the
Poles released from the Russian concentration camps, adopted her
title from this expression. The sympathies of the writer, an adherent
of the former London exiled Polish government, point in a direction
not palatable to the radical of whatever shade. But the facts she
presents are absolutely incontrovertible. She writes with utmost
objectivity and with surprising restraint. This book must be read by
every person who wishes to know about Russia. Every single document
of the unfortunate Poles, and they come from all walks of life, makes
clear that what they endured was not something unique or special.
They participated in the common experience of the millions upon
millions of Russians in the same camps. The Poles could at least
sustain themselves on the faintest of hopes that some day they would
again return to civilization. But the Russians were sunk in complete,
unrelieved despair, for so long as the Stalin regime endured there
was not the slightest hope that any of them would ever again return
from exile. The stark fate of these lost souls beggars all the
horrors that one can imagine, all that have ever been imagined in
literature. Stalin practices cannibalism not in its literal sense,
but just as surely in the sense of devouring the flesh and bones of
living humanity in the form of slave labor.</p>

<p>There was one practice among others that Stalin and Hitler had in
common. Their armies carried with them in their conquests lists of
&#8220;undesirables&#8221; who were to be arrested immediately. It is hardly
surprising that both lists were headed by revolutionists. First on
Stalin&#8217;s lists were Trotskyists, members of pre-revolutionary
parties such as the Mensheviks, the Social Revolutionaries and
anarchists. One such list that fell into foreign hands had fourteen
categories. The eighth included refugees and political emigres from
other countries; the tenth any persons who had traveled abroad. Last
of all came aristocrats, landowners, wealthy merchants, bankers and
industrialists. Stalinism reintroduced Asiatic justice into Russia,
for it takes not individuals who are wanted but their entire
families. It goes even further. In the course of raids on some house
or other in search of an individual, frequently enough the GPU
arrested everybody in the house for whatever reason. The mass
deportations from Poland were planned by the CPU in four great waves:
in February, April and June of 1940, and again in June, 1941. The
first waves caught in the net representatives of all political
parties of whatever shade of opinion, including the leaders of all
Polish, White Russian, Ukrainian and Jewish socialist organizations
and of socialist trade unions, members of working-class committees,
organizers of working class, peasant and other youth institutions.
The utter cynicism of these &#8220;purges&#8221; is summed up in that which
took place in June 1941. Up to that time the GPU had utilized local
committees of Communists and sympathizers, and even workers&#8217;
militias. These local Communists had often enough helped choose those
to be deported to Siberia. Their own turn came last! All those who
had had any kind of dealings whatsoever directly with the Red Army,
all known Communists, were shipped off in the fourth series of raids.
What a curious light (let us say it mildly) this throws on the policy
advocated by some Trotskyists to have Polish workers in partisan
militias place themselves under the direct command of the Red Army
generals! That policy certainly facilitated the task of the GPU of
uprooting every vestige of working-class independence.</p>

<p>The description of the deportation trains is poignant and tragic
beyond words. The utter indifference to considerations of common
humanity evinced by the Red Army guards is a measure of the
dehumanizing effects of life under Stalinism. The Poles thought first
that this was due to the Russian hatred of Poland. Not at all!</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It was still very difficult for people coming from
outside the Union to understand that such things could be everyday
sights; that members of these people&#8217;s own families, their fellow
workers or neighbors, might as easily have been transported in
similar trains to similar destinations ... It was still some time
before they understood that all this was not some otherwise
unheard-of proceeding against themselves as foreigners, but that the
whole system and the institutions to which they were being taken had,
in fact, come into existence and continued to exist as a normal part
of life for Soviet citizens.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">All Russian literature of Czarist times &#8211; it is the profound
contribution of that literature to the world &#8211; is permeated with
the deepest feelings of humanity, to the very point of inward
torture. Stalinism has, at least outwardly, registered its greatest
success in creating the complete atomizing of society in place of
solidarity. Each is intent on his own salvation and is trained by
terror to show utter lack of any concern for the suffering of his
neighbor. This is true of ordinary life. It is trebly so in the
<em>lagiers</em> where the sheer problem of survival brutalizes every
living soul. A survivor gives this description of the long march from
the detraining center to the camp:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;A nineteen-year-old boy with blood pouring from his
lungs, fell for the last time and was so savagely beaten with rifles
that, in the words of the witness reporting it, &#8216;he was beaten into
the ground.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Since law meant nothing at all, the GPU being a law unto itself,
everything was arbitrary. The crowding of prisoners in trains, then
in prison cells, was something incredible, a country-wide practice of
the black hole of Calcutta. Is it surprising that in prisons also the
terms used by the wardens have become once again identical with those
used in Czarist times? A well-known Socialist sums up the treatment
of prisoners as follows: &#8220;The prisoner is to get it into his head
as soon as possible that he is nothing but a thing and that nobody
has any reason to be particular about the way he treats him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stalinism is shown at its &#8220;purest&#8221; in the slave labor camps.
Here is the final outcome of the GPU system. The Russian prisoners
have a saying: &#8220;Nobody leaves <em>lagier</em> behind. <em>Lagier</em>
is forever!&#8221; Yet occasionally a medical commission makes the rounds
and releases from labor the total wrecks who have not yet died.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In September and October 1941, a medical commission
from Magadan visited some of the Kolyma mining and lumber camps. A
long procession of human phantoms appeared in the town and were put
into ships. Those who saw them go aboard could hardly believe they
were human. It was a procession not of human beings, but of corpses
and trunks. The majority had neither noses, lips nor ears; very many
were armless and legless. Among these was a handful only of Poles.
The rest were all Soviet citizens. The Magadan commission had
recognized them as being unfit for work! In Magadan it was said that,
once aboard ship, they were taken out to sea and drowned, but there
is not any proof of this.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">There is a Soviet &#8220;opera&#8221; unknown to the rest of the world. It
is just the kind of grotesque and gruesome occurrence that one would
expect under the rule of Stalin. In many of the camps the slave
laborers are accompanied to work each morning by a Russian orchestra!
The prisoners sing to its accompaniment a mournful dirge:</p>

<table align="center" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">&#8221;And if you don&#8217;t accomplish the norm<br/>
They give you only three hundred grams of bread.&#8221;</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">Food is distributed by &#8220;Kettle,&#8221; of which four or more
categories are prescribed, from the punishment kettle up to the
special kettle of the trustee. The kettle depends upon the amount of
work accomplished, the unit being an impossible norm rarely if ever
achieved. The slaves must put in twelve hours of hard labor besides
the hours of exhausting marching to and from the places of work.
After the invasion of Russia by the Nazis, there were never any free
days. No political prisoners were allowed to hold any sort of
administrative posts, even the most minor. Such posts when held by
prisoners were given to the common criminals of the underworld. These
brigade leaders became bestial slave drivers in order to protect
their own few privileges, above all those connected with food. One
survived, under a system bound to be corrupt from top to bottom, only
through &#8220;<em>blat</em>,&#8221; inadequately translated as graft.</p>

<p>It is the extent of the slave labor camps that freezes one&#8217;s
blood as much as the unmitigated blackness of their administration.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;From this first-hand evidence it is known that vast
regions about Kuibyshev, in northern Siberia and in Kazakstan, with,
to the north, the whole of the Komi Republic up to Archangel, with
Novaya Zemlya, have camps of this kind along almost every kilometer.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In all this territory the MVD holds complete sway. There exist
only guards and guarded! This tremendous GPU state is divided into
zones, each territory enclosed within barbed wire, patrolled by armed
guards and their dogs, and made doubly secure by lookout towers and
storks&#8217; nests containing sentries. The population of these camps
has never been divulged but is estimated anywhere from ten to twenty
millions of souls. All these slaves are engaged in the building of
canals, railroads, roads and bridges, factories, towns, ports,
mining, forest clearing, or in cultivating gigantic state farms of
ten to twenty thousand hectares.</p>

<p>The concentration camps of Stalin, euphemistically called
&#8220;corrective labor camps,&#8221; are the index of the fear in the hearts
of the Russian rulers, and of the terror required to hold down the
Russian population. A regime built on measures of this kind and on so
vast a scale is inevitably one of profound crisis. But like all such
phenomena, it takes on an independent development of its own with its
own &#8220;vested interests.&#8221; It is a source of vast profit to the
state rulers and to the GPU. The Gulag, the labor camp
administration, tries to fill in the glaring gaps due to failures in
the bureaucratic five-year plans. The interstices of these plans,
based on the most intense exploitation of the Russian proletariat,
are cemented with slave labor outright. The turnover of labor in the
giant clusters of camps is an important factor to be reckoned with in
its effects on Russian life. Twenty to thirty per cent of deaths each
year in the mines of the Far East and the Far North are common. Those
who are released after serving their terms, are required to stay put
in the places of exile, but are still counted as &#8220;lost&#8221; to the
GPU. Replacements are ordered by the Gulag from the country-wide
collection centers. Kravchenko showed how these demands from above
influence arrests and rearrests on any available pretext or none at
all. In colonial days the English resorted to impressment for their
navy or for colonizing of the New World. But never in all history has
there been outright enslavement in any country on such a scale. <strong>Uncle
Tom&#8217;s Cabin</strong> made a great appeal against the separation of
families under slavery. This is a commonplace of Soviet life. In fact
there is a special camp in the Karaganda cluster in Central Asia
known as the &#8220;Wives&#8217; Camp&#8221; and used for the wives and widows of
former Soviet leaders.</p>

<p>It is clear why Stalin needs an Iron Curtain. He has much to hide.
Not all that he would like to keep hidden has to do with military
secrets. When the Poles began their trek back after their belated
release &#8211; the big majority of them remain buried in Russian earth &#8211;
Stalin did his best to force them to become Soviet citizens in order
not to let them out with the information they possessed. Stalin
claimed that the Jews taken from Poland were Soviet citizens (as in
the case of Ehrlich and Alter). He finally permitted the one hundred
and fifty thousand of them, survivors of over half a million, to
emigrate. The loss to the camps in this process was made up with
German, Italian and Japanese prisoners of war. It was also made up
with those Russian prisoners of war who were repatriated from Western
Europe, those of them who were not shot outright for having committed
the crime of seeing too much of the outside world. Stalin is fearful
concerning the Russians who have fled abroad, including a large
number of Red Army deserters. They may become the new centers of
resistance, just as did the exiles under the Czar.</p>

<p>The challenge to humanity that exists in such glaring form in the
Russian slave labor camps cannot be ignored without extreme peril to
the working class of the entire world. If it is the workers
everywhere who must free themselves and all the oppressed, it is
certainly the workers of all other countries who must come to the aid
of the workers ground into the dust in Russia. There are those who
would remain silent on this question because they fear that any
agitation against Russian slave labor will become a weapon in the
hands of the imperialists who seek in time to wage war on Russia.
There is no better weapon with which to arm these imperialists than
working class silence on this life-and-death matter. If the vanguard
of the workers is unable to rally the working class in fierce protest
against such inhumanity, then reaction will seize on the issue for
its own purposes at a suitable time. To fail to raise this issue
without let-up because of a fear that reaction will profit from it
means only that one does not know how to make use of the issue in
Marxist fashion. Silence means to participate in the worst crime in
all history. It is hard to believe that the working class, with the
facts already known, can allow another May Day to pass without the
cry: &#8220;Down with Stalin&#8217;s slave labor camps!&#8221;</p>

<p>We Trotskyists owe a special duty to those comrades who gave so
heroic an example to the world (it is now revealed in the testimony
gathered by S. Mora and P. Zwierniak in <strong>La Justice Sovi&#233;tique</strong>,
as quoted by the Menshevik Dallin, whose factual gathering of
material is most praiseworthy, though his motives fall under the
shadow of imperialism) at the camp in Vorkuta. Several dozen of them,
while they were still together, &#8220;decided to eternalize the people&#8217;s
memory of them by a last manifestation of their inflexible will, and
thus remain victorious even if condemned to hard labor.&#8221; They
presented demands claiming the right of political prisoners to be
separated from the criminals, the right to be employed only for work
corresponding to their professions, and the right not to be
separated. They then started a hunger strike until success or death,
a hunger strike lasting for 120 days without interruption! Many died
despite forced feeding.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;When all the efforts to break their spirit proved
ineffective, the Trotskyites were separated with the help of a pack
of fierce dogs unleashed in their barracks.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">All were certainly shot later. The memory of these brave ones is
surely eternal! Their challenge to us must be met.</p>

<p>The Russian phenomenon of slave labor is a challenge also to our
theories. Never forget that the camps control vast sections (states
within a state) of &#8220;nationalized property.&#8221; This nationalized
property &#8211; mines, factories, forests, railroads &#8211; is completely
in the hands of the GPU. Such nationalized property has become
completely identified with direct state slave labor. It is a kind of
&#8220;pure form&#8221; of the tendency that exists under completely
reactionary Stalinism. It is the most urgent warning that the mere
words &#8220;nationalized property&#8221; or any formula using these mere
words without complete and concrete analysis is dangerous and
misleading. Nationalized property under Stalinism, in or out of the
concentration camps, is permitted to serve the masses not in the
slightest degree. Our deepest sympathies go everywhere to the
exploited and oppressed masses. We defend them, their welfare, their
conquests, not those of the privileged and exploiting minority. The
concentration camps in Russia with their millions of forced laborers,
are an important part of the evidence that the nationalized property
taken by the masses in the October Revolution, has been wrested
completely from the hands of the working class. That property today
serves the interests of the rulers completely. The Wall aces, fearful
of any new revolution inside Russia because such a revolution will
endanger the entire capitalist system which they defend, shut their
eyes to the existence of bestial slave labor in Russia. But only such
a revolution can free the millions of political prisoners from the
<em>lagiers</em> and prisons. Only such a revolution can restore the
nationalized property to the masses from whom it was usurped. The
American working class can help their suffering Russian brothers and
sisters along the path to the renewal of the socialist revolution by
protesting in one mighty voice against the retention of the
concentration camps for slave labor in Russia.</p>
