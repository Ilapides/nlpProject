<p class="fst"><strong>The Great Conspiracy</strong><br/>
by Michael Sayers and Albert E. Kahn<br/>
<em>Little, Brown &amp; Co., $3.60</em></p>

<p class="fst">It is far from coincidence that the lurid volume called <strong>The
Great Conspiracy</strong> appears just after the announcement that
Trotsky&#8217;s book on Stalin would appear this April. The Stalinists
had their copy of the work on Stalin when it was first issued for
review and then withdrawn. It was easy for them, with their
connections in the publishing field, to secure foreknowledge of the
exact date of release of the book that was banned by the State
Department for four years.</p>

<p><strong>The Great Conspiracy</strong> is hardly the work of Sayers and Kahn
alone. They had every kindly assistance from the GPU. The book is a
calculated attempt once again to confuse public opinion. Its obvious
intent is to counteract beforehand the profound effect that Trotsky&#8217;s
new exposure of the totalitarian dictator in the Kremlin must
inevitably create. The Stalin work, soberly based on the most
critical analysis of real documents, not blatant frauds, will be the
best answer to the GPU and its hacks. The dispassionate, scientific
spirit evident in. the writing of Leon Trotsky, even when he deals
with Stalin, the most sinister and terrible figure in all history,
dissolves into nothingness the transparent attempt to characterize
Trotsky as almost demented in his &#8220;personal&#8221; hatred of Stalin.
Sayers and Kahn write:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;He wrote articles asserting that the Soviet leader
derived sadistic pleasure from &#8216;blowing smoke&#8217; in the faces of
infants. More and more, his consuming, personal hatred of Stalin
became the dominating force of Trotsky&#8217;s life. He sets his
secretaries to work on a massive, vituperative 1,000-page life of Stalin.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">No, the dominating force of Trotsky&#8217;s life was to guide the
working class toward the achievement of socialism and to help it on
this course by means of complete truth and clarity.</p>

<p>These Stalinist word-men attempt to mask their major objective by
appearing to deal with a broader theme, the secret plotting of war
and intervention against the Soviet Union during the last twenty-five
or more years. This affords them, the opportunity to &#8220;set the
stage,&#8221; to heighten the atmosphere to the proper degree of
saturation with intrigue, assassination and betrayal. The fetid
breath of the underworld of imperialist politics is breathed on the
Moscow Trials in a vain effort to give them life. Trotsky and the Old
Bolsheviks are bracketed on the one side with the British agent,
Lockhart, the &#8220;master spy,&#8221; Reilly, the White Guardists, Kolchak,
Denikin, Wrangel and Yudenitch; on the other with the Nazis and
fascists and imperialist reactionaries of all lands. The Stalinists
dare not desist in their clumsy effort to force a vast and fantastic
amalgam down the throat of history.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Scholarly Research &#8211; Stalinist Style</h4>

<p class="fst">How can one doubt when there is such an air of scholarly research
about this Great Conspiracy? Just look at the staggering load of
books, papers, documents that went under the heavy mental press of
the authors to be so richly condensed! There are those delightful
footnotes too that do not disturb the even flow of the &#8220;main theme&#8221;
(the complete Stalinist line to date), and yet add just the right
pinch of &#8220;fairness&#8221; in alluding, in small print to be sure, to
works that utterly refute the text on the Moscow Trials. With what an
engaging air of bland innocence do the writers inform us:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;None of the incidents or dialogue in <strong>The Great
Conspiracy</strong> has been invented by the authors. The material has
been drawn from various documentary sources which are indicated in
the text or listed in the <em>Bibliographical Notes</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This list includes official records of the United States State
Department, hearings and reports of Congressional committees,
official British documents, biographies, newspapers, books and &#8211;
&#8220;the verbatim reports published by the Soviet government of the
proceedings at the espionage, sabotage and treason trials which have
taken place in Soviet Russia since the Revolution.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taken as official documents, after all, are not those of the
Soviet government just as good and authentic as those of other
governments? That na&#239;ve logic will influence, of course, only na&#239;ve
people. The truth of any document rests on itself and all its
relations to facts, events and other documents. The Sisson documents
became for a brief spell official United States affairs &#8211; until
their fraudulent nature became so obvious that they had to be thrown
out as forgeries. Those documents &#8211; what irony in relation to the
Moscow Trials! &#8211; purported to show that both Lenin and Trotsky were
mere German agents. To this day the trial records exist showing the
conviction for murder of Sacco and Vanzetti. Yet not a single
thinking person accepts their conclusion, although on their basis
these two martyrs were executed. The Mooney trial is another case in
point. The Dreyfus affair is also part of history. Yet objection will
be made that there were no confessions in these trials. But the
history of the Inquisitions presents the most fantastic confessions
of all time and who today, including the fathers of the Church, would
quote as truth those old &#8220;official&#8221; documents. Indeed the nearest
analogy to the Moscow Trials is precisely that of the Witch Trials of
the Inquisition. Sayers and Kahn mention but completely ignore the
conclusions of the Dewey Commission that all the Moscow Trials were
false, and an attempt to frame up Leon Trotsky. These Stalinist
scholars, in short, make not the slightest faint effort to analyze or
sift or weigh the documents that they choose to present. Their
assigned task is to narrate the proper versions.</p>

<p>We readily agree that the Stalinist writers did not invent
anything themselves. They merely use the inventions of Stalin and his
GPU from start to finish. But if they are ordinary copyists in this
respect, they have nevertheless the proper light-fingered touch in
their use of material. A minor detail will reveal that &#8220;slant&#8221; on
&#8220;documents.&#8221; They quote Lenin at the Congress of Soviets in
December, 1920, as calling for the New Economic Policy and then
advocating the speedy electrification of the country.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There was a huge map of Russia on the platform. At a
signal from Lenin, a switch was touched and the map was suddenly
illuminated. It showed the Congress how Lenin envisaged the future of
his country. Electric lights sparkled on the map.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This scene is taken &#8220;verbatim&#8221; from a motion picture of rather
late Stalinist vintage. It never existed in this form and is
obviously entirely out of keeping with Lenin&#8217;s simplicity. The mind
of Lenin needed no &#8220;shows&#8221;!<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Lie Spread Backward</h4>

<p class="fst">Stalin has carried &#8220;The Lie&#8221; back so as to make it appear that
the struggle against his Thermidorean apparatus was the continuation
of an older struggle carried on against Lenin. Trotsky is to be
exiled, if Stalin has his way, not only from Russia but from all
history. Thus they would like to make it appear that Trotsky was
opposed to Lenin on the New Economic Policy. In reality it was
Trotsky who had first proposed such a change to Lenin a year before
its adoption. The authors repeat with their instructors: &#8220;When
Lenin announced the &#8216;temporary retreat&#8217; of the New Economic
Policy, Trotsky exclaimed: The cuckoo has cuckooed the end of the
Soviet government!&#8221; Trotsky&#8217;s speech shows that he, with Lenin,
considered the move a temporary retreat. The expression is evidently
torn out of context and given a distorted meaning, for Trotsky
understood that the Whites abroad would hail the new policy as the
end of the regime. It was they would would &#8220;cuckoo&#8221; the end of
the regime, not Trotsky.</p>

<p>The greatest contempt for the reader is revealed in the deliberate
confusing of terms and times, indicating the reliance of the
Stalinists on sheer ignorance. The word &#8220;opposition&#8221; is made a
catch-all to link together an the oppositions that existed at various
times on different issues and with different persons involved.
Specifically the attempt is constantly made to link up every other
opposition with the Left Opposition which was established on the eve
of Lenin&#8217;s death not as an opposition to Lenin (as Stalin wants it
to appear) but, on the contrary, to become the instrument of both
Lenin and Trotsky against Stalin. Lenin died before the fight to
remove Stalin (as proposed by Lenin to Trotsky) could be started.
Trotsky then continued the struggle through the Left Opposition as a
faction within the Communist Party. Sayers and Kahn commit the fraud
of insinuating and then accepting as authentic the identity of the
Left Opposition with the Left Communists who opposed Lenin during and
after the peace of Brest-Litovsk, and with other oppositionist
groupings that existed be fore Lenin&#8217;s death. This projection
backward in history is the rotten fruit of the later Moscow Trials in
which all the oppositions, right and left, are lumped together and
made to appear as a united group from the very start, fighting first
Lenin and then, by inheritance, Stalin. One form of The Lie is given
as follows: &#8220;First as Foreign Commissar and then as War Commissar,
Trotsky was the chief spokesman of the so-called Left Opposition
within the Bolshevik Party.&#8221; The Left Opposition led by Trotsky did
not exist when he was Foreign Commissar and began only after Lenin
died. History is thus again and again ante-dated in accord with the
needs of the later frame-ups.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Will of Lenin</h4>

<p class="fst">The question of &#8220;inheritance&#8221; brings to mind the famous &#8220;will&#8221;
of Lenin. The authors, in line with the needs of <strong>The Great
Conspiracy</strong> against Trotsky and Bolshevism, arrive this late at
the denial that such a testament existed. Naturally, since it is so
damning to Stalin&#8217;s pretensions at being the follower and disciple
of Lenin. The teacher took exceptional care in this instance to
disown the &#8220;pupil&#8221;! There is the letter in which Lenin broke off
all relations with Stalin. There is also the testament urging the
party to remove Stalin as general secretary. These scribblers know
how to omit real documents and to hide the fact that Stalin was
forced to produce the testament and have it read before the Central
Committee of the Bolshevik Party in 1927. More flagrantly they leave
in darkness Stalin&#8217;s own admission published in the official organ
of the Comintern, the <strong>International Press Correspondence</strong> for
November 17, 1927. A speech of Stalin&#8217;s is there quoted as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is said that in the &#8216;testament&#8217; in question
Lenin suggested to the party that it should deliberate on the
question of replacing Stalin and appointing another comrade in his
place as general secretary of the party. This is perfectly true.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The other comrade was to be one whose qualities Lenin posed in
sharp contrast to those of the &#8220;rude and disloyal&#8221; Stalin.</p>

<p>You will look in vain in this &#8220;historical study&#8221; for the
replica of another document in which Lenin showed such complete trust
in the Commissar of War, Trotsky. It was given without request during
the Civil War when Trotsky was meeting with opposition engineered
from behind the scenes by Stalin. Trotsky never used the document
which was a blank sheet of paper with an endorsement at the bottom
signed by Lenin, as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Comrades: Knowing the strict character of Comrade
Trotsky&#8217;s orders, I am so convinced, so absolutely convinced, of
the correctness, expediency and necessity for the success of the
cause of the order given by Comrade Trotsky that I unreservedly
indorse this order.</p>

<p class="fst">This simple document is enough in itself to refute all the frauds
and forgeries attempted by Stalin in his desperate effort to besmirch
the name of Lenin&#8217;s co-worker. The totalitarian dictator uses all
the weight of the government, all the power of the reactionary
bureaucracy, to recreate history in his own fell image. Psychologists
of the future will be faced with the problem of explaining why Stalin
found it necessary, after usurping the power of the October
Revolution, to try to have attributed to himself all the great deeds
of Trotsky while, on the contrary, attributing to Trotsky all the
murderous deeds of Stalin. <strong>The Great Conspiracy</strong> is but a new
effusion devoted to this ignoble task. Its shoddy structure can be
readily demolished by the truthful use of actual documents. The very
breadth of the fraud it attempts to perpetrate involves so many
contradictions internally as well as with well-established facts that
it is all the easier to expose.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Trotsky as Pictured in the Frame-Ups</h4>

<p class="fst">How could Stalin rest with the Moscow frame-up trials which tried
to picture Trotsky as plotting at one and the same time with France
and England, and with Germany and Italy against the Soviet Union, and
yet leave alone the Trotsky of the Revolution and the Civil War?
Trotsky himself predicted that the &#8220;plotting&#8221; attributed to him
would be carried back further and further to show him as a foreign
agent even under Lenin. Stalin found this all the more necessary in
order to convince the world that the struggle against him was really
the continuation of the same struggle against Lenin. Thus we have a
hobgoblin parade of bizarre fantasies, insinuations, innuendos,
distortions. What an amazing man, this Trotsky of the Great Stalin
Conspiracy! At one and the same time he is the agent of Germany
during Brest-Litovsk and yet plots with Anglo-American imperialism
through Lockhart and Reilly, not merely for intervention as against
Germany, but for outside aid in overthrowing Lenin! He is in
conspiracy with all of the defendants of the Moscow Trials at one and
the same time &#8211; with Bukharin and Rykov on one side, with Zinoviev
and Kamenev and Radek on the other, and with the Social
Revolutionaries of Left and Right, not to mention the White Guards
and Mensheviks. And all this support remains secret; it is never out
in the open. The Stalinists never stop to explain how such a Trotsky
needed anything more to displace Lenin, had he so desired, but the
majority in the ruling institutions of the period. The figures later
done to death by Stalin formed a majority of the Executive Committee
of the party as well as of the Soviet. There is one explanation, one
which casts shame on Lenin. Stalin pictures him as a dictator who,
like himself, kept all in check!</p>

<p>The startling talents of the imaginary Trotsky pictured by people
apparently suffering from nightmare, are shown after he has lost
power and is in exile. Let us quote from the Sayers-Kahn condensation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">From the moment Trotsky left Soviet soil, agents of
foreign intelligence services had been eager to contact him and to
make use of his international anti-Soviet organization. The Polish
Defensive; the Italian fascist Ovra; the Finnish Military
Intelligence; the White Russian &#233;migr&#233;s who directed anti-Soviet
secret services in Rumania, Yugoslavia and Hungary, and reactionary
elements with the British Intelligence Service and the French
Deuxième Bureau were all prepared to deal with Russia&#8217;s &#8220;Public
Enemy Number One&#8221; for their own purposes. Funds, assistants, a
network of espionage and courier services were at Trotsky&#8217;s
disposal for the maintenance and extension of his international
anti-Soviet propaganda activities and for the support and
reorganization of his conspiratorial apparatus inside Soviet Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">A powerful man, indeed! All the governments of the world ready to
support him in all kinds of ways &#8211; except one! A trifling detail.
They all unanimously declined to provide him with so simple a thing
as a haven, a refuge from which to carry on such multifarious
activities! England never invited him. He was driven out of France
and Norway after very brief sojourns. Germany allowed him in neither
before nor after the advent of Hitler to power. Only little Mexico
permitted his entry, and that under the exceptional period of
Cardenas&#8217; rule. Trotsky was and remained a man without a passport.
Is it possible. we ask somewhat timidly, in the light of the mass of
&#8220;evidence&#8221; so lavishly supplied by the GPU, that all these
governments had an even greater fear than Stalin of the power of the
revolutionary ideas of the co-founder of the October Revolution?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Study in Innuendo</h4>

<p class="fst">We highly recommend the book of the two historians of conspiracy
to every student of law as a source book in the study of innuendo.
Examples tumble over each other. Trotsky is quoted from the Dewey
Commission Report, <strong>The Case of Leon Trotsky</strong>, as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Monsieur Thome and Monsieur Cado, the general
secretary of the police and the prefecture of the Department of
Charente Int&#233;rieure-all the summits of the police were very well
acquainted with my situation. It was the secret agent of the police
who was informed of every step of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Clearly here is the admission of a link with the secret police of
France! The unsuspecting reader would never know that Trotsky was
forced to agree to report his every whereabouts to the French police
in order to be permitted to stay in France. Nor would it be inferred
from the quotation that Trotsky had demanded in his defense that the
French police make public all that they knew of his itinerary while
in France precisely in order to refute the charges hurled at him
during the Moscow Trials. Finally, let it be remembered, it was
precisely the Franco-Soviet Pact in existence during the trials, that
kept the mouths of the police firmly shut in aid of the &#8220;ally&#8221; of
France, Stalin.</p>

<p>There is unconscious humor in the purported conversation of
Rakovsky with a Japanese Intelligence officer in Japan, and in the
pictured plight of Ambassador Yurenev. The officer supposedly says to Rakovsky:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I must ask you to write to him (Trotsky) that our
government is dissatisfied with his articles on the Chinese question
and also with the behavior of the Chinese Trotskyites. We have a
right to expect a different line of conduct on the part of Mr.
Trotsky. Mr. Trotsky ought to understand what is necessary. There is
no need to go into details, but it is clear that an incident provoked
in China would be a desirable pretext for intervening in China.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Sadly the Moscow Trial of Rakovsky does not relate just how
Trotsky changed his writings on Japan and China to suit the Mikado.
It is, of course, a matter of record that he firmly supported the
Chinese against Japanese imperialism and predicted the defeat of
Japan. The innuendo in the quotation, as used, does not concern
Trotsky&#8217;s writings. It is rather the slur cast on the Chinese
Trotskyists that they somehow or other (the details are unnecessary!)
created the pretext for the Japanese penetration of China. These
drops of poison are never distilled any further.</p>

<p>Rakovsky supposedly reports these matters to Ambassador Yurenev.
By this time the stories concocted (at Moscow, not in Tokyo) have
reached such fantastic proportions as one lie piles up on the other
like a ship wrecked on the rocks, that comment on the contradictions
become unavoidable. The prosecutor therefore has a &#8220;depressed&#8221;
Yurenev saying to Rakovsky:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We have gotten into such a mess that sometimes one
does not know how to behave! One is afraid that by satisfying one of
our partners we may offend another. For instance, here at present
antagonism is rising between Great Britain and Japan in connection
with the Chinese question, while we have to maintain connections both
with the British and the Japanese Intelligence Services ... And here
I have to find my bearings in all this!&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Neither Vyshinsky nor Stalin could help them out of such a mess &#8211;
of lying testimony!<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Laying the Foundations &#8211; After the House Is Built</h4>

<p class="fst">The real service performed by this Stalinist manual lies in the
fact that it tries to bridge the glaring gaps left from one trial to
the next. Thus the evolution of The Lie becomes quite apparent. Each
trial witnessed &#8220;full and honest confessions&#8221; on the part of the
defendants brought into court. Yet each new trial went back over the
previous one to show that the confessions bringing convictions, even
of death, had not been one-tenth enough. This peculiarity of the
trials needed explanation. The explanation, need we say, we usually
even more fantastic than that which needed explaining. The trials
therefore present the appearance, with all the clever workmanship of
the writers after the fact, of constructing a house starting with the
roof and working down deeper and deeper into the foundations. Sayers
and. Kahn try to correct this weirdness by recounting the &#8220;relevant&#8221;
parts of the later trials before presenting the &#8220;verbatim&#8221;
accounts of the earlier ones. How stubborn real time can be in
refusing to reverse itself at the behest of the all-powerful GPU!</p>

<p>We are here concerned with the eight trials based on the Kirov
assassination in 1934. The previous trials of the Industrial Party
and the Mensheviks showed the same elements of frame-ups and
preparation for the later ones. The Menshevik Trial also reversed the
time order by showing &#8220;witnesses&#8221; meeting with two persons long
dead. It showed Abramovitch ignoring the laws of space by appearing
in Moscow when even the Soviet press had his picture as being in
Brussels. These are minor details which Sayers and Kahn feel no need
to discuss since they do not appear in the &#8220;official&#8221; versions of
the trials.</p>

<p>The eight trials were those of Nikolayev and others in December
1934; that of Zinoviev-Kamenev in January 1935; the trial of Medved
and other GPU men in January 1935; that of Kamenev and others in July
1935; the retrial of Zinoviev-Kamenev in August 1936; the Novosibirsk
trial of November 1936; the Pyatakov-Radek trial of January 1937; and
the Bukharin-Yagoda trial of March 1938.</p>

<p>The assassination of Kirov was followed by the death of 104 &#8220;white
guards.&#8221; The public was given to believe that the whites were
responsible for the plot. It came out in the course of the Nikolayev
trial, however, that he was a member of the Communist Youth
organization. The minutes of his trial were never published, but not
a single word at the time attempted to link the others with the plot.
A frame-up was tentatively tried, but quickly dropped. The indictment
stated that Nikolayev had been approached and helped by a Latvian
consul, Bisseneks. This consul offered to transmit a letter abroad to
Trotsky, with whom he claimed to be in touch. Nikolayev did not
write. Bisseneks disappeared abroad and was never heard of again.
Wisely, Sayers and Kahn ignore him completely. The GPU touch was too obvious.</p>

<p>Stalin next brought Zinoviev and Kamenev to trial in January 1935
for the same assassination. They were made to confess &#8220;moral guilt&#8221;
in helping to create an &#8220;atmosphere&#8221; in which terrorism could
breed. Not a word was said about actual complicity with Nikolayev;
not a word about terrorist plots; not a word about sabotage; and not
a single word about links with foreign governments. There followed
the trial of some Leningrad GPU men who had known about the plot to
kill Kirov in advance, but had failed to take proper precautions. The
minutes of this trial never appeared and it is not even mentioned by
our two scribblers. What did appear in no way implicated the GPU
officials of having participated in the actual plot. That came later.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Introduction of Sabotage</h4>

<p class="fst">Kamenev was dragged back from prison in July 1935 to face trial on
the same issue. This time he was accused of a terrorist plot against
Stalin. Nothing was published on this trial at all. Sayers and Kahn
do not mention it. It was a mere rehearsal for the later trials.
Zinoviev and Kamenev were again haled to court &#8211; from prison &#8211; in
August 1936. By this time they were ready to confess &#8211; no evidence
ever appeared, new or old &#8211; that they had participated in terrorist
plots, including that against Kirov. They were sentenced to death.
Here again not a single word appeared on sabotage or on links with
foreign governments to bring about intervention, etc.</p>

<p>Accusations of sabotage appeared for the first time in connection
with the Old Bolsheviks in the Novosibirsk Trial of November 1936.
Pyatakov appeared as defendant in this trial and in die later one of
January 1937. The last two trials added confessions not merely about
the defendants then alive, but also for the men already killed,
Zinoviev, Kamenev and others. They were charged after their death
with all the other crimes &#8220;admitted&#8221; for them by apparent
co-conspirators who had not even been tried with them. Pyatakov,
Bukharin, Radek &#8220;confessed&#8221; terrorist plots as in the previous
trials, but added sabotage, wrecking activities, treason abroad.</p>

<p><strong>The Great Conspiracy</strong> is an addition to the trials. It
relates them backward, giving the final version as an introduction to
the very first one. Its function becomes quite understandable. The
trial of Nikolayev is given in a single paragraph. Then we find the following:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Military Collegium sentenced Nikolayev to be shot.
Nikolayev did not divulge the fact that Zinoviev, Kamenev and the
other leaders of the Trotskyite-Zinovievite terrorist center had been
directly involved in the plot to murder Kirov.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Such a statement might strike one as a queer description of a
trial if there had not appeared on the preceding page a portion of
the &#8220;testimony&#8221; of the later trials used to link them together.
Bakayev in the 1936 trial &#8220;explains&#8221; this as due to instructions
from the ill-fated Zinoviev:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The principal task is to organize the terrorist work
so secretly as to preclude our being compromised in any way ... When
under examination, the main thing is to persistently deny any
connection with the organization. If accused of terroristic
activities, you must emphatically deny it and argue that terror is
incompatible with the views of Bolshevik-Marxists.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">If this &#8220;explains&#8221; Nikolayev&#8217;s silence, how does it explain
why Bakayev, released from all vows since Zinoviev and Kamenev had
confessed to their terrorist center themselves, did not reveal still
more? This contradiction at a later date required the invention of a
still more secret &#8220;parallel center&#8221; not mentioned at all in the
earlier trials.</p>

<p>The fore-shortened description of the first Zinoviev trial is
followed by its explanation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The trial had only scorched the surface of the
conspiracy. Among the many facts which the Leningrad trial failed to
bring to light, perhaps the strangest were these: When Zinoviev and
Kamenev were arrested, four agents of the Soviet secret police had
brought them to NKVD headquarters. The agents were Molchanov, chief
of the secret political department of the NKVD; Pauker, chief of the
operations department; Volovich, assistant chief of the operations
department; and Bulanov, assistant to the chairman of the NKVD. In
arresting Zinoviev and Kamenev, the four NKVD men acted in a most
extraordinary fashion. They not only failed to search the apartments
of the suspects for incriminating material; they actually permitted
Zinoviev and Kamenev to destroy a number of incriminating documents
... Still more remarkable were the records of these four NKVD agents.
Molchanov and Bulanov were themselves secret members of the
Trotskyite-Right conspiratorial apparatus. Pauker and Volovich were
German agents. These men had been specially picked to make the
arrests by Henry G. Yagoda, the Chairman of the NKVD.</p>

<p class="fst">Need we add that this &#8220;information&#8221; came at the later trial of
these GPU men and that Yagoda was tried only still later in March 1938?</p>

<p>It is a tenet of science to accept the simplest explanation, the
one involving the fewest number of assumptions. Stalin and his GPU,
unfortunately for their trials, paid not the slightest heed to this
well-recognized doctrine. That is why the trials left so sour a taste
and could not be swallowed by the world at large. The trials were
characterized by Trotsky as &#8220;conversations about conversations.&#8221;
Not a scintilla of actual evidence was ever produced. The &#8220;links&#8221;
between trials were intended as answers to world criticism on this
and other scores. The attempts to allay world suspicion in this
fashion were themselves so obvious and. so bizarre that they served
to confirm suspicion all the more. The hypothesis that the trials
were GPU frame-ups conformed too well to the known facts to be swept
aside. The defendants are all dead, Trotsky murdered in Mexico by a
tool of the GPU. The Stalinist need to have the world accept the
verdict of the trials remains. The Great Conspiracy against Trotsky
and the other leaders of the October Revolution continues. But its
brazenness is far from carrying conviction. The repetition of the
exploded lies concerning Pyatakov&#8217;s flight to Norway in an airplane
that never existed; the lies concerning a meeting between Trotsky and
Romm in Paris, when Trotsky proved he had not been in Paris at the
time; the lies about meetings in a <em>Hotel Bristol</em> in Copenhagen
that no longer existed at the time, etc. &#8211; all this calculated,
bare-faced effrontery convinces nobody.</p>

<p>Nobody? There are the Stalinists and their close collaborators,
the Browders, the Sayers and the Kahns. Browder, even after his
expulsion from the Communist Party, finds it necessary to reaffirm
his belief in the Moscow Trials. Sayers and Kahn have every
confidence in their verdicts, or so they say. These people should be
the very first to welcome every new opportunity to secure new,
objective corroboration of the trials. Such an opportunity presents
itself at this very time. The defendants at the later trials
confessed that they had made contact with the Nazis through Hess,
Rosenberg. and others. They gave &#8220;testimony&#8221; that Trotsky and his
son had met with Hess and plotted with the Nazis for war against the
Soviet Union. The Nuremberg Trials offer a new ground for a test of
the Moscow Trials. Not only are all the Nazi leaders, and
particularly those involved in the &#8220;confessions,&#8221; in the hands of
the Allies, but even better, all their archives seem to have fallen
intact into the hands of the Court. Will not Browder, Sayers, Kahn
and all the Friends of Stalin join in requesting the questioning of
these witnesses and the production in open court of all relevant
documents? It has been made clear through what has been produced,
that the Nazis, true Germans in this respect, kept the most
meticulous records of conversations and agreements. Why not ask the
defendants whether there ever were such records, and if so, what
became of them?</p>

<p>Not the Stalinists have made this request. They have remained as
silent as the grave on this matter, showing how much real confidence
they have in the possibilities of producing proof. It has remained
instead for the English section of the Fourth International to make
demands of this kind on the Court at Nuremberg. It has remained for
men like H.G. Wells and Arthur Koestler, James T. Farrell, Oswald
Garrison Willard and Norman Thomas &#8211; all of them disbelievers in
the Moscow Trials &#8211; to challenge the Russian prosecutor and the
Russian judge, who form part of the Nuremberg staff, to produce
proofs. There are those who fear that the Russians may make a &#8220;deal&#8221;
with the Nazis on this score. We fear nothing that the Stalinists can
do, for everything can be subjected to the same scientific, critical
analysis to which was subjected the material, or rather lack of
material, of the trials themselves.</p>

<p>The Stalinists must of necessity pile fraud on fraud to cover up
all the lies of the past. The Great Conspiracy is evidence that they
are impelled to drown with noise and bluster, with calumny and
innuendo &#8211; and with murder when no other remedy suffices &#8211; the
voices of truth and honesty. Let no one think that we speak here of
the Nazi scoundrels in the criminal dock at Nuremberg! Those beasts
deserve the death that will be meted out to them. But it is
nonetheless important that they be questioned before their sentence.
The Stalinists have too black a record for the suspicion not to arise
that after the death of the figures mentioned at the Moscow Trials,
documents will not be forged as the &#8220;proof&#8221; completely lacking at
the trials themselves. That is why it is necessary to demand that
questions be put to the men in the dock before their death. Every bit
of their testimony can be subjected to scientific analysis and
judgment, including anything they may say about documents bearing on
the case.</p>

<p>The world cannot forget the Moscow Trials. Their infamy remains a
dark blot on the conscience of humanity. The real verdict can only
come with the end of a regime, the regime of the totalitarian
bureaucracy headed by the Kremlin dictator. History will vomit forth
with the bloody clique that usurped the October Revolution, its own
image of fraud and frame-up as painted by itself in the Moscow
Trials. The vindication and victory of the Bolsheviks will be the
resurgence of the proletarian revolution dammed up by the Stalinists.</p>
