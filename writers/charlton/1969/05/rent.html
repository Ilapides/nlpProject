<p class="fst">DONCASTER:&ndash; 450 angry National Coal Board tenants met at the Scorethorpe Club, Bentley last week on the first stage of their campaign to resist the NCB&rsquo;s plan to raise rents by as much as &pound;1&nbsp;10s a week.</p>

<p>Messages of support were received from two of the largest collieries in the area, Broads worth and Bentley, and the meeting was heartened by the news that Armthorpe and Thumscoe tenants are still holding out against the Board after six months.</p>

<p>A militant resolution passed unanimously by the meeting called for a continuous fight through every stage of legal negotiations, followed if necessary by action at colliery level.</p>

<p>After the meeting, secretary of the Scorethorpe Tenants Action Committee, Jock Martin, said, &lsquo;I am confident that the tenants are so united by the Coal Board&rsquo;s greedy action that support for all necessary measures will be maintained until victory is won.&rsquo;</p>
