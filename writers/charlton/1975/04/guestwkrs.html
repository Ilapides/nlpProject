<p class="fst"><I><B>John Charlton</B> writes:</I><BR>AT PRESENT there are about
nine million migrant workers working in the EEC countries and
Switzerland &ndash; excluding internal migration (Southern Italians
working in the prosperous north). There are one million North
Africans, 850,000 Italians, 750,000 Irish, 500,000 Turks, 500,000
Yugoslavs, 500,000 Spanish, 500,000 Africans, 400,000 Indians and
Pakistanis, 400,000 West Indians and 300,000 Portuguese. Although
immigrants remit &pound;1,000 million per year to their country of
origin, their exploitation by Northern European capital seriously
inhibits the economic development of their homelands as they are
drawn from the fittest sections of the working population. Because
they are young, fit, predominantly single, they also take out much
less in social benefits than does the indigenous working population
in their country of adoption. They tend to work for lower wages and
fill the jobs which the native workers do not want. To a considerable
extent Europe&rsquo;s tremendous post war prosperity has been built
upon the backs of the migrants.</P>
<P>But &lsquo;Europe&rsquo; has not shown its gratitude. The
governments of all the EEC countries have responded to their
inability to provide a decent standard of living for workers &ndash;
houses, schools, hospitals and job security &ndash; by blaming the
influx of immigrants. All have imposed immigration controls in stages
over the past ten years. In Britain, the Commonwealth Immigration
Acts of 1962 and 1968 and the 1971 Immigration Act, have virtually
closed the door to black immigrants. In July 1974 France imposed a
total ban on new entrants unless a specific job was arranged and
accommodation guaranteed. Germany too has imposed rigid quotas and is
currently drafting legislation to limit further entry. Belgium and
Holland have also tightened their policies. The most recent moves in
the direction of restriction are closely related to the economic
recession which has hit Europe in the past two years and go far
beyond the limiting of new entrants. Depriving existing immigrants of
their jobs and repatriation has become respectable currency. A
representative of the German Employers&rsquo; Federation has said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;In the case of a decline of the employment
situation ... the foreigner would have to expect to be the first to
lose his job.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The government has ordered firms to discriminate against foreign
workers. Germans were to be given first preference for jobs.
Employers should make foreign workers redundant -even offering
redundancy pay &ndash; whereupon the authorities would withdraw work
and residence permits and expel them. To make life even more
difficult areas are to be designated where no more immigrants are to
be permitted to live, urban areas to impose a limit of 12 per cent
foreigners within their boundaries and cuts to be made in child
allowances.</P>
<P>In October 1974 a referendum was held in Switzerland, staged
managed by the Neo-fascist National Action Party, which aimed at
cutting the number of immigrants in residence by half. Over 30 per
cent voted in favour. A right wing politician, Swarzenbach is
building on this &lsquo;success&rsquo; by demanding the apparently
more modest demand of a 2&frac12; per cent cut in the immigrant
numbers.</P>
<P>At the same time a much harsher policy has developed towards
dependents. The British immigration authorities are developing savage
attitudes towards the wives and children of Pakistani and Indian
immigrants. The last Labour government insisted on a &lsquo;special
entry certificate&rsquo; for each wife, husband or child who wanted
to join a worker in Britain. A vast bureaucracy of &lsquo;entry
certificate officers&rsquo; was established in the High Commissions
of the &lsquo;country of origin&rsquo; &ndash; chiefly Pakistan,
India, Bangladesh and East Africa.</P>
<P>These officers investigate the claims of workers&rsquo;
dependents. They assume that the prospective immigrants are not the
wives, husbands or children of workers in Britain. So the applicants
are cross-examined. If the stories differ in one small detail from
the stories of the workers they seek to join, their applications are
refused. Also hopeful immigrants are made to wait months and even
years for information. <B>The Times</B> reported in November 1974:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;A newly married woman was told she would have to
wait till mid 1976 before she could even get an interview for her
entry certificate application.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The Swiss, German and Dutch authorities have a deliberate policy
of rotation of work permits to deter foreign workers from bringing
their wives and families. The Dutch government is quite explicit:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;... our country has a need for foreign labour and
it does not have a need for families from abroad.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">So the law is being tightened up in every country. New immigrants
are increasingly finding the obtaining of entry difficult and many
existing ones are living precariously. However wholesale repatriation
is not really on the agenda. Migrants <I>are</I> central to the
economy of Western Europe and will remain so. Those who do stay are
going to find life becoming tougher and tougher as the <I>threat</I>
of repatriation is used. Immigrants have always done the dirtiest and
lowest paid jobs. The building trade, transitory, poorly paid,
dangerous and disorganised claims a very high proportion of
immigrants in all countries. (In France 35 per cent male migrants are
building workers, in Switzerland 33.7 per cent, Germany 21 per cent
and Britain 30 per cent). Transport, foundry work, clothing
manufacture, hotels and catering also have very high incidences of
immigrant workers and in some cases they provide the overwhelming
majority of workers. Promotion is extremely rare; employers always
using the excuse that indigenous workers would not stand for it.
Actually of course it suits the employers much better to avoid any
movement to integration, to have a permanent rootless and weak
stratum in the workplaces.</P>
<P>There is a depressing uniformity about the living accommodation
made available to immigrants. &lsquo;Even where no direct law forbids
occupation to foreigners, very little public housing is available.
Local authorities discriminate in compiling their housing lists. A
more common form of accommodation is that provided by companies. It
is usually of the hostel variety and available only to single workers
&ndash; a further disincentive to bringing dependents. Minimum
provisions are laid down in Germany:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;every occupant of such accommodation shall be
provided with a minimum of a straw palliasse and a pillow. Woollen
blankets, and bed linen ... shall be changed once a month; The straw
must be replaced as required but at least every three months.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Hot water need only be provided if the work carried out by the
tenants is classified as dirty. Clearly the worker could be forgiven
for thinking he was entering prison! The impression might be
confirmed in some cases by the rules and regulations imposed which
include clearing the hostel after 5 a.m. every day, being in bed with
lights out by 10 p.m., and the forbidding of visitors. One survey
showed that wardens were often former concentration camp employees;
whilst Algerian workers in France often find themselves supervised by
expelled colons!</P>
<P>However, workers in this sort of accommodation can count
themselves fortunate compared with the plight of those forced to seek
accommodation in the private sector. In their book, <B>Immigrant
Workers and the Class Structure in Western Europe</B>, Castles and
Kosack report:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;In an old chocolate factory owned by a private
speculator at Ivry (a suburb of Paris) 541 black Africans were
sharing 11 rooms in 1969. Some of the dormitories including one in
which 70 people were sleeping had no windows. The ground floor
boasted two taps with drinking water, the other floors two taps with
more drinking water. There were five WCs and one wash basin.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Even worse conditions prevail in the shanty towns or <I>bidonvilles</I>
on the outskirts of French industrial towns. It is estimated that
some 100,000 people (largely immigrants) live in the <I>bidonvilles</I>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The <I>bidonville</I> looks like a rubbish dump.
The inhabitants pile any materials around their walls and on their
roofs in a vain attempt to keep out the wet and cold and to protect
the roofs from being carried away by a strong wind. There are no
sanitary amenities of any kind. The open sewers are a constant danger
to health.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Housing is the most dramatic illustration of the grim place
occupied by immigrants in Western Europe. However it is also the case
that immigrants are disadvantaged in every other area. They suffer
more accidents at work, greater incidences of diseases like TB, wait
longer for hospital treatment and have poorer facilities for their
own education and their children&rsquo;s.</P>
<P>At the same time as the governments are tightening up the law on
legal immigrants, the traffic in illegal immigrants is intensifying.
It is estimated that there are over one million permanent illegal
immigrants in Europe and that possibly as many as 250,000 are brought
in each year. This is a very big business indeed. The operators have
vast sums in capital tied up in it and they operate like 18th century
slavers. Villages in Mali and Senegal are used as pools of indentured
labour. Young men and women are provided with passports, travel
documents and work permits, flown into private airfields, or carried
in crates in container trucks, housed in primitive barracks and
provided with jobs. The catch is that they are tied financially to
the operator for years. They can be paid any wages he thinks fit,
given any available accommodation and charged any rent and, since
they are illegal and subject to immediate deportation, they dare not
protest. Recently a German employer denounced his 17 Moroccan workers
to the police as illegal immigrants. It was then discovered that he
had not paid them for a whole year. He denounced them to the police
when they raised the question of wages!</P>
<P>The level of organisation and the smooth running of operations &ndash;
which for example can bring hundreds of busloads of Turks into
Germany, disguised as tourists from Ankara and deliver them to their
employers &ndash; speak of a sophisticated international network. It
is interesting that no big operator has yet been brought to book.
Instead the authorities concentrate on waging brutal manhunts of the
helpless victims. In Britain the Home Office employs a massive force
of policemen around the coast lines of South East England to chase
pathetic half starved Pakistanis. The authorities are well aware that
the division between legal and so-called illegal is one to exploit in
their policy of intimidation. Unfortunately some immigrants
themselves are frightened into accepting the division themselves.</P>

<p class="fst">West European trade unions have a pretty poor record where these
matters are concerned. Many have a verbal commitment to recruitment
and defence of foreign workers at a national level, but the record in
specific situations ranges from the passive to the reactionary. They
show little interest in organising immigrants. Exceptions are in
industries which have long traditions of closed shops and
unionisation. All have passively accepted the recent legislative
moves against immigrants, and in the case of the major Swiss Unions
actively campaigned for restrictive legislation.</P>
<P>And when in January, Roy Jenkins, the Home Secretary, relaxed the
Immigration Act in order to allow the entry of Fillipino girls
(wanted by his rich friends as domestic servants) the TUC registered
a strong protest This is the other side of the coin of &lsquo;Buy
British&rsquo;, an economic nationalism which can only divide and
weaken the working class at a time when maximum unity is essential.</P>
<P>The unions do not in general appoint officials with special
knowledge of the language or culture of the immigrant groups. Many
actively argue that no special provisions are required and even that
special provisions are themselves discriminatory. When immigrants do
fight back against their dreadful conditions they have learnt to
expect no help from their union and in some cases even active
opposition. The recent actions at Mansfield Hosiery, Imperial
Typewriters and Kenilworth Products and earlier at Courtaulds,
Preston, and Birmid, Smethwick, in Britain provide examples of unions
who quite callously sold out black workers. And such examples abound
in Europe too.</P>
<P>The position of the migratory workers and the attitudes of the
trade unions places the whole future of the working class in
jeopardy. In the absence of principled propaganda campaigns and
determined workshop struggles for unity, the stage is surrendered to
the extreme right always ready to exploit racialist sentiments in the
working class. In each of the European countries the neo-fascists
have gained strength recently. The Order Nouveau (French fascists)
worked very closely with the French Mafia in summer 1973, when they
organised a campaign of brutal violence against the North African
workers of Marseilles. A local Marseilles newspaper showed how
strongly was fascist influence when they published an editorial which
would have done credit to Goebbels:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;We have had enough of Algerian troublemakers,
syphilitics and pimps, madmen, thieves, and killers who take
advantage of uncontrolled immigration.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The same organisation in 1974 organised a national petition
calling for an end to all immigration. In Germany the NPD has been
very prominent in attacking the alleged depravity of Turks and Slavs.
In Britain the outpourings of Enoch Powell in the mid-sixties pushed
the government, the opposition and the press to the right on the
immigration issue. There has been a sharp increase in violence
against the foreigner in every country and as the recession deepens
we can expect racialist hysteria to increase. The employers, the
governments and the extreme right have got ready-made targets and the
unions will bear a heavy responsibility for allowing this situation
to develop.</P>
<P>But it is not all gloom. For, recently, immigrants in all
countries have begun to fight back &ndash; and with some success. The
responsibilities of the revolutionary left in all countries is clear.
It must involve itself in all such struggles helping and encouraging
immigrant workers to combat their own oppression. In Britain, black
workers are becoming increasingly responsive to revolutionary
politics. It is here that the great hope lies.</p>
