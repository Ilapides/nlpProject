<p class="fst">Deskilling, narrowing pay differentials, increasing supervision
and loss of autonomy, longer working hours, pressure on breaks and
greater stress have been the hallmarks of every big transformation of
the labour process since capitalism began. Handicraft workers in the
domestic system were subjected to the fierce discipline of time in
the early stages of the industrial revolution. Craftsmen in metal and
most other mediums were deskilled by technical innovations throughout
the 19th century and have continued to have their skills assaulted in
the 20th. The privileged male commercial clerk was replaced by
cheaper female labour, typewriters and adding machines. In the late
20th century computerised techniques have relentlessly undermined a
whole range of skilled work in many different fields.</p>

<p>Whilst such processes have been a continuous feature of the growth
of capitalism they have been intensified in periods of recession.
Faced with a sharp decline in their ability to maintain profit
levels, employers have tried to introduce organisational and
technical innovation whilst reining in wage increases. Handicraft
workers suffered massively in the first big depression in the late
1830s. Many skilled craftsmen had their conditions eroded in the
great depression which commenced in 1873. The depression of the
interwar years was a period of much experimentation in what was
called &#8216;scientific management&#8217;. Mass unemployment experienced by
workers in slumps has been a vital weapon in the bosses&#8217; armoury.</p>

<p>The current recession has been no exception to this rule. Many
groups of workers have been subjected to additional stresses,
attempted cuts in real wages and displacement by new technologies and
changed working practices in addition to becoming victims of
overproduction. Relatively little attention, however, has been given
to the manner in which changes in the labour process have struck at
the professions, many of them occupying management or quasi
management roles. They have been cushioned by higher living standards
and generally better job security. They would hardly merit
sympathetic responses from a working class somewhat shell shocked
after more than a decade of attacks!</p>

<p>However, in the current decline and decomposition of capitalism,
in a desperate attempt to hang on to profit rates, the system is even
attacking elements which have helped to form the cement holding
together gross inequalities. At different rates of implementation
medicine, law, education and social work are all sampling practices
previously experienced largely by industrial and low paid clerical workers.</p>

<p>In the new hospital trusts accountants and administrators are
wrenching autonomy away from doctors. The campaign to reduce junior
doctors&#8217; hours is largely a thinly disguised pay cut. Reduced hours
are a sick joke anyway since increased paperwork means work is
constantly taken home. A further twist is programmes to commit the
life work of highly skilled specialists to computer memory. This
should be a rational contribution to accessible medical knowledge. In
the present market-oriented service it is likely to be used to
deskill medical personnel and cut costs. In the health market
managers are the new elite, their salaries and status having passed
that of all but a small number of specialists. Absurdly, highly
trained specialists now seek non-medical management posts in pursuit
of money and status.</p>

<p>Implausibly, perhaps, similar things are happening to lawyers. The
change of rule on legal aid, for example, is destroying small legal
practices and producing the greatest rash of mergers ever. Giant
practices are emerging in all the big cities, staffed by young
salaried lawyers working very long hours with no hope of following
the traditional route to partnership. And they are run by
professional managers and accountants.</p>

<p>University lecturers are seeing their privileged existence
slipping through their fingers. Appointed on short term contracts,
their salaries are repeatedly pegged by administrators&#8217; cries of
institutional poverty. They are subjected to larger classes and more
of them and are driven to produce distance learning packs and
computer aided teaching devices. The working day is extended and in
the rush to semester programmes so is the working year. Like hospital
doctors and many lawyers the only avenue to higher earnings is &#8211; to
become a manager.</p>

<p>At the hardest end of the profession are school teachers. The
features which are still only tendencies for most teachers in higher
education are already in place in the schools. Especially significant
is the massively increased level of supervision engendered by the
following of national curriculum programmes. A young teacher in a
first job can now expect to have to work on preparation and
administration till past midnight five days a week. This represents a
20 percent increase in the working day in the past decade without any
salary recompense.</p>

<p>Social workers too are bowing beneath the strain of increased
workloads brought on by the &#8216;care in the community&#8217; initiative
which aims to turn them into the system&#8217;s &#8216;gatekeepers&#8217;. In
certain areas (psychiatric and children) a social worker can expect
to have to complete no less than 11 forms for each client.
Supervision has rapidly intensified and the individual worker has had
almost every area of personal initiative and choice taken away in the
pursuit, by management, of bureaucratic routinisation.</p>

<p>It must be stressed that, although it is possible to discern a
pattern in these attacks, their impact is different in different
situations, and so are possible outcomes. At a general level it can
be argued that, by attacking pay, conditions and status, the ruling
class may be sacrificing one of its crucial bulwarks in a politically
and socially reliable professional strata. Historically, shifts in
the labour process have tended to produce resistance and
organisation. Chartism attended the wrecking of the handicraft
industry and its replacement by factories. New Unionism came out of
the organisational and technological shake up of the late 19th
century depression. White collar unionism grew partly as a response
to the development of large enterprises in the depression of the
interwar years.</p>

<p>The professions have a considerable legacy of privileged status.
It is already undermined in the case of teachers and social workers
who moved to unionisation decades ago. Differential conditions among
doctors and lawyers, for example, could be enough to muffle anger and
stifle militant tendencies. We might not want to argue that doctors
are part of the working class. Nevertheless, something significant is
happening among professional workers in late capitalism. Whilst it
might not be the centrepiece of concern for revolutionary socialists
it does demand our attention.</p>
