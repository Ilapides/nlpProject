<p class="fst"><strong>MURIEL BROWNING, Marxist, trade unionist and Labour Party
member for almost half a century, died peacefully at home in Llanelli
on 14 July after a relatively short illness.</strong></p>

<p>For a Marxist, the struggle against the Tories and their decaying
capitalist system comes almost as second nature. The battle against
Labour&#8217;s right-wing witch-hunters we take in our stride.</p>

<p>But to write an obituary about a comrade who was respected in the
labour movement, inspired all those fortunate enough to have met her
and was loved by many is an extremely daunting task.</p>

<p>Muriel&#8217;s record in the labour movement in Wales stands second to
none. A tireless fighter for the rights of the working people, she
was a TGWU shop steward in Morris Motors (later BL) for over 20 years.</p>

<p>She was a delegate to national and regional committees of the
union, Swansea Trades Council and Llanelli Labour Party general
management committee (GMC) where she held most positions, including
President when Denzil Davies MP was selected as candidate for the constituency.</p>

<p>However it was her contribution in the Labour women&#8217;s movement,
in which Muriel stood out as an uncompromising defender of Marxism,
which impressed supporters and drew the begrudging respect of opponents.</p>

<p>Many local campaigns were instigated by Llanelli Women&#8217;s
Council, of which she was the secretary for many years. During the
miners&#8217; strike it came as no surprise to see Muriel elected chair
of the Cynheidre Miners&#8217; Support Group. She raised thousands of
pounds and was always prominent on the picket lines at 5 o&#8217;clock on
those freezing mornings.</p>

<p>Despite her impressive record in the movement, steps were being
taken by Llanelli&#8217;s right-wing witch-hunters to expel Muriel
because of her links with <strong>Militant</strong>.</p>

<p>Some, with just a couple of years&#8217; membership, were claiming
that Muriel was trying to infilitrate the party &#8211; after 40 years&#8217; membership!</p>

<p>Right-wing careerists who use the movement for personal
advancement will never understand the power of the Marxist ideas
which inspire comrades like Muriel.</p>

<p>In her sixties she could still be seen every Saturday morning in
Llanelli town centre selling <strong>Militant</strong>. She participated
regularly on estate sales and was the first to encourage younger
comrades to go with her on an early-morning factory sale.</p>

<p>Even though Muriel spent the last 18 months of her life fighting
her expulsion threat, she had the satisfaction of knowing that those
who really counted had not forgotten the role she had played in the movement.</p>

<p>It was significant that workers who had been in struggle defended
Muriel. On the Llanelli GMC, NUM, NUR and TGWU delegates were the
most vociferous in their opposition to the attacks on her.</p>

<p>If she had been able to see it through to the end, Muriel was
confident that the witch-hunt would have been defeated. She remarked
at the time: &#8220;I&#8217;m certainly not demoralised. It makes me want to
fight all the more. This witch-hunt has strengthened my belief in
Marxist ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a number of her opponents and even some <strong>Militant</strong>
supporters have experienced, a tongue-lashing from Muriel was the
verbal equivalent of a machine-gun assault. Class compromise was
dealt with particularly sharply. Sloppiness, cynicism and pessimism
had no part in Muriel&#8217;s vocabulary.</p>

<p>This hard exterior hid an extremely soft and caring centre.
Comrades visiting Muriel&#8217;s home never went away hungry, although
sometimes they came out drunk after a few glasses of her home-made
wine. She literally brought up some of the best Marxists in the South
Wales and British labour movement, organised, educated, fed and
clothed them.</p>

<p>For the thousands of <strong>Militant</strong> supporters at the South Wales
Summer Camp, Muriel was as much a permanent feature as Ted Grant. She
was always responsible for the catering and comrades remember camps
not always for the success of the speakers but more often by the
strength of Muriel&#8217;s curries.</p>

<p>She was the first to acknowledge that much of what she achieved
would have been impossible without the support of her family. Harry,
her husband, an active trade unionist in his own right, was an
invaluable ally along with the patience and understanding of her
daughters Cheryl and Dianne.</p>

<p>The life of a working-class women under capitalism is difficult
enough. For a wife, mother and grandmother to play any kind of role
in the labour movement would have been impossible without their support.</p>

<p>Muriel was fortunate that even after Harry was taken ill, she had
a family who understood her loyalty not only to her own family but
also to her class.</p>

<p>We send our condolences to Harry, Cheryl, Dianne and Muriel&#8217;s
grand-children and family. We thank them for allowing us a share in
her life.</p>

<p>When answering her right-wing critics 18 months ago, Muriel said:
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in the Labour Party when these witch-hunters are long
forgotten&#8221;. Those political minnows are already forgotten, whereas
Muriel Browning&#8217;s chapter in working-class history is guaranteed.</p>

<p>We salute the passing of an outstanding Marxist. Farewell
Muriel-comrade, friend and class fighter. Forward to socialism!</p>
