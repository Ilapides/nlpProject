<p class="fst">The arrival of <strong>Militant</strong> made a great difference for
Marxists in the Labour Party and unions. It gave us a regular paper,
something to work from, to explain ideas in discussions, and to
understand ourselves what was happening in Britain and internationally.</p>

<p>Some people may not appreciate how difficult it is to act as a
Marxist without a regular paper. Before <strong>Militant</strong> there was
<strong>Socialist Fight</strong> &#8211; which when I first came across it was
duplicated and produced very intermittently.</p>

<p><strong>Militant</strong> was well received by activists &#8211; I used to sell
about six each month at my work, British Motor Company. But for big
sales we had to rely on occasional mass public meetings.</p>

<p>In the Labour Party many people patronised us. I used to sell one
or two, but the ideas were dismissed as &#8220;utopian&#8221;. I was told
that &#8220;revolutionary ideas may be alright for Europeans, but it was
not for Britain&#8221;. The Welsh Labour Party was then totally dominated
by the right wing; councillors, MPs, party organisation. There was a
left-wing rump &#8211; not Marxist though; often they were teachers, who
left once they got their headships.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t really compare the paper nowadays with then. At that
time the paper had to give all its space over to analysis and
explanation &#8211; almost every article seemed to end in the same way,
with the demand for the nationalisation of (the then) 350 monopolies
&#8211; it had to.</p>

<p>I think the paper has really come of age during the miners&#8217;
strike. It&#8217;s got lots of fresh news and articles by workers, it was
always a paper for workers &#8211; but I think it&#8217;s become a real
workers&#8217; paper now.</p>
