<p class="fst">AT THE Welsh Region Women&#8217;s Conference on November 9, <strong>Militant</strong>
supporter Muriel Browning was re-elected onto the Regional Committee.
Conference adopted a Marxist resolution from Llanelli Women&#8217;s
Council, congratulating Liverpool City Council on their stand against
Tory cuts.</p>

<p>A miners&#8217; wife invited to speak had a tremendous response when
she said that after the strike she intended joining the Labour Party.
This is also the intention of the majority of women in the
Penrhwcyber support group. A resolution supporting the miners was
carried overwhelmingly.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Influence</h4>

<p class="fst">A resolution was carried which included: &#8220;As a step towards
increasing women&#8217;s influence in the Party, conference demands the
right to elect the Women&#8217;s Division of the National Executive
Committee.&#8221; Decisions arrived at by the outgoing Regional Committee
were put to conference and overwhelmingly accepted. These included:
one of the women&#8217;s seats on the NEC should be elected at National
Conference; the four women&#8217;s seats on the Labour Party Wales
Executive should be elected at the Welsh Women&#8217;s conference.</p>

<p>The acceptance of this change will give more authority to the
Women&#8217;s conference and marks a real step forward.</p>
