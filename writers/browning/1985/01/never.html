<p class="fst">WHILST COUNTING out tea bags for the food parcels, Isobel Knight,
wife of a striking miner in Cynheidre pit, described some of the
effects of the strike:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is now getting hard, the worst part is trying to
keep my family warm &#8211; we have only had one lot of coal since the
strike started. So every Saturday we spend most of the day scavenging
for wood. There isn&#8217;t one dead tree left in our area, we&#8217;ve had
the lot.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The struggle has brought our family very close
together. The kids understand the need to economise in everything.
They don&#8217;t refuse to help with the scavenging and the older boys
are always ready to help their father doing support work.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Christmas is not the same this year, but I managed to
save 50p a week for a turkey and presents for the younger children.
Dick (her husband, a winder) has said &#8216;no way will I wind for
scabs&#8217;. I fully support him, we will never give in now to the scabs
or the Coal Board.&#8221;</p>
