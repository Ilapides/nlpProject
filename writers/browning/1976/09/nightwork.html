<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;321, 10 September 1976, p.&nbsp;11.<br />
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<br />
<p class="fst">In her article on night shifts for women [<strong>Militant</strong>,
No.&nbsp;318] Chris Nicholls says she wants to &#8220;fight for better
conditions and amenities for all women workers.&#8221; I could not agree
with her more. This is why as a shop steward in the TGWU I oppose
nightshift working for women!</p>

<p>There is mention in the article of the hazards of night shift
working and the ruinous effects it has on health. According to
medical reports a women&#8217;s whole body cycle changes [also the same
for men incidentally]. We all know what happens when you try and
change machinery: there are inevitable break downs. The same thing
happens to the delicate machinery of our bodies.</p>

<p>Lack of sleep, consumption and loss of appetite, to name just a
few, can lead to a complete breakdowns resulting in a couple of days
or a week or two on the sick. Chris Nicholls would be a very
fortunate woman if she has worked permanent night work for three
years without it affecting her health at all.</p>

<p>I believe that it is a fallacy for women to believe that when they
work night shift they are also able to be with their children during
the day. The only way this is possible if the mother is severely
deprived of sleep during the day. What use is a tired irritable
mother to her children! This would certainly not be to the children&#8217;s
benefit. Not to mention the increased burden placed on the father who
would also have to do his 8 hour stint.</p>

<p>The Sex Discrimination Act has helped to create another fallacy:&#8211;
women should have the &#8220;freedom of choice&#8221;. The trade union
leadership, whilst paying lip service to opposing night shift working
for women, have made no serious attempt to prevent employers using
the loop holes in the new legislation.</p>

<p>It is left to each plant in each industry to conduct their own
fight against the introduction of night shift [... misprint ...]
Equal Pay Act it is only where there is a strong union organisation
can the women combat their further exploitation by the bosses.</p>

<p>A classic example of this was at the Ford plant in Dagenham. The
women, supported by the men, who led the fight for equal pay have
also resisted all attempts by the company to foist night working on
the women in exchange for equal pay.</p>

<p>There was no choice for Chris Nicholls either. She could only work
night shift.</p>

<p>I must agree that night shifts are necessary to the industrial
economy of this country. Under a capitalist economy it is essential
that the employers utilise plant and machinery to its maximum
capacity. These machines need operators who are also used to their
maximum capacity. This includes excessive overtime and night shift working.</p>

<p>Under the present system the working class have no &#8220;rights to
work the hours we choose or earn the kind of money we want to earn.&#8221;
Whilst we realise this and have sympathy with the women who are
forced to do it we cannot condone neither can we accept a worker
trying to justify night shift working.</p>
