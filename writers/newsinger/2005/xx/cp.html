<strong>Class or Nation: Communists, Imperialism and Two World Wars</strong><br/>
<em>Tauris Academic Studies, 2005, &#163;47.50</em></p>

<p class="fst">Academic discussion of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB)
has in recent years been dominated by attempts to minimise the
organisation&#8217;s subordination to Moscow. From this point of view the
party&#8217;s twists and turns derive not from Stalin&#8217;s changing
priorities, but from the demands of the class struggle at home.</p>

<p>Even the Third Period of ultra-left sectarianism has been
explained and defended as a response to the exigencies of the
struggle in Britain. Moscow&#8217;s instructions were, we are seriously
expected to believe, of no great moment because the CPGB was in the
process of developing the strategy and tactics of the Third Period of
its own volition. And, amazingly, so was every other Communist Party
throughout the world. This is so much nonsense. Moreover, CP members
from the late 1920s through to the end of the 1950s would never have
recognised themselves in the accounts provided by these &#8216;Moscow-lite&#8217;
historians. Moscow was the centre of their universe and they were
proud to be Stalinists.</p>

<p>Indeed the very idea that they decided the party&#8217;s political
direction themselves would have been regarded as a dangerous heresy.
The fact that even <strong>The British Road To Socialism</strong> had to be cleared
with Stalin personally is a bit of a clue here. Even the party&#8217;s
reluctant repudiation of the man in 1956, it is worth remembering,
only took place because of orders from Moscow!</p>

<p>While Moscow-lite is a very inferior brew, it can still cloud the
senses and affect one&#8217;s judgement. Neil Redfern&#8217;s new book on the
CP and British imperialism is a good example of this.</p>

<p>Redfern sets out to explain why the CP &#8216;enthusiastically
supported the British war effort in the Second World War, given that
most of its leaders had been militant opponents of the First World
War&#8217;. He acknowledges the influence of the Soviet Union on the
CPGB, but really only in passing, arguing that what was decisive was
the way that Russian interests &#8216;dovetailed neatly with the
ideological baggage&#8217; that the party had &#8216;inherited from the
Second International&#8217;. Whereas the party still had a &#8216;revolutionary
orientation&#8217; in 1935, by 1945 it had embraced &#8216;a new reformist
strategy&#8217; and &#8216;completed the transition from Bolshevism to Second
International Marxism&#8217;. Socialism, for the CP, would now &#8216;grow
organically out of mature capitalism rather than be the fruit of revolution&#8217;.</p>

<p>How is this reversion to &#8216;Menshevism&#8217; (Redfern&#8217;s word)
explained? Although his argument is not entirely clear, he seems to
regard the hold of reformism and social imperialism over the labour
movement as a product of the super-profits accruing from imperialism.
This explains why the left was at best half-hearted in its opposition
to imperialism and at worst supported it. It was this that created
the material circumstances whereby the CP was relentlessly pulled
away from the revolutionary politics of the 1920s back towards
reformism and social imperialism.</p>

<p>Presumably the process was inevitable and it is difficult to see
what role Redfern can conceive for revolutionaries in imperialist
countries other than supporting national liberation struggles
elsewhere. Anything else is Eurocentrist and indeed we are told that
Trotskyism &#8216;was even more Eurocentrist than Stalinism&#8217;.</p>
<p>Leaving this aside, the main trouble is that, while he has much to
say regarding the CP that is of interest (his discussion of the
party&#8217;s response to the 1943 Tehran Conference is particularly
impressive), his explanatory framework just does not work. There is
too much it cannot explain and this leads him into contradiction,
caricature and distortion. On the one hand, for example, the CP is
condemned for giving its colonial work a low priority, but then when
the CPer Ben Bradley was imprisoned in India in 1929, his motives are
put down, at least in part, to paternalism. Evidence is ruthlessly
bent into a shape that supports Redfern&#8217;s argument. This is not
good enough.</p>

<p>Redfern seems unaware that the very question he tells us he
intends to answer actually contradicts his central theses. He is
primarily concerned to explain why the men who led the CP had opposed
the First World War, but supported the Second. The fact is, of
course, that his argument cannot explain how it was that these men
(and women) came to oppose the First World War in the first place;
indeed according to his thesis surely they can&#8217;t have opposed it
because of the strength of reformism and social imperialism at the
time. The difficulty derives from a general misunderstanding of
reformism and its material basis that it is not possible to develop
here. Let us instead look more particularly at his discussion of Stalinism.</p>

<p>Redfern emphasises that the CP was not a mindless puppet with its
strings pulled by Moscow. This is his caricature of the Trotskyist
critique. Instead he compares the Comintern to an orchestra with the
various musicians willingly following the direction of the conductor.
Leaving aside that it was not music that the Comintern made, this
seems much closer to the Trotskyist critique than his earlier
caricature. However, he goes on to give it a Moscow-lite spin. The
CP, we are told, developed &#8216;primarily by its own internal dynamic&#8217;
and party members &#8216;were loyal to Moscow because they wished to be&#8217;.
This misses the point. Subordination is still subordination, even if
voluntary, and of course, the working out of this subordination was
central to the party&#8217;s internal dynamic.</p>

<p>The importance of loyalty to the Soviet Union is clearly
demonstrated when we look at the CP during the Second World War. It
did not rally to the empire when war broke out in September 1939.
Why? Because the Soviet Union was allied with Nazi Germany. It did
rally to the empire in June 1941. Why? Because Nazi Germany had
attacked the Soviet Union. Loyalty to the Soviet Union was decisive,
not the party&#8217;s reformism or social imperialism.</p>

<p>Similarly with the post-war period, even though the CP
wholeheartedly embraced reformism, the Cold War saw it subordinate
that strategy to the defence of the Soviet Union. How does Redfern
explain this? The best he can come up with is that defence of the
Soviet Union &#8216;was a specific and extreme manifestation of
Eurocentrist tendencies&#8217;. This is stretching his argument to and
beyond breaking point.</p>

<p>To sum up, there is much of interest in this book and it is
written very much from the left unlike other Moscow-lite histories.
Its failure to make an explanation of Stalinism central to its
argument, however, leads it seriously astray.</p>
