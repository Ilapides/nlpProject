<strong>The Last English Revolutionary: Tom Wintringham 1898&#8211;1949</strong><br/>
<em>Sutton, 2000, &#163;20</em></p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;You probably have not heard of Tom Wintringham,&#8217; writes Hugh
Purcell, &#8216;but by the time you have finished this book I hope you
will agree that you should have.&#8217; And he is absolutely right.
Wintringham is one of those people who was well known when he was
alive, but subsequently disappeared from view. His falling out with
the Communist Party (CP) in 1938 meant that he was effectively
airbrushed out of their history and his refusal to embrace the Labour
Party until just before his death excluded him from theirs.</p>

<p>Instead, according to Purcell, he stands alone, as someone who
attempted &#8216;to explore a distinctively English way to revolution&#8217;.
This is, however, not the case. What Wintringharn really stood for at
the height of his influence was a popular front politics that never
really took off in Britain. This is the real reason for his neglect.
Nevertheless, Purcell does make a very good case for a sympathetic
re-examination of the man and his politics.</p>

<p>Wintringham was born in Grimsby in 1898, the son of one of the
town&#8217;s most prominent families. He was educated at private schools
before joining the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War.
Here he broke decisively with his family background by serving in the
ranks as an air mechanic. After the war, he went to Oxford
University, but as someone who had moved dramatically to the left. He
visited Soviet Russia in 1920 where he worked as a translator,
meeting John Reed among others. As Purcell notes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Moscow 1920 remained in Tom&#8217;s mind as the practical
affirmation of his faith in socialism. This was not the Moscow of the
1930s with its paranoia, purges and misery. The mood was youthful,
idealistic and free. It was still the revolution of the Soviets
rather than the dictatorship of the Communist Party.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Wintringham returned from Russia a committed revolutionary
socialist and in 1923 he joined the Communist Party. Within the
party, Wintringham was associated with Harry Pollitt and Rajani Palme
Dutt in their efforts to &#8216;bolshevise&#8217; the party, to turn it from
a propagandist into a fighting organisation. He was appointed
assistant editor to the party newspaper, the <strong>Workers&#8217; Weekly</strong>,
and was considered dangerous enough by the authorities to be one of
the 12 party leaders imprisoned in the run-up to Britain&#8217;s 1926
General Strike. Wintringham served six months and was only released
weeks before the battle began. He was responsible for the covert
publication of the party&#8217;s <strong>Workers&#8217; Bulletin</strong>, the mere
possession of which could earn a prison sentence.</p>

<p>Purcell begins to have difficulties with Wintringham&#8217;s
transformation into a Stalinist apparatchik in the aftermath of the
General Strike. He went along with the Communist International&#8217;s
Third Period turn and its ultra-left sectarianism without a word of
complaint. Purcell suggests that he kept his head down during this
period, but this is not really credible. One feature of the Third
Period was precisely that party members could not keep their heads
down, particularly if they had Wintringham&#8217;s class background.
Moreover, Purcell acknowledges that he &#8216;penned his share of &#8220;class
against class&#8221; agitprop&#8217;, attacking both the Labour Party and the
left wing Independent Labour Party as fascist organisations.</p>

<p>More important, he played a key role in launching the <strong>Daily
Worker</strong>, and only someone fully on board the Third Period madness
would have been in such a responsible position. Purcell, it has to be
said, never really gets his head around the way that men and women
like Wintringham, in many ways admirable, nevertheless willingly
subordinated themselves to the dictates of Moscow, no matter how
disastrous. He is not, of course, alone in this.</p>

<p>Wintringham clearly welcomed the Communist International&#8217;s 1935
popular front turn. The embrace of the broadest possible alliance
against fascism seemed to offer the CP a way into the political
mainstream. Wintringham was very much to the fore in this endeavour,
becoming the party&#8217;s military expert and commentator. He put his
money where his mouth was by going out to Spain to serve with the
International Brigades fighting against Franco in 1936.</p>

<p>As Purcell makes absolutely clear, Wintringham wholeheartedly
endorsed the Communist line in Spain, including the repression of the
revolutionary left, most notably the POUM. Indeed, he joined in the
slander of the POUM, whose leader, Nin, was tortured to death by the
Communist secret police. Nevertheless, it .was in Spain that he began
to fall out with the party.</p>

<p>Wintringham seems to have believed every lie that the CP told
about the POUM, every lie that they told about the victims of the
Great Terror in Russia, and every lie that they told about Trotsky
and the Trotskyists and their collaboration with the Gestapo. What he
refused to swallow was the denunciation of his American lover, Kitty
Bowler, as a Trotskyist. His refusal to break with her led to his
expulsion from the party in October 1938. In Russia, of course, such
a stance would have cost him his life, but Wintringham never grasped
this. His disagreement was with the British party and he never
uttered a word critical of Stalin. Purcell has difficulty with the
way that Wintringham&#8217;s experiences never actually led to him
denouncing the Moscow Trials or Stalin&#8217;s murderous regime. Indeed,
he was to remain an admirer of Stalin right up until his death in
1949. Purcell does not adequately get to grips with the remarkable
hold that Stalinism had on so much of the left, even outside of the
Communist Party.</p>

<p>Wintringham rationalised his break with the CP with the argument
that whereas he had wholeheartedly embraced the popular front as the
way forward, for the CP it was merely a tactical manoeuvre to be
cynically taken up and just as cynically put down. He argued that
Communist conduct in Spain demonstrated how skin deep the party&#8217;s
popular frontism really was. And, of course, the Hitler-Stalin Pact
of 1939 which led to the popular front being unceremoniously thrown
overboard bore this out.</p>

<p>Purcell is much too uncritical of the popular front politics that
Wintringham was to try to sustain throughout the Second World War.
Far from offering a way forward, they were to inevitably end up with
his joining the Labour Party after the war. To be fair, however,
there was some way to go before this result became clear.</p>
<p>A good case can be made that Wintringham actually achieved his
greatest influence during the Second World War. He was one of a
number of individuals (George Orwell, a great admirer of his at this
time, was another) who believed that Britain was approaching a
revolutionary situation in the summer of 1940.</p>

<p>Defeat had completely discredited the old order and growing
resentment at continuing inequalities and injustices in wartime was
fuelling widespread unrest. The organisation that Wintringham saw as
potentially decisive in any revolutionary outbreak was the Home
Guard. To a generation raised on <em>Dad&#8217;s Army</em> this seems
positively ludicrous, but at the time there were significant numbers
of people for whom the Home Guard was the arming of the workers and
for whom this was a guarantee against any compromise peace with
Hitler. Wintringham established a training school for the Home Guard
at Osterley Park and taught revolutionary guerrilla warfare to
thousands of volunteers, much to the alarm of the government. His <strong>New
Ways of Warfare</strong>, published in 1940, sold 75,000 copies in a
couple of months.</p>

<p>The revolution proved stillborn, however. If Britain had been
invaded or if a collaborationist government had taken power the Home
Guard might have become an important part of the British resistance,
but instead Churchill&#8217;s Conservative-Labour coalition government
successfully contained the unrest. The authorities took over Osterley
Park and Wintringham and his fellow thinkers were pushed aside.</p>

<p>He continued his campaign for &#8216;the imperialist war to be turned
into an antifascist war&#8217;, arguing the case in his book <strong>The
Politics of Victory</strong>, published in June 1941. This coincided with
Hitler&#8217;s invasion of Russia, which saw the CP turn from opposition
to the war to enthusiastic support for it. This support extended to
the Churchill coalition government and involved ferocious opposition
to the sort of regrouping on the left that people like Wintringham
were trying to bring about. He was one of the architects of
Commonwealth, a loosely organised movement that attempted to
challenge the coalition. For its pains Commonwealth was denounced by
the CP as &#8216;crypto-fascist&#8217;. Although it achieved some success at
wartime by-elections, Commonwealth was never to overcome its middle
class origins. If Labour had remained in a coalition with Churchill
in 1945, as the CP had urged, the movement might have achieved some
sort of breakthrough. As it was it never managed to go beyond
middle class radicalism.</p>

<p>In 1945, Wintringham published his bestselling attack on the
Tories, <strong>Your MP</strong>, which sold over 200,000 copies &#8211; but it
actually helped Labour into power. Only one Commonwealth MP was
elected and Wintringham subsequently joined the Labour Party. His
popular frontism led relentlessly to the embrace of reformism.
Wintringham was to die prematurely in 1949 and was, sad to say, soon
forgotten on the British left.</p>

<p>Clearly Wintringham is an interesting figure, someone who had a
considerable impact during his lifetime, but whose politics, in the
end, were found wanting. Purcell sees him, if he had lived, as a
future Eurocommunist, a contributor to <strong>Marxism Today</strong>. This
seems most unlikely: Wintringham was much too much a man of the left
to have ever been comfortable in that particular milieu. Much more
likely is that his failure to break intellectually with Stalinism
together with his continued popular frontism would have seen him
embrace some sort of Third Worldism. This would probably have been
irresistible in the aftermath of the Chinese Revolution of 1949.</p>

<p>Of course, this is all so much speculation. Whatever he might have
become, his life provides a useful case study of the impact of
Stalinism on one of the more independent thinkers on the left in the
period between the two world wars.</p>
