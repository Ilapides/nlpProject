<p class="fst">Mark Phythian<br/>
<strong>The Labour Party, War and International Relations 1945&#8211;2006</strong><br/>
<em>Routledge, 2007, &#163;19.99</em></p>

<p class="fst">One response to the Iraq war has been an attempt to blame it on
Tony Blair personally and to somehow exonerate the Labour Party. To
this end, the Labour Party&#8217;s past is mythologised, the Labour left
(despised and abused at the time) is treated as if it was the
authentic voice of the party, and previous Labour governments are
celebrated for their commitment to &#8220;internationalism&#8221;. In this
scenario, Blair performs as a sort of Pied Piper, leading the rats of
Hamelin or, on this occasion, the Parliamentary Labour Party from the
true path. There are a number of versions of this particular salvage
operation. The most recent is Mark Phythian&#8217;s <strong>The Labour Party,
War and International Relations 1945&#8211;2006</strong>. Here he makes a
heroic but, in the end, futile attempt to retrieve something from the
Labour tradition as far as foreign policy, international relations
and war are concerned.</p>

<p>At the start of his book, Phythian writes that the Labour Party&#8217;s
first serious consideration of &#8220;questions of war and peace&#8221; did
not take place until 1916&#8211;1917. The outcome was a <em>Statement of
War Aims</em> agreed at a special conference on 28 December 1917. In
the extract from the document that he quotes, the Labour Party made
it clear that it was only supporting the Allies in the First World
War so &#8220;that the world may henceforth be made safe for democracy&#8221;.
The most important of the party&#8217;s war aims was proclaimed as being
&#8220;that there shall be henceforth on earth no more war&#8221;. Among
other things, the statement also called for &#8220;the frank abandonment
of every form of imperialism&#8221; and &#8220;the entire abolition of
profit-making armament firms&#8221;.</p>

<p>The statement showed, Phythian argues, Labour&#8217;s &#8220;instinctive
pacifism&#8221;. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> He fails to mention the
section of the statement where the party endorsed the <em>Balfour
Declaration</em>, urging that Palestine should be &#8220;set free&#8221; and
that &#8220;such of the Jewish people as desire to do so may return and
may work out their own salvation, free from interference by those of
alien race and religion&#8221;. Whereas even the <em>Balfour Declaration</em>
had supposedly guaranteed &#8220;the civil and religious rights of the
existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine&#8221;, the Labour Party
statement did not even go this far in acknowledging the existence of
the Palestinians. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> It hardly needs
pointing out that since December 1917 the statement has remained a
dead letter: Labour governments have made war, crushed colonial
rebellions and embraced the arms industry, indeed today New Labour is
actually privatising parts of the British military. Their Zionist
commitment is the only part of the 1917 statement to which Labour has
remained true.</p>

<p>More important, however, is the fact that even at the very moment
that the Labour Party adopted this idealistic <em>Statement of War
Aims</em> it was participating in Lloyd George&#8217;s coalition
government that was engaged in waging the most bloody imperialist war
in history (at least up to that time). The Labour Party was part of
the coalition when James Connolly and the other Easter Rising
prisoners were executed in 1916. There is clearly a discrepancy
between the sentiments of the statement and the support for and
participation in the terrible slaughter that had already cost
millions of lives, left many more wounded and mutilated, and imposed
immense suffering on civilian populations in the combatant countries.</p>

<p>And, of course, Phythian also neglects the extent to which the
statement was a response to developments in Russia in the course of
1917. With the overthrow of the Tsar and the coming to power of the
Bolsheviks, the Labour leadership recognised that they confronted a
revolutionary rival for working class support. The statement was an
attempt to meet this challenge from the left by the proclamation of
various worthy sentiments that would placate the party&#8217;s rank and
file, while not compromising its actual support for the war. The gap
between Labour&#8217;s supposed instincts and its actual conduct in
government that was laid bare in 1917 has continued down to today.
How effectively does Phythian explain it?</p>

<p>He focuses on the period since 1945, identifying &#8220;certain values
and currents that have shaped the approaches the party has taken to
the question of war since 1945&#8221;. First there is &#8220;Labour&#8217;s
insistence on the primacy of the UN&#8221;, a principle that is required
to carry the main burden of his argument. There is also Labour&#8217;s
&#8220;distinctively restrictionist approach to military interventions&#8221;,
&#8220;Labour&#8217;s historic suspicion of power politics and secret
diplomacy&#8221;, &#8220;Labour&#8217;s tradition of anti-colonialism&#8221;,
&#8220;Labour&#8217;s internationalism&#8221; (although he does admit that this
is &#8220;an at times rather vague notion&#8221;), and, most remarkably, &#8220;a
deep-rooted suspicion of US motives in undertaking military
interventions&#8221;. Under Blair, he argues, these Labour values were
violated so that the Iraq war is very difficult &#8220;to reconcile ...
with the Labour Party tradition with regard to the questions of war&#8221;.
<a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> Phythian&#8217;s objection to the
unprovoked attack on Iraq seems to have more to do with the absence
of a UN resolution than with opposition to New Labour&#8217;s support for
US imperialism in the Middle East. More generally, however, his
rehearsal of Labour&#8217;s supposed &#8220;values and currents&#8221; tells us
nothing about Labour&#8217;s foreign policy since 1945. Indeed much of
Phythian&#8217;s own account exposes the gap between &#8220;values&#8221; and
actual conduct. Nevertheless, he clings to his idealist
interpretation with something like desperation.</p>

<p>What we shall do here is examine Labour&#8217;s foreign and war
policies, laying bare the real motives that have guided Labour
governments since 1945. It is these motives, the Labour leadership&#8217;s
understanding of the best interests of British imperialism, rather
than any supposed values or instincts that have determined Labour&#8217;s
conduct in power. How else can one seriously explain how a party with
an &#8220;instinctive pacifism&#8221;, according to Phythian, could take the
decision in January 1947 to develop a British atomic bomb! <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>At the risk of oversimplification, as far as the Labour Party was
concerned, the values and instincts were there for the consolation of
the party membership, while the business of government operated
according to a different agenda altogether. As a reformist party, the
Labour Party identified the British state, a capitalist state, as the
agency of reform and improvement. This identification, as far back as
the first Labour government in 1924, produced a determination to
protect the interests of the British state and this has, in turn,
produced a history of war and colonial repression.</p>

<p>More specifically, since 1945, far from Labour governments being
motivated by Phythian&#8217;s &#8220;values and currents&#8221;, they have been
motivated by the need to maintain Britain&#8217;s role as a junior
partner of American imperialism. Indeed, Labour embraced this role
earlier than the Conservatives, who still thought Britain strong
enough to go it alone as late as the Suez invasion of 1956, and
later, under Heath, briefly looked to Europe rather than to the
United States. The only time that Labour governments have equivocated
in their support for American imperialism has been moments when they
too looked to the European Union as an alternative. These moments
always passed and &#8220;America right or wrong&#8221; has remained the
Labour leadership&#8217;s watchword.</p>

<p>The discussion here will focus on three wars: Korea, Vietnam and Iraq.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Korea</h4>

<p class="fst">The Attlee government&#8217;s decision to send British troops to fight
in Korea in 1950 had one clear overriding motive: the need to sustain
Britain&#8217;s alliance with the United States. A failure to rally to
the American cause would inevitably have done serious damage to
relations between the two countries. In the circumstances the
despatch of troops was inevitable. The war was, of course, sanctioned
by the UN, but this was a mere fig leaf for America&#8217;s war. Labour&#8217;s
participation was determined not by any loyalty to the UN, but by the
need to show loyalty to the United States. This need derived from the
government&#8217;s awareness that post-1945 the British state no longer
had the power to protect British interests throughout the world. The
British were forced to turn to the United States for support and
protection even though this involved having to make serious
concessions to American interests and, of course, participate in a
war in which no British interests were involved other than the
American alliance. Clement Attlee, Ernest Bevan and Co resented being
placed in this subordinate position and hoped that economic recovery
would eventually enable them to deal with the Americans on more equal
terms. For the time being they had to defer to the Americans and
attempt to pass off their subordination as &#8220;influence&#8221;.</p>

<p>What is missing from Phythian&#8217;s account of Labour and the Korean
War is any awareness of the actual conduct of the war. The US Air
Force general Curtis LeMay was quite explicit about the impact of
aerial bombardment: &#8220;We burned down just about every city in North
Korea and South Korea both ... during the three years of warfare we
killed off over a million civilian Koreans and drove several million
more from their homes, with the inevitable additional tragedies bound
to ensue.&#8221; <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> This was a terrible war
that left Korea laid waste. The bombing was carried out with even
less restraint than the United States was to show in Vietnam. The
North Korean capital, Pyongyang, was flattened, a fate that never
befell Hanoi. The Americans used napalm against civilian targets on
an astonishing scale. According to one authoritative account, the US
Air Force &#8220;on an average day ... dropped 45,000 gallons&#8221; of
napalm. On 29 August 1952 (by now Labour was in opposition) the
Americans carried out their heaviest raid on Pyongyang, dropping 697
tons of bombs and 10,000 litres of napalm. The raid left 6,000 dead,
overwhelmingly civilians: there was &#8220;only the shell of buildings
and the remaining inhabitants to remind an observer that a city had
ever existed on the site&#8221;. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> Even
Winston Churchill, by now prime minister, complained of how the
Americans were &#8220;splashing it [napalm] about all over the civilian
population. I will take no responsibility for it.&#8221; <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>
The Labour front bench was silent.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Attlee did manage to dress British subordination up
as influence. At the end of November 1950 President Truman announced
that the use of nuclear weapons was under consideration, prompting
Attlee to fly to Washington on 4 December and supposedly exercise a
restraining hand on the Americans. This, as Ralph Miliband put it, is
&#8220;a legend&#8221;. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> The British received
no right of veto over the use of atomic bombs, but were assured that
they would be the first to know if the decision was taken. What we
can be certain of is that if the Americans had used nuclear weapons,
the Labour government, with whatever reservations, would have
supported them. It is worth remembering that Attlee, not Churchill,
was prime minister when Hiroshima and Nagasaki were atom bombed.</p>

<p>Attlee&#8217;s concern, moreover, was not with the loss of Korean or
Chinese lives, but with the danger of the war expanding to involve
the Soviet Union. The Russians were in a position to retaliate with
nuclear weapons, and Britain, with its US bases, would have been a
prime target. Labour had, of course, allowed the Americans to
establish air bases for B-29 bombers in Britain in the summer of
1949, and the following year these were equipped with nuclear
weapons. The Labour government did not secure any effective veto over
their use, let alone over the use of nuclear weapons in Korea. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>
And, as Ralph Miliband once again points out, on two occasions in May
and September 1951 the Labour government assured the Americans that
it would support military action against China. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>Far from Blair&#8217;s support for the United States being some sort
of aberration, he can clearly be seen as continuing the policy of
junior partnership begun by Attlee and Bevin. There is a dreadful
continuity here, even down to the attempt to dress up subordination
as influence. In 1952 Hugh Gaitskell, soon to become Labour leader,
urged that more effort had to be made to present the American
alliance as a partnership because otherwise Britain looked &#8220;too
much like a satellite&#8221;. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> This has
remained a problem.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">From Vietnam to Iraq</h4>

<p class="fst">With regard to the Vietnam War, Phythian considers Harold Wilson&#8217;s
greatest achievement to be &#8220;a negative one &#8211; not committing
British troops&#8221;. His refusal certainly marks his government out as
an aberration. How far this was Wilson&#8217;s achievement is another
matter. The Wilson government was every bit as committed to the
American alliance as Attlee and Bevin had been. He was, for example,
to collaborate in the CIA&#8217;s overthrow of Cheddi Jagan&#8217;s
government in British Guiana, still a British colony. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a>
The problem for Wilson was that he came to power in 1964 with a
majority of only four in the House of Commons and was reliant for his
position on the left of the Labour Party. He was, moreover,
threatened by powerful rivals on the right: George Brown, James
Callaghan and Roy Jenkins. This seriously limited the options
available to him. If Hugh Gaitskell had still been Labour leader in
1964 he would certainly have despatched a token force to fight
alongside the Americans regardless of the Labour left. Indeed in
August 1965 George Brown actually argued that if Gaitskell were prime
minister he &#8220;would have put a token force in Vietnam last fall&#8221;.
<a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a> Was Wilson any different?</p>

<p>The only reason Wilson did not send troops to Vietnam was because
he dare not, with a majority of four, while dependent on the Labour
left. Given his general support for the American alliance and his
consistent support for the American war in Vietnam, it seems certain
that if he had had a large enough majority, then troops would have
been sent. By the time Wilson had won a large majority in 1966 the
war&#8217;s unpopularity, together with scepticism about the prospects of
American victory, led to a continued refusal to send even a token
force. There was, it must be remembered, not just opposition to the
war, but growing support for the Vietcong.</p>

<p>Wilson&#8217;s refusal to send troops was not the result of any
&#8220;instinctive pacifism&#8221; on the part of the Labour government,
which was at the very same time engaged in confrontation with
Indonesia and fighting a guerrilla insurgency in South Arabia. And,
of course, the government was wholehearted in its diplomatic support
of the war, indeed it bent over backwards to give the Americans every
assistance short of troops on the ground. The US ambassador, David
Bruce, explained Wilson&#8217;s occasional public criticisms of US policy
as necessary &#8220;to counter the charge of being a mere puppet or
satellite of the US&#8221;. The Labour government would, he informed
President Johnson, have to sometimes &#8220;assert its independence by
taking exception to certain details of policies to which he is ready
to give general support&#8221;. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> And,
as we now know, when Wilson disassociated his government from the
escalation of American bombing of North Vietnam in June 1966, the
statement was actually agreed with the Americans beforehand. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p>Once again it is worth remembering that the Labour government was
supporting an American war that involved an unprecedented level of
bombing of both the North and the South, the use of death squads and
widespread torture (the Phoenix Programme), the routine brutalisation
and murder of civilians culminating in numerous massacres &#8211; indeed,
just about every war crime imaginable. Supporting this war was not an
achievement of any sort.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the Iraq war. Here, according to Phythian,
Blair broke with Labour tradition by supporting the Americans. This
break is portrayed as very much Blair&#8217;s responsibility. What
Phythian does not explain is why the United States went to war in
Iraq, which is surely a necessary preliminary in understanding
British participation.</p>

<p>The war was fought to secure US domination over the Middle East.
Everything else was a pretext. The British decision to participate
was motivated by a continuing belief that American power was
necessary to protect British global interests, and more particularly
by a determination to be a beneficiary of the American victory. This
was not some idiosyncrasy of Blair&#8217;s. When in July 2002 he told a
meeting of senior officials and ministers that not to go into Iraq
with the Americans &#8220;would be the biggest shift in foreign policy
for 50 years&#8221;, he was absolutely right. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a>
When it was said that &#8220;supporting the Americans is part of Tony&#8217;s
DNA&#8221;, this was once again absolutely right, but the same is true of
the British state itself.</p>

<p>Under New Labour the British Army has been reconfigured to fight
in America&#8217;s wars; the British intelligence services have an ever
closer relationship with the Americans (the presence of a CIA
representative on the Joint Intelligence Committee in the run up to
the Iraq war seems to have escaped the various inquiries) <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>,
the British arms industry is increasingly tied to the US military
industrial complex with parts of the Ministry of Defence being
privatised, sold off to companies with US involvement, and, of
course, Britain&#8217;s independent nuclear deterrent is completely
dependent on the Americans. None of this is new, but it has reached
new levels under New Labour. Far from being an aberration, Blair was
the culmination of the Labour Party&#8217;s post-1945 commitment to the
American alliance.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f4" name="n4">4.</a> Phythian is not alone in his
idealist account of Labour foreign policy and the problems it
involves. Rhiannon Vickers, for example, can emphasise the party&#8217;s
&#8220;belief in anti-militarism&#8221; and then go on to argue a couple of
pages later that &#8220;Labour when in power, however, tended to view
Britain&#8217;s need for a strong military in much the same way its
opponents did. To some extent, it had to be more hardline when in
government than the Conservatives because of its apparent weakness in
the eyes of the electorate on the issue of defence. Thus, while
Labour&#8217;s instinct has been for anti-militarism, its policies have
not.&#8221; See Vickers, 2003, pp.&nbsp;201, 203. An instinct, it has to
be said, is something one cannot help acting upon, rather than
something that has no relation to what one does other than help cover it up.</p>

Phythian describes the visit as &#8220;a qualified success&#8221; (p.&nbsp;45).
Ralph Miliband was, of course, the father of David Miliband, the New
Labour foreign secretary and Ed Miliband, another cabinet member. As
the joke goes, the father argued that the Labour Party would always
betray the working class, and the sons have helped prove him right.
At the end of his <strong>Parliamentary Socialism</strong>, Miliband called for
socialists to abandon &#8220;the belief that the Labour Party will
eventually be radically transformed&#8221; and to begin preparing the
ground for a socialist alternative. He urged that part of that
preparation &#8220;is the dissipation of paralysing illusions about the
true purpose and role of the Labour Party&#8221; (p.&nbsp;377). He
certainly seems to have convinced his sons that the Labour Party was
not socialist and, as they weren&#8217;t either, they promptly joined.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f9" name="n9">9.</a> In her <strong>Old World, New World</strong>
(2007), Kathleen Burk quotes an incredulous US Air Force commander
saying, &#8220;Never before in history has one first class power gone
into another first class power&#8217;s country without any agreement&#8221;
(p.&nbsp;595). Not until October 1951 was &#8220;an agreement of sorts
reached&#8221; (p7.&nbsp;57).</p>

Rabe, 2005. Jagan had already been removed from office once before in
1953. The Conservative government in London regarded him as
dangerously left wing. The Labour opposition gave them their full support.</p>

close relationship is that the current head of the Royal Institute of
International Affairs, better known as Chatham House, is a former CIA
analyst, DeAnne Julius. She worked for the CIA in the early 1970s.
Gordon Brown first brought her into the British establishment in 1997
when he appointed her to the Bank of England&#8217;s Monetary Policy
Committee. For some reason her biography on the Chatham House website
does not mention her time with the CIA.</p>
