<br />
<p class="fst">&#8220;The distribution of income in Britain has now become so unequal
that it is beginning to resemble a Third World country&#8221;, wrote
Gordon Brown in his 1989 indictment of Thatcherism, <strong>Where There Is
Greed</strong>. He complained that since 1979 &#8220;an extraordinary transfer
of resources, from poor to rich, has taken place&#8221;. Indeed, so great
had the level of inequality become that it was &#8220;difficult to argue
that there remains even a common interest between the top 1 percent
to whom Mrs Thatcher has given so much, and the rest of the nation&#8221;.
And, of course, inequality was even more glaring with regard to the
distribution of wealth. According to Brown, the richest 10 percent of
the population owned more than 50 percent of the wealth, while the
bottom 50 percent of the population owned only 7 percent. Even more
outrageous, under Thatcher &#8220;the wealth of the top 1 percent, who
now own 17 percent, had more than doubled&#8221;. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
Remember, this was written in 1989 and the situation was to get
considerably worse in the run-up to Labour&#8217;s 1997 election victory.</p>

<p>Now that he has been chancellor of the exchequer for ten years in
a New Labour government with a large majority, what has Brown done to
remedy the injustices and inequalities of the Thatcher years? Not
only has he done nothing to reverse &#8220;the extraordinary transfer of
resources from the poor to the rich&#8221; that so outraged him in 1989;
under New Labour the situation has continued to get worse. When New
Labour came to power in 1997 the proportion of the country&#8217;s wealth
in the hands of the richest 1 percent had reached 20 percent. By
2004, with Brown as chancellor, it had increased to 24 percent. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>
According to one commentator, the 600,000 individuals who make up the
richest 1 percent were, on average, &#163;737,000 richer than they had
been under the Conservatives. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> More
recently, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, 2005&#8211;6 saw
both relative and absolute poverty increase. The institute reported
that income inequality today is &#8220;higher than Labour inherited by a
statistically significant amount&#8221;. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>
Brown is still trumpeted as the Labour Party&#8217;s most successful
chancellor ever.</p>

<p>In <strong>Where There Is Greed</strong> Brown not only condemned increasing
inequality under Thatcher, but also savaged the Conservative policy
of privatisation. He was particularly critical of the dramatic
increases in pay that the top executives of the privatised utilities
awarded themselves. He also censured the erosion of civil liberties
under the Conservatives, complaining that &#8220;information on
individuals is now compiled and held on an unprecedented scale&#8221; and
that &#8220;the right of assembly and the right to protest have been
curtailed in ways that were not contemplated under any other post-war
Conservative administration&#8221;. New Labour have, of course, far
surpassed the Tories in their assault on civil liberties &#8211; with
Brown&#8217;s full support. But back in 1989 he even complained of the
government allowing &#8220;the Murdoch empire&#8221; to take over the <em>Times</em>.</p>

<p>What was Brown&#8217;s answer to all this? &#8220;Socialism has always
been about more than equality,&#8221; Brown insisted, very deliberately
distancing himself from the Labour right. Indeed, he warned that
hard-won political and social rights were always in danger while they
&#8220;existed side by side with huge concentrations of private
unaccountable power&#8221;. The way forward was to forge &#8220;a strong
economic democracy&#8221;. This was his vision of socialism. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p>How did Gordon Brown, the champion of &#8220;a strong economic
democracy&#8221;, become the champion of privatisation, of the market, of
the interests of the super-rich, of globalisation, of the whole
neoliberal agenda? The Brown who in 1989 warned of the danger posed
by &#8220;huge concentrations of private unaccountable power&#8221; went on
to embrace them, court them and govern in their interests. And this
was openly celebrated: in March 2006, for example, Brown proudly
announced the establishment of an International Business Advisory
Council to help ensure that British economic policy remained in the
best interests of global capital. Its members included Lee Scott,
president and chief executive officer (CEO) of WalMart; Lord Browne,
chief executive of BP; Jean Pierre Garnier, CEO of GlaxoSmithKline;
Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft; Robert Rubin, chairman of
Citigroup; Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata Group; Sir John Rose, CEO
of Rolls Royce; Sir Terry Leahy, CEO of Tesco; and Meg Whitman, CEO
of eBay. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> Needless to say, these
people are not friends of the labour movement, either in Britain or
abroad; they are its enemies, extreme examples of those whose huge
wealth Brown had once considered made it difficult to believe that
they still had any &#8220;common interest&#8221; with the rest of humanity.</p>

<p>Brown&#8217;s courtship of Rupert Murdoch, conducted in competition
with Tony Blair, has been even more grotesque. This competition
between the prime minister and chancellor led Murdoch to complain in
a recent interview that whenever he visited Britain he always had to
&#8220;have tea&#8221; with both men &#8220;or they are very suspicious that you
are lining up with the other one&#8221;. For Murdoch, the test for Brown
as prime minister will be &#8220;how much would he let the private sector
get involved in health and education&#8221;. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>
This courtship of the reactionary, union-busting, tax-dodging
Murdoch, something unprecedented in Labour Party history, tells us
everything we need to know about the politics of New Labour.</p>

<p>This article will examine how Brown got to where he is today. It
will chronicle and attempt to explain his remarkable trajectory from
student radical to left Labour MP to becoming one of the principal
architects of New Labour and, at last, to the enthusiastic embrace of
neoliberalism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Student radical</h4>

<p class="fst">Brown was born in 1951, the son of a Presbyterian minister. He was
brought up in a middle class household with a strong social
conscience. In 1967 he arrived, aged 16 and with this social
conscience still intact, as a student at Edinburgh University. Here
Brown, along with thousands of others, found himself part of a
student revolt. Although he was certainly influenced by the radical
ideas of the time, Brown never embraced the politics of direct action
and in 1969 he joined the Labour Party. This did not involve any
commitment to Harold Wilson&#8217;s Labour government, but rather a
belief that the Labour Party in Scotland could be transformed into a
vehicle for radical change. Brown first came to prominence as a
student politician in 1970 when the university principal, Michael
Swann, categorically denied that the university had investments in
any companies involved in apartheid South Africa. This was a lie of
Blairite proportions. Brown received leaked documentary proof of
this, and a special issue of the student newspaper was produced to
expose the scandal. He went on to get a first class degree and began
a PhD on the history of the Scottish Labour Party.</p>

<p>Brown continued to be involved in student politics and in 1972
campaigned on a &#8220;student power&#8221; platform for election as rector
of the university. The rectorship was an office elected by students,
usually contested by various notables and celebrities, and, once
elected, the rector only ever played a nominal role. To the horror of
the university authorities, Brown won an overwhelming victory, and
immediately demanded that the university should support the campaign
for increased grants. During his time as rector, he argued for
working class representation on the university court, proposing that
two vacancies be filled by the president of Edinburgh Trades Council
and by the secretary of a tenants&#8217; association. In retrospect,
Brown was to regret this protracted involvement in student politics,
but to his credit he was actively involved in the Chile Solidarity
Campaign, set up in response to the CIA-sponsored military coup that
overthrew the government of Salvadore Allende on 11 September 1973
(&#8220;the other 9/11&#8221;), and supported the miners during the 1974
strike that brought down the Heath government. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p>It was in this period of military coups, American defeat in
Vietnam and governments brought down by industrial action that Brown
edited <strong>The Red Paper on Scotland</strong>, a collection of articles
published in 1975. It was a new leftish celebration of radical
politics, which included contributions from Tom Nairn, John McGrath,
John Foster, Robin Cook and others. Brown&#8217;s own contribution
condemned &#8220;the gross inequalities which disfigure Scottish life&#8221;,
and argued that the times cried out for &#8220;a new commitment to
socialist ideals&#8221;. He urged &#8220;a coherent strategy&#8221; of reforms
designed &#8220;to cancel the logic of capitalism&#8221; and to lead &#8220;us
out of one social order into another&#8221;. This would involve &#8220;a
phased extension of public control under workers&#8217; self-management
and the prioritising of social needs by the communities themselves&#8221;.
He called for &#8220;a planned economy&#8221; and for &#8220;workers&#8217; power&#8221;,
identifying himself with &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s socialist pioneers, Hardie,
Smillie, Maxton, Maclean, Gallacher, Wheatley and others&#8221; &#8211; a
pantheon that included both revolutionary and reformist socialists.
What was needed was &#8220;a positive commitment to creating a socialist
society&#8221;. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p>Brown&#8217;s student activism denied him a teaching post at Edinburgh
University. Instead he got a post at Glasgow College of Technology in
1976, and in 1980 gave up academic life to work as a producer at
Scottish Television. Brown was elected onto the executive of the
Scottish Labour Party in 1976 and eventually, in 1983, was elected
Labour MP for Dunfermline East in the face of Thatcher&#8217;s
post-Falklands general election victory.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Labour MP</h4>

<p class="fst">Brown became a Labour MP as the Thatcher government&#8217;s assault on
the labour movement was moving towards a climax with the Great
Miners&#8217; Strike of 1984&#8211;5. He confronted this turning point in the
class struggle as a left wing Labour MP, someone who was never to
embrace Bennism, but who nevertheless continued to advocate a
reformism that he believed would raise up the working class, confound
the capitalist enemy and accomplish a peaceful transition to
socialism. In 1983, together with Robin Cook, he published a powerful
collection of articles on poverty and deprivation in Scotland
entitled <strong>Scotland: The Real Divide.</strong> In his introduction Brown
argued that the &#8220;first prerequisite for eradicating poverty is the
redistribution of income and wealth from rich to poor&#8221;. In what
reads like an indictment of his later policies as chancellor, Brown insisted:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Taxation should rise progressively with income.
Programmes that merely redistribute poverty from families to single
persons, from the old to the young, from the sick to the healthy, are
not a solution. What is needed is a programme of reform that ends the
current situation where the top 10 percent of the population own 80
percent of the wealth and 30 percent of the income, even after tax.
As Tawney remarked, &#8220;What some people call a problem of poverty,
others call the problem of riches.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Such views would later become anathema. At the time, however, he
was adamant that &#8220;the goal would not simply be the minimalist one
of equalising opportunities, a strategy akin to what Tawney described
as &#8216;the impertinent courtesy of an invitation to unwelcome guests
in the certainty that circumstances would prevent them from accepting
it&#8217;.&#8221; So much for the cornerstone of New Labour&#8217;s claim to be
&#8220;progressive&#8221; today. Moreover, a crucial point of the package of
reforms that Brown was advocating was that taxation of the rich
should be increased &#8211; increased, that is, from the then top rate of
60 percent. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>The 1984&#8211;5 miners&#8217; strike was the most bitter and hard fought
class struggle in Britain since before the Second World War. It was a
decisive moment when the opportunity to defeat Thatcherism was lost
and the labour movement went down to a historic defeat. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a>
In Scotland, Brown gave the miners his full support throughout the
battle, appearing on picket lines, donating a significant proportion
of his salary and challenging the Thatcher government&#8217;s decision to
confiscate the benefits of striking miners&#8217; families. His
commitment to the miners&#8217; cause earned him honorary membership of
the Scottish Miners&#8217; Union. In the aftermath of the strike he
published his biography of the Scottish leader of the Independent
Labour Party (ILP), James Maxton, a labour of love that it had taken
him 20 years to write. Maxton was one of the great spokesmen for
reformist socialism in the period between the two world wars. He
supported workers&#8217; struggles, savagely attacked the capitalist
class and was a constant critic of the compromises and betrayals of
the Labour Party leadership that were to culminate with Ramsay
Macdonald&#8217;s defection to the Conservatives in 1931. The collapse of
the Labour government saw Maxton lead the ILP out of the Labour Party
in 1932. He condemned the Labour Party as irredeemably compromised
and no longer a vehicle for socialist change. Any sympathy with
Maxton would be inconceivable for the Gordon Brown of today, but the
Brown of the mid-1980s was different. He produced a sympathetic and
scholarly account that celebrated a tradition of militant reformism,
an account that was still fuelled by anger at the defeat of the miners.</p>

<p>Some commentators have seen the book as marking a turning point
for Brown: he celebrates Maxton&#8217;s principled intransigence, but in
the end rejects it because it can only lead to political impotence.
This is to read Brown&#8217;s subsequent trajectory into the book in a
way that is not substantiated by the actual text. Certainly Brown
acknowledges contemporary criticisms of Maxton&#8217;s &#8220;purism&#8221;, but
he goes on to reject them. He insists, &#8220;Maxton&#8217;s journey through
the politics of the twenties and thirties must be viewed in context.&#8221;
Just at the moment when the Great Depression &#8220;cried out for a
radical political response, the British Labour Party seemed
immobilised, frozen by the enormity of the challenge&#8221;. The great
weight of his criticism is of the Labour Party, not of Maxton. There
is, I would argue, no doubt that at this time Brown&#8217;s loyalties
still lay with some sort of militant reformism. The book ends with a
strong endorsement of Maxton&#8217;s socialist vision. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>We have already looked at Brown&#8217;s 1989 book, <strong>Where There Is
Greed</strong>, a book in which he continues to condemn Thatcher and all
her works and argues for a left Keynesian reformism. What was to
transform him into a champion of neoliberalism?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Architect of New Labour?</h4>

<p class="fst">One of the problems with bourgeois political science as it is
practised in British universities is that it focuses on the shadows
cast by the class struggle rather than on the class struggle itself.
From this point of view New Labour is regarded primarily as an
electoral phenomenon, as a necessary step if the Labour Party was to
secure the votes of the Thatcherite middle class and have any chance
of taking power. The problem with this particular view of politics is
that it ignores, indeed helps conceal, the way that power is actually
exercised in capitalist societies, and in particular it renders the
ruling class invisible. The reality is that New Labour was the
product of class struggle or, more to the point, of defeat in the
class struggle. The emergence of New Labour was predicated on the
defeat of the miners&#8217; strike and of the print unions (by Rupert
Murdoch) at Wapping. These defeats registered a historic shift in the
balance of class forces in Britain, and New Labour was a product of
that shift. Whereas previous Labour governments had served as
mediators between the trade unions and the capitalist ruling class,
in the aftermath of defeat this was no longer a viable role. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a>
After Thatcher&#8217;s victories the ruling class no longer needed a
party to mediate with the trade unions. If the Labour Party was to
get into government again it needed to make itself acceptable to the
ruling class &#8211; it needed to embrace Thatcherism and transform
itself into the party of business, the party of globalisation. This
was to become Brown&#8217;s objective in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Defeat in the 1992 general election is often seen as decisive in
transforming Brown from a reformist socialist into a neoliberal. In
reality, it only consolidated developments that were already under
way. The task of making Labour acceptable to big business began under
Neil Kinnock, continued under John Smith and was merely carried
forward to completion by Brown and Blair. Whereas, for Blair, the
embrace of neoliberalism involved no great personal struggle because
he had no previous beliefs to dispose of, for Brown it involved a
deliberate decision to change sides. The effort, one suspects,
damaged his personality. Nevertheless, for Brown, the class struggle
was over and the capitalist class had won, both domestically and
globally. Once he had come to terms with this, he embraced the
neoliberal agenda with all the fervour of the recently converted.
While there is no evidence to show that Brown
was ever an admirer of the Soviet Union, at the very least, the
victory of the United States in the Cold War would have reinforced
this conclusion. And it was to the United States that he turned for
the model of the New Jerusalem that beckoned humanity. It began with
an enthusiasm for Bill Clinton, but has since generalised into a
belief that the United States is the global future. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>What seems clear, looking back, is that it was Brown and not Blair
who was the principal architect of New Labour. Blair was more the
salesman. Brown was by far the most substantial of those pushing the
neoliberal agenda within the Labour leadership. George Galloway has
provided an interesting assessment of the calibre of the two men:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Brown was a political titan compared to Blair; as deep as
Blair was shallow, as serious as Blair was slick. Brown versus Blair
was like a contest between Bertrand Russell and Bob Monkhouse (whose
motto, incidentally, could easily be Blair&#8217;s: &#8220;Once you learn how
to fake the sincerity, the rest is easy&#8221;). <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This makes Brown&#8217;s culpability all the greater.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when Labour leader John Smith died from a heart
attack in May 1994, Brown found himself outmanoeuvred for the party
leadership by Blair. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> He regarded
himself as having been betrayed by people he had trusted, something
he has never forgotten or forgiven. His position was still remarkably
strong, however. He extracted from Blair an agreement (the Granita
agreement) that gave him control of economic and social policy in a
future Labour government, together with the promise that Blair would
hand the prime ministership over to him in the not too distant
future. This unprecedented agreement was testimony to the extent to
which Brown was the driving force behind New Labour.</p>

<p>As shadow chancellor, Brown played the decisive role in remaking
the Labour Party as New Labour, &#8220;the party of business&#8221;. In
speech after speech to business leaders, he insisted that Labour had
accepted the results of Thatcherism, embraced market forces, adapted
itself to the supposed realities of globalisation, and cherished the
entrepreneur above all others. He even tried to invent a business
background for himself. In November 1996 Brown told the Confederation
of British Industry conference that &#8220;business is in my blood&#8221;.
His mother had been a company director and &#8220;I was brought up in an
atmosphere where I knew exactly what was happening as far as business
was concerned&#8221;. He was, indeed he had always been, one of them. The
only problem is that it was not true. As his mother subsequently
admitted, she would never have called herself &#8220;a business woman&#8221;:
she had only ever done some &#8220;light administrative duties&#8221; for &#8220;a
small family firm&#8221; and had given up the job when she married, three
years before young Gordon was even born. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>
While there have been Labour politicians who have tried to invent
working class backgrounds for themselves before, Brown is the first
to try and invent a capitalist background.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">&#8220;Britain is made for globalisation&#8221;</h4>

<p class="fst">Since becoming chancellor of the exchequer Brown has regularly
boasted to business audiences, both at home and abroad, of how New
Labour has made Britain &#8220;the most business friendly environment in
Europe&#8221;, although on this particular occasion he did go on to
acknowledge that there was still a lot to learn &#8220;from the
entrepreneurial and flexible labour markets of the American economy&#8221;.
Some of these speeches have been collected in his recently published
<strong>Speeches 1997&#8211;2006</strong>. They provide a wealth of evidence of the
way in which he has transformed himself from a reformist socialist
into a full-blown neoliberal. In a speech to the Social Market
Foundation in February 2002, Brown admitted that making Britain a
paradise for business and the rich had involved &#8220;a break from a
hundred years of Labour history&#8221;. Indeed, he went on to warn that
&#8220;we need to affirm a yet more radical break with Labour&#8217;s past&#8221;.
Whereas, in the past, the left had seen markets as &#8220;leading to
inequality, insecurity and injustice&#8221;, now he could &#8220;assert with
confidence that promoting the market economy helps us to achieve our
goals of a stronger economy and a fairer society&#8221;. He actually went
on in the same speech to accuse the Conservatives of not being
pro-market enough. It had been necessary to make &#8220;fundamental
changes&#8221; to Labour Party policy, but he was now confident that
Britain would &#8220;be a beacon for the world, where enterprise and
fairness march forward together&#8221;.</p>

<p>Brown was even prepared to pay tribute to the contribution made by
Margaret Thatcher, no longer &#8220;the betrayer of Britain&#8217;s future&#8221;,
but the country&#8217;s saviour. In a speech made in July 2004, he was
fulsome in his praise: &#8220;She recognised the need for Britain to
reinvent itself and rediscover a new and vital self-confidence&#8221;.
She, he went on, &#8220;understood that we could gain strength from the
glories of our past which could point the way to a glorious future&#8221;.
While Thatcher had made mistakes, nevertheless there had been many
&#8220;advances, achievements and important changes&#8221;. In this same
speech, he recited some of &#8220;the real achievements&#8221; of Britain&#8217;s
glorious past, which included the country&#8217;s &#8220;imperial mission&#8221;
and the fact that Britain was once &#8220;centre to the world&#8217;s largest
empire &#8211; the global economy of the day&#8221;.</p>

<p>What was needed, according to Brown, was not just the
transformation of the Labour Party into &#8220;the party of business&#8221;,
but the transformation of British culture. In July 2001 he urged that
&#8220;a truly entrepreneurial culture&#8221; should be created in Britain.
He went on:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We want every young person to hear about business and
enterprise in schools; every college student to be made aware of the
opportunities in business and to start a business; every teacher to
be able to communicate the virtues and potential of business and enterprise.</p>

<p class="fst">Socialism, for Brown (and he still used the word to trade union
and Labour Party audiences), had become &#8220;the creation of a deeper
and wider entrepreneurial culture where enterprise is truly open to
all&#8221;. One can imagine the outcry if any previous Labour government
had ever suggested that schools should inculcate socialist values or
trade union solidarity!</p>

<p>Brown returned to this theme later the following year (December
2002) in a speech to the Growing Business Awards. New Labour, he
boasted, had &#8220;done a lot to make businessmen and women role models
for young people&#8221; and to &#8220;make successful business leaders role
models in every community&#8221;. They were creating &#8220;a wider and
deeper enterprise culture&#8221;. In effect, British culture had to be &#8220;Americanised&#8221;.</p>

<p>On 2 December 2005, addressing business leaders at the Advancing
Enterprise Conference in London, Brown welcomed the event as &#8220;a
concrete expression of our partnership&#8221;. They had &#8220;a shared
agenda&#8221; and New Labour could be relied on to &#8220;take it forward&#8221;.
He was, he told his audience, particularly looking forward to the
session on &#8220;our educational priorities&#8221; that was being led by
that great educationalist Terry Leahy, the chief executive officer of
Tesco. Brown promised them that &#8220;if we work together then I believe
we shall prove that Britain is made for globalisation and
globalisation is made for Britain&#8221;. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The politics of spin</h4>

<p class="fst">One point worth considering is how it is that Brown has still
managed to appear to some people (admittedly a declining number) as
being to the left of Blair. To a considerable extent this has been
the result of &#8220;spin&#8221;, reinforcing wishful thinking, although it
also derives from a very deliberate effort, in which Brown has played
an important part, to locate New Labour within the Labour Party
tradition, arguing that it is a development of &#8220;Croslandism&#8221;. Let
us consider the question of &#8220;spin&#8221; first.</p>

<p>In 1998, in what one commentator described as a &#8220;frenzy of
privatisation&#8221; that &#8220;bordered on the messianic&#8221;, Brown proposed
the privatisation of the Post Office. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a>
This was opposed by the then secretary of state for trade and
industry, Peter Mandelson, who instead proposed that it be retained
in the public sector, but be given commercial &#8220;freedom&#8221;. In this
particular battle Mandelson carried the day. Charlie Whelan, Brown&#8217;s
press officer, gave two alternative briefings, &#8220;one to
right-leaning papers claiming that Mandelson had funked a desirable
privatisation of the Post Office, and another to left-leaning papers
and the trade unions, that Brown had &#8216;saved&#8217; the Post Office from
privatisation&#8221;. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>Much the same story can be told with regard to the minimum wage.
This is inevitably championed as one of the great achievements of New
Labour by its supporters. Brown, however, only agreed to it because
experience in the United States, where there has been a minimum wage
since 1938, showed that it was not a serious inconvenience to
business. Indeed in the United States the minimum wage has proven to
be perfectly compatible with the sustained attack on working class
living standards and workplace conditions that has been under way
since the 1980s. All that had to be ensured was that the minimum wage
was set low enough. In Britain, as Simon Jenkins observed, it was set
so low &#8220;as to be almost invisible&#8221;. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a>
The man responsible for this was Gordon Brown.</p>

<p>When it was proposed that the minimum wage should be set at &#163;3.70
an hour, Brown insisted that the most business could afford was
&#163;3.50. In the face of his intransigence, TUC general secretary John
Monks, certainly no militant, intervened. Monks, according to Tom
Bower, was &#8220;puzzled that Brown, posing as the champion of the
working class and diligently attending the birthday parties of the
movement&#8217;s leaders, could suggest that the economy was unable to
afford the increase&#8221;. Monks warned Brown that if he did not drop
his opposition he would make it public and thereby &#8220;put an end to
Brown&#8217;s bid to become the Labour Party&#8217;s next leader&#8221;. Brown
retreated, but once again Charlie Whelan spun the story to his
advantage. Stephen Byers, who had replaced Mandelson as secretary of
state for trade and industry, had publicly advocated a rate of &#163;3.60
an hour. Brown threw his weight behind this. Whelan now briefed
journalists that Brown had always favoured &#163;3.70, but had been
forced &#8220;to compromise with Byers ... and accept a &#163;3.60 minimum
wage&#8221;. Brown did still insist, however, that the full rate should
be payable, not from age 21 as the Low Pay Unit (LPU) urged, but from
age 22. When George Bain of the LPU told him that only 8,000 young
people were affected, Brown remained adamant, telling Bain, &#8220;I
won&#8217;t allow 21 year olds to be classed as adults&#8221;. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">&#8220;Croslandism&#8221; and New Labour</h4>

<p class="fst">While &#8220;spin&#8221; is the main factor in accounting for whatever
remnants of a left reputation Brown still has, he has also been
centrally involved in the effort to identify New Labour as a species
of &#8220;Croslandism&#8221;. This fascination with the intellectual
standard-bearer of the right wing of the Labour Party in the 1950s
and 1960s is rather sudden. In the &#8220;anthology of Socialism&#8221;,
<strong>Values, Visions and Voices</strong>, that Brown co-edited with Tony
Wright in 1995, there are only four contributions from Crosland&#8217;s
writings out of nearly 200 selected extracts. Even that intellectual
giant Neil Kinnock has five contributions! <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a>
By early 1997, however, Brown had decided to lay claim to &#8220;Crosland&#8217;s
rich and lasting legacy to Labour&#8221;. He was aware of the need to at
least maintain the pretence that New Labour still had some connection
with &#8220;Old Labour&#8221;, even if it was with the Labour right. He
fastened on &#8220;Croslandism&#8221; as the way to achieve this. In a speech
that was later published in an edited volume, <strong>Crosland and New
Labour</strong>, Brown emphasised the way that Crosland had placed
&#8220;equality&#8221; at the centre of the Socialist project. This was what
New Labour was all about, Brown argued: &#8220;everyone should have the
chance to bridge the gap between what they are and what they have it
in themselves to become&#8221;. Brown tried to update Crosland&#8217;s
understanding of equality with a more modern New Labour definition:
&#8220;employment opportunity for all&#8221;, &#8220;continuing and lifelong
educational opportunity&#8221;, &#8220;genuine access to culture&#8221; and &#8220;a
redistribution of power that offers people real control over the
decisions that affect their lives&#8221;.</p>

<p>The great advantage of this updating of the definition of equality
is that it is perfectly compatible with &#8220;inequality&#8221;. And,
moreover, one of the ways that power is to be redistributed is
through the market! What Brown is about is substituting &#8220;equality
of opportunity&#8221; for equality of wealth and income &#8211; that everyone
should have an equal opportunity to become rich. This, of course, has
a particular attraction for today&#8217;s Parliamentary Labour Party. To
be fair though, Brown does concede that &#8220;even in a global
marketplace&#8221;, it might still prove necessary to &#8220;address wealth
and income inequalities&#8221;. &#8220;I believe&#8221;, he wrote, &#8220;that these
inequalities can be justified only if they are in the interests of
the least fortunate.&#8221; This truly original contribution to socialist
thought looks remarkably like the good old &#8220;trickle-down&#8221; effect
championed by the Thatcherites. At the very least, it leaves him with
considerable leeway. Indeed, judging from his performance as
chancellor, he has yet to find any of the increasing levels of
inequality in New Labour Britain that are not in the interests of
&#8220;the least fortunate&#8221;. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p>More recently, in 2006, Brown contributed an introduction to a new
edition of Anthony Crosland&#8217;s <strong>The Future of Socialism</strong>. First
published in 1956, this book was the intellectual mainstay of
Labour&#8217;s right wing, the bible of Gaitskellite revisionism. Now, 50
years later, Brown celebrated its publication as &#8220;a decisive moment
in post-war Labour history&#8221; and praised its &#8220;freshness&#8221; and
&#8220;relevance&#8221;. What Crosland showed was that Socialism &#8220;was about
the dignity of human beings and the equal right of each individual to
realise their potential in a supportive community&#8221;. Socialism was
&#8220;opportunity for all&#8221;. All of Brown&#8217;s earlier campaigning for
&#8220;the redistribution of income and wealth from rich to poor&#8221; was
effectively repudiated. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p>This supposed commitment to equality has become central to New
Labour&#8217;s claim to be a party of &#8220;the centre-left&#8221;. They are
absolutely passionate about it, so much so that, when it was proposed
to include an explicit unambiguous commitment to equality in the
Labour Party&#8217;s new Clause IV in 1995, Peter Mandelson had it
removed. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a> Nevertheless &#8220;equality&#8221;
continues to be a tricky concept, encouraging all sorts of unhelpful
ideas and attitudes. It has to be continually redefined so as to pose
no threat to the rich and the super-rich. The most promising
redefinition so far has been that provided by the Equalities Review,
set up by Blair in 2005. A panel consisting of Trevor Phillips; Sir
Robert Kerslake, the chief executive of Sheffield Council; and Dame
Judith Mayhew Jonas, a top lawyer who was made a dame for her
services to the City, deliberated at great expense. They came up with
something so spurious as to take the breath away:</p>

<p class="quoteb">An equal society protects and promotes equal, real
freedom and substantive opportunity to live in the ways people value
and would choose so that everyone can flourish. An equal society
recognises people&#8217;s different needs, situations and goals and
removes the barriers that limit what people can do and can be. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This is New Labour at its most intellectually rigorous.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">&#8220;Old Labour&#8221;</h4>

<p class="fst">What would Anthony Crosland himself have made of all this?
Crosland, after a brief flirtation with Stalinism at university,
positioned himself on the right of the Labour Party in the early
years of the Second World War. As early as 1941, while serving in the
army, he had stated his intention to be &#8220;the modern Bernstein&#8221;
who would defeat Marxist influence within the labour movement. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a>
<strong>The Future of Socialism</strong> was his attempt at realising this
ambition. What is crucial for our purposes is that Crosland&#8217;s
arguments were premised on a belief that capitalism had been
defeated, tamed, fundamentally changed, and that all that remained
for the left was the implementation of a programme of democratic
reforms, including &#8220;democratic equality&#8221;. New Labour is founded
on the very opposite premise, on the belief that capitalism has
triumphed and that the left has been defeated once and for all. There
is nothing in Crosland&#8217;s writings to suggest that he would have
responded to this defeat in the way that Brown and New Labour have.
From this point of view Roy Hattersley, a vocal opponent of New
Labour, can be best seen as Crosland&#8217;s heir. One obvious
consequence of the difference in context is worth pointing out: New
Labour is far to the right of anything that Crosland and the Labour
right would ever have contemplated in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.
Indeed, New Labour is to the right of the Conservatives in this period.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Crosland had a much more robust attitude to
equality, or &#8220;democratic equality&#8221; as he called it, than anything
evidenced by New Labour. While Brown has tried to redefine equality
as a watered down equality of opportunity, Crosland explicitly ruled
that out. Indeed, he described equality of opportunity as &#8220;the
doctrine of Tory radicalism&#8221;. What Crosland, a Labour right winger,
called for were &#8220;measures ... to equalise the distribution of
rewards and privileges so as to diminish the degree of class
stratification, the injustice of large inequalities and the
collective discontent&#8221;. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a> This
certainly did not amount to socialism, but nevertheless, it has
nothing in common with New Labour.</p>

<p>In 1962 Crosland published another book, <strong>The Conservative
Enemy</strong>. Here he was even more forthright than in the earlier
volume. According to Crosland, inequality in Britain was &#8220;still
greater than should be tolerated in a democracy&#8221; (it was less than
today) and he complained of the rich receiving rewards &#8220;far higher
than any civilised person should want or need&#8221; (they received
considerably less than today). He urged that a future Labour
government &#8220;must grapple with the maldistribution of property&#8221;.
He was particularly critical of the concentration of newspaper
ownership which was a threat to &#8220;a healthy democracy&#8221; and was
contemptuous of &#8220;the more depraved and poisonous of the capitalist
press&#8221;. This was, of course, long before the advent of Rupert
Murdoch. In short, Crosland would not have recognised New Labour as
Labour at all. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p>Crosland talked more radically than he was ever prepared to act.
Most famously, while secretary of state for education he had
remarked: &#8220;If it&#8217;s the last thing I do, I&#8217;m going to destroy
every fucking grammar school in England.&#8221; <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a>
In practice, he rejected the compulsory introduction of comprehensive
schemes in favour of &#8220;persuasion&#8221;, which is why there are still
grammar schools today. Similarly, while he argued that the state
should take over the public schools and democratise them, he never
actually did anything about it when in office. He certainly never
suggested that the public schools should be invited to take over
state schools as New Labour does today. Nevertheless, during the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) crisis that crippled James
Callaghan&#8217;s Labour government in 1976, Crosland was one of those
arguing for rejection of the IMF&#8217;s demand for cuts in government
spending. What is the point of the government surviving, he
complained, &#8220;if Labour measures can&#8217;t be implemented&#8221;.
Callaghan&#8217;s government, he went on, &#8220;is the most right wing
Labour government we&#8217;ve had for years&#8221;. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a>
He had not, as they say, seen anything yet.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">New Labour in power</h4>

<p class="fst">Brown&#8217;s wholehearted commitment to markets, globalisation and
today&#8217;s rampant capitalism was made absolutely clear to the whole
world by the decision to make the Bank of England independent. He was
showing the capitalist class, both at home and abroad, that he was
their man and that New Labour was their government. As one
sympathetic historian observed, &#8220;At a stroke much of the political
economy of the Labour Party since 1945 was abandoned.&#8221; <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a>
It is worth remembering that at least one of the reasons Clement
Attlee&#8217;s government had nationalised the bank had been because of
its role in the 1931 financial crisis, which had brought down Ramsay
MacDonald&#8217;s government and seen him defect to the Conservatives.
The bank had represented the interests of international finance,
rather than the interests of the Labour government. This was never to
be allowed to happen again, although the reality was that the bank
always retained considerable independence. What Brown&#8217;s action
signalled was that New Labour would never find itself in conflict
with international finance. Brown had out-Thatchered the
Thatcherites. His &#8220;great political coup&#8221; successfully positioned
New Labour to the right of the Conservatives. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a>
Brown was committed to what can usefully be described as
&#8220;globalisation in one country&#8221;. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a>
What followed was Brown&#8217;s rush to privatise as he came out as
&#8220;Thatcherism&#8217;s most coveted St Paul&#8221;. As Simon Jenkins observes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Brown tore up all he had said in opposition and hurled
himself into a frenzy of privatisation, scouring the cupboard for
things to sell. He faced down union opposition by seeking to dispose
of air traffic control, the Royal Mint, the Commonwealth Development
Corporation, and Tote on-course betting. The privatisation of the
Post Office ... was halted in 1998 only because its departmental
sponsor was Brown&#8217;s sworn enemy, Mandelson ... Privatisation spread
even to Whitehall. The Inland Revenue sold its entire estate to a
property developer, John Ritblat, who transferred it, quite legally,
to an off-shore tax haven ... The Treasury even sold and then leased
back its own headquarters in Parliament Square.</p>

<p class="fst">Brown&#8217;s frenzy of privatisation has yet to run its course. His
supposed opposition to privatisation in education and the NHS is
largely a matter of spin and of the factionalism within the New
Labour government. Brown has carried big business into areas of the
public sector that the Thatcherites never dreamed of.</p>

<p>Jenkins goes on to write of Brown&#8217;s privatisation of &#8220;public
borrowing&#8221; through Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) and
Public-Private Partnerships. As he points out:</p>

<p class="quoteb">By July 2003 Brown was boasting of the completion of 450
PFI projects, including 34 hospitals, 239 schools, 34 fire and police
stations, 12 prisons and 12 waste projects. The NHS had by 2005
borrowed some &#163;6 billion for PFI schemes, with a further &#163;11
billion in the pipeline. By the mid-2000s virtually all health
investment was being financed by the private sector. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">What Brown had done was to find a way to make government spending
attractive to and profitable for big business. The inevitable end
result will be a public sector, if that is still the right term, that
will be effectively in the hands of capital. The first charge on
revenue will inevitably be payment of the debts incurred by PFI. In
the NHS this makes the introduction of charges a certainty, and one
can predict with considerable confidence an attempt by a Brown
government to introduce such a scheme, limited to begin with, but
preparing the way for later expansion. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p>One other thing that Jenkins points out is New Labour&#8217;s
effective privatisation of civil service functions. Instead of
turning to the civil service for advice, New Labour turns to private
consultants. This is not a small matter. Whereas in 1995 &#163;300
million was spent on consultants by the Conservative government, by
2003 the cost was &#163;1.7 billion and by 2004 &#163;2.5 billion. Indeed,
from 1997 to 2006 New Labour&#8217;s spending on consultants has been
estimated at &#163;70 billion. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p>Why has the Labour Party allowed all this? Well, first of all,
many party members, including lifelong members, have voted with their
feet and resigned in disgust and despair. Those who remain inhabit a
party that is radically different from the Labour Party in 1990, let
alone 1964 or 1945. As Stephen Ingle has pointed out, the new intake
of Labour MPs in 1997 &#8220;contained as many millionaires as it did
manual workers&#8221;. Indeed, he goes on to put New Labour into some
sort of historical perspective: &#8220;The New Labour government is less
representative of organised Labour than was the Liberal Party of
Campbell Bannerman and Asquith.&#8221; <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a>
The Labour left has never been weaker, and it has been completely
unable to seriously hinder, let alone stop, the drive to the right.</p>

<p>What of relations between Brown and Blair? Throughout Blair&#8217;s
period of office one of the most important features of his government
has been the power exercised by the chancellor of the exchequer. To a
considerable extent, Blair was effectively excluded from social and
economic policy making, with Brown famously refusing to even discuss
the budget with him. This unprecedented situation reflected the
strength of Brown&#8217;s position within New Labour, but, for all that,
Brown has never felt strong enough to bring Blair down and at the
same time ensure his own succession. Over the introduction of student
&#8220;top-up fees&#8221;, for example, Brown covertly encouraged backbench
opposition, but in the end backed down. On Blair&#8217;s part, there
seems little doubt that if the Iraq War had been the triumph he
expected it to be, then the overthrow of Saddam Hussein would have
been swiftly followed by the overthrow of Gordon Brown. Far from
strengthening Blair so as to enable him to remove Brown from the
Treasury, the war mortally damaged him. It is the Iraq War that in
the end has made it possible for Brown to take over from Blair.</p>

<p>It is important to recognise, however, that this bitter struggle
within the government has not been over any fundamental policy
differences, between a left and a right within New Labour. Brown and
Blair&#8217;s mutual hatred has been personal rather than political. The
differences between them are more differences of style than of
substance. Brown, for example, does not share Blair&#8217;s relaxed
attitude towards political corruption, something he evidenced as far
back as the Ecclestone affair. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p>But those who believe, against all the evidence, that Brown was
not fully behind the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq are deluding
themselves. One recent New Labourite discussion of a Brown
government&#8217;s likely foreign policy argues that we should &#8220;expect
small but symbolic statements&#8221; distancing themselves &#8220;from
aspects of Bush&#8217;s foreign policy &#8211; Guantanamo, the practice of
extraordinary rendition and US hostility towards the UN&#8221;. Maybe. It
goes on to argue that as far as a US attack on Iran is concerned, &#8220;it
is almost inconceivable that a Brown government would support such
action&#8221;. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a> This is so much wishful
thinking. It shows the extent to which people still have illusions in
Brown. Indeed, it is inconceivable that a Brown government will not
support the attack on Iran when it comes. New Labour and the
Conservative opposition are both married to the United States, for
better and increasingly for worse, and will support US actions,
either overtly or, if it is too politically damaging, covertly. There
is no comfort whatsoever to be taken from developments inside the
Labour Party at the present time. Hope lies outside.</p>

Brown&#8217;s <strong>Maxton</strong> compares favourably, for example, with

his biography of Brown, Tom Bower argues that &#8220;in his head&#8221; Brown
&#8220;understood how Maxton had undermined his ambitions for a better
society by refusing to compromise to obtain power&#8221; (Bower, 2004,

compromise led to MacDonald joining the Conservatives to help save

Kinnock, and William Morris with Hugh Gaitskell. There is, of course,
nothing from Karl Marx or Frederick Engels, both of whom had quite a
lot to say about Britain. Indeed the Marxist tradition is effectively
suppressed. Still, despite every effort to make the collection as
inoffensive as possible, some moments of embarrassment still creep
in. There is an extract from an interview with Dennis Potter where he
lambasts the <strong>Sun</strong> newspaper: &#8220;Just pick up a copy of the <strong>Sun</strong>.
Is this Britain? Is this what we&#8217;ve done to ourselves? How can the
people who work on that paper go home and face their families without
a sense of shame&#8221; (pp.&nbsp;149&#8211;150). This was, of course, before
Blair and Brown had had to abase themselves before Rupert Murdoch,
had both written for the <strong>Sun</strong> and had made it New Labour&#8217;s
favourite newspaper. Indeed, on 1 May 2007, May Day no less, Brown
actually had an article in the <strong>Sun</strong> on <em>Blair&#8217;s decade of
achievement</em>. Here he identified Blair&#8217;s most memorable success
as being &#8220;how we stood shoulder to shoulder with America&#8221; after
9/11. This was not written to reassure <strong>Sun</strong> readers of his
continuing support for the United States, but to reassure Rupert
Murdoch. Dennis Potter, of course, named the cancer that was to
eventually kill him &#8220;Rupert Murdoch&#8221;.</p>

pp.&nbsp;vii, viii. Tony Blair had no interest whatsoever in any of
this laying claim to a Labour heritage, indeed in 2004 he contributed
a chapter to a collection entitled <strong>Neo-Conservatism</strong> (Stelzer,
2004). Other contributors included Margaret Thatcher, Condoleezza
Rice and various luminaries of the US Republican right.</p>

He comforts fellow Blairites with the assurance that while &#8220;Brown&#8217;s
political philosophy is often said to be to the left of that of Tony
Blair &#8211; meaning that he leans more towards the Old Left ... his
speeches and writings over the past few years reveal nothing of the
kind&#8221; (p.&nbsp;35).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f40" name="n40">40.</a> Blair rode into office on a
white charger, without anyone realising it had been given to him in
return for a favour. The character of the man was demonstrated
immediately by the Ecclestone scandal. In return for a &#163;1 million
donation to party funds and the promise of more, the government
exempted Formula One motor racing from the ban on tobacco
advertising. Darts and snooker were not exempted. This was one of the
most blatant acts of political corruption in modern times, carried
out by a man and a government elected on an anti-sleaze ticket. Blair
defended himself by famously arguing that he was &#8220;a pretty straight
sort of guy&#8221;. Brown, to his horror, was caught out on Radio 4&#8217;s
<em>Today</em> programme, having to lie to cover up for Blair. See
Rawnsley, 2001, pp.&nbsp;97&#8211;98.</p>
