<strong>The Blunkett Tapes</strong><br/>
<em>Bloomsbury, 2006, &#163;25</em></p>

<p class="fst">With the publication of his supposed &#8216;diaries&#8217;, David Blunkett
has achieved an impressive hat-trick: the former heads of the
Metropolitan Police, the Prison Service and the Armed Forces have all
publicly called him a liar. This is a remarkable achievement for any
former home secretary, let alone one as right wing as Blunkett.
Indeed nothing like it has ever happened before. While at one level
this obviously reflects on Blunkett&#8217;s honesty, or rather lack of
it, more important is what it tells us about the culture of New
Labour and the state of the Blairite project. First though, what
about Blunkett?</p>

<p>Of particular interest in this regard is the tale that Martin
Narey, the former Director-General of the Prison Service, had to
tell. He was incensed by Blunkett&#8217;s self-aggrandising account of
his performance during the Lincoln prison riot of October 2002. In
his &#8216;diaries&#8217; Blunkett relates how he had to instruct Narey to
stop &#8216;dithering&#8217; and if necessary to call in the army to retake
the prison. He was worried that the rioting might spread throughout
the prison system, that &#8216;we were within a whisker of having on our
hands a total and utter catastrophe&#8217;. Blunkett emphasises that on
this occasion he made a real difference, that his intervention staved
off disaster. He acted decisively to strengthen &#8216;the arm of those
who were prepared to act&#8217; and made it clear that he was &#8216;prepared
to override those who were dithering&#8217;. He modestly concludes that
his performance on this occasion proved that he was one of the &#8216;best&#8217;
of Tony Blair&#8217;s ministers and that he had prevented a &#8216;firestorm&#8217;
engulfing the prisons. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p>Narey tells a somewhat different story. He observes that
Blunkett&#8217;s diary entry &#8216;was clearly not written at the time
because he refers to me as being in overall charge of corrections
(prisons and probation), a position not invented at the time of the
riot and one I was not to take up until 2003&#8217;. He, on the other
hand, was so disturbed by Blunkett&#8217;s behaviour that he did keep
contemporaneous notes. According to these, a hysterical Blunkett
phoned Narey to demand that the prison be retaken, no matter what the
consequences:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;He directed me, without delay, to order staff back
into the prison. I told him that we did not, at that time, have
enough in the prison to contemplate such a move, but that many more
staff were on their way from other prisons. I insisted, however, that
although I was determined to take the prison back as quickly as
possible, I could not, and would not, risk staff or prisoners&#8217;
lives in attempting to do so. He shrieked at me that he didn&#8217;t care
about lives, and told me to call in the army and &#8220;machine-gun&#8221;
the prisoners. He then ordered me to take the prison back
immediately. I refused. One of the prison governors who overheard the
exchanges remarked incredulously, &#8220;Did he really say he didn&#8217;t
care about lives?&#8221;&#8217; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This episode reveals a great deal about New Labour and the state
of the Labour Party. Blunkett was actually urging a prison massacre,
something that shocked his officials, in order, it seems clear, to
protect his political career. He feared that the rioting would spread
to other prisons and that his carefully constructed image as a
hardline reactionary would be destroyed. If this happened, his
popularity with the right wing press would be at an end and his
usefulness to Tony Blair would be over.</p>

<p>It is easy to forget the extent to which it is historically
unprecedented for a Labour Home Secretary to find himself so far to
the right of his prison officials, but then this government has
produced many such surprises. It is a new development for a man of
Blunkett&#8217;s character and reactionary opinions to be a senior figure
in the Labour Party, for such a man, before his (first) resignation
in December 2004, to be seriously considered as Blair&#8217;s possible
successor, and indeed for him to remain a Labour MP at all. Once upon
a time someone like Blunkett would have inevitably defected to the
Conservatives. Clearly the Labour Party is not what it used to be. It
would once have been inconceivable that a member of a Catholic right
wing secret society (Ruth Kelly) could have become Secretary of State
for Education or that the husband of a health minister (Tessa Jowell)
could be regarded as an unfriendly witness by the Italian police in a
case involving the illegal sale of contaminated blood products. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>
Today anything is possible with New Labour. One can only look
forward, at the time of writing, to Blair becoming the first prime
minister ever to be interviewed by the police over the sale of
peerages! All this is really unprecedented, but we have got used to
it. It is testimony to how far the Blairites have pulled the Labour
Party to the right, the extent to which they have corrupted it and
left it rotten to the core.</p>

<p>How has this sorry state of affairs come about? How is it that
David Blunkett, once a young radical Labour councillor in Sheffield,
later the leader of the so-called &#8216;Socialist Republic of South
Yorkshire&#8217;, has ended up a discredited reactionary, a man regarded
as a serious threat to civil liberties, one of the most right wing
members of the New Labour government?</p>

<p>Blunkett, as is well-known, had a very hard childhood. After the
death of his father in a horrendous industrial accident <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> the
family was poverty-stricken and, of course, Blunkett was blind. He
had enormous difficulties to overcome, but nevertheless succeeded,
against considerable odds, in securing a university education and
eventually becoming a Labour councillor, positioning himself on the
left of the party. As Blunkett wrote in his autobiography, <strong>On A
Clear Day</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;I had already learned sufficient history to appreciate
that through the ages there has been a constant struggle not only
between right and wrong, but also between those with power and wealth
and those with neither.&#8217; <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">He marched against the Springboks tour and was on the massive
demonstration against the Industrial Relations Act in 1972. He made
his name, however, as a champion of subsidised public transport. By
1980 he was the leader of Sheffield Council. According to his
biographer, Stephen Pollard, Blunkett always took care to appear more
left wing than he really was. He was, at this time, &#8216;riding the
left horse&#8217; as a career strategy. He was &#8216;a master at playing the
left gallery&#8217;. Pollard quotes one of Blunkett&#8217;s friends on this
left pose:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Take the red flag flying over Sheffield; it was all
gesture politics. It was all to make the left think that he was one
of them. But he did not really believe in it. What he really wanted
was office for himself and for the Labour Party.&#8217; <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">He was far from alone in this adoption of a left pose at this
point in time. The 1980s saw the rise of Bennism inside the Labour
Party, and to secure a parliamentary seat, Blunkett had to establish
his Bennite credentials. Given that his leftism was always
exaggerated, it is worth making the point that at this time even the
right of the Labour Party would have recoiled in horror from the
politics of Blairism, from what would have been seen then as a kind
of ultra-Thatcherism.</p>

<p>What began Blunkett&#8217;s shift to the right was apparently
Thatcher&#8217;s defeat of the municipal left over rate capping and the
defeat of the miners&#8217; strike in 1985. This began his trajectory
from Tony Benn to Tony Blair via Neil Kinnock. What is interesting,
of course, is that the miners&#8217; strike was one of those dramatic
demonstrations of the &#8216;constant struggle between those with wealth
and power and those with neither&#8217;. The conclusions Blunkett drew
from this particular episode in the struggle led to him eventually
changing sides.</p>

<p>Which brings us, at last, to <strong>The Blunkett Tapes</strong> &#8211; surely
one of the biggest publishing disasters of the decade. The
publishers, Bloomsbury, paid &#163;400,000 for this interminable 850-page
exercise in self-justification and self-pity, for a book that is
really without any redeeming features and that contributes nothing
whatsoever to our political or historical understanding of the times
we live in. Despite a massive publicity blitz on radio, television
and in the press, <strong>The Blunkett Tapes</strong> sold only 769 copies in
its first week on the shelves, something that will seriously affect
the size of the advances paid to other Labour ministers for their memoirs.</p>

<p>What does Blunkett actually have to say? He is very much concerned
to establish his own cleverness and decisiveness, to condemn &#8216;human
rights fanatics&#8217;, &#8216;woolly-minded liberals&#8217; and even &#8216;the
Socialist Workers Party and its hangers-on&#8217; and, of course, to sing
the praises of Tony Blair (&#8216;absolutely superb ... a real world
leader&#8217;). Interestingly, he takes every opportunity he can to put
the knife into Roy Hattersley, the former deputy leader of the Labour
Party, who has watched Blunkett effortlessly pass from his left to
his right with ill-disguised distaste. On occasions Blunkett&#8217;s
dislike for asylum seekers comes out. His infamous use of the word
&#8216;swamped&#8217; with regard to asylum seekers seems not so much a
cynical playing of the racist card as something he felt quite
genuinely. His resentment at asylum seekers turning up at his
constituency surgeries is almost visceral, and on one occasion they
were actually accompanied by &#8216;a white woman, a real do-gooder&#8217;.
This is all pretty unsavoury.</p>

<p>One problem with Blunkett&#8217;s diaries concerns their reliability.
Martin Narey, as we have already seen, effectively exposed his
account of the Lincoln prison riot as fictional, and one suspects
that the same is true for much of the rest of the diaries. His
entries regarding the war in Iraq, for example, do not inspire the
slightest confidence. It seems absolutely clear that the diary has
been rewritten in light of the furore over the failure to find
weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>While Blair and Co. never seriously believed that they were going
to find such weapons, they were confident that in the euphoria of
victory such details would be easily forgotten. Blunkett&#8217;s diaries
show every sign of being written in the knowledge that this was not
to be, that the failure to find WMD would come to haunt them, and
that some other pretext for the invasion would be necessary. He
writes that it was his belief that the question of WMD was always
secondary because UN Resolution 1441 provided adequate justification
for attacking Iraq. Britain and the United States were merely
enforcing a UN resolution.</p>

<p>These are just not credible as contemporaneous diary entries.
Similarly, his entry explaining away Clare Short&#8217;s embarrassing
revelations that the government had been listening in on the UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan&#8217;s phone calls: she must have found the
transcripts on a website. This was clearly made up after the event.
Even with regard to his recent boast that during the war he had urged
the bombing of <em>Al Jazeera</em>, one cannot possibly take his word
for it without other confirmation. He might just be trying to
demonstrate his reactionary credentials to the likes of Rupert Murdoch!</p>

<p>What do ring true, however, are his concerns about the impact of
the anti-war movement. &#8216;How do you count a march like the one in
London?&#8217; Blunkett asked himself of the great 15 February 2003
anti-war demonstration. &#8216;This is not going to be an easy time&#8217;,
he observed, with some understatement. &#8216;We have got an uphill
struggle on our hands.&#8217; And when the invasion finally began, he
complained that &#8216;we are getting demos all over the place&#8217;. A year
later he was still writing about &#8216;the backlash on Iraq&#8217;. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p>It is necessary to put Blunkett&#8217;s trajectory from &#8216;soft&#8217;
left to &#8216;hard&#8217; right in context. Labour MPs, even former
ministers, have often completed such a transformation. It is an
established feature of Labour Party history. Indeed one only has to
think of Ramsay MacDonald, the leader of the party for many years and
twice prime minister, defecting to the Conservatives in 1931. An even
more extreme example is provided by Oswald Mosley, a former Labour
junior minister, establishing the British Union of Fascists in 1932.</p>

<p>What is new today is that under Blair the Labour Party as a whole
has defected to the right, not just its leader or individual MPs.
This reflects the shift in the balance of class forces in Britain
that began under Thatcher and has continued under Blair. Big business
and the rich are so powerful today that Labour ministers actually see
themselves as being there to serve their interests, and indeed aspire
to join their ranks. When the Labour Party was first established,
whatever criticisms one might have of its reformism, it was committed
to fight against the injustices and inequalities in British society.
New Labour, however, has enthusiastically embraced them.</p>

<p>A key figure in the transformation of the Labour Party has been
Rupert Murdoch, not just in helping bring it about, but also in
indicating exactly how far the process has gone. It would have been
absolutely unthinkable before Blair for any senior Labour politician
to openly court a union buster and right wing media boss of the
calibre of Murdoch. Even Kinnock drew the line there. Today it is
regarded in Labour ranks as unexceptional, as routine, as an
inevitable part of the contemporary political process. Indeed Lance
Price, a senior Labour spin doctor, has actually described Murdoch as
a <em>de facto</em> member of the cabinet, as one of its most important
members along with Gordon Brown and John Prescott. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> Attempts under
the Freedom of Information Act to find out how often Blair and
Murdoch have communicated predictably failed, the reason being, of
course, that they are so regular as to constitute a scandal. And
there is every expectation that when Blair finally retires from
politics he will be rewarded with an extremely lucrative post at the
top of Murdoch&#8217;s News International. Some cynics would argue that
he has, in fact, been working for Murdoch for years. What the Murdoch
connection does, however, is personalise New Labour&#8217;s intimate
connection with the British capitalist class. It is indicative of the
relationships that Blair and Brown have successfully established with
big business and the rich.</p>

<p>Blunkett himself has benefited from Murdoch&#8217;s generosity. He
found the man &#8216;perfectly decent to deal with &#8211; very reasonable&#8217;.
One has to remind oneself that this is the same man who in 1986
recruited scab labour, sacked his entire workforce and fought a
year-long lockout to break the print unions, one of the bitterest
industrial battles of the period. Murdoch inflicted tremendous
hardship on thousands of workers and their families, and dealt the
whole labour movement a serious blow. This is of no concern at all to
the New Labour leadership. When Blunkett found himself in serious
trouble, with his political career collapsing around him, he wrote in
his diary, &#8216;Thank God the <strong>Sun</strong> is totally with me. At least
one newspaper is trying to tell the truth.&#8217; This verges on the
obscene. And when he finally had to resign from the government for a
second time in November 2005, he immediately went to Wapping for &#8216;a
pleasant drink&#8217; with Murdoch, who offered him a regular column in
the <strong>Sun</strong>. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> He was to be paid &#163;150,000 a year for this. The
man who had first appeared on TV in 1967 to complain about nudity and
who in 1983 walked out of a play in protest against nudity on the
stage apparently has no problem with Page 3.</p>
