<strong>Drawing the Line: The Untold Story of the Animation Unions from Bosko to Bart Simpson</strong><br/>
<em>University of Kentucky Press, 2006, &#163;16.50</em></p>

<p class="fst">On 27 May 1941 one of Walt Disney&#8217;s top animators, Art Babbitt,
the creator of Goofy, was escorted from the studio premises by
company guards, sacked for his union activities. The next day nearly
400 animators, members of the Screen Cartoonists&#8217; Guild, walked out
on strike. The dispute was extremely bitter. On one occasion Art
Babbitt and Walt Disney had to be pulled off each other after a
picket line confrontation. Pickets carried placards showing Pluto
with the slogan &#8216;I&#8217;d rather be a dog than a scab&#8217;. Every
Wednesday the animators at the nearby Warners studio, who had won
union recognition after a six-day lockout earlier that year, marched
to the Disney picket line to show their solidarity. Led by Chuck
Jones, the creator of <em>Roadrunner</em> (beep! beep!), they marched
dressed as French revolutionaries, carrying a banner that read
&#8216;Libert&#233;, fraternit&#233;, closed-shoppit&#233;&#8217;.</p>

<p>Eventually Disney was forced to surrender, and the strikers
returned to work triumphant on 21 September. Pay was more than
doubled. Although Disney was reconciled to recognising the union, he
was never to forgive the strike leaders. Even after Disney was long
dead, when Art Babbitt was invited to lecture at the California
Institute of the Arts in 1974, the Disney Corporation threatened to
withdraw all its funding if the invitation was not withdrawn.</p>

<p>While the Disney strike effectively completed the unionisation of
American animation, it was not the first serious dispute in the
industry. In May 1937 animators at the Fleischer Studio in New York
(they produced the <em>Betty Boop</em> and <em>Popeye</em> cartoons)
had walked out on strike. This was also a bitter conflict. On a
number of occasions the strikers occupied the foyer of the Paramount
cinema in Times Square singing &#8216;I&#8217;m Popeye the union man&#8217;. The
picket line was regularly reinforced by New York dockers. Eventually,
in September, the company surrendered, conceding union recognition, a
20 percent pay rise, a shorter working week, sick pay and paid
holidays. Both the Fleischer and the Disney strikes were part of the
great labour revolt that swept American industry in the late 1930s
into the 1940s. The unions were a power in the land.</p>

<p>In his marvellous book, <strong>Drawing the Line</strong>, Tom Sito tells
the story of the struggle to unionise American animation. Both union
man and animator, Sito recounts his own first uneasy encounter with
trade unionism in the 1970s. When starting work as an animator, he
had swallowed the line that if you had talent you did not need a
union. As he puts it, &#8216;It wasn&#8217;t until after years of being
cheated, laid off, and being assured that I was part of a &#8220;family&#8221;,
then cheated and laid off some more, that I came to understand what
my union was trying to do for me.&#8217; Now he has written a history of
the animation unions and, in the process, has uncovered a &#8216;hidden
history, a people&#8217;s history of animation&#8217;. In fact the book is
more than that. It also provides a witty, passionate, radical
insider&#8217;s view of the American film industry that is indispensable
reading for anyone interested in the cinema.</p>

<p>After chronicling the heroic struggles of the 1930s and 1940s (the
anti-capitalist sentiment of the time is demonstrated, according to
Sito, by the success of the song <em>Don&#8217;t Tell My Mother I Work on
Wall Street, She Thinks I Play the Piano in a Whorehouse</em>), he
explores the grimmer years of McCarthyism and the Hollywood
blacklist. Even the man who wrote the song <em>Somewhere Over the
Rainbow</em> for <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, Yip Harburg, was
blacklisted, an episode, as Sito realises, that is rich in symbolism.
With solidarity banned by the Taft-Hartley Act and the unions on the
defensive, the 28-week 1947 Terrytoons lockout was to end in a
crushing defeat.</p>

<p>Sito examines the impact of television on the industry and the
problem that &#8216;runaway&#8217; production posed by the end of the 1970s.
Studios were exporting work and the unions attempted to stop the
flight of animation jobs. In the Runaway Strike of 1979, they caught
the studios unprepared and won concessions. In 1982 the studios
struck back and inflicted a crushing defeat. Union membership fell
from over 2,000 to 866. The export of work continued. At the time of
the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, Disney was having work on <em>The
Little Mermaid</em> completed in Communist China. Cheap labour
trumped anti-Communism every time.</p>

<p>Sito laments, in particular, the failure of the animation unions
to win residuals (payments for repeat showings, for example on TV).
The Screen Actors Guild had won residuals for its members (after
strike action led and sold out by Ronald Reagan) in 1960, but the
animation unions had never taken the issue seriously enough. The
result is, as Sito points out, that all those whose voices are used
on <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, including backing singers, receive
substantial payments from the huge profits the film continues to
generate. But the men and women who actually drew the cartoon only
received their salaries and bonuses.</p>

<p>Sito identifies the animators&#8217; perception of themselves as
artists as one of the big obstacles to union consciousness. Just as
when he first started work, young animators believe that if you have
talent you don&#8217;t need a union. This is why on <em>The Simpsons</em>,
while every other aspect of production was unionised, the 400
animators did not get a union agreement until 2004, after the cartoon
had been in production for 15 years. Young animators rejected the
union out of loyalty to &#8216;their hip studio director with his earring
and Save the Whale T-shirt&#8217; and did not see the &#8216;old robber
barons pulling the strings&#8217;, the robber baron in this particular
instance being Rupert Murdoch.</p>

<p>The &#8216;computer generated imagery&#8217; (CGI) revolution poses new
opportunities and dangers for the animation unions. Sito himself has
been involved in responding to these. Is CGI live action special
effects or animation? Sito has no doubts himself. As he puts it, &#8216;The
animation labour unions have to grow and diversify or die.&#8217;</p>
