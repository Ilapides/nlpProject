<p class="fst"><strong>The Weimar Republic</strong><br/>
Detlev Peukert<br/>
<em>Penguin &#163;.99</em></p>

<p class="fst">The key question in the history of the Weimar regime in Germany in
the 1920s and early 1930s is: why it was that the ruling class were
prepared, however reluctantly, to work with the Socialist Party (SPD)
in establishing the republic at the end of the First World War, but
had turned decisively against it by the end of the 1920s even to the
extent of embracing the Nazis? &#8216;There is,&#8217; Detlev Peukert writes,
however, &#8216;no clear or simple answer to this question.&#8217; Not true.</p>

<p>In 1918 Germany was gripped by revolution and the ruling class was
weakened and discredited by defeat. All that stood in the way of a
workers&#8217; takeover was the SPD which called for law and order,
opposed the workers&#8217; councils and promised to introduce socialism
peacefully after parliamentary elections had been held. Instead of
trying to fight the Socialists the ruling class entered into a unholy
alliance with them, agreeing to tolerate parliamentary democracy as
long as the SPD guaranteed that there would be no socialist
revolution. This alliance was sealed with the blood of Rosa
Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and the other Communists killed by the
right wing Freikorps early in 1919. It was on this somewhat
unreliable foundation that the Weimar Republic was erected.</p>

<p>By the end of the 1920s the German ruling class decided, first,
that the new alliance was no longer necessary and, second, that it
could no longer be afforded. With the onset of the Great Depression,
German capitalism required wage cuts and welfare cuts on such a scale
that trade unions, the Socialists and the Communists, indeed
parliamentary government itself, had to be smashed. To achieve this
they changed their alliance with the Socialists for an alliance with
the Nazis.</p>

<p>The key to understanding the downfall of the Weimar Republic is
the changing requirements of the German ruling class, the existence
of which Peukert does not even acknowledge. From this point of view
the only way to have effectively broken their power was through
socialist revolution.</p>

<p>But according to Peukert what we are confronted by is &#8216;a crisis
of modernisation&#8217;, &#8216;a failed experiment with modernity&#8217; that
finally falls victim to the totalitarian temptation from both left
and right. This theoretical flourish is really only a thin disguise
for what is a standard liberal account written from the perspective
of how parliamentary democracy could have been saved, rather than
from that of socialist revolution. Indeed, according to Peukert,
socialist revolution in an advanced society like Germany was a
utopian non-starter.</p>

<p>One last point. Most criticism of this period focuses on the
criminal policies of the Communist Party (KPD) that campaigned
against the &#8216;social fascist&#8217; Socialists and ignored the growing
Nazi menace. This is quite right. What must not be forgotten,
however, is the consistent refusal of the SPD to offer any resistance
to the German right in this period. Their cowardly opportunism was
the other side of the KPD&#8217;s ultra-leftism.</p>

<p>The KPD&#8217;s sectarian assault on the Socialists meant that they
could not win SPD supporters over to the need for joint action to
fight the Nazis. This reinforced the Socialists&#8217; passivity. This
was a fatal mistake for which both the German and the European
working class paid the price.</p>
