<p class="fst"><strong>Red Mars</strong><br/>
Kim Stanley Robinson<br/>
<em>Harper Collins &#163;8.99</em></p>

<p class="fst">Science fiction novels generally fall into one of two categories:
&#8216;hard&#8217; and &#8216;soft&#8217;. The first category is generally concerned
to explore what is scientifically possible. It is technology
oriented, features macho characters and attracts right wing writers.</p>

<p>The second category is more concerned with exploring personal
relationships and social orders. Science is of interest only insofar
as it can serve as metaphor. This category attracts the more liberal,
feminist and left wing writers.</p>

<p>Now with <strong>Red Mars</strong> we have a widely acclaimed science
fiction novel that attempts both to remain true to the direction of
scientific knowledge and to explore the nature of the social and
political order.</p>

<p>Even more noteworthy, its author, the American writer Kim Stanley
Robinson, has claimed that part of his intention in writing <strong>Red
Mars</strong> had been to rescue &#8216;the socialist baby from being thrown
out with the Stalinist bathwater&#8217; in the aftermath of the collapse
of the Soviet Union. How successful is he?</p>

<p><strong>Red Mars</strong> is volume one of a projected trilogy. It tells of
the first settlement on Mars, of the first stages of the terraforming
process that is to make the planet habitable, of the increasingly
ruthless exploitation of the planet&#8217;s resources by the great Earth
Multinationals and of the eventual revolution of 2062 that this
provokes. The revolution ends in defeat with the surviving
revolutionaries driven underground.</p>

<p>In a whole number of ways, the novel is superb. Robinson&#8217;s Mars
is marvellously realised: the sheer scale and grandeur of the new
planet captures the imagination. His exploration of the politics of
the settlement, of the various factions that form among the
colonists, is also a success. There are those who only reluctantly
come to embrace the cause of independence, who take up a position
clearly modelled on that of the American colonies in the 1770s. They
want an independent Mars, but one going down the same road as the
Earth. More radical factions, however, want not just independence but
a new social order, one where profit does not rule.</p>

<p>The radicals consist of two main factions: the reds led by Arkady
Bogdanov and the greens led by Hiroko Ai. They both share a
libertarian socialist perspective.</p>

<p>Less successful is Robinson&#8217;s handling of personal relations. He
never really manages to rise above the level of a rather melodramatic
soap opera.</p>

<p>Nevertheless <strong>Red Mars</strong> is essential reading for anyone who
enjoys science fiction. It is another demonstration that socialist
ideas were not extinguished with the collapse of Stalinism and that
the struggle goes on.</p>
