<p class="fst"><strong>The Revolution of 1905 in Odessa</strong><br/>
Robert Weinberg<br/>
<em>Indiana University Press Â£25.00</em></p>

<p class="fst">In 1905 Odessa was Russia&#8217;s largest port and fourth largest city
&#8211;a commercial, trading and manufacturing centre with a population
of some 500,000 people. Over a quarter of the city&#8217;s inhabitants
were Jews, the great majority of them working class, many casual
labourers living in great poverty. About half of the city&#8217;s dockers
were Jews.</p>

<p>Socialist activity had begun in Odessa in the mid-1880s but the
various socialist organisations &#8211; Bolshevik, Menshevik and the
Jewish Bund &#8211; all had difficulty rooting themselves in the working
class. The labour movement in the city was dominated by the 25,000
engineering workers. Unrest and discontent were widespread but none
of the socialist organisations was strong enough to give a decisive lead.</p>

<p>The Bloody Sunday massacre in St Petersburg on 9 January 1905
precipitated strikes and street clashes throughout much of Russia but
not in Odessa. Here there was no spontaneous eruption, but instead a
gradual build up of anger and militancy.</p>

<p>Growing numbers of workers became involved in strikes on economic
issues, but it was to be the authorities&#8217; refusal to allow a
general assembly of the city&#8217;s workers, what would in effect have
been a soviet, that became the issue around which the working class united.</p>

<p>By May, the city was in the grip of a strike wave that saw many
workers walking out without even making any demands. The authorities
at last resorted to repression. On 8 June worker representatives were
invited to discuss the situation with the authorities and were
promptly imprisoned. The next few days saw more arrests. Then on 13
June troops opened fire on a mass picket outside the Henn engineering
factory, one of the best organised and most militant in the city.
Dozens of workers were killed or wounded.</p>

<p>This shooting provoked an explosion of anger. Thousands of workers
took to the streets and large crowds, sometimes 2,000 strong, fought
with the police and occupied the municipal gas and electricity
stations. By the next day barricades had been erected throughout
working class districts and the police had been driven off the
streets. This outbreak took the socialists, including the Bolsheviks,
by surprise.</p>

<p>On 15 June the battleship <em>Potemkin</em> arrived in the port.
Mutineers had taken over the vessel. Huge crowds of workers assembled
on the docks to welcome them. The scene was set for a successful
revolutionary attempt. The sailors could have provided armed backing
for a workers&#8217; takeover of the city. But it was not to be. There
was no political leadership to bring workers and sailors together.
Instead it was the army that acted. As evening approached, troops
cordoned off the docks and then opened fire on the crowds. Much of
the dock area was set on fire and in the confusion perhaps as many as
1,000 people were either burned or shot to death. This horrific
massacre broke the movement for the time being. The city was occupied
by 20,000 troops and the <em>Potemkin</em> sailed for asylum in Romania.</p>

<p>But while the workers&#8217; movement had been defeated, it had not
been destroyed. In early October Russia was once against gripped by a
strike wave that reached Odessa. The city was paralysed by a general strike.</p>

<p>The authorities tried a new tactic. Right wing agitators, many of
them policemen, set about stirring up anti-Semitism, exploiting the
tensions caused by the competition for work between Russian and
Jewish casual labourers.</p>

<p>On 18 October large crowds, often led by police and soldiers,
carried out a savage pogrom that was to last for five days.</p>

<p>Even this disaster did not destroy the Odessa workers&#8217; movement.
Indeed, the pogrom stirred the socialists to greater efforts so as to
prevent its recurrence. At the end of November a soviet was
established and an uneasy situation of dual power prevailed in the
city. The soviet campaigned against any fresh attempt at unleashing a pogrom.</p>

<p>In early December the Tsarist regime began its final crackdown on
the revolutionary movement. On 7 December a general strike was called
in Moscow and quickly spread throughout the empire. The Odessa soviet
called a general strike, effectively closing the city down. Following
the armed suppression of the Moscow workers, on 18 December the
Odessa soviet called the strike off. The movement was in retreat.
Early in January 1906 the soviet was banned and its leaders were arrested.</p>

<p>Weinberg has provided an outstanding account of events in Odessa,
an account that gets right down to street and factory gate level. He
has written a tremendous history of class struggle in a multi-ethnic
city where the authorities made full use of both force and racism in
their attempts to defeat the workers&#8217; movement.</p>

<p>The only weakness is in his discussion of the role of the various
socialist parties. He celebrates working class spontaneity but does
not recognise the role that socialist politics could have played in
avoiding the June defeat and the October pogrom. Nevertheless a
superb book.</p>
