<p class="fst">Stephen G. Rabe<br/>
<b>US Intervention in British Guiana: A Cold War Story</b><br/>
<i>University of North Carolina Press, 2005, &#163;14.50</i></p>

<p class="fst">In the early 1960s both Conservative and Labour governments in
Britain were complicit in CIA efforts to destabilise the elected
government in the South American colony of British Guiana. This CIA
campaign culminated with a constitutional coup, planned by the
Conservatives and implemented by Labour, a coup that removed Cheddi
Jagan and the People&#8217;s Progressive Party (PPP) from power and
installed the United States&#8217; candidate, Forbes Burnham, a man known
to be a corrupt racist and a gangster. At US insistence the newly
independent Guyana was handed over by Harold Wilson&#8217;s Labour
government to the tender mercies of Forbes Burnham in May 1966. His
gangster regime oppressed and pillaged the country, turning it into
&#8216;an economic facsimile of Haiti&#8217;, into the 1990s. This sorry tale
is the subject of Stephen Rabe&#8217;s exemplary study, <b>US
Intervention In British Guiana</b>, a book that reveals that neither
British subordination to the United States nor British complicity in
the crimes of the CIA is anything new.</p>

<p>The instigator of Cheddi Jagan&#8217;s downfall was President Jack
Kennedy, a man obsessed with the threat that the left posed to US
domination over South America. He fervently believed that Jagan was a
stalking horse for Fidel Castro and that consequently he had to be
overthrown, no matter what. Although Jagan had been regarded by the
British as dangerously left wing in the early 1950s, by the closing
years of the decade he was acknowledged as a moderate reformist who
posed no threat to British interests. Where Jagan fell foul of the
Americans was in his adoption of a neutralist stance with regard to
the Cold War, in his refusal to commit himself to the US side. This
was completely unacceptable to Kennedy. Indeed, in April 1960 Jagan
actually had the temerity to visit Cuba as Castro&#8217;s guest,
soliciting economic aid. The fact that he was also seeking economic
aid from the US was neither here nor there as far as the Americans
were concerned. Neutralism was grounds for overthrow. As Rabe points out:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;In the name of anti-Communism, the Kennedy
administration took extraordinary measures to deny the people of
British Guiana the right to self-determination. US officials and
private citizens incited murder, arson, bombings and fear and
loathing in British Guiana. Indeed, the covert US intervention
ignited racial warfare between blacks and Indians. By the end of
1962, the United States had forced the United Kingdom to accede to
its demands to find a way to deny power to Cheddi Jagan.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">The British initially tried to persuade the Americans that the PPP
was not a danger. On one occasion the British colonial secretary,
Iain Macleod, told Dean Rusk, the US Secretary of State, that not
only was Jagan not a threat to the West, but that if he had to live
in British Guiana, he would certainly prefer to have Jagan in power
rather than Forbes Burnham. The Americans, however, produced a stream
of fake, manufactured intelligence identifying Jagan as a communist,
none of which proved to have any substance. In February 1962 the
British were informed that a Cuban freighter was smuggling 50 tons of
weapons into the country to arm Jagan&#8217;s supporters. When the ship
was searched, it was found to be carrying second-hand printing
equipment. The CIA has apparently always had trouble finding weapons!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the British government stood by while the CIA,
working through the US trade union bureaucracy, the AFL-CIO
apparatus, poured money and agents into the colony. They suborned
corrupt elements within the local trade union movement and financed
Jagan&#8217;s rivals. Every effort was made to build up Forbes Burnham&#8217;s
People&#8217;s National Congress (PNC) and to exploit divisions between
black and indian workers. Whereas Jagan&#8217;s PPP did its best to unite
the working class (in the 1961 general election 12 of the PPP&#8217;s 26
candidates were black), Forbes Burnham whipped up race hatred and
communal violence. This was, and remains, a classic CIA strategy. The
result was serious rioting in the capital, Georgetown, in February
1962, intended to stop the British declaring the colony independent
with Jagan in power.</p>

<p>The Macmillan government in London capitulated to American
pressure. Only days after the outbreak of the CIA sponsored rioting
Dean Rusk told the British that &#8216;it is not possible for us to put
up with an independent British Guiana under Jagan&#8217;. He warned of
&#8216;strains on Anglo-American relations&#8217;. In response to what was,
in effect, an ultimatum, the British came up with a strategy to
remove Jagan, hopefully without showing their hand openly.
Independence was postponed and in October 1962 the British announced
that they were introducing a system of proportional representation
that would allow the removal of the PPP from power without the
appearance of a coup having taken place. With US support and
financial backing, Jagan&#8217;s opponents would be bought together under
Forbes Burnham&#8217;s leadership and hopefully secure a majority.
Meanwhile, CIA efforts at destabilisation, with British connivance,
were stepped up. Prime minister Macmillan actually met CIA director
John McCone to discuss the situation in British Guiana &#8211; an
unprecedented step.</p>

<p>The CIA campaign culminated in a general strike against the Jagan
government that lasted from 18 April until 8 July 1963. It was
accompanied by considerable violence, including bombings and
shootings, with Forbes Burnham&#8217;s supporters once again whipping up
race hatred. The CIA financed the strike to the tune of $1 million,
in the hope of plunging the colony into disorder on such a scale that
the British would have to remove Jagan and take over. Indeed, Kennedy
urged Macmillan to use the strike as a pretext to intervene, but the
British refused. The disagreement was only over timing, however.
American hostility to Jagan was such that Kennedy actually warned
Macmillan that if independence was granted with the PPP still in
power this would provoke a US attack on Cuba. Indeed, in February
1964 the United States actually prepared their own plans for direct
military intervention in the colony to remove Jagan. Their pressure
secured the removal of the colony&#8217;s governor, Sir Ralph Grey, who
was openly sceptical of US fears, opposed the proportional
representation ploy and considered Forbes Burnham to be unstable.</p>

<p>The election of Harold Wilson&#8217;s Labour Party into government in
London in October 1964 gave heart to the embattled Jagan. In
opposition, Wilson had condemned the Conservatives&#8217; constitutional
coup, and Jagan hoped that the Labour government would come to his
aid. While Wilson undoubtedly had some sympathy for Jagan (they were
after all both reformists), the bottom line was that relations with
the United States came first. Jagan was given the brush-off and
Wilson went ahead and implemented the Conservative plan. In December
1964 a general election was held in British Guiana under proportional
representation, accompanied by violence, intimidation and electoral
fraud. Jagan&#8217;s opponents were generously funded by the CIA, and the
threat of US intervention was always in the background. Even so, the
PPP increased its share of the popular vote, but not by enough. Under
the new electoral system, the PPP won only 24 of the 53 seats. Forbes
Burnham was appointed prime minister. Harold Wilson&#8217;s Labour
government presided over the installation in power of a corrupt
gangster regime that was to oppress and pillage the Guyanese people
for the next 25 years.</p>

<p>Learning from history is easy when so little changes. Today US
attempts to destabilise and overthrow the Chavez government in
Venezuela have the full support of Tony Blair&#8217;s New Labour
government. There are differences, however. Whereas Wilson bowed down
to the Americans reluctantly and with some regret in 1964, Blair and
Co. are unreservedly on side.</p>
