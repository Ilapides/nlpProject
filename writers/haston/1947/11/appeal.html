<p class="fst">Comrade and Fellow Worker,</p>

<p>As you are aware, the workers at the <em>Savoy</em> and its associated hotels, <em>Claridges</em>, the <em>Berkeley</em> and <em>Simpsons</em> have been in conflict with the management since last October 1946, when the great strike of catering workers took place. For the past months a struggle has been going on with the management over the alleged victimisation of a waiter shop-steward, Frank Piazza, and the workers came out on strike again on November 7th for trade union principles.</p>

<p>T he &ldquo;<strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>&rdquo; stated the case for the workers as reported by Trade Unionists and Trade Union officials in an article written by an active trade union militant employed at the Savoy &ndash; Marion Lunt &ndash; who has since been sacked on alleged grounds of redundancy.</p>

<p>As a result of that article, the Savoy bosses have entered a libel action against the <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong> claiming damages. The Savoy Hotel Ltd., the most powerful of the London catering employers, has secured an injunction against the <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong> which effectively silences us from commenting on the background of the workers' struggle until the case is heard in the High Court.</p>

<p>The <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong> has a proud record in speaking for the interests of the workers whenever they have fought the capitalist class. This is a clear case of Big Business versus the voice of militant Labour.</p>

<p>A case of this kind is very expensive and we rely upon the support of class conscious trade unionists to fight it to the end. We ask you to raise the matter in your Trade</p>

<p>Union Branch with a view to sending a donation to the Fund, and to get the maximum financial contributions from your members on a subscription list. All funds for this purpose should be sent to: SAVOY CASE, 256, Harrow Road, London, W.2.</p>
