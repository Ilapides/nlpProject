<p class="fst">The news that British troops are being used in Java and Indo-China against the nationalist movement is a matter of grave concern for the working class and the socialist movement in this country. The reports in the <strong>Daily Herald</strong> go to show that the British military authorities are openly collaborating with the Japanese authorities in putting down the revolution of the popular masses.</p>

<p>The true interests of the British working class demand that we support the Indonesian peoples in their struggle against Dutch and French imperialism. The policy of your government, in intervening on the side of the oppressors is entirely contrary to the interests of the working class. It serves to discredit the Labor Government in the eyes of the oppressed peoples of the world. Such a policy can only succeed in creating a gulf of mistrust and a wall of hostility between the mass of the oppressed colonial people and the working class movement of this country.</p>

<p>We believe that the overwhelming majority of the workers and middle class people who voted Labor into power, oppose the reactionary imperialist policy now being pursued by your government and we are voicing the desire of all class conscious workers in demanding that immediate steps be taken by your government to stop this imperialist intervention, to withdraw all British troops from Indonesia and thus allow the native peoples to freely choose their own form of government.</p>
