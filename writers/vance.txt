AMERICAN CAPITALISM ACHIEVED NEW PEAKS in production, employment and income during 1955. As the January 1956 Monthly Letter of the First National City Bank puts it: “The nation has ended its busiest and most prosperous year with the indexes of over-all business activity at the highest of the year. Latest figures on production, non-farm employment, consumption, income, and investment, indicate that the trend is still upward.”
The New York Times’ financial editor, John G. Forrest, in the annual review of the nation’s business, on January 3, 1956, stated: “Boom all the way. That was 1955 for United States industry.” Mr. Forrest summarizes the performances of 1955 by stating:
“When the tally is struck for 1955, it probably will show a gross national product of around $387 billion. That would be 7 per cent above 1954’s total and 6 per cent above 1953’s, the previous peak.”
No matter what measure is taken, whether it be the Federal Reserve index of production or just such a simple index as the output of steel, or any other likely measure, there is no doubt that 1955 was the number one year so far as production is concerned in the history of American capitalism.
This remarkable performance of the American economy, which to a certain extent is paralleled by the rest of the capitalist economy throughout the world, has persuaded some bold apologists for the bourgeoisie and some ex-socialists to reach the conclusion that there is no longer any class struggle in the United States; that depressions arc a thing of the past and that through some miraculous process (not quite clearly understood or explained by anyone) the millennium has arrived. There is no longer any need to advocate socialism because American capitalism, under the Eisenhower Administration, has produced a land of plenty and permanent prosperity. Some even go so far as to refer to this new utopian state of affairs as the “land of permanent peace and prosperity.”
The process by which The Permanent War Economy becomes “permanent peace and prosperity” is a triumph for the semantic arts. The question remains, however, to what extent, if any, has capitalism under The immanent War Economy eliminated the business cycle, or, if you prefer, eliminated severe depressions?
The interest in the subject is such that the Chamber of Commerce of the United States has devoted an entire pamphlet to the subject, entitled, Can We Depression-Proof Our Economy? This pamphlet refers to the adjustments and increases in production that have taken place since the end of World War II, and to the fact that there are “Numerous automatic built-in stabilizers or cushions which we did not have in 1929.”
“All these factors,” the pamphlet concludes, “have lead some students to believe that we are more or less depression-proof; or at least, that serious general depressions are less likely to occur than formerly.” The question is then raised: “Is this optimism justified? Or, have we merely been the beneficiaries of exceptionally favorable postwar factors?”
The United States Chamber of Commerce then proceeds to review the “evidence.” A Prentice-Hall release is cited in which it is stated that: “It is becoming crystal clear that serious depressions have been abolished in the United States by popular vote.” (Sic!)
It is pointed out that the 1953–1954 recession was unusually mild and the fact that it did not degenerate into a full-fledged depression is most heartening and perhaps warrants the belief that there are some new factors on the scene in the form of these “built-in stabilizers,” and while no categorical statement is made, the presumption is that perhaps, at the very least, severe depressions are a thing of the past.
On the other hand, the Chamber of Commerce proceeds to point out to those that arc unduly complacent that they should take heed from the warning issued by J.K. Galbraith published in Harper’s magazine, October 1954, to the effect that “important people begin to explain that it cannot happen because conditions are fundamentally sound.” From which Mr. Galbraith draws the conclusion that that is precisely the time to worry because another collapse, comparable to 1929, in his opinion, is definitely possible. The Chamber of Commerce, moreover, does not lose sight of the political importance of the subject. It points out that “if we attain this target [sustained prosperity], other domestic problems will remain manageable. For international reasons as well, the attainment of this goal is important. It will refute the Marxists’ criticisms of private capitalism both here and abroad.” The question of the so-called new perspective and economic outlook, that is, permanent prosperity, has engaged the President’s Council of Economic Advisers. In their 1955 economic report to the President, they review the experiences of the 1953–54 recession and draw the following lessons (quoted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce):
First, that wise and early action by government can stave off serious difficulties later;
Second, that contraction may be stopped in its tracks, even when governmental expenditures and budget deficits are declining, provided effective means are taken for building confidence;
Third, that monetary policy can be a powerful instrument of economic recovery, so long as the confidence of consumers and businessmen in the future remains high;
Fourth, that automatic stabilizers, such as unemployment insurance and a tax system that is elastic with respect to the national income, can be of material aid in moderating cyclical fluctuations;
Fifth, that a minor contraction in this country need not produce a severe depression abroad;
Sixth, that an expanding world economy can facilitate our own readjustments.
Lest the apostles of the new religion of “permanent peace and prosperity under capitalism” jump to the conclusion that they have a real ally in the United States Chamber of Commerce, let us point out that immediately after the analysis presented above and the quotation from the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, the United States Chamber of Commerce states: “It would be difficult to find a single economist who believes, as some did in the late 1920s, that we are, indeed, depression-proof.” If the United States Chamber of Commerce is not ready to take the plunge into the new camp of “permanent peace and prosperity under capitalism,” there are others who are not quite so cautious. And that is pretty much the position of Sumner H. Slichter which he has expressed in various articles, including one published in the Atlantic Monthly for May 1955 entitled, Have We Conquered The Business Cycle?
While Slichter likes to leave himself an “out,” he is also fond of making headlines. For example, in a recent article of The New York Times Magazine section of December 4, 1955, dealing with the relationship of our economy to politics, Slichter states:
“A severe depression would undoubtedly sharpen the differences between the parties in the United States and would accentuate the influence of the left-wingers in the Democratic Party, but the days when this country can experience anything worse than moderate or possibly mild depressions are gone forever.” (My italics – T.N.V.)
 
WHAT ARE SOME OF THESE “BUILT-IN stabilizers” that are supposed to have eliminated severe depressions and achieved a more or less permanent modification in the business cycle? They are summarized by the United States Chamber of Commerce in the aforementioned pamphlet as follows:
(1) The quick offsetting reactions which occur in our tax structure, with the heavy reliance on the income tax; (2) Stability and size of the government expenditures; (3) The farm price support program; (4) Unemployment compensation; (5) The numerous private and public pension programs; (6) The Federal Deposit Insurance System; (7) The self-amortizing nature of most private debt; and (8) The volume of liquid assets held by individuals and businesses.
To the extent that these factors mean anything – and they do mean something that is very important – what is being said here is that capitalism under The Permanent War Economy has achieved a life of more or less permanent government intervention and that this government intervention has modified the business cycle.
Certainly the government’s Council of Economic Advisers takes credit for the fact that serious economic fluctuation or depression has been avoided in the past few years. Its chairman, Dr. Arthur F. Burns, puts it this way:
These are the basic premises that have controlled our business cycle policy in the recent past. If governmental policy in the months and years ahead continues to adhere to these premises, if government steadily maintains a watchful eye on the state of business and consumer sentiment and if it gives heed to the need of avoiding inflation as well as depression; we may, I think, be reasonably confident that – although we are likely to continue to have fluctuations in individual markets, to some degree even in the economy as a whole – we will avoid in the future the business depressions that have marred our brilliant record of free enterprise in the past.
This would seem to put the Council of Economic Advisers, an official government body, almost in the camp of Sumner Slichter.
The United States Chamber of Commerce concludes its pamphlet on this question as follows:
Are we, then, depression-proof? Prolonged and deep depressions are avoidable and will not occur again, unless we take complete leave of our wits – which could be. Minor fluctuations and rolling adjustments in industry after industry are inevitable. While having unfortunate aspects, they nevertheless perform a useful and essential function. Individual companies will face changing fortunes. Crises in international affairs can be upsetting. Domestic political uncertainties, threats of undue business regulation or taxation – these and many other factors could undo the promising developments in the field of stabilization. Stability has to be earned. (Italics in original only in the last sentence. – T.N.V.)
Is this a new era or is it not? On the one hand, severe depressions are avoidable and will not occur, that is, “unless we take complete leave of our wits,” but apparently it is possible, according to the United States Chamber of Commerce, that we may take complete leave of our wits. And one suspects that taking complete leave of our wits has reference to such measures as increasing the minimum wage law, etc.
Let us not be completely disheartened because later on in its conclusion the Chamber of Commerce makes the fairly bold statement: “If we have the courage to avoid excessive booms and the wit to use what we know, there is reason to believe that future instability can be kept within fairly tolerable limits.” (Sic!) In other words, if we can avoid depressions there will be no depressions. But how do we know we can avoid depressions?
Lest anyone accuse the United States Chamber of Commerce of a definitive statement on a subject of this kind, we must quote the very last sentence in their brochure: “And, since the future can never be foreseen with certainty, it is always wise to watch out for surprises.”
Lest there be any possible misunderstanding on this question, let us make it perfectly clear. If capitalism can succeed in eliminating the business cycle, i.e., in achieving permanent peace and prosperity, then not only has the class struggle been so transformed as to be unrecognizable but clearly there will be no need for a socialist form of society to organize the productive forces for capitalism will have guaranteed their permanent increase. The question, therefore, is of great theoretical and practical importance.
If the performance of the economy in 1955 was at record levels, the outlook for 1956 is clearly relevant. Will this boom keep rolling on and on and on, so that memories of depressions fade into the dim and distant past and pretty soon there will be no living inhabitants who recall the depression of the ’30s or the rather severe recession of ‘47 and ’48 or even the mild recession of ’53–’54?
The United States Chamber of Commerce is extremely bullish in its outlook for 1956. The forecast by its chief economist, Emerson P. Schmidt, states:
“The expansion which began in the summer of 1954 carried through 1955. The high Christmas sales will start 1956 off with good levels of employment, production and general economic activity. The year 1956 may well be our best year in history.” (My italics – T.N.V.)
There is no hedging here – “the year 1956 may well be our best year in history.” Of course, there is the qualifier “may,” but on the other hand the implication is that it should certainly be the best year in history.
Mr. Schmidt is a brave man and he has made these statements in a publication of the United States Chamber of Commerce, entitled Nation’s Business, which receives rather wide circulation. He states:
“To see unmistakably into the future, of course, is not given to man. Surprises – pleasant and unpleasant – are likely. But, in so far as it is possible to weigh and assess recent trends, optimism for next year is justified.”
The same issue of Nation’s Business (December 1955) contains an article by businessman Henry Ford II on the same subject, Outlook for ’56. Mr. Ford, in answer to the query, How does business look to you in 1956? states:
We are very optimistic. I think that it is a little early to tell about the whole year. Certainly the first half ought to be pretty good, but we have an election year coming up. People get preoccupied with candidates and issues in an election year and when feelings run high business has a tendency to run low. As a result 1956 might not be quite as big as this year – but I think it ought to be a good year. (My italics – T.N.V.)
“1956 will be a very prosperous year, but perhaps not quite as good as 1955.” It is possible that businessman Henry Ford II’s outlook is colored by the fact that his firm produces automobiles. In answer to the question, How about the automobile business?, Mr. Ford states:
The automobile business will have a fine year, too. My personal feeling is that it won’t be as big as 1955. How big the reduction is going to be is anybody’s guess. If we assume a 10 per cent reduction, we will still have our second biggest year. Ten per cent of what do you want to say, 7,600,000? That would still be the second biggest year after 1955.
 
WE SHALL RETURN TO THE OUTLOOK for the automobile industry. Meanwhile, let us consider a few more general statements on the business outlook for 1956. The confidential Babson’s Reports issued early in November on the 1956 forecast for stocks and bonds shows a rather sharp disagreement with the extremely bullish statements that have emanated from most sources. States Babson: “For the year ahead we are forecasting that the Babson chart index of the physical volume of business will average around 150 – some five per cent below the record 1955 mark.” Babson amplifies its general prediction by stating: “We look for a decline in general business during the first half of the year which is likely to be somewhat more vigorous than the recovery which we anticipate will set in during the last half of the year.”
The Babson forecast is unique in that all those who are cautious about ’56 other than Babson, state that the boom will continue to roll during the first half of the year and if there is a decline it will be in the second half. Babson, however, predicates its reverse forecast on the fact that it expects a decline in the automobile industry and that this decline will be concentrated in the first half of the year but in the second half of the year when 1957 models will be introduced very early, there will be a sharp increase. Babson also expects a sharp decline (about 15 per cent) in the home building industry in 1956. He feels that when this trend is apparent the government will then step in and take steps to revive building. There is a logical analysis here; whether it will prove to be accurate, of course, remains to be seen. The important point, however, is that here is a very reputable bourgeois outfit (whose reputation for accurate forecasting in the past is unusually good) that does not feel that the boom continues to roll on and on, but that 1955 was the peak. This, of course has important implications for the general question under analysis.
Of equal interest with the Babson forecast is that of Fortune Magazine according to its own blurb, “the ne plus ultra of business publications.” Fortune’s own summary of its 1956 economic forecast contained in its January 1956 issue under the Business Roundup is to the effect that:
“1956 may be a little rough on a number of businesses. This, despite the fact that it starts out as the best year yet: in ’56 the Gross National Product rate will edge up to around $403 billion from ’55’s sensational year-end rate of nearly $400 billion. But there will be a slight down-turn about midyear.”
More interesting is Fortune’s forecast by major industries:
If you’re in any branch of capital goods – machinery, plant, equipment – things look good. But home goods are slowing, steel will go down by midyear, home building starts will be off 100,000 units or so, car buying by a million or more. All consumer businesses are up against the competition of $35 billion in consumer debt repayments during ’56, up $4 billion from ’55. And unemployment could rise to over four million, since two million jobs will be cut out by increased productivity, and some 700,000 new workers will join the labor force ...” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Most business men are optimistic about 1956. Retailers particularly reflect the results of a study made in October by the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan which indicated that 71 per cent of all people expect good times to continue at least through the first eight months of 1956.
At the recent meetings of the American Economics Association there was much discussion about this question, and it was noteworthy that there is now some hedging about the continuation of the business boom. As The New York Times in Mr. Forrest’s column of January 1 puts it:
“Some economists last week differed on the 1956 business picture, with several leaning to the theory that the boom would reach its peak early in the year and that caution should be the watchword after that.”
The only really discordant note was struck by Dr. Edwin G. Nourse, former chairman of President Truman’s Council of Economic Advisers. Dr. Nourse predicted (according to the same article in The New York Times): “We should contemplate a drop of 15 or even 20 per cent in business during 1956.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.) A drop of this magnitude would mean a decline of $60 to $70 billion in gross national product and a catastrophic increase in unemployment. Here we would have not just a mild depression, but from every point of view a rather severe one.
There can be no doubt that Nourse was expressing what might well be termed “the Democratic point of view” on the business outlook. As a matter of record, this view was expressed by the supplemental views of the Democrats on the Joint Committee on the Economic Report in connection with the January 1955 Economic Report of the President. (Report No. 60, 84th Congress, First Session). This supplemental report showed that while they agreed that recovery had taken place from the trough of the 1953–54 recession, we were not really out of the woods, and that there was great danger that developments in the automobile industry and related industries such as construction could cause a downturn of fairly sizable proportions.
To quote the Democratic members (Senators Douglas, Sparkman and O’Mahoney and Representatives Patman, Bolling, Mills and Kelley):
Because the president’s confident expectations for the coming year are centered on a shift of inventory policy from liquidation to accumulation, on the recovery in automobile production, and on rising expenditure for new construction, it is necessary to examine carefully these areas. These may not be sustained throughout the year. A sharp cut-back in automobile production in the last half of the year would have pervasive effects in the steel, coal, textile, and accessory parts industries. Some analysts expressed uneasiness whether the recent rise in construction will persist. If, however, the automobile or construction industries should encounter heavy weather in the last half of the year, and if other segments of the economy do not recover sufficiently to offset them, it would be a matter of prudent and judicious action to fly the storm warnings. Economic declines are like landslides – it takes less to stop them early than after they gain momentum.
The record shows that the Republicans were better forecasters in ’55 than 1956, but the Democrats have held to their basic analysis. What they are doing (and Nourse is clearly one of their most influential spokesmen) is to project into 1956 the forecast they had made for the later part of 1955.
What does Nourse base his views on? Actually, he is basing himself on a better understanding of the long-run and traditional functionings of capitalism than many of our new apostles of the virtues of “free private enterprise.” Nourse has devoted some study apparently to some of the fundamental trends at work, particularly in relation to automation and increasing productivity. His testimony on October 28 before the Subcommittee on Automation of the Joint Committee on the Economic Report received a proper headline in The New York Times of October 29, 1955, namely: Economist Fears Overproduction.
Dr. Nourse’s testimony is worth study. He states:
The real change came when we passed from this kind of continuous process mechanization to that in which electronic devices make it possible to dispense to considerable extent with the mental element in manual control and to use the feedback principle extensively. Under this principle electronic mechanisms make it possible to conduct more elaborate, more economical, and more precise continuous productive operations because the outcome of the process controls the process itself, starting, altering, or stopping it so as to make it produce a desired result. This should dispose of the cliche that automation is nothing new – just more mechanization. It has its roots in mechanization, to be sure, but something new was added when electronic devices made possible the widespread application of the feedback principle ...
The issue which automation now raises is this: Will it alter present economic relations in such ways as to disturb these favorable conditions, or will our business system be able to translate these technological improvements fully and properly into still greater general prosperity and higher standards of living? It is evident it will change wage income both by numbers of jobs, some places up and some places down, and by wage rates upgraded here and downgraded there. It will obsolete some capital equipment and make important demands for new capital equipment. It will affect unit costs for some products, but not all; prices in some markets, not in others; profits and dividends, tax yields, and public spending ...
In contrast to the preponderant attitude of business executives, labor union officials have been outspokenly concerned about the economic impact of automation on the well-being of the mass of worker-consumers in the years immediately ahead ... “But we believe that much study is needed by all parties if the gains are to be made as large and as steady as possible and the temporary dislocations and local burdens or losses made as small as possible and most equitably shared.” With this view I find myself in accord rather than with the idea that the problem will take care of itself or be disposed of automatically by the invisible hand of free enterprise ...
When businessmen or others say that technological progress is good per se and that it takes care of its own economic process, they invoke a simple logic of the free enterprise economy. The entrepreneur seeks profit by adopting a device for raising efficiency. This lowers cost. Price falls proportionately and thus broadens the market. This restores the number of jobs or even increases them and raises the level of living or real incomes. This comfortable formula presupposes a state of complete and perfect competition in a quite simple economic environment with great mobility of labor, both geographical and occupational. But these are not the conditions of today’s industrial society, with large corporations and administered prices; with large unions and complicated term contracts covering wages, working conditions, and “security”; with complex tax structures, credit systems, and extensive government employment and procurement. The smooth and beneficent assimilation of sharp and rapid technological change has to be effectuated through intelligent and even generous policies painstakingly arrived at by administrative agencies, private and public ... (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Against the complacent picture presented by some witnesses at these hearings let us put the actual sequence of economic developments in postwar United States. Technology (with infant but growing automation) has been put to full use under conditions of extraordinarily high and sustained demand, public and private. Labor, viewing this unparalleled rise in productivity, has sought to capture the largest possible share in the form of successive rounds of widespread wage increases in basic rates, escalation formulas, and fringe benefits. As the unit cost of labor went up, management sought to maintain or improve its earning position by raising prices and/or by introducing labor-saving machines and administration. The first solution of management’s problem – that is, price raising – has been facilitated by our elastic monetary system, and we are now drifting along on a Sybaritic course of mild inflation as a way of life. The second solution of management’s problem of meeting labor’s wage demands has accelerated piecemeal mechanization, yesterday’s infant “scientific management,” today’s adolescent automation. [And still there are some who say the class struggle has disappeared!] ...
I strongly suspect that we have already built up at many points a productive capacity in excess of the absorptive capacity of the forthcoming market under city and country income patterns that have been provided, and employment patterns that will result from this automated operation. We are told on impressive authority that we have not been making adequate capital provision for re-equipping industry in step with the progress of technology. This is probably true if it means making full application of electronic devices and univac controls generally throughout our industrial plant. But we have not yet demonstrated our ability to adjust the actual market of 1956-1957, etc., to the productivity of the production lines we have already “modernized.” They have not yet come to full production, but as they do we see incipient unemployment appearing. Since that, along with slight credit tightening, will tend in some degree to restrict the market appetite, it seems likely that next year will see a still further enlarged output somewhat out of balance with this reduced demand. Suggestions have been made that balance could be restored by lowering prices or by cutting the work week. Both processes take time and present their own difficulties. Meanwhile, the current trend is toward higher prices reflecting wage advances already negotiated ... (My Italics – T.N.V.)
In the course of these hearings various members of the committee and its staff have raised the question whether legislation should be recommended to deal with the problems created by so-called automation. The answer, I think, is an unqualified NO. To curb or redirect the process of scientific discovery and engineering application and the adaptations of businessmen and consumers to these changes would be utterly repugnant to the system of free enterprise and individual choice that have made our country great. None the less, every time the Congress passes a money bill, every time it revises our tax structure, every time it passes a regulatory measure for price maintenance (alias “fair trade”), farm price supports (alias “parity”), or stockpiling of copper, rubber, wool, or silver it is giving punch-card or tape instructions to some part of the continuous flow mechanism of our economy. Public policy on all these matters should be framed in the light of the fullest possible understanding of the integrated character of the price-income structure and behavior of our economy, with an eye single to promoting “maximum production, employment, and purchasing power” for the whole people, not to serve the immediate interest of any special group ...
But in a free enterprise system human judgment is given play at most of the important points of interrelationship. Unless the responsible executives seek to integrate their operations to the prosperity of the whole economy and use the full apparatus available for gathering and processing the data relevant to policy determination our economic process will disintegrate into wasteful struggles for individual or group short-run advantage. Much of the potential benefit of technological progress (of which automation is one particular expression) may be lost through failure to make our economic structure and practices equally scientific.
It is not necessary to belabor the point. There are sharp differences of opinion within the bourgeoisie itself on the outlook for 1956. The fact that some of the more eminent representatives of the bourgeoisie are not too confident about the outlook for 1956 or about the perpetual prosperity that the disciples of the new era proclaim, ought to give these disciples some pause. That it will, however, is highly dubious. They will have to encounter hard reality before their views are shaken.
Perhaps the proper way to put it is that there is a form of malaise penetrating almost every sector of society. For example, The New York Times’ column, The Merchant’s Point of View, in its December 11, 1955, issue, states:
“Industrial production, now leveling off after surpassing all previous peaks, will be unable to take care of a growing labor force. This will mean a rise in unemployment which can exercise a dampening effect upon buying enthusiasm.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
If the business cycle has been eliminated, or if severe depressions are a thing of the past, relegated to the history books, one may logically ask, why does this feeling of malaise persist?
The previously cited monthly letter of the First National City Bank of January 1956 observes:
The economy does not yet show convincing signs that excesses have reached dangerous proportions, nor are they in any sense inevitable, but they could develop if we substitute enthusiasm for caution and emphasize prosperity to the extent that we forget its problems. The biggest problem of all is to slow down to a sustainable rate of growth without going through a cycle of boom and bust.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Is this merely a psychological hangover from the past history of capitalism or is there a realistic danger that depressions are still possible?
It seems to us that the general feeling of cautiousness or malaise that has more recently penetrated the more knowledgeable circles of the bourgeoisie and its spokesmen, is not without practical foundation. The recent boom has rested in large part on the automobile and construction industries. If these industries are indeed headed for declines of 10 to 15 per cent, then there will be rapid repercussions throughout the economy.
As for the outlook for the automobile industry, previously we cited the opinion of Henry Ford II. We now have the opinion of Harlow H. Curtice, president of the General Motors Corporation, that there will be a 12 per cent drop from the 1955 production total of 7,940,862 cars. This would be almost one million cars less to be produced in 1956 than in 1955.
George Romney, president of American Motors Corporation, put the decline at 15 per cent. Only L.L. Colbert, president of the Chrysler Corporation is bullish among the automobile magnates.
As The New York Times of December 11, 1955, put it:
“Nobody in the industry talks about market saturation. But nobody denies that sales are becoming increasingly difficult to make.”
As a matter of record, and as reported in The New York Times of December 25, 1955, the new car inventories have increased to the very substantial stockpile of 710,000, which is a record for this time of the year when new models have just been introduced. Even more significant is the fact that this large figure includes 325,000 new 1955 models which are likewise awaiting disposal.
An Automotive News tabulation, according to The New York Times article mentioned in the preceding paragraph, shows that before the full production of 1956 models got under way the dealers had 569,335 new cars on hand. For December 1954 the total stood at 265,153 units. In other words, there has been a substantial increase in the stocks of available cars, or to put the matter in simpler terms, production is outstripping sales. Automobile dealers are being squeezed and are beginning to go out of business.
It would appear to be the overwhelming consensus that American capitalism cannot in 1956 duplicate the almost 8,000,000 passenger car production of 1955. There will be a decline of 10 to 15 per cent. A decline of this magnitude is a matter not only of several billion dollars of automobiles, but of steel, parts and all the various supporting and allied industries, and has an accumulative effect for the simple reason that the automobile industry stands at the apex of the economy.
If it were possible for capitalism constantly to increase the output of automobiles and allied products and to dispose of them, then there might well be hope for the “permanent peace and prosperity” school. The facts, however, are otherwise. The natural laws of capitalism assert themselves in relatively quick order and we find that relative over-production is today a current problem plaguing the automobile industry. Tomorrow, the problem will be unemployment in the automobile industry and its allied industries.
As I told the editor when this article was requested, if he were willing to wait a few months history would provide all the answers needed to the nonsense that American capitalism has achieved permanent peace and prosperity. So far as the automobile industry is concerned, The New York Times of January 14, 1956, reveals that the manufacturers of automobiles are themselves not independent of economic facts, nor are they disposed to rely entirely on the verbiage of their public relations departments. The inevitable has happened, and sooner than expected. The headline, Big 3 Car Makers Cut Work Forces, makes it very clear that the predictions of a decline in automobile production in 1956 are about to be realized.
The subject has far greater importance than the 8500 workers who have so far been laid off at 15 or so automobile plants. To quote The New York Times:
A series of lay-offs was announced yesterday by the Big Three auto companies.
As one of them put it, the lay-offs were ordered to “maintain a balance between passenger car production and market demand.”
It has been no secret in the industry that sales of the 1956 models have been disappointing and new cars are piling up on dealers’ lots. Auto executives have frankly predicted some decline this year from the record sales and output of 1955, although they do not agree on how much of a decline it will be.
In recent weeks, the industry has abandoned Saturday and other overtime work, which had prevailed almost without a break for more than a year. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The automobile industry graphically illustrates the dynamic character of present-day capitalism, with its enormous accumulation of capital and consequent increase in productivity of labor.
 
Just what has been the rise in the productivity of labor is a subject which baffles the specialists. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has worked out many different methods of estimating productivity, and they generally show an increase of 3 to 3.6 per cent annually, depending upon the method used. In some industries, however, depending upon the method used, there can be an annual increase of labor productivity of as much as 10 per cent or more, the automobile industry being one of the noteworthy industries in this respect. If, however, we take a very conservative figure of a little better than 3 per cent as the annual increase in labor productivity, and if we recall that we now have an economy where there are well over 60 million employed, it is clear that normal increase in labor productivity, which accompanies normal accumulation of capital, renders superfluous approximately 2,000,000 workers each year. That is, this number would be rendered superfluous unless the economy could increase its output sufficiently to absorb this amount.
In addition to these 2,000,000 relatively displaced workers, for whom jobs must be found each year, there are, due to the increase in population, approximately 700,000 new entrants into the labor force each year. Here, then, is a measure of the problem that confronts American capitalism. Production must be increased sufficiently to absorb in the neighborhood of 2,700,000 workers annually in order merely to stand still so far as unemployment is concerned. Should there be instead of a five per cent increase in production, or a nine per cent increase which has been recorded in 1955, a decline of 10 per cent or even of five per cent, the results will be noticeable in very short order and will astound the advocates of the “permanent peace and prosperity” school.
The tip-off, in its own way, that 1956 will indeed be a considerably different year than 1955 is seen in the Christmas announcement by General Electric that its appliance prices are being slashed up to 30 per cent. This constitutes a reduction, according to an article in The New York Times, December 25, 1955, of approximately $23 million at retail for G.E. products. For example, a G.E. vacuum cleaner that has been selling for $69.95 will now be listed at $49.95. A G.E. toaster that had been sold for $19.95 will now be available at $17.95. The automatic steam iron has been reduced from $17.95 to $14.95. And so it goes.
Already G.E.’s competition has been forced to toe the line and other appliance manufacturers have announced similar or identical, or, at the very least, comparable reductions.
In part, undoubtedly G.E.’s move was designed to get a jump on Westinghouse, its major competitor whose production is considerably retarded by the present strike; in part no doubt, G.E.’s action is motivated by its desire to meet competition from the discount houses. But in part, and this is the most important part so far as we are concerned, the action of G.E. is predicated upon the fact that it has become increasingly difficult for G.E. dealers to dispose of G.E.’s enormous production. The squeeze is on, and as a matter of fact, the aspect of G.E.’s price reduction which received most comment in the business press is not the actual reduction in prices themselves, but the fact that G.E. took the revolutionary step of reducing the margins of profit available to the wholesaler and retailer. This is absolutely unprecedented in recent years and its consequences will indeed be far-reaching.
The automobile situation and the appliance situation typify the growing crisis in consumer durables – one of the twin peril points confronting American capitalism as it enters 1956.
 
THE OTHER PERIL POINT IS the agricultural crisis. Here, of course, there is no dispute about the fact that there is a crisis and that its political repercussions must be profound. Many competent observers, for example, interpret the large-scale Democratic victories in the by-elections of 1955 as due to the fact that the farm population, as a whole, has not participated in the boom; that the agricultural crisis has started much earlier and has deepened progressively as time goes on. This, of course, is in accordance with a typical capitalist pattern. It does not, however, alleviate the situation so far as the farmer or the political impact of the farmers’ crisis are concerned.
For a measure of the agricultural crisis we can turn to the November 1955 issue of the Survey of Current Business, the publication of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This staid official government publication is certainly not going to exaggerate the proportions of the agricultural crisis. Yet, in an article by L. Jay Atkinson entitled Agricultural Production and Income, it is stated:
The pressure of increased supplies has been such that a further decline has occurred in agricultural prices and in farm income. In the first three-quarters of 1955, cash receipts from farm marketings and CCC loans were about 4 per cent below a year earlier. Prices were about as much lower with the volume of marketings running about even with 1954. Production expenses have continued little changed and net farm income was down about one-tenth in the first 9 months of 1955 as compared with a year earlier.
Further on Mr. Atkinson states:
The decline in farm income and the small change in the asset position of farmers in recent years compares with a very substantial general advance in income and net assets in the non-farm economy. Although a gradual decline in the share of income from agricultural sources has occurred for a considerable period in the United States, a sharper drop in the past several years reflects a combination of curtailed exports of farm products and a considerable increase in output. The related influence of rising agricultural output throughout the world has effected a substantial reduction in world agricultural raw material prices and has limited any rise in United States farm exports during a period of stepped- up efforts at surplus disposal.
These influences have lowered farm income from the high level attained after the end of World War II despite a rise in consumer demand for farm products. They have been accompanied by a considerable shift in workers from farm to non-farm areas. After allowing for the reduction in the number of persons on farms, income from farming per person living on farms is down about one-fourth from the postwar high, and per capita income of the farm population from both farm and non-farm sources is off about one-eighth. Meanwhile non-farm personal income per capita has continued to advance. Farm income per capita now bears about the same ratio to non-farm income per capita as in 1929. (My italics – T.N.V.)
Of course, the record production has occurred in the face of all types of incentives to reduce production and more of the same is the only program that the Eisenhower Administration has to offer. It is clear that the relative position of the various farming classes has worsened materially in the post-war years and the end is not in sight.

It will be seen that total farm output has increased 12 per cent during the past six years, which include the Korean war and the post-Korean war periods. The major increase has taken place in livestock and related products. Since the proposed incentives to reduce acreage will not in any way inhibit increases in livestock and related production, there can only be a further accentuation of this disproportion.
The proof of the pudding, so far as the farmers as a whole are concerned, is reflected in the parity ratio – this dubious measure of the ratio of prices received to prices paid, going back to a base of 1910–1914.
Whatever we may think of parity as a concept, the fact of the matter is that the trend in the parity ratio does reveal in one simple index what has been happening to the farming classes as a whole and is a relatively accurate measure of the extent of the agricultural crisis.
The current agricultural crisis is hardly a new development. It had its roots in the last years of the Truman administration, as world agricultural production was restored to pre-war levels, thereby beginning the decline in the export of large quantities of surplus American farm products. Throughout the Eisenhower administration the problem of the farmers – which in turn is a direct product of their relatively worsening economic situation – has been one that is uppermost in the minds of the politicians and frequently makes the headlines of the daily press.
The trend was quite clear almost three years ago when we wrote The Permanent War Economy Under Eisenhower in the March–April 1953 issue of The New International. On the subject of the parity ratio we had this to say at that time:
The parity ratio, comparing prices received and paid by farmers, shows a perceptible decline during 1952. The figure was 105 in January 1952, but declined almost 10 per cent to 95 in January 1953. Since the parity ratio is based on average prices received and paid by farmers in the period 1910–1914, which was a rather good period for American farmers, a parity ratio below 100 does not indicate that farmers are starving. But a decline of 10 per cent in a year is precipitous, and when the parity ratio goes below 100 (which it did beginning November) political storms start brewing in the Congressional farm bloc.
The latest figure available for November 1955 shows that the parity ratio has declined to 81. In November 1954 the parity ratio was 87. For three years the parity ratio has declined from 100 to 81 – a decline of 19 per cent, or better than an average of six per cent annually.
This steady persistent decline in the parity ratio merely reflects the deepening agricultural crisis. It takes place because agriculture is the classic case where capitalist production quickly outruns available markets. It is taking plate, moreover, at a time when American imperialism is seeking to prevent the crisis in consumer goods from deepening and paralleling that in agriculture.
Hence, there is a frantic search for export markets for the products of American industry. American capital investment abroad has doubled in the postwar period, private investments abroad reaching about 326.5 billion at the end of 1954.
Of course, to the extent that American capitalism succeeds in alleviating the developing crisis in consumer durable goods by increasing the export markets for these products, to that extent will it aggravate the agricultural crisis. For in most cases the only manner in which these countries of the Western Hemisphere and western Europe can pay for the industrial products of America is through raw materials and agricultural products.
The tremendous increase in the output of farm products is a result of the application on a constantly expanding scale of large-scale capitalist methods of production to farming. All kinds of new agricultural implements and labor-saving devices have been developed and produced, so that with a constantly falling farm population it has been possible steadily to increase the output of agricultural products.
The process of government intervention has not ceased under the Eisenhower Administration. According to The New York Times of January 11, 1956:
“The Agricultural Department reported today that the Government’s investment in price- supported farm products amounted to $8,206,826,000 on Nov. 30.
“This was an increase of $1,316,809,000 from Nov. 30, 1954, when the investment stood at $6,890,017,000.”
In other words, during the past year there has been an increase of almost 20 per cent in the government’s investment in price-supported farm products – at a time when the parity ratio has declined another six points.
It is only natural, therefore, that the farm problem is of sufficient magnitude to occasion a special presidential message – particularly since 1956 is a presidential election year. This message was delivered by Eisenhower on January 9. Its major feature is the establishment of what is euphemistically called a “soil bank.” This means that farmers will be paid in cash or surplus commodities for withdrawing surplus producing land and putting it into soil-saving crops. Producers of cotton, wheat, corn and rice will be paid in cash or in kind from government stocks for reducing acres already allotted to them under federal controls. Cash will also be paid to farmers who devote their acreage to the so-called soil-building crops.
How this tepid proposal is to solve the agricultural crisis – assuming that it will be approved by the Congress, which is a large assumption indeed – is not at all clear, not even to the proponents of the proposal. It is both ironic and significant that the only person of any note to praise the program enthusiastically was Henry Wallace, former Secretary of Agriculture under Roosevelt, under whose auspices the AAA developed the classic capitalist theory of paying farmers to plow under every third row of cotton and wheat during the depths of the depression.
In the agricultural crisis there has existed for decades one of the truly fundamental contradictions of American capitalism – for which there is and can be no solution under capitalism. It is theoretically possible for the American bourgeoisie to discuss a solution comparable to that which the British bourgeoisie instituted over a century ago with the repeal of the Corn Laws, whereby British farming was abandoned to its fate and British capitalists permitted their customers in other lands who were buying their industrial exports to pay for them through agricultural imports into Britain. While a comparable program might be considered to be the goal of certain sections of the American bourgeoisie, it is clearly too risky in this day and age when a world war can easily become a fact of political life. In fact, it is easy for the opponents of any such plan to argue that the abandonment of the American farmer to the tender mercies of unbridled competition would merely encourage Stalinist imperialism to unleash World War III.
Thus the only thing that happens to the agricultural crisis is that it gets worse, and as it gets worse it has profound political repercussions and ultimately profound consequences on the entire economy. It is the agricultural crisis that provides the general background and setting for the developing crisis in consumer durables, both of which make it clear that to talk of permanent prosperity under capitalism is just so much poppycock.
 
DOES THIS MEAN THAT A LARGE-SCALE depression in 1956 is a realistic possibility? Obviously not. There have been certain fundamental changes in the nature and functioning of capitalism, two of which must be singled out for comment at this time. One of them has to do with the so-called built-in stabilizers, unemployment insurance, etc., constantly referred to by the advocates of the “permanent peace and prosperity” school. These are real and they do help to introduce an element of a sort of planning, which certainly prevents any rapid downward tobogganing of the various economic indexes. As unemployment develops, for example, it does not have precisely the same cumulative depressing effect on the markets for food, clothing and other basic economic necessities as formerly. The ability to manipulate tax rates likewise is a stabilizing element which should not be minimized. Since the recent boom has to a large extent been supported by the phenomenal accumulation of capital in the form of vast expansion in plant and equipment, it is not too much to say that the new tax law, with its new provisions for rapid depreciation, has played a great role in encouraging accumulation of capital.
Business borrowing has increased substantially, causing the government to raise the Federal Reserve discount rate to 214 per cent, a 20-year high. Interest rates in general have been rising. Bank loans increased about $3 billion during 1955, an increase of 16 per cent above the 1954 figure.
One of the interesting aspects of the boom in accumulation of capital is that it has largely been financed out of profits and surplus values accumulated in past periods. As The New York Times of January 8, 1956, puts it:
A detailed breakdown of long-term corporate financing in 1955 shows another striking phenomenon. Despite the sharp rise in business activity, external financing – raising funds from outside sources – did not increase. It ran at about $6,000,000,000, the same or a slightly higher rate than in 1954.
It should not be forgotten, in passing, that the need for financing in 1955 was great indeed. Companies spent more than $24,000,000,000 on plant and equipment, some $2,000,000,000 more than in 1954.
So where did business get the needed funds? The bulk by far, came from its own inner resources – earnings and depreciation allowances.
Retained earnings in the first half of last year amounted to $4,700,000,000. On that basis, for the year as a whole they totaled well over $9,000,000,000. When the final figures are toted up, that will probably set a new high record.
And take depreciation allowances, a steadily increasing factor in meeting capital requirements. Last year they topped $14,500,000000, a jump of more than $1,500,000,000 above the 1954 level.
Depreciation has bulked ever larger in corporate financial plans for several reasons. For one thing, the pressure of competition has forced constant additions to plant and equipment. Gross depreciable capital assets of non-financial corporations have soared to an astronomical $302,000,000,000. The high volume of new expenditures in recent years has meant that, after allowance for write-offs on worn-out and obsolete facilities, gross assets have risen at an annual rate of $20,000,000,000.
Under a “straight-line” depreciation, this increase in assets would boost depreciation allowances by more than $750,000,000 a year. The actual increase, however, has been substantially greater. From 1950 through 1954 and into 1955, for instance, the government’s fast amortization program allowed thousands of defense-supporting companies to write off their depreciation in five years. Facilities valued at more than $30,000,000,000 were granted this rapid write-off privilege.
The tax law of 1954 allowed all businesses to liberalize the basis on which they might depreciate capital assets acquired after January of that year. Previously, the straight-line method had required allowances to be spread evenly over the normal life of the asset; that might be twenty years or so. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
There can be little doubt that the tax swindle law of 1954, the major accomplishment of the Eisenhower Administration, has contributed in no small way to the recent boom. The acceleration of the consumption of capital, however, does not in the long run eliminate the business cycle. If anything, it tends to aggravate the business cycle, for one must never forget that the basic law of motion of capitalist economy is Marx’s general law of capitalist accumulation: the greater the increase in capital accumulation, the greater the increase in the industrial reserve army.
We have analyzed for some years now, how the Permanent War Economy has tended to offset and to transform Marx’s general law of capitalist accumulation into one which reflects itself primarily in a relative decline in the standard of living of the working class. This, however, does not mean that the capitalist economy is either crisis-free or unemployment-free.
What these trends do, of course, is merely to reinforce a fundamental capitalist trend toward increasing monopoly. As Marx has pointed out, capitalism constantly strives in the direction of reaching the ultimate goal of one monopoly capitalist, but never, of course, quite reaches that exalted state of affairs.
In this connection it is interesting to note that now that the Democrats are in control of the committees of the Congress, the trend toward monopoly is receiving more publicity than previously. In a report published in The New York Times of December 27, 1955, we find that the sub-committee of the House Judiciary Committee investigating the question of monopoly – a committee headed by Representative Celler – agreed unanimously that “mergers were reaching a record for 25 years.” The Democrats, of course, blame the Republicans for this development, and the Republicans refuse to accept this responsibility.
According to this report, since January 1951 more than 3,000 companies in manufacturing, mining, trade and services have “disappeared in the swelling merger tide.”
It is true, of course, that the current wave of mergers is on an exceedingly large scale, and that it already has had the effect of confining the fantastic profits of the past few years to the largest corporations.
We must remember, however, in any analysis of the economy that these developments are taking place under a new stage of capitalism, one which we have described as the Permanent War Economy.
 
THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS THIRD SECTOR of the economy, i.e., outlays for the means of destruction as contrasted with outlays for the means of production or outlays for the means of consumption, is dramatically illustrated by a recent report of the Department of Defense, entitled Real and Personal Property as of December 31, 1954. We find that as of this date “the aggregate value of properties and inventories included in this report amounts to $123.9 billion for the Department of Defense.” This grand total is comprised of $34,082,000,000 for the Department of the Army; $56,428,000,000 for the Department of the Navy (including the Marine Corps); and $33,356,000,000 for the Department of the Air Force.
Major equipment in use for the entire armed forces totals $48,539,000,000, over 60 per cent of which belongs to the Navy. Equipment and supplies in the supply system account for a slightly larger figure, exceeding $50 billion, and more than $21 billion is in real property inventories, with almost $3 billion in machine tool inventories.
As The New York Times comments editorially on this report in its issue of October 31, 1955:
“An inventory of our national defense system brings up the astonishing figure of $124 billion as the current level of our military assets. This, of course, is still not the total figure. It does not include the atomic energy establishments, nor by any means all of the military materials now in use.”
It is, however, a staggering figure and the question logically arises, suppose that the Permanent War Economy did not exist and that instead of $124 billion of real and personal property belonging to the Department of Defense, the figure were only 10 per cent of this amount, what then? So far as the business cycle is concerned, the postwar prosperity would have ended quite some time ago.
It is worth trying to get some perspective on the extent of the military establishment and the nature of the investment that comprises the third sector of the economy, outlays for the means of destruction.
We find, for example, the extent of the acreage controlled is vast. To quote the report:
“The Department of Defense through the three military departments controlled a total of 29.4 million acres of land throughout the world on 1 January, 1955. This included land owned, leased, used on temporary permit, and various occupancy rights.”
In the United States alone, the acreage controlled totaled 24,172,739 acres, costing the government over $17.5 billion and representing about 37,800 square miles, equivalent to 1.3 per cent of total land area in continental United States.
The almost $3 billion inventory of machine tools, which admittedly is far from a complete tally, represents 2,494,363 metal cutting tools and 388,768 metal forming tools. If the military establishments had ordered only, say, 10 per cent of this quantity, what would be the situation in the machine tool industries today? Much the same question can be asked with reference to the more than $50 billion in inventories in the supply system throughout the entire armed forces.
The size and extent of the military establishment of American capitalist imperialism is so vast that it is difficult to appreciate its precise economic and political weight. The virtual interlocking directorate that has been established between the leaders of big business and the leaders of the military establishment is, however, a fact. It could not exist without the development of the Permanent War Economy and its mere existence and continuation have caused a qualitative change in the nature and functioning of the business cycle.
Of course, the direct investment in the establishments of the Department of Defense is not the sole measure of the importance of war outlays in the total economy. To this must be added the expenditures that are made for foreign aid, both military assistance and economic and technical assistance.
In a very interesting article in The New York Times of December 1, 1955, James Reston analyzes the dispute that has taken place between the advocates of a flexible and limited program and the advocates of a permanent commitment to this type of program.
As Reston puts it, the “Young Turks” (represented by such stalwart Eisenhower Republicans as Stassen, Nelson Rockefeller and Nixon):
“... are enthusiastic about the foreign aid program, want it to be larger, think it is a good thing in itself, good for the United States, and good for the development of a healthy world economy, which helps the United States.” (My italics – T.N.V.)
In the course of this article Reston supplies some convenient summary figures on the expenditures for foreign aid, as follows:

It will be seen that over $31 billion will have been spent for this purpose in a seven-year period. Again, we are dealing with a type of economic outlay which was unknown before the advent of the Permanent War Economy and one which is quantitatively not insignificant – either in its economic or political impact.
 
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PRODUCTION OF means of destruction as a significant sector of the economy, both quantitatively and qualitatively, has necessarily altered many of the fundamental laws of motion of capitalism. It has not, however, transformed capitalism into a system capable of producing permanent peace and prosperity. It has not eliminated the class struggle either nationally or internationally. It has not eliminated the need for a socialist organization of society. On the contrary.
Despite the inflationary boom that has taken place during the past 18 months or so – let us admit that its size and extent have amazed us at least as much as it has amazed the leaders of the bourgeoisie – the process of atrophy that we have described repeatedly during the past several years remains at work.
Government intervention in its manifold forms may possibly reduce what otherwise would perhaps be a level of unemployment of 10 million to one of 5 million (in a period of recession under the Permanent War Economy, which is in the process of developing) but it is entirely possible that the political impact of an unemployment level of five million in an economy so highly geared as the present, may have far more serious consequences for the class struggle than 10 million did in the 1930s.
To put the matter another way, when the ratio of war outlays to total production declines, we find that the hypodermic effect of these injections into the economy is considerably more weakened than the mere recital of the figures would lend one to believe. It is, to use the metaphor of the drug addict, a case where a constantly increasing dosage is required to achieve the same effect, so that when a period arrives when the dosage is decreased the effects on the patient are startling.
To say that the recent boom has been purely a peacetime boom, without benefit of war outlays, as do many of the advocates of the “permanent peace and prosperity” school, is to fly in the face of facts. The ratio of war outlays to total production has undoubtedly declined somewhat in the last few years (the detailed computations and their analysis must await another article) but they still remain well above the 10 per cent level which we originally established as the significant dividing line.
A precarious economic equilibrium has been achieved both domestically and internationally. The extent of the precariousness is about to be revealed. Despite the very sizable production increases of the past 18 months, factory employment is still below 1953’s highs, thereby revealing that the boomlets must necessarily be shortlived.
Had not the Korean war intervened, the present measures of state intervention would long ago have been revealed as inadequate to achieve any type of capitalist stabilization. The forces of production are on the verge of breaking through their capitalist integument. The development of atomic power will require socialism. That is the true measure of the profound social crisis that exists in a very real sense throughout capitalist society today. That is why this feeling of malaise penetrates all sections of the bourgeoisie from the most prosperous to the least. They know that this prosperity is, above all, temporary.
The precarious equilibrium of the domestic economy, in turn, rests upon an equally precarious international equilibrium. So long as this relative balance of forces is maintained between Stalinist and American imperialism, and so long as the fear of total destruction operates to restrain an immediate resort to military adventures, the precarious equilibria, both internationally and domestically, can continue. This, however, is clearly a very limited situation.
An interesting document in this connection is a study prepared for the Joint Committee on the Economic Report by the Legislative Reference Service of the Library of Congress. It is entitled, Trends In Economic Growth, A Comparison of the Western Powers and the Soviet Bloc, and was published in 1955.
It is not necessary to go beyond two of the important conclusions to realize that the international equilibrium is indeed temporary and precarious.
In connection with power, which after all is crucial, the report states: “Atomic power, if it were to be systematically developed by either Western Europe or the Soviet Bloc at relatively low cost, could alter the economic balance between the two areas quickly.” Since both sides are feverishly straining to develop atomic power, how long will it be before one or the other succeeds in obtaining this relative advantage which would immediately upset the precarious equilibrium?
So far as the growth of the respective economies is concerned, the report states that:
“In the period 1938–1953, as a whole, the national product of the United States increased about three times as rapidly as that of independent Europe, and almost twice as rapidly as that of the Soviet Union. To a substantial degree, this difference reflects the varying effects of World War II. Between 1948 and 1953 the national product of the United States grew not quite 30 per cent faster than that of independent Europe and only two-thirds as fast as that of the Soviet Union.” (My italics – T.N.V.)
In other words, in the real postwar period the economy of the Soviet Union has been outstripping that of the United States in a ratio of 3 to 2.
No wonder the inheritors of Stalin’s empire prefer a period of “competitive coexistence,” for even if we assume that American output today, and the strength of America and its allies in general, is twice that of the Soviet Union, or of the Soviet Union and its allies, it would take less than 10 years – assuming that the Soviet Union maintains its relative advantage of an annual increase that exceeds that of the United States by a ratio of 3 to 2 for the Russian economy to surpass that of the United States. At the present respective rates of increase, even without the inevitable recession in the United States, it would take less than a decade for the balance of power to be radically altered.
Once the precarious international equilibrium is basically changed, then the domestic equilibrium, if it has not already been upset, will surely be destroyed.
It is entirely possible that the productivity of labor under Stalinism does not have to equal the productivity of labor under capitalism before the former has achieved military-economic supremacy over the latter. We do not, however, have to speculate about these matters. It is sufficient merely to postulate that the international equilibrium is precarious and necessarily short-lived. This, whether they admit it or not, destroys a fundamental postulate of the advocates of the “permanent peace and prosperity” school, for what they are really saying is that internationally the power blocs constituting Stalinist imperialism on the one hand, and American and allied imperialism on the other hand, can continue indefinitely their huge level of armaments.
It is true, of course, that both Stalinism and capitalism require each other in order to exist. This is one of the paradoxes and contradictions of the present world situation. While the prospects of a resolution of this cosmic paradox may not seem too bright at this time, that they should not cause any elation in the camp of the “permanent peace and prosperity” school. There is no peace. And the prosperity of American capitalism is built on quicksand, as the future will demonstrate.
January 1956
 




The key to the psychology of mid-twentieth century capitalism is the fear of depression. This fear, or sense of insecurity, has been a basic fact of political and social life since the crisis of 1929. Any economist who has any claim whatsoever to being a theorist has been forced to attempt an explanation of the reasons for depressions and, above all, to reassure himself and society at large that there is no need to fear a recurrence of severe depression.
John Kenneth Galbraith – currently Professor of Economics at Harvard University and author of American Capitalism: The Concept of Countervailing Power [1] – is no exception. As a matter of fact, he begins by stating:
The present organization and management of the American economy are also in defiance of the rules – rules that derive their ultimate authority from men of such Newtonian stature as Bentham, Ricardo and Adam Smith. Nevertheless it works, and in the years since World War II quite brilliantly. The fact that it does so, in disregard of precept, has caused men to suppose that all must end in a terrible smash ... It is with this insecurity, in face of success, that this book, in the most general sense, is concerned. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The reason, consequently, that Galbraith’s concept of countervailing power has created somewhat of a stir in certain academic and liberal circles is that he has written a book aimed at reassuring the bourgeoisie and its supporters that there is really nothing much to worry about, that capitalism is functioning on the whole quite well, and that this is almost if not quite the best possible of all possible worlds. The difficulty, according to Galbraith, is that all classes in society have been victims of false or outmoded economic theories. All that is necessary is to change the theory, accept the validity of countervailing power, and presto chango the fear of depression will disappear.
While this represents a rather touching tribute to the power of ideas in molding men’s lives, it constitutes a real distortion of how ideas develop and how they influence the evolution of society. The entire presuppositions of Galbraith’s theory are laid bare by the following extensive quotation from the end of his first chapter:
Here then is the remarkable problem of our time. We find ourselves in these strange days with an economy which, on grounds of sheer physical performance, few are inclined to criticize. Even allowing for the conformist tradition in American social thought, the agreement on the quality of the performance of American capitalism is remarkable. The absence of any plausibly enunciated alternative to the present system is equally remarkable. Yet almost no one feels secure in the present. The conservative sees an omnipotent government busy altering capitalism to some new, unspecified but wholly unpalatable design. Even allowing for the exaggeration which is the common denominator of our political comment and of conservative fears in particular, he apparently feels the danger to be real and imminent. At any given time we are but one session of Congress or one bill removed from a cold revolution. The liberal contemplates with alarm the great corporations which cannot be accommodated to his faith. And, with the conservative, he shares the belief that, whatever the quality of current performance, it is certain not to last. Yet in the present we survive. With the present, given peace, no one is intolerably unhappy.
It can only be that there is something wrong with the current or accepted interpretation of American capitalism. This, indeed, is the case. Conservatives and liberals, both, are the captives of ideas which cause them to view the world with misgivings or alarm. Neither the structure of the economy nor the role of government conforms to the pattern specified, even demanded, by the ideas they hold. The American government and the American economy are both behaving in brazen defiance of their rules. If their rules were binding, they would already be suffering. The conservative, who has already had two decades of New and Fair Deals would already be dispossessed. The liberal, who has already lived his entire life in an economy of vast corporations, would already be their puppet. Little would be produced; we should all be suffering under the exploitation and struggling to pay for the inefficiency of monopoly. The fact that we have escaped so far means that the trouble lies not with the world but with the ideas by which it is interpreted. It is the ideas which are the source of the insecurity – the insecurity of illusion.
Whether the average individual is as worried as Galbraith thinks he is about the possibility or imminence of depression, is difficult to ascertain. Galbraith’s worry, however, is genuine. It stems from the destruction of the economic foundations of American liberalism. Capitalist liberalism historically was a nineteenth century phenomenon. With the growth of state monopoly capitalism and of monopoly in general the base of liberalism narrowed until it has reached the point where it has virtually disappeared and genuine liberals are as scarce as hen’s teeth. Sooner or later economic theory must correspond to the facts of economic life. In other words, the superstructure, i.e., the world of ideas, flows from the foundation, i.e., the reality.
Liberalism is the child of competitive capitalism, of free enterprise in the true sense of the term. As competition decreased and monopoly grew, it became increasingly difficult for liberals to maintain a theory of liberalism.
Such a theory was badly in need once capitalism entered the stage of permanent crisis following the first world war – and once the authoritarian theories of fascism and Stalinism became fashionable. In the 1930’s the man who saved the day for the liberals was John Maynard Keynes – an English banker who became the bourgeois theorist of the depression era. For it was Keynes who provided the rationale, the justification for state intervention which was absolutely indispensable for the survival of capitalism. In the process, Keynes demolished his predecessors, the classicists and neo- classicists alike.
In an interesting chapter, entitled The Depression Psychosis, Galbraith displays a rather penetrating understanding of Keynes’ rôle. He states:
The ideas which interpreted the depression, and which warned that depression or inflation might be as much a part of the free-enterprise destiny as stable full employment, were those of John Maynard Keynes. A case could easily be made by those who make such cases, that his were the most influential social ideas of the first half of the century. A proper distribution of emphasis as between the role of ideas and the role of action might attribute more influence on modern economic history to Keynes than to Roosevelt. Certainly his final book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, shaped the course of events as only the books of three earlier economists – Smith’s Wealth of Nations, Ricardo’s Principles of Political Economy and Marx’s Capital – have done.
The development of mass unemployment during the Great Depression of the 30’s not only demanded state intervention to preserve capitalism, but demolished the classical theories of free competition that had presumably guided the actions of the American bourgeoisie until that time. Keynes’ system permitted acknowledgment of the existence of unemployment, predicted its development, and appeared to provide a solution to the problem. To quote Galbraith:
The major conclusion of Keynes’ argument – the one of greatest general importance and the one that is relevant here – is that depression and unemployment are in no sense abnormal. (Neither, although the point is made less explicitly, is inflation.) On the contrary, the economy can find its equilibrium at any level of performance. The chance that production in the United States will be at that level where all, or nearly all, willing workers can find jobs is no greater than the chance that four, six, eight or ten million workers will be unemployed. Alternatively the demand for goods may exceed what the economy can supply even when everyone is employed. Accordingly there can be, even under peacetime conditions, a persistent upward pressure on prices, i.e., more or less serious inflation.
Full employment, which the classicists assumed, did not exist. It was so remote that Keynes relegated it to the status of a special and rare case in equilibrium analysis. More often than not, asserted Keynes, the economy would achieve an equilibrium below the level of full employment. This, of course, was heresy to the conventional “vulgar” economists who promptly denounced Keynes. It was, however, rather difficult to ignore the political potential of millions of unemployed. The state had to intervene to try to bolster demand by various pump-priming processes. In the course of providing theoretical justification for state intervention, Keynes had to demolish what was known as Say’s Law – an ancient shibboleth according to which each commodity produced automatically generated the purchasing power required to take that commodity off the market. Keynes discovered something that had been more accurately described by Marx and many others; namely, that a portion of the value of a finished commodity went to the owner of capital and that this value (or, more accurately surplus value in the form of profit, interest or rent) did not necessarily have to be invested in new production. The resultant increase in savings could and periodically did “result in a shortage of purchasing power for buying the volume of goods currently being produced. In that case the volume of goods would not continue to be produced. Production and prices would fall; unemployment would increase ... And this equilibrium with extensive unemployment might be quite stable.”
Once Keynes had established that depressions could and did exist, and that investment did not automatically provide the necessary offsets to savings, the remedy in the form of public spending was clear. As Galbraith puts it:
“Insufficient investment has become the shorthand Keynesian explanation of low production and high unemployment. The obvious remedy is more investment and, in principle, it is not important whether this be from private or public funds. But the expenditure of public funds is subject to central determination by government, as that of private funds is not, so the Keynesian remedy leads directly to public expenditure as a depression remedy.”
The Great Depression has been succeeded by the Permanent War Economy. In this development is rooted the ultimate crisis of liberalism. Neither war nor a war economy is conceivable without rigorous, large-scale state intervention in the economy. The Keynesian theories, as Galbraith is at pains to point out, lose their attractiveness. That is why, in many respects, Galbraith’s American Capitalism reads like the confessions of a liberal. The old theories have been demolished twice over by remorseless reality. A new theory is needed: one that will explain what is apparently transpiring and one which justifies the status quo. Galbraith is attempting to fill the void left by the decline of Keynesianism.
The first point in establishing the nature of the void is to show that the climate is, indeed, different. This is not difficult to do, of course, although Galbraith fails to draw the necessary conclusions. It is only in passing that he reveals any understanding of what has happened, when he states that: “The Great Depression of the Thirties never came to an end. It merely disappeared in the great mobilization of the Forties. For a whole generation it became the normal aspect of peacetime life in the United States – the thing to be both feared and expected.” What is this if not an unconscious reference to the Permanent War Economy?
Even though depressions (and Keynes) are passé,
The depression psychosis not only contributed deeply to the uncertainty and insecurity of Americans in the years following World War II, it also deeply influenced economic behavior ... nearly every major business enterprise in the United States has been operated in the last five years in the expectation that sooner or later there would be a major slump. In late 1946, some 15,000 leading business executives were asked by Fortune magazine if they expected an “extended major depression with large-scale unemployment in the next ten years.” Fifty-eight per cent of those replying (in confidence) said they did. Of the remainder, only twenty-eight per cent said no. Organized labor’s preoccupation with measures to maintain employment and the farmers’ preoccupation with support prices have both reflected the search for shelter from depression. During the last fifteen years, the American radical has ceased to talk about inequality or exploitation under capitalism or even its “inherent contradictions.” He has stressed, instead, the unreliability of its performance.
Keynes provided a theory of depressions and a remedy therefore. Depression, however, is no longer the real danger; in fact, depression – according to Galbraith – is virtually an impossibility.
Given peace, and also freedom from the force majeure of large expenditures for armed forces, considerable confidence could be placed in the Keynesian formula. We could expect it to work [states Galbraith] because we could look forward to the kind of economy in which it is capable of working. Unhappily the prospect is not so favorable. [The PWE dominates the scene.] Although Keynes provided a plausible solution to the problem of deflation and depression, the application of his formula to the economy is not symmetrical. It does not deal equally well with the problem of inflation ... And unfortunately, inflation, not depression, is the greatest present and well may be the most persistent future tendency of the American economy.
Fiscal policy (tax rate manipulation, etc.) and built-in stabilizers (social security, etc.) have done away with depressions and thereby with Keynes. This is a pity, according to Galbraith, as depressions can always be controlled, but then Keynes would still reign supreme and there would be no need for Galbraith to develop his fraudulent concept of countervailing power. Lest we be accused of doing an injustice to Galbraith on this important point, let us quote two more passages. First he states:
Speaking with all the caution that broad generalization requires [sic!], the experience of these years [post-World War II] suggests that there are no problems on the side of depression or deflation with which the American economy and polity cannot, if it must, contend. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Then, in the next breath:
A reading of recent experience has suggested that the American economy is unlikely soon to find, on the side of depression and deflation, any problems with which it cannot contend and none which would require an extension of the scope of centralized decision beyond the impersonal guidance provided by the Keynesian formula. Moreover the same experience of the years between 1945 and 1950 would lead one to expect that it would be against deflation that, most probably, the Keynesian formula would have to be invoked. There are some hitherto unsuspected virtues in deflation. We know it can be countered; it provides the context in which the internal regulators work best. Thus we have a formula which insures a favorable over-all performance of the economy; that formula involves no revolutionary or even very drastic change in the economy or the relation of government thereto; the outlook is for the moderate deflationary tendencies in which both the economy and the formula can be expected to function well. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Unfortunately, Galbraith finished his book after the Korean war had broken out. He was consequently forced to recognize that
military expenditures are increasing rapidly. There has also been a considerable modification of the depression psychosis ... Accordingly, inflation must now be considered not a possibility but a probability. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
These rather lengthy quotations from Galbraith’s economic outlook have been necessary to provide the proper setting for analyzing the concept of countervailing power. First, however, it is necessary to explore what Galbraith means by the term, countervailing power.
Market power has been a central feature of capitalism and competition has been the regulator of markets. These pivotal characteristics of capitalism have been recognized by all economic theories. Classical and neo-classical bourgeois theorists, in fact, centered all attention on market price, its causes, fluctuations and its impact (through the benign regulatory force of competition) on economic equilibrium and growth. The supply-demand equation governed price, and competition among sellers or among buyers (each of whom exercised no effective control over total output or market price) produced the “right” price that assured efficient allocation of resources, full employment and the best possible society. Galbraith succinctly expresses the traditional theory as follows:
In all cases the incentive to socially desirable behavior was provided by the competitor. It was to the same side of the market and thus to competition that economists came to look for the self-regulatory mechanism of the economy. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
But competition was noticeably weakening throughout the twentieth century. By the time of the Great Depression, the presence of monopoly as an important, if not crucial, characteristic of the economy was most difficult to ignore. Theories were being developed on “imperfect” and “monopolistic” competition. In any event, competitive theory as an interpreter of what was happening and as a guide to action was losing adherents with each passing day. This was the climate that nourished the growth of Keynesianism. But Galbraith, from the vantage point of the Permanent War Economy (although, without beginning to realize its implications), seeks a new explanation – one that not only explains what happened in the 1930’s and 1940’s, but one that justifies the status quo of the 1950’s.
The following extensive excerpt from Galbraith’s American Capitalism provides us with the author’s understanding of the background leading to, as well as his definition of, countervailing power:
They [economists] also came to look to competition exclusively and in formal theory still do. The notion that there might be another regulatory mechanism in the economy has been almost completely excluded from economic thought. Thus, with the widespread disappearance of competition in its classical form and its replacement by the small group of firms if not in overt, at least in conventional or tacit collusion, it was easy to suppose that since competition had disappeared, all effective restraint on private power had disappeared. Indeed this conclusion was all but inevitable if no search was made for other restraints and so complete was the preoccupation with competition that none was made.
In fact, new restraints on private power did appear to replace competition. They were nurtured by the same process of concentration which impaired or destroyed competition. But they appeared not on the same side of the market but on the opposite side, not with competitors but with customers or suppliers. It will be convenient to have a name for this counterpart of competition and I shall call it countervailing power. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Before continuing with Galbraith’s exposition of the concept of countervailing power, it is worth digressing to examine the dictionary meaning of the term. Countervail, it seems, can be traced back through old French to Latin, from which it is derived literally as “to be strong against.” The idea of compensation or balance is clearly at the heart of the meaning of countervail and the dictionary defines it as “to act against with equal force or power”; or “to act with equivalent effect against anything.” Note the stress on “equal” or “equivalent” power, as this is precisely what Galbraith has in mind.
To begin with a broad and somewhat too dogmatically stated proposition, private economic power is held in check by the countervailing power of those who are subject to it. The first begets the second. The long trend toward concentration of industrial enterprise in the hands of a relatively few firms has brought into existence not only strong sellers, as economists have supposed, but also strong buyers as they have failed to see. The two develop together, not in precise step but in such manner that there can be no doubt that the one is in response to the other.
The fact that a seller enjoys a measure of monopoly power, and is reaping a measure of monopoly return as a result, means that there is an inducement to those firms from whom he buys or those to whom he sells to develop the power with which they can defend themselves against exploitation. It means also that there is a reward to them, in the form of a share of the gains of their opponents’ market power, if they are able to do so. In this way the existence of market power creates an incentive to the organisation of another position of power that neutralizes it.
The contention I am here making is a formidable one. It comes to this: Competition which, at least since the time of Adam Smith, has been viewed as the autonomous regulator of economic activity and as the only available regulatory mechanism apart from the state, has, in fact, been superseded. Not entirely to be sure. There are still important markets where the power of the firm as (say) a seller is checked or circumscribed by those who provide a similar or a substitute product or service. This, in the broadest sense that can be meaningful, is the meaning of competition. The role of the buyer on the other side of such markets is essentially a passive one. It consists in looking for, perhaps asking for, and responding to the best bargain. The active restraint is provided by the competitor who offers, or threatens to offer, a better bargain. By contrast, in the typical modern market of few sellers, the active restraint is provided not by competitors but from the other side of the market by strong buyers. Given the convention against price competition, it is the role of the competitor that becomes passive ... competition was regarded as a self-generating [italics in original] regulatory force. The doubt whether this was in fact so after a market had been pre-empted by a few large sellers, after entry of new firms had become difficult and after existing firms had accepted a convention against price competition, was what destroyed the faith in competition as a regulatory mechanism. Countervailing power is also a self-generating force and this is a matter of great importance ... the regulatory role of the strong buyer, in relation to the market power of the strong seller, is also self-generating. As noted, power on one side of a market creates both the need for, and prospect of reward to, the exercise of countervailing power from the other side. In the market of small numbers, the self-generating power of competition is a chimera. That of countervailing power, by contrast, is readily assimilated to the common sense of the situation and its existence, once we have learned to look for it, is readily subject to empirical verification. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The monopolist, according to Galbraith, is held in check (and presumably no great degree of state intervention is required) not by his competing monopolist but by his monopolistic countervailing buyer or supplier. Economic (and political) balance is no longer mainly achieved by parallel competition among a great many (small) sellers or buyers but by relatively few huge supplying and buying organizations confronting each other across the supply-demand equation. Moreover, this exercise of what Galbraith describes as countervailing power is really automatic, i.e., self-generating.
According to Galbraith, the importance of countervailing power can be empirically demonstrated in virtually every phase of economic activity where prices are a factor. In fact, he cites the labor market, agriculture and large-scale retailing organizations as the three prime examples of countervailing power. The powerful trade union, the large farmers’ cooperatives and the big chain stores and mail order houses constitute his best illustrations of countervailing power. They have arisen in response to a monopolistic position on the other side of the economic bargaining table. Labor, farmers and consumers (?) need these organizations partly as a matter of self-defense and partly to share the ill- gotten monopolistic gains of their monopolistic antagonists.
The operation of countervailing power is to be seen with the greatest clarity [states Galbraith] in the labor market where it is also most fully developed. [He then cites the case of the steel industry, observing:] As late as the early Twenties, the steel industry worked a twelve-hour day and seventy-two-hour week with an incredible twenty-four-hour stint every fortnight when the shift changed.
No such power is exercised today and for the reason that its earlier exercise stimulated the counteraction that brought it to an end. In the ultimate sense it was the power of the steel industry, not the organizing abilities of John L. Lewis and Philip Murray, that brought the United Steel Workers into being. The economic power that the worker faced in the sale of his labor – the competition of many sellers dealing with few buyers – made it necessary that he organize for his own protection. There were rewards to the power of the steel companies in which, when he had successfully developed countervailing power, he could share.
As a general though not invariable rule there are strong unions in the United States only where markets are served by strong corporations. And it is not an accident that the large automobile, steel, electrical, rubber, farm-machinery and non-ferrous metal-mining and smelting companies all bargain with powerful CIO unions. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
It is true that capitalism has organized the industrial proletariat in large factories and the class struggle has therefore more readily lead to the development of powerful trade unions. These, however, are terms and forces of which Galbraith is totally ignorant.
He is straining to make the facts of life fit his so-called theory of countervailing power. Yet he must recognize that strong unions exist in areas where powerful oligopolies are conspicuous by their absence. He is thus constrained to state:
I do not advance the theory of countervailing power as a monolithic explanation of trade-union organization; in the case of bituminous-coal mining and the clothing industry, for example, the unions have emerged as a supplement to the weak market position of the operators and manufacturers. They have assumed price- and market-regulating functions that are the normal functions of management. Nevertheless, as an explanation of the incidence of trade-union strength in the American economy, the theory of countervailing power clearly fits the broad contours of experience. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Strong unions arise in response to the need of workers to defend themselves from the monopolistic power of large corporations and to obtain a share of the gains of monopoly power for the workers. The function of countervailing power in such instances, it is clear, is a healthy one. It achieves the type of balance of which Galbraith approves. At the same time, in other industries where powerful monopolistic corporations do not exist, strong unions arise “to supplement the weak market position of the operators and manufacturers.” Since the countervailing power of strong unions, however, can only operate against the monopoly power of large corporations, the UMW and the ILGWU must perform the “market functions that normally belong to management”; i.e., they must develop monopolistic powers. It is not precisely clear, however, how a union can share the monopoly power of corporations when such power is non-existent. If Galbraith would study the history of the American labor movement, he might find other reasons for the growth of powerful unions in competitive industries and would thus not try to force his theory of countervailing power to fit facts for which it is patently not designed. It goes without saying that the history of the class struggle provides all the explanations that are necessary for the specific character and strength of the American trade-union movement.
The longest effort to develop countervailing power, according to Galbraith, has been made by the farmer.
In both the markets in which he sells and those in which he buys, the individual farmer’s market power in the typical case is intrinsically nil. In each case he is one among hundreds of thousands. As an individual he can withdraw from the market entirely, and there will be no effect on price – his action will, indeed, have no consequence for anyone but himself and his dependents.
Those from whom the farmer buys and those to whom he sells do, characteristically, have market power. The handful of manufacturers of farm machinery, of accessible fertilizer manufacturers or mixers, of petroleum suppliers, of insurance companies all exercise measurable control over the prices at which they sell. The farmer’s market for his products – the meat-packing industry, the tobacco companies, the canneries, the fluid-milk distributors – is typically, although not universally, divided between a relatively small number of large companies.
Many of the political activities of the farmers, such as the Granger movement, represent attempts to combat the monopolistic buying and selling power to which farmers are opposed in their market activities. The power of the farm bloc in Congress – it is implicit in Galbraith’s analysis flows from these antecedents. “Farmers have turned from the reduction of opposing market power,” according to Galbraith, “to the building of their own.” Here is the explanation of the rise of farm cooperatives.
In seeking to develop countervailing power it was natural that farmers would at some stage seek to imitate the market organization and strategy of those with whom they did business. For purchase or sale as individuals, they would seek to substitute purchase and sale as a group. Livestock or milk producers would combine in the sale of their livestock or milk. The market power of large meat packers and milk distributors would be matched by the market power of a large selling organization of livestock producers and dairymen. Similarly, if purchases of fertilizer, feed and oil were pooled, the prices of these products, hitherto named by the seller to the individual farmer, would become subject to negotiation.
The necessary instrument of organization was also available to the farmer in the form of the cooperative. The membership of the cooperative could include any number of farmers and it could be democratically controlled. All in all, the cooperative seemed an ideal device for exercising countervailing power ...
As a device for getting economies of large-scale operations in the handling of farm products or for providing and capitalizing such facilities as elevators, grain terminals, warehouses and creameries, cooperatives have enjoyed a considerable success. For exercising market power they have fatal structural weaknesses ... It cannot control the production of its members and, in practice, it has less than absolute control over their decision to sell ... A strong bargaining position requires ability to wait – to hold some or all of the product. [The selling cooperative has thus had limited success and required the intervention of the Federal government starting in the Hoover Administration.]
The farmer’s purchasing cooperative is free from the organic weaknesses of the marketing or bargaining cooperative. In the marketing cooperative the noncooperator ... gets a premium for his non-conformance. In the buying cooperative he can be denied the patronage dividends which reflect the economies of effective buying and bargaining. In the purchase of feed, chemicals for fertilizers, petroleum products and other farm supplies and insurance these cooperatives have enjoyed major success.
Galbraith has provided a justification for state intervention in behalf of the farmer that takes the curse off this type of activity and makes it inevitable.
The fact that the modern [farm] legislation is now of two decades’ standing, that behind it is a long history of equivalent aspiration, that there is not a developed country in the world where its counterpart does not exist, that no political party would think of attacking it are all worth pondering by those who regard such legislation as abnormal.
Countervailing power is most effective, it would seem, in the case of large retailing organizations that can exercise unusually strong buying power. States Galbraith:
As a regulatory device one of its [countervailing power] most important manifestations is in the relation of the large retailer to the firms from which it buys.
Again, it is the monopolistic power of the large corporations supplying retailers that provided the need and opportunity for the growth of the A&P, Sears, Roebuck & Co., Woolworth’s, etc. Or, as Galbraith puts it,
in precise parallel with the labor market, we find the retailer with both a protective and profit incentive to develop countervailing power whenever his supplier is in possession of market power. The practical manifestation of this, over the last half-century, has been the spectacular rise of the food chains, the variety chains, the mail-order houses (now graduated into chain stores), the departmentstore chains, and the cooperative buying organizations of the surviving independent department and food stores.
It is clear that Galbraith looks with favor upon the countervailing activities of such large retailing organizations as A&P and Sears, for he feels that it was a mistake even to attempt prosecution of the A&P under the anti-trust statutes, and he clearly lauds Sears for being able to purchase automobile tires at prices from 29 to 40 per cent lower than the market. Consequently, Galbraith is opposed to the Robinson-Patman Act for it fails to distinguish between original power and countervailing power and discriminates against the effective exercise of countervailing power.
When the comprehensive representation of large retailers in the various fields of consumers’ goods distribution is considered, it is reasonable to conclude – the reader is warned [by Galbraith] that this is an important generalization – that most positions of market power in the production of consumers’ goods are covered by positions of countervailing power. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The countervailing power of the large retailing organizations, willy nilly, benefits consumers and eliminates the need of consumers organizing large-scale buying cooperatives similar to those in Scandinavia and England. Here is one of the more significant aspects of Galbraith’s concept of countervailing power, and one of the more facile justifications of the status quo.
States Galbraith:
The development of countervailing power requires a certain minimum opportunity and capacity for organization, corporate or otherwise. If the large retail buying organizations had not developed the countervailing power which they have used, by proxy, on behalf of the individual consumer, consumers would have been faced with the need to organize the equivalent of the retailer’s power. This would be a formidable task but it has been accomplished in Scandinavia and, in lesser measure, in England where the consumer’s cooperative, instead of the chain store, is the dominant instrument of countervailing power in consumers’ goods markets ... The fact that there are no consumer cooperatives of any importance in the United States is to be explained, not by any inherent incapacity of the American for such organization, but because the chain stores pre-empted the gains of countervailing power first. The counterpart of the Swedish Kooperative Forbundet or the British Cooperative Wholesale Societies has not appeared in the United States simply because it could not compete with the A&P and the other large food chains. The meaning of this ... is that the chain stores are approximately as efficient in the exercise of countervailing power as a cooperative would be.
Comment on the above would be largely superfluous, particularly since Galbraith recognizes that, “While countervailing power is of decisive importance in regulating the exercise of private economic power, it is not universally effective.” And he cites the case of the residential-building industry. What Galbraith has failed to comprehend, however, is that consumers are not a class but an economic category cutting across all classes. Consumers cannot easily organize unless, as in England and Scandinavia, there is a strong political party of labor able to sustain an economic organization of consumers who are mainly workers. Here, and not in some mysterious countervailing benefits of monopolistic retail chains, lies the basic explanation of why consumers’ cooperatives have not flourished in the United States.
Labor and farmers, however, represent distinct economic classes. The course of the class struggle – not a fraudulent concept of countervailing power – has led to the development of trade unions and farmers’ buying cooperatives. The dialectic of the class struggle also helps to explain why farmers have achieved considerable political power in the United States, whereas the working class, as yet, has failed to achieve political power commensurate with its economic power. Of course, the struggle between a large-scale retail organization, such as Sears, and an oligopolist manufacturer, like the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, is a form of the class struggle. Only in this case it represents a struggle between segments of the capitalist class and not between different classes. No profound social consequences are really possible in a struggle within the capitalist class, as frequently occurs when the struggle is between the capitalist class and the working class.
Parenthetically, it is interesting to note that, with few exceptions, American bourgeois economics in the last two generations has been devoid of value theory. The concentration on so-called price theory, as separate and distinct from value theory, led ultimately to the enthronement of Wesley Mitchell and his followers at the National Bureau of Economic Research in the so-called Statistical School. Description – in many cases, interesting and unique descriptions – replaced theory. What exists flows from what was, but why is another question. Galbraith, too, is hardly a theorist. It does not even occur to him to question what is involved in the determination of price besides the superficial supply-demand relationships and the bargaining that occurs in the market place. The “theory” of countervailing power is as much a theory of prices and economic behavior as tides, by themselves, are an explanation of weather formation.
Galbraith, however, does have a sense of reality. He is not only aware of the fact that Keynesianism no longer holds sway and that the theories of monopolistic competition possess many inadequacies, but he is constrained to develop some plausible explanation of existing economic conditions that both justifies the status quo and provides a suitable guide to public policy. Giants on either side of the supply-demand equation play the decisive role in price determination, according to the concept of countervailing power, rather than “competition” amongst monopolies operating on the same side of the market. He provides a rationale for both private control of the means of production and limited state intervention to preserve that control. “The present analysis,” he states, “also legitimatizes government support to countervailing power.”
While state intervention has already been sanctioned by Keynesian theory in the need to create demand in a period of depression, Galbraith’s concept of countervailing power justifies state intervention in a somewhat negative way. The thought is rather fully developed in the following paragraph:
No case for an ideal distribution and employment of resources – for maximized social efficiency – can be made when countervailing power rather than competition is accepted as the basic regulator of the economy. Countervailing power does operate in the right direction. When a powerful retail buyer forces down the prices of an industry which had previously been enjoying monopoly returns, the result is larger sales of the product, a larger and broadly speaking a more desirable use of labor, materials and plant in production. But no one can suppose that this happens with precision. Thus a theoretical case exists for government intervention in private decision. It becomes strong where it can be shown that countervailing power is not fully operative.
The major argument against state intervention, in fact, becomes the old chestnut concerning the alleged impracticality and bureaucratic nature of state planning transformed into a wondrous argument about the administrative advantages of decentralized authority. Thus,
Although little cited, even by conservatives, administrative considerations now provide capitalism with by far its strongest defense against detailed interference with private business decision. To put the matter bluntly, in a parliamentary democracy with a high standard of living there is no administratively acceptable alternative to the decision-making mechanism of capitalism. No method of comparable effectiveness is available to decentralize authority over final decisions.
Countervailing power on Galbraith’s own testimony, however, cannot work in a period of inflation and inflation is the basic characteristic of our times. After developing his theory, he states:
I come now to the major limitation on the operation of countervailing power – a matter of much importance in our time. Countervailing power is not exercised uniformly under all conditions of demand. It does not function at all as a restraint on market power when there is inflationary pressure on markets ... Countervailing power, as a restraint on market power, only (Galbraith’s emphasis) operates when there is a relative scarcity of demand. Only then is the buyer important to the seller and this is an obvious prerequisite for his bringing his power to bear on the market power of the seller. If buyers are plentiful, that is, if supply is small in relation to current demand, the seller is under no compulsion to surrender to the bargaining power of any customer. The countervailing power of the buyer, however great, disappears with an excess of demand. With it goes the regulatory or restraining role of countervailing power in general. Indeed, the best hope of the buyer, under conditions of excess demand, may be to form a coalition with the seller to bring about an agreed division of returns ...
When demand is limited, we have ... an essentially healthy manifestation of countervailing power. The union opposes its power as a seller of labor to that of management as a buyer: At stake is the division of the returns. An occasional strike is an indication that countervailing power is being employed in a sound context where the costs of any wage increase cannot readily be passed along to someone else. It should be an occasion for mild rejoicing in the conservative press. The Daily Worker, eagerly contemplating the downfall of capitalism, should regret this manifestation of the continued health of the system.
Under conditions of strong demand, however, collective bargaining takes on a radically different form ... Thus when demand is sufficiently strong to press upon the capacity of industry generally to supply it, there is no real conflict of interest between union and employer. It is to their mutual advantage to effect a coalition and to pass the costs of their agreement along in higher prices. Other buyers along the line, who under other circumstances might have exercised their countervailing power against the price increases, are similarly inhibited. Thus under inflationary pressure of demand, the whole structure of countervailing power in the economy dissolves. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Inflation, of course, has certain beneficiaries: “In the inflation years of the Forties, farmers and recipients of business profits did gain greatly in real income. It is not possible for any reputable American to be overtly in favor of inflation; it is a symbol of evil, like adultery, against which a stand must be taken in public however much it is enjoyed in private.” Inflation eliminates the slack in the economy and makes countervailing power virtually inoperative.
Inflation, moreover, is a characteristic of the Permanent War Economy and makes controls inevitable. This will have a permanent impact on the nature of capitalism, and it is on this rather lugubrious note that Galbraith concludes his book:
Given war or preparation for war – coupled with the effect of these on the public’s expectations as to prices – there is every likelihood that the scope for decentralized decision will be substantially narrowed. It is inflation, not deflation or depression, that will cause capitalism to be modified by extensive centralized decision. The position of capitalism in face of this threat is exceedingly vulnerable. This is not a matter of theory but of experience ... A few months of inflation [in 1950] accomplished what ten years of depression had not required.
The concept of countervailing power, consequently, is counterfeit on two grounds. Firstly, and mainly, it takes what are simple phenomena of the class struggle and erects them into a fraudulent theory that is supposed to explain and justify the status quo. Secondly, it admittedly cannot operate in a period of inflation, which means that its functions are necessarily extremely limited, being restricted to ever-narrowing periods of deflation (at least, according to Galbraith). Countervailing power exists, yes, in so far as it is a manifestation of the class struggle; but that is the only extent to which the concept is valid. The rest is a triumph of public relations and a fraud, although an interesting one, upon an unsuspecting intelligentsia.
The struggle across opposite sides of the marketplace is only one – and a minor phase at that – of the forms of the modern class struggle. As already mentioned, it is essentially a conflict within the capitalist class and, therefore, normally less intense and historically less significant than the class struggle in the factories between capital and labor. Preoccupation with mitigating all forms of the class struggle has become one of the hallmarks of American twentieth century liberalism; and, as a rule, no distinction is made among various types of class struggles. The important thing in the modern liberal lexicon is to have social peace – usually at any price.
Galbraith is no exception to this characteristic liberal approach. If he did not make his position entirely clear to everyone in American Capitalism, he is unambiguous in a paper on Countervailing Power, delivered before the December 1953 annual meeting of the American Economic Association. He states:
I fear I did not make as explicit as I should the welfare criteria I was employing. In partial equilibrium situations, economics has long made the maximization of consumer welfare a nearly absolute goal. Any type of economic behavior which lowered the prices of products to the consumer, quality of course being given, is good ...
In our own time, ... we regularly reject the particular equilibrium test of maximized consumer well-being. We regularly accept measures which raise product prices to ameliorate the grievances or alleviate the tensions of some social group. And it is well that we do. An opulent society can afford to sacrifice material well-being for social contentment. Higher prices of coal or clothing we regard as a small price for freedom from disorder in the coal fields or destitution in the sweatshops.
I doubt whether, in entering a defense of the social utility of countervailing power, I made sufficiently clear whether my standard was the welfare of the consumer or the minimization of social tension. It was natural that perceptive critics would take up the attack on the test of consumer welfare. Had I been less under the influence of this norm myself I would have invited the battle in the area of social harmonies. This, I submit, is also the critical test. American society has not recently been threatened in peacetime (or even in wartime) by a shortage of food. There have been times when the tensions of the farming community were a threat to orderly democratic process. The evolution of countervailing power in the labor market has similarly been a major solvent of tensions in the last half-century. Most would now agree, I think, that this has been worth a considerable price. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The concept of countervailing power – objectively in the view of its creator – has the dual purpose of softening the class struggle (reducing social tensions) and of creating the proper socio-economic climate for progressive economic development (dissipating the psychosis of depression and justifying state monopoly capitalism). In the course of developing his essay in social criticism, Galbraith, as we have pointed out, has had to do violence to many basic social phenomena, such as the nature of and reasons for the growth of the trade-union movement. He has also felt constrained to exhibit his ignorance of Marxism. He obviously believes he is making a telling point when he states: “In the Marxian lexicon, capitalism and competition are mutually exclusive concepts; the Marxian attack has not been on capitalism but on monopoly capitalism.” How one person can be so wrong in such a brief sentence is difficult to comprehend. Suffice it to say, that Marx always held competition to be a basic characteristic of capitalism, and the Marxian analysis of state monopoly capitalism constitutes a fundamental attack on capitalism as a social system that has outlived its historical usefulness.
In the same paper before the American Economic Association, Galbraith is forced to admit that one of his major points – the reduction of consumer prices by large retail chain operations – is not really due to countervailing power, but to competition. He states:
The gains from opposing mass retail buying to large-scale or oligopolistic production have, I think, been fairly generally conceded. The question has been asked, however, as to what eleemosynary instinct causes the gains that are won by the mass buyer to be passed along to the consumer. In my book I argued that it was the result of the shape of the production function in retailing. My critics have suggested that it is because retailing, the mass buyers notwithstanding, is still a competitive industry. (It is likely to remain one, for entry is almost inherently easy.) I suspect they are right. I am sure that I was more than a little reluctant, at this particular stage in my argument, to confess a reliance on competition. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The self-generating character of countervailing power and its beneficent effects become just a series of unproved statements on the part of Galbraith – so much so, that the self-generating character of countervailing power may be labeled a self-generating fraud. This is pretty much the view of Galbraith’s professional critics. States Professor George J. Stigler (in a paper entitled, The Economist Plays With Blocs, delivered at the same session of the American Economic Association):
We must regret that at the very threshold of the doctrine of countervailing power, Galbraith eschews rational explanation. It is not as if one were asking, in the tones of a stuffy formalist, for explicit development of details of a theory whose general outline is familiar or which is a plausible extension of well-explored theories. The theory of bilateral oligopoly can hardly be said to exist, and the theory of bilateral monopoly – which Galbraith disposes of in a singularly high-handed manner – offers only contradictions to his theory ... Galbraith’s notion of countervailing power is a dogma, not a theory. It lacks a rational development and must be accepted or rejected without reference to its unstated logical antecedents ... Nor is there any explanation, in Galbraith’s book or elsewhere, why bilateral oligopoly should in general eliminate, and not merely redistribute, monopoly gains.
Stigler concludes his critique of Galbraith by stating:
I want to close with an apology for the consistently negative attitude I have felt compelled to take with respect to Galbraith’s theory. One would like to speak well of so urbane and witty a presentation. Especially at this season one would like to avoid expressing doubts that a mysterious, benevolent being will crawl down each and every chimney and leave a large income as well as directions to the nearest cut-rate outlet. Yet even at this season, Galbraith cannot persuade us that we should turn our economic problems over to Santa.
Another academic critic, John Perry Miller, in a paper at the same meeting, entitled Competition and Countervailing Power: Their Rôles in the American Economy, summarizes Galbraith’s theoretical approach by stating:
Here indeed is an optimistic doctrine of the dialectic suggesting that it is the search for power and countervailing power rather than self-interest in the search for gain which promotes economic progress. [Miller does not have much faith in countervailing power and expresses his basic attitude by declaring:] The further one burrows into the concept of countervailing power the clearer it becomes that a catchy phrase is being used to cover a variety of situations. It is doubtful whether so used it is a very useful tool of analysis. I doubt, also, that it is good history. And as an instrument of policy it is at best one in a crowded kit of tools along with the traditional tools of the policy of competition.
Nor were the discussants of the main papers at this session on Countervailing Power any kinder toward Galbraith than the official critics. David McCord Wright concludes his discussion with this trenchant blow: “I should judge Dr. Galbraith one of the most effective enemies of both capitalism and democracy.”
While Galbraith is to be commended for writing in non-technical language, and for attempting to relate economic theory to social reality (i.e., for returning to the precepts of political economy), his humor smacks of smart-aleckism and is misplaced in a serious work. The popularity that Galbraith’s book has achieved, however, is not due to its style. And it is only partly due to excellent public relations in its promotion. Countervailing power appeals to a certain segment of intellectuals who are groping for doctrines that will reassure them that their world is not crumbling. This the theory of countervailing power attempts to do. Amidst the general bankruptcy of American bourgeois political economy, Galbraith is refreshing in his candor and style, but destined to a short life as the theorist of the day, for the simple reason that his theory is a fraud and will not even be accepted by the liberal bourgeoisie for whose benefit it was concocted.

The economic outlook for 1954 has now become the dominant question, governing all political forecasts. While it is still eight months to the Congressional elections in November, there can be little doubt that the Republican politicians are worried lest an unfavorable economic outlook accentuate the normal loss of Congressional seats that the party in power must usually expect a non-presidential election year. The result could easily be that the Democrats will capture a solid majority in both Houses of Congress.
Certainly, if unemployment in November exceeds present levels – barring an all-out hot war – the Republicans will suffer a resounding defeat. Just what the present (March) level of unemployment is – the month Eisenhower stated would be decisive in determining whether the Government would intervene in the economy – is impossible to say. The January figure exceeded 3,000,000. The February figure should have been released on March 1st. Publication has been postponed until March 15th. Why? Ostensibly to permit checking of the new sample used to estimate the amount of unemployment. It might also be that the February figure shows unemployment to have risen sharply. Politically, it may be more convenient to announce a February unemployment figure of 4,000,000 or thereabouts at the end of March, while (the administration most hope) advance indications show a decline in unemployment for March.
The Economic Report of the President to Congress, dated January 28, 1954, concludes its evaluation of the current economic outlook by stating: “Our economy today is highly prosperous, and enjoys great basic strength. The minor readjustment underway since mid-1953 is likely soon to come to a close, especially if the recommendations of the Administration are adopted.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.) Actually, the “minor readjustment” is a full-fledged recession, already amounting to a decline of approximately 10 per cent since it began in the second quarter of 1953. The overwhelming majority of economists attending the annual meetings of the American Economics Association and the American Statistical Association at the end of December is clearly of the opinion that “The United States economy already is in a downturn. It faces the prospect of an ‘orthodox recession’ in 1954 with total output down $10,000,000,000 to $18,000,000,000 from 1953’s extraordinarily high levels.” (The New York Times, Dec. 29, 1953.)
While the American economists do not share the opinion of Colin Clark, leading Australian economist, that the economy is heading for a severe depression, they do appear to expect the decline to last throughout 1954. In other words, the professional economists will be surprised if the “re-adjustment” ends “soon.” As a matter of record, the Joint Committee on the Economic Report (officially established by Congress to appraise the President’s Economic Report, and composed of a majority of Republicans) is quoted in the New York Times of February 27, 1951 as “not fully satisfied with the Government’s anti-recession program, and (it) finds the administration’s farm program particularly unsatisfactory.”
Just what is the administration’s “anti-recession” program? It was supposed to have been stated explicitly and at length in the President’s State of the Union Message, the Budget, and the Economic Report. By and large, the Eisenhower anti-recession program consists of three parts denial that a recession exists and one part piously wishing that it would go away – if it does exist. These three major policy documents can be searched from beginning to end, and any anti-recession program will he found conspicuous by its absence. There is discernible an anti-New Deal philosophy, typically expressed by the following paragraph from the Budget Message:
“This budget marks the beginning of a movement to shift to State and local government and to private enterprise Federal activities which can be more appropriately and more efficiently carried on in that way. The lending activities of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation; the services provided by the inland Waterways Corporation; certain agricultural activities; and some aspects of our health, education, and welfare programs are examples of this type of action.”
Nevertheless, there is an administration program. Officially, it can be summarised as providing tax incentives and other necessary stimuli to capital investment. Unofficially, it might he called Turning the Country Back to the Indians (read: Monopoly Capital) or How To Loot the Public Treasury in Three Easy Lessons. Whether it be reducing the taxes on dividends, or more rapid depreciation allowances, or other fiscal policy, the philosophy stems from the theory that what is good for big business (General Motors and its allies) is good for the country.
Much of the theoretical foundation for the administration’s program apparently originates with Arthur F. Burns, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who is interviewed in the New York Times of Feb. 22, 1951 by Joseph A. Loftus on the occasion of the publication of a collection of Burns’ essays. The heart of the Burns philosophy is revealed by the following exchange:
In an essay written in 1948, he made this observation about Government policy in the depression of the Nineteen Thirties:
“On the whole, consumer spending responded much better to the Governmental measures than private investment.”
How, then, could he justify an Administration tax policy now that puts emphasis on incentive to private investment rather than on consumer spending?
The circumstances were quite different then, he explained. The present tax program would have made no sense whatever in the early days of that depression. Business confidence was shattered. Now it is different. Stock prices are up, commodity prices are not down. Investment expenditures are being pretty well maintained. Business confidence is running high. There is a good chance of stimulating investment further.
As the question is being stated – “do you want to stimulate consumption or production?” – Dr. Burns continued, the “underconsumptionists” would win.
But, he said, that does not state the issue correctly. As the facts are now, he said, if you cut a consumer’s tax $1, he may spend from zero to $1, no more. If you cut business taxes $1, business may spend as much as $50. A new environment for business spending is created.
If business confidence is high, why is there need to stimulate it?
There has been a decline, he said, adding that no responsible thinker can say positively it will be self-limiting. It could become a spiraling contraction. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Just what good it would do to stimulate capital expansion, when the source of the present recession is the crisis in agricultural production and in certain consumer durables, especially automobiles, is not explained by Dr. Burns, for he has yet to ask himself (publicly) what is the cause of the present decline? And yet, according to Loftus, in the above-quoted article: “This is some of the thinking of the man who probably does more to shape the economic policies of the Administration than any other individual except the President.”
Whether it is a better understanding of economics, or a keener political sense that is responsible, the Democrats have dramatically focused attention on the Administration’s pro-Big Business orientation by the proposal of Senator George that income tax exemption credit for dependents be increased from the present $600 to $800 and then, next year, to $1,000. Such a proposal, of course, would benefit the mass of the population and would serve to stimulate consumption.
Although the administration has officially come out against the George proposal, Congressional Republicans are uneasy about entering an election campaign with unemployment at the four or five million mark, and with the Democrats pushing tax relief for the masses while the Republicans are committed to tax relief for finance capital. That is why the Joint Committee on the Economic Report, mentioned above, is quoted as saying: “Tax relief for the middle and lower income brackets, to bolster consumer demand, might be desirable sooner than President Eisenhower has indicated.” And further: “Better preparations for a public works program are necessary; there should be a public works administrator, responsible directly to the President, and substantial credit should be available to local communities for such projects.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.) Shades of WPA and PWA!
The Loftus interview with Burns concludes by quoting from one of Burns’ essays: “Subtle understanding of economic change comes from a knowledge of history and large affairs, not from statistics or their processing alone – to which our disturbed age has turned so eagerly in its quest for certainty.” To which we say “Amen!” Such understanding, however, cannot be found in Burns or in the Eisenhower administration.



 


T.N. Vance
March 7, 1951



 



What kind of recession? It is now clear that the Eisenhower recession is no mild, inventory adjustment. In six months, from August 1957 to February 1958, the Federal Reserve Index of industrial production has declined from 145 to 130 – a decrease of more than 10 per cent. Unemployment in February is officially placed at 5,173,000 – an increase of about two million in six months, placing official unemployment at the highest post-World War II level, exceeding by an appreciable amount the 4,700,000 reached in 1949-1950, prior to the break of the Korean war. Steel production is at 52.4 per cent of capacity against 93.5 per cent a year ago. Weekly steel production is currently at 1,415,000 tons – almost a million tons a week less than a year ago. Motor vehicle production is running at 101,266 units a week, compared with 161,865 vehicles in the comparable week 1957. Oil production and freight car loadings are off substantially. In fact, all durables show a 10 per cent decline from February, 1957 to February 1958, with consumer durables down 20 per cent. Business failures are way up, and the pressures for the Federal government to “do something” are increasing daily from virtually every class and every segment of society.
It appears likely that March figures will show further declines. Aside from Fortune magazine and certain other Republican spokesmen for the big bourgeoisie, most analysts and commentators are ready to concede that this is the most serious post-war recession (in fact, before public relations became the chief science of government, this would have been called a depression) and that there will be no immediate upturn. Writes a New York Times financial columnist in the issue of March 23rd: “As the week ended, it was clear that the recession was still in progress, though slowing perhaps. While some of the key economic indicators are still sharply depressed from year-ago levels, their recent rates of decline have slackened. This has led to the belief in some quarters that a ‘bottoming-out’ of the downtrend might be imminent. But little hope is held for any marked up-turn before the fourth quarter of this year or early 1959.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
To be sure, this is not 1929–1933, but it is also not 1948–1949 nor 1953–1954. One should not forget that the recession of 1948–1949 was undoubtedly cut short by the timely (from an economic point of view) arrival of the Korean war. And the recession of 1953-1954 was probably held to minimum duration by the passage of the “tax swindle” Revenue Act of 1954 providing, among other things, for accelerated depreciation. It is also an open secret that major forces within the Eisenhower administration preferred to ignore the signs that the economy was softening and attempted, through strict credit controls and high interest rates, to induce a “little” depression.
The big bourgeoisie, whose captive Eisenhower is, has simply been pursuing the class struggle in its own interests. As we said in our article in the Summer 1957 issue of The New International (p. 178): “The big bourgeoisie demand a halt to inflation, or rather they use the concern of the working classes to prevent inflation as a device for getting the government to raise interest rates and to place a squeeze on small and medium-size business.” It goes without saying that among the calculations of big capital is the expectation that a working class with 5,000,000 or so unemployed will be more docile and its unions more “amenable to common sense” when negotiations for new contracts take place.
Like a breath of clean fresh air, the Eisenhower recession has suddenly swept away all the nonsense about capitalism having achieved “permanent prosperity.” It is clear that the Eisenhower recession is a major cyclical downturn in the epoch of the Permanent War Economy. Its severity is not to be compared with the Great Depression of the 1930’s, but only because capitalism has entered a new stage, which we have named the Permanent War Economy. As we forecast at the conclusion of our previously-quoted article in the Summer 1957 issue of The New International: “The impossibility of continuing to expand in all three departments of production will lead to a deteriorating economic situation and in the relatively near future to the beginnings of a first-rate political crisis.” The deteriorating economic situation is at hand and the political crisis is about to unfold.
 
II
What has happened to the war outlays ratio? In the epoch of the Permanent War Economy stage of capitalism, a prime mover becomes the ratio of war outlays to total production, as we have explained on numerous occasions in these pages. In our article in the Summer, 1957 issue, we presented up-to-date calculations, from which we extract merely the ratio of war outlays to total production from its peak in 1952 through 1956:



Ratio of War Outlays to Total Production




Year


  


Ratio %




1952


16.9




1953


16.8




1954


14.5




1955


13.0




1956


12.7



We estimate that this crucial ratio remained the same in 1957 as in 1956, namely, 12.7 per cent. How, then, could there have been such a sharp decline taking place during the latter part of 1957? A year, of course, is a rather long period of time and such a unit of measure tends to blunt the cyclical fluctuations. These can be seen by examining quarterly movements within the economy, as is also the case for the overall picture of economy.
Gross national product, for example for the year 1957 (see the February 1958 issue of the Survey of Current Business) is estimated at $434.4 billion almost a five per cent increase in prices over the $414.7 billion figure of 1956. To be sure, practically all the increase represents the inflation in prices, but the fact is that for the year as a whole 1957 set a production peak. 1958, of course, will be another story. Yet, if one examines the quarterly movements, the steady upward trend reached its peak in the third quarter, with GNP at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $440 billion, declining in the fourth quarter to a level of $432.6 billion. We can thus pinpoint, so far as gross national product is concerned, the third quarter of 1957 as the start of the Eisenhower recession. And August appears to be the month in which most meaningful indexes turned downwards.
If we examine the ratio of war out-lays to total production in 1957 by quarters, we obtain the following picture (using estimates of the Department of Commerce, in accordance with methods set forth in the Summer 1957 and March–April 1953 issues of The New International):



1957 Quarterly Ratios of War Outlays
to Total Production




I


Quarter


  


12.9%




II


Quarter


13.0%




III


Quarter


12.5%




IV


Quarter


12.5%



Thus, a decline of about four per cent took place in the war outlays ratio between the second and third quarters of 1957. The decline was based on the planned reduction in war outlays by the Eisenhower administration, under the influence of the budget-cutting drive spearheaded by big business organizations and representatives. This, of course, occurred at a time when total output was still increasing and helped to bring about the end of the boom and the beginning of the recession. A war outlays ratio of 12.5 per cent brings us back almost to the pre-Korean level and materially weakens one of the major sustaining props under the economy.
As was to be expected, the Kremlin came to the rescue of sorely beleaguered American capitalism with the Sputnik and the manner in which it was launched. Immediately, the budget-cutting drive ceased and an increase in “defense” expenditures was sanctioned by all classes in American society. The difficulty is that the Federal bureaucracy is a ponderous machine and it takes time for it to move. It will still be several months, before the planned increase in war outlays will be realized in the form of increased production and employment.
Meanwhile, the clamor for immediate action steadily increases. A tremendous debate has arisen between the advocates of increased public expenditures (in which camp are most of the leading Democrats) and the supporters of an immediate tax cut (in which camp are a number of Republican leaders). Many Republicans, of course, still favor doing nothing; and the Administration has stated that it will wait another month before deciding whether special government intervention measures are required.
In this connection, it is interesting to note the position of Professor Arthur F. Burns, formerly Eisenhower’s chief economic advisor. He stated in a speech delivered in Chicago on March 22, and reported in The New York Times of March 23, 1958: “If, on the other hand, we delay more than a very few weeks, in the hope that economic recovery will come on its own by midyear, we shall be taking the risk of having to resort later to drastic medicine.” Burns, it should be noted, is on record as favoring an immediate and permanent “broadly based” $5 billion tax cut.
While a tax cut does not possess the “multiplier” effects of an increase in the war outlays ratio, it can have some hypodermic effect, depending on the nature and size of the tax cut. Neither approach, by itself, carries any promise of arresting the decline in capital accumulation – and it is this, more than any other factor, that bothers the more knowledgeable defenders of the bourgeoisie when they glibly predict that the recession will be of short duration.
 
III
Why the decline in capital accumulation? The figures on capital formation or accumulation always leave much to be desired. Nevertheless, the present trends are unmistakably clear and disputed by no one. Capital accumulation turned downward in 1957 and will continue downward throughout 1958.
If we take the figures on gross private domestic investment in constant (1947) dollars of the Department of Commerce, we get the following totals:



Gross Private Domestic Investment
(in Billions of 1947 Dollars)




Year


  


Billions of Dollars




1953


38.5




1954


37.9




1955


46.6




1956


47.6




1957


44.4



Here, the effects of the accelerated depreciation provisions of the Revenue Act of 1954 are apparent in 1955 and 1956. Yet, a decline of almost seven per cent set in 1957, and all forecasts for 1958 reveal the expectation of further and sharper declines.
If we confine ourselves to plant and equipment expenditures, the most decisive portion of capital accumulation, we find a dramatic rise from $26 billion in 1954 to over $37 billion in 1957. Yet, here, too, the quarterly analysis of 1957 figures shows a decline from a third quarter seasonally adjusted annual total of $37.75 billion to a fourth quarter level of $37.47 with a sharp decline expected to be shown once the first quarter of figures become available.
The economic crisis is revealed, above all, in the sudden decision of capitalists to forego planned investments in plant expansion or decision of big corporations to reduce sharply expenditures for new plant and equipment. It is as if all of a sudden the capitalist class, or at least large segments of it, has reached the conclusion that present capacity is more than ample to take care of existing demand. In this respect, the Eisenhower recession is typical of a classical capitalist depression, albeit it takes place in a different epoch and with the economy operating at very high levels.
The fact is, however, that this is a durable goods crisis. In virtually every such industry, idle capacity under capitalist conditions of production exists. In some cases, such as the railroads, the industry is permanently sick and an intelligent bourgeois would take the lead in favoring nationalization. The American bourgeoisie, however, especially its Republican wing, is so immersed in the fetishism of private capital that it will drive some of its leading elements to suicide rather than permit its state to socialize the losses of an important basic industry.
Having accelerated depreciation allowances over the last three years thereby borrowing from future capital accumulation, the bourgeoisie is in a quandary. Another “gimmick” of this nature is not in the cards, although watch for certain advocates of a tax cut to stress the “necessity to provide a stimulus for investment, for those who make jobs.” And with capital accumulation in a state of obvious decline, the only real remedy that the bourgeoisie has is to increase government expenditures, which again brings them face to face with the fetishism of private capital that dominates especially the more Republican sections of the bourgeoisie. Hence, the indecision of the Eisenhower administration, and its plaintive hope that by postponing a decision as to a tax cut or sizable increase in government expenditures, or both, the economy will suddenly right itself, thereby avoiding the necessity of a decision.

What about the built-in stabilizers? The answer is that despite much room for further improvement, above all the need to increase the amount of unemployment insurance and its duration, as well as other aspects of government – supported purchasing power, the built-in stabilizers have worked. An interesting and essentially correct article on this subject appears in the Review of the Week section The New York Times of March 23, 1958 by economics reporter Edwin L. Dale, Jr. Comparing the postwar slumps with that of 1929, aside from the fact that the decline in production was greater and more severe in 1929, Dale properly points out that the main difference has been that personal income, due to the built-in stabilizers, has declined much less. He puts it this way:
In 1929–30, personal income fell off about 8 per cent in the first seven months of the slump. This meant a sharp and severe drop in purchasing power.
Since that time there have been added unemployment compensation, other social security payments affecting mainly the aged and farm price supports. These “income cushions,” otherwise known as built-in stabilizers, have worked beautifully in the postwar slumps.
Compared with the 8 per cent decline in personal income in 1929–30, the decline in 1948–49’s first seven months was 3.1 per cent, while in 1953–54 it was 1.9 per cent and 1.3 per cent in 1957–58. This means that purchasing power in each postwar slump has fallen far less than production and considerably less than employment.
Of course, without the development of the Permanent War Economy, these built-in stabilizers would be helpless to stem the tide of recession. By themselves, unemployment insurance and other purchasing power supplements would be relatively powerless and, as in the case of Germany under the Weimar Republic, would simply be swept away by a desperate and impoverished middle class driven to the support of fascism.
That Dale is not so sure of the outlook can be seen from the conclusion of his article:
This postwar experience is an illustration of why the present situation is such a difficult one. True, the gods have once again provided a lucky break – the post-Sputnik increase in defense spending.
But there is real doubt that this will be enough. Hence the widespread belief that this recession is providing much the most severe test of whether modern American governments can and will take the right actions to cure successfully a serious slump. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)

Whose anti-recession program and for whom? The significant fact is that the Eisenhower administration, despite its being the creation of the fetishists of private capital, has already taken governmental action to try to stem the tide of recession. The government has lowered the rate of interest, through its control of the money markets, and attempted to ease credit. It is clear that these actions by themselves will not suffice. Certain foreign economic measures, as well as certain military expenditures, are presented as necessary to stimulate economic recovery, a tactic that riles the more orthodox Republicans. Gestures are being made in the direction of trying to persuade the states to extend the period of unemployment insurance benefits. All this is a far cry from the last Republican administration under Hoover. Naturally, the Democrats do not suffer nearly to the same degree from the fetishism of private capital, and hence (especially as an opposition political party) they are developing all kinds of proposals for large-scale public expenditures.
Since the most optimistic economic forecast merely hopes for a leveling off at the bottom during the second quarter and perhaps a slight upturn by the end of 1958, and since 1958 is an election year, it is quite apparent that there will be some type of tax cut in 1958, possibly a temporary one along the lines of the Committee for Economic Development proposal. Naturally, any flat percentage tax cut will be of greater benefit to the upper income groups than to the lower.
As always, when major economic policy questions become matters of practical politics, the class struggle has an ugly habit of intruding itself, to the despair of the “classless patriots.” A tax cut can have art immediate effect, but the question of “for whom?” is most relevant. Instead of the trade-union movement making pious representations to Eisenhower, it is time that labor developed a hard-hitting political-economic program, divorced from both the Democrats and Republicans. Among the planks that such a program ought to include are the following:

Developing the responsibility of society for the existence of unemployment and the support of the unemployed by raising benefits to a minimum of one-half of the previous wage and increasing the duration of unemployment insurance benefits from the present maximum of 26 weeks to 35 weeks. A program of this type should be financed by a capital levy (five per cent would be more than adequate on all aggregates of private capital in excess of one million dollars.
 
Nationalizing those industries whose output is essential to the public welfare and which can no longer be operated profitably under private capital. The starting point should be the railroads, with an immediate perspective of including all interstate transportation.
 
A large-scale public Works program, starting at $5 billion for the first year, to help build such institutions as schools, hospitals, roads etc.
 
Take the profit out of war industry by limiting profits to a maximum return of six per cent on invested capital. Nationalize those industries whose output is 100 per cent for military purposes.
 
Reducing Federal personal income taxes by increasing the dependency credit from $600 per dependent to $900, thereby eliminating the lower income groups from the burden of Federal income taxation, and making the existing burden more equitable than at present.

There are other measures that unionists and socialists could advocate. The important point, however is that the pressure of the unemployed and the rank and file on the trade union leadership is bound to increase. As these economic pressures develop and the longer the Eisenhower recession lasts, the more powerful will the pressures become, the sooner will become apparent to broad sections of the American working class that only through class political action can even the most elementary of economic demands be satisfied. The forthcoming political crisis will usher in a period of regroupment of political forces among all classes. Now is the time for labor to lay the foundations of independent political action!

If capitalism (i.e. advanced capitalism such as Britain and America) can through the exercise of non-economic democratic political pressures be reformed or so controlled in its operations that progressively the average standard of living is raised, the capacity of the productive forces increased, and some type of peace maintained, then what is the need for any type of socialist movement? This question insistently intrudes itself after a reading of John Strachey’s Contemporary Capitalism [1], despite the fact that at the end of his Acknowledgments, the author states: “Contemporary Capitalism is the first volume of a projected series of studies on the principles of democratic socialism.”
In fact, so many projected studies are indicated in the course of this one volume, that one must wish Strachey an exceptionally long life in order that he may set forth in writing his magnum opus. For, despite numerous disagreements that this writer has with many ideas expressed by Strachey, he is discussing questions of fundamental importance in a serious manner. Moreover, Strachey is aware that capitalism through a process of mutation, as he calls it, has changed fundamentally. In addition, while rejecting many of Marx’s principles, others are accepted. There are far too few analyses of contemporary society from the standpoint of democratic socialism to ignore Strachey because his economics are based on a curious amalgam of Marx and Keynes or because his politics appear to be acceptable to Bevan.
Contemporary capitalism, according to Strachey, has succeeded in raising the average standard of living’ because of trade union and leftist (democratic) pressures. Now, however, with the stage of oligopoly having been reached, there is a conflict between capitalism and democracy. “Capitalism in its latest stage, when it is progressively outgrowing the forms of ownership which were once appropriate to it, threatens to turn upon what was once its own political counterpart, namely, democracy.” (p. 344) It is the fact that capitalism through ever-increasing centralization constantly undermines the foundations of democracy that necessitates the struggle for socialism, according to Strachey It is his belief that only democratic socialists are the true fighters for democracy. The struggle for socialism is in reality the struggle for democracy. And, despite Strachey’s failure to distinguish clearly between democracy and democratic rights and between bourgeois and socialist democracy, it must be admitted that there is much truth in this dichotomy
If all classes in modern society before capitalist and Stalinist, were prepare to accept indefinitely the absence of democratic rights, then it is theoretically conceivable that a precarious international equilibrium could be maintained indefinitely. The apposition between capitalism and democracy is, in reality, the basic constructive theme of Strachey’s work. Among many quotable sentences of author’s thesis is the following
“Thus the continuance of effective democracy depends upon the protection of big capital’s control of the media of expression becoming absolute. And upon the continuance of effective democracy in two or three key societies of the world everything else will be found to depend.”
It is interesting to note Paul Homan’s evaluation of Strachey in a article in the June 1957 issue of The American Economic Review, Socialist Thought in Great Britain:
Strachey has now taken time out for reflective thought; his book is a restatement of his philosophical position and a misinterpretation of the process of social change. The title is somewhat misleading, because the book contains very little on the institutional characteristics of contemporary – economic organization – in fact, hardly more than a stereotype of oligopoly. What he does, essentially, is to set up two abstract creatures, capitalism and democracy, put them in the prize ring and let them fight it out, while he cheers in the corner of democracy. Capitalism is a sort of brutal monstrosity – the apotheosis of every inhumane, anti-social pursuit of private self-interest. Democracy is the champion of all generous-hearted efforts to attain general well-being and communal interest. The complete victory of democracy, would usher in socialism.
The professor’s sarcasm is not well taken for Strachey does have an analysis of the laws of motion of contemporary capitalism. Even if one disagrees with Strachey, which this reviewer does in certain fundamental respects that will be set forth below, the fact of the matter is that Strachey in thinking about important problems, which is more than most professors of economics permit themselves to do these days.
Strachey is also to be commended for realizing the importance of theory. He knows that capitalism has altered in certain of its basic characteristics in certain aspects of its functioning. He is not content with superficial description of these structural alterations, important though they may be. He wants to know “why.” He wants to be able to predict. In short, he seeks a theory of the latest stage of capitalism that will serve as a guide to action. Again, the fact that Strachey has exchanged his prewar Stalinist theories for his current amalgamation of Marx and Keynes, is hardly justification for rejecting him out of hand. In fact, how immeasurably superior is Strachey’s crude analysis of contemporary capitalism to the apologetics of bourgeois professors!
Strachey’s beginning is most encouraging, for he realizes that the wholesale modifications of the market that have occurred in recent years have led capitalism into a new stage. As he says,
“The first and decisive reason why an economy of large and few units exhibits new characteristics is because at a certain point in the increase of their size and decrease of their number, the managers of the remaining units begin to be able to affect prices instead of being exclusively affected by them. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of this transformation.” (p. 22, italics mine – T.N.V.)
While he uses different terms, Strachey is aware of the development of state monopoly capitalism and the era of administered prices that it has ushered in, and to a certain extent of its consequences. For example (p. 31):
“Accordingly, the State has come, in the advanced industrial nations, to feel that it must, and can, control such basic things as the pattern of the distribution of income between social classes and individual citizens, instead of leaving that pattern to the consequences of the play of the market.”
To examine each and every argument presented by Strachey, both those with which we concur as well as those with which we disagree, as well as to indicate significant areas of omission, would require a book rather than a review article. Suffice it to say that we believe Strachey to be fundamentally correct in his emphasis on the importance of prices now being administered in large measure, rather than determined competitively in the market. The “essence of the mutation,” as the author describes it, is (p. 39):
“the ability of the producers in some, but not in all, of the spheres of production to affect prices, instead of merely being affected by them ... Thus the ability to influence prices will inevitably sap the automatic, self-regulating character of the economy. It will consequently provoke and require more and more State intervention, and will lead to an intensified struggle for the now all-important levers of economic power which will be in the hands of the State ... Thus the characteristics of the latest stage of capitalism both make possible a much higher degree of social control and at the same time make such control imperative.”
his is insight and understanding of a high order.
Strachey devotes an important section of his book to value theory in economics. While he accepts Marx’s analysis of the centralization of capital, accepting as he does the term “oligopoly” from modern bourgeois economists, he rejects the labor theory of value as faulty and the theory of ever-increasing misery as Marx’s cardinal error. Strachey notes that from Ricardo on increasing disparities occurred between the price and value of many commodities. He feels that the labor theory of value has neglected to take into account the role of capital in the determination of prices. He states (p. 67):
“In other words, in real life not only man-hours of socially necessary labor but also a reward of some sort for capital entered into the determination of the points round which prices fluctuated.” (Italic in original)
Why Strachey is under the mistaken notion that Marx ignored the role of constant capital in the determination of the price of production and henceforth of market price is a complete mystery, since he merely makes the assertion, whereas Marx devoted large part of Volume III of Capital to an explanation of these interrelationships in connection with capitalist production as a whole. The skeptics are referred merely to Chapter of Volume III, although Kautsky will serve as a good introduction. Consider just the following two paragraphs from the first chapter on Cost, Price and and Profit (Capital, Kerr edition, Volume III, pp. 38–39)
However, the cost of this commodity to the capitalist, and the actual cost of this commodity, are two vastly different amounts. That portion of the value of the commodity which consists of surplus value does not cost the capitalist anything for the reason that it costs the laborer unpaid labor. But on the basis of capitalist production, the laborer plays the role of an ingredient of productive capital as soon as he has been incorporated in the process of production. Under these circumstances the capitalist poses as the actual producer of the commodity. For this reason the cost price of a commodity to the capitalist producer necessarily appears to him as the added cost of the commodity. If we designate the cost-price by k, we can transcribe the formula C=c+v+s into the formula C=k+s, that is to say, the value of the commodity is equal to the cost plus the surplus-value.
In this way the classification of the various values making good the values the capital consumed in the production of the commodity under the term one price expresses, on the one hand, the specific character of capitalist production. The capitalist cost of the commodity is measured by the expenditure of capital, while the actual cost of the commodity is measured by the expenditure of labor. The capitalist cost-price of the commodity, then, is a quantity different from its Value, or its actual cost-price. It is smaller than the value of the commodity. For since C=k+s, it is evident that k=C−s. On the other hand, the cost-price of a commodity is by no means a mere heading in capitalist bookkeeping. The actual existence of this portion of value continually exerts its practical influence in the actual production of the commodity, because it must be ever re-converted from its commodity-form, by way of the process of circulation, into the form of productive capital, so the cost-price of the commodity must always buy anew the elements of production consumed in its creation. (Italics in last sentence only mine. – T.N.V.)
How could the originator of the theory of the increasing organic composition of capital ignore the role of capital in the determination of price? Strachey ought to acquire his economics first-hand rather than through the courtesy of Joan Robinson. Implicitly, Strachey has fallen into the common bourgeois fallacy of “productivity of capital” as distinct from “productivity of labor.” And, if he thinks he can explain the origin of profit without recourse to the labor theory value, the bourgeoisie have been trying unsuccessfully for a hundred years to develop a theory that would both explain the origin of and justify profit, and at the same time correspond to reality. It might be added that the absence of a theory of profit creates numerous difficulties for Strachey, of which he seems to be totally unaware. He does understand that the accumulation of capital is the mainspring of capitalism (cf. Chapter 10), but why capital is accumulated or the laws governing its accumulation he doesn’t know because Mrs. Joan Robinson, his mentor, does not know.
It is sufficient to quote the following from p. 247):
“What in the world, then, determines the level of investment? Mrs. Joan Robinson, in a striking passage (from her The Accumulation of Capital), declares simply that we do not know! She writes: ‘... as to what governs the level at which it’ (investment) ‘gets itself established we know very little ...’”
Mrs. Robinson is here feeling the need of some kind of summa, transcending, although including, economics and laying the basis of an inclusive science of human society, a summa at which Marxism is at present the sole attempt. She is confronted with the fact that her analysis has led her to conclude that the true prime mover of a capitalist economy – the decision to invest – is determined by causes which are largely outside the scope of economic analysis.
The absence of a theory, even a much-abused Marxist theory, leads to all kinds of difficulties. Above all, if the government, through fear of the electorate or whatever motivation one wants, decides that slumps must be avoided at all costs, and that consequently the decisions to invest (i.e. the determination of the rate and mass of capital accumulation) cannot be left in the hands of profit-seeking private capitalists, and if further this can be achieved under bourgeois democracy or under a “labor” government, then why is there a need for socialism?
Intuitively, Strachey feels that he must reject the labor theory of value, not because he (Strachey) does not understand it, but because he wishes to attribute to Marx an “iron law” or subsistence theory of wages as an out-growth of the labor theory of value, and hence a failure to allow for increasing productivity of labor and consequently to deny the possibility and the actuality of increasing the national product and the average standard of living. The original sin of the labor theory of value thus becomes the source of the disastrous theory of ever-increasing misery.
Strachey puts it this way (p. 70): “Reckoning in terms of man-hours of socially necessary labor, the total national product is a given figure: all that can really be considered is its division between the social classes.” (Italics in original). Why this should be so when the amount of socially necessary labor required to produce the means of sustenance of labor or for labor to reproduce itself, i.e. the value of labor-power, is clearly dependent on the general historical and specific geographic environment, is not explained by Strachey. He merely asserts it. It is as if he never bothered to read Marx, for just reading the first few hundred pages of Volume I of Capital would have destroyed his entire fallacious attack on Marx’s development of the labor theory of value and surplus value.
Let Marx speak for himself (Volume I, pp. 189–190):
The value of labor-power is determined, as in the case of every other commodity, by the labor-time necessary for the production, and consequently also the reproduction, of this special article. So far as it has value, it represents no more than a definite quantity of the average labor of society incorporated in it. Labor-power exists only as a capacity, or power of the living individual. Its production consequently presupposes his existence. Given the individual, the production of labor-power consists in his reproduction of himself or his maintenance. For his maintenance he requires a given quantity of the means of subsistence ... the value of labor-power is the value of the means of subsistence necessary for the maintenance of the laborer ... His means of subsistence must therefore be sufficient to maintain him in his normal state as a laboring individual. His natural wants, such as food, clothing, fuel, and housing, vary according to the climatic and other physical conditions of his country. On the other hand, the number and extent of his so-called necessary wants, as also the modes of satisfying them, are themselves the product of historical development, and depend therefore to a great extent on the degree of civilization of a country, more particularly on the conditions under which, and consequently the habits and degree of comfort which, the class of free laborers has been formed. In contradistinction therefore to the case of other commodities, there enters into the determination of the value of labor-power a historical and moral element. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
In other words, since, by way of illustration, England is more civilized than, let us say, South Africa, and Strachey is accustomed to a greater degree of comfort than the South African miner, presumably the value Strachey’s means of subsistence (or of the British miner) exceeds that of the South African. And the value of the means of subsistence required for Mr. John Strachey today, or the British miner today, clearly is far greater than the value of the means of subsistence required for, say, Mr. Lytton Strachey some decades ago or that of a British miner a generation or more ago.
Marx was certainly guilty of many mistakes. He certainly didn’t foresee that capitalism would survive decades beyond the point where it clearly outlived its social usefulness. He also could not have been expected to have foreseen the Bolshevik revolution and the Stalinist counter-revolution. But surely before his basic thoughts are twisted and distorted, he has the right to assume that his critics (friendly they may be in the case of Strachey) will at least have made an effort to read and understand his works!
Strachey, however, is not concerned with what Marx wrote. He has a point to make:
“Therefore a subsistence theory of wages has always been, explicitly for Ricardo, explicitly for Marx, an essential part of labor theory of value. But wages have not remained at subsistence. Therefore one vitally important commodity namely, labor power, has not even tended to sell at its value. This formidable fact has driven a great hole, not only in the labor theory of but also in the associated Ricardian-Marxian diagram of what the distribution of the national product will be among the classes. It is the fact of rising real wages which has above all done the damage to the whole schema.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
It would be pretty difficult to crowd more errors into one short paragraph than Strachey does in the above. To be sure, the very next two sentences read (p. 71): “Nevertheless we shall find that it has by no means destroyed its importance as an elucidation of would happen unless tireless and drastic steps were taken to prevent. That, I repeat, is one of the reasons why it is still indispensable to master the labor theory of value.” (sic) It is a pity that Strachey has not followed his own advice, for one thing he cannot be accused of is having mastered the labor theory of value.
In passing, it should be obvious Strachey’s attributing to Marx on an “iron law” of wages requires him also to ignore the fact that Marx developed the theory of the class struggle. To summarize Marx’s central message, as does Strachey (p.102): “This is the statement that wages will in all capitalist societies tend towards what is for that time and phase a subsistence level” – which implies the influence of historical forces upon the determination of wages – and to deny the influence of the class struggle upon the level of wages, is to perpetrate an absurdity. To be sure, the forces of the class struggle cannot drive wages up to the point where for any length of time the profits of the capitalist class disappear without at the same time destroying capitalism.
To assert that Marx ignored the possibility that the productivity of labor could alter or increase is enough to make Marx turn over in his grave. Marx even devotes an entire chapter of Volume I of Capital to Changes of Magnitude in the Price of Labor-Power and in Surplus-Value (Chapter XVII), wherein he considers as the three decisive forces in determining these changes:
“(1) the length of the working day, or the extensive magnitude of labor; (2) the normal intensity of labor, its intensive magnitude, whereby a given quantity of labor is expended in a given time; (3) the productiveness of labor, whereby the same quantum of labor yields, in a given time, a greater or less quantum of product, dependent on the degree of development in the conditions of production.” (p. 569).
While Strachey pays homage to Marx for being the first to throw light on the business cycle, with his theory of crisis, Marx’s basic achievement was to analyze the conditions that led to, and to predict, the centralization of capital. His basic error was to assert the labor theory of value as a law rather than as a tendency. And the thing which destroys Marxism as a valid social theory is that from this labor theory of value, instead of merely asserting a tendency toward a polarization of classes, Marx predicted “ever-increasing misery” for the mass of the population. And it was this “ever-increasing misery” that would lead the masses to the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism.
Since, according to Strachey, in the advanced capitalist nations, the average standard of living has increased, there is no ever-increasing misery and, consequently, Marxism is outmoded as a scientific basis for socialism. There is, says Strachey, to be perfectly fair to Marx, atendency under capitalism for the entire increase in production to accrue to the benefit of the capitalist class,
“But this tendency has been overruled, in the advanced capitalist societies, but not elsewhere, by essentially non-economic forces, the existence of which Marx overlooked.” (Strachey’s emphasis, p. 129.)
What Marx meant by the increasing pauperization of labor (a thought which cannot be found in Capital, but only in The Communist Manifesto and certain propagandistic works) is not quite as simple as Strachey thinks. The evidence would seem to indicate that Marx based this prediction on his basic law of capital accumulation; namely, that an increase in capital accumulation leads to an increase in the industrial reserve army (unemployment). That this tendency still exists, even under the Permanent War Economy, we have shown in our original series of articles on the Permanent War Economy (cf. The New International, Vol. XVII). Nevertheless, as we have already demonstrated, the development of the Permanent War Economy stage of capitalism has altered Marx’s fundamental law of capitalist accumulation. To this extent, the doctrine of ever-increasing misery is in need of revision. Marx, so far as we can determine, never stated that the standards of living of the employed working class would deteriorate. He expected that the weight of the lazarus-layers of the working class (the unemployed) would carry down the average standard of living of the entire working class. Only in this sense is it proper to speak of ever-increasing misery.
And until the last decade, or until the development of the Permanent War Economy, it looked, as Strachey tacitly admits, that Marx was more or less correct. If, however, we are to admit that the average standard living of the employed working class is higher today than, let us say, it was two, three or four decades ago, we might try to include in this total evaluation, for surely it is part of total misery, the casualties of wartime, both in war and peace, and the psychological impact on want satisfactions on a world that lives under the constant threat of total annihilation. Moreover, as Strachey stresses, the major egalitarian trends that are truly significant occurred mainly during World War II.
As we stated at the outset, if capitalism can progressively raise average standards of living, and at the same time maintain a relatively peaceful international equilibrium, then it is still a viable historical system. We then need neither Marx nor Strachey but it is suggested that before everyone joins the capitalist band-wagon, we wait another decade, or even less to see if capitalism has really solved the problems of economic and political stability and progress.
The real significance of Strachey’s present volume is that he recognises that we have entered a new stage of capitalism, that capitalism no longer is self-regulating, that it is (and must in order to survive) be controlled. He gives Keynes great credit for recognizing that capitalism was no longer self-regulating. What he fails to see is that Keynes was the great bourgeois’ economist of the depression. His views on state intervention were acceptable only so long as the Great Depression prevailed. Once World War II and the ensuing Permanent War Economy developed, Keynes went into considerable decline, especially within American governmental circles.
It is interesting to note that Merchant’s View column in The New York Times of August 11, 1957 poses the question: “Can the national economy be controlled? It would appear that Government officials are experimenting with this problem in ways, perhaps, that appear to be baffling to the average business man.” Apparently, even The New York Times is not aware of the fact that the economy has been controlled for the past decade and more. The nature of the controls, their success and their impact on capitalism are necessarily subject of a future article. Suffice it to say, that we are of the opinion that under the Permanent War Economy, the capitalist state must control the economy. How long-lasting and successful this type of state intervention will be is a separate question. The permanent peace-and-prosperity school ought to wait a few years before they declare the present precarious equilibrium to be permanent.
After all, capitalist planning is not the same thing as socialist planning. Moreover, the capitalist world is in a curious dilemma with respect to the Stalinist sector of the world. Capitalism needs Stalinism to help maintain the existing international equilibrium and to provide a socially acceptable raison d’etre for the huge war outlays that alone provide the current decisive underpinnings of the entire economic system. Yet, the maintenance of Stalinism can lead to its strengthening, and the further whittling-away of the capitalist market, not to mention the ever-present danger that Stalinist political-military maneuvers will be successful and that, consequence, the physical dimensions of the capitalist world will be reduced still further.
Strachey would like to believe that a marriage of Keynesianism and social democracy can solve the problems of the world. In any event, he rejects any concept of the Permanent War Economy. He states (p. 295 et sequitur):
There is another and less palatable reason why it would be a great mistake to dismiss the Keynesian techniques as illusory. As we noted, those Marxians [Stalinists?] who are unable any longer to deny that capitalism in the nineteen-fifties is behaving very differently from what it did in the nineteen-thirties, explain that this is simply due to vast expenditures upon armaments ...
The case of these – mainly communist – critics is, briefly, as follows: “No doubt it is true that if a capitalist government supplements the activities of its profit-seeking entrepreneurs by itself spending or investing sufficiently massive sums, it can sustain the economy at a level of full employment. But a capitalist government will be intensely unwilling to do this for peaceful purposes ... Such (military) government expenditure fits into the generally aggressive policies of capitalist governments of the latest stage. It is this kind of government expenditure and this kind alone which the capitalist governments have undertaken on a scale sufficient to be economically significant since 1945.” ...
Such an explanation is a crude caricature of the complex realities of the contemporary situation ... The American economy had, it is true, suffered a very shallow depression in 1948–49 ... But the figures show incontrovertibly (they will be given in a later part of this study) that this depression was over and the progress of full employment had been resumed before the outbreak of the Korean war and long before the American rearmament program began.
It is a pity that Strachey does not submit his figures on the American situation in the current volume, for the future of capitalism depends on the United States, not on Britain. This provides us with an opportunity, without any elaborate explanation, to present our latest figures on the relationship of war outlays to total output in the United States during the past ten years of the Permanent War Economy.

While many of our prior actuals are herewith revised, the only important change is for the year 1947 where our present figures are considerably lower and the ratio of war outlays to total production is revised downwards from the previous 13.7% to the present 11.6%. It will be seen that in the year 1950, in the middle of which the Korean war broke out, the ratio declined below 10% to 9.8%. It should be remembered that at that point official unemployment statistics in the United States reached a total of 4,700,000. It was only the rapid increase in the ratio of war outlays to total production that prevented a serious unemployment situation from having far-reaching political effects; and, of course, it was the sharp rise in the war outlays ratio to a peak of almost 17% in 1952 and 1953 that reduced the level of unemployment to politically tolerable and relatively minor levels.
The gradual reduction and leveling off in war outlays in the post-Korean period has brought about a decline in the ratio of war outlays to total production. Attrition begins to set in. The big bourgeoisie demand a halt to inflation, or rather they use the concern of the working classes to prevent inflation as a device for getting the government to raise interest rates to place a squeeze on small and medium-size business. The “battle the budget” has all kinds of political motivations and overtones, but it is already clear that to the extent the government succeeds in halting inflation, the ratio of war outlays will continue to inch downward and unemployment will continue to creep upwards.
That the government is not entirely unaware of the economic implications of reductions in military outlays is graphically revealed by Marc Childs in his widely syndicated column of August 20, 1957, wherein he comments on “Jobs and Defense by stating, in part:
“The aviation industry is beginning to feel the effects of cutbacks in competing missile programs and in military aircraft production. The resulting unemployment when it is put together with pockets of joblessness, has raised the fear in the administration that the rising spiral of prices may eventually and sooner rather than later – bring deflation. As a result, Sherman Adams, the assistant to the President, instructed Clarence Randall, White House adviser on trade and economic affairs, to review every government cutback that might adversely affect a plant having more than 5,000 employees.
Randall is confident the economy can absorb this unemployment and continue at the present high level, but there are others not so optimistic”. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
We belong in the latter group, Strachey presumably would side with the optimists. In any case, it should already be clear (and, if not, it will become increasingly so) that contemporary capitalism, while a new stage (the Permanent War Economy), has achieved only the most precarious of equilibria, both domestically and internationally. The continual production of ever-increasing amounts of the means of consumption depends not only on constantly increasing production of the means of production, but on maintenance of the high level of production of the means of destruction. The impossibility of continuing to expand in all three departments of production will lead to a deteriorating economic situation and in the relatively near future to the beginnings of a first-rate political crisis.

As this article goes to press, the Wall Street Journal of Jan. 6 carries a lead story which strikingly confirms one of Mr. Oakes’ main points: the scope of the planning now going on for World War III. The Journal’s Washington correspondent writes:
The State Department is now considering a big post-armistice stockpile scheme. Under this proposal, which has now reached Secretary Condell Hull, the Government would accumulate a hoard of strategic materials, mostly from imports, over a period of some five years after the war. Goods like crude rubber and industrial diamonds would be stored above ground in warehouses; commodities such as tin and petroleum would be amassed below ground in vaults, mines and subterranean reservoirs.
Such a program, say its advocates, would provide a hedge against any future national ‘emergency’ (presumably, the next war). In addition, it would provide a balance for the large-scale American export program that is in prospect for world reconstruction, offering a way for debtor nations to repay public loans advanced by this country.
The Journal also reports that Vice-Chairman Batt of the War Production Board, speaking the same day in Chicago, urged adoption of a similar plan. Indicating the idea has had “more than casual official consideration”, Batt suggested it as “a novel means of approaching a balance in our foreign trade picture”.
This last argument shows the intimate connection that is coming to exist between war-making and economic stability. The riddle of how the impoverished, relatively backward rest of the world is going to pay for American exports of goods and capital, is neatly solved by importing vast quantities of raw materials and “sterilizing” them, much as the gold at Fort Knox is sterilized, by burying them in stockpiles withdrawn from the market. War and the prospect of war offer the means for performing this useful economic trick. In war modern capitalism has, as this article shows, an economic stabilizer better than pyramids, cathedrals and WPA rolled into one. – Ed. Politics, 1944.





AS World War II enters its climactic stage, it becomes increasingly clear that this is not the “War To End All Wars.” Already there have been many warnings of the “possibility of another war.” A growing cynicism is abroad concerning the prospects of durable peace. World War III is not only a distinct possibility, it is inevitable as long as the world’s social structure remains one of capitalist imperialism. As Dorothy Thompson puts it in her column of December 6, 1943, “All grand alliances (referring to the Roosevelt-Stalin-Churchill meeting), have existed only as long as it was necessary to win a war, or protect themselves against the aggressions of other powers. Once all enemies are defeated, the only potential enemies left are members of the grand alliance themselves.” In more scientific terms – the contradictions which led to this war have not been eliminated: if anything, they have been intensified.
More revealing than any theoretical analysis concerning its inevitability are the obvious preparations that are now being made for World War III. One may dismiss the psychological preparations, designed to condition the population to accept the inevitability of the next war, as too intangible to evaluate. One may shrug aside the political preparations, which are clearly inherent in the power politics now being played by the leaders of the United Nations, on the ground that this is realpolitik in a materialistic world. But it is impossible to overlook the unanimity with which the business community approves the maintenance of a large standing army, universal military service and an air force second to none as preconditions of America’s “security” in the post-war world. Disarmament, the utopian pipedream of Geneva, is to be abandoned as a slogan after this war – except for the conquered enemy.
Important as are the above more or less obvious types of preparation, currently concealed economic preparations are decisive. In the United States, this question is intimately bound up with the problems of reconversion. Much more is at stake than the question of what to do with the huge government-owned war plants (estimated at $20 billion by the end of the war). A plan for reconversion, no matter how loose and flexible, must be guided by some Indication of the type of post-war world that is desired. If war within the life of the next generation is a probability, then it must be planned for on the basis of the lessons learned from this war.
American imperialism, for example, has no intention of entering another war without adequate stockpiles of all critical and strategic military materials. And so we have Senate Bill 1582 (introduced early in December 1943 by Senator Scrugham of Nevada) whose stated purpose is:
“To assure an adequate supply of strategic and critical minerals for any future emergency by holding intact in the post-war period all stock piles surviving the present war owned by Government agencies and by necessary augmentation thereof primarily from domestic sources.”
The “future emergency” is subsequently defined as “a total war of three years’ duration, or of any equivalent emergency.”
In the case of copper, an article in the National Industrial Conference Board’s Economic Record (November 1943) reveals what would be involved. “As current usage of copper probably is at least 1.5 million tons annually, a supply for a three-year war, as proposed in the Scrugham bill, might require 4.5 million tons. This amount is nearly equal to the entire domestic output of new copper in the Thirties, or four years’ output at the peak mining rate of 1.07 million tons in 1942.” While the Scrugham bill leaves the question of cost open, it is estimated that the copper program alone would cost well above $1 billion. Clearly, economic preparations for World War III are beyond the stage of informal discussion.
The big question which all discussions of post-war economy try to answer is, of course: How to achieve full employment? The sad experiences following the last war, culminating in the world-wide depression of the 1930s, give the problem an understandable urgency. Public interest in the question is certainly more widespread than ever before. What better tribute to American advertising genius, or what more fitting commentary on the political and economic naivete of the American people, could there be than the $50,000 contest now being held by the Pabst Brewing Company, in commemoration of its 100th birthday, for the best plans to achieve full post-war employment?
There is an urgent political necessity for capitalism to achieve the abolition of unemployment. It is motivated by the inevitable slack in private investment in order to maintain the savings-investment equilibrium.
Assuming, therefore, that my major thesis is correct and that government balancing operations in the future will consist largely of socially sanctioned war outlays, the question arises: how will the future laws of capitalist accumulation differ from the past?
 
The Future Laws of Capitalist Accumulation
In the past, the dynamics of capital accumulation have caused a polarization of classes. (On the one hand, concentration of wealth in fewer and fewer monopoly capitalists; on the other, a steady increase in the size of the working class, both factory and non-factory, relative to other classes). The war, far from interrupting, has accentuated both these trends – in general, at the expense of the middle classes.
Although this law will still hold true in the epoch of Permanent War Economy, the increased State military outlays 1 as compared with prewar State expenditures) will have the effect of slowing up the rate of class polarization. This is due not so much to the different economic nature of these expenditures as to their political character. Their purpose, it must be remembered, is to stabilize the economy; i.e., by State intervention to freeze class relations and simultaneously the existing class structure. That is why the post-war size of the labor force and the national income will be considerably below that achieved during the war. Otherwise, the magnitude of post-war war outlays would be at a level so high as virtually to guarantee widespread political opposition on the part of the capitalist class.
The major revision that will have to be made in the Marxian analysis of capitalist accumulation is in the famous law, that an increase in capital means an increase in the industrial reserve army. If the Permanent War Economy succeeds in stabilizing the economy at a high level, unemployment will be eliminated, but only through employment in lines that are economically unproductive. Thus capitalist accumulation, instead of bringing about an increase in unemployment, will have as its major consequence a decline in the standard of living.
The decline in the standard of living will be similar in nature to that which is just beginning to take place in wartime. For example, until about the middle of 1942 it was possible for the developing American war economy to support a substantial increase in military production at the same time that a small, but significant, rise occurred in average civilian standards of living. This was due, for the most part, to the fact that in 1939 there was considerable underemployment of both men and resources. Once more or less full employment was attained, however, further increases in military production could only be achieved at the expense of the civilian sector of the economy. Most civilians have not yet felt the full impact of this development because of the accumulation of huge inventories of consumers’ goods in the hands of both merchants and consumers. As these inventories are depleted and as consumers’ durable goods wear out, the standard of living begins to decline noticeably. If the war continues throughout 1944, with no significant over-all cutbacks in military programs, the decline is apt to become precipitate.
The Permanent War Economy will operate much the same way. At first, of course, there may be a rise in the average standard of living if the levels of national income reached, are reasonably close to those now maintained and if, simultaneously, there is a sharp reduction in total miiltary out lays (inclusive of expenditures for “relief and rehabilitation”). Within a relatively short periGd, however, assuming that the economy is stabilized at the desired level with a minimum of unproductive governmental expenditures, the maintenance of economic equilibrium will require a steadily rising curve of military outlays. The decline in the average standard of living of the workers, at first relative, will then become absolute – particularly on a world scale as all na. tions adapt their internal economies to conform with the requirements of the new order based on an international Permanent War Economy. Naturally, the decline will not be a descending straight line; it will have its ups and downs, but the long-term trend will definitely be downward.
Three major assumptions are implicit in the above analysis. First, any significant increases in real national income or total product beyond the reconversion equilibrium level are excluded, due to the capitalist nature of production. This ties in with the reasons why continued accumulation of capital is necessary and why these additional increments of capitalist accumulation require more or less corresponding (socially acceptable) economically unproductive State expenditures. Second, while a portion of the State’s consumption of accumulated unpaid labor may take the form of public works, for reasons previously stated only a minor portion of such public works will be capable of raising the standard of living; and these will decline in importance as direct war outlays increase. Third, the possible effects of alternative fiscal policies (financing through difference:methods of taxation and borrowing ) to support the Permanent War Economy are excluded as not affecting the basic anlysis; although certain methods may markedly accelerate the inflationary process, while others may permit American entry into World War III without having experienced a violent inflation.
Capitalist society is forever seeking a “stable and safe” equilibrium – one which eliminates unemployment or, at least, reduces it to negligible proportions (“stable”); and one which is generally acceptable or, at least, politically workable (“safe”).
This is, of course, hardly a new problem. Instability has been a dominant characteristic of capitalism particularly since technological advances in industry have become marked, a matter of some fifty to one hundred years. It is only in recent years, however, especially since the Bolshevik Revolution plainly demonstrated that capitalism is a mortal society and can be succeeded by a different set of socio-economic institutions, that the problem has taken on a new urgency. Theoretical analysis indicates, and the observations of capitalists confirm, that capitalism would have great difficulty in surviving a depression comparable in severity to the recent one. This must be avoided at all costs, say the more enlightened members of the bourgeoisie, even if far-reaching structural changes are called for. True, this type of motivation has led to fascism and can easily do :so again. It is assumed, however, that the ruling class prefers to stave off the advent of fascism as long as possible, and that there is sufficient evidence to indicate that what I have termed “a Permanent War Economy” is coming to be a much more powerful stimulus than the increasingly-repeated question: “If we can employ everyone in wartime, why can’t we do as much in peacetime?” The fact is that the capitalist system cannot stand the strain of another siege of unemployment comparable. to 1930-1940. It does not require a far-seeing statesman to picture the revolutionary dynamite inherent in a situation where 10-12 million people are unemployed. And this is a conservative estimate of the size of post-war unemployment, if the traditional methods, such as those used after the last war, are followed this time.
The traditonial methods (consisting essentially of trying to restore the status quo ante bellum as rapidly as possible) will not be followed. Whether Roosevelt presides over the transition period or not, too much water has flowed under the bridge to permit an uncontrolled post-war inflation followed by a resounding and catastrophic depression. This much, at least, the better minds amongst the capitalists see. The State will have to intervene. It is a question of how much and in what form.
Here we encounter a problem in semantics. State intervention, as I shall show below, must take the form of maintaining a Permanent War Economy. What is a “war economy”? In an extreme sense, involving the reduction of civilian standards of living to the bedrock minimum in order to permit the maximum expansion of war output, we have not, of course, a war economy today. Russia, since the consolidation of Stalin’s dictatorship, and Germany, since the consolidation of Hitler’s dictatorship, both in “peace” and in the period of military hostilities, have experienced this type of war economy. They are the only countries in modern times to have experienced a “genuine” war economy, with the possible exception of Japan.
A war economy, as I use the term, is not determined by the expenditure of a given percentage of a nation’s resources and productive energies for military purposes. This determines only the kind of war economy – good, bad, or indifferent from the point of view of efficiency in war-making. The question of amount, however, is obviously relevant. At all times, there are some expenditures for war or “national defense.” How much must the government spend for, such purposes before we can say a war economy exists? In general terms, the problem can be answered as follows: a war economy exists whenever the government’s expenditures for war (or “national defense”) become a legitimate and significant end-purpose of economic activity. The degree of war expenditures required before such activities become significant obviously varies with the size and composition of the national income and the stock of accumulated capital. Nevertheless, the problem is capable of theoretical analysis and statistical measurement.
Until the present period, in America at least, only one legitimate end-purpose of economic activity has been recognized (in theory) ; namely, the satisfaction of human wants or, less euphemistically, the production and distribution of consumers’ goods and services. In wartime, of course, the legitimacy of war expenditures is never questioned, except by those few who question the progressiveness of the aims of the war. We are now being prepared, however, to recognize as a legitimate economic activity peacetime expenditures for war of a sizable nature. Hereinis lies the real importance of the psychological preparations now under way for World War III.
The state will have to spend for war purposes as much as is required to maintain a “stable and safe” equilibrium. As a result, unemployment will be a thing of the past. Barring the immediate outbreak of World War III – i.e., within five years of the end of World War II – the size of post-war war outlays is not significantly influenced by the potential utility of such expenditures for war-making. The decisive consideration is the level of employment that it is desired to maintain. Based on preliminary estimates of national income and capital accumulation in the interim period between World War II and World War III, the United States will achieve a Permanent War Economy through annual war expenditures of from $10-20 billion. Thus, the inner functioning of American capitalism will have been significantly altered, with profound consequences for all classes of society.
Why these “balancing” expenditures on the part of government must take the form of war outlays rather than public works requires a brief excursion into the past history of unpaid (surplus) labor.
 

The Problem of Unpaid Labor
The root of all economic difficulties in a class society lies in the fact that the ruling class appropriates (in accordance with the particular laws of motion of the given society) a portion of the labor expended by the working class or classes in the form of unpaid labor. The expropriation of this surplus labor presents its own set of problems; generally, however, they do not become crucial for the ruling class until the point is reached where it is necessary to pile up accumulations of unpaid labor. When these accumulations in turn beget new accumulations, then the stage of “primitive accumulation” (designed to build up the physical stock of the country for immediate consumption’ rose purposes) ceases and the stability of the society is threatened. The ruling class is impaled on the horns of a most deep serious dilemma: to allow these growing and mature accumulations to enter into economic circulation means to undermine the very foundations of existing society (in modern terms, depression); to reduce or eliminate these expanding accumulations of unpaid labor requires the ruling class or sections of it to commit hara-kiri (in modern terms, the capitalist must cease being a capitalist or enter into bankruptcy). The latter solution is like asking capitalists to accept a 3 per cent rate of profit, because if they make 6 or 10 per cent they upset the applecart and destroy the economic equilibrium. This is too perturbing a prospect; consequently, society as a whole must suffer the fate of economic disequilibrium unless the ruling class can bring its State to intervene in such a manner as to resolve this basic dilemma.
Since a class society can support on a relatively stabled it basis a certain amount of accumulated unpaid labor, the problem becomes one of immobilizing the excess. State intervention is required precisely because no individual member of the ruling class will voluntarily give up the opportunity to accumulate further wealth. The State, therefore, acts in the interests of all the members of the ruling class; the disposition of the excess accumulated unpaid labor is socially acceptable, and generally unnoticed by individual members of the ruling class.
Such, for example, was the role performed by pyramid-building in Ancient Egypt, the classic example of a stable economy based on the institution of chattel slavery. In feudal society, based on the accumulation of unpaid labor through the institution of serfdom, an analogous role was performed by the building of elaborate monasteries and shrines. These lavish medieval churches were far more than centers of worship and learning, or even than examples of conspicuous expenditure on the part of the ruling classes; they were an outlet for the unpaid labor of feudal society – an outlet which permitted a deadening economic equilibrium for centuries.
Capitalist society, of course, has had its own pyramids. These ostentatious expenditures, however, have failed to keep pace with the accumulation of capital. In recent times, the best examples have been the public works program of the New Deal and the road building program of Nazi Germany. Both have been accomplished through what is termed “deficit financing.” That is, the state has borrowed capital (accumulated surplus labor for which there is no opportunity for profitable private investment) and consumed it by employing a portion of the unemployed millions, thus achieving a rough but temporarily workable equilibrium.
While the Roosevelt and Hitler prewar “recovery” programs had much in common, there is an important difference. The latter was clearly a military program; all state expenditures were calculated with a direct military use in view. As such, they did not, for the most part, conflict with the direct interests of the capitalist class of Germany who wished to reserve for private capital all opportunities for profitable investment. In the United States, only a minor portion of the WPA and PWA programs possessed potential military usefulness. Consequently, as such expenditures increased, the opposition of the capitalist class rose (this was basically an economic development, although the psychological impetus afforded by recovery from the depths of depression undoubtedly aided the process). The more money the state spent, the more these expenditures circumscribed and limited the opportunity for profitable private investment. The New Deal was dead before the war; the war merely resuscitated its political expression and was, in reality, an historical necessity.
War expenditures accomplish the same purpose as public works, but in a manner that is decidedly more effective and more acceptable (from the capitalist point of view).
In this, capitalism is again borrowing from the techniques employed by the more static class societies of slavery and projects were officially counted among the unemployed. Today, however, not only are those engaged in producing the instruments of war considered to be gainfully employed; even those in the armed forces are classified as part of the employed labor force. It is only necessary to perpetuate into the post-war period this type of bookkeeping which classifies soldiers and munitions workers as “employed,” and then war (“national defense”) outlays become a legitimate end-purpose of economic activity; a Permanent War Economy is established and socially sanctioned; capitalist society is safely maintained – until the next war.
 
Capital Accumulation and State Intervention
Perhaps the most distinctive feature of capitalist society – in comparison with earlier class societies, and at the same time that which indicates its superiority over these earlier forms – is the rapidity with which wealth is accumulated. Alternating periods of rising and falling business activity have resulted and have come to be accepted as an inevitable and peculiarly capitalist feature of the accumulation of capital. This was, at least, the situation prior to World War II. To understand the basic laws of motion of capitalist society required the application of the fundamental Marxian concepts of the increasingly high organic composition of capital and the falling average rate of profit. With these tools Marx predicted, and one could analyze, the results of capitalist accumulation. The Marxian general law of capitalist accumulation may, for convenience, be expressed as two laws; namely, the inevitable tendencies toward the polarization of classes and the increase in unemployment.
Today, however, this analysis no longer holds good without certain modifications. The new element in the situation is clearly the fact that the entire present period (in the United States, beginning with the advent of the Roosevelt Administration) is one of increasing State intervention. New forces are set in motion and new laws or trends are discernible. The war both obscures and highlights these basic changes in the functioning of capitalism. The role of the State is obviously increased, but the conduct of the war gives rise to the illusion that this is a temporary affair. But the government cannot spend upwards of $300 billion on war expenditures, acquiring ownership of huge quantities of facilities, raw materials and fabricated goods, without having a profound and lasting effect on the body economic. How to dispose of an anticipated $75 billion of government assets at the end of the war is one of the more perplexing questions troubling the best minds among the bourgeoisie today.
If the Republicans are victorious in the 1944 elections, it is conceivable that they might try to restore the status quo ante bellum. Reversing an economic trend, however, is far more difficult than reversing a political trend. Destroying or immobilizing $75 billion of government assets is qualitatively a different proposition than the situation which existed at the end of World War I. It would be impossible to do this, and at the same time to maintain employment at a high level and to carry through the international plans of American imperialism. Any such Republican experiment will necessarily be short-lived. As for the Roosevelt Administration – it seems to be “sold” on the Keynesian proposition that public investment must take up the inevitable slack in private investment in order to maintain the savings-investment equilibrium.
Assuming, therefore, that my major thesis is correct and that government balancing operations in the future will consist largely of socially sanctioned war outlays, the question arises: how will the future laws of capitalist accumulation differ from the past?

The P.W.E in Action – A Look Ahead
How will the Permanent War Economy operate? Can it achieve the “stable and safe” equilibrium? It is possible to chart the major outlines of the functioning of the Permanent War Economy. The assumptions underlying this projection are listed below in outline form without any attempt at justification. They are grouped under three broad headings, as follows:
MILITARY

The European phase of World War II will end late in 1944.
 
The Asiatic phase of World War II will end late in 1945.
 
While some demobilization will take place with the defeat of Germany, the major transition will occur in fiscal 1946.
 
World War III will occur in 1960.


INTERNATIONAL

Conduct of world affairs in the interim period between World Wars II and III will be in the hands of the United States, Great Britain, and Russia, with American imperialism the dominant partner.
 
No successful proletarian revolution will take place.
 
Stalinism will successfully maintain itself in power in Russia.
 
A form of international “grossraumwirtschaft” will govern economic relations among the major economic regions of the world.
 
There will be a limited restoration of international trade based on direct and open State intervention.


DOMESTIC ECONOMY
(all dollar figures in 1943 prices)

The national income will vary within the limits of $120-150 billion, averaging around $135 billion.
 
There will be a gross national product of $140-180 billion, with an average of about $160 billion.
 
The dangerous margin of excess capital accumulations (over and above private capital formation) will run between $20–25 billion.
 
Private capital formation will reach about $10 billion in 1947, declining to approximately $5 billion in 1952 and thereafter levelling off at this rate.
 
Government war outlays will average about $15 billion, with probable limits of $10–20 billion the trend will be toward the upper limit as World War III approaches.
 
The national debt in 1946 will be close to $250 billion, increasing thereafter at an annual rate of $5–10 billion.
 
The employed labor force will be stabilized at about 50 million persons additions; due to the growth of population of working age are ignored, as it is unlikely that they will be substantial enough to alter the picture.
 
While it is probable that productivity of labor will increase, this factor is omitted from consideration as being too difficult to estimate and, in any case, unlikely to affect the basic analysis.
 
There will be a steady, but somewhat falling rate of interest.
 
The propensity to consume will remain fairly constant.
 
The rate of profit will be sustained at a level comparable to the best prewar years, its tendency to decline being offset by increasing State intervention and a relatively minor increase in the rate of surplus value.

On the basis of these assumptions, the table below of the movement of capital accumulation, government war outlays, the average standard of living and average real wages of the working class ander the Permanent War Economy follows logically.
1947 is chosen as the base year, for this is assumed to be the first “normal” post-war year. 1946 is considered as a year of transition. The concepts are presented in index ambers in order to show bask trends under the Permanent War Economy. Thus, according to the chart, the critical period will be 1934–1936. It Is at this time that the inherent contradictions of capitalism will begin to threaten seriously the newly-found economic stability, pushing society rapidly in the direction of World War





Minor divergences will not materially affect the validity of the assumptions. This is particularly true of assumptions 1–9 and 17–20, which are really political and economic generalizations. For example, the analysis still holds true even World War III should take place in 1965 or 1970, rather than, as predicted, in 1960. Assumptions 10–16 are of a an entirely different character. Here, substantial differences in magnitude might render the forecasts useless. But 12, 13, 14 and 16 require explanation. The others conform rather closely to most predictions now being made.
The figure stated in assumption 12, taken together with that stated in assumption 13, is only slightly above the estimate made by Professor Alvin Hansen (one of the outstanding authorities in this country on the theoretical aspects of investment policy) of $20–25 billion as the amount necessary to be invested in the post-war period. The level indicated have would be $30 billion, hardly a significant difference. Assumption 13 provides for private capital formation is perfectly consistent wih the hest prewar years starting with the history of capitalism since it entered the phase of permanent crisis.
Assumption 14 will appear very high to those who view the post-war situation in the same manner as the prewar situation. An interesting confirmation of the estimate made here appears in the October 1943 issue of the National Industrial Conference Board’s Economic Record in an article entitled Postwar Budget Prospects: 1945–1948:
 While all the figures for future years are necessarily speculative, they are particularly so for national defense expanditures in the post-war period. Armed forces numberimg 1 million lee would constitute a smaller number than are assionsed in some quarters. If the size of the armed services should be nearer to 2 million, expenditures of about $7 billion would seem to be more nearly the level of our peacetime defense expenditures than the $4 billion shown for l948. The natureand the extent of equipment that would be used by our armed forces in the post-war era could account for variations in expenditures of several billion dollars a year. (My italics – W.J.O.)
A total military establishment of 2 million appears to be conservative in the light of plans for occupation and policing forces, plus conscription of the youth. Equipment and supplies for this size military force should easily reach $10 billion. Stockpiling and other military outlays, direct and indirect, appear to be quite capable of raising the total to $20 billion, the upper limit in the assumption.
The average of current estimates regarding the probable size of the post-war labor force is about 55 million persons. Assumption 16, therefore, is considerably below prevailing estimates; for if the difference of 5 million were to constitute unemployment in any genuine sense of the term, it is obvious that the Permanent War Economy would not be, fulfilling its main function. 50 million is a more realistic figure than 55. It is higher than all prewar records, although it is some 13 million below the current peak o about 63 million (which includes those in the armed forces) The translation of those in the armed forces into active members of the labor force, is subject to shrinkage which depending on battle casualties and related factors, should run between 1 and 2 millions. Net retirements, due to the excess of over-age people leaving jobs as compared with new entrants, should be close to 3 million. The balance of 8 million represents women who are temporary war worker and are expected to leave the employed labor force once the war is over. This figure includes current child labor and is therefore not much higher than generally accepted “guess-timates.”
The assumptions upon which the operations of the Permanent War Economy are predicated thus appear to be realistic. Among the many problems which will remainare two outstanding and closely related ones: can class relations be frozen, and can disastrous inflation be prevented. Each requires a separate article, to be adequately discussed. The first, as I have indicated, is directly related to the pre cess of capitalist accumulation in the post-war period.
It depends not only on many political factors but on severa economic ones, the most important of which is clearly the question of inflation.
It is not my belief that the Permanent War Economy wit provide an enduring solution for capitalism. But it can work for the period under consideration; and there is like wise no reason why appropriate fiscal policies (from the point of view of the capitalists, which means anti-working class in essence) will not be successful in preventing out right inflation. The national debt, astronomical as it mar seem, presents no serious problem. Assuming an annual interest burden of $7 billion, a very generous estimate, this will easily be covered out of current tax receipts. It is the type, as well as the amount, of taxes to be levied that will constitute one of the major areas of political and class conflict. The question is made still more acute by the fact that inflation appears to offer the bourgeoisie an easy way out to unload the cost of the war onto the backs of the working masses of the population. A policy of this kind however, cannot be drifted into; it must be adopted consciously. If the die is now, or soon to be, cast in favor of deliberate and uncontrolled inflation, this can only mean that the decisive section of the ruling class is determined to establish fascism as soon as possible. I see no evidence at present, to warrant this belief although, of course, there are many similarities between fascism and the Permanent War Economy. The danger of inflation is not diminished by a Permanent War Economy; on the contrary, it is steadily increased. But it seems more probable that the inflation-fascism sequence is a contender for a prime place on the agenda after World War III than in the post-World War II period.
 
Labor’s Responsibility
It is not likely that the above analysis, necessarily presented in sketchy, outline form, will meet with any enthusiastic reception. For one thing, it runs counter to all currently organized and clearly defined bodies of political thought. Orthodox Marxists (Trotskyists) have convinced themselves that only a successful proletarian revolution can end this war; otherwise fascism will rule the post-war world. New Dealers want to restore “free competition” and make capitalism humane; the only practical note amidst their absurdities is the attempt to win a fourth term for Roosevelt. Social Democrats are still for socialism in theory and capitalism in practice. In fact, all capitalist (and Stalinist) political thought will deny the possibility of a Permanent War Economy, although they will support measures leading toward its establishment.
Moreover, the imagination, courage and capacity of the human mind to project itself forward in an hour of deep social crisis and deal with reality instead of illusion has not been a very noticeable characteristic of the human species. Nevertheless, this war, which has already destroyed so many cherished illusions, will destroy many more before it is consigned to the history texts. The drift of events is toward a Permanent War Economy. What better solution has capitalism to offer? And what likelihood of an anti-capitalist solution is there at present? What may now seem fantastic to many will, as the present war draws to a close, appear to be obvious as the evidence piles up.
Upon the shoulders of the labor movement rests the real responsibility for preventing World War III. This universally-approved objective can never be achieved by the Roosevelts, Churchills, Stalins, or Chiang Kai-Sheks of this or the next decade. For the labor movement, especially its socialist-minded sector, to stand a chance to prevent the atomization of society as a result of repeated wars requires much closer and more realistic study of what is actually happening in the world today than has yet been evidenced. The basic strategic aim of socialism as the only rational alternative to capitalism needs no revision except that of modernization. It is in the field of tactics that substantial revisions are needed. A declining standard of living under a Permanent War Economy cannot be successfully fought by a labor movement whose most powerful organizations are trade unions, no matter how powerful these may be. The important battle areas will be abstruse (to the masses) economic questions, such as the size and composition of the Federal budget, taxation and fiscal policy, investment alternatives, and the like, rather than wages, profits and working conditions for specific industries or factories. These latter will still be important, to be sure, but they will largely be determined by the decisions affecting the former. This points to the necessity not only of widespread mass economic education, but of the vital need for an independent political Party of labor. Only a labor party, independent of capitalist political machines, and based upon trade unionists, is capable of coping with the problems of living under a permanent war economy.




“DEPRESSION IS A REAL FEAR for many of us. It has already touched the farmers. It may touch others in the months ahead.” Thus spoke Adlai E. Stevenson, leader of the “loyal opposition,” in his Philadelphia speech of December 12th. The atmosphere of anxiety appears to reach far beyond the farmers, extending from Main Street to Wall Street. Most people, including those in government, are worried about the economic outlook.
That there is some basis for these fears can be seen in the most recent report of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers. The report for December receives the headline in the New York Times of December 15th, November Business Activity Shows First Dip From 1952. Factory output and earnings were off. The average work-week dipped below forty hours, with the 39.9-hour average being the lowest for any November in the last four years. While there were some favorable factors, unemployment increased by 266,000.
If one examines the basic national income data, as published by the Department of Commerce in the November issue of the Survey of Current Business, it becomes apparent that a mild recession started in the third quarter of 1953. Gross national product declined from a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $372.4 billion in the second quarter of 1953 to $369 billion in the third quarter. Since personal consumption expenditures and government purchases of goods and services increased, although almost imperceptibly, gross private domestic investment accounts for the decline. For all practical purposes, the entire story is told by the reduction in the change in business inventories from an annual rate of $8.8 billion in the second quarter to one of $4.5 billion in the third quarter.
In some quarters, it is fashionable to attribute the present recession to a mere “inventory adjustment” – presumably of no consequence. The November 1953 Survey of Current Business has this to say about the subject:
“The bulk of the advance in inventories since the strike-affected third quarter of last year has been in durable goods. Additions to durable goods inventories have reflected substantial replenishments that followed the widespread imbalances caused by the steel shortages as well as the subsequent buildup in many hard good lines, such as automobiles, which were carrying unusually low inventories in the earlier period of production controls. More recently, some backing up of stocks because of lower than expected sales also have been a contributing factor, affecting particularly third, quarter inventories in retail trade.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
This is a most curious attempt to evade facing reality – and in a publication that is hardly read by the general public. The statement regarding inventories of automobiles is sheer fiction, as retail sales of automobiles have been declining. It has been obvious for several months that production of automobiles has been exceeding sales. The increase in inventories has nothing to do with production restrictions that existed last year or the year before. Not only have retail sales in general been lower than expected, but they are currently running five to ten per cent under last year.
The decline in retail sales naturally begins to have an impact at the factory level. Factory sales of all motor vehicles, for example, reached a 1953 peak of 723,532 in April. After declines of eighty and sixty thousand vehicles in May and June, factory sales of motor vehicles still totalled 705,132 in July. In August, the figure was down to 615,382 and in September to 573,688. It is estimated that production of motor vehicles for 1953 may exceed retail sales by several hundred thousand units.
New orders are, of course, one of the most sensitive barometers of business conditions. In view of the softening throughout the economy, it is not surprising that net orders declined from a peak of $25.7 billion in April 1953 to $22.4 billion in September, the latest month available. This is a decline of twelve per cent, and must be regarded as significant in any appraisal of the economy.
Ninety per cent of the decline in recent months in new orders is to be found in the durable goods industries – total net new orders for all durable goods industries declining from $12.6 billion in April 1953 to $9.6 billion in September. Since the bulk of this decline occurs in transportation equipment, including motor vehicles and parts, the crisis in consumer durables, centering in the automobile industry, is evident.
At the same time, there has been some increase in the number of industrial and commercial failures, although not as yet of an alarming nature. More significant has been a pronounced decline in the number of new business incorporations. From a 1953 peak of 9,659 in March, the number of new incorporations throughout the country declined to 7,433 in September – a drop of almost 25 per cent. As the hucksters on Madison Avenue put it, “The economy has become more competitive.”
 
AN INTERESTING APPRAISAL of the economic outlook is contained in the New York Times of December 20th, in the column, The Merchant’s Point of View, by William M. Freeman:
The population is just over 160,000,000 and is continuing to go up. While the baby crop is dropping, there are more toddlers and more elderly persons, which means a heavier load on the more or less static middle group. The number of marriages is decreasing. Demand for new homes is easing, a dip that is accentuated by higher prices. Materials prices also are weaker, so that prices of homes and major appliances should turn downward in due course.
Sales of furniture, major appliances and a host of other items are closely linked to the housing trend. The television receiver, which increases living room usage, traffic, wear, destruction and replacement, is helping a bit in furniture volume, as is the continuing trend to outdoor living, sparked by the flight from the cities to a semi-suburban way of life.
Employment is dipping steadily, with business activity showing its first minus signs for the year in November. Some 1,428,000 persons were jobless in November, 2.3 per cent of the labor force; this was the sharpest rise recorded in the year.
All of these factors add up to a downward readjustment, now accelerating. with industrial production off 6 per cent from the peak in March. The Federal Reserve Board’s index stood at the close of November at 228, based on the 1935–39 average taken as 100, against the March figure of 243.
Inventories are heavy in most lines. Retail sales are trailing 1952 volume, but the year as a whole, with attractive prices on desired items rather than on ‘lemons,’ aided by special promotions backed by heavy advertising, should finish between 1 and 2 per cent ahead of last year ...
In a word, there is a marked softening evident throughout most of the economy. In almost every market, supply now exceeds demand. The term, “buyers’ market,” is used more and more frequently, and is an apt description of the situation in the economy as a whole. While there is reason to fear depression, there is no reason for panic to prevail. Many new products, and improvements in old products, are being put on the market. Business volume is still at a very high level. Freeman concludes his column, quoted above, as follows:
It is factors such as this, the product of the engineer, the artist, the production man and the planner, that distort computations. There is no question of a readjustment coming up, aside from anything we scare ourselves into, as a result of the rapid post-Korea expansion and the existence of surpluses in many lines that must be worked off before production rates can be resumed.
The outlook, therefore, is for sharply intensified competition, with a marked increase in competitive selling in every aspect of the economy. But, and here’s something that’s been ignored: The slide-off, in the works since mid-year, is from record levels. It seems very likely, therefore, that the year ahead will come close to the 1952 figure, which was very near the record. And the country’s inventive genius can effect this outlook only one way – upward.
Ignoring the propaganda content in the phrase, “inventive genius,” there has been as we pointed out in The Permanent War Economy Under Eisenhower (cf. March–April 1953 issue of The New International, p. 97) an enormous amount of capital accumulation since the end of World War II. Productive capacity, therefore, is still increasing at a goodly rate and there is, as yet, no sign of any significant downturn in the accumulation of capital, as can be seen from the following tabulation covering the last seven quarters.

It is true that the second quarter of 1953 represents the peak in capital accumulation, both gross and net. It is much too early, however, to draw conclusions as to whether the downturn in the third quarter will turn out to be mainly an inventory adjustment, or whether it presages a characteristic decline in the traditional cycle of capital accumulation. At the moment, of course, the figures for gross private investment in producers’ durable equipment (new plant and equipment) do not show any recession characteristics. At seasonally adjusted annual rates, the estimates for producers’ durable equipment for the last seven quarters are:

Obviously, a sizable portion of the gross investment in plant and equipment represents a net increase in productive capacity. Contained in these figures are the seeds of a typical capitalist crisis of overproduction. But the seeds have not yet germinated. For the time being, the accumulation of real capital keeps pace with the increase in total output. Any drastic curtailment in capital formation would herald the approach of deep-seated capitalist crisis. Under the Permanent War Economy, however, such a development is virtually excluded.
And yet, the signs of atrophy, alluded to in The Permanent War Economy Under Eisenhower, multiply. The investment figures cited above are not without interest. They show that capital is apparently being consumed at a faster rate than gross investment increases. Consequently, the increase in net investment is not keeping pace with the increase in gross investment. What seems to be happening is that the increasingly high organic composition of capital results in a larger proportion of output going toward the replacement of constant capital. As we pointed out in the original series of articles, such a trend must necessarily have an adverse impact on the rate of surplus value, and therefore ultimately on the rate of profit. All the evidence points to a reduced rate of profit in 1954. From this, it does not follow, however, that a capitalist crisis is at hand.
Parenthetically, it should be observed that as the figures for capital consumption allowances rise, the use of gross national product data is fraught with increasing danger and a larger margin of error. Increasing rates of depreciation and obsolescence may well be symptomatic of rising rates of productivity. They can also give rise to new types of capitalist contradictions and new problems which capitalist state intervention, far from solving, actually accentuates. When estimates of capital consumption reach eight per cent of gross output, as they currently do, it is no longer a problem solely for accountants. Such figures have an economic and political impact. Once five-year amortization of “defense” plants and the excess profits tax are eliminated, it remains to be seen whether “normal” capitalist incentives will be sufficient to maintain the required high rate of investment that a high level equilibrium in the economy apparently requires.
Again, it is too early to tell, but the fact remains that between the second and third quarter of 1953 personal savings, as estimated by the Department of Commerce, increased from an annual rate of $17.2 billion to an annual rate of $18.8 billion. An increase of nine per cent in the amount of personal savings would appear to be a very sizable figure, but in view of the dubious residual method by which Commerce derives these estimates too much importance should not be attached to this change. Much larger quarterly changes have been recorded in the recent past, without any undue economic significance. But it is possible that the apparent increase in the amount of personal savings could reflect growing caution on the part of the average consumer as the fear of depression grows.
The major factor in tempering any unduly pessimistic forecast of the economic outlook necessarily remains the size, composition and trend of war outlays. In analyzing these data, it will be helpful to have the quarterly figures as presented in the following tabulation.

The net national product figures are derived from Commerce estimates of gross national product and national income. The concepts of war outlays, direct and indirect, remain as heretofore, with the derivation of the figures following the explanation on pages 94–95 of the March–April 1953 issue of The New International. The margin of error in these quarterly estimates cannot be significantly greater than in the annual figures presented in prior articles.
The ratio of war outlays to total output, the prime mover in this period of capitalism, has reached a fairly even plateau. During the entire period under review, the extreme variation is to be found between the 16,7 per cent of the first quarter of 1952 and the 17.8 per cent of the second quarter of the same year. This represents a variation of but six per cent at the peak, which is well within the margin of error in the underlying data. A war outlays ratio of 17 per cent is significant, but as it continues at the same level over a period of months, and then of years, it begins to lose some of its impact. The same ratio can no longer sustain the same high level of employment, production and profits.
Of course, changes of one-half of one per cent in the ratio, in either direction, may well have a noticeable impact on the equilibrium level, but in their totality such changes are more than offset by the atrophy that begins to set in. The weakening of the impact of war outlays tends to create all sorts of illusions. At one extreme is the notion that war outlays never had anything to do with the high level of activity; hence, it makes little difference if they do decline in the future, as there will be many offsets and “prosperity” will continue. At the other extreme is the fear that the bottom will drop out of the economy, as if Washington had a completely free hand in determining the level and ratio of war outlays; this point of view, of course, fails to realize that American imperialism had and still has valid political, as well as economic, motives for the adoption of the Permanent War Economy.
What has happened, of course, aside from the stretch-out in the “Defense” program begun under Truman, and the truce in the Korean war, is that direct war outlays have kept pace with, and been responsible in large measure for, the rise in total output. Indirect war outlays, however, have leveled off and now tend to decline. The reduction in foreign economic aid, a notable difference in Republican policy as contrasted with that of the Democrats, is chiefly responsible for the falling off in indirect war outlays. If, on top of this, direct war outlays are reduced by $5 billion, as the Republicans now threaten, the consequences could be serious. How much the Eisenhower Administration will reduce direct war outlays, remains to be seen.
They may find that it is easier to eliminate agricultural price supports and such “un-American” controls than to reduce the manpower of the armed forces and to convince the American bourgeoisie as a whole that military reliance can be placed on atomic weapons to achieve the necessary degree of safety, as well as to provide the necessary implementation for foreign policy. To be sure, if the plan is to abandon Western Europe to Stalinism, then temporarily a sharp reduction in direct military outlays may be achieved. Granted that the bulk of isolationist tendencies are concentrated within Republican ranks, it is still inconceivable that the Eisenhower Administration is planning to abandon Europe to the tender mercies of Stalinist imperialism. Without such a major change in policy, or the working out of a basic agreement with Stalinist imperialism, the political basis for any sharp reduction in war outlays remains absent. And as long as war outlays remain at 17 per cent of total output, there cannot be a serious depression.
 
ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING EXPONENTS of the view that war outlays have had nothing to do with sustaining a high level of economic activity is W. Woytinsky. Writing in the New Leader of December 7, 1953, Woytinsky states:
“My forecast here is based on the belief that the prosperity enjoyed by this country in recent years has not been a Korean War prosperity. It has been rather a period of healthy growth of a vigorous and dynamic economic system, with the benefits of growth widely though unevenly distributed among broad groups of the population.”
To label the post-World War II expansion of American capitalism “a period of healthy growth” betrays a singularly acute lack of understanding of the world in which we live.
The main prop in Woytinsky’s unique approach to the economic outlook is contained in a paragraph from his prognosis of a year ago (cf. the New Leader, December 8, 1952):
“The liquidation of the defense program would mean reorientation of economic activities and a brief spell of hesitation, but by no means a contraction in the total volume of employment and production. The problem will be of the same nature as the demobilization after World War II, but on a much smaller scale. The last demobilization – in the sense of complete reorientation of our economy and readjustment of men released from the armed forces – took two years, and at no time did unemployment rise to 3 million in the period of readjustment.
The liquidation of the present defense and rearmament program would take much less time and cause much less frictional unemployment.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Of course, there will be no liquidation of the defense program, although some slight reduction in the magnitude of war outlays is not excluded. The adjustment problem, however, in the event of a reduction in war outlays is not only not the same. It is entirely different. At the end of World War II, the ratio of war outlays to total output exceeded 40 per cent. A swift decline took place to the ten per cent level, but the reduction in the production of means of production and consumption during the war meant that there was room for increase in these traditional goals of economic output once the sharp decline began in the production of means of destruction. Hence, there could be no serious depression immediately following the end of World War II. It is obvious that the present situation differs markedly from that which prevailed eight years ago. The current increase (from 1950–1953) in the output of means of destruction has not only riot been accompanied by a decrease in the output of means of production and means of consumption, but has actually witnessed an increase in the production of both capital and consumers’ goods.
Woytinsky possesses a remarkably simplistic and mechanical view of the economy, where a drop in one sector must be offset by increases in other sectors. In his 1952 article, quoted above, he asserts:
“Whatever goes to the military sector is taken from civilian consumption and capital formation. Whatever is released from the military sector returns to the civilian.”
Here we have a modern version of Adam Smith’s “unseen hand” that automatically takes care of the economy and all supporters of capitalism, but somehow fails to eliminate the “unemployment” sector.
An effective reply to Woytinsky was given by Seymour E. Harris in the New Leader of December 22, 1952, when he wrote:
“I find serious gaps in Dr. Woytinsky’s crystal-gazing. He says not a word about the tremendous investment since 1945. Our capital plant has expanded by 50–60 per cent (in real terms) since 1945. These gains are far beyond what prevailed in the inflationary Twenties. Yet Dr. Woytinsky writes as though, when the Government cuts its spending on armament by 20 billion dollars or so, part of the slack will be taken up by business. A more realistic view would be that the decline of Government spending would aggravate a decline in investment.”
Harris has put his finger on one of the central problems when he focuses on investment. He would also appear to be more realistic than Woytinsky in appraising the possibilities of government investments as offsets to declining war outlays. He states:
“It is this failure to suggest the alternatives that leaves me cool to Dr. Woytinsky’s astrology. His assumption of gains in investment seems unrealistic. His suggestion that Government will substitute investments of various kinds for military outlays also is unsupportable. A Democratic regime, supported by an ideology favorable to deficit financing, was not prepared after twenty years of rule to present a catalogue of investment adequate to do this job; and even if it had, it was confronted with strong opposition. Does Dr. Woytinsky mean to imply that the Republican Administration will be more disposed to plan for Government intervention when military expenditures fall and thus to fill the gap? It is possible, but certainly not likely.”
After pointing out that tax reduction is the more likely response to a cut in military outlays, and that tax reduction can have only a limited stimulus on demand. Harris concludes his refutation of Woytinsky:
“In summary, the signs point to a business recession in 1953 or 1954 – unless the war is extended. Dr. Woytinsky does not seem concerned over the possibility of adequate demand even if the whole military program is scrapped. He seems to believe that tax reduction and pent-up demand (compared by Dr. Woytinsky with the 1946 situation, and wrongly so) will solve our problem.”
Woytinsky returns to the economic hustings in his Economic Forecast for 1954, the title of his current article, quoted above, with a modification of his “changing sector” theory of the previous year. This might be called the “excess fat” theory, for he states:
“Our economy has accumulated such an amount of fat and muscle that it is hard to visualize its temporary contraction to a level that would spell out a ‘mild recession’ such as contemplated a year ago. This is said even while giving full weight to at least four problems which have often been mentioned as presaging a downturn. These are the position of the farmer, possible cuts in defense expenditures, a new economic philosophy in Washington, and possible reorientation of foreign-trade policy.”
Apparently, Woytinsky is not up on the latest dietary theories, for the “excess fat” represents as much of a danger as it does a cushion. Moreover, the extra weight would seem to consist mainly of “fat” rather than of “muscle.” Unemployment caused by declines in production from peak levels is just as real to those who are placed in the category of surplus labor as unemployment that develops from a lower production base. An increase of unemployment from one million to five million may not be as catastrophic in its impact as an increase from five million to nine million, but it is still serious and would certainly constitute at least a “mild” recession.
“The cut in defense expenditures as a source of contraction of purchasing power is, to a large extent,” according to Woytinsky, “a bogey man in the modern folklore of business forecasting. The cut of $5 billion in the requested appropriation does not imply that Government purchases in 1954 will be substantially reduced in comparison with 1953. The real volume of purchases will depend partly on changes in prices, partly on political developments which may call for new appropriations. As things look now, total Government expenditures may decline by $2 billion or $3 billion or increase by a similar or larger amount.”
In other words, Woytinsky is not especially concerned with a projected cut in war outlays – not because “prosperity is independent of the level of war outlays” as was his position a year ago, but because there won’t be a real cut in 1954. Besides, if there is a real cut, there is plenty of fat, so it won’t be serious. And, if the “excess fat” theory doesn’t work, then there may be “political developments which may call for new appropriations.” If war expenditures are not present in sufficient volume to prevent a recession, then there will be other types of government expenditures. Woytinsky is convinced that the economy will continue to expand in 1954, and he will find a theory to support that point of view, even if he has to alter or repudiate his earlier theories.
 
MEANWHILE, THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION is displaying signs of worry about the economic outlook. Some months ago, apparently fearful that official indexes would be too slow in heralding a downswing, it was announced that economic “watchdogs” were being appointed in various areas. Apparently, certain officials in large corporations, and perhaps even in trade unions, were to be deputized with titles which gave them the responsibility of notifying Washington immediately upon learning that a factory planned to curtail or cease production, or that overtime was being reduced. What, if anything, has been done to implement this rather novel idea is not known to us, but the new line of the Administration is presumably authoritatively revealed in a front-page article in the New York Times of December 21, 1953. Under the headline, U.S. Acting to Meet Any Slide in Business, Washington reporter Joseph A. Loftus writes:
The Administration is facing up to the possibility of a 1954 slide in business and employment. At the same time, Administration sources express confidence that the outlook now is good.
A realistic view of economic conditions, and some of the available remedies, if any are needed, will be discussed in the annual report of the Council of Economic Advisers and in the President’s Economic Message to Congress next month.
While these reports are expected to deal candidly with the situation, they are not expected to blueprint anti-recession plans. The reason no firm, plans can be laid, according to informed official opinion, is that nobody can say in advance what the economic ailment, if any, will be, and therefore none of the economic doctors can prescribe a specific medicine. [Sic!]
Rather, a line of thinking will be offered, and the standbys that are available, or should be made available, to counter a recession will be discussed.
Stimulation of private capital will be accented, it is understood. One form of business encouragement would be the enactment of lease-purchase legislation under which local money would be used to build needed Federal buildings throughout the country. The Federal Government would pay for the buildings in rent over fifteen to twenty-five year periods and become the eventual owner.
A $15,000,000,000 Federal public works list, some of it blueprinted, also is available as a business stimulant, if necessary.
Another great source of potential economic activity is state and local works programs. Many state and local projects have been long deferred, although this type of construction has shown a substantial rise lately.
Consideration of anti-recession plans is dictated by prudence and a recognition that some business men, although perhaps a minority, and some of our Allies, are a bit jittery about business prospects.
Officials say there is evidence that the country is gong through an economic adjustment, possibly because of a reduction being made in business inventories, as in 1949.
None of the economic indicators shows a severe readjustment now, or foreshadows one in the coming year, except as psychological behavior might make it so, it is held. The factors militating against a serious slide in business are said to include these: Government spending will continue high ... spending for new plant and equipment in the first quarter of 1954 reveals a total almost as high as in the current quarter ... Employment and personal income are extraordinarily high; so are personal savings ...
Dr. Arthur F. Burns, chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, told the American Conference on Economic Security, Nov. 7, that the council already had gone ‘some distance’ in preparing recommendations to cushion an economic decline.
He said that the standbys under study included measures to ease home building and repairs, further changes in the tax program, revisions in the unemployment insurance system and, if necessary, large scale public works. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
There then follows a list of construction projects that could be taken off the shelf. It is impossible, however, to escape the conclusion that the mountain has labored and brought forth a mouse. The “anti-recession” plans of the Eisenhower Administration are reminiscent of those of the Hoover Administration. They consist chiefly of issuing optimistic statements, reinforced by those of their big business partners, that everything is fine and will so remain in this best of all possible worlds.
As Stevenson put it in his December 12th speech:
“... I don’t know for certain whether we can talk our way into a business recession. But I do know that talk alone won’t prevent a depression or cure it either. The Republicans cleared up that question for us some twenty years ago.”
 
THE FEAR OF DEPRESSION IS REAL and tangible. It is not borne solely out of long memories or out of political malice. It has its roots in the softening that is clearly taking place throughout the major sectors of the economy. Expectations, especially those of business men, are grounded in such material things as current and future prospects for sales and profits. Psychological behavior cannot create a depression, although if it becomes evident that Washington is not prepared to do more than talk about “anti-recession plans,” existing deflationary forces will undoubtedly be strengthened.
The rather disconcerting economic outlook is producing a sharp conflict within Republican ranks. The business men seem to be primarily concerned with looting the public treasury and presumably are not averse to a mild recession and a few millions of unemployment. The politicians, on other hand, have to worry about getting re-elected and maintaining their rather tenuous hold on Congress. The latter group must press for increasing state intervention, even if that runs counter to announced Republican policy.
Just as Republican policy toward the farmers had to be radically reversed, with all major campaign pledges to eliminate price supports, etc., repudiated, we may well find that the politicians will prevail and the state will do its best to prevent unemployment from developing on the eve of an election. Eisenhower’s balanced budget could well go the way of its eminent predecessor, the Roosevelt balanced budget. Under such conditions, and with a major assist from the new rulers of the Kremlin, the basic economic and political motivations for the existence of the Permanent War Economy continue to operate. So long as the fear of Stalinism and war continue to dominate the political scene, the fear of depression cannot dominate the economic outlook, although it is a factor that politicians will ignore at their peril.

Shares of Upper Income Groups in Income and Savings
By Simon Kuznets, assisted by Elizabeth Jenks
National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc. 1953, 725 pp., $9.00.
The political economy the United States of America is indeed strange, as has frequently been remarked by analysts with varying points of view in the political spectrum. Moreover, in no other country is public relations and the art of sweeping exaggeration been carried to such refined lengths. This social environment helps to explain why a crude statistical work achieves front page publicity in the New York Times.
When the preliminary findings of the Kuznets study were released early in 1952, the New York Times gave them substantial coverage in its issue of March 5, 1952, starting with a front-page headline: Shift in Income Distribution Is Reducing Poverty in U.S. The lead paragraph by economic reporter Will Lissner stated: The United States has undergone a social revolution in the last four decades, and particularly since the late Thirties.” To be sure, the same newspaper, in an article by the same reporter one month later – to be precise on April 3, 1952 – carried an article with the headline: Living Standards Off 4 per cent Since Korea. This is the conclusion of a study by Dr. Julius Hirsh on the impact of price rises and tax increases on the moderate income city worker’s four person family – “the type of family ... that occurs most frequently in the varied structure of the American urban family.”
The “social” revolution apparently was not too profound, or at any rate it proved to be rather short-lived. Perhaps history was rather unkind to the advocates of the American “social” revolution by launching the Korean war before the findings of the Kuznets study were made public, and before the advertising agencies could use these findings to launch a campaign for reduction of taxes on the upper income groups.
What are the Kuznets’ findings? Lissner summarizes them with reasonable accuracy in the above-mentioned article, as follows:
As a result of little-appreciated changes in the distribution of a rapidly growing national income, the United States has gone about half the way toward eliminating inequities in incomes. But it has done this, not by leveling down, but by leveling up. These are some of the changes:
The very poor have become fewer by two-thirds of their 1939 number.
The poor have become better off. Where three out of four families had incomes of less than $2,000 a year in 1939, only one out of three fell into that class ten years later.
The well-to-do and the rich have become more numerous. In the late Thirties one family in about fifty was in the $5,000 and over income class, and one out of 100 was in the $10,000 and over class. In the late Forties, one family out of six was in the $5,000 and over class, and one out of twenty in the $10,000 and over class.
Over the years, the very rich have become poorer because the rise in labor incomes has been accompanied by a decline in property incomes. The share of the upper 1 per cent of income receivers in total income has declined in thirty-five years from 16 per cent to 9 per cent.
The Kuznets study, of course, is concerned primarily with what has happened to the upper income groups – the top one, five or seven per cent of the population. In his article in the May 1, 1953 issue of the New York Times, based on release of the entire study, Lissner provides a more up-to-date summary of the major findings of Kuznets’ statistical analysis and identifies the source of interpretation of these income changes as a “social” revolution.
The decline in upper group shares of total individual income was sharpest for the top 1 per cent of income receivers in the total population. This group had per capita incomes of $5,500 and up in 1948 and thereafter, and typical family incomes of $22,000 and up. Its share, before Federal income taxes, dropped from 12 per cent in 1939–40 to 8½ per cent in 1947–48. After taxes, the drop was from 11 to 6 per cent ...
From 1913 to 1948 the per capita income of the top 1 per cent little more than doubled. The Consumers Price Index rose two-and-a-half times its 1913 level; the upper group failed even to maintain its real income. The per capita income of the mass of the population, the lower 99 per cent group, rose to four times its 1913 level, making a vast improvement in its real income.
This was much more than a mere consequence of the shifts in income distribution which have been reducing poverty in the United States, reported in detail in The New York Times of March 5. These shifts, called “a social revolution” by Dr. Arthur F. Burns, Economic director to the President and research director, on leave, of the National Bureau would have produced only a moderate proportional decline.
Inasmuch as there have been more profound statistical studies than this, including several by Kuznets – none which has received notice outside the professional journals – one forced to the conclusion that it is label “social revolution” that is largely or exclusively responsible for widespread dissemination of the findings of the present study. And it is not without interest that Burns, also carries the title of Professor of Economics at Columbia University, is now chief economic adviser to the President.
Whether Burns is aware of the meaning of the phrase, “social revolution,” we do not know. Certainly Kuznets is not in any way responsible for this remarkable label. He merely presents his findings in a technical manner, hardly intended for the lay reader, surrounds them with the usual caveats and tables of derivatives and substantiation almost without end. The suspicion must remain however, that Burns was well aware of the fact that referring to changes in income distribution as a “social revolution” would result in extraordinary publicity and presumably in support for redistributing the tax burden – a goal that Burns apparently favors. Consider, for example the following paragraph from the first Lissner story:
He, Arthur F. Burns, who directed an important part of these investigations, concludes that we have about reached the limit of the usefulness of the income tax as a device for redistributing income. To raise the large revenues required for security at home and abroad, the tax must be heavily on the brackets where income in concentrated – moderate-sized incomes.
The “social” revolution thus fades into something far short of the expropriation, or even the impoverishment of the bourgeoisie. It would seem to center around the high individual income tax rates and the reduction in the proportion of national income going to dividends and interest – developments flowing from the development of the Permanent War Economy. The most important development of the Permanent War Economy, in so far as Kuznets’ findings are concerned, is clearly the sharp reduction in unemployment.
States Kuznets (p. xxxvii of his Introduction and Summary):
This recent decline in upper group shares, which for its magnitude and persistence is unmatched in the record, obviously has various causes. The most prominent are the reduction of unemployment and the marked increase in total income flowing to lower income groups (particularly farmers and wage earners); shifts in the saving and investment habits of upper income groups which may have curtailed their chances of getting large receipts from successful mature capital and equity investments; lower interest rates; and steeper income taxes. But conjectures alone are possible, and the discussion in the report is limited to a statement of facts.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
It is more than a coincidence that the basic economic program of the Eisenhower Administration is to reverse this so-called “social” revolution by reducing taxes on the upper income groups, raising the rate of interest, stimulating venture capital and thereby encouraging higher dividends, and stimulating a slight case of unemployment so that labor will not be so demanding and wages can be reduced.
Only the exigencies of the class struggle can account for the absolutely unpardonable use of the term “social revolution” in connection with the relatively insignificant changes that have taken place in income distribution since the development of the Welfare State and, more recently, the Permanent War Economy. Nevertheless, it is still of considerable interest to examine the changes that have taken place in the distribution of income.
Of more interest than the findings of Kuznets are the reports of the Census Bureau. These are based on Census surveys and may be considered to be much more reliable than data based on income tax returns, as is true of Kuznets. The Census data are before taxes and limited to wage or salary recipients. Dividing the latter into five groups, we get the following picture in percentages for selected years from 1939 to 1951:

In other words, so far as wages and salaries are concerned, accounting for about 70 per cent of total income payments to individuals, the middle income groups have gained – not only at the expense of the upper income group, but also at the expense of the lower income group. At any rate, regardless of what interpretation one cares to make of the above figures, there is clearly nothing that can justify the use of the term “social” revolution.
Kuznets, of course, is concerned primarily with the upper income groups. His figures show a higher decline for the top 1 per cent than for the top 5 per cent – and it is clear that no definition of the upper income groups can properly extend as far as the top 20 per cent. But the major decline has taken place since 1940–41, and this is precisely the period in which individual income tax rates have been raised enormously. The question of the reliability of the estimates is an inevitable one, and Kuznets is greatly bothered by it, spending an entire chapter of 75 pages, including appendix tables, in justifying his methodology. The chapter starts, however, by stating (p. 435):
We cannot measure the probable errors in our estimates directly because our basic data are either by-products of tax administration or products of censuses, subject to all the imperfections of social records. Some defects are obvious and the adjustments discussed in preceding chapters were designed to correct for them as far as possible. But after all these adjustments, errors inevitably remain, and we are faced with the difficult task of appraising them. This discussion of the reliability of our estimates must necessarily be incomplete and inconclusive. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
If it is inconclusive as to whether the estimates are reliable, it may be wondered why the study was made. Kuznets indicates that the choice between using income tax returns and abandoning the study, and he obviously feels that the basic trends revealed by his study are correct. If by this were meant the small relative improvement in the position of the middle income groups, as shown by Census data, empirical evidence would clearly confirm such findings. For the average number of income earners has increased sharply among factory and white collar workers’ families as unemployment has decreased and the percentage of women employees has risen to an all-time high. In other words, on a family basis there can be little doubt that there has been increase in the average standard of living since 1939. This is also true on a per capita basis, but it is not so pronounced.
When, however, the claim is made that the upper income groups one per cent or five per cent) have experienced both an absolute and relative decline in their income shares, therefore presumably in their standards of living, one should look with a rather skeptical and jaundiced eye on an analysis that depends completely on the reliability of income tax data. After many comparisons and reliability tests, Kuznets refers to a sample audit study of 1948 income tax returns (which show a minimum of 70 out of 100 returns in the $25,000 and over bracket as containing errors) and concludes (p. 466):
The audit study, as far as the recent results go, warrants an inference that such underestimation is within a 5 cent margin for incomes at the to 5 per cent level, and within a 10 per, margin for incomes in the 2nd through to 5th percentage bands. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The difficulty is that the results do not go very far. They cannot do justice the extensive legal tax avoidance practiced by the upper income groups as analyzed in some detail in Part VI of The Permanent War Economy: Taxation and the Class Struggle, cf. November–December 1951 issue of The New International).
Our own private sample study of millionaires (the only reliable method of estimating what has happened to the incomes of the bourgeoisie) indicates that they are managing to survive although the fees to tax accountants and lawyers have increased rather sharply. Mansions costing in excess of $100,000 are still being built – in fact, in larger numbers than in any period during the last 25 years. Of course, vacations are frequently transformed into business trips – or is it vice-versa? Profits are frequently allowed to remain in corporations, in the expectation that the Eisenhower administration will ultimately reduce the surtax rates in the upper income brackets, so that it will “pay” to retrieve the dividends that are waiting to be declared. Some of these factors Kuznets tries to take into account, but the majority (and they are cumulatively decisive) are beyond statistical analysis.
We can only conclude that in a period of high tax rates any analysis of upper income groups based on tax returns is not only necessarily inconclusive, but tends to be unreliable. Kuznets, moreover, bases his analysis on a per capita approach. Aside from certain statistical difficulties in converting income tax returns to a per capita basis, the procedure as a measure of what has happened to upper income groups is exceedingly questionable. While the size of families in upper income brackets is smaller than in lower income groups, an upper income group with a large family might well be excluded from Kuznets’ array of the data on a per capita basis. If the purpose of the study is to discover something about standards of living, and not just to collect a lot of figures, then the facts of economic life have to be considered. Using the Kuznets approach, a single individual with an income of $25,000 annually would be part of the upper one per cent in 1948, but a family of five with the one income earner admitting to an income of $100,000 for the year might be excluded since the per capita is only $20,000. Such an analysis overlooks the fact that one mansion is usually sufficient for a family of this type; in any case, five mansions are rarely used. An analysis of shares of upper income groups necessarily involves a ratio of two quantities. The numerator, of course, consists of the amount of income going to the upper income groups, however income is defined. And it makes quite a difference as to what is or is not included in income. The Kuznets data necessarily contain a downward bias (probably on the order of twenty to thirty per cent) in the amount of income currently (since 1943) going to the upper income groups. The numerator of the income ratio is thus understated. But the ratio also depends on the size of the denominator. Here Kuznets uses what amounts to his own estimates of national income. This tends to overstate because of its inclusion of income in kind, imputed rent and other such concepts that are clearly not part of any analysis of the performance of a capitalist economy. If the numerator is noticeably smaller than it should be, and denominator somewhat larger than is proper for analysis, the resulting ratio is necessarily considerably smaller than it ought to be.
Unfortunately, we do not have available the statistical resources of the National Bureau of Economic Research or the Department of Commerce, but the decline in the shares of upper income groups since 1939 is not nearly as large as reported. Such decline as has occurred, moreover, is principally confined to the period upper income groups since 1929 is not Permanent War Economy. [This is in the original. – Note by transcriber] The bourgeoisie have not been destroyed or impoverished. They have succeeded, so far, in preserving their basic wealth, income and property. Nor has there been any diminution in the political power of the American bourgeoisie. What has happened, as we pointed out in the November#8211;December 1951 issue of The New International (p. 338), is that: “The state however, whose function is more and more to protect the rule and the wealth of the bourgeoisie, is being financed in steadily increasing measure by the workers and lower middle classes. Therein lies the secret role of taxation under the Permanent War Economy, while equality of incomes remains just as much a mirage on the horizon as it ever was.” (Italics in the original.)
Kuznets has contributed data that may be useful to income analysts. He is the real pioneer in national income data, and as one who justifiably claims to be a scientist in his field, he should blush at the “social” revolution that Burns has produced from his highly qualified data. Above all Kuznets ought to investigate why his data are being used as part of the drive, spearheaded by the NAM to reduce the tax burden of the upper income groups.

The Stalinist “peace offensive” has been a long time in coming, but it was inevitable so long as the military stalemate continued in Korea. Stalin’s death may have accelerated the new Kremlin line, although there is considerable evidence that the basic strategy and major tactics of the “peace offensive” were worked out under Stalin’s personal leadership during the past six months. Stalin’s heirs may require time to work out and consolidate the succession. They may also wish to take precautions against any bold foray by the advocates of “preventive war” in Washington; and in an atmosphere of “peace” counsels of military attack are not likely to make much of an impression. Above all, however, they must figure on the “peace offensive” strengthening already apparent deflationary tendencies in the American economy.
Initial reactions in the United States show that the Kremlin’s strategists have not entirely miscalculated. A front-page article on April 8 by ace political reporter of the New York Times, James Reston, is headlined, Soviet Tactics Give U.S. Problem of Avoiding Slump if Peace Comes. The dependence of American prosperity on war outlays is expressed by Reston in these words:
“So long as the Kremlin was waging war in Asia and crying havoc all over the world, the Western nations were able to achieve full employment at home and at least a measure of unity with each other.”
After pointing out that a host of problems in the field of foreign policy are pressing for solution, Reston goes on to state:
The drop in stock market prices immediately after the red doves were sent aloft in Moscow was another reminder to the Administration that the pace of its planning in the domestic economic field was also running behind the pace of world events.
Labor union leaders, concerned about the talk here of cutting the defense budget, already have started appealing to the President to plan at once for the day when the vast Government orders for munitions will drop off. This same thesis is being heard within the President’s official family, particularly from those officials who have been studying the meaning of the recent Soviet moves.
These officials see increasing evidence of an internal struggle for power in Moscow. They believe that, for the time being, the Soviet leaders may want to relax the tension in the world so that they can deal with these internal problems. But the observers think that at the same time the Soviet hierarchy is trying to bring the United States up against the major problem of keeping its people employed when it shifts to a modified peace economy.
In the Soviet mind, the capitalist world cannot close the gap between its production and consumption without vast expenditures for war. The Russians insist on believing that Americans have learned nothing about distribution in the last fifty years and that the only answer to unemployment here is to create international crises that put men to work in the munitions factories.
Even more forthright is Arthur Krock, in his column in the New York Times of April 5:
Though tragic is the jest that what officials fear more than dateless war in Korea is peace, the jest has a real foundation. The vision of peace which could lure the free world into letting down its guard, and demolishing the slow and costly process of building collective security in western Europe while the Soviets maintained and increased their military power, is enough to make men in office indecisive. And the stock market selling that followed the sudden conciliatory overtures from the Kremlin supports the thesis that immediate prosperity in this country is linked to a war economy and suggests desperate economic problems that may arise on the home front. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The possibility, even the probability, of a major change in the political and economic climate serves as an opportunity to review some of the major trends in the Permanent War Economy and to focus attention on some neglected aspects that are not without importance. First, however, it is instructive to recall the so-called “Varga controversy” that disturbed Stalinist circles in 1947. It will be recalled that virtually all Stalinist theoreticians took the position that there would be an immediate capitalist collapse following the cessation of military hostilities. Varga, however, disagreed. He maintained that there would be a short period of capitalist prosperity before any crisis developed. The dispute was important not only for its substantive features, but because it is alleged that Varga’s political mentor was Malenkov.
According to the authors of one of the reports of a Zhdanov-Malenkov faction fight, Zhdanov was the “internationalist,” basing his “revolutionary offensive” on the prospect of postwar depression in the capitalist world. Malenkov, however, is supposed to have been the “nationalist,” advocating concentration on Stalinland’s internal problems. Varga’s views were supposed to have been anathema to Zhdanov and to have been welcomed by Malenkov. When Varga was disgraced, it was presumably evidence that Zhdanov had the upper hand in his struggle with Malenkov. Why, then, Varga waited until 1949, after Zhdanov’s death in 1948, to recant is not at all clear. Be that as it may, if Varga played such an important role in the struggle for Stalin’s mantle, he has presumably been installed as number one economic advisor to the Kremlin now that Malenkov is premier. Thus reasons the “cloak-and-dagger” school of interpreting Kremlin actions, of which there are many and varied exponents in this country.
Regardless of whether Varga’s views were or are of political importance in helping to determine Kremlin policy, he has been the leading Stalinist economist and a summary of his views may well be instructive in providing some insight into the motivation for the Kremlin’s “peace offensive.” An article by Evsey D. Domar, associate professor of political economy at The Johns Hopkins University, in the March 1950 issue of the American Economic Review, entitled The Varga Controversy, summarizes the essence of Varga’s predictions (published in September 1946), as:

During the first decade after the war economic conditions will be a natural aftermath of the war itself.
 
The impoverished countries of Europe and Asia will suffer throughout the period from what he calls a “crisis of underproduction.”
 
The United States, Canada and other countries whose productive capacities were greatly increased during the war will enjoy a short, two-to-three-year prosperity after its end.
 
This short prosperity will be followed by a sharp crisis of overproduction, probably more prolonged than that of 1920–21.
 
When this crisis has been overcome, a new industrial cycle will begin. It will be not of the 1921–29, but of the 1929–37, type; i.e., its recovery will be incomplete. In its background there will be a sharp and prolonged agrarian crisis. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)

The above analysis conforms rather well to actual events, if one assumes that the outbreak of the Korean war prevented the “recession” of 1949–50 from developing into “a sharp crisis of overproduction.” Actually, of course, neither Varga nor any other Stalinist foresaw the development of the Permanent War Economy, but Varga’s expectations of “a sharp and prolonged agrarian crisis” are prescient. For the agricultural crisis has already started, as the Republicans are beginning to discover.
While the news of surplus butter, and threatened surpluses in wheat, cotton, tobacco, etc., is more dramatic, any Kremlin analyst working on trends in the American economy would be able to point up a number of significant developments indicating that a downswing in the economic cycle is at hand:

The raising of the rate of interest. The Federal Reserve rediscount rate has been raised from one and three-quarter per cent to two per cent. This has the effect of reducing business loans by commercial banks and raising the bank rate. The Eisenhower Administration has also raised the interest rate on long-term (thirty-year) bonds to 314 per cent, the impact of which will reinforce the tendencies already at work to raise the average rate of interest throughout the economy. A rise in the average late of interest is normally deflationary; in fact, it is because of a mistaken fear of further inflation that the Eisenhower Administration has admittedly used state power to bring about a rise in the rate of interest.
 
The falling backlog of orders in the machine tool industry. This was already evident at the end of last year, for the Wall Street Journal in its edition of December 29, 1952 was able to write:

“The heyday of new defense business for machine tool builders is about running out, at least for the time being. This is in marked contrast to the deluge of orders that poured in a year ago on an industry struggling feverishly to expand production ... Backlogs, meantime, continue to be further reduced as rated productive capacity goes up and new business falls off. The industry now has enough business on its books to keep it working at capacity for 11 months, compared with about 18 months at the start of 1952. However, the backlogs are not evenly distributed. Only about one-fourth of the industry can boast a six-month-or-more backlog. Included in the remainder, in fact, are many companies looking for business.”

And the machine tool industry, of course, is the prime mover in the production of means of production.


The slight, but steady, decline in wholesale prices. The wholesale price index for all commodities of the Department of Labor (which has a base of 1947–1949 equal to 100) declined during 1952 from 113 in January to 109.6 in December. While this is a decline of only 3 per cent, it indicates that the period of acute inflation in the primary markets is passed. As a matter of fact, for several months now virtually every raw material has been in distinctly easy supply. The final evidence, of course, is the abandonment of the Controlled Materials Plan, revealing that there is an ample supply of basic metals. While the Eisenhower Administration boasts of decontrol as part of its philosophy, the truth of the matter is that the basic decontrol steps so far taken were planned under the Truman Administration.
 
The parity ratio, comparing prices received and paid by farmers, shows a perceptible decline during 1952. The figure was 105 in January 1952, but declined almost 10 per cent to 95 in January 1953. Since the parity ratio is based on average prices received and paid by farmers in the period 1910–1914, which was a rather good period for American farmers, a parity ratio below 100 does not indicate that farmers are starving. But a decline of 10 per cent in a year is precipitous, and when the parity ratio goes below 100 (which it did beginning November) political storms start brewing in the Congressional farm bloc.
 
The deflationary attitude of the Eisenhower Administration as contrasted with the inflationary outlook of the preceding Truman Administration. This manifests itself in various ways, notably in announced programs to reduce Federal expenditures, to stretch out the defense program over a longer period of years, while at the same time there is an apparent refusal to reduce taxes and strict admonishment about the dangers in the expansion of consumer credit. The Eisenhower Administration is believed to be not averse to a mild deflation and to an accompanying modest rise in unemployment.

It is only natural, therefore, that the Kremlin should be aware of growing signs of a deflationary trend in the American economy and should seek to take advantage of them. If its “peace offensive” encourages a larger reduction in war outlays than already planned, the possibilities of American internal difficulties diverting attention from consolidation of alliances and strengthening the military position of American imperialism abroad are that much greater. Moreover, no careful analysis of the American economy is required to arrive at the conclusion that deflation is at hand. It is only necessary to read the public statements of responsible spokesmen of big business and organized labor.
For example, Fortune magazine in its March 1953 issue states:
A majority of U.S. businessmen expect some sort of decline in business activity in the next couple of years, according to a recent Journal of Commerce survey, as do a majority of economists and analysts of business. Fortune looks for a slight downturn as early as the second half of the year. But as for the larger and longer-term worries about recession or depression sometime in 1954 or 1955, we believe the readjustment is apt to be mild, if relatively prolonged.
After a discussion of semantics and defining a “readjustment” as a mild recession, Fortune takes an unusually forthright position (which accounts for this article being much quoted) by stating:
The present outlook is for “a mild but prolonged readjustment,” perhaps lasting a year and a half, because non-durable goods and services should grow as taxes come down (along with defense outlays), and because public works and exports should offset a decline in capital expenditures. This readjustment would wind up, according to Fortune’s “reasonable” projection of 1955, with G.N.P. and industrial output distinctly below prospective capacity and with possibly five million unemployed. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Unemployment of five million would mean an increase of 200 per cent over present levels, and would undoubtedly pose serious problems. Such a prospect naturally concerns organized labor, particularly its more articulate sections such as the U.A.W. One can, for example, quote at great length from the report of President Walter P. Reuther to the 14th Constitutional Convention of the UAW, held at the end of March at Atlantic City. A 20-page section on General Economic Conditions begins by stating:
“The national economy is now headed for a long-postponed showdown with basic economic realities. Since 1939, when 9½ million unemployed walked the streets, there has been no real test of the stability of our economy. In all the years since, this country has not had to face up to the question of whether we can raise our living standards to match our power to produce, and then keep both rising together.”
After recounting the increase in productive capacity (“Manufacturing capacity increased by 31 per cent from 1939 to 1946 and by 55 per cent from 1946 to 1952”) and the enormous currently unsatisfied needs of the American working class, as well as reviewing in a comprehensive manner the basic trends within the economy, Reuther concludes with an impressive non-sequitur that “our economy [must] move rapidly forward to constantly improved living standards, or collapse in depression.”
One should not fall victim to one’s own propaganda. Everyone will agree that the constant improvement of living standards is a desirable goal, but the probability of such a development is rather small. In fact, under the Permanent War Economy it is impossible over any extended period of time. It does not, therefore, follow – as Reuther (and others) would have us believe – that the economy will “collapse in depression.” On the contrary, an understanding of the Permanent War Economy would reveal that a sizable depression is excluded. This does not mean that a downturn is impossible. We have shown in our original series of articles on the Permanent War Economy that “the changes [in the ratio of war outlays to total output] are rapid and qualitative in nature, which is another characteristic of the Permanent War Economy stage of capitalism. The figures suggest that about 10 per cent of total output must be spent in the form of war outlays before the latter become significant in their impact.” (The New International, January–February, 1951, p. 38)
 
ACTUALLY, WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT the ratio of war outlays to total output is beginning to decline. This trend was already evident prior to the start of the new Stalinist “peace offensive.” It appears likely that it will become more pronounced in the near future. There is still no evidence, however, that capitalism intends to abandon the Permanent War Economy. Both political and economic considerations clearly exclude such a variant.
If we revert to the analogy of “habit-forming drugs,” used in the introduction to Part III of the series on the Permanent War Economy, Increasing State Intervention (cf.
The New International, May–June 1951, p. 132), we can refer to the economy as a drug addict. War outlays are the drug which has sustained a high level of economic activity. As is apparently the case with pathological drug addicts, a constantly increasing dosage is required in order to maintain the same effects of activity as previously. The measurement of the “dosage” is the ratio of war outlays to total output. Even a stable ratio of war outlays leads to a process of atrophy setting in. The “appetite” of the economy for war outlays increases steadily. If the ratio of war outlays to total output, although significant, merely remains level, tendencies toward a slackening in activity begin to appear in various sectors. If, on top of this, an actual decline in the ratio of war outlays to total output is to be recorded, then deflationary consequences are unavoidable. How much deflation is, of course, another question. There can be deflation without depression, in any recognizable meaning of the term.

* Net national product is derived from gross national product for 1952, as shown in the March 1953 issue of the Survey of Current Business; war outlays are derived from the Commerce series on National Security, together with the Treasury series on National Defense and Related Activities. Our estimates, therefore, follow the procedure explained in the text and are dependent upon official government figures.



Inasmuch as it is now more than two years since the basic calculations were made in the development of the theory of the Permanent War Economy, we can now substitute actuals for our estimates. This is done below for the period 1949–1952 inclusive.
Our concept of measuring the ratio of war outlays by comparing direct and indirect war outlays to net national product remains as heretofore stated. Our concepts of direct and indirect war outlays, however, have undergone some modification because in the interim Commerce has redefined and republished the Federal war component of Federal government purchases of goods and services. This has been in the form of a series entitled “national security,” which is broken down into “national defense” and “other national security.” The definitions, contained in the July 1952 issue of the Survey of Current Business, are:
“National defense purchases comprise the purchases of the Atomic Energy Commission, Defense Department, Maritime Administration (before 1950), National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and Selective Service System, together with purchases for the programs of defense production and economic stabilization, foreign military assistance administered by Mutual Security Agency (formerly Mutual Defense Assistance program), and the stockpiling of strategic and critical materials.”
This is a broader concept than we previously used, and involves shifting from indirect to direct war outlays such programs as atomic energy, foreign military assistance and military stockpiling. There can, however, be no objection to this revised definition of war outlays.
The “other national security” series of Commerce forms only one part of our concept of indirect war outlays, for it is defined as comprising those purchases of “the Maritime Administration (after 1949), National Security Council, National Security Resources Board, Philippine Damage Commission, and State Department, as well as purchases for the following foreign economic assistance programs: those now administered by the Mutual Security Agency, government and relief in occupied areas, India Emergency Food Aid, International Children’s Emergency Fund, and Yugoslav Emergency Relief Assistance." To this base, we have added purchases of the Veterans’ Administration, as well as certain minor governmental programs, as explained in Part I, p. 36 of the January–February 1951 issue of The New International.
The differences between our revised calculations and our earlier estimates may be seen by comparing the ratios of war outlays to total output, as follows:

Not only did we fail to take into account the degree of inflation that actually occurred (in fact, we deliberately made no attempt to forecast the amount of inflation), but we also underestimated the real increase in production and overestimated the amount actually spent on war outlays, as there developed a considerable lag between military expenditure plans and actual purchases. There was, in addition, of course, the conscious stretching out of the defense program by the Truman Administration. The trend line of our new series differs markedly from the old. War outlays have not reached the 20 per cent level, and the necessity for direct controls on production and prices has diminished. Moreover, the rate of increase in the ratio of war outlays to total production has been significantly less than predicted, thereby encouraging the process of atrophy to develop.
The pronounced change that has occurred in the economic outlook may be seen quite clearly from examining the 1952 data on a quarterly basis, while remembering that in our original forecasts we had expected the peak ratio of war outlays to be reached in 1953, as was at that time the apparent plan. On the assumption that net national product will show the same trend as gross national product, and the further assumption that our total war outlay series will correlate closely in trend with the Commerce series for total national security, we can construct index numbers for the quarterly ratios in 1952, with the first quarter of 1952 as base. We then obtain the following picture:



Index Numbers of War Outlays Ratio




First Quarter 1952


100




Second Quarter 1952


107




Third Quarter 1952


106




Fourth Quarter 1952


102



As can be seen from the above tabulation, the incidence of war outlays during the current military build-up reached a peak during the second quarter of 1952. A slight decline during the third quarter of 1952 was followed by a more significant decline in the last quarter of the year. Present information indicates that this trend continued during the first quarter of 1953. Here, then, we have cogent economic reasons for the setting in of a deflationary trend. The fact that the ratio of war outlays to total output can change in both level and direction during the epoch of the Permanent War Economy is a factor of enormous importance in appraising current trends in the economy, and one of the more neglected aspects of the theory of the Permanent War Economy.
On reexamination, therefore, we feel that our basic conclusions remain valid, although certain formulations may require modification and several of our short-term predictions are invalidated by faulty assumptions. We have, for example, referred to the chronic character of inflation under the Permanent War Economy. Over a period of years, this remains true; yet, as we did indicate, there will be ups and downs in the price level. Hence, a formulation such as “This rate of increase in the price level will continue to be maintained, regardless of controls, because inflation is unceasing and permanent” (Part II, Declining Standards of Living, March–April 1951 issue of The New International, p. 89) is incorrect. It has to be modified by the demonstrable fact that there is a marked variation in the ratio of war outlays to total output, and during the period when the ratio declines, the inflationary pressures are reduced and, in many cases, converted into their opposites – i.e., deflationary pressures.
The decline in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumers’ Price Index, new or old, of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is clear-cut evidence that the peak of the present inflation has passed. The manner in which several large corporations have used this decline in the cost of living to reduce wages should serve as a reminder that the class struggle has not disappeared.
In retrospect, it is clear that our major error of fact was our gross underestimation in the amount of capital accumulation that could be expected to take place in the period following the outbreak of the Korean war. While we consciously underestimated in order to maximize the amount of civilian output available to sustain civilian standards of living, we neglected to take into sufficient account the fact that even at a 20 per cent level of war outlays there was room for sizable private capital accumulations that did not exist in 1943–1944, when the ratio of war outlays exceeded 40 per cent. As a consequence, we have underestimated the impact of capital accumulation in sustaining the inflationary boom. By the same token, we have not given full weight to the increase in productive capacity to which these unusually large capital accumulations have given rise.
It may help, therefore, if we set the record straight by presenting revised

actual figures on capital accumulation in substitution for our previous estimates. As before, we equate capital accumulation to net investment in the Commerce private capital formation series. This procedure possesses several weaknesses, especially a dubious treatment of inventory accumulation, but it is the only handy official series and serves the purpose of providing a broad picture of what has happened in this vital sector of the economy.
For the seven post-World War II years, 1946–1952, net private investment totals more than $174 billion, averaging about $25 billion annually. This means that on the average 10 per cent of the net output of each year has been added to the capital stock. There has, consequently, been an enormous increase in productive capacity. This substantial increase in capacity manifests itself first and foremost in durable goods, especially consumer durables. Passenger automobiles, for example, could be produced at a rate of seven million a year and production for 1953 is expected to exceed six million. Since this comes on top of six high production years in a row, there may possibly be some difficulty in disposing of the entire output. The Reuther report, previously cited, states (p. 64): “The industry as a whole, however, is becoming uneasy about future marketing prospects.” In fact, it is a rather open secret in the trade that what prompted the recent price reduction in the Chrysler line is that their cars are backed up all the way to the factory. In short, it may not be long before sales for the entire passenger auto industry fall short of production. Automobile production remains the bellwether of the civilian economy. A similar trend may be expected in several important durable goods lines, thereby adding to the deflationary forces enumerated above.
In discussing the increasingly high organic composition of capital in Part III, Increasing State Intervention, in the May–June 1951 issue of The New International, we stated (p. 150):
“Precisely where the breaking point is likely to be, no one can say, but it is clear that the composition of capital is already dangerously high and constitutes a sword of Damocles, hanging over the unsuspecting head of such a highly-geared capitalist economy that in a few years it is possible to produce all the automobiles, television sets, etc., that can be sold under capitalist conditions of production.”
While precise figures are not available, all available evidence indicates that the composition of capital has continued to increase. Theoretically, these trends ought to result in a falling average rate of profit. Empirical evidence indicates that both the mass and rate of profit did begin to decline in 1952.
If the net investment figures developed in the previous table are compared with net national product (total output) for the same years, 1946–1952, it will be seen that the ratio is 10 or 11 per cent in all but two years. These were 1949, when an “adjustment” took place, and 1952, when a plateau was reached and the beginnings of an adjustment are apparent. In 1949, the ratio of net investment to net national product was 6 per cent. In 1952, it was 8 per cent.
The pressures previously cited that would lead to increasing reliance on state foreign aid, given the continued low level of private exports of capital, remain. To what extent the Eisenhower Administration will curtail state foreign aid remains to be seen. In any case, exports of capital, both state and private, are unlikely to increase and cannot offset the deflationary trends analyzed above.
Some deflation is clearly in process of taking place. The question remains: how much? A sober consensus is given by Thomas F. Conroy in the New York Times of April 12, 1953:
“While the economy appears to be entering a deflationary transition period which may involve some setback and certainly intense competition, business and industry do not face another 1929. There are too many favorable differences between 1953 and 1929.”
In Part V of the Permanent War Economy, Some Significant Trends, September–October 1951 issue of The New International, we stated (p. 254):
“A sharp reduction in war outlays in the near future is therefore unlikely and would in a remarkably short time cause a collapse of the economy.”
There seems no reason warranting change of this forecast. The ratio of war outlays to total output may decline to 15 per cent or thereabouts, but there is no indication that any sharp reduction in war outlays is in prospect. In fact, peace or no peace in Korea, according to Anthony Leviero in the New York Times of April 8th:
“John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, is planning to go to the North Atlantic Treaty Council meeting in Paris on April 23 with a restatement of this country’s defense policy predicated on ten or twenty years of tension.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
It does seem possible, however, that at a 15 per cent level it is possible to dispense with most direct controls, although it is worth noting that the Eisenhower Administration has been forced to set up a permanent control establishment in the Office of Defense Mobilization. This agency will undoubtedly be responsible for introducing the stand-by controls in the event that they become necessary.
While official forecasts are necessarily optimistic, indicating that there will be no deflation, it is apparent that some deflation, accompanied by rising unemployment, perhaps to the level of the five million forecast by Fortune, is the likely order of events over the next two years. There should, therefore, be a consequent eruption in the class struggle, with increasing strikes throughout the economy. Objective conditions are perceptibly ripening for a leap forward in the political level and class consciousness of the American workers, and it behooves the socialist movement to pay close attention to these awakening forces. Let us not go overboard with predictions of dire depression and mass unemployment. But let us not imbibe capitalist propaganda to the effect that “capitalism has learned how to solve the fundamental problems of the business cycle.” Both extremes are wrong and to be avoided in developing socialist policy for the current economic environment and that of the immediate future.
April 1953



In the economic sphere the French Peoples Front has above all tried to emulate Roosevelt’s New Deal. Given, however, the far weaker financial structure of France, all the contradictions of a declining capitalism are accentuated and little has been done, as compared with the United States, in the way of granting concessions to the working class. Moreover, such concessions as the workers have obtained – the 40-hour week, two weeks vacation with pay, etc. – are obviously the result of the direct class-struggle action of the workers; for, where the workers have not been well organized, the Matignon agreements (which settled the strikes of June, 1936) have been violated with impunity by the bosses.
It was under the Blum government that compulsory arbitration was made the law of the land, that the first devaluation was decreed, that the “pause” in social reforms was proclaimed. Thus, already under a so-called “Socialist” government, the French bourgeoisie – badly frightened during June of last year – had been able to reorganize itself and start a smashing offensive which leaves the workers in many cases worse off than before the Matignon agreement, and which has as its objective the wiping out of all the gains made by the workers and the corruption and eventual dissolution of all their organizations. With the virtual abolition of trade union life due to the omnipotence of the CGT bureaucracy (chiefly Stalinist-controlled now) the workers have found it almost impossible to fight against the employers. But, as the rising cost of living pinches them more and moire, they react. This explains the number of recent strikes in a country where strikes are now illegal.
The accumulated discontent of the workers is, indeed, ready to explode. Even the petty functionaries in the trade unions, as their standard of living declines, are ready for strike action. Naturally,, the official “Communist”, “Socialist” and CGT press speaks of “other methods besides strike action”, “we must respect the law”, “order”, “dignity”, but the anti-working class nature of every arbitration decision leaves the worker with very little confidence in such methods.
In addition, the criminal policy of the leadership in most of the recent strikes is sinking deeply into the consciousness of the workers. One example will suffice: In the recent hotel, restaurant and cafe strike in Paris, where the spirit of the workers was excellent, not only did the trade union bureaucracy refuse to provide the strike any sort of national solidarity in the way of funds, etc., not only did the bureaucrats negotiate a shameful contract at the very height of the strike (providing for “the re-employment of not more than 10 per cent of the strike leaders”!), but. L’Humanité and Le Populaire (official organs of the C.P. and S.P.) also proclaimed it as a victory, thus adding insult to injury. Since the workers weren’t very convinced of it, the CP sent Thorez to speak to them and to assure them that they had won a tremendous victory, and it must be all right because the C.P. is in favor of the settlement!
 
Capitalists Profit
Big industry is showing an increase in profits of about 10 per cent and more over last year, and there is a duel between the Peoples Front press and the reactionary press as to whether Blum or Chautemps should receive the credit for increasing the profits of the capitalists! The explanation of the recovery (which is no more than a temporary stabilization of the crisis, as is readily seen from any sort of careful examination of French economy), however is not hard to find. None other than Vincent Auriol, the “Socialist” Minister of Finance in the Blum cabinet, gives away the entire game when, in. his speech at the Marseilles Congress of the SP (Le Populaire, July 12, 1937), he says: “Yesterday’s war, the preparation of national defense – the broken-down arms, the new arms – absorbs 72 per cent of the budget.” (My italics). What more sinister comment could there be on the nature of capitalist profits! What surer indication can there be of the imminence and catastrophic character of the next depression! The entire economic fabric depends for its very life on war preparations.
The bourgeoisie refused to give decree powers to Blum. That Bonapartist weapon must be entrusted to one of their very own – and so, Blum was succeeded by, Chautemps, some parliamentary juggling took place. Bonnet emerged as the miracle man of the financial world. Another devaluation was put through, again lowering the standard of living of the French masses. Every effort is being made to repatriate French capital and attract foreign capital. Blum’s “pause” is not only extended, but 10 billions of francs are pared off the existing reforms in an effort to balance the budget. In little more than two months, the first Bonapartist Peoples Front government has shown the workers and masses very clearly what is in store for them.
 
Prices Soar
Prices are moving up with such astonishing rapidity that hardly one price sign is reliable. If one goes to buy cigarettes and leaves 2 fr., for that is what is marked on the box (of 10), “Pardon, monsieur, it is 2.25 fr. now.” Prices are rising so rapidly that it is almost impossible to estimate the extent of the rise. But it is clear that the whole burden of the rationalization of economy and the preparation for imperialist war is being placed on the workers. Recently, the price of metro (subway) tickets was raised 25 per cent, bus tickets 33 per cent. It is estimated that these price increases, together with increase in taxes and tariffs, which cover every conceivable commodity and service, will result in a 50 per cent rise in the cost of living for the French worker during the coming year.
This increase in the price of necessities, in the basic cost of living, will find a very cold reception amongst the workers. That is why almost every political tendency, from extreme right to extreme left, is agreed that this fall and early winter will be very critical and is almost certain to witness another strike wave and the fall of the Chautemps cabinet.
(In succeeding articles Comrade Demby, who has just returned from France, will deal with the political forces in the French crisis)
 



The rapidly approaching cantonal elections and the October 2 communiqué of the French cabinet serve once again to focus the eyes of the politically conscious on France. The long-smouldering crisis bids fair to break out into the open with far-reaching consequences for France and the entire world. P.J. Philip, Paris correspondent of the New York Times, describes the recent cabinet meeting as having “altered the whole course along which France has been traveling since the Popular Front Government came into power fifteen months ago.”
Signs of the coming crisis and indications as to its nature have not been lacking. Already, during the last months of the Blum cabinet, it was not difficult to see that the major political parties in the Peoples Front were being subjected to different social pressures, which, together with the exigencies of diplomacy and political maneuvering, were tending to pull the People’s From apart – or, at least, sufficed to show that the honeymoon period was over.
The Radicals, conscious instrument of French finance imperialism, have steadily pulled in the direction of a Bonapartist regime – at first, due chiefly to the requirements of foreign policy (alliance with England, strangling of the Spanish Revolution, rapprochement with Germany), but soon the internal situation (especially financial) forced the Senate (dominated toy the Radicals) to kick over the traces and to replace the Blum cabinet by the Chautemps cabinet. In between, the SP has been trying to make the class-collaborationist policy of the People’s Front palatable to the workers and to maintain harmony within its own ranks.
In any case, if one doubts the depth of the dissension within the Peoples Front, or, perhaps even the existence of a crisis, the smoke that has not ceased to obscure the political skies since the coming to power of Chautemps leaves little doubt as to the existence of the crisis, and, to -a lesser extent, of its nature.
 
Socialists Continue Old Line
The National Congress of the SP at Marseilles (July 10–14) openly revealed the crisis. Coming on top of a postponement which facilitated the CAP (Permanent Administrative Committee) in making the decision to support the Chautemp cabinet, after having cracked down on the youth by dissolving the Seine Federation and its paper, La Jeune Garde, and expelling the youth leaders, after having illegalized Pivert’s “Revolutionary Left”, there was bound to be fireworks and the Blum-Faure bureaucracy had to exert all its bureaucratic pressure to maintain its majority. But little did anyone think that the “Socialist” government bureaucracy would be so hard-pressed to maintain its majority, nor that there would be such violent incidents as the fist-fights and other turbulent scenes that many times threatened actually to stop the proceedings.
The most interesting aspect of the Congress was undoubtedly the existence of the three tendencies – Blum-Faure, Zyromski-Bracke and Pivert. To be sure, there was no opposition to the People’s Front in principle – all such opposition having already been expelled or thoroughly squelched. The differences of opinions, therefore, all took place within the framework of class-collaboration, and are, at most, the differences between reformism and centrism. The actions of the first People’s Front Government, “under Socialist leadership,” were overwhelmingly approved by 4,549 to 26.
The major debate, front page news throughout the country, was over the Blum-Faure motion to continue participation in the Chautemps cabinet. It was carried after a tumultuous session by 3,484 mandates against 1,866. The differences became clear, however, only on the debate over general policy, which included perspectives for the future of the party. Blum-Faure again carried the day for their outright reformist policy, receiving 2,949 mandates. Zyromski-Bracke received 1,545 mandates for their positions, which was to support Chautemps but to prepare immediately for the replacement of Chautemps by another Blum cabinet. In the words of Zyromski: “The Chautemps government is not in the image of the People’s Front, but is a poor substitute (ersatz) for a People’s Front Government.” Pivert indignantly denied that he was a “Trotskyite” and proposed a “fighting government” – i.e., the formation of another Blum government immediately, for which he received 894 mandates. The victory of the right-wing bureaucracy was sealed with the election of the new CAP, on which there are 18 supporters of Blum-Faure, 9 of Zyromski-Bracke and 6 of Pivert.
The Stalinists, having toyed with the slogan of “Thorez to power” (Thorez being the General Secretary of the CP and its outstanding leader at present) on July 14th, were the next to cause the political pulse to rise when, on July 29th, L’Humanité (official organ of the CP) ran a front-page editorial for the immediate consummation of organic unity. “The workers want the united party. It was a mistake to have split in 1920.” All this of course, with one eye cocked on the cantonal elections; for, under the French system of run-off elections and the People’s Front agreements organic unity would mean that the unified party (which the Stalinists would be sure to dominate as they have in Catalonia in the case of the PSUC) would gain at the expense of the Radicals.
 
Radicals Divided
The Radicals, themselves, were meanwhile being torn in two. The so-called left wing, dominated by Daladier-Herriot and using the notorious Chautemps, of Stavisky scandal fame, as their mouthpiece, were confident that they could continue to use the alliance with the CP and SP to their own advantage. Fortified by increasing support from the big bourgeoisie (including Le Temps)
they have so far kept the upper hand as against the so-called right wing, led by Caillaux, Bonnet and Delbos, who want to break with the CP and form a center government with Flandin, Laval and Co., more or less on the model of the old “cartel” governments.
The People’s Front has entered its stage of permanent crisis. The government must more and more function openly for what it is – the conscious instrument by which the bourgeoisie maintains its oppression of the masses. That is the real significance of the communiqué of Oct. 2. What else can it mean when “the government recalls to all citizens the necessity for public order and social discipline,” when it makes an appeal to the workers “to renounce definitely ... all occupation of factories,” when it is “resolved to put an end to the agitations and activities of certain foreigners on the soil of the republic”? All the parties of the People’s Front are afraid of one thing above all – that the workers will become fed up with the continued treachery of the People’s Front and will take matters into their own hands again, as they did in the glorious days of June 1936. That is why all the various proposals, contradictory and self-contradictory as they are, must yield before the imperative necessity for the French bourgeoisie to complete the establishment of l’union sacrèe, the national unity which will permit them to enter the coming war without any internal dissension at home.
The cantonal elections are important only insofar as they will elect the people who will then elect the members of the Senate. Undoubtedly, they will witness a “victory” for the People’s Front, especially for the Stalinists, now the strongest single party in France. Apropos of the Senate, it is necessary to recall that part of the new program of the SP, published after the Marseilles Congress, was for the reform of the Senate. When I asked Maurice Paz, member of the CAP and authoritative spokesman for Blum, “How can you expect the Radicals to carry out your new program, when the first program hasn’t been carried out,’’ he replied: “If the Radicals don’t accept our new program, we must then finish the first program.” Somewhat perplexed by this “logic,” I took my question to Jean Longuet, grandson of Karl Marx and an important cog in the reformist bureaucracy. This worthy stated quite baldly: “We have entered into an alliance with the Radicals. This entails certain responsibilities on our part, which we must be prepared to carry out.” Such is the leadership that the French workers have today!
 
Sharp Struggles Ahead
What a picture France presents today! The crisis is evident. Mass revolutionary leadership does not yet exist. The fascist movement is divided within itself and not yet prepared to take power. The bourgeoisie continually lower the standard of living of the workers by depreciating the franc, and incidentally weaken the position of the government as the elections approach. Hundreds of workers and peasants are being massacred in the French colonies, in Indo-China, in Algeria, in Morocco. Bonapartism rears its ugly head. Bourgeois democracy has outlived its historical usefulness. The counter-revolution is being prepared behind the backs of the People’s Front.
The results of the elections can only intensify the crisis. If the workers enter the path of direct class struggle action in the near future, the bourgeoisie may be forced to rely upon a Blum-Thorez government to strangle the revolutionary initiative of the masses. Otherwise, if war does not intervene, the government may witness a steady drift to the right. In any case, complicated as the French political scene is, we do not hesitate to predict that Chautemps will fall in the not-too-distant future and that the French workers will be face to face with a ferocious reaction, wielded by the Stalinists, militarists or fascists, or any combination of the three. No, the course has not been altered by the French cabinet! It is simply that the French bourgeoisie are preparing for tomorrow. Will the workers be ready?
 




To the Editor:
Your publication continues to be one of the few things I read that consistently makes sense. It is only because I like you that I would venture a little disagreement.
T.N. Vance ends his brilliant series on the was economy with what seems to me too great an emphasis on the proposal – “Nationalize the War Industries.” He says this must now be the chief slogan of socialists, and gives it special place among the other transitional slogans as corresponding to the needs of the workers and the times. But how does it actually fit in with our other demands and our philosophy?
The paid thinkers of the rich like to equate socialism with any build-up in the authority of the state. But we have learned to our sorrow that the equation is false. The most nationalized state in existence is the least social, the least beneficial to man. There exists no economic law to guarantee that as economic power is taken from individual companies or combines of companies and put in the hands of a government, it thereby is any easier for the working class to control and apply to pro-human ends.
Many workers who now find it easier to deal with private employers would consider it is calamity for the government to operate all big industry.
If carried into effect, nationalization, unlike the other transitional demands, might not stimulate worker power as opposed to owner power. The sliding scale, though distorted by the employers, has raised a great issue and exposed the administration’s wage-price fakery. With the “books” once opened, things would never again be quite the same. Worker’s control, worker’s defense, these things build the confidence of the class and instruct and educate workers to take further responsibilities.
But putting all economic power in Washington, even under an administration of labor leaders, still leaves open the possibility of transition from a capitalist to a bureaucrat state. And compensation to former owners may eat up the economic benefits. So it seems to me that we should support nationalization if in time of crisis the American working class desires to take this road as have the English, Germans, etc., but not make it an unqualified fundamental issue at any and all times.




 


Sincerely yours,

While the economy keeps rolling on to new peaks of prosperity, with high levels of production and profits, there are some clouds on the horizon. These may be small, but they can grow. Moreover, they are discernible to more or less orthodox supporters of the present system. Above all, they perturb the defenders of small business.
The Annual Report of the Select Committee on Small Business (of the United States Senate, 84th Congress, 1st Session, Report No. 129) in its report of March 1955 has this to say in its introduction:
A searching appraisal of the position of small business within our economy during 1954 does not provide a basis for viewing the future of small, independent enterprises with complacence. In a sense, 1954 was a “normal” year. No war galvanized the industrial community. No depression swept large numbers of small enterprises out of existence. Indeed, the somewhat slower tempo of business activity which became apparent in 1953 and carried over into the first quarters of 1954, quickened perceptibly during the closing months of 1954. It may be assumed that a well-founded spirit of optimism about the immediate business outlook was responsible for the 11,981 business incorporations in December, the highest monthly total since January of 1947, and for the full-year total of 117,164 incorporations which exceeded those of each year since 1947. On the other hand, 10,300 fewer businesses of all types started in the first 6 months of 1954, compared with the same period of 1953, and Dun & Bradstreet recorded 2,224 more failures involving court proceedings or voluntary action likely to end in loss to creditors in 1954 than in 1953.
Your committee realizes, however, that it is easy for selective indices to mislead those who hold that what seems good for the economy as a whole must of necessity also be good for small business. The fate of small, independent businesses is not chained by natural law to the more narrowly fluctuating fortunes of the larger and hardier units within the industrial complex. Countertrends are not only possible, but clearly discernible.
To a businessman, the proof of the pudding must be in the profits. And it is precisely in the profit position of smaller manufacturing enterprises that your committee detects one of the basic aspects of the current small-business situation which is most disturbing. Whether measured by percentage of stockholders’ equity or by percentage of dollars of sales, the profits of smaller manufacturing corporations, after taxes, have shrunk since 1952, while, with few exceptions, the profits of the largest corporations have increased ...
Profits as a percentage of dollar sales present a similar picture for the first 6 months of 1952, compared with the first half of 1954. On this basis, the smallest group’s money-making ability declined 60.9 per cent, while the biggest corporations showed an increase of 10.5 per cent. In addition, the small manufacturer’s share of total sales has drifted downward from 19 per cent in 1947 to 14 per cent in 1953, a trend which, if unchecked, can easily assume alarming significance.
These and other factors strongly suggest to your committee that there are obscure, complex, and underlying forces at work within our economy that are inimical to the future of small, independent enterprise. To discover and correct these causes of the mounting disadvantages facing the small-business man should be a major concern of all who want to see preserved the vigor of our free-enterprise system....
Your committee has long been deeply disturbed over the multiplying evidences of concentration of economic power in the managements of a relatively few huge corporations. Oligarchic control over groups of vital industries, even though such control may be exercised within the letter of the law, must inevitably exert a contracting influence on freedom of endeavor. In each of its annual reports since 1951, your committee has stressed its belief that the threat of monopoly has not lessened, not remained constant, but has, in fact, assumed more menacing proportions. It would, indeed, not be stating the case with excessive emphasis to say that your committee’s uneasiness of former years has turned to grave apprehension.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The above findings, it should be emphasized, are those of the Senate Small Business Committee. Their concern over the growth of monopoly and the consequent weakening of small business is reinforced by the still more recent study of the Federal Trade Commission. As reported in The New York Times of May 20, 1955: “Business mergers, while still well below the pre-depression levels of the late Nineteen Twenties, are running at three times the 1949 rate.” The FTC “gave two major reasons for the current merger wave: an urge to expand production and an inability of smaller companies to get adequate financing for expansion.” (Italics mine. – T.N.V.)
The tremendous accumulation of capital that has taken place in recent years is beginning to be accompanied by a fall in the rate of profit – attacking first the smaller capitalists. The process is not an unexpected one. In discussing the relationships between accumulation of capital and the rate of profit, Marx states (Capital, Vol. III, p. 283):
A fall in the rate of profit and a hastening of accumulation are in so far only different expressions of the same process as both of them indicate the development of the productive power. Accumulation in its turn hastens the fall of the rate of profit, inasmuch as it implies the concentration of labor on a large scale and thereby a higher composition of capital. On the other hand, a fall in the rate of profit hastens the concentration of capital and its centralization through the expropriation of the smaller capitalists, the expropriation of the last survivors of the direct producers who still have anything to give up. This accelerates on one hand the accumulation, so far as mass is concerned, although the rate of accumulation falls with the rate of profit.
It may be objected that profits increased in 1954, but the increase did not help the rate of profit. This, moreover, is true of leading corporations. In the annual study of the National City Bank, contained in the April 1955 Monthly Letter, the return on net assets declined (for 3,442 leading corporations) from 10.6 per cent in 1953 to 10.3 per cent in 1954 despite a four per cent increase in reported net income after taxes. Imagine what the results would have been if not for the tax swindle law of 1954! States the National City Bank:
In the manufacturing industries, which in number of companies and capital investment comprise over half of the totals for all lines of business included in our tabulation, the 1,778 reporting companies show combined net income up 4 per cent. Tax details given by the larger companies indicate that in 1954, on an overall volume of sales about 5 per cent lower than in 1953, pre-tax earnings were down 10 per cent. Liability for federal income and excess profits taxes declined by 25 per cent, with the portion of pretax earnings absorbed by such taxes in the two years declining from an average of 53 to 45 per cent.” (Italics mine. – T.N.V.)
The dependence of private capitalists on the capitalist state for maintenance of the profits of the bourgeoisie as a class is thus shown in a relatively new and graphic form. Profits, of course, remain the end-purpose of economic activity (“the proof of the pudding”) under capitalism.
One of the main props of the prosperity in the first half of 1955 has been the automobile industry. Never before in history has American capitalism produced automobiles at such fantastic rates. According to Dun’s Review and Modern Industry for May 1955,
More cars were produced in the first quarter than in any other quarter in history. The record total of 781,000 cars reached in March was almost matched in April (a shorter month) as production continued at, the starting rate of about 30,000 cars per day, which means that cars have been rolling off the assembly likes at the rate of one each three seconds, night and day ... During the first half of 1955 more than 4 million cars will probably be made. Before 1949 there had been only one year – 1929 – in which more than 4 million cars were made during an entire year.
Profits of the big three (GM, Ford and Chrysler) have been huge. The smaller automobile companies have been forced to merge in an attempt to remain alive. Meanwhile, what has happened to the dealers? They are not doing so well; in fact, they are not sharing in the profits of the big automobile manufacturers at all. Nor is the outlook likely to improve, as dealers have been forced to take unprecedented quantities of cars from the manufacturers. The same analysis in Dun’s goes on to say:
The supplies of new cars with dealers rose noticeably to 624,277 in the beginning of April, to reach a postwar peak. However, at the present rate of sales which have been outrunning output, new car inventories are entirely reasonable. Notwithstanding the expansion in sales, The National Automobile Dealers Association reports that operating profits for new car and truck dealers are the worst in fifteen years. (Italics mine. – T.N.V.)
 
IT IS NOT ONLY the small manufacturer, but the small business man in general whose position is steadily worsening, while monopoly capital is steadily strengthened. These fundamental trends of a capitalism that has outlived its historical usefulness more than a generation ago are reinforced and accelerated by the development of the Permanent War Economy. War outlays are necessarily concentrated in large aggregations of capital. The Senate Small Business Committee, in the previously cited report, states in the chapter on Military Procurement that
“all business and Government agencies have experienced dislocations due to the conversion from the highly geared war economy of the Korean war period to a reduced defense-production economy. This transition period has been fraught with changes in Government buying policies, which have caused much concern within the ranks of small business and among Government officials charged with the responsibility of procurement functions.”
Later on, it becomes clear that the concern is with “negotiated” contracts, as small business is suspicious of all contracts awarded by negotiation. When to this attitude is added the fact that “Since 1950 approximately 90 per cent of the dollar value of all purchasing has been awarded by negotiation, and the emergency exception has been widely used to justify this sharp departure from the basic method of advertising,” it becomes clear that despite all the double-talk small business has not been doing so well in receiving military contracts.
Perhaps, if large-scale war outlays do not mean increased business for small enterprises at the manufacturing level, small retailers benefit from the existence of the Permanent War Economy. Not very directly, according to the Hoover Commission Report on Business Enterprises, for the digest published by the Research Department of the Citizens Committee for the Hoover Report bemoans the fact that government is allegedly taking business away from private enterprise by various forms of government enterprise. The magnitude of the competition is indicated by the volume of business done by commissary stores and post exchanges. The annual figures cited are as follows:



   199 commissary stores in the US


 


$185,000,000




   239 commissary stores abroad


  121,000,000




   450 post exchanges in the US


  470,000,000




2,700 post exchanges abroad


  540,000,000



Thus, over $1.3 billion of sales are “lost” by retailers. The Hoover Commission observes that
The whole operation [of commissary stores] is at least a vivid illustration of how bureaucracy can expand against the intent of the Congress, accompanied by a failure to include real costs. The real justification of the continued operation of most of these stores is a “fringe benefit” to the military personnel and their families.
The question arises as to whether ... increased salary payments ... would not be more consonant with sustaining our economic system.
What hurts is not only the loss of business, but the fact that millions of servicemen, and through them their families, are able to purchase a variety of commodities at substantial reductions from prevailing retail prices. From the point of view of the military budget, it would obviously be poor economy to raise military salaries in order to provide military personnel with purchasing power comparable to civilians.
Such considerations do not intrude upon the cerebrations of the Hoover Commission, who conclude by asking: “Is this [government enterprises] ‘creeping socialism’?” The answer is a model of its kind:
“Most of these projects were started for what, at the time, appeared to be justifiable operating reasons. Therefore, we cannot say that they were socialistic in intent. However, their perpetuation beyond the emergency period has led to the tremendous increase in the rate of growth of government wealth – as compared to private wealth – which the Harden Subcommittee cited. This is certainly an alarming symptom. Further, the rate is such as to suggest that ‘running’ is a more apt description than ‘creeping’.”
Not only is large-scale manufacturing prospering, but retail business is running about 8 per cent ahead of a year ago. Perhaps there has been some slight decline in the rate of profit, and perhaps small manufacturers are having their problems but, state the apologists of the bourgeoisie, 1955 will be the best or second-best year on record. Not only will we have “two cars in every garage” (who was it who said “two chickens in every pot”?), but eventually “every family will have three cars.” This pious wish is supposed to solve the problem of maintaining the present high rate of automobile sales in the latter part of the year.
The first signs of trouble occur as a rule, not merely in the difficulties that small businesses have in surviving, but in wholesale distribution. Marx puts it this way (Capital, Vol. III, p. 359):
Hence we note the phenomenon that crises do not show themselves, nor break forth, first in the retail business, which deals with direct consumption, but in the spheres of wholesale business and banking, by which the money-capital of society is placed at the disposal of wholesale business.
The manufacturer may actually sell to the exporter, and the exporter may in his turn sell to his foreign customer, the importer may sell his raw materials to the manufacturer, and the manufacturer his products to the wholesale dealer, etc. But at some particular and unseen point, the goods may lie unsold. On some other occasion, again, the supplies of all producers and middle men may become gradually overstocked. Consumption is then generally at its best either because one industrial capitalist sets a succession of others in motion, or because the laborers employed by them are fully employed and spend more than ordinarily ... the production of constant capital never takes place for its own sake, but solely because more of this capital is needed in those spheres of production whose products pass into individual consumption. However, this may proceed undisturbed for a while, stimulated by prospective demand, and in such lines the business of merchants and industrial capitalists prospers exceedingly. A crisis occurs whenever the returns of those merchants, who sell at long range, or whose supplies have accumulated also on the home market, become so slow and meager, that the banks press for payment, or the notes for the purchased commodities become due before they have been resold. It is then that forced sales take place, sales made in order to be able to meet payments. And then we have the crash, which brings the deceptive prosperity to a speedy end. (Italics mine. – T.N.V.)
To be sure, Marx was discussing the turnover of merchants’ capital in the above passage, and describing the development of crisis in a fairly simple, undifferentiated type of capitalism that prevailed a century ago. He could not have foreseen the development of the Permanent War Economy stage of capitalism in decline, where production of the means of destruction becomes an integral “third” department of the economic scene. Constant capital is currently not only produced when needed by industries “whose products pass into individual consumption,” but also – and with equal social acceptability – when needed by industries whose products enter into military consumption. In some cases, the individual product that enters into military consumption is identical with that which enters into individual consumption. The ability of the state thus to subsidize whole industries (mining, for example) materially helps to stabilize the entire economy.
Depending on the character and degree of state intervention in the economy, the traditional course of the capitalist business cycle becomes considerably modified. The possibilities of the boom culminating in sudden, abrupt crisis are remote so long as the political preconditions, nationally and internationally, of the Permanent War Economy obtain. Moreover, economic fact-gathering and knowledge have progressed to the point where any unsold goods are fairly conspicuous. They are either agricultural surpluses bursting out of government warehouses or automobiles bulging in dealers’ showrooms – to mention the two major points where quasi-crisis conditions are presently in the process of developing.
Nevertheless, Marx remains eminently correct in stating that crises tend to originate with the wholesale level of distribution. In this connection, it is most interesting to examine the latest figures on business failures (as published by Dun’s, op. cit., p. 32). There were 2,854 failures during the first quarter of 1955 compared with 2,895 during the first quarter of 1954 – a decline of almost two per cent in number of failures. The liabilities represented by these failures declined from $134.6 million to $121.1 million during the year under comparison – a decline of ten per cent. Yet, against this favorable performance for the economy as a whole, wholesale trade is the only sector of the economy where the number and dollar volume of failures rises significantly from the first quarter of 1954 to the first quarter of 1955. The number of failures in wholesale trade increased from 289 to 337 – a rise of 17 per cent; while the dollar volume of the liabilities involved in these failures rose from $12.9 million to $13.7 million – a rise in excess of 6 per cent.
By themselves, these figures could be merely episodic. Yet for the month of March – the latest month for which figures are available – business failures rose 12 per cent over February 1955. According to Dun’s, “Casualties were higher only once, in March 1954, in the entire postwar period.” This is the type of cloud on the horizon that may only be a speck today, but tomorrow can be very sizable.
 
THE FUNCTION OF DISTRIBUTION, the turnover of capital in retailing and wholesaling, is fundamentally to realize the values and surplus values embodied in capital employed in production. Only in this manner can the capitalist cycle of M–C–M be completed and the capitalist achieve the profit that is his sole aim in business. When production increases faster than consumption (unless military expenditures consume the entire disproportionate excess of production), there is another cloud on the horizon that is symptomatic of quasi-crisis if it continues to grow.
That all is not serene for the American capitalists may be seen from a glance at the figures on retail and manufacturing sales. Retail sales in 1946, the first postwar year, are reported at $102,488,000,000; in 1954 they were $170,664,000,000 – an increase of 67 per cent. Manufacturing sales, on the other hand, rose from $151,402,000,000 in 1946 to $287,707,000,000 in 1954 – an increase of 90 per cent. As a matter of fact, if the comparison is made with 1953, the postwar peak, the increase in retail sales remains the same, 67 per cent, while the increase in manufacturing sales reaches 100 per cent, as manufacturing sales for 1953 are estimated to have reached over $303 billion.
While a portion of the increase in manufacturing must go to replace the constant capital that has been used up in prior production, and a portion (about $20 billion) goes into increased inventory that is presumably salable, it is clear that a sizable portion of the increase in commodity production (capital) has been immobilized by the state principally in the form of military stockpiles and government storage of agricultural surpluses.
The use of state power, no matter how haphazard or inefficient it may be, for such equilibrium purposes introduces an aspect of planning into the anarchic system of capitalism that neither Marx, Lenin nor Trotsky could have foreseen in detail, as fundamentally the decisive aspects of state intervention and “planning” are products of the Permanent War Economy. Eliminate the threat of Stalinist imperialism, remove the social acceptability to all classes of the huge expenditures for war outlays, destroy the political basis for state intervention in the economy on such a huge scale, and the pre-World War II violent swings in the economy are immediately restored.
The “triumph” of American capitalism today lies not so much in its ability to maintain an historically outmoded social system, but its ability to persuade the masses of the population that the Permanent War Economy is really the Welfare State. This, however, is a separate subject outside the scope of this article.
Another way of expressing the fundamental economic developments that have taken place during the past decade as a result of the huge accumulation of capital is to refer to the increasingly high organic composition of capital, with its consequent rapid increase in productivity of labor. These tendencies we analyzed in Part III, Increasing State Intervention, of the original series on the Permanent War Economy (cf.
The New International, May–June 1951, p. 150):
“Precisely where the breaking point is likely to be, no one can say, but it is clear that the composition of capital is already dangerously high and constitutes a sword of Damocles, hanging over the unsuspecting head of such a highly-geared capitalist economy that in a few years it is possible to produce all the automobiles, television sets, etc., that can be sold under capitalist conditions of production.”
Labor productivity, according to an unpublished study of the Federal Reserve Research Department, may have reached the fantastic figure of between four and eight per cent last year in manufacturing, against a normal current rate of increase of three per cent. The resulting rise in national income has, in turn, given rise to significant increases in personal savings. The forms of savings have recently been studied by Raymond Goldsmith. As reported by Will Lissner in The New York Times of May 29, 1955,
“The information already developed has been credited with aiding in the formulation of policies that moderated recent tendencies toward boom and slump. Economists in close touch with the research going on predict that within five years enough will be known about the business cycle to banish major depression from the American economy.”
What these economists ought more profitably to study is how to sustain the economy once production of the means of destruction declines appreciably below present levels. This is not to be interpreted as a forecast that such will happen. The basic decisions are now political in nature. But the Stalinist peace offensive has as one of its objectives the promotion of a political climate in western Europe and the United States that will bring about a reduction in war outlays on the part of American capitalism. It is by no means excluded that the Stalinists will achieve some degree of success in this part of their strategic aim.
Without speculating about substantial reductions in war outlays, however, there are already evident signs of stress and strain in the field of distribution. The size of the average capital engaged in retail or wholesale trade is smaller than in manufacturing. Its return on sales is less, as it depends on a higher turnover of capital to maintain its share of the average rate of profit. By the same token, however, capital engaged in distribution is more vulnerable to minor changes in the business cycle. From the point of view of monopoly capital, the overwhelming majority of the almost four million enterprises engaged in retail and wholesale distribution are at best necessary evils. If a substantial percentage of merchants’ capital were to disappear, provided that the process did not rock the capitalist boat, monopoly capital would not be unduly concerned. Except for propaganda phrases, consequently, monopoly capital is not at all alarmed about the “mounting disadvantages facing the small-business man,” nor for that matter is monopoly capital the “vigorous defender of the free-enterprise system” that it poses as.
As a matter of historical record, the decisive majority of commodities intended for consumption by individuals is produced by a relatively small number of monopoly capitalists. These manufacturers, except in the case of a few large aggregations of merchants’ capital, are able to ignore with impunity the desires and aspirations of retailers and wholesalers. During the Great Depression of the 1930’s, when the capitalist structure was rocked to its foundations by the ravages of the crisis, monopoly capital engaged in the production of consumer goods sought legislation to enable it to withstand the vicissitudes of competition. The result was the passage of the Miller-Tydings Act of 1937, which exempted manufacturer-retailer price fixing contracts from anti-trust prosecution. This was really the origin of the Fair Trade movement, whereby monopoly capital attempted direct control of the pricing activities of merchants capital.
Under Fair Trade agreements, if a manufacturer enters into a minimum pricing agreement (price fixing agreement) with one retailer in one of the 48 states (there are at present 42 states where this monopoly practice is legal), all other retailers in that state who are selling the same commodity – whether they have signed a Fair Trade agreement or not – are bound to the schedule of prices dictated by the manufacturer. The main argument in favor of Fair Trade has always been that the manufacturer needs protection against those retailers (and wholesalers) who follow the practice of loss leaders; i.e., the manufacturer of a nationally branded and advertised product claims that he has spent considerable sums to establish consumer preference and desire for his product, and the “unscrupulous” retailer sells this product at a loss in order to lure customers into his store, on the theory that once they are in the store they will purchase other merchandise on which he makes his normal profit or more. Certain retailers, especially department stores, have been the main supporters of such price-fixing agreements, as they find it difficult to cope with the competition of specialty stores and discount houses who slash prices on branded merchandise. The fact that the consumer pays more under such monopoly practices as Fair Trade is, after all, relatively unimportant to the monopolist so long as his profit position is adequately maintained.
The legislative history is important in only one respect – as the supplies of civilian products on the market increased in the postwar period, advocates of Fair Trade attempted to solve the problem on a state by state basis, once the Supreme Court declared that the Miller-Tydings Act could not be used to support Fair Trade. They found, however, that this would not work as there was an immediate and obvious conflict with the Federal antitrust laws. Consequently, Congress passed the McGuire Act in 1952 which exempts state Fair Trade laws from the provisions of Federal anti-trust laws. The McGuire Act gives permission to monopoly capital to establish price-fixing agreements at the wholesale and retail level on a state by state basis without fear of prosecution under Federal anti-monopoly laws.
 
THE GROWTH OF FAIR TRADE has been accompanied by an immediate and parallel rise in discount houses, much like the passage of the Prohibition Act was accompanied by the growth of bootlegging. Discount houses are no longer confined to New York and a few large cities. They have spread across the entire country. Everyone is “discount-conscious.” Every commodity that has a list price, or suggested list price, or whose retail price can be established in the minds of the consumer through advertising or any other device, is immediately sold at a discount. The havoc that this process has caused among various types of distributive outlets has given rise to what may properly be termed a veritable crisis in distribution.
Discount houses are not to be confused with retail outlets that have periodic sales. A proper definition would have to confine the term to those retailers that are selling as a regular daily occurrence Fair-Traded merchandise at less than the Fair-Traded prices. How extensive is this practice? The surprising, or perhaps not so surprising, thing is that nobody knows. The estimates vary so widely as to be almost meaningless. Yet, unless there are some quantitative measures, it is impossible to analyze the current crisis in distribution.
The same Annual Report of the Senate Small Business Committee, previously cited, has an interesting chapter on the Distributive Trades, in which we find the following illuminating discussion of the extent of discount houses:
Various estimates have been made of the extent to which these discount houses have made inroads into more normal retail outlets. Spokesmen for the Toy Manufacturers’ Association and the National Retail Dry Goods Association, both of which operate in areas especially vulnerable to the competition of discounters, have provided your committee with their guess that the total sales volume of discount houses is about $5 billion. On the other hand, the United States Chamber of Commerce has given a figure of $25 billion, or five times as great, as its best guess of the extent of business being done by these outlets, most of whose business is done in fair-traded items. On this point, incidentally, the American Fair Trade Council feels that over 80 per cent of the discount houses’ revenue comes from prixe-fixed merchandise, and there seems to be no reason to doubt that the 80 per cent figure is close to the mark.
Your committee, however, has no means and no data by which it could come to a decision on the relative reliability of either the $5 billion or $25 billion annual revenue estimate. Since it is generally agreed that only 10 per cent of total retail sales in the Nation are in fair-traded goods, the total amount of such business would come to about $18.7 billion with total sales of $187 billion. (Dun’s figure for total retail sales is about $170 billion, but the difference is not significant for purposes of this analysis.) Therefore, it would seem that the Chamber of Commerce figure overstates the income of the discounter, but your committee is unable to find any mutually agreed upon level between the $5 billion and $25 billion estimates. Naturally, precise information is not available, since the discount houses do not file reports with any agency of the Government or with any private association regarding the extent of their sales. (Italics mine. – T.N.V.)
On the other hand, Housewares Review, a trade publication, in its May 1955 issue has an article by the editor on the Distribution Revolution. In it, he refers to 10,000 discount houses doing an annual volume of $500 million. To be sure, there are other types of discount operations, including supermarkets and mail order and catalog operations, but the figure given by Housewares Review for gross volume of discount houses looks like they placed the decimal in the wrong place. An annual volume of $500 million divided among 10,000 discount stores (the figure seems to be extremely conservative) would yield only $50,000 gross volume per store. A genuine discount house could not exist on such a small volume, as the key to a successful discount operation is large volume on a small mark-up, resulting in a much faster turnover of capital than the average retailer. Surely, a $500,000 average annual volume is more apt to be correct for the typical discount house than $50,000. On this assumption, the annual volume would be $5 billion, coinciding with the estimate of the Toy and Dry Goods Associations cited by the Senate Small Business Committee.
Whatever the actual figures, it is clear that a very substantial percentage of the volume of many commodities, especially certain types of consumer durables, is sold at discount. In fact, E.B. Weiss, one of the main trade analysts of “off-list” selling, in a comprehensive article in Advertising Age for April 18, 1955, states:
The president of Webster-Chicago had declared that “in the New York City area, 85 per cent of all major appliances were sold by discount houses in 1964.” That figure is correct as applied to the discount operation: not as applied to the discount house. He also said that the discount house is “tending to become more like a conventional dealer every day” – a statement that is not quite factual. A small handful of discount houses are opening more luxurious outlets and giving more services. But the total discount operation is far from conventional. If anything, the contrary would be a more accurate summation – in other words, the conventional outlet is tending toward the unconventionality of the discount operation – witness the circusy warehouse sales of department stores.
While, as Housewares Review puts it, “The factory list price, made into a legalized point of reference for the discounter, became the discounter’s chief asset,” the fact remains that the average discount house works on a gross margin of 10–20 per cent, whereas the average department store requires a mark-up at least twice that of the discount house. How does the discount house do it? Masters, one of New York’s largest discount houses, has made its figures publicly available. They are analyzed by Housewares Review, as follows:

Thus, assuming that merchandise costs are identical (and many of the large discount houses receive larger quantity discounts from most manufacturers than do department stores), the discount house has definitely lower selling costs, lower overhead, and above all lower payroll. With a margin of 20 percentage points, or thereabouts, there is little wonder that the average discount house can undersell the average department store by an appreciable amount – enough to attract the average consumer.
 
THE DISCOUNT HOUSE, and the discount method of operation, have been growing. This is not to imply that all discount houses are prospering and all department stores suffering. Many department stores are doing quite well, and recently a number of discount stores have gone into bankruptcy. Still, however, some old and honored names in retailing have disappeared from the scene: McCreery’s, Wanamaker’s and Hearns in New York, Loeser’s in Brooklyn, O’Neill’s in Baltimore, Famous of Los Angeles, and Alms & Doepke in Cincinnati. There is no doubt that a squeeze is beginning to operate on retail distribution. This is the central aspect of the crisis in distribution. The frantic seeking of other distributive outlets, the general chaos that prevails, are merely symptoms of the falling average rate of profit in distribution at large.
Fair Trade was supposed to have protected the profit margins of the distributor and retailer. Properly policed it was supposed to have eliminated the discounter. At least, that was the theory on which the manufacturer sold the concept to the retailer. When the Supreme Court ruled in 1951 that the Miller-Tydings Act of 1937 applied only to those retailers who actually signed price agreements with manufacturers, large-scale price wars broke out in most major cities, with the result that retailers took the lead, assisted by manufacturers, in pushing through the McGuire Act of 1952. The vote was overwhelming in Congress, 196 to 10 in the House and 64 to 16 in the Senate. Yet after three short years of operation, Fair Trade would seem to be on its way out.
States the Senate Small Business Committee, after reviewing the disparity of statistical estimates on the size of discounting:
Even with that degree of statistical uncertainty, though, it is apparent that discounters do account for a sizable share of the retailing pie. Furthermore, any increase in their sales during the coming year which even closely approximates the growth of the past 12 months will undoubtedly provide a most definite and pragmatic answer to the question of what happens next in the fair-trade puzzle. In the opinion of your committee, a more serious challenge to the fair-trade laws than was ever presented by any court decision arises in the shape of these ever-expanding operations of discount houses located in those States which have resale-price-maintenance laws.
Based on current observations, your committee concludes that favorable court actions against individual price cutters have proved ineffective in halting such retail outlets. While protracted litigation was under way which was aimed at forcing 1 operator to respect the fair-trade price of 1 manufacturer’s articles, hundreds and thousands of discount houses were cutting prices on hundreds and thousands of fair-traded articles.
This air of hopelessness of the official watchdog over the health of small business merely reflects the economics of the situation. Discounting on a large scale is here to stay. It exists not only with the tacit support of manufacturers, but with their complete cooperation. It goes without saying that discount houses could not survive for one day without the benevolent support of manufacturers. Many manufacturers supply discount houses openly. Many more use one or more indirect or surreptitious methods of supplying discount houses, so that they can piously inform their more conventional distributive outlets that “they” are not selling the discount houses.
 
THE ENORMOUS INCREASE in the productive capacity of American capitalism has led to a frantic search for every type of market. It is this which is fundamentally responsible for the chaotic condition in distribution. It should be clear that no legal device, Fair Trade or its repeal, or any other patented formula, can serve as a nostrum to remedy the crisis in distribution. Meanwhile, however, the government appears to be getting ready to sponsor repeal of Fair Trade.
The Federal Trade Commission recently, according to Electrical Merchandising (a McGraw-Hill publication) for April, 1955, in an article entitled, Is Fair Trade Dying?,
released a letter to retailers refusing to enforce state Pair Trade laws. And to add insult, the Commission advised retailers they could “with impunity” ignore the state laws where they were not being diligently enforced.
The FTC said that if a manufacturer persists in discriminatory or lax enforcement of his Fair Trade contracts “he has forfeited his rights to enforcement and there is no longer any legal obligation – or at least any legally enforceable obligation – upon a retailer to observe the manufacturer’s fixed prices.”
The commission went on to advise retailers to “resort to various avenues of self-help.” Among the avenues suggested: disregard the fixed price “and compete on a price basis with the discount house.”
The FTC concluded, “It cannot seriously be suggested that price competition is morally reprehensible. A retailer forced to cut prices to compete ... could do so with impunity.”
Hard on the heels of this FTC letter came Attorney General Brownell’s long-heralded and long-delayed study. Formed in 1953 to review the whole structure of anti-trust legislation, the Brownell committee was composed of 60 top lawyers and economists.
In strong words, the committee’s report attacked the federal laws which exempt Fair Trade agreements from antitrust action.
The report said, “We regard the Federal statutory exemption of Fair Trade pricing as an unwarranted compromise of the basic tenets of national anti-trust policy. The throttling of price competition in the process of distribution that attends Fair Trade pricing is, in our opinion, a deplorable yet inevitable concomitant of Federal exemptive laws.
“We therefore recommend Congressional repeal both of the Miller-Tydings amendment to the Sherman Act and the McGuire amendment to the Federal Trade Commission Act, thereby subjecting resale-price maintenance as other price-fixing practices, to those Federal anti-trust controls which safeguard the public by keeping the channels of distribution free.” (Italics mine. – T.N.V.)
The Administration is thus squarely behind repeal of Fair Trade. Whether immediate legislation will result is doubtful, but it makes little difference so far as the over-all problem is concerned. While some manufacturers will state that they favor continuation of Fair Trade, more and more retailers are moving in the direction of advocating repeal of Fair Trade.
In fact, Attorney General Brownell in a speech before the Annual Conference of the NRDGA (reported in Retailing Daily of April 4, 1955) tried to convince the department store owners (apparently, without too much resistance) that they would be aided in their fight against discount houses by repeal of Fair Trade.
He suggested that the discounter probably owes more to fair trade than anyone else since it gives him a fixed ceiling and makes it a simple matter to undersell those retailers bound by fair trade contracts....
“It may be that elimination of fair trade would hamper the operations of discounters to a greater extent than it would hurt those who have so earnestly sought the protection of fair trade!” ...
The Attorney General’s declaration constituted his first detailed discussion of fair trade “price-fixing” as the Justice Department sees it. Included in his reasoning were these fundamental points:
Although fair trade legislation was supposed to help small retailers compete with chain stores and other large outlets, “the anticipated benefits have been somewhat illusory.”
Fair trade handicaps those small retailers who cannot afford extensive advertising, or elaborate establishments or services and whose best hope of attracting customers is in charging lower prices ...
The argument of some manufacturers that fair trade is needed to protect the small merchant has “a somewhat false ring” when they admit they have engaged in manufacturing for sale under private brand an article identical, except for a different brand name, with the fair traded item.
One of his major conclusions was when “He said it  ‘seems evident’ that the absence of competitive pricing under fair trade results in higher prices for the consumer and that consumers are deprived of the opportunity of ‘shopping around’ for the same product priced competitively and advertised freely by different retailers.”
It would thus seem fairly clear that despite the development of state monopoly capitalism and the Permanent War Economy, with all the modifications that have taken place in the structure of capitalism, some of the basic laws of capitalism still operate. The trends toward concentration of capital, and its increasing organic composition, that Marx observed and analyzed are still at work. Competition is still cannibalistic in its impact, especially on smaller aggregations of capital. The crisis in distribution and its continuation are both inevitable and incurable. They are a reflection of the fact that American capitalism, despite its tremendous wealth, is in reality a sick economy.
The fact that capitalist crisis does not appear in traditional form, as a sudden curtailing of credit at the peak of a boom, with resultant forced liquidations on an extensive scale, does not at all mean that capitalism has solved the problem of the business cycle, or that capitalist prosperity is permanent. On the contrary, as we have repeatedly observed, unless there is a constantly increasing ratio of war outlays to total output, the equilibrium becomes more and more precarious until it is finally upset.
The dead weight of mass unemployment will become more and more a powerful social and political lever, despite the fact that the increase in unemployment is uneven and gradual, and despite the fact that the labor movement has lost much of its militancy. In 1949, unemployment reached a postwar peak averaging 3.4 million for the year. The equilibrium of the economy was certainly endangered at that point. But, fortunately for American capitalism, the Korean war was launched by Stalin at just the right time. Unemployment which had averaged 3.1 million in 1950, declined to 1.9 million in 1951, 1.7 million in 1952, and 1.5 million in 1953, but in 1954 unemployment rose to an average of 3.2 million.
It is impossible to predict at what level (four, five or six million) unemployment will become such a dead weight on the entire economy that the far-reaching nature of the present crisis will be apparent to all. The fate of small business may be of only passing interest to monopoly capital, but its decline tends to aggravate the unemployment problem, and of course its demise is hastened by rising unemployment. If 1955 becomes the most prosperous (profitable) or the second-most prosperous (profitable) year in the history of American capitalism, with unemployment remaining at about the three million level, then what will happen to unemployment when there is a 5–10 per cent decline in production? And the crisis in distribution is a sure sign that in the not-too-distant future there will be a fall-off in production!



 
May 1955


T.N. Vance
 



 



While Berle’s 20th Century Capitalist Revolution [1] has been loudly criticized by all types of critics as a very shallow and superficial study – one which fundamentally repudiates his basic work on the modern corporation which he wrote together with Means in 1939 – it would be a mistake to dismiss his series of lectures as merely a panegyric in favor of the large corporation and state monopoly capitalism. That, of course, it is, but Berle does succeed in raising some very interesting questions even if he cannot provide the answers.
Moreover, in passing and in developing his general thesis, Berle provides some very interesting and useful information. For example, he quotes fairly extensively from a study on concentration of economic power by Professor M.A. Adelman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in which it is stated that “135 corporations own 45 per cent of the industrial assets of the United States – or nearly one-fourth of the manufacturing volume of the entire world. This represents a concentration of economic, ownership greater perhaps than any yet recorded in history.” Adelman seems to be of the opinion that this is a relatively static situation with little change from year to year. Berle indicates at the end that he is not entirely in agreement. It is clear, of course from the current merger movement that the situation is far from static.
Berle is concerned with the fact that in most industries:
“Two or three, or at most, five corporations will have more than half the business, the remainder being divided among a greater or lesser number of smaller concerns who must necessarily live within the conditions made for then by the ‘big two’ or ‘big three’ or ‘big five’ as the case may be.”
In other words, no matter what figures are cited, as Berle says,
“There will be little dispute however, with the main conclusion: considerably more than half of all American industry – and that the most important half – is operated by ‘concentrates.’ Slightly more than half is owned outright by not more than 200 corporations. This is calculated on the coldest basis – the amount of actual assets owned by the corporations involved.”
There is, of course, nothing new in this brief description of concentrated capital accumulation in the United States. What is new is Berle’s assertion that progress in the interests of the entire population, not only of the United States but of the world at large, rests upon these 200 private corporations, who are performing a constructive role in helping to organize the entire process of industrial production and distribution. At one point, Berle puts it this way:
“Mid-twentieth-century capitalism has been given the power and the means of more or less planned economy, in which decisions are or at least can be taken in the light of their probable effect on the whole community.”
In other words, Berle has discovered state monopoly capitalism and has declared that the assumptions of multiple competing units that were the foundation of Adam Smith and classical bourgeois economics no longer hold true. Consequently, the “judgment of the market place” is no longer – in Berle’s opinion the motive power of the economy.
Berle also perform a useful function in calling attention to the study by the National City Bank on sources of capital accumulation. This study covering the eight years from 1946 through 1953, estimates that a total of $150 billion was spent for what might termed capital expenditures, namely, modernizing and enlarging plant and equipment. Sixty-four per cent of the total of $150 billion came from “internal sources” – that is to say from – surplus and depreciation reserves. Of the total of $99 billion financed through such “internal sources,”retained earnings were by far the largest proportion. Of the remaining $51 billion, or 36 per cent of the total, according to Berle, one-half was raised by current borrowing, chiefly bank credit. This accounts for about $25½ billion.
Of the remainder, $18 billion or 12 per cent of the grand total was raised by issue of bonds or notes. Although half of this amount was probably privately placed, Berle is willing to admit that a large portion of this capital was forced to run the gauntlet of so-called “market-place judgment” The astonishing fact is that “6 per cent or $9 billion out of a total of $150 billion was raised by issue of stock, Here, and here only, do we begin to approach the ‘risk capital’ investment so much relied on by classic economic theory. Even here a considerable amount was as far removed from ‘risk’ as the situation permitted: without exact figures, apparently a majority of the $9 billion was represented by preferred stock. Probably not more than $5 billion of the total amount was represented by common stock – the one situation in which an investor considers an enterprise, decides on its probable usefulness and profitability, and puts down his savings, aware of a degree of risk but hoping for large profit.
“There is substantial evidence, which need not be reviewed here, that this is representative of the real pattern of the twentieth-century capitalism. The capital is there; and so is capitalism. The waning factor is the capitalist. He has somehow vanished in great measure from the picture, and with him has vanished much of the controlling force of his market-place judgment. He is not extinct: roughly a billion dollars a year (say five per cent of total savings) is invested by him; but he is no longer a decisive force. In his place stand the boards of directors of corporations, chiefly large ones, who retain profits and risk them in expansion of the business along lines indicated by the circumstances of their particular operation. Not the public opinion of the market place with all the economic world from which to choose, but the directorial opinion of corporate managers as to the line of greatest opportunity within their own concern, now chiefly determines the application of risk capital. Major corporations in most in-stances do not seek capital. They form it themselves.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The existence of what is sometimes termed monopolistic competition or oligopoly or any of the other choice phrases used, does not of course mean that capitalists no longer exist. But Berle is correct in pointing out that capitalism has changed its form considerably during the twentieth century, and capitalism has introduced an aspect of planning which was surely not envisaged by Marx or early Marxists.
There is, above all, the role of the state which makes present-day capitalism differ qualitatively from nineteenth or even very early twentieth-century capitalism. Berle correctly points out, for example, that “the development of atomic energy, perhaps the crest of the next great wave in modern development, was not socialist by theory or by design. It was twentieth-century capitalism in respect of which the government played a major part, as it will continue to do.”
The role of the state in modern state monopoly capitalism in the United States is not confined to Democratic administrations. There has been no significant change under the present Republican administration either in fact or in theory.
As a matter of fact, even in Eisenhower’s Economic Report to Congress of January 20, 1955, which is devoted mainly to assuring the bourgeoisie that everything is fine and there is really very little to worry about, there is a type of recognition of the role of the state which certainly could not have been present in any official document of the last Republican administration. The economic report, after raising various questions concerning the shortness and mildness of the recent economic decline, implies that the government, i.e., the state, is really the factor that is different in the situation today and basically responsible for preventing a severe depression along classical lines. The report states:
“Clearly, many people had a part in stemming the economic decline and easing the readjustment from war to peace. The Federal government also contributed significantly to the process of recovery. It influenced the economy in two principal ways, first, through the automatic workings of the fiscal system, second, by deliberately pursuing monetary, tax, and expenditure policies that inspired widespread confidence on the part of the people and thus helped them to act in ways that were economically constructive.”
There can be little doubt that so-called fiscal policy, especially with reference to tax structure, and monetary and credit policy, did enable the state to play a constructive role in so far as helping to maintain general economic, equilibrium is concerned. The important word, however, in the passage quoted above is the word “expenditure” for it relates to government expenditures and here we find ourselves face to face with reality. What type of recovery from the so-called recession 1958-54 would have taken place had Federal government not been spending $50 billion or more per year on war outlays? It suffices to raise the question to realize that none of the platitudes of the theoreticians of the bourgeoisie can begin to cope with the recent situation. The economy is maintaining itself and giving an outward appearance of health – although inwardly extremely sick – only because capitalism has entered what we have previously described as the stage of Permanent War Economy.
That is why it is somewhat pathetic to find an outstanding bourgeois economist like Sumner Slichter of Harvard state in the current issue of the Harvard Business Review that the old-fashioned business cycle has in effect disappeared. The implication would seem to be that American capitalists have become super-intelligent and can now eliminate depressions. Slichter refers to many points in reaching this rather remarkable conclusion, such as developments in the financing of construction, and the so-called development of individual cycles of different industries. He also refers to the fact that durable goods industries “will at all times have a far higher ratio of unfilled orders to sales and inventories than prevailed in pre-Korean days.” One reason for this, according to the New York Times of January 23, 1955, is “the defense program ... [but] .. . even if diplomacy in the next few years succeeds in substantially mitigating the vigor of the cold war, I suspect that the volume of unfilled orders in the durable goods industry will be kept high simply as a matter of national policy.”
Slichter continues, according to the New York Times, by stating:
“In the unlikely event that a large additional drop in defense spending becomes possible, the country will probably offset the drop in defense spending by a long-term development program.”
What Slichter is saying, of course, is that the state will continue to support the Permanent War Economy – and if, in the unlikely event that international economic conditions change so as to render socially unnecessary the large-scale expenditures in the means of destruction, then the state will find other types of investments which will help to maintain the economy. Here he is reverting to a theory which he promulgated about 1930-31 which, had he been right then, would have meant that it would have been impossible for mass unemployment to have developed. Slichter is no more right today than he was in the 1930’s. The only socially acceptable large-scale state expenditures are those which do not compete with private capital and those which are absolutely and unmistakably essential to the preservation of the capitalist class. Such expenditures, so far, have only been found in the new third category of economic investment, namely, means of destruction. Yet, we should not lose sight of the fact that one of the essentials of state monopoly capitalism is that there is an unusual degree of state intervention in the economy which permits achieving stability, or relative stability, in many cases that could not have previously been attained. Of course, to do this the capitalists must have the support of other sections of the population, particularly of the labor movement. So far this has not been difficult for them to achieve.
What will happen during the year 1955 and into 1956 as the pressure of mass unemployment constantly grows remains to be seen. Already, there are signs that the leadership is being forced to take cognizance of the fact that there are several million unemployed and that these are not people who are superfluous to the normal functionings of capitalism – but who have been rendered superfluous by the very rapid accumulation of capital which, as Marx pointed out, necessarily brings about a certain increase in the industrial reserve army.
Or, as we have demonstrated previously, under the Permanent War Economy the basic Marxism law of accumulation of capital becomes transformed into a relative decline in the standard of living rather than an absolute increase in unemployment but as we have had occasion more recently to point out, this holds only when there is a steady increase in the ratio of war outlays. At the present time the ratio of war outlays has been declining, if only slightly, so that whereas a year ago it ran around 17 per cent, today it is down to around 15 per cent. The pressures that develop, particularly in basic industries, are apparent in such cities and industrial centers as Detroit, Pittsburgh, etc.
A process of attrition has developed. To revert to our analogy used in our original presentation of the nature and structure of the Permanent War Economy (see Part III, Increasing State Intervention, New International, May–June 1951):
“The restoration of the rate of profit could not be followed by an abandonment of state intervention. On the contrary, like a patient who has recovered from an almost fatal illness solely by taking medicine containing habit-forming drugs, the enduring ‘health’ of capitalism demands the continuation of the ‘habit-forming drug’ of state intervention. This becomes obvious as the economy of depression is followed by the Permanent War Economy. There are differences, however. Not only is state intervention more expensive, but it is no longer confined to restoring the profitability of ‘sick’ industries: The most decisive sections of capital are subjected to state control and direction, but the reward is the virtual guarantee of the profits of the bourgeoisie as a class.”
To maintain the precarious equilibrium that exists, constantly increasing state intervention is necessary. This is a fundamental law of the present epoch of capitalism – the Permanent War Economy. Not even Old Guard Republicans can defy this law and escape its consequences. Thus, we have the Eisenhower Administration talking about a 100 billion program for road building, and similar measures – most of which will naturally remain confined to paper and which will be trotted out every year around November when elections take place. There will, however, be state intervention in the economy so long as it is within the power of the bourgeoisie to use this new weapon to preserve its own historically outmoded system.
Not all bourgeois economists are optimistic about the outlook for economy as a whole as the official prognosticators in Washington. For example, an article in the New York Times under date of January 27, 1955 is headlined, Economists Wary of Business in ’55. The sub-headline is even more to the point: Their Testimony Casts Doubt on Eisenhower Optimism. There were eight private economists who testified before the Joint Congressional Committee on the Economic Report and not all of them represented the trade-union movement. They all appeared to be worried by what in some quarters is loosely referred to as automation which is simply a high-sounding public relations word for a process which has been going on for many years – even if it is accelerating now in certain industries and results in an increasingly high organic composition of capital. This is inherent in the nature of capitalism and should not cause surprise to those who presumably understand, more or less, how the capitalist system operates. It means that in a situation where business as a whole is good, where the bourgeoisie is making very high profits, there could be mass unemployment amounting very easily to a figure of 5,000,000 at the end of 1955. This gives rise not only to much uneasiness within the labor movement and pressures on the labor bureaucracy to do something about it, so that they in turn begin to exert pressure on Washington, but it also gives rise to such phenomena which are appropriate for this period in the form of renewed promises to investigate the “new trend toward monopoly and the concentration of economic power.” There will be, without question, many types of Congressional investigations this field. Whether any of them will add materially to the work of the temporary National Economic Committee remains to be seen, but the New York Times of January 24 reports that the sub-committee of the Committee of the Judiciary, in a report submitted by its majority, Senators Langer, Kefauver and Kilgore, stated that their hearings had lead them to two conclusions:
“(1) That there is a two-pronged drive by private monopoly to destroy public competition in the power business, and that the Dixon-Yates contract is a part of that drive. (2) The Wall Street domination of the power industry has revived many of the monopolistic holding company evils which Congress sought by legislation to suppress, particularly the extension of monopoly control over very wide regions.”
Here we have the makings of a great debate which may very well play an important role in the elections of 1956.
Mr. Berle, however, would answer to all of this that while the large corporation must adopt a conscience comparable to that of the king in feudal days, it is the engine of progress not only in domestic affairs but in international affairs. It is at this point that Mr. Berle, trying to pursue a pre-conceived thesis, becomes a simple apologist for state monopoly capitalism in its most rapacious form, with its justification of the oil cartels and similar international agreements.
He still, however, manages to flirt with important thoughts when he virtually concludes his essay by stating:
“Corporations still have, perhaps, some range of choice: they can either take an extended view of their responsibility, or a limited one. Yet the choice is probably less free than would appear. Power has laws of its own. One of them is that when one group having power declines or abdicates it, some other directing group immediately picks it up; and this appears constant throughout history. The choice of corporate management is not whether so great a power shall cease to exist; they can merely determine whether they will serve as the nuclei of its organization or pass it over to someone else, probably the modern state.”
Since the power of the state should be kept to a minimum, according to Berle and the traditional liberal philosophy, it is obvious that corporate power must be built up and maintained, but the corporate managers should please have a social conscience to that it would really be true for the former president of General Motors to say that “What is good for General Motors is good for the country.”
Sermons are interesting to those who like them but only in their proper place, and an essay on the twentieth-century capitalist revolution is hardly the place for Berle’s type of propagandistic sermon. His critics, however, have sufficiently well disposed of him so that we can merely state that there has been a type of revolution in the twentieth century but Berle doesn’t understand its nature, its causes or its probable results.
The constant decline in factory employment focuses attention on one of the major problems of American capitalism – and one for which there is no solution in sight. PWE (permanent war economy) or WPA (work relief projects) have actually been the only two solutions that capitalism has had to offer for the last 25 years. An entire generation has grown up and come to maturity which can only know from reading, but never from experience, what the old capitalism was like. This does not make the new capitalism less capitalist, but it does mean that some of its laws of motion and methods of operation are different and require analysis and understanding – especially by socialists.
Symptomatic of danger ahead for the economy, is a most interesting article that was published in the New York Times of September 20, 1954. The heading was Per Capita Output Only 1 per cent Above ’47. This is an article by one of the New York Times’ economic reporters, Burton Crane, and one which is highly recommended to Mr. Berle and to all students of the economy. It is worth quoting from fairly extensively:
Per capita industrial production in this country has dropped so sharply in the last year that it is only 1 per cent above the average rate for 1947 ...
The question facing the economy is whether industrial production and gross national product can be allowed to fall farther below the normal trend. Our economy, as observers of all shades of political thought have pointed out, works best when it is expanding. Signs that the dynamism had disappeared might discourage investors from risking their capital and dissuade industrialists from expanding their enterprises.
There are warnings that such attitudes may be in prospect. Expenditures for new plant and equipment, expressed in constant dollars and weighted for population changes, in the first half of 1954 were at 113 per cent of the 1947 level. In the two preceding years they had been at 116 and 123 per cent.
What is the normal upward trend in our economy due to growing mechanization and efficiency? Some economists have set it as high as 3.5 per cent for manufacturing production. At that annual improvement factor, per capita industrial production in 1954 should be at 127.2 per cent of 1947 output. It is at 101 per cent. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The twentieth-century capitalist revolution is thus not so earth-shaking as would appear from Mr. Berle’s panegyric. It has not solved the problem of unemployment. Here is one of the essential contradictions of capitalism under the Permanent War Economy only where, with attrition setting in, some of the basic laws of capitalism begin to reassert themselves. The economy must constantly grow and expand, at least to the point where it can support the 600,000 to 700,000 new entrants into the labor force each year. This it is obviously failing to do. Moreover, the two prime sources of economic infection, the agricultural crisis and the crisis in consumer durable goods (centering in the automobile industry), clearly remain – with no alleviation in sight. Many factors have been responsible for the rapid increase in population, and it is clear that the Permanent War Economy is intimately connected with this sociological phenomenon. The increase in population in turn, however, gives rise to the very correct analysis of Mr. Crane, quoted above, that only a per capita approach becomes meaningful in appraising the economy, its performance and its outlook. The American economy is simply not suited, nor large enough (on a capitalist basis) to provide the constantly expanding market that is required to sustain an expanding capitalism.
We are, therefore, back where we started and Mr. Berle is at least partially aware of this central problem when he speaks of “A modern corporation thus has become an international as well as a national instrument.” And when he observes that, “The present political framework of foreign affairs is nationalist. The present economic base is not. The classic nation-state is no longer capable, by itself alone, either to feed and clothe its people, or to defend its own borders.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Here, then, is the central fact of the modern capitalist “revolution.” Capitalism has visibly, before our very eyes, outgrown its national framework and must burst this integument asunder in one form or another. The only question that history must still answer is the form in which the capitalist national state will be destroyed and the nature of the political organization that will succeed it.

The general law of accumulation of capital under the Permanent War Economy [see January–February issue, Basic Characteristics of the Permanent War Economy] is that an increase in capital, instead of causing an increase in unemployment, is accompanied by relatively full employment and declining standards of living. This new and fundamental law of motion increasingly governs all human and class relations under this latest stage in the decline of capitalist society. Because of its tremendous significance we shall attempt to develop the key quantitative measures, however rough and approximate, so as to permit analysis of the various factors underlying the decline in living standards.
Having already obtained total war outlays, both direct and indirect, and the net value of current production, in order to measure the relationship between war outlays, and total output, our starting point in deriving a measure of the average standard of living is clearly to subtract total war outlays from net national product. The difference between the two series, by definition, represents the net output of civilian goods and services. If, from this result, we then subtract net private (civilian) capital formation – a necessary step since net private capital investment is included in total production, and capital in any of its forms does not directly satisfy human wants – we then have a measure of total civilian output of consumer goods and services as produced by both private and government sources.
It is only from this portion of total output, equivalent conceptually to the summation of personal consumption expenditures and government nonwar purchases, that the ingredients comprising the standard of living can come. For, aside from conceptual and statistical limitations inherent in many of the components of gross national product, especially as calculated by the Department of Commerce, the total output of consumer goods and services (shown in column five of Table I) theoretically expresses the market value of nil commodities consumed by consumers. Unless food, clothing, housing, consumer durables, etc., etc. are purchased by consumers and, it must be assumed, thereby consumed, production does not currently and directly satisfy human wants and is therefore outside our definition of standard of living.
In other words, we make a sharp distinction between personal wealth and standard of living. The former indicates possession or ownership that may ultimately be converted into consumption of want-satisfying commodities. But savings, factories, stores, real estate, and other forms of capital or property, including money, cannot be eaten or worn or utilized to satisfy human wants unless they are first transformed from exchange values into use values or employed to produce use values capable of directly entering into the process of human consumption. It is true that the greater one’s personal wealth, the higher his standard of living. This, however, does not follow because personal wealth is directly consumed by its owner, except in the rare case where a capitalist lives by using up his principal, but rather as a result of high personal incomes which simultaneously permit high consumption and accumulation of personal wealth or claims upon capital. The true gauge, therefore, of relative standards of living is the amount of commodities and services, both material and intangible, economic and cultural, actually consumed.
Table I portrays civilian output of consumer goods and services from 1939 to 1953, the first step in computing standards of living under the Permanent War Economy.

*Estimated, with 1950 data based on first half actuals. Projections of net national
product and total war outlays were explained in the previous article.



Net private capital formation was obtained by taking gross investment, as reported by the Department of Commerce, and subtracting from it Commerce’s figures for capital consumption allowances. The projections were based on a study of the individual components and are consistent, both as to understatement of price inflation and the magnitude of war outlays and their impact on capital accumulation, with the methods used to forecast war outlays and total output. If anything, our forecast minimizes the quantity of private capital that may be expected to be accumulated during 1951–1953, thus maximizing the volume of consumer goods and services that will be available for civilian consumption. This was deliberately done in order to present the trend in the average standard of living in as favorable a light as possible.
 
THAT CIVILIAN STANDARDS HAVE lagged well behind total output can readily be seen by comparing columns five and one in Table I. Over the entire period, from 1939 to 1953, the net value of production will have increased 3.6 times in current dollars, while the portion available for civilian consumption will have risen less than 2.8 times. It is axiomatic that production for war purposes cannot contribute to civilian standards of living. During the first fifteen years of the Permanent War Economy a total of almost $659 billion will have been spent on direct and indirect war outlays, an average of $44 billion each year. Even if full allowance is made for the production of food, clothing and other consumer goods for the armed forces, and granting as much validity as possible to the socially necessary character of certain indirect war outlays, it is still impossible to escape the conclusion that approximately three years total production has been completely wasted. Had it been possible for a rational economic system to have prevailed, producing and distributing an equivalent amount of commodities to consumers, the national debt of $257 billion could be completely retired and a dividend of $10,000 could be allotted to each family!
It may be wondered why we have not confined our measure of the average standard of living to personal consumption expenditures expressed in constant dollars on a per capita basis. Such an approach, usually without considering the growth in population, is generally adopted by those who seek to depict the “benefits of a free enterprise economy.” This could provide a first approximation provided that proper allowance was made for changes in the price level, but it would entirely omit from consideration the contribution made by the various levels of government to the average standard of living. Government nonwar purchases of goods and services, especially expenditures by state and local governments for education, utilities, transportation, and similar services, including the net postal deficit, are supported by taxes (except when government operates at a deficit) and presumably benefit more or less equally the entire population. While there may always be room for improvement, it must be assumed that such expenditures are an integral part of the average individual’s total want satisfactions and therefore of his standard of living. As a matter of fact, to the extent that such government services are provided free of charge and therefore excluded from personal consumption expenditures or simultaneously included in capital formation as part of new public construction activity (school buildings, public hospital buildings, highways, etc.), the contribution of government to the average standard of living is understated.
Nevertheless, we could have added government nonwar purchases to personal consumption expenditures and theoretically obtained an identical result for civilian output of consumer goods and services. There are two major reasons why this procedure was not followed, aside from the minor inconvenience that would be caused by the failure of Commerce to publish the breakdown between Federal war and nonwar purchases since 1946: (1) our estimate of total war outlays is higher than that of Commerce chiefly, as explained in the previous article, because of our inclusion of the concept of “indirect” war outlays; and (2) while, on balance, the official figures for total output, as represented by the national product series, appear to be reasonable, we take exception to the inclusion and exclusion of certain items and to the classification of owner-occupied residential construction as a capital expenditure.
Thus, for example, we see no justification for the inclusion of imputed rent (of owner-occupied houses), imputed interest, or payments in kind in a national product series that is attempting to estimate the market value of current production. One might just as logically include the imputed value of housewives’ services. This type of inclusion tends to overstate both total output and consumer outlay. On the other hand, exclusion of virtually all the expenditures of the Veterans Administration, net government interest payments and government subsidies tends to understate total output (to the extent that such activities, like any other government activity, are supported by taxes) and total war outlays. The exclusions, in general, ought to be reflected in total output but not in consumer output, as for the most part they belong to the war sector. To treat residential construction (except when it is income-producing property) as part of capital formation is to identify wealth with capital and to betray a lack of understanding of the nature and functioning of capital. One might just as well include any other consumer durable possessed of a relatively long lifetime, such as personal passenger cars, radios, television sets, furniture, etc. Owner-occupied residential construction, therefore, ought to be shifted from gross private domestic investment to personal consumption expenditures.
In short, we feel that the official figures for personal consumption expenditures are overstated by approximately the same amount as total war outlays are understated. This is particularly true for 1946, where our biggest difference of more than $12 billion occurs. Consequently, the method used to obtain civilian output of consumer goods and services maintains a proper aggregate for total production while at the same time assuring a more realistic apportionment between the war and civilian sectors of the economy. It also enjoys the additional merit of facilitating the projection of Chilian output of consumer goods and services. The residual method employed does, it is true, understate the level of government nonwar purchases, particularly since 1915, but we prefer to maintain the official series for personal consumption expenditures rather than to make all the adjustments that would be required to conform with our criticisms. There is no difference in the average standard of living and the differences in per capita standards of living by classes would be negligible.
 
IT MAY BE HELPFUL AT THIS POINT to present the figures for personal consumption expenditures, both because they are by far the largest component in the formation of the average standard of living and because we subsequently base our class analysis of trends in living standards on a class breakdown of the official data for personal consumption expenditures. What consumers are officially reported to have spent in current dollars from 1939–1949, together with our projections for 1950–1953, is shown in Table II, which also expresses consumer outlay in constant dollars by using the BLS Consumers’ Price Index as deflator.

*Estimated with 1950 based on first nine months actuals. A report of the Department
of Commerce, published in The New York Times of December 31, 1950 indicates that
personal consumption expenditures for 1950 are estimated at “about $190 billion.”
The projections are consistent with the methods used to forecast output and make
only partial allowance for rising prices in 1951 and almost none in 1952 and 1953.



It will be noted that the trend in personal consumption expenditures is not too dissimilar from that shown by civilian output of consumer goods and services, with the noteworthy exception of 1945–1947. As a matter of overall comparison, during the entire period from 1939 to 1953, personal consumption expenditures will increase almost three times on a current dollar basis, whereas our series for civilian output of consumer goods and services rises 2.8 times, hardly a significant difference. Far more important in evaluating what has happened to the average standard of living is the allowance made for the increase in consumer prices. The Chamber of Commerce of the United States, for example, in a recent pamphlet entitled Policies and Controls in a War-Burdened Economy, obviously uses the BLS Consumers’ Price Index as its measure of changes in prices paid by consumers and thus is able to conclude that “real consumer purchasing power also increased (during the war)!” While there was a slight increase during the war, to indicate that there was a 41 per cent rise in real consumer purchasing power or the average standard of living between 1939 and 1945 is highly misleading, just as much as to indicate that the average consumer in 1950 was more than 65 per cent better off than in 1939.
The Consumers’ Price Index for Moderate Income Families in Large Cities of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, despite its widespread use by trade unions in collective bargaining contracts as a measure of the rise in the cost of living to which wage rates are linked, is not an accurate indicator of changes in the average cost of living, especially of factory workers. It may record fairly accurately typical consumer price trends in a period when government controls and inflationary shortages are non-existent, but in the epoch of the Permanent War Economy it is extremely insensitive to quality depreciation, evasions of controls, changes in controls, and the disappearance or relative disappearance of basic consumer commodities from the market. Moreover, it fails utterly to take into account changes in consumer buying habits and consumption patterns. Since 1941 it has markedly understated the rise in the average cost of living, with the deviations from reality becoming cumulative. Accordingly, any attempt to assess changes in living standards by the use of the Consumers’ Price Index necessarily lacks validity.
It is obvious, however, that analysis of standards of living cannot be intelligently undertaken on the basis of current dollars and that we must discuss in terms of dollars possessing constant purchasing power. We therefore need a price index that reflects as accurately as possible the changes in average prices paid by average consumers. Unfortunately, no such index exists and we are reluctantly compelled to devise one arbitrarily. This has been done by calculating the arithmetic average between the Consumers’ Price Index and the BLS Wholesale Price Index, on the theory that the former represents the minimum change in consumer price levels and the latter the maximum possible change due to the well-known greater flexibility of wholesale prices compared with retail prices. The arbitrary part of the approach consists in giving equal weight to both indexes, whereas it may well be that one should weigh more heavily than the other in trying to achieve our objective. We are aware of no evidence, however, that would warrant unequal weighting. [1]
It is necessary to emphasize that the selection of a price index far outweighs any other factor in analyzing living standards. If, for example, we had applied the Consumers’ Price Index to our series on civilian output of consumer goods and services, the results would not differ too greatly from, the picture shown in Table II. For 1950, the growth in the consumption sector of the economy would be 52.6 per cent over 1939 instead of 65.7 per cent. Our thesis that the workers have suffered a decline in their living standards as a result of the Permanent War Economy would be greatly weakened, even though a relative decline compared with the growth in total output is apparent.
 
WE NOW PROCEED TO THE SECOND basic step in our analysis, which is to develop an index of the output of the consumption sector of the economy, by which term we distinguish from the war sector and the capital sector. The results are shown in Table III.

‡ Average of column two above and column three of Table II.



While the wholesale price index evidences the same difficulty in surmounting official failure to recognize the prevalence of black markets during price control as does the Consumers’ Price Index, it is a much more comprehensive and more sensitive index. Our derived average price index, except for the later stages of the war, is probably as satisfactory a measure of price changes in the consumption sector as can be obtained. A 35 per cent rise in the output of the consumption sector from 1939 to 1950 is certainly more plausible than a 65 per cent rise. Moreover, our series now shows a decline in consumption output from 1941 to 1942–43, as well as a decline from 1946 to 1947, both movements conforming far more closely to common experience than the highly misleading series represented by personal consumption expenditures deflated by the Consumers’ Price Index.
It is thus apparent that the rise in output of consumer goods and services, from both private and government sources, rose very modestly indeed during the war. With the exception of 1947, which was a year of unbridled inflation following the abandonment of price control in 1946, there was then a further steady growth until the outbreak of the Korean war. Now, we can expect a noticeable decline in 1951 followed by a leveling off at about the 1950 rates in 1952–53 – this, on the basic assumption stipulated in the projection of war outlays that the armed forces of the United States will not be engaged in any major conflict prior to 1954. It will be noted that the movement of real consumption output (the basis of all living standards) follows the trends in the ratio of war outlays to total output – but in reverse. This is only natural inasmuch as war output must take place at the expense of civilian output unless there is a corresponding increase in total output, which is never possible and which at the present historic juncture is severely limited in its potential by a whole host of factors.
The relative decline in standards of living is beyond dispute, regardless of the figures chosen or statistical methods used. Even if one were to deflate total output by the wholesale price index, on the ground that price inflation in the war and capital sectors of the economy is more severe under the Permanent War Economy than in the consumption sector, the contrast is obvious and dramatic in its implications. Consider the following brief tabulation, which deflates total output as reflected by net national product (column one of Table I) by the BLS wholesale price index (column two of Table III) in comparison wtih our index of consumption output in 1939 dollars for the key historical years in our fifteen-year period:

From 1939 to 1945, or during World War II, total real output in the United States rose 78 per cent, while the output of the consumption sector increased but 18 per cent. Had such a phenomenal increase in production been possible without the stimulus provided by the war or, in other words, had the rise in consumption kept pace with the upsurge in production, there would have been a further 50 per cent increase in the output of consumer goods and services from both private and government sources! In spite of the idle resources that existed at the outbreak of the war, the expansion of the war sector necessitated an actual decline in certain types of consumer production such as automobiles, radios, refrigerators, most consumer durables, and even some types of clothing and food, not to mention many services, especially those made available by government. Had the war lasted much longer, it is highly probable that the great lag in consumption output compared with total output would have been followed by an absolute decline in the output of consumer goods and services.
History under the Permanent War Economy has so far been very kind to the American capitalist class. The major turns have occurred at just the right time. World War II lasted long enough, but not too long. Sharp class dissensions were thus avoided. In the postwar period from 1945 to 1950, there was a further growth in consumption output of 15 per cent. The rate of growth in the production of consumer goods and services was thus maintained at about 3 per cent per annum. Since, at the same time, there was a decline of 19 per cent in total output, by 1950 output in the consumption sector had almost caught up with total production, the relative lag in growth being only 6 per cent. Maintenance of these trends for another year would have resulted in a reversal of position, with the growth in consumption output exceeding the increase in total production. Under capitalist conditions of production, a first-rate crisis would have developed by the end of 1951, thereby revealing that a 10 per cent ratio of war outlays to total output is inadequate to sustain economic equilibrium at a high level for more than a limited number of years. As we have previously indicated, the outbreak of the Korean war came in the nick of time. The threatened crisis due to relative overproduction of consumer goods was averted and the dominance of the Permanent War Economy guaranteed.
The current increase in the ratio of war outlays to total output will bring to a halt the steadily rising trend in the output of consumer goods and services. While we expect a leveling off to take place until such time as American imperialism is engaged in full-scale war, there will actually be a decline of almost 5 per cent from 1950 to 1951 in the output of consumer goods and services. From 1950 to 1953, a period of mobilization for World War III according to our assumption, we have projected a modest increase of 10 per cent in total real output. If certain bottlenecks to increased production are removed and if war outlays prove to be larger than we have forecast, the increase in total output may be somewhat larger. None of it, however, would go to the consumption sector, so that the relative decline in production for consumer account compared with the increase in total output would be even greater than we have projected. If 1953 be considered representative of a typical year under the Permanent War Economy, with total war outlays taking almost 24 per cent of current production, the relative decline in consumption output compared with total output for the entire period since the advent of the Permanent War Economy is accurately measured by the 35 per cent increase in consumption output compared with the 58 per cent increase in total output. This is merely another way of saying that had the growth in consumption paralleled the rise in total output, which is the minimum performance to be expected from a satisfactory economic system once the basic productive forces are fairly well developed, there would have been a further increase of 17 per cent in the output of consumer goods and services.
 
PRODUCTION FIGURES BY THEMSELVES, although the basis of living standards, cannot accurately portray what has happened to individual standards of living for they ignore any changes that may have occurred in the size of the population. Since there has historically been a steady growth in the American population, for the average individual merely to be as well off as at the beginning of any period of years under analysis the growth in consumption output must at least equal the growth in population. In other words, we cannot intelligently talk about trends in average living standards unless we have first obtained a measure of per capita consumption output. This brings us to the third basic step in our analysis, which consists of deriving population figures representing the average total population for each year from 1939 to 1953 and applying them to the annual series for consumption output. The results, summarized in Table IV, provide per capita consumption output in both current and constant dollars and enable us to see what has happened from 1939 to 1953 in the average standard of living.

*From Table III.
†Based on Bureau of the Census data for continental United States, with an attempt made to
include all armed forces except that small portion considered to be permanently stationed
overseas. Data are as of July 1 or mid-year to represent average population for the year.
Projections for 1951–1953 assume maintenance of present rate of growth of about 200,000
per month.



The growth in the American population has been substantial, far in excess of most predictions, especially since the end of World War II. We calculate an average increase of 2,000,000 annually for the fourteen-year period from mid–1939 to mid–1953, or a total of about 28 million. Merely to support this increase in population in the style to which the average person is accustomed requires an annual increment on the average in the consumption sector of the economy of more than 1.5 per cent, or a total of more than 21 per cent from 1939 to 1953. Thus, by 1953, about two-thirds of the growth in consumption output will have been devoted to satisfying the wants of the net increase in population, assuming that there is no marked variation in the living standards of net additions to the population compared with old members of the population. The entire picture of what has happened to the average American standard of living under the Permanent War Economy is obviously altered to a significant extent by the introduction of the per capita concept in our analysis.
The American standard of living may be the highest in the world, but it is a complete delusion to claim any marked expansion in average living standards since the beginning of the Permanent War Economy in 1939, or for that matter since American capitalism entered the permanent world crisis of capitalism in 1929. So far as average standards of living are concerned, the vaunted economy of American capitalism has been virtually stagnant for more than two decades. In this fact is reflected all the ills and contradictions of American imperialism. Now, as the Permanent War Economy becomes more thoroughly entrenched, it is good-bye to the New Deal and to the Fair Deal and to all significant attempts to raise average living standards. Is any more dramatic confirmation required of the Marxian thesis that capitalism cannot be reformed into a rational and workable economic system?
Constant reference to the “growth in consumption,” as mirrored by the indisputable and very sizable increase in personal consumption expenditures or in our series on consumption output, on the completely acceptable theory that consumer outlay represents actual consumption, is of no avail in appraising trends in the average standard of living. There can be no growth in real consumption or living standards unless the increase in dollar expenditures by consumers and government for consumer goods and services exceeds the loss in the purchasing power of the dollar and the growth in the population. It may be-comforting to defenders of capitalism to be able to state that average per capita consumption has exceeded $1,300 since 1948, which is equivalent to almost $5,000 per family, but this is meaningless by itself. Only per capita consumption output in constant dollars, the index of which is shown in column six of Table IV, can be used to discover what has happened to average living standards.
 
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN has experienced a slight improvement in his standard of living since 1939, but the lag behind the increase in total production has been enormous. For the entire period from 1939 to 1953, our analysis indicates only an 11½ per cent betterment in the per capita average real standard of living, or less than one per cent a year. The various ups and downs within this over-all picture are most revealing. From 1939 to 1941, as idle resources were put to work under the stimulus of increasing war outlays, the average consumer experienced a 6 per cent rise in his standard of living. Then, in 1942&ndsh1943, as rapidly increasing war expenditures caused an actual curtailment in many lines of civilian production, the average standard of living reverted back to approximately the 1939 level. From 1944 to 1946, as war outlays reached their peak and then declined as the war ended, there was a rapid increase of almost 5 per cent a year in the average standard of living as the economy continued to operate at or near capacity levels. However, from 1946 to 1947 the average American suffered a 7 per cent decline in his standard of living as the increase in prices together with the decline in total output outstripped the reduction in war outlays. There then followed from 1947 to 1949 a rise of more than 11 per cent, bringing the average standard of living in 1949 to 19 per cent above the 1939 level, which was the highwater mark under the Permanent War Economy and will undoubtedly remain so. The slight decline in 1950 will be followed by a substantial decline of more than 6 per cent in 1951 as, once again, an actual curtailment in certain industries producing consumer goods and services will be experienced. A leveling off may then be expected at slightly above 1951 levels which may be expected to last until such time as there is a pronounced change in the ratio of war outlays to total output.
It is recognized that many other factors should be taken into consideration in evaluating trends in living standards, such as changes in the length of the working day and the working week, the intensity of labor, the impact of new methods of satisfying consumer wants, the disappearance of existing methods of satisfying consumer wants, especially in the field of consumer durables, and the changing character of distribution – to mention the most obvious. Nevertheless, the index of per capita average real standards of living is both conceptually sound and statistically accurate, at least sufficiently so as to permit confidence in the results. We must stress, however, that all we have succeeded in accomplishing at this point is to obtain a relatively precise view of what has happened and what may be expected to happen to the average American.
It goes without saying that we do not live in a classless society and that there is consequently a sharp differentiation in actual levels of living among the various classes and, equally important, in trends in class standards of living. This brings us to the fourth and final step in our analysis of declining standards of living under the Permanent War Economy. Without some indication of the differences among classes, no matter how tentative the figures must necessarily be, it is impossible to complete our analysis or to understand the most significant causal relationships affecting living standards under the Permanent War Economy.

The two indexes apparently correspond quite closely, being identical for 1941 and only three per cent apart in 1949. The Commerce Index, however, indicates a price rise of less than two per cent from 1949 to 1950, whereas our index shows an increase of more than four per cent during the same period.
 
Part II–B




Preliminary figures for 1951 indicate that 25 per cent of current production went to government in the form of taxes, as measured by the ratio of total government receipts (Federal plus state and local) minus total government receipts of social insurance contributions to net national product. This represents an all-time high, exceeding the peak World War II year of 1943 when the ratio was 24.5 per cent. The relationship of government income to current production and surplus value was shown in Table I of Part III (see May–June 1951 issue of The New International). For the estimated ratio of 22 per cent for 1950 presented there, we can now substitute the actual ratio of 24 per cent.
As was stated in Part III, “The increase in state functions, accompanied by a loss in the effectiveness of the capitalist market, has meant a colossal expansion in government expenditures, which, in turn, has necessitated a phenomenal increase in taxes.” With the state (all branches) consuming one-fourth of current output and two-fifths of surplus value, it is no wonder that all segments of the American population have become tax conscious.
Taxes, their amount, character and incidence, are a reflection of the class struggle. This is necessarily so in any class society. It is particularly true under American capitalism where practical politics is keenly alert to group and class pressures, both crude and subtle. In the epoch of the Permanent War Economy, when the ratio of total taxes to current production has increased from 16 per cent in 1939 to an estimated 25 per cent in 1951 – a rise in impact on all classes of better than 50 per cent – taxation becomes a central political and economic question of the highest magnitude.
Who pays the taxes becomes another way of asking who pays for war and war preparations and who bears the major burden of inflation? While the state is periodically forced to resort to borrowing, as shown in the previous article, in the long run the power of the state and the state bureaucracy is dependent on the portion of output that can be siphoned off in the form of taxes of various kinds.
It was not until 1941 that Federal tax receipts exceeded those of state and local governments. And it was only beginning in 1943 that the Federal personal income tax reached magnitudes sizable enough to penetrate the consciousness of the average individual. With the passage of the Revenue Act of 1951, we have now reached a situation where every class resents its tax burden. The, bourgeoisie complain that “taxes have destroyed individual initiative and are impairing the accumulation of capital.” The workers gripe and grumble that “they cannot make ends meet and that their take-home pay is inadequate to cope with the rising cost of living.” In between, the various layers of the middle classes and farming classes bewail “the pressure exerted on entrepreneurial income and professional salaries by rising costs of production, especially taxes.”
 
TOTAL TAX RECEIPTS have increased almost sixfold since 1939. With the major components of taxes accounting for 85-90 per cent of total tax receipts, the basic changes in the tax picture are shown in Table I.

*Excludes personal property taxes.



The data are from the 1951 National Income Supplement to the Survey of Current Business of the Department of Commerce. Aside from the major tax components shown, other sources of Federal tax revenue are estate and gift taxes, which rose from $61 million in 1929 to $371 million in 1939 and to a peak of $900 million in 1948, declining to $658 million in 1950; and customs duties, which have not changed materially over the years, yielding $599 million in 1929, $344 million in 1939, and $550 million in 1950. Other sources of state and local government tax revenue are corporate profits tax accruals, which were $145 million in 1929, $156 million in 1939, and rose to a peak of $895 million in 1950; and motor vehicle licenses other than those classified as personal taxes, which were $153 million in 1929, $182 million in 1939, and rose to a peak of $469 million in 1950. In addition, both Federal and state and local governments receive a variety of miscellaneous taxes and fees. Other than Federal grants-in-aid to state and local governments, these miscellaneous revenues do not have a significant effect on the tax structure so far as quantitative impact is concerned.
It will be seen that in 1929 Federal tax revenues were less than one-half the amount collected by state and local governments, with property taxes of $4.5 billion amounting to almost one-half of the total tax yield. In spite of the Great Depression and increasing state intervention under the New Deal, the tax picture remained fundamentally the same in 1939, the only significant change being the more than threefold increase in excise and sales taxes. With the advent of the Permanent War Economy, there occurred a sharp rise in virtually all existing forms of taxation, the most noteworthy increases being in the Federal personal income tax, corporation income and excess profits taxes, and excise and sales taxes. Despite the fact that property taxes rose from $4.3 billion in 1939 to $7.3 billion in 1950, their share of revenue raised by major tax sources declined from 40 per cent to 12 per cent.
Federal personal income taxes yielded less than $1 billion in 1939, but on a gross basis (prior to refunds) produced $15.9 billion in 1943 due to the drastic lowering of exemptions and the sharp rise in rates. Prior to 1943 the average worker was virtually unaffected by personal income taxes. After 1943, taxes become an important element in the cost of living, giving rise to the eminently reasonable demand by the trade unions that personal income taxes should be included in the BLS “cost-of-living” index. Naturally, the income tax yield fluctuates not only with respect to the effective tax rate, but also in relation to the size of the national income. From 1945 to 1950, the gross yield of the Federal personal income tax varied between a high of $20.4 billion in 1947 and a low of $17.7 billion in 1949. But during the same period, personal income rose from $172 billion to almost $225 billion – an increase of more than 30 per cent. The proportion of total tax receipts accounted for by the personal income tax – the one relatively progressive feature in the American tax structure – therefore declined steadily as both real output and total tax receipts increased.
Consequently, even though the Federal personal income tax yield is estimated to rise sharply in 1951 to about $25 billion, the progressive aspects of the American tax structure are still sharply outweighed by its regressive features. This conclusion is without reference to the specific nature of the income tax itself. It is based on the fact that corporation taxes, excise and sales taxes, and business property taxes are shifted entirely or almost entirely to the average consumer. Since these taxes account for the bulk of the total tax revenue, the concept that those who can afford to should pay the major part of the tax load is conspicuously absent in the American tax picture – despite the personal income tax.
 
THE ILLUSION THAT the bourgeoisie bears the real brunt of taxes is one of the biggest swindles ever perpetrated by capitalist propaganda. Capitalist apologists like to refer to the sharply rising rates on large individual incomes, which for the calendar year 1951 reach a maximum of 87.2 per cent of net income (possibly  affecting those with individual incomes in excess of one million dollars), but the incidence of taxation can only be seen when the entire tax burden by classes of income is analyzed. It is just as impermissible to confine one’s judgments on the American tax structure solely to the personal income tax as it is to draw conclusions on the average worker’s standard of living without reference to salary deductions, rising prices or the increase in total output.
All taxes and their impact must be considered, as well as the differences in income levels and proportionate shares in total output. Rather than go back to our own estimates, presented in Part II on Declining Standards of Living, we prefer to rely on official sources wherever possible.
First, it is necessary to establish that there has been no fundamental change in the distribution of personal income by income levels, despite the vast growth in total output and personal incomes. This can be done by a percentage analysis of money income going to each fifth of the population, as shown in Table II.

*Taken from Table 4 of Taxes and the Human Factor by Theodore J. Kreps, The

36), Department of Labor (1941), and 1950 Survey of Consumer Finances of the
Federal Reserve Board (1948).
† From the 1950 Census as reported by the Census Bureau in The New York Times
of December 2, 1951.



While much has been made of the slight improvement in the position of the middle income groups at the expense of the highest fifth, the changes are all well within the margin of error inherent in all such data. Moreover, there have been certain conceptual changes in this type of analysis over the years. In addition, comparisons between a depression year and a war economy year are apt to be misleading. Fundamentally, there has been no change. If the rich haven’t gotten richer as the poor have become poorer, the relative disparities in income levels have not changed. The rich remain rich while the poor remain poor – despite the tremendous increase in output, both in real and monetary terms. The richest twenty per cent of the population receives almost half the income, in 1948 averaging $9,911, while the poorest 20 per cent receives 3–4 per cent of the income, in 1948 averaging $893.
The distribution of personal income by income levels is before taxes and provides a necessary background for consideration of the impact of all taxes. If the tax burden falls chiefly on the upper fifth, then it would be possible to speak of a relatively progressive tax structure. This is especially so since those in the lower 60 per cent received a maximum income of less than $4,000 in 1948 – the minimum required to maintain any type of “decent” standard of living by any set of criteria. Or, if the upper income groups are bearing a noticeably heavier proportion of the total tax burden as total tax receipts increase, there would at least be evidence that the tax structure is becoming less regressive.
The facts are, however, that the American tax structure was and remains regressive to an amazing degree. The wealthy pay only a slightly higher percentage of their income in taxes than do other groups, and the poorest pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than the middle income groups. The reason, as has already been mentioned, is that the Federal personal income tax is overshadowed by other taxes whose burden is an inverse proportion to income. That this is indeed the situation and that it has not changed fundamentally under the Permanent War Economy, despite the enormous increase in taxes, can be seen from Tables III and IV.

* Taken from Table I of T.N.E.C. Monograph No. 3, Who Pays the Taxes?



Thus, just prior to the advent of the Permanent War Economy, taxes took about one-fifth of total personal income, with state and local government taxes accounting for more than one-half of the total tax yield. The completely regressive nature of state and local taxes, together with the semi-regressive nature of Federal taxes, produced a situation where the lowest income groups paid a higher proportion of their income in taxes than did all income groups under $10,000. It is only when the top income class of $20,000 and over (consisting of 0.3 per cent of spending units who received 9.1 per cent of total personal income) is considered that a feeble approach to a progressive tax system is apparent. And, obviously, a member of the bourgeoisie who in 1938–39 received $20,000 cheerfully paid about one-third of his income in taxes, while the average worker who received less than $1,500 could ill afford to pay about one-fifth of his income in taxes.
With personal income having tripled by 1948, the opportunity to recast the American tax structure in a progressive direction, despite the fivefold increase in total tax receipts, was present. Obviously, this could have been done without impoverishing the bourgeoisie who, as demonstrated in Part III, had accumulated sufficient surplus values to permit considerable easing of the tax burden of the lower income groups. Equally obviously, as can be seen from Table IV, this was not done.

*Taken from Table 5 of Kreps, op. cit., which, in turn, is based on The Distribution
of Tax Payments by Income Groups in 1948, by R.A. Musgrave, J.J. Carroll, L.D.
Cook, and L. Franc, published in The National Tax Journal, March 1951.



Thus, after a decade of the Permanent War Economy, taxes took about one-fourth of total personal income, with Federal taxes now accounting for more than three-fourths of the total tax yield. Nevertheless, the completely regressive nature of state and local taxes still combines with such regressive features of Federal taxes as excise taxes and corporation taxes to produce a situation where the lowest income group still pays a higher percentage of its income in taxes than all except the 5.3 per cent of the spending units in the $7,500 and over category. If there were a finer income breakdown in the higher income groups, the beginnings of a progressive tax structure would become apparent at a somewhat lower figure than in 1938–39, but there has been no fundamental change in the incidence of taxation nor in the character of the American tax structure.
The worker who received $1,000 in 1938–39 and paid approximately 18 per cent in total taxes may have had his income increased to $2,500 in 1948, with his tax payments rising to 21 per cent. His contribution to total government tax receipts would then have gone up from $180 to $525, leaving his net income after taxes at $1,957 against $820 – an increase in effective money income of 141 per cent. Meanwhile, the bourgeois whose income in 1938–39 was $10,000, on which he likewise paid 18 per cent in total taxes, may have had his income increased to $30,000 in 1948, with his tax payments rising to 40 per cent. The bourgeois’ contribution to total government tax receipts would then have increased from $1,800 to $12,000, leaving his net income after taxes at $18,000 against $8,200 – an increase in effective money income of only 120 per cent. On the surface, therefore, the worker is better off and capitalist inequality has tended to be reduced as a result of rising taxes.
Such growing “equality” the bourgeoisie can well afford, for if our hypothetical worker and bourgeois are assumed to represent their respective classes, what has happened is that total effective money income of both classes has risen from $9,020 to $19,975 – an increase of $10,955, of which $9,800, or 89.5 per cent, has gone to the bourgeoisie. The bourgeois is now only nine times better off than the worker, whereas previously his effective money income was ten times greater, but again nothing fundamental has changed in the relative positions of the basic classes of modern capitalist society. The state, however, whose function is more and more to protect the rule and the wealth of the bourgeoisie, is being financed in steadily increasing measure by the workers and lower middle classes. Therein lies the secret of the role of taxation under the Permanent War Economy, while equality of incomes remains just as much a mirage on the horizon as it ever was.
The data in Table IV can be used to derive the relative class burdens of taxation, if certain arbitrary assumptions be made to relate income brackets to classes. The results are necessarily rough, but demonstrate conclusively that the bourgeoisie by no means bear the major share of financing their state. If we assume that those in the $7,500 and over group, comprising 5.3 per cent of the number of spending units, represent the bourgeoisie and their main supporters among the upper middle classes, we can calculate their class tax burden, since Kreps notes that the effective tax rates are computed on an estimated personal income in 1948 of $211.9 billion, which is close enough to the reported figure of $209.5 billion. With this upper income group receiving 28.8 per cent of personal income, it is apparent that they received $61 billion, on which they paid an over-all tax rate of 31.7 per cent, or a total tax bill of $19.3 billion. This is equivalent to slightly more than one-third of total tax payments. In other words, the working classes and lower middle classes contribute almost two-thirds of total tax payments.
 
THE KREPS PAMPHLET, previously cited, constitutes one of the most effective indictments yet published on the inequities of the present American tax structure. In addition, it effectively refutes the arguments advanced by the apologists of the bourgeoisie that the masses must necessarily bear the major burden of tax increases. Kreps states and proves that “the principal beneficiaries of inflation were (in terms of actual dollars and cents) not the lower-income-bracket wage-and-pension-receiving masses but the upper-bracket-income entrepreneurs and owners of properties and equities.” Readers of earlier articles in this series are thoroughly familiar with the facts of income distribution, which thoroughly debunk the carefully cultivated notion that the working masses have been the beneficiary of inflation.
Another assiduously propagandized falsehood is that the low-income masses are under-taxed and should therefore bear the major burden of new taxes. The factual refutation of this argument has already been presented, but there is another side to this coin which is most interesting. Not only do the upper income groups pay a smaller proportion of taxes than they claim or than they should by any standard of justice or equity, but they pay much less than they legally and morally should. The tax laws are drafted and administered by the representatives of capital in the interests of the ruling class. As Kreps puts it, “... opportunities for tax avoidance and tax evasion are much larger in the high-income brackets than in those below $3,000.”
The gap between Treasury reports of adjusted gross personal income, based on income tax returns, and Commerce estimates of personal income is extremely large. In 1948, for example, the Commerce figure was $45 billion higher than the Treasury total. Today, it must run well over $60 billion. Only a portion of this income that somehow miraculously evaporated when income tax returns were filled out can be attributed to non-monetary aspects of personal income included by Commerce, or to legal tax avoidance by low-income groups such as the exemption of military pay below $1,500 and the right to postpone reporting of accrued interest on E-bonds.
“Tax avoidance, completely legal but nonetheless real,” states Kreps, “favors those in the upper income groups; for example, those who own their own homes. In the $7,500 and over bracket two out of three own their own homes whereas in the brackets between $1,000 and $3,000 the figure is about half that percentage. Now homeowners are not required to report the constructive income which they receive from their investment in their home (which may keep them out of a higher tax bracket). In addition, they can actually deduct local taxes on their home, and interest on the mortgage if there be one, which deduction cuts down their Federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate applicable to their income. Renters (of whom there are proportionately more than twice as many in the lower income brackets) simply pay out rent each month from an income total on which they pay taxes in full.
“Moreover, the splitting of incomes of married persons, which means nothing on lower bracket incomes (below $4,000), involves progressively more and more dollars of tax savings to each couple in the upper brackets, another reason why the per cent of income taken by taxes in the upper income brackets is not as high as one might expect.
“Those receiving entrepreneurial incomes are given several additional loopholes ... Those owning oil properties can take 27.5 per cent depletion allowances year after year. Capital gains are taxed only 25 per cent [now 26 per cent – T.N.V.] after but a six months’ waiting period. Businessmen can split the income from their business several ways simply by making their wives, infant children and relatives ‘partners’ – though they may be called upon to prove that they did not do so simply for tax avoidance purposes. Executives can receive compensation in the form of stock options subject only to the rate on capital gains rather than the full income tax rates. And so on.”
In other words, there are very few opportunities for legal tax avoidance in the lower income brackets. The worker’s tax is withheld at the source and unless he has incurred unusually heavy medical expenses or some similar permitted deduction he pays 100 per cent of his income tax obligation. The worker cannot carry back or forward his “losses” that may have arisen due to unemployment, but the owner of capital can. The worker cannot deduct “business expenses”  which the average businessman does to the full limit of what he can get away with. In fact, deduction of business expenses for entertainment, travel, etc., has reached such scandalous proportions that virtually every businessman has established charge accounts with restaurants, night clubs, etc., to “prove” that he spent the sums deducted as business expenses. That he also feeds and entertains himself while actually or theoretically promoting business is apparently outside the administration of the tax law. There can be little doubt that the amount of tax avoidance that occurs through the one device of “business expenses” amounts to billions of dollars.
The upper income individual can pose as a public-spirited person, and incidentally on occasion promote his own business interests, by making his 15 per cent contribution to charity. The lower income person simply does not have the means, nor does he as a rule possess the economic, social or political motives for such contributions. Related to this eminently respectable tax-dodging device is the legal evasion granted to the creators of trust funds, which not only avoids current income taxes but permits fortunes to be passed on to heirs with a notoriously minimum amount paid in estate taxes. The adroit use of gifts and gift taxes, it should be noted, is an integral part of this type of tax avoidance. The low amount of gift and estate taxes, observed earlier, and their decline since 1948 would undoubtedly prove to be a more profitable source of Congressional inquiry, in terms of added income to the government, than even the corruption in the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
There are many other legal loopholes. The excess profits tax, in particular, is so full of loopholes that it is practically a joke. So overt is the loophole situation that when President Truman signed the Revenue Act of 1951 on October 20th, he was constrained to say:
“Furthermore, this legislation does little to close the loopholes in present tax laws, and in some respects provides additional means by which wealthy individuals can escape paying their proper share of the national tax load through such devices as excessively liberal ‘capital gains’ provisions, family partnerships and excessive depletion allowances on oil and gas and certain mineral properties.”
It should be obvious that the function of legal loopholes is not primarily to provide additional business for accountants and tax lawyers. Legal avoidance of taxes is part of the system by which the ruling class perpetuates its wealth and power. The tax laws are admittedly rigged in the interests of business. Elimination merely of obvious legal loopholes would by itself raise sufficient revenue to have made unnecessary the increases in the income tax under the Revenue Acts of 1950 and 1951. It must be emphasized that legal tax avoidance amounts to billions upon billions of dollars and that the bourgeoisie is virtually the sole beneficiary of such largesse. Not the lower income groups but the upper income groups are under-taxed!
In addition to tax avoidance, there is tax evasion, which is presumably illegal. States Kreps:
“Opportunities for tax evasion are similarly much more abundant in the upper income brackets than in the lower. Evasion is next to impossible where employers or fiduciaries make reports and act as collecting agencies in withholding taxes at the source, i.e., for wage earners, pensioners, public employees, etc. These have no chance to under-report their income [but the New York World-Telegram and Sun of December 10, 1951, reports that the government had warrants out on October 31st for more than $96 million owed by employers as tax delinquency on workers’ payroll deductions – T.N.V.]. But note [in Table V] the types of income on which under-reporting occurred in 1946.”

If the data in Table V are indicative of what normally transpires, 14 per cent of income tax net income is evaded by failure to report the legally correct amount. Which income levels are guilty of such evasions? Obviously, the upper income groups, for only 71 per cent of entrepreneurial income, 37 per cent of interest payments, 76 per cent of actual dividends paid, and 45 per cent of rents received, appeared on income tax returns. Income from these sources goes overwhelmingly to the upper income groups. Even in the case of wages and salaries, where there is a five per cent under-reporting, amounting in 1946 to $5 billion, or 25 per cent, of the total of $20 billion unreported, much, if not most, of the under-reporting would undoubtedly be traceable to the upper income groups.
At present income levels, assuming that the same degree of under-reporting holds true, the difference between “actual” and “reported” money income would exceed $30 billion rather than the $20 billion shown for 1946. On the basis of 1951 income tax rates, especially in view of the fact that tax evasion is concentrated in the upper income groups, elimination of tax evasion due to under-reporting of incomes would add well over $5 billion in tax revenue to the Federal government. This is without reference to cases of fraud where there is a deliberate failure to report income that arose illegally and was not entered on books of account but usually remitted in cash transactions. Nor has any attempt been made to assess the amount of income tax evasion due to the keeping of deliberately fictitious books. Likewise, the data on under-reporting of incomes have nothing to do with the amount outstanding in delinquent taxes, which the Bureau of Internal Revenue admits totals over $632 million (New York Times, December 11, 1951).
Whether income tax evasion due to bribery of tax officials would add significantly to the amount of revenue the government should be collecting, we do not know. Perhaps the present Congressional investigation will throw some quantitative light on the picture. One thing is certain, however, and that is that it is not the low-income groups that bribe and corrupt government officials. The best proof that under-reporting and evasion of taxes among the upper income group are costing the government billions of dollars annually in lost tax revenues is to be found in the reported decision of Secretary of the Treasury Snyder to require the individual auditing of each taxpayer’s return in the $25,000 and over bracket rather than the sampling technique used for the mass of income tax returns.
 
DECEPTION IN TAX MATTERS now extends to the government’s official press releases. All official Washington releases on the Revenue Act of 1951 stated, in effect, that: “The bill increases the tax on most individual incomes by 11.75 per cent.” Whereupon, the average citizen concluded that, if his income remained the same, he would pay only 11.75 per cent more in Federal income tax in 1951 than he did in 1950. He was also led to believe that his 1952 tax would, barring a further increase in tax rates, be about the same as in 1951. This particular fraud was exposed in an article in the New York World-Telegram and Sun of November 20, 1951, based on an analysis supplied by Fred S. Peabody, for 20 years a special agent in the Income Tax Bureau and now an accountant and tax expert. A selection of cases to portray the actual impact of the Revenue Act of 1951 on individual income taxes is shown in Table VI.

“You’ll notice,” states the article, “that some really do pay only about 11 per cent. The fellow who has to struggle with a net $50,000 income gets off with that.
“‘But simple arithmetic,’ said Mr. Peabody, ‘shows that for 1951 the increase over 1950 is much greater than the 11.75 per cent announced in Washington. Most persons will pay between 16.75 and 18 per cent.’
“What Mr. Peabody emphasizes is that the percentage increase cited on passage of the new tax bill last October was ‘apparently based on the increase in tax to be withheld from wages beginning Nov. 1, instead of on the increase in tax you will pay for the full 1951 year.’
“The gimmick was the sizable credit which everybody was allowed on the tax paid last spring on part of his 1950 income ...
“‘The Revenue Act of 1951,’ Mr. Peabody explained, ‘eliminated the 13 per cent credit allowed on the first $400 of tax granted under the 1950 law. So it is obvious that the percentage increase over the 1950 rate is at least 13 per cent of the first $400 of tax.
“‘It is believed that the loss of this 13 per cent cut affects a large majority of taxpayers. The rest lost a reduction of 9 per cent under last year’s law.
“‘As the increased rates ... did not become effective until Nov. 1 their full effect won’t be felt until next year. Then most persons will pay between 27.25 and 28.25 per cent more than they would have paid on the same income at 1950 rates.’”
Thus, the real impact of the new tax increase is on the workers and lower middle classes and won’t be felt until March 15. At that time, those who have regularly been receiving sizable refunds because too much has been withheld will find that they get little or no refund, while others will find that they have to pay substantial additional sums to the government. The impact on March 15, 1953 on 1952 incomes will be even greater, as indicated, without any further increase in the income tax.
There is no need to cite the increases in excise taxes on liquor, cigarettes, gasoline, etc., or other regressive features of the Revenue Act of 1951. The facts are there for all who wish to take an unbiased look at them. It is frequently argued, however, that regardless of justice, etc., it is necessary to increase taxes more heavily on the lower income groups because that is the only way to reduce consumption of consumer commodities that are draining materials away from war output, and that inflation cannot be prevented without mopping up the “excess income” of the low-income masses. Both arguments are basically false, as Kreps demonstrates.
 
“THE THIRD FALLACY requiring exposure to facts,” observes Kreps, “is the notion that 60 per cent of the people must do 60 per cent of the consumption.” As exposure of this tendentious argument in favor of increasing taxes on the lower income groups, in order to restrict consumption and thereby save critically needed materials, he offers the evidence contained in Table VII, submitted by Professor Musgrave in testimony before the Joint Committee on the Economic Report.

Comments Kreps:
“Those getting less than $3,000 (representing 54 per cent of the spending units) buy only 26 per cent of the durable goods, only 27 per cent of the liquor, 28.8 per cent of all goods at retail excepting food, and make only 31.3 per cent of all consumer expenditures.
“On the other hand, those getting over $4,000, comprising only 27 per cent of the spending units, buy 54 per cent of all durable goods, 50.5 per cent of the liquor, 51.2 per cent of all goods sold at retail excluding food, and account for 48 per cent of all consumer expenditures. It is the spending of those getting over $4,000 that must be curbed if a major frontal attack is to be made on the problems of restricting consumption.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The apologists for the bourgeoisie also like to argue that it is the low-income masses who are responsible for the inflationary pressure generated by excess demand. The masses, they claim, hold the bulk of savings. This “hot” money, they assert, will be used to push up prices unless the tax collector relieves the mass of the population of “huge” savings. Nothing could be further from the truth. The overwhelming portion of personal savings has always been concentrated in the hands of the upper five or ten per cent of the population.
Writes Kreps:
“Actually, the amount of United States Government bonds and savings and checking accounts held by the majority, that is, the 26,000,000 consumer units getting less than  12,700, is only 27.1 per cent of the total. In so far as there is a ‘hot money’ problem with respect to E-bonds in 1950 or 1951, it is for the most part a middle and upper-income bracket problem. They are the only groups that have any substantial quantities of E-bonds or other liquid assets left. The lower income groups have for the most part sold theirs.
“In 1949 more than half the population failed to save a dime. In fact, on balance, their dissaving has continually increased though, of course, there still remain a minority even in the lowest income brackets that manage to save despite the fact that the majority do not. On the other hand, the savings of the top tenth have increased so much that in 1949 their net savings exceeded the total of all net savings in the country. In other words, on balance, the lowest 90 per cent in the income scale saved nothing.”
Moreover, adds Kreps,
“... since V-J Day, about twelve-and-a-half million spending units have parted with all the savings bonds they owned ... In short, ‘hot money’ in large amounts is primarily not a mass-income bracket, but an upper-income bracket phenomenon.”
The workers and lower middle classes, thus, were not responsible for the orgy of consumer buying following the outbreak of the Korean war. On the contrary, it was the bourgeoisie and upper middle classes, the only ones with the income, savings or credit to permit widespread advance buying and hoarding, particularly of durable goods, who built up private inventories in precisely the same manner as businessmen accumulated huge inventories. While inflation is inherent and permanent under the Permanent War Economy, as we have previously demonstrated, the engine of inflation is always and necessarily the accumulation and expenditure of surplus values on the part of the bourgeoisie.
We need not be particularly concerned with Kreps’ conclusions, for his position is the traditional one of the liberals and intellectuals. As such, it will receive brief comment below. His case against heavier taxes on mass incomes, however, is most cogently made. It is well to have the data before us when evaluating the position of the various classes with respect to taxation.
“... any new tax falling on those getting less than $3,000 will cut production much more than it will cut or divert consumption.” In support of this contention, which is based on the fact that “tens of millions of families have had their budgets so cruelly cut by inflation that minimum standards of health and productivity are being eroded away,” Kreps offers the following income analysis, which we present below as Table VIII.

‡Statistics of Income 1948, Part I (Preliminary).
†Estimated on the basis of number of families by size groups within each income class multiplied by an
estimated minimum income figure needed to sustain a family of a specified size – i.e., $1,000 for each
individual living alone; $1,500 for two person families; $2,000 for three, $2,500 for four, $3,000 for five,
$3,500 for six, and $4,000 for families of seven or more persons.



“To be sure,” states Kreps, “economic literature abounds in controversies concerning the ‘efficiency level’ of consumption or the level of ‘minimum needs.’ Thus, for example, the minimum health and decency budget currently published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics is one so high that even at current high levels of national income, nearly three-fourths of the population fail to attain it.
“Yet in quantitative terms even that budget hardly seems luxurious or excessive. It provides, for example, that a man can buy a top coat only once in ten years, that his wife can have only one new cotton street dress a year; that her wool dress has to last five years. The family can buy a low-priced car only once every 15 or 16 years. Other durable goods such as cook stoves, refrigerators, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, sewing machines, have to last 17 years or longer. In quantitative terms, such a budget level seems a considerable distance removed from luxury consumption, yet at 1950 prices the income estimated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as necessary to finance this standard of living is $1,630 for a single person, and $2,330 for a married couple.
“In order to be highly conservative, the figures in Table VIII have been computed on a basis more than one-third lower than the BLS figures ... Even on this basis, as the table clearly indicates, the tens of millions of families and single individuals who receive less than $2,000 a year come short by many billions of dollars in obtaining the income necessary for efficiency consumption and productivity. As a defense measure, incomes not higher than efficiency levels ought to be kept inviolate and not further lowered by general sales taxes or general manufacturers’ excise taxes.
“Table VIII likewise indicates where the money in excess of such, a minimum may be found. Of the total of roughly $44.5 billion in 1948 that may have been available in excess of minimum need, $17.2 billion, or 40 per cent was in the hands of persons with incomes of $10,000 or over; another 22 per cent in the hands of persons receiving over $6,000 but less than $10,000; more than 23 per cent in the hands of persons receiving over $4,500 but less than $6,000; and less than 8 per cent in the brackets below $3,000.”
 
Part VI–B




With the beginning of World War II, both American and world capitalism entered a new epoch – the era of the Permanent War Economy. This was not easily discernible in the immediate postwar period and it is only now, after the outbreak of the Korean war, that there is growing awareness that cap italism has entered a new stage. Its political basis of “neither peace nor war” was demonstrated in After Korea – What? in the previous issue of The New International. Whether American armed forces are continuously engaged in active combat is immaterial to the nature of the new period in which we live. That is merely a tactical aspect in the current struggle for world supremacy between American and Stalinist imperialisms. In fact, the character of the Permanent War Economy, because it operates in either “peace” or “war,” is most clearly delineated precisely when American armed forces are not engaged in open hostilities.
In the same article, by analyzing the gigantic growth in output during the war and the maintenance of this high level of production since the war, together with the huge accumulation of capital, we have really provided the key data underlying the economic basis of the Permanent War Economy. Its essential features can be seen by examining the entire period since 1939, remembering that never before in the history of the United States have expenditures for war or “national defense” purposes in peacetime exceeded one or one and one-half per cent of total output. In other words, prior to the advent of the Permanent War Economy the end-purpose of economic activity, other than in wartime, was to satisfy consumers’ wants through the production and distribution of commodities that yielded a profit or other form of surplus value to the capitalist. War outlays were so negligible in peacetime that they could be ignored in any analysis of the economy for they had no real measurable impact.
During the century and more of the development of modern capitalism, since the first industrial crisis of 1825, the capitalist sought his profit in the marketplace through the production of consumer goods and services. Some capitalists, of course, made a profit through the production of means of production (fixed capital) but such machinery was intended for the use of other capitalists who, in turn, would employ the machines to produce consumer commodities more profitably than could otherwise be done. This was the typical modus operandi of capitalism up to and into the period of its decline, except in wartime, until the beginning of the Permanent War Economy. It governed all phases of the business cycle.
To be sure, relatively small standing armies and navies were accepted. Even in European countries that practised conscription, however, these armed forces were distinguished by their smallness. With only a handful of exceptions, the bourgeoisie did not look to government war orders or “defense contracts” as an important source of business or profit. When a war came, it was universally regarded as an interruption of normal activity, even if it yielded imperialist profits and markets. When a war ended, it was the bourgeoisie who took the lead in resuming production of peacetime commodities and who, for the most part, resented any governmental attempt to maintain a larger armed force than had previously existed in peacetime. While war was normal in the sense that it occurred every so often, and was an acceptable instrument of national policy, it was abnormal in that large expenditures for war purposes in peacetime were not socially acceptable and that morally war and war outlays were to be avoided if at all possible.
 
THE DOMINANT CHARACTERISTIC of the Permanent War Economy is that war output becomes a legitimate end-purpose of economic activity. This development and its basic significance were analyzed by Walter J. Oakes in an article in the February 1944 issue of Politics, entitled Toward a Permanent War Economy? Oakes’ definition remains perfectly valid to this day:
“A war economy ... is not determined by the expenditure of a given percentage of a nation’s resources and productive energies for military purposes. This determines only the kind of war economy – good, bad, or indifferent from the point of view of efficiency in war-making. The question of amount, however, is obviously relevant. At all times, there are some expenditures for war or ‘national defense.’ How much must the government spend for such purposes before we can say a war economy exists? In general terms, the problem can be answered as follows: a war economy exists whenever the government’s expenditures for war (or ‘national defense’) become a legitimate and significant end-purpose of economic activity. The degree of war expenditures required before such activities become significant obviously varies with the size and composition of the national income and the stock of accumulated capital. Nevertheless, the problem is capable of theoretical analysis and statistical measurement.” (Italics in original.)
We shall return to Oakes, both his contributions and his mistakes. We now have, however, a large body of factual data from 1939 to 1950. We can also project our data through 1953 with a fair amount of accuracy on the basis of what is currently known regarding Washington’s plans. Only one major assumption is required; namely, that large-scale global hostilities involving the armed forces of the United States will not take place before 1954. We shall then have a period of fifteen years to analyze. With the rapid movement of history in the twentieth century this is sufficient to isolate the major features of the Permanent War Economy, to discover its basic laws of motion and to propose what now appear to be proper strategy and tactics for the independent socialist movement.
It is clear that we must begin with the relationship between war outlays and total output. As a first step, we can take the government’s official figures for “national defense and related activities” as a percentage of gross national product, net national product and national income. These data for 1939–1953 are shown in Table A.

*Data for 1950–1953 are estimated, as explained in the text; 1950 national income and
product data are based on Department of Commerce figures for the first half of the year,
with 1950 war outlays based on expenditures for “national defense and related activities”
as reported by the Treasury Department for the first eight months of the year.



The use of either gross national product, net national product, or national income as a measure of total output does not alter the basic relationships or trends involved. The definition of war outlays, and therefore the choice of series selected, is, however, of some significance. Inasmuch as it is desirable to use official government figures wherever possible, without distorting the picture that emerges, we have selected the series called “national defense and related activities” as our measure of direct war outlays. We could have used the Federal war component of gross national product, as estimated by the National Income Division of the Department of Commerce. Aside from the fact that Commerce has not published the breakdown between Federal war and non war purchases since 1946, this latter series, although based on Treasury classifications of expenditures, runs at a somewhat lower level than the former, apparently being more closely confined to the heart of war expenditures as represented by the Department of Defense.
Under the Commerce concept, for example, the peak of war outlays in 1944 is $88,615,000,000 against the $90,888,000,000 shown in the table. While this is a difference of more than $2 billion, the percentage of resources devoted to direct war output at the peak of the war effort is only reduced from 42.5 per cent to 41.5 per cent of gross national product or, in the case of net national product, from 45 per cent to 43.9 per cent. A shift of one or two percentage points in the ratio of war output to total production is of little consequence to our analysis and well within the margin of error in all the estimates. Both series, moreover, possess almost identical trend lines except for the year 1941 where, inexplicably, the Commerce series is one billion dollars higher than the Treasury series. This discrepancy may be due to arithmetical error or, more probably, to different procedures in allocating war expenditures by years.
At any rate, as explained in the 1949 statistical supplement to the Survey of Current Business, “expenditures for ‘national defense and related activities’ currently include those of the Departments of the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy; payments under Armed Forces Leave Act; expenditures of the US Maritime Commission, UNRRA, surplus property disposal agencies, and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (after July 1, 1947, expenditures of RFC for national defense and related activities were not segregated from other expenditures of the Corporation and its affiliates, which are included under ‘other’ expenditures).” Conceptually, this appears to represent a fairly good measure of direct war outlays and is, in any case, the best available. It permits a relatively accurate analysis of the impact of direct war outlays on the economy.
 
WAR OUTLAYS, AS THUS DEFINED, were projected for the last four months of 1950 and for 1951–1953 on a fairly crude basis, in the absence of any detailed public information on military requirements and related programs. The method used was to assume an armed forces manpower trend from the latest published figures, including such information as is available on the draft, and the announced goal of reaching an armed force of three million by mid–1951. A “salary” ratio for average military personnel was then developed on the basis of published data for military wages and salaries, which assumes only a very modest increase from 1949 to 1953 in the cost of maintaining average military personnel. While this factor is subject to some margin of error, it is necessarily small. A more serious difficulty was encountered in the second step of the projection, which was to develop an “equipment” ratio to relate total expenditures of the Department of Defense to total military wage and salary payments. Here the assumption of increasing fire power and mechanization, although based on past experience, is essentially arbitrary. To compensate for any possible overstatement inherent in the method, or for any lag in military procurement, the projection excludes any attempt to forecast the trend in the “related activities” portion of our war outlays series. Expenditures for direct war outlays of $40.1 billion in 1951, $46.9 billion in 1952 and $54.3 billion, in 1953 were obtained, as can be seen from column (4) in the table on Relationship of War Outlays to Total Output. These results conform rather closely to the guarded public statements of leading officials in the Department of Defense. If anything, our figures appear to be on the conservative side. [1]
The projections of the total output measures, gross national product, net national product and national income, were based on fairly straightforward extrapolations of existing trends. Allowance was made for increasing indirect business tax liabilities, thus accounting for the somewhat smaller rate of increase in national income as compared with national product, both gross and net. With the exception of 1951, when it is assumed that many defense plants idle since the end of the war will be reactivated, constant rates of capital consumption have been assumed. Virtually identical trends in both gross and net national product thus result. It should be kept in mind that the method employed makes rather full allowance for rising prices in 1950, but only partially anticipates the inflation that is bound to occur in 1951 and makes virtually no allowance for rising prices in 1952 and 1953. This, however, is entirely consistent with the method used to project war outlays, which likewise largely ignored the effects of inflation on military salaries and procurement, thereby permitting fairly accurate measurement of the relationships involved.
It is recognized that more accurate results would be obtained if the relationship between war outlays and total output were expressed in constant rather than in current dollars, for it may be safely assumed that price rises in the war sector during a major war outstrip price rises in the civilian sector. It should be emphasized, however, that this would be noticeable in columns (5), (6) and (7) only for the years 1942–1945. Inasmuch as the difference would not be significant (at the peak of the war effort in 1943–1944, war outlays would still take at least 40 per cent of gross national product in real terms as compared with 42.8 per cent or 42.5 per cent) and the statistical measure could only be the crudest sort of approximation, we accordingly sacrifice theoretical to practical considerations and make no attempt to express our data in constant dollars.
In view of the fact that war outlays are gross (that is, they make no allowance for the consumption of capital in the war sector), it may be wondered why the relationship between war outlays and total output is not confined exclusively to gross national product. In theory, this would indubitably be a sounder procedure. In practice, however, this would tend to understate the impact of war and the Permanent War Economy, for the definition of war outlays is relatively narrow and restricted. It is confined exclusively to the Federal government, and hardly covers all direct war-induced outlays in this sphere. It omits all private expenditures that may directly or indirectly result from war or war preparations.
If, for example, we posit an economy in which war and war preparations are non-existent, think of all the expenditures in the private sector that would be abandoned, thereby freeing these resources for the satisfaction of consumer wants. Included would be such matters as all private expenditures for civil defense, an unknown percentage of the output of the chemical, aviation and other industries that is not financed by the government, an unknown percentage of various aspects of privately-financed research, and without question a significant portion of the outlay for all forms of transportation. Moreover, the consumption of capital in the war sector is relatively small compared with the civilian sector. In view of all these considerations, not to mention certain conceptual and statistical limitations in the measurement of gross national product, we are of the opinion that the relationship between war outlays and net national product, as shown in column (6), is the best single measure available of the impact of direct war preparations and production and that the range of probable error in the estimates is adequately shown by columns (5) and (7).
 
WHILE TOTAL REAL OUTPUT ROSE steadily during the war, with relatively minor fluctuations since the end of the war, it will now be further increased until by 1953 production will approximate the peak achieved during the last war. Meanwhile, war outlays rose much faster than total output during World War II, thereby reflecting both the increase in total output and the shift of resources from civilian to war production. In percentage terms, the 1.6 per cent of total output devoted to war outlays in 1939 represents, insignificant as it may be, an extremely high level for a peacetime year before the development of the Permanent War Economy. The economy of the United States was for the last time to lag behind the rest of the capitalist world in conforming to the requirements of the Permanent War Economy. By 1940, with three per cent of production devoted to war purposes, American imperialism began in rather hesitating fashion, while war was engulfing the world, to develop its own war economy. With war outlays taking about 11 per cent of total output in 1941, the percentage then rose more than fourfold to about 45 per cent in 1943–1944 as American imperialism crushed the challenge of German and Japanese imperialisms, aided of course by the Allies.
There then occurred a sharp decline, until Korea, in the ratio of war outlays to total output. It is most significant, however, that the decrease in war outlays or in the ratio between war outlays and total output did not approach the low levels of 1939 or even of 1940. Here is the first real evidence of the change ushered in by the Permanent War Economy. Even at their low point in 1948, direct war outlays of more than $11 billion, representing almost 5 per cent of total output, are hardly insignificant. They will now rise sharply, although not as rapidly as during World War II. Nevertheless, there will immediately be a threefold rise in direct war outlays and, by 1952–1953, a threefold increase in the ratio of war outlays to total output.
We are, so to speak, in a situation comparable to 1941. This does not mean that 1942 has to follow immediately. On the contrary, as already explained, there is every reason to believe that all-out shooting war will not take place for several years. It does mean, however, that war expenditures have indeed become both a legitimate and significant end-purpose of economic activity. As a consequence, economic theory (both bourgeois and Marxist) will have to be modified in several important respects. Consider, for example, the following statement of Simon Kuznets, the outstanding pioneer in the field of national income in the United States, in his book, National Product in Wartime, published in 1945:
“In conclusion, we stress the dependence of the concept and the estimates upon the definition of the purpose of economic activity. National product cannot be measured for the years of a major war as it is in peacetime because the customary long-run assumptions concerning the goals of economic activity are not basic.”
It is precisely the goals of economic activity that the Permanent War Economy has changed. Sizable outlays for “defense”  are now normal and socially acceptable. It may even be suspected that these war outlays play an important role in sustaining a generally high level of economic activity. This appears to be clear when the ratio of war outlays to. total output exceeds 10 per cent but what about the period from 1947–1950 when the percentage hovered around five and six per cent? Direct war outlays may have been below the “critical” point in these years, but the picture is considerably altered when indirect war outlays are included in our analysis.
 
ASIDE FROM THE EXPENDITURES of the Department of Defense and the relatively minor additional outlays included in the series on “national defense and related activities,” our measure of direct war outlays, there are a whole host of programs in which the Federal government is engaged that stem directly or indirectly from previous wars or are an integral part of American imperialism’s preparations for World War III. These fall into two broad categories: foreign economic and military aid, whose essential purpose is to obtain allies and markets for American imperialism; and certain domestic programs, such as all the expenditures of the Veterans Administration, that are imposed on the national state as the only feasible method of carrying them out. While some of these expenditures, although from different motives and with different results, would have to be incurred by a workers’ state, they are clearly a product of the Permanent War Economy. Failure to include them in our analysis would distort the entire nature and impact of the new stage in the history of capitalism.
Indirect war outlays are really a new phenomenon in the sense that they first become sizable in the post-World War II period, as can be seen from Table B, which also permits a comparison of the relative importance of direct and indirect war outlays and an analysis of their combined impact on total output.

* Taken from Table A.



Our estimates of indirect war outlays have been built up by analyzing in detail each program that it appeared proper to include in our classification and by projecting those programs that appear reasonably certain to continue on as conservative and realistic a basis as possible. If anything, our figures understate the true magnitude of indirect war outlays. In keeping with our entire approach, only government programs have been considered. The exclusion of all indirect private war outlays leaves out such febrile activities as building of atomic bomb shelters and preservation of records in bomb-proof vaults, to mention only the obvious. Then, we have made only token allowance for state ant! local government expenditures for civil defense and related matters. Moreover, we have failed to identify all the Federal programs that should be included under the classification, “indirect war outlays.” For example, no attempt has been made to include RFC loans for “defense” purposes, which have been excluded since July 1, 1947 from direct war outlays. In addition, propaganda activities of the Federal government, such as the Voice of America, are excluded from our figures, but are clearly part and parcel of war preparations, at least in large measure.
Our projections of the major programs comprising indirect war outlays have assumed that the Republican gains in Congress will be reflected in a more careful scrutiny of all such expenditures, although no fundamental change in policy is anticipated. Dollar-wise, the most important program is represented by the Veterans Administration, which reached a peak of $7.l billion in 1947 and remained at $6.8 billion during 1948 and 1949. Although current expenditures of the Veterans Administration are running at the rate of $6 billion annually, we have reduced this item to $5 billion in 1951 and only subsequently do we project a modest increase in view of the expanding size of the armed forces.
With regard to the so-called Mutual Defense Assistance Program, which covers all forms of military aid to Atlantic Pact nations, Greece, Turkey, etc., it is difficult to see how this can be less than the $5 billion projected in 1952 and 1953. If any serious attempt is made to contain Stalinist imperialism in Asia, this type of expenditure may be expected to increase markedly above present insignificant levels. Despite the Gray report, our projections for the Marshall Plan, Point Four and Export-Import bank loans have been extremely modest. They total $2.7 billion in 1951, $2 billion in 1952 and only $1.5 billion in 1953. In the case of the Point Four program, for which the Gray report recommends an annual expenditure of 500 million dollars, our peak projection reaches only $200 million. All remaining foreign aid programs are inconsequential in magnitude. Our analysis remains unaffected even if they were to be completely eliminated, but such cannot be the case since they include Korean aid and other programs that will be operated mainly through the United Nations. Because a portion of the data was obtained on a fiscal year basis, there may be certain adjustments required in the allocations by calendar year, but these are unlikely to be serious. The only place where there is any possible overstatement of indirect war outlays is in our assignment of total expenditures by the Atomic Energy Commission to this category. There is no basis, however, for allocating any portion of such activities to civilian output and the safest procedure seemed to be to assign total appropriations, as reported in the Federal Budget, to indirect war outlays. The fact that AEC procurement now carries a “D.O.” priority rating indicates that the government considers this program an integral part of the “defense” program.
We have deliberately omitted inclusion of net interest on the national debt, now running well over $5 billion a year, from our concept of war outlays because the Department of Commerce in its basic revision of 1947 eliminated such payments from the national income and product. It may well be that government interest payments “do not represent currently produced goods and services or the current use of economic resources,” as Commerce contends, although even this would be true only when the government is operating at a deficit which exceeds total net interest payments on the national debt. We find most unconvincing, however, the statement in the July 1947 National Income Supplement to Survey of Current Business that “it seems sensible that a comparison of the prewar and “postwar volume of production should not be distorted by the continuing interest on the national debt that arose during the war.” On the contrary, the rise in the national debt and the enormous interest burden thereby created are basic characteristics of the Permanent War Economy and should be considered in any analysis of production or its distribution. While this is particularly true of the relationship between war outlays and total output, we refrain from making the adjustment in order to avoid any theoretical controversies, but we feel that this omission is an added reason for believing that our ratios of war output to total production are conservative.
 
THE RISE OF INDIRECT WAR OUTLAYS in the postwar period to a point where five per cent or more of total output is siphoned off by the government programs included under this concept is one of the basic characteristics of the Permanent War Economy. For American imperialism this represents an indefinite and apparently permanent burden. As the table shows, in the years 1947–1950 inclusive, indirect war outlays were virtually as important as direct war outlays with the former totaling $52 billion for the four-year period and the latter $54.4 billion. As a result, total war outlays even at their postwar nadir in 1948 amounted to $23.6 billion and took about 10 per cent of total output.
Naturally, the projected rise in indirect war outlays is dwarfed by comparison with the anticipated increase in direct war outlays. In fact, it is the precipitate growth in direct war outlays that imposes such a careful screening of, and relative curtailment in, indirect war outlays, for there is a limit to the economic strength of American imperialism.
Total war outlays, as shown in column (4), and their ratio to total output, as shown in column (6) of the above table, become the key instruments of analysis. It is only when these figures are examined that the true character of the Permanent War Economy emerges. Enormous production and enormous waste go hand-in-hand. They are both cause and effect of the huge volume of capital accumulation described in the previous article. We showed that total private gross capital formation averaged $39 billion annually in the five postwar years from 1946 to 1950 inclusive. During the same period, total war outlays averaged $28 billion a year. Imagine what would have happened to capital accumulation and to production if war outlays had returned to the negligible level of 1939 or before! In one sentence, the prophets of postwar depression would have been correct. By the same token, because of the inherent nature of capitalist production, total output could not be entirely devoted to civilian purposes without rapidly glutting the market and ushering in the previously typical capitalist crisis.
A corollary and yet basic feature of the Permanent War Economy is both the size and nature of state intervention in the economy, as revealed by the magnitude of total war outlays. Federal budgets of $40 billion and more become a permanent feature of the new stage of capitalism, with war outlays, direct and indirect, taking the bulk of Federal expenditures. This role of the “balancing” expenditures by the state was anticipated by Oakes, and we shall return to it in a subsequent article.
The peaks and valleys in the proportion of total output devoted to paying for wars, past, present and future, are not quite so extreme in variation once indirect war outlays have been added to direct war outlays. Nevertheless, the changes are rapid and qualitative in nature, which is another characteristic of the Permanent War Economy stage of capitalism. The figures suggest that about 10 per cent of total output must be spent in the form of war outlays before the latter become significant in their impact. This is quite reminiscent of the 10 per cent export level that characterized American imperialism prior to 1929. Its significance is comparable and for essentially the same reason. In those former days, without exporting 10 per cent of its output, the profitability of the remaining 90 per cent of the output of American capitalism that went to the domestic market would have been jeopardized. Similarly, today, without 10 per cent of its output going to war outlays, the profitability of civilian output would be endangered. We shall likewise elaborate on this point at another time.
What is most important for the development of the class struggle is what happens as the percentage of total war outlays to total output declines from 45 per cent to 10 per cent and then rises again to 20 per cent and more. Let us not forget that the ratio of war outlays to total output has become the prime mover of the economy! As the ratio rises above 10 per cent, production controls become necessary. The capitalist market loses its effectiveness as an allocator of resources. At or about the 20 per cent level, judging from past experience, the inflationary and class pressures become intolerable and distribution controls (rationing and price control) have to be instituted. At the 30 per cent level or thereabouts, large-scale war has already broken out and manpower controls are invoked to the extent the bourgeoisie considers feasible. At the 40 per cent level or above, total war has engulfed society and precious little remains of the normal functioning of capitalism.
 
BEFORE CONSIDERING THE PRACTICAL consequences of the Permanent War Economy, it is helpful to examine its theoretical foundations.
Under the heading The Problem of Unpaid Labor, Oakes analyzed the basic contradiction of capitalist society and showed why the “‘balancing’ expenditures on the part of government must take the form of war outlays rather than public works.” This, in essence, provides the theoretical foundation of the Permanent War Economy, and we summarize what he wrote on this subject.
“The root of all economic difficulties in a class society,” states Oakes, “lies in the fact that the ruling class appropriates (in accordance with the particular laws of motion of the given society) a portion of the labor expended by the working class or classes in the form of unpaid labor. The expropriation of this surplus labor presents its own set of problems; generally, however, they do not become crucial for the ruling class until the point is reached where it is necessary to pile up accumulations of unpaid labor. When these accumulations in turn beget new accumulations, then the stage of ‘primitive accumulation’ ... ceases and the stability of the society is threatened.”
In other words, it is the accumulation of capital that at bottom endangers the rule of the capitalists. Oakes continues:
“The ruling class is impaled on the horns of a most serious dilemma: to allow these growing and mature accumulations to enter into economic circulation means to undermine the very foundations of existing society (in modern terms, depression); to reduce or eliminate these expanding accumulations of unpaid labor requires the ruling class or sections of it to commit hara-kiri (in modern terms, the capitalist must cease being a capitalist or enter into bankruptcy). The latter solution is like asking capitalists to accept a 0 per cent rate of profit, because if they make 6 or 10 per cent they ... destroy the economic equilibrium. This is too perturbing a prospect; consequently, society as a whole must suffer the fate of economic disequilibrium unless the ruling class can bring its State to intervene in such a manner as to resolve this basic dilemma.” (Italics in original.)
Oakes then discusses the necessity for state intervention to immobilize excess accumulations of unpaid labor and how this problem was solved in Ancient Egypt by pyramid-building and in feudal times by the building of elaborate monasteries and shrines.
“Capitalist society,” he points out, “has had its own pyramids. These ostentatious expenditures, however, have failed to keep pace with the accumulation of capital. In recent times, the best examples have been the public works program of the New Deal and the road building program of Nazi Germany. Both have been accomplished through what is termed ‘deficit financing.’ That is, the state has borrowed capital (accumulated surplus labor for which there is no opportunity for profitable private investment) and consumed it by employing a portion of the unemployed millions, thus achieving a rough but temporarily workable equilibrium.
“While the Roosevelt and Hitler prewar ‘recovery’ programs had much in common, there is an important difference. The latter was clearly a military program ... In the United States, only a minor portion of the W.P.A. and P.W.A. programs possessed potential military usefulness. Consequently, as such expenditures increased, the opposition of the capitalist class rose ... The more money the state spent, the more these expenditures circumscribed and limited the opportunity for profitable private investment. The New Deal was dead before the war; the war merely resuscitated its political expression and was, in reality, an historical necessity.
“War expenditures accomplish the same purpose as public works, but in a manner that is decidedly more effective and more acceptable (from the capitalist point of view). In this, capitalism is again borrowing from the techniques employed by the more static class societies of slavery and feudalism. War outlays, in fact, have become the modern substitute for pyramids. They do not compete with private industry and they easily permit the employment of all those whom it is considered necessary to employ. True, this type of consumption (waste) of surplus labor brings with it a series of difficult political and economic problems. These, however, appear to be solvable; in any case, they can be postponed.”
Thus, the continued preservation of the capitalist mode of production, a system that has long outlived its historical usefulness, demands ever-increasing state intervention which must take the form of the Permanent War Economy. We need not concern ourselves with the many rationalizations whereby increasing war outlays are justified and accepted socially by all classes, although it is worth noting that: it is the propaganda of the bourgeoisie that penetrates all social layers and it is the bourgeoisie which decides what proportion war outlays shall be of total output. The Permanent War Economy, however, is a form of capitalism. The process of converting unpaid or surplus labor into surplus value, of which profits are but one form, still continues. Above all, capital is still accumulated and, as previously, it is the size, composition and rate of capital accumulation that provides the basic laws of motion of capitalism.
These laws, which were thoroughly analyzed by Marx, have been altered by the development of the Permanent War Economy, some quantitatively and some qualitatively. As Oakes puts it:
“The Marxian general law of capitalist accumulation may, for convenience, be expressed as two laws: namely, the inevitable tendencies toward the polarization of classes and the increase in unemployment. Today, however, this analysis no longer holds good without certain modifications.”
We do not entirely share Oakes’ conclusion concerning the slowing up of the rate of class polarization, but there is little doubt that he was correct in forecasting the relative elimination of unemployment.
 
“THE GREATER THE SOCIAL WEALTH, the functioning capital, the extent and energy of its growth, and, therefore, also the absolute mass of the proletariat and the productiveness of its labor,” said Marx in Capital (Kerr edition, Volume I, p.707), “the greater is the industrial reserve-army. The same causes which develop the expansive power of capital, develop also the labor-power at its disposal. The relative mass of the industrial reserve-army increases therefore with the potential energy of wealth. But the greater this reserve-army in proportion to the active labor-army, the greater is the mass of a consolidated surplus-population, whose misery is in inverse ratio to its torment of labor. The more extensive, finally, the lazarus-layers of the working class, and the industrial reserve-army, the greater is official pauperism. This is the absolute general law of capitalist accumulation.”
Without entering into all its ramifications, the decisive point for Marx was that as capitalism evolved, capital constantly accumulated and brought with it an increase in unemployment. Naturally, Marx was well aware that his statement had to be modified in many ways, especially in relation to the fluctuations of the business cycle. Yet, prior to the Permanent War Economy, this fundamental of Marxism was perhaps the most impressive characteristic of capitalism. That it no longer holds true may be seen by referring to the official figures on unemployment. (Table C)

The data on unemployment are compiled by the Bureau of the Census and include those fourteen years of age and over who are either looking for work or are on public emergency work projects. This official measure of unemployment refers to the non-institutional population and is based on a sample of 25,000 households in 68 areas. As such, it is admittedly subject to a wide margin of error, with the maximum difference between actual and estimated unemployment calculated at 18 per cent. While the series may not properly evaluate the level of unemployment, and actually conceals the millions of changes that occur monthly from the status of employed to unemployed or vice versa, as well as the changes into and out of the labor force, there is little doubt that it reflects the trend in unemployment.
In 1939 there were on the average almost 9,500,000 unemployed. This is typical of the decade of the 1930’s, for the peak year of unemployment was in 1933 when the average was 12,830,000. As the ratio of war outlays to total output increased, unemployment declined until in 1944 it fell to an average of 670,000. This is even below the so-called minimum “frictional” level of unemployment, representing those who are merely in process of changing from one job to another, which is usually placed at one million persons at a minimum. Then, as the ratio of war outlays to total output began to decline, unemployment increased until in 1949 it averaged almost 3,400,000. For the first half of 1950, unemployment averaged almost 3,900,000. With hostilities beginning in Korea came an increase in war outlays. Immediately, unemployment began to drop and by September was about two million. We may expect that in 1951 unemployment will average about one and one-half million and in 1952 and 1953, for all practical purposes, unemployment will be non-existent.
Thus, a 20 per cent ratio of war outlays to total output will now have the same effect on unemployment as a 40 per cent ratio had during the war. The reason is, of course, that the present increase in war outlays starts with the economy operating virtually at capacity. In other words, there is a close relationship between a high level of production and low unemployment, but the relationship is even closer in the case of the ratio of war outlays to total output, for war expenditures are the prime mover in bringing about capacity or near capacity production. Consider that at the peak of its pre-Permanent War Economy prosperity, in 1929, there was an average of 1,550,000 unemployed and one can readily see the tremendous impact of the Permanent War Economy on American capitalism!
The negligible character of unemployment under the Permanent War Economy, which is vital to the maintenance of a stable and safe economic equilibrium for the bourgeoisie, becomes even more apparent when we compare the level of unemployment with the size of the total labor force, as is done in Table D.

The volume of unemployment has particular relevance when related to the total labor force, for with the growth in population there are on the average several hundred thousand persons each year who seek employment as new entrants into the labor force. According to Marx, the greater the size of the proletariat, the greater the industrial reserve army. While pressures still operate in this direction, they are overcome (even if our figures were restricted to factory employment) by the ability of the Permanent War Economy to find “employment” for millions in the armed forces and in munitions industries. For example, in 1944 about 22,400,000 persons on the average were employed as workers in munitions industries, civilian employees in Federal war agencies and members of the armed forces. More than one-third of the total labor force at the peak of the war was thus completely unproductive in providing consumer goods and services.
The 32 per cent rise in civilian employment in a little more than a decade of the Permanent War Economy furnishes dramatic proof of the impact of war outlays on the productive capacity of the economy. The size of the armed forces (derived by subtracting the total civilian labor force from the total labor force, including the armed forces) naturally follows very closely the movement of war outlays and is further evidence of the highly volatile nature of the Permanent War Economy. Some question may be raised concerning the propriety of measuring the “unemployment ratio” in terms of the total labor force, including the armed forces, rather than by comparison with the total civilian labor force. The resulting pattern, however, would not be fundamentally different and the relatively large size of the armed forces is one of the basic characteristics of the Permanent War Economy.
More than one person in every six was unemployed in 1939 against one in every four in 1933. The limited and precarious character of the recovery under the New Deal is thus apparent. The unemployment ratio then declined from 17.1 per cent in 1939 to the fantastically low figure of one per cent in 1944. This compares with an unemployment ratio of 3.1 per cent in 1929. Even with the curtailment of war outlays following 1944, the unemployment ratio does not become much greater than in 1929. We can now expect a further sharp decline in the unemployment ratio to 2.5 per cent in 1951, 1.5 per cent in 1952 and less than one per cent in 1953. No wonder Washington is reported to be considering the drafting of women if and when the plunge is made to conscript all manpower!
 
THE BASIC CHARACTERISTICS of the Permanent War Economy are the permanence of the sizable level of war outlays, which have become a legitimate expression of growing state intervention in the economy, and the high rates of capital accumulation and production accompanied by insignificant levels of unemployment. If there were no other consequences, aside from the danger of mortal defeat in battle, it might be assumed that the capitalist system had acquired a new lease on life. While it is true, as Lenin was fond of stressing, that “there is no absolutely hopeless situation for the bourgeoisie,” thereby implying the necessity of the conscious intervention of the proletariat in leading mankind on the road toward the socialist emancipation of society, the development of the Permanent War Economy does give rise to new problems, and aggravates old problems, that continually threaten to undermine the foundations of capitalism. We shall comment briefly on the more important differences from “normal” capitalist operation and, in subsequent articles, develop at some length those aspects of the Permanent War Economy that are of particular significance to the working class.
1. Standards of living decline. To quote Oakes:
“If the Permanent War Economy succeeds in stabilizing the economy at a high level, unemployment will be eliminated, but only through employment in lines that are economically unproductive. Thus capitalist accumulation instead of bringing about an increase in unemployment, will have as its major consequence a decline in the standard of living. (Italics in original) ... At first, of course, there may be a rise in the average standard of living if [there is an increase in real national income] and if, simultaneously, there is a sharp reduction in total military outlays [from the wartime peak] ... Within a relatively short period, however, assuming that the economy is stabilized at the desired level with a minimum of unproductive governmental expenditures, the maintenance of economic equilibrium will require a steadily rising curve of military outlays. The decline in the average standard of living of the workers, at first relative, will then become absolute – particularly on a world scale as all nations adapt their internal economies to conform with the requirements of the new order based on an international Permanent War Economy. Naturally, the decline will not be a descending straight line; it will have its ups and downs, but the long-term trend will definitely be downward.”
It follows, of course, that with the economy operating at capacity an increase in war output requires a corresponding decrease in civilian output. Therefore, the average standard of living must decline, but the burden of declining standards of living will be disproportionately heavy on the low-income groups, especially the working class.
2. State intervention increases. The market mechanism cannot be relied upon to allocate resources in accordance with the new, dual end-purposes of economic activity. Accordingly, to meet the requirements of the war sector and ultimately of the civilian sector, more and more state controls are imposed upon the body economic. There is a permanent growth in the state bureaucracy, with the state, in effect, guaranteeing the profits of the bourgeoisie. Both profits and production remain at very high levels, as does employment. In this connection Oakes made his most serious mistake, as he apparently did not fully take into account the implications of his own theory and therefore understated future levels of both production and employment.
3. Capital accumulates rapidly. Not only do private capital accumulations remain at extremely high levels, but state capital accumulations increase with the growth in the ratio of war outlays to total output. The large demand for capital rapidly exhausts the supplies of idle capital and an overall shortage of capital develops. Accordingly, normal pressures to increase the rate of surplus value are reinforced by the insatiable appetite of the state to dispose of the fruits of past and present labor. Through increased taxation and related fiscal policies, the state consumes a relatively larger portion of total output. The natural tendency toward a declining standard of living is therefore accelerated.
4. Bonapartist tendencies develop. The proletariat increases in size both absolutely and relatively to the growth in the working population. The greater economic strength of the American proletariat is in sharp contrast to the weakness of its political strength, and the danger of the class struggle erupting and seriously interfering with the ability of the state to carry out all the individual programs that add up to the Permanent War Economy is ever present. At the same time, the bourgeoisie increasingly penetrates the organs of the state. On both counts, it therefore becomes necessary for the state to give the appearance of being “above classes” and to “freeze” the class struggle in the role of “impartial” umpire. The growing executive power of the state and the interlocking directorates between big business and the higher military echelons will ultimately spell the doom of bourgeois democracy.
5. Military-economic imperialism grows. Increasingly, the state must finance and guarantee international trade and investments. Exports of private finance capital, hitherto the traditional mode of operation of “democratic” imperialism, steadily diminish in importance despite all efforts to revive them. The American state enters permanently into the foreign economic field through various types of “relief and rehabilitation” programs. These programs, in turn, are subordinated to military aid as American imperialism seeks to overcome its relative deficiency in manpower by seeking allies in the struggle to contain and eventually to eliminate Stalinist imperialism. The nationalist revolutions of colonial areas, especially in Asia, present virtually an insoluble problem for American imperialism and are compelled by the desire to survive to move in the direction of third campism.
6. Inflation is irresistible. The greater the percentage of war outlays to total output, the greater the inflationary pressure on the economy. This general law of the Permanent War Economy operates at all stages, but becomes more apparent when the economy is running at full capacity. Anti-inflationary techniques cannot halt the inflation, which arises from the relative excess of consumer spending power in comparison with the available supply of consumer goods and services, but can only slow it down and modify its class impact. The major battles of the class struggle, in fact, will arise over the question of who shall pay for the increase in war outlays and which class shall bear the major burden of inflation.
The Permanent War Economy, in brief, offers no hope of solving the basic problems of humanity. It represents a further stage on the road to barbarism and is the inevitable price the world proletariat must pay for its failure to put an end to both capitalism and Stalinism. It does, however, exist and only fools and demagogues will base their politics on the assumption that nothing has changed. We must find ways and means of coping with the problems of living under the Permanent War Economy or resign ourselves to defending the slaves of totalitarianism and ultimately to the atomization of most of organized society.

1. Editor’s Note: The President’s budget message recommends an expenditure of $41.4 billion for military services during the coming fiscal year, corresponding rather closely to the author’s forecasts.
 



It is precisely in its international aspects that the new stage of capitalism, which we have termed the Permanent War Economy, reveals most clearly its true character as well as its inability to solve any of the fundamental problems of mankind. This is not due to any failure on the part of the American state to recognize the decisive importance of foreign economic policy, as witness both the Gray and Rockefeller reports within the past year, but rather to the historical impasse in which capitalism finds itself.
The capitalist world is not what it was in 1919 or in 1929. Even the depression-shrunk capitalist market of 1939 was relatively larger, and offered greater opportunities for profitable investment of American surplus capital, than the crisis-ridden world of today, confronted as it is with the unrelenting pressure exerted by Stalinist imperialism. Just as the domestic economy is increasingly dominated by the impact of war outlays, both direct and indirect, even more so is foreign policy in every ramification subordinated to military (euphoniously termed “security”) considerations.
The tragedy of the situation, from the point of view of American imperialism, as we have previously pointed out (see especially After Korea – What? in the November–December 1950 issue of The New International) and as the more far-sighted representatives of the bourgeoisie perceive, is that American imperialism cannot hope to defeat Stalinist imperialism by other than military means; and yet a military victory, even if it be achieved, threatens to destroy the very foundations upon which capitalism now rests. Not only would the military defeat of Stalinist imperialism remove the entire political base upon which the Permanent War Economy depends for justification of huge war outlays, without which the economy would collapse, but the very process of achieving a military solution of the mortal threat posed by the existence of an aggressive Stalinist imperialism is guaranteed to complete the political isolation of American imperialism undermine its economic foundations and unleash socialist revolution on a world scale.
 
THE ARENA OF STRUGGLE between American and Stalinist imperialism is truly global, but it necessarily centers on Europe and Asia. There are sound economic reasons for increasing American preoccupation with these areas; aside from their obvious political importance as actual or potential foci of Third Campism. As Defense Mobilizer Charles E. Wilson graphically points out in his second quarterly report (New York Times, July 5, 1951):
Potentially, the United States is the most powerful country in the world but we cannot undertake to resist world communism without our allies. Neither we nor any other free nation can stand alone long without, inviting encirclement and subjugation.
If either of the two critical areas on the border of the communist world – Western Europe or Asia – were to be overrun by communism, the rest of the free world would be immensely weakened, not only in the morale that grows out of the solidarity of free countries but also in the economic and military strength that would be required to resist further aggression. Western Europe, for instance, has the greatest industrial concentration in the world outside of the United States. Its strategic location and military potential are key factors in the free world’s defense against Soviet aggression.
If Western Europe fell, the Soviet Union would gain control of almost 300 million people, including the largest pool of skilled manpower in the world. Its steel production would be increased by 55 million tons a year to 94 million tons, a total almost equal to our own production. Its coal production would jump to 950 million tons, compared to our 550 million. Electric energy in areas of Soviet domination would be increased from 130 to 350 billion kilowatt-hours, or almost up to our 400 billion.
Raw materials from other areas of the free world are the lifeblood of industry in the United States and Western Europe. If the Kremlin overran Asia, it would boost its share of the world’s oil reserves from 6 per cent to over half ... and it would control virtually all of the world’s natural rubber supply and vast quantities of other materials vital to rearmament.
And in manpower, in the long run apt to be the final arbiter, should Stalinism conquer Europe and Asia, American imperialism would be outnumbered by a ratio of at least four to one!
In the words of the Gray Report to the President on Foreign Economic Policies (New York Times, Nov. 13, 1950):
We have now entered a new phase of foreign economic relations. The necessity for rapidly building defensive strength now confronts this nation and other free nations as well. This requires a shift in the use of our economic resources. It imposes new burdens on the gradually reviving economies of other nations. Our foreign economic policies must be adjusted to these new burdens ... Our own rearmament program will require us to import strategic raw materials in greater quantities than before.
Wilson, in his report previously cited, hints at the dependence of the American war economy on the minerals and raw materials of the “underdeveloped” areas:
“For most of these metals [cobalt, columbium, molybdenum, nickel and tungsten and other alloying metals] we are dependent primarily on foreign sources, and defense requirements of other nations are also increasing.”
It remains, however, for the Rockefeller report (Advisory Board on International Development, summarized in The New York Times, March 12, 1951) to place the problem of raw materials in proper perspective, and at the same time to reveal the weaknesses that have accumulated in the structure of American imperialism. The section is worth quoting in full:
With raw material shortages developing rapidly, an immediate step-up in the production of key minerals is vital if we are to be able to meet the growing military demands without harsh civilian curtailments.
Two billion dollars energetically and strategically invested over the next few years could swell the outflow of vital materials from the underdeveloped regions by $1,000,000,000 a year.
This increased production can best be carried out under private auspices and wherever possible local capital within the country should be encouraged to enter into partnership with United States investors in these projects.
Both immediate and longer-range peace needs warn of grave consequences unless such a development program is undertaken promptly. Although the United States accounts for more than half of the world’s heavy industry production, it mines only about a third of the world’s annual output of the fifteen basic minerals.
Soviet shipments to the United States of chrome and manganese, so essential for steel-making, have already been choked back. The advisory board hopes that the people in the Soviet-controlled areas will be able to regain their freedom. However, today their trade is tightly controlled.
In the manganese and tungsten deposits of Latin America, Africa and Asia, the chrome production of Turkey and the Philippines, the timber stands of Brazil and Chile, the pulpwood of Labrador lie resources for developing substitute sources for materials which come from areas now dominated by the Soviets or most vulnerable to aggression.
Continued dependence of the free nations upon imports and markets of Soviet controlled areas weakens them in enforcing measures of economic defense.
Peace, free institutions and human well-being can be assured only within the framework of an expanding world economy.
With an expanding productive base it will become possible to increase individual productivity, raise living levels, increase international trade, meet the needs of the growing populations in the underdeveloped areas and perhaps even resettle peoples from the industrial areas under growing population pressure.
Our objective should not be to “mine and get out”  but to strive for a balanced economic development which will lay an enduring base for continued economic progress. Workers should receive a full share in the benefits as quickly as possible.
Improving the standard of living of the people of the underdeveloped areas is a definite strategic objective of the United States foreign policy.
The advisory board recommends the continued encouragement of the free labor unions in the underdeveloped areas.
And that the International Labor Organization’s recommendations as to fair labor standards be used as a guide for minimum labor standards in the underdeveloped areas. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Actually, coincident with the outbreak of the Korean war, American imperialism was aware of its vulnerability in strategic materials in the event of continuing “hot” and “cold” war with Stalinist imperialism and sought to remedy the situation. As Paul P. Kennedy puts it in The New York Times of August 5, 1951:
The shift in emphasis from purely economic to economic-military aid within the foreign assistance program began to take vague shape as early as July 1950. At that time Mr. Foster, in something of a surprise move, advocated the diversion, in some countries, of ECA matching funds toward military production facilities.
The Administration has requested $8.5 billion for fiscal 1952, of which $6.3 billion would be in military aid and $2.2 billion for continued economic aid. Economic assistance is now defined as “providing resources necessary for the support of adequate defense efforts and for the maintenance, during defense mobilization, of the country’s general economic stability.” In view of the strong outburst by that staunch defender of democracy and the Democratic Party, Senator Connally of Texas, that “the United States can’t support the whole free world and remain solvent,” it may be wondered why there should be any bourgeois opposition to a program geared exclusively to serving the military-economic needs of American imperialism. The answer lies in two facets of the program that have not been as well publicized as the immediate request for $8.5 billion.
It now appears that the $8.5 billion is intended as only part of a three-year $25 billion program. Mr. Kennedy, in the same article previously cited, states:
“Both Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall have estimated that there is little possibility of building up the free world’s fighting force on less than the $8.5 billion the first year, which would be the first installment of $25 billion over a three-year spread.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
This is approximately twice as large as forecasts made earlier in the year by Administration spokesmen. Admittedly a large portion of Military Assistance funds will go to Asia and the Pacific area.
Again quoting Mr. Kennedy:
“The ECA answer to Senator Connally’s charge that the United States is, spreading itself too thin by going into Asia and the Pacific area is that; production of materials is the greatest present problem. To get the materials available in Asia, the United States must give in exchange technical and economic assistance, the agency contends.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
 
THE INCREASING DEPENDENCE of American imperialism on foreign sources, chiefly present or former colonial areas, of key raw materials is attributable to many causes. Rapid exhaustion of natural resources, particularly iron ore and petroleum, within the United States, in response to the almost insatiable appetite of the Permanent War Economy for means of destruction and the ability to transport and operate them, is clearly a factor of considerable importance. Along with this has gone the sizable increase in production, coupled with tremendous accumulations of capital, analyzed in previous articles in this series. Historically, however, the decisive factor has been the utter failure of American imperialism to operate in the traditional finance capital manner.
This failure has not been due to any lack of desire on the part of American imperialism to export a sizable portion of its accumulations of private capital, thereby acquiring both markets and sources of primary materials in sufficient quantities to maintain the domestic level of profit and simultaneously to assure a steady flow of those raw materials essential to industry in war or peace. In part, this development has been due to the fateful consequences of the Permanent War Economy. The state, as demonstrated in the May–June 1951 issue of The New International, guarantees profits for all practical purposes. The market incentives to export 10 per cent or more of both production and accumulated capital, traditional in the first three decades of the twentieth century, in order to maintain the profitability of industry as a whole, have atrophied to a surprising extent. The state now consumes the largest portion of accumulated capital. The state likewise undertakes by far the major responsibility for capital exports in the form of government loans and grants. The nature of state capital exports is such, with political considerations predominant, that markets and raw materials tend to be reduced in importance.
In largest part, however, the failure of American imperialism to perform according to the early textbooks is traceable to steady dwindling of the world capitalist market. How can American capitalists invest in Chinese tungsten mines, when China has come within the orbit of Stalinism and American capital has been forcefully driven out of China? Such examples of forcible exclusions of American imperialism from important sources of strategic materials could be multiplied many times since the advance of Stalinist imperialism in the post-World War II period.
Even more significant, however, is the fact that in the non-Stalinist world the climate for American investments has not been exactly favorable. Nationalization, confiscation, the threat of expropriation, and a host of other factors have combined to make private American capitalists extremely cautious about investing surplus capital in any foreign enterprise. This was not the case in the 1920’s, when American net foreign investments increased about 100 per cent during the decade ending in 1931, at which time they reached a peak variously estimated at between $15 billion and $18 billion.
Considering the increases that have occurred in production, accumulation of capital, and the price level, a comparable figure for today would be in the neighborhood of $50 billion! Yet, despite the absence of data, it is clear that American net foreign investments today are lower than they were in 1931. What the precise figure is we cannot say, as recently the first such census since before the war was undertaken by the Department of Commerce and the results will not be available for another year. Nevertheless, according to The New York Times of May 31, 1951, which reported the news of the new census, “Sample data collected by the Department of Commerce in recent years indicate that the new census will show a value of more than $13,000,000,000.” This figure represents direct investments as distinct from portfolio investments, but it is most unlikely that portfolio investments will be more than a few billion dollars, as bonds of foreign governments have not proved very attractive to American investors after the sad experiences of widespread defaults in the 1920’s and 1930’s.
The fact of the matter is that, from the point of view of American imperialism, American net foreign investments should be at least three times their present level. But this is a manifest impossibility, both politically and economically. Neither the capital nor the market is available, even if all the necessary incentives were present, which is obviously not the case.
It may be easier to grasp the magnitude of the problem that confronts American imperialism today if we first look at the figures representing the heyday of American imperialism and then compare them with the present situation. The following tabulation portrays the movement of American foreign investments, both gross and net, from 1924 to 1930.

*Includes new foreign loans plus new net direct foreign investment.
†Total foreign investment minus amortization receipts and net sales of outstanding
foreign securities.



The data are based on The United Slates in the World Economy (US Department of Commerce, 1943) and taken from a paper, Foreign Investment and American Employment, delivered by Randall Hinshaw of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System before the 1946 annual meeting of the American Economics Association. During this seven-year period, gross foreign investment was never less than $1 billion in any one year, and averaged over $1.2 billion annually. The large proportion of portfolio investments that existed resulted in heavy amortization payments which, together with net sales by American investors of outstanding foreign securities, reduced the net foreign investment during this period to an average of $764 million. The sizable difference between gross and net foreign investment in 1930 is due to the onset of the world crisis and the large-scale liquidation by Americans of foreign investments which, in turn, aggravated the world crisis.
During the 1930’s, the world-wide depression, plus the acts and threats of Nazi imperialism, caused a shrinkage of American foreign investments of about $4 billion. The Department of Commerce thus estimates total American foreign investments at the end of 1939 at $11,365,000,000. It is apparent that there was a further decline during the war and, beginning in 1946, a relatively modest increase. While the estimates of American foreign investments in the postwar period are undoubtedly quite crude, we summarize below the movement of United States private long-term capital (from the June 1951 issue of Survey of Current Business) as indicative of the pitifully low levels to which traditional American imperialism has sunk:

*Includes total of direct foreign investments plus other investments,
as loans, and is not comparable to the similar column in the previous
table for 1924–1930, which is net of direct investments.
†This column is conceptually comparable to the similar column in the
previous table.



While an average net foreign investment of $904 million appears to be significantly higher than the $764 million shown for the period 1924–1930, such a conclusion would be totally misleading. In the first place, the higher figure for 1950 is due entirely to a sharp bulge in the third quarter, amounting to $698 million, which is mostly in the form of portfolio investments, obviously a result of a sharp flight of capital from the dollar following the outbreak of the Korean war. That this was a temporary phenomenon, not possibly to be confused with any resurgence of traditional American imperialism, is shown by the sharp drop in the fourth quarter of 1950 to a mere $60 million of net foreign investment. Moreover, the preliminary figure for the first quarter of 1951 is only $212 million.
In other words, in dollar terms, net foreign investments of American capital are currently at the same level as twenty years ago. While this amount was consistent with the requirements of an expanding American imperialism at that time, today it is nothing but a source of frustration to the policy-makers among the bourgeoisie. For, these exports of private capital are taking place today when gross private domestic investment is averaging about $40 billion annually or more, and when net private capital formation runs from $25–30 billion a year. Net foreign investments at present should actually be at least four times their current level in order merely to match the performance of two decades ago. Another way of expressing the same thought is to equate the present volume of net foreign investments to about $200 million annually to permit direct comparison with the pre-depression period. It is therefore hardly surprising that American imperialism is having difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies of the key raw materials required to keep the economy operating at capacity.
Without doubt, exact information on the changing character and composition of American foreign investments, particularly direct investments, would throw even more light on the raw materials shortage. Unfortunately, it is not even possible to guess at the profound changes that must have taken place during and since the war. We would expect the trend that manifested itself prior to the war, when between 1929 and 1939 American investments in the Western Hemisphere increased from 59 per cent of the total to 70 per cent, to have continued. To be sure, the Western Hemisphere is not exactly barren of raw materials, but aside from a relatively few projects, in such countries as Venezuela and Bolivia, the emphasis has not been on the mining of strategic minerals. Thus, the disparity between the needs of the Permanent War Economy and the ability of American imperialists to deliver the necessary raw materials may be even greater than the dollar figures on foreign investments would indicate.
 
THE VACUUM CAUSED BY the paucity of private exports of capital has had to be filled by the state. That is the primary significance of the Marshall Plan and all other state foreign aid programs. The amounts have been quite sizable, averaging about $5 billion annually since the end of World War II, even according to the admittedly conservative figures of the Department of Commerce (as reported in the March 1951 Survey of Current Business). The data, by country, are shown in the tabulation below.

*Assistance that takes the form of an outright gift for which no payment is
expected, or which at most involves an obligation on the part of the receiver
to extend reciprocal aid to the US or other countries.
†Assistance under an agreement that calls for ultimate repayment.



Gross foreign aid by the American government during this period totaled about $30.2 billion, but reverse grants and returns on grants plus principal collected on credits equaled $2.4 billion, bringing the net total to $27.8 billion. How much of the $9.2 billion of credits will be returned and how, much will ultimately assume the: status of outright gifts remains to be seen. It is interesting to note, however, that as of December 31, 1950, according to the Department of Commerce,
“World War I indebtedness [owing to the United States government] amounted to $16,276 million, of which $4,842 million represented interest which was due and unpaid.”
It is also pertinent to observe that preliminary figures for the first quarter of 1951 indicate that net foreign aid exceeded $1.1 billion, amounting at an annual rate to about $4.5 billion for the year. The probability is that the actual figure will exceed $5 billion, as the transition from economic to military aid is well under way.
With two-thirds of net grants and almost 90 per cent of net credits having gone to Marshall Plan countries, the result has been that these major allies being sought by American imperialism have received almost three-fourths of total net foreign aid extended since the end of World War II. Clearly, there is room for expansion of aid in many directions to hoped-for and deserving allies, actual or potential. Nor will, the fact that almost one-half of total net foreign aid has been awarded to Britain, France and Germany escape the attention of those who appreciate the full significance of American military-economic strategy.
The policy of purchasing allies with government grants and credits in order better to contain expanding Stalinist imperialism did not originate with the Marshall Plan, which began operations in April 1948. As a matter of record, more than one-half of total net foreign aid ($14.5 billion out of the $27.8 billion total) was disbursed prior to the launching of the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan merely continued an already established policy by changing somewhat the form of aid and creating a new agency to administer it.
Some of the major categories that received forcing aid (on a gross basis) prior to April 1948 are:



 


(Millions
of Dollars)




Special British loan


$  3,760




UNRRA, post-UNRRA, and interim aid


    3,172




Civilian supplies


    2,360




Export-Import Bank loans


    2,087




Lend-Lease


    1,968




Surplus property (incl. merchant ships)


    1,234




TOTAL


$14,571



Thus, these six categories accounted for the overwhelming bulk of foreign aid prior to the ECA program. They reveal quite clearly the unique rôle of “relief and rehabilitation”  under the Permanent War Economy. It will be recalled that from 1946–1950 (see Basic Characteristics of the Permanent War Economy in January–February 1951 issue of The New International) indirect war outlays played a crucial role in maintaining the ratio of war outlays to total output at the 10 per cent level. Virtually equal in magnitude to direct war outlays, indirect war outlays were indispensable in maintaining the Permanent War Economy at a successful rate. And expenditures for relief and rehabilitation averaged about one-third of total indirect war outlays during this period. As a matter of fact, there is good evidence to believe that if proper valuation were given to Army-administered supplies, especially in Germany, and Japan, the role of relief and rehabilitation would be even greater than the figures indicate.
Naturally, a large portion of the billions of dollars spent for relief and rehabilitation fulfilled humanitarian purposes. Nor is it possible or necessary to assess the motives that animated Washington at this time. The decisive fact is that relief and rehabilitation expenditures, accomplished what private export of capital could not. The state began to acquire a major interest in foreign economic programs, as well as to relieve any pressure that might develop due to the rapid accumulation of capital. If, in the process, recipients of state foreign aid were “persuaded” to grant American imperialism military bases and to pursue various political and economic policies desired by Washington, so much the better. The quid pro quo generally present in American foreign aid programs became even more obvious with the launching of the Marshall Plan. Objectively, therefore, state foreign aid has served to fill the void left by the failure of private capital to function in a traditional imperialist manner and has served to bolster the political program of American imperialism.
 
ADMITTED MILITARY AID is now rapidly supplanting economic aid. In reality, of course, the entire foreign aid program directly or indirectly contributes to the grand strategy of American military policy. In this respect, state intervention in the foreign economic field parallels, and even leads, state intervention in the domestic economy, as increasingly a higher proportion of state expenditures are for “defense” purposes. While it is true that the program officially labeled “Mutual Defense Assistance Program,”  apparently to be called by Congress “Mutual Security Program,” spent the $516 million included in the total foreign aid analyzed above in the year 1950, it would be a mistake to conclude that admitted military aid occurred only during the past year. For example, there is the so-called Greek-Turkish aid program, which by the end of 1950 had disbursed some $656 million. Of this amount, $165 million was spent prior to the launching of the Marshall Plan, $258 million during the last nine months of 1948, $172 million in 1949, and $61 million in 1950. That this program has been overwhelmingly military in character can hardly be denied. Other programs, such as China, smaller in monetary cost, could be mentioned. As the chart shows, even on the official definition, there has always been some military aid since the end of World War II. Through the first quarter of 1951, military foreign aid has admittedly reached $2 billion. In reality, of course, the figure has been much higher, and now openly exceeds so-called foreign economic aid.






From the New York Times, Aug. 5, 1951



By 1952, admitted military foreign aid is expected to account for three-fourths of total foreign aid. This is without half a billion dollars which overseas bases, included in the military construction program. Officially labeled economic foreign aid, which reached a peak exceeding $8 billion in. 1948, and has been averaging about $5 billion annually, will decline; to an estimated $2 billion. On this basis, even a recalcitrant Congress may be expected to continue to vote for these sizable outlays without too much difficulty. The possibilities of further increasing state foreign aid through pouring dollars into the bottomless pit of “mutual security” are clearly almost without limit. Increasing war outlays have no lack of justifications from the apologists for. and representatives of the bourgeoisie. For sheer brazenness, however, we doubt that the reasons attributed to ECA administrator Foster as justifying the shift from economic to military aid can be equaled.
The arguments forwarded by the administrator at that time [July 1950, as reported by Mr. Kennedy in the aforementioned dispatch to the New York Times] have become more elaborate in proportion to increasing international tension, but basically they are the same arguments now being posed. These are:

(1) Most of the Marshall Plan participating countries are now far enough advanced economically to direct their attention from internal problems to those of possible aggression.
(2) An economy that has been restored must progress in the assurance of protective strength. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)

While comment would be entirely superfluous, under this line of reasoning economic aid would necessarily have to be a prelude to military aid. American imperialism has no choice, nor does it grant any choice to its satellites. The slogan, publicly and privately, becomes: “Join our military camp, or no aid.” While Washington is unduly sensitive to the term, here is a classic expression of imperialist coercion, albeit with new motives and new methods, but with the same tragic results of war, misery and starvation for the masses of humanity.
As we have previously observed, the Permanent War Economy becomes increasingly international in scope, bringing within the orbit of American imperialism every industry and population as yet outside of the orbit of Stalinist imperialism. A detailed analysis of the increase in the ratio of war outlays to total production in England, France and the rest of the non-Stalinist world is unnecessary, nor does space permit. It suffices to point out the rapid rate of increase in the “defense” budgets of the North Atlantic Treaty powers in 1951 as compared with 1950. These increases, according to the New York Times of May 27, 1951, are: Norway, 117 per cent; Denmark, 67 per cent; United Kingdom, 53 per cent; Italy, 53 per cent; France, 45 per cent; and the Benelux countries, 39 per cent. Nor are the bases from which these increasing military expenditures start entirely negligible in terms of the proportion of total output already devoted to means of destruction. The Wilson report, for example, states:
“Our European allies have increased their planned rate of defense expenditures from approximately $4.5 billion a year prior to the Korean conflict to almost $8 billion in 1951. Higher spending rates are projected for subsequent periods.”
It is no wonder, therefore, that Western European capitalism, operating on such an unstable foundation compared with the United States, has already experienced an inflation exceeding the American during the past year. The social consequences in every country, particularly Britain, are profound, but outside the scope of our analysis. Moreover, because of the dominant position of America in the world’s markets, especially in the present scramble for critical raw materials, the economies of every non-Stalinist country, even those with considerable nationalization and far-reaching state controls, are at the mercy of every whim and vagary of Washington, planned, or capricious. Under the circumstances, the low state of American popularity throughout the non-Stalinist world should not be a surprise to the American bourgeoisie.
 
THE IMPACT OF THIS NEW PHASE OF American imperialism is far broader in its foreign implications than would appear merely from an analysis of the increase in armaments budgets throughout the world, or from the changes in national economies resulting from inflation and steadily increasing state intervention. Precisely because the new method of sustaining American imperialism is geared to the needs of American military strategy, the ultimate consequences may be so far-reaching as to destroy the remaining foundations of capitalism. To combat a Stalinist imperialism operating from the base of bureaucratic collectivism, with its ability to subordinate all its satellite economies to the demands of Moscow and to standardize military equipment, procurement and transportation, requires a more or less comparable “internationalization of war preparations” on the part of American imperialism and its more indispensable allies in Western Europe.
It may still be possible in some circles to question the relative superiority of a nationalized economy over competitive capitalism in ordinary matters of production and distribution, but in the conduct of modern war, and therefore of war preparations, even a bureaucratic, brutal and horribly inefficient Stalinism is incomparably more successful in achieving the necessary coordination and integration of its war-making potential, due to its collectivist base, than the most highly developed capitalist nations could ever hope to achieve without vast structural changes. Under the impact of common financing, centralized administration cutting across national boundaries, standardization of armaments, and pooling of production resources – all of which are indispensable if American imperialism has any hopes of defending Western Europe against Stalinism – national sovereignty must be subordinated to the superior power, economic and military, and wisdom emanating from Washington and its representatives, especially Eisenhower.
A remarkable article on this entire problem, by its chief European economic reporter, Michael L. Hoffman, appeared in the New York Times of Aug. 5, 1951. Its analytical portion is worth reproducing in full:
Nobody can foresee with anything like exactness just how this [a common military budget and a common military procurement administration] would affect the economy of Europe. But European and United States economists have considered the matter fairly carefully already, and the following are some of the consequences that can now be predicted with some degree of confidence.
For practical purposes, national parliaments would lose control of from one-third to nearly half of their own national budgets. They could complain, or refuse to vote taxes, or make all kinds of other trouble, but once in the European army a government would pretty much have to accept its defense burden as given.
It would be quite inconceivable that this degree of rigidity could be introduced into national government budgets without bringing in its train a far greater degree of coordination in budgeting generally than exists now.
Every participating country would acquire suddenly an entirely new kind of interest in its neighbors’ prosperity. It is true now, but not very deeply burned into the consciousness of most people, that Germany cannot thrive without France, France without Italy, and so on. This would become obvious if the taxpayers saw their burdens mounting because some other country could not support a larger share.
Discussions of trade and monetary policy would take place in an entirely new atmosphere, in which everybody would be forced to keep an eye on Europe as a whole.
It could be expected, at the very least, that the duplication and misdirection of investment caused by uncoordinated national armament programs would be reduced greatly. The range of industry affected by military procurement under modern conditions is so great that a unified procurement service for a European army would become the outstanding market for a large number of European industries.
It has been Europe’s experience for ages that the growth of armed forces under the control of governments with sovereignty over larger and larger territorial units generally has been followed by the establishment of currencies, commercial law and other social institutions on a larger and larger territorial basis. There is nothing inevitable about this progression, but those European and United States leaders and officials who have been convinced of the necessity for getting rid of national barriers to economic expansion in Western Europe like to believe that the “law” will work once again. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
In reality, of course, such integration and coordination as may be achieved in Western Europe can only occur under the stimulus, organization and direction of American imperialism. European capitalism is long since incapable of saving itself. Were it not for the aid and support received from the American bourgeoisie, the European bourgeoisie would have abdicated or been overthrown. Farfetched and alarming as it may seem, the Kautskyian theory of “ultra-imperialism”  may yet see its realization, in the event the Third Camp fails to intervene actively in the course of history before it is too late, in the form of world hegemony being achieved by either American or Stalinist imperialism.
The role of military aid in the new phase of American imperialist development will be even more pervasive and all-embracing than the role of relief and rehabilitation. With overriding priority over materials, production facilities and manpower, military aid appears to be the vehicle that will permit American imperialism to complete its task of subjugating the economies of the lesser capitalist imperialist powers, of controlling their basic international policies, of influencing their domestic policies, and, above all, of dominating their colonial markets and trade. Naturally, there will be struggles, intense social conflicts, in many countries where the ability and will to resist subordination of legitimate class and national interests to Washington remains. Stalinism will naturally seek to exploit these contradictions wherever they appear. What the outcome of these complex stresses and strains will be may well determine the course of history for decades. Of one thing, however, we may be absolutely certain: the restoration of traditional American finance capital imperialism to sound health is excluded.
 
THE NEW POLICY OF AMERICAN imperialism, judging by its most eminent official and private spokesmen, is heartily in favor of the bloodless conquest of Europe and its empires, yet it seeks to accomplish this strategic aim by emphasizing the old, traditional methods, while paying lip-service to the new methods imposed by the exigencies of the times. The objective of European political union, with implied American control, has been voiced by innumerable leaders of the American bourgeoisie. Notable among these has been Mr. R.C. Leffingwell, head of the House of Morgan, who in an article in Foreign Affairs for January 1950, entitled Devaluation and European Recovery, states:
“Monetary union without political union is impossible. There cannot be a common currency without common sovereignty and a common parliament and common taxes and common expenditures.”
Or, in the more oblique language of the Gray report (recommendation 21):
“The United States should help to strengthen appropriate international and regional organizations and to increase the scope of their activities. It should be prepared, in so far as practicable, to support their activities us the best method of achieving the economic and security objectives which it shares with other free nations.”
In the area of investment policy, the key to imperialist activity and perspectives, the language of publicly enunciated foreign economic policy more clearly parallels that of private sources. Leffingwell, for example, in the article cited above, comments on the fundamental contradiction of American imperialism as a creditor nation with a large favorable balance of trade, as follows:
As a creditor nation, our tariffs should be for revenue only, except where needed to protect industries essential for the national defense ... What we need to do is to increase our imports more than we increase our exports ... Private American foreign investment would help. Indeed, the fundamental trade disequilibrium is so great that the international accounts can scarcely be balanced without great American investment overseas, both public and private ... If American foreign investment is to be encouraged, our government and foreign governments must reverse their policies and give firm assurance to American investors that their investments will be respected and protected, and that they may hope to profit by them, and collect their profits.
Almost as forthright is the Gray report:
Private investment should be considered as the most desirable means of providing’ capital and its scope should be widened as far as possible ... Further study should be given to the desirability and possibility of promoting private investment through tax incentives, in areas where economic development will promote mutual interests, but where political uncertainty now handicaps United States private investment.
Two specific steps are advocated for immediate action to stimulate private investment:
“(a) The negotiations of investment treaties to encourage private investment should be expedited; (b) The bill to authorize government guaranties of private investment against the risks of non-convertibility and expropriation should be enacted as a worthwhile experiment.”
Since all this encouragement of private investment may be expected to remain confined to paper, the Gray report also places “heavy reliance” on public lending, and seeks to “make sure that our own house is in order – that we have eliminated unnecessary barriers to imports, and that our policies in such fields as agriculture and shipping are so adjusted that they do not impose undue burdens on world trade.”
Here, again, the public spokesman must be more circumspect than the private. Says the Gray report:
“With respect to our own agricultural policies we should, over the long-run, attempt to modify our price support system, and our methods of surplus disposal and accumulation of stocks, in ways which, while consistent with domestic objectives, will be helpful to our foreign relations.”
Such double talk, together with the limitation proposed for shipping subsidies, is, of course, aimed at achieving the same objective as Leffingwell: abandonment of the American farmer so that industry may resume its customary exports of commodities and private capital.
 
EVER SINCE 1917, WHEN THE UNITED States became a creditor nation, the basic contradiction inherent in a finance capital imperialist nation exporting private capital while simultaneously maintaining a substantial export surplus in commodities and services has become more acute. The essence of the problem is clearly the necessity to make it possible for recipients of American private capital to pay the carrying charges, to remit the profits, and ultimately to repay the loans and investments. In the 1920s the problem was solved through large-scale remittances abroad of recent immigrants to the United States, coupled with ultimate repudiation of a substantial portion of American-held foreign securities. In the long run, however, if American imperialism is to function in the traditional manner, the United States must import more than it exports; i.e., it must acquire an unfavorable balance of trade sufficient to cover the tribute exacted by American capital. To be sure, remittances of gold temporarily help to achieve the necessary balance, but the United States has long since acquired the overwhelming portion of the world’s gold supply. Foreign countries, fundamentally, can only earn the dollars they need by carrying the majority of trade in their own ships, by inducing American tourists to spend a sizable amount of dollars abroad, and by exporting more commodities to the United States than they import from the United States. Since, with relatively few exceptions, foreign countries cannot compete with American manufacturers, they are reduced to exporting to the United States raw materials, minerals and farm products.
When England was confronted with a similar problem in 1847, she repealed the “Corn Laws,” permitting foreign wheat and other agricultural commodities to be imported into England without tariffs. The result was the abandonment of British agriculture, accompanied by a gigantic increase in industrial output. Perhaps, if the Farm Bloc were not so strong, American imperialism might have been able to achieve a classic solution of its crucial imperialist contradiction. It is, however, politically impossible and historically too late to solve the problem in this manner. The experience of the last few years indicates the only way in which American imperialism ran hope to continue to maintain an export level between five and ten per cent of total output, as the following data (from the June, 1951, Survey of Current Business) show.

American exports of almost $17 billion in 1948, almost $10 billion in 1949, and more than $14.4 billion in 1950 amounted to 7 per cent, 6.8 per cent, and 5.6 per cent, respectively, of net national product. This is relatively less than the ratio that “normally” prevails with the exception of years of deep depression. Its importance cannot be measured simply by reference to the absolute amounts involved. For many industries and, by and large, for the economy as a whole, the profitability of the remaining 90–95 per cent of output that is sold on the domestic market depends on maintenance of these exports. It is not only that exports make possible indispensable imports, but that surplus value is created at every stage in the process of production. Elimination of all exports, aside from certain obviously serious political and economic consequences, would not merely reduce profits of certain industries, possibly sending them into bankruptcy, but would immediately lower drastically the rate and mass of profit for all industry, and with cumulative effects.
Even though imports have been at the $10 billion level, the visible surplus in the balance of payments for commodities and services was $6.7 billion in 1948, almost $6.4 billion in 1949, and $2.3 billion in 1950. The narrowing of the gap in 1950 is due more to the rise in imports as the scramble for raw materials developed after the outbreak of the Korean war than to the fall in exports. It was more than offset, however, by the flight of gold and dollars from America as “hot” money sought the greater safety of haven in Uruguay and other places.
It is clear that American government funds have been decisive in maintaining exports. Obviously, without state foreign aid, exports would have been some four or five billion dollars less, which in turn would have had a severely depressing effect on both the American and world economies. It is equally evident that if you give the purchaser the means with which to buy what you have to sell, you can continue to do business as long as you are able to maintain your customer’s purchasing power. This is equivalent to a perpetual subsidy in the present case by the American state on the order of $5 billion annually. How long American imperialism can maintain foreign subsidies of this magnitude, now to be increased to a level of $8 billion as foreign aid shifts from predominantly economic to military commodities, is uncertain, but there is a limit and there will be a day of reckoning.
An increase of American foreign investments “from the present $1,000,000,000 a year to a minimum of $2,000,000,000 a year,” as called for by the Rockefeller report would not begin to solve the problem of the dollar gap. Moreover, as American foreign investments accumulated over the years,. assuming that any such recrudescence of traditional American imperialism was possible, the interest and dividend bill would likewise increase, and foreign countries would eventually be even shorter of dollars than at present. Let us not forget that the returns of capital invested abroad historically are much greater than the domestic rate of profit. That is one of the chief attractions of finance capital imperialism. An example of current profitability is provided by the report “that the Prince of the Kuwait Sheikdom has rejected a new offer of the Anglo-American-owned Kuwait Oil Co. to boost his oil royalties ... The offer of the company was to up the royalties from four and a half shillings to 25 shillings (63 cents to $3.50 a ton).” (World Telegram and Sun, Aug. 6, 1951.) In other words, to forestall any desire to emulate the nationalization action of Iran, the Kuwait Oil Co. is able to offer an increase of 450 per cent in the royalty paid. The Prince of Kuwait is said to have rejected this offer and to be holding out for a 50-50 split of profits!
Barring a sharp rise in privately-financed imports, which is virtually impossible, American imperialism is forced to place its main reliance in achieving practically every objective of foreign economic policy on continued state aid. Private foreign trade and investments, as in the case of domestic profits, are in effect guaranteed by the state, and the state itself must make good the failure of private investment through permanent gifts and loans.
 
IN PROMULGATING THE POINT FOUR program on Sept. 8, 1950, Truman declared:
“Communist propaganda holds that the free nations are incapable of providing a decent standard of living for the millions of people in the underdeveloped areas of the earth. The Point Four program will be one of our principal ways of demonstrating the complete falsity of that charge.”
The mountain has labored and brought forth a mouse. Thirty-four and a half million dollars was appropriated for the first year. The appropriation for the second year will be considerably less than the $500,000,000 recommended by the Gray and Rockefeller reports. Inasmuch as the Gray report was devoted to foreign economic policy as a whole, while the Rockefeller report concentrates on development, it is to the Rockefeller report that we must turn for an authoritative statement of American hopes and policies in this field.
“The people who live in what have been termed the underdeveloped areas of Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Oceania need our help and we need theirs,” states the Rockefeller report. Point Four is thus not entirely a one-sided and exclusively humanitarian venture.
“Considered from the point of view of the strategic dependence of the United States on these regions, it must be emphasized that we get from them 73 per cent of the strategic and critical materials we import – tin, tungsten, chrome, manganese, lead, zinc, copper – without which many of our most vital industries could not operate.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The major recommendation is, consequently, an expansion of Point Four:
A balanced program of economic development calls for simultaneous progress in three broad fields of economic endeavor. Along with the production of goods – which is a job for private enterprise – must go public works, such as roads, railways, harbors and irrigation works; also improvement in the basic services, like public health and sanitation, and training people in basic skills. The financing of both the public works and these basic services are largely governmental functions.
The Gray Report on United States foreign economic policy, submitted to the president last year, recommended that United States economic assistance to the underdeveloped areas be increased “up to about 500 million dollars a year for several years, apart from emergency requirements arising from military action.” The advisory board believes that the expenditure of $500,000,000 in these areas is justified. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
How an expenditure of 50 cents per person annually can have any material effect in raising living standards in the colonial areas is carefully avoided, as there is opposition within the bourgeoisie even to this pathetically small amount. Consider the following from the August 1951 Monthly Letter of the National City Bank:
“The difficulty with development is not lack of money, but such factors as lack of skills to use modern machinery, political instability, prejudice against foreigners, onerous taxation and arbitrary limits on business profits. It is doubtful if the American taxpayer should venture, through the Export-Import Bank, where neither the private capitalist nor the World Bank has dared to tread.”
Earlier, we pointed out that the Rockefeller report, like the Gray report, places its main reliance on stimulating private investment. While “a full kit of financial tools” is recommended, as usual it is the matter of lax incentives that is most revealing:
Adoption of the principle that income from business establishments located abroad be taxed only in the country where the income is earned and should therefore be wholly free of United States tax.
To avoid any drop in tax revenue during the emergency we recommend that only new investment abroad be freed of United States tax during the present emergency. As soon as the emergency is lifted the exemption should be extended to future income from investment abroad regardless of when the investment was made.
This would apply to corporations. Individuals would receive only partial exemption.
It may be anticipated that such tax concessions will not be very popular. Together, however, with the guaranties offered in the Gray report, it is clear that the bourgeoisie is desperately seeking every expedient to restore its former position. The sentiments underlying the humanitarian side of Point Four should not be minimized. They correspond to a vast yearning by the majority of the human race for emancipation from misery, starvation and exploitation. A socialist America could make real strides in helping the underdeveloped areas rapidly to overcome the backwardness imposed by centuries of feudal and imperialist exploitation. But a capitalist America can do little more than produce reports and a pittance of genuine aid.

“When we are sick we do not let nature take its course, but send for a doctor or surgeon ... As in the physical world, so in the economic world.” Thus spoke R.C. Leffingwell of J.P. Morgan & Co. in a speech reported in the New York Times of March 22, 1934, making it amply clear that the doctor in the economic world is the Federal government, i.e., the state. Not all sections of the American bourgeoisie supported state intervention as the remedy for the depression, but decisive support was forthcoming for the essential features of Roosevelt’s “Dr. New Deal.” Capitalism was seriously ill, to the point of prostration. Traditional methods of recovery, relying upon the “automatic” forces of the market had been tried and failed. Only state intervention could pump blood (profits) into the arteriosclerotic veins of a desperately sick economy.
The depression has been succeeded by the Permanent War Economy, but state intervention in the economy remains. In fact, it has increased until state monopoly capitalism provides an alternative description for the new stage of capitalism. Inasmuch as some degree of state intervention has obtained ever since the existence of national states, the nature, purposes and consequences of state intervention require somewhat detailed analysis to reveal precisely what is new in the situation.
The growing state intervention in the capitalist economy, which distinguishes it from the traditional or laissez-faire phase of capitalism, is an outgrowth of financial imperialism. This was clearly perceived by Lenin (Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism, p. 25) when he wrote:
“Capitalism in its imperialist stage arrives at the threshold of the most complete socialization of production. In spite of themselves, the capitalists are dragged, as it were, into a new social order, a transitional social order from complete free competition to complete socialization. Production becomes social, but appropriation remains private. The social means of production remain the private property of a few. The general framework of formally recognized free competition remains, but the yoke of a few monopolists on the rest of the population becomes a hundred times heavier, more burdensome and intolerable.”
The intercorporate arrangements that caused production to become social at the turn of the twentieth century have first been regularized and then controlled by the state as the twentieth century has unfolded. The preservation of “the yoke of a few monopolists” is now inconceivable without the direct and indirect support of the state, whose ubiquitous interference in daily life manifests itself in a thousand and one ways. At first, as Lenin indicates, “... state monopoly in capitalist society is nothing more than a means of increasing and guaranteeing the income of millionaires on the verge of bankruptcy in one branch of industry or another.” (Imperialism, p. 39) State intervention in the Great Depression of the 1930’s was characterized exclusively by the objective of restoring the profits of the millionaires, and in this it was largely successful.
Events have a logic of their own. The restoration of the rate of profit could not be followed by an abandonment of state intervention. On the contrary, like a patient who has recovered from an almost fatal illness solely through taking medicine containing habit-forming drugs, the enduring “health” of capitalism demands the continuation of the “habit-forming drug” of state intervention. This becomes obvious as the economy of depression is followed by the Permanent War Economy. There are differences, however. Not only is state intervention more extensive, but it is no longer confined to restoring the profitability of “sick” industries. The most decisive sections of capital are subjected to state control and direction, but the reward is the virtual guarantee of the profits of the bourgeoisie as a class.
 
THE GROWTH OF THE STATE BUREAUCRACY and the increasing consumption of surplus value by the state in the form of increasing taxes are both evidence of increasing state intervention and we shall examine the facts below. Increasing domination of the apparatus of state control by representatives of monopoly capital is an even more impressive feature of the new capitalism. Lenin, with his remarkable insight into the function of capitalism in its imperialist stage, also anticipated this development. Referring to finance capital as the “personal union” between banking and industrial capital, he states (Imperialism, p. 42): “The ‘personal union’ between the banks and industry is completed by the ‘personal union’ between both and the state.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.) And the union between finance capital and its state is of the most personal nature possible through the appointment of outstanding representatives of “big business” to positions of authority in the administration of virtually all state controls affecting production, distribution and prices – and therefore profits.
The rationalization for state intervention in the depression was provided by John Maynard Keynes, who showed why traditional wage-cutting methods could not restore effective demand and the rate of profit. According to Keynes, restoration of effective demand could not be left to private control of investment decisions. “I conclude,” says Keynes in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (p. 320), “that the duty of ordering the current volume of investment cannot safely be left in private hands.” Thus, the role of the state is a steadily increasing one: “I expect to see the State ... taking an ever greater responsibility for directly organizing investment.” (The General Theory, p. 164)
Despite certain of his critics, especially the unreconstructed advocates of laissez-faire, the purpose of state intervention in the Keynesian system is to preserve capitalism. A perfectly fair and thoroughly valid appraisal of Keynes is provided by the American Keynesian, Seymour E. Harris, in his introduction to The New Economics: Keynes’ Influence on Theory and Public Policy (p. 5):
“... it may be well to insist that Keynes was essentially a defender of capitalism. Only the stupidity of those whom he supports can account for any other interpretation. Keynes indeed offers government a larger degree of control over the economic process and a larger degree of operation than the old-fashioned classical economist; but his motive is to save capitalism, not destroy it ... Keynes wanted government to assume responsibility for demand, because otherwise the system would not survive. [My Italics – T.N.V.] It was possible to have both more  government activity and more private activity – if unemployment could only be excluded. And above all, Keynes would not remove the foundations of capitalism: free choice, the driving force of the quest for profits, the allocation of resources in response to the price incentive.”
Keynes’ own appraisal of his role accords quite closely with that of Harris. In the concluding notes to The General Theory (pp. 380–381), he writes:
“Whilst, therefore, the enlargement of the functions of government, involved in the task of adjusting to one another the propensity to consume and the inducement to invest, would seem to a nineteenth-century publicist or to a contemporary American financier to be a terrific encroachment on individualism, I defend it, on the contrary, both as the only practicable means of avoiding the destruction of existing economic forms in their entirety and as the condition of the successful functioning of individual initiative. [Italics mine – T.N.V.]
“For if effective demand is deficient, not only is the public scandal of wasted resources intolerable, but the individual enterpriser who seeks to bring these resources into action is operating with the odds loaded against him. The game of hazard which he plays is furnished with many zeros, so that the players as a whole will lose if they have the energy and hope to deal all the cards. Hitherto the increment of the world’s wealth has fallen short of the aggregate of positive individual savings; and the difference has been made up by the losses of those whose courage and initiative have not been supplemented by exceptional skill or unusual good fortune. But if effective demand is adequate, average skill and average good fortune will be enough.
“The authoritarian state systems of today seem to solve the problem of unemployment at the expense of efficiency and of freedom. It is certain that the world will not much longer tolerate the unemployment which, apart from brief intervals of excitement, is associated – and, in my opinion, inevitably associated with present-day capitalistic individualism. But it may be possible by a right analysis of the problem to cure the disease whilst preserving efficiency and freedom.” [Italics mine – T.N.V.]
The passage is remarkable, both for its typical expression of Keynes’ fundamental thesis that only state intervention can save capitalism from destroying itself through mass unemployment and, for an otherwise first-rate economist, his complete inability to understand the origin and nature of profits. Why “effective demand” periodically is “deficient” requires an insight into the inner workings of capitalism impossible to attain without such basic Marxian tools as the labor theory of value, the laws of capital accumulation and the falling average rate of profit. Of this Keynes is incapable for, with all his emancipation from the fetishism of Marshallian economics, he still attributes the ability of capital to increase its magnitude (profits) to its “scarcity.” Thus (The General Theory, p. 213), “the only reason why an asset offers a prospect of yielding during its life services having an aggregate value greater than its initial supply price is because it is scarce; and it is kept scarce because of the competition of the rate of interest on money.”
While Keynes’ “theory” of profits is, of course, sheer nonsense, it does not detract from his role as chief theoretician justifying state intervention. To quote the leading American Keynesian, Alvin H. Hansen, in an essay entitled, The General Theory, contained in Harris’ book previously cited
“David McCord Wright, in a recent article on the Future of Keynesian Economies (American Economic Review, June 1945), put his finger quite accurately on the basic change in outlook effected by the ‘Keynesian Revolution.’ We cannot follow, he says, the main lines of Keynes’ argument and say that the capitalist system, left to itself, will automatically bring forth sufficient effective demand. Keynes’ ideas ‘derive much of their unpopularity because they form the most widely known arguments for intervention even though such intervention may be quite capitalist in nature.’ It is the analysis of the problem of aggregate demand, together with the implications of this analysis for practical policy, which challenges the old orthodoxy.”
Under the Permanent War Economy, state intervention in the capitalist economy not only expands, but also takes on added functions. The problem is no longer one of buttressing effective demand to eliminate unemployment. From an economy being undermined by deflationary forces, there has occurred a complete shift to one in which inflationary forces predominate. State intervention must therefore, in the first instance, now be concerned with controlling production and prices. Demand has become too effective and must be curbed; the state must also take such measures as are necessary to allocate supplies so as to achieve the desired balance between the war and civilian sectors of the economy.
The increase in state functions, accompanied by a loss in the effectiveness of the capitalist market, has meant a colossal expansion in government expenditures, which, in turn, has necessitated a phenomenal increase in taxes. The relationship of government income to current production and surplus value from 1939 to 1950 is shown in Table I.

**From Table I of previous article in March–April issue of The New International.
† From Table VIII of previous article in March–April issue of The New International
‡ State and local government receipts and receipts of social insurance contributions are estimated. The official
figure for net national product in 1950, when released, will probably be about $2 billion higher than our estimate.



In 1939, at the beginning of the Permanent War Economy, total government receipts were $15.4 billion, with Federal government receipts two billion dollars less than State and local government receipts. Starting in 1941, Federal government receipts rise sharply, dwarfing the relatively modest increase in State and local government receipts. By 1950, while the latter had more than doubled compared with 1939, the former had increased more than six times, with the result that total government receipts had more than quadrupled.
Even after government receipts of social insurance contributions, which have virtually tripled since 1939, are subtracted from total government receipts, total government receipts of taxes of all forms, including certain fees and related payments, have increased from $13.3 billion in 1939 to an estimated $56.5 billion in 1950. In other words, the cessation of hostilities, aside from minor declines in 1946 and 1949, has not been accompanied by any diminution in the state’s appetite for surplus value. This becomes crystal clear when we examine columns seven and nine in Table I, portraying the share of government income in both total production and surplus value.
In 1939, one-sixth of current production and one-third of surplus value went to the state (all branches). This represented, so to speak, the fruits of state intervention in the depression. Under the impetus of the rapid increase in war outlays and increasing government controls, these proportions rose rapidly until in 1943 almost one-fourth of current production and nearly one-half of surplus value went to the state. In spite of steady declines from 1943 to 1949, there has been no question of restoring pre-war relationships. Even in 1949, the state consumed 21.4 per cent of current output and 38.6 per cent of surplus value. In 1950, these percentages increased to an estimated 22 and almost 40 per cent, respectively. With the present rapid increase in war outlays and Federal tax rates, it is obvious that these ratios will climb rapidly toward their wartime peaks.
 
ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE, as shown in the last article on Declining Standards of Living, that a sizable portion of taxes comes from the working classes, the bourgeoisie contribute the major share to the upkeep of the state. Hence, the loud hue and cry from the all sections of the capitalist press for “elimination of government waste.” This is quite understandable when roughly two out of every five dollars accruing to the bourgeoisie go to support its state. Admittedly, there is considerable room for numerous savings in government operations without in any way impairing the functions of the state. Yet, before we shed tears for the “plight” of the American bourgeoisie, we would do well to examine its profits position. For, despite the huge overhead cost of the capitalist state, the bourgeoisie has never been so well off financially as it is today.
Naturally, when state expenditures exceed state receipts, i.e., income derived from current production, the difference must be covered by state borrowing, representing essentially income derived from past production. The periodic rapid increase in the government debt becomes a potent source of inflationary pressure on the economy. In fact, state income and expenditures, or fiscal policy, are by far the most powerful single factor in determining the level at which the economy operates. Besides exerting great influence on the size of the national product, the nature of state fiscal policies in large measure ordains the composition of the national product among the various classes. To a significant extent, therefore, the personnel of the state bureaucracy becomes, as it were, an arena for the conduct of the class struggle. This is obviously the case where class pressures are exerted on Congress and State and local legislatures. It is equally true and, in certain cases, more so, when policy can be influenced or modified by administrative action, within the Executive branch of government. The recent attack of the United Labor Policy Committee on “big business domination of the Defense Program,” and particularly on Defense Mobilizer Charles E. Wilson is a perfect illustration of the corroding impact of the Permanent War Economy on the functioning of capitalism, as well as the inordinate power that is concentrated in the hands of a single individual who is merely an appointee.
Controlling supply and prices, to mention only the obvious, requires a far larger state bureaucracy than the relatively simple function of buttressing effective demand, which was the chief rôle of the state during the depression. The war economy also demands a permanent increase in the military bureaucracy, aside from the periodic need to assure an adequate supply of cannon fodder. As a consequence, omitting from consideration the period of World War II itself, the state’s claim on the employable labor force has increased markedly, as can be seen from Table II.

with actual 1950 substituted for estimate of 3,100,000.
† Breakdown shown in Table II-A; excludes Federal work relief employment totaling 3,216,000 in
1939, 2,792,000 in 1940, 2,192,000 in 1941, 909,000 in 1942, and 85,000 in 1943.
‡ Breakdown shown in Table II-A; excludes State and Local work relief employment totaling 29,000
in 1939, 38,000 in 1940, 17,000 in 1941, and 5,000 in 1942.



The total employed labor force, including the armed forces, has in creased from 46,120,000 in 1939 to 61,457,000 in 1950, an increase exceeding fifteen million, or approximately one-third. This is without reference to the fact that the total employed labor force reached a peak of 65,220,000 in 1944 at the height of the war. In part, this was accomplished by a sharp reduction in the amount of unemployment and, in even larger part, by absorbing new entrants into the labor force arising from the growth in population.
Meanwhile, total State and local government employment increased from 3,287,000 in 1939 to 4,000,000 in 1950 (despite a slight decline during the war) – an increase of close to 25 per cent. This, however, is less than the increase in the total employed labor force. The growth in the state bureaucracy, as is only natural, is largely accounted for by the increase in total Federal government employment, which rose from 1,286,000 in 1939 to 3,730,000 in 1950 – an increase of almost 200 per cent. Thus, total Federal government employment, which was two million less than total State and local government employment in 1939, almost equalled the latter in 1950. The result is that total government employment has increased from 4,573,000 in 1939 to 7,730,000 in 1950 – a rise of 69 per cent during the first eleven years of the Permanent War Economy.
The government employment ratio, set forth in column seven of Table II, tells the story so far as the over-all growth in the state bureaucracy and its relationship to total employment is concerned. From a ratio of less than ten per cent in 1939, meaning that only one employed person out of ten was on a government payroll, there occurred a steady rise to 12.2 per cent in 1941 and then a phenomenal increase during the war to a peak of 27.1 per cent in 1945. In other words, during the height of World War II, more than one employed person in every four was being supported by the state! Following the end of the war, there was, naturally, a rapid decline in the government employment ratio, until it reached a low of 11.9 per cent in 1948, with an increase since then to 12.6 per cent in 1950.
Again, the highly significant fact is that there is no return to the prewar relationship, even in the case of the government employment ratio. Instead of one out of ten belonging to one or another segment of the state bureaucracy, as was the case in 1939, we now have one out of every eight employed persons in this category. We have already exceeded the government ratio that prevailed in 1941 and are moving rapidly toward the relationship that existed in 1942. For the government employment ratio to increase beyond this level, approaching the fantastic heights of 1943–1945, would undoubtedly require participation by American imperialism in an all-out war effort. Nevertheless, the warnings are apparent on every hand that manpower, even more than strategic materials, will be the limiting factor in the current effort of American imperialism to contain and then to destroy Stalinist imperialism. Parenthetically, this is the decisive reason why American imperialism must seek and maintain allies, and why ‘the MacArthur policy, to the extent that it would jeopardize this fundamental strategic aim, is suicidal.
The composition of government employment, as shown in Table II-A, reveals the crucial importance of manpower and demonstrates that not even American imperialism can maintain an economy of “guns and butter, too” if we assume that all-out war is in the offing.

Let us suppose, for example, that an all-out war effort against Stalinist imperialism will compel about the same manpower utilization by the military and Federal civilian bureaucracies as took place in 1944, and that it is desired at the same time to sustain the civilian economy at current high levels. An increase of almost eleven million in Federal employment over 1950 would be needed. Even allowing for full absorption of the unemployed, and the normal increase of several hundred thousand a year in those seeking work for the first time, there would still be a shortage of between seven and eight million. Even reducing State and local government employment to the 1944 level would save less than 900,000. Thus, private civilian employment would have to be reduced by six to seven million, or an equivalent amount of married women, retired workers and others not presently considered part of the labor force would have to be induced to seek and to accept employment. In either case, the impact on civilian output, aside from any shortages in materials or productive capacity, would be substantial.
Abstracting from the war situation itself, however, there has been approximately a tripling in the size of the Federal civilian bureaucracy, which rose from 571,000 in 1939 to an estimated 1,568,000 in 1950. Even more dramatic has been the increase in the military bureaucracy, which increased from 342,000 in 1939 to an estimated 1,500,000 in 1950 – a growth of well over 300 per cent. As a permanent feature, the size of the military forces (without regard for the current build-up in connection with the Korean war) exceeds the number employed in public education. What a sad and fitting commentary on the moral bankruptcy of capitalism! Of at least passing interest is the sizable increase in the number of State and local government non-school employees, which declined from 1,877,000 in 1939 to 1,700,000 in 1944 and then rose to an estimated 2,342,000 in 1950 – representing a growth of more than 25 per cent from 1939 to 1950. Even the cost of local police and bureaucratic functions increases!
Although the figures are still relatively small, the increase in employment in government enterprises, from a combined total of 516,000 in 1939 to an estimated 863,000 in 1950, is noteworthy – not only because this is an increase of almost 70 per cent, and nearly 80 per cent for Federal government enterprises alone, but because of the steadily rising trend. The sphere of nationalized production is gradually being enlarged, and this is not just a question of the post office, but rather of public utilities and atomic energy and, to some extent, transportation. It is no longer solely a question of nationalizing those industries that are incapable of operating at a profit. A new element has been injected and it has arisen only because of the dual aims of the war economy. Private capitalists either lack the resources or cannot be entrusted with such vital war  tasks as development of synthetic rubber and atomic energy. Profitability is not the decisive consideration, but survival. The state, as the executive committee of the bourgeoisie, can do what no single capitalist or group of capitalists can do. Unlimited sums can be poured into any project which is deemed essential, whether it is profitable or not.
More than eleven per cent of government employment is currently to be found in nationalized enterprises. The process of erosion has begun, even in America, the stronghold of capitalist private property. While some of the more class-conscious capitalists are prone to question where it will all end, they are all consoled by the actuality of profits exceeding anyone’s imagination.
 
HAND IN HAND WITH THE INCREASE in taxes and the permanent growth in the state bureaucracy go an enormous increase in business and a fantastic increase in profits. This can readily be seen from an examination of the data for corporate sales, profits and taxes, shown in Table III.

Economic Advisers based on actuals for first three quarters of 1950.



We have shown the data for corporate sales, profits and taxes from 1929 to 1950, in order to demonstrate conclusively how the Permanent War Economy, with all its increasing state intervention, has paid off handsomely lor the bourgeoisie. Although corporate tax liability for the decade 1929–1938 was negligible, totaling $9.2 billion for the entire ten years, corporate profits could not reach 1929 levels by a very sizable amount. Even corporate sales remained below 1929 despite state intervention during the depression. For the first ten years of the Permanent War Economy, however, corporate sales went up by leaps and bounds, reaching a level of $381.3 billion in 1948 and by 1950 were almost three times the level of 1929! Even when allowance is made for the depreciation of the dollar, the absolute increase in physical sales is fairly impressive. At the same time, corporate taxes totalled $97.5 billion for the first decade of the Permanent War Economy – a burden ten times that of the previous decade. Nevertheless, corporate profits after taxes increased from $20.3 billion in the decade 1929–1938 to $113.5 billion in the decade 1939–1948, an increase in the mass of net profit amounting to 459 per cent!
The superiority of war and war economy over the New Deal and public works, so far as the capitalist class is concerned, is unmistakably clear. As a matter of fact, the inclusion of 1929 profits distorts our comparison of the depression era with the Permanent War Economy. Proper procedure would begin the comparison with the year 1930. For the nine-year period, 1930–1938, corporate profits after taxes equalled $11.9 billion, while corporate sales minus gross profits totalled $881.8 billion, yielding a rate of profit of 1.3 per cent. Take any nine years of the first twelve years of the Permanent War Economy, and what a difference! From 1939 to 1917, for example, corporate profits after taxes equalled $92.6 billion, while corporate sales minus gross profits totalled $1,762.3 billion, yielding a rate of profit of 5.3 per cent.
The pump primer of increasing war outlays produced a doubling of sales and, even with the gigantic increase in taxes, a 678 per cent increase in the mass of net profits and a 308 per cent increase in the rate of profit! Increasing state intervention does, after all, have some good points. The Permanent War Economy has yielded a profit bonanza that is without precedent in a highly developed capitalist nation and is almost embarrassing to the bourgeoisie. And, in complete confirmation of the trends previously developed in the rate of surplus value and relative class standards of living, the picture improves from the point of view of the bourgeoisie. A new peak of $33.9 billion before taxes and $20.9 billion after taxes was reached by American corporations in 1948. Even the slight decline of 1949 left profits above the already swollen wartime levels. It remained, however, for 1950, aided in no small measure by the outbreak of the Korean war, to reach new historic profits and sales peaks. For the first time in history, corporate sales exceeded $400 billion. Corporate profits before taxes are estimated at $39.8 billion, with corporate profits after taxes likewise reaching a new high of $22.1 billion. Compare these figures with the increase in wages, even after allowance for rising personal income taxes, and it is clear that state intervention under the Permanent War Economy has restored both the mass and rate of profit. Capitalism has revived, at least so far as the bourgeoisie are concerned. If only it can be sustained indefinitely, ponder the theoreticians of the bourgeoisie!
Despite the “inventory recession” of the first half of 1951, the heavy industries, the “war babies,” are not worried. “Current profits in some industries continue to be terrific,” states Carlton A. Shively, stock market commentator of the New York World-Telegram and Sun, in his column of May 1, 1951.
“That is true of oil, copper, steel, motor, rubber and the and chemical industries. Many units in those industries are reporting for first quarter far higher net profits as compared with the same quarter of last year, and the net profits as compared with fourth quarter, even after excess profits taxes, show little or no decline. Without the excess profits taxes the net profits for many corporations would be so large they would cause anxiety on many counts.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
There can be no doubt that the wasting of resources, both human and natural, in war and preparation for war is a profitable business (so far) for the American bourgeoisie. The manner in which the war economy is run, with negotiated contracts (between big business and its own representatives in the government) and huge tax concessions through rapid amortization, means that profits are, in effect, guaranteed by the state. How the bourgeoisie and their apologists have the effrontery to complain about those unions that have cost-of-living escalator clauses in their contracts is virtually beyond comprehension. Yet, it is only when we examine what has happened to the rate of corporate profit that the real skullduggery of the bourgeoisie and the immense profitability of the Permanent War Economy become apparent.
 
RATES ARE FAR MORE SUSCEPTIBLE OF juggling than absolute figures, although we can be reasonably certain that the mass of corporate profit has not been overstated. What this mass of profit is divided by determines the rate of profit. Four different methods of computing the “rate of corporate profit” are shown in Table IV.

*Derived from Table III, with the exception of the NAM concept of the
rate of profit.
†From Profits and Prices, Economic Policy Division Series No. 31,
October 1950, published by Research Department of NAM. Net profits
after taxes are adjusted for changes in inventory valuation, as estimated
by Department of Commerce as due to changes in price level.
‡Estimated.



There is first the concept of the National Association of Manufacturers, the super trade association of certain segments of the big bourgeoisie. Not content with computing the rate of profit on sales, the NAM adjusts net profits after taxes for changes in inventory valuation, on the theory that increases in inventory due to price changes are fortuitous and really not part of the profits of the bourgeoisie, especially when prices are going up. This approach is rationalized by emphasizing that low-cost inventory must be replaced at current high costs. Which is well and good, but the corporation that stocked inventory at relatively low costs still obtains a windfall profit, on which it has to pay income taxes, whether a compensating future loss is anticipated or not. And in an inflationary period, inventory losses due to price declines are not very likely.
A more important fallacy in the NAM method of computing the rate of profit is that when the mass of profit is divided by sales, the effect is to count profit itself as a cost of production. This is necessarily so since the sales price includes the profit. Despite widespread profiteering and cries that the Office of Price Stabilization is attempting to control prices through control of profits, profits are a result and not a cost of production. To treat profits as a cost of production is equivalent of demanding a perpetual pyramiding of profits, for the larger the profit the larger the increase in profit that is required to maintain the former rate of profit. Nevertheless, even the NAM figures cannot conceal the fact that the Permanent War Economy has done a pretty good job of restoring the rate of profit. Still, a rate of four or five per cent is less than the 6.4 per cent of 1929 and sounds sufficiently small to be inconsequential in its effect. The prevalence of figures, especially in press releases, calculating the rate of profit on sales is a tribute to the propaganda of the bourgeoisie and to its ability to promote its own self-interests, but is hardly conducive to scientific accuracy.
The mass of profit must therefore be divided by sales minus profit in order to begin to arrive at the rate of profit. This is done, without any changes for inventory valuation, in both the middle columns of Table IV. In both cases, the mass of profit is measured as the net profit after taxes. In the first case, however, corporate sales minus net profits are used as the denominator; in the second case, corporate sales minus gross profits are taken as the proper base on which to calculate the rate of profit. A rate of profit of six per cent is almost equal to the performance of 1929, and considerably better than the five per cent or less shown by the NAM. The difference, percentagewise, is substantial, especially if we take the figures for 1950, which we have already shown is the peak profit year in the history of American capitalism. The NAM approach yields a rate of profit of but 4.4 per cent. Under our first method, we obtain a rate of corporate profit of 5.7 per cent, which is almost 30 per cent higher than the NAM would show. Under our alternative method, the rate of profit becomes six per cent, which is more than 36 per cent higher than the NAM’s figure!
The difference between our two methods, of course, is that in the former taxes are, in effect, treated as a cost of production, while in the latter the base on which profits are calculated is without reference to taxes. A moment’s reflection will show that it is no more proper to consider taxes as a cost of production than profits. It is true that one of the great weaknesses of the present corporate tax structure is that most corporations are able to pass on higher taxes in the form of higher prices, thereby contributing to the inflation and maintaining the same mass of profit and, in some cases, the same rate of profit as existed before any given increase in corporation taxes. This, again, is hardly a justification for treating a result of production, for taxes (on corporations) are merely taking a portion of profit or surplus value, as a cost of production.
Arriving at a true official rate of corporate profit therefore requires subtraction of both profits and taxes from sales before the rate of profit is computed. The rate of profit, in terms of obtaining a true picture of what is actually happening in the economy, therefore ought to be calculated before taxes, both with reference to the mass of profit and to volume of capital employed to obtain a given profit. This is done in the last column of Table IV. The picture that emerges is considerably different from any previously discussed. Since 1941 the rate of corporate profit has exceeded 1929! For the war years and for 1950, the rate of profit runs in the neighborhood of eleven to twelve per cent – a level about 50 per cent higher than in 1929. The rate of profit in actuality is thus two and almost three times the modest picture shown by the NAM. That the bourgeoisie have had to disgorge half or almost half of their profits to their own state for the conduct of their war and preparations for their future war has precisely nothing to do with the degree to which the working classes are exploited in the process of production.
 
IT IS ONLY THE RATE OF PROFIT before taxes that gives us an inkling of what a life-saver the Permanent War Economy has been to the bourgeoisie. Even this is far from the whole picture, for the simple reason that profits are only one form of surplus value. The capitalist who makes profits must share his cut of surplus values created by the workers with the capitalist who obtains interest, with those who obtain rent and royalties, with those whom he pays huge salaries to manage his wealth, and with the state which demands taxes to protect him and his system. The true rate of profit for all industry can thus be obtained only by dividing the mass of surplus value by the total amount of capital, both constant and variable, employed in production.
To arrive at meaningful figures for the Marxian formula for the rate of profit, s divided by (c plus v), is not easy, but it can be approximated through the following technique. Having already derived the mass of surplus value in the last article, together with the mass of variable capital, it is only necessary to obtain the magnitude of constant capital. We know of no method whereby this can be done directly, as there would be far too many gaps in building up the total mass of constant capital on an industry-by-industry basis. Even if reliable and comprehensive capital investment figures could be obtained, we would still lack information on the turnover of capital – a factor of critical importance in developing the rate of profit.
Accordingly, it is necessary to start with sales data, and to try to build up total sales or receipts for all industry. Inasmuch as the market price of a commodity represents its value, the proceeds from sales necessarily embody the values transferred by the employment of constant capital in production and the values created by the employment of variable capital or labor power in production. This approach conceptually yields a true gross national product for all industry. It may be objected that in many industries the market price of a commodity deviates from both its production price and value. This is of no consequence for we are seeking the rate of profit for all industry. The deviations of market price from value must cancel out; otherwise, there would be no profit or surplus value for the capitalist class as a whole. This, incidentally, is the pitfall on which all non-Marxian theories of profit collapse, for on top of their faulty theoretical approach they are immersed in the analysis of the single entrepreneur or firm. While marginal utility, scarcity, speculation, or risk-taking may on occasion explain the fortuitous profits of an individual firm, such theories cannot begin to explain how it is possible for the entire capitalist class to start with a given quantity of capital and to emerge from the process of production and circulation with an amount of capital exceeding the starting sum by a definite and measurable increment.
The data on corporate sales are readily available and were presented in Table III. Our problem therefore resolves itself into one of estimating the sales or receipts of unincorporated enterprises. Here we can begin with a Commerce series on “Total Business Sales,” which covers only retail and wholesale trade and manufacturing. These data, with a breakdown shown between corporate and noncorporate sales, are presented in Table V.

*Represents what Commerce terms “Total Business Sales” – “the sum of data for manufacturing and
wholesale and retail trade. These figures are smaller than the non-farm business statistics used in
gross national product computations by the amount of sales ... for construction, utilities and other
non-industrial sectors.”
†Includes automobile services.
‡Corporate retail, wholesale and manufacturing sales estimated on the assumption that they increased by
 the same proportion over 1949 as total corporate sales, with non-corporate sales derived as a residual.



The data themselves are of more than passing interest. As one would expect, unincorporated enterprises play only a negligible role in the volume of manufacturing sales, but are fairly significant in wholesale trade, accounting for thirty per cent or thereabouts of total volume. In retail trade, however, noncorporate sales are as important as corporate sales, actually accounting for more than half of total retail sales in every year under consideration except 1950. In other words, it is primarily in retail trade that the bulk of the middle classes exists, a testimonial to the survival qualities of the corner grocery store and gasoline station.
The most interesting fact about these figures is the tendency for the importance of manufacturing to increase as war outlays (and controls) increase. Thus, while total manufacturing sales were less than the combined total of retail and wholesale trade sales in 1939, accounting for 46 per cent of total business sales, they increased steadily as war outlays and controls gathered momentum, reaching a peak of 57 per cent of total business sales in 1943 and 1944. Then, there was a rapid decline until in 1946 the prewar rate of 46 per cent prevailed again. The basic tendency for wasteful distribution to diminish in importance, and for manufacturers to sell directly to the government as well as to exert a squeeze on middlemen, reasserted itself following 1946, with the result that in 1950 manufacturing: sales were 49 per cent of total business sales.
In a small way, these trends are corroborative evidence of the loss of effectiveness of the capitalist market as an allocator of resources. Looked at another way, while total wholesale trade sales increased 232 per cent from 1939 to 1950, and total retail trade sales augmented by 234 per cent during the same period, total manufacturing sales grew by 284 per cent. This is merely another way of saying that under the Permanent War Economy, aside from periods of all-out war, when the increase is even more striking, manufacturing has grown at a rate 20 per cent faster than distribution. The propensity of capitalism to dig its own grave through increasing industrialization and greater proletarianization of the labor force is thus strengthened under the Permanent War Economy.
To noncorporate sales for manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, it was necessary to add sales or receipts for the remainder of unincorporated business activity, such as gross farm income, unincorporated construction activity, and the like. While there may be some duplication in the figures, and even some omissions, the gross figure for unincorporated business shown in column two of Table VI appears to be reasonable both as to level and trend.

*From Table III, column one.
†To non-corporate retail, wholesale and manufacturing sales, shown in Table V, were added
gross farm income, non-corporate and government construction activity; national income
originating in finance, insurance and real estate, services, and government and government
enterprises, and a miscellaneous factor based on the number of active proprietorsin agricul-
tural services, forestry and fisheries, mining, transportation, and communications and public
utilities.
** Derived by subtracting net national product, shown in column six of Table I, from column
 three.
‡ From Table VIII of previous article in March–April 1951 issue of The New International.
 



Constant capital was derived, as explained in the footnote to column four, by subtracting net national product (which represents the sum of variable capital and surplus value) from the gross value of production. An alternative method, since the magnitude of variable capital and surplus value were previously derived, would have been to subtract surplus value from the gross value of production, thereby obtaining total capital, i.e., the summation of constant and variable capital. Then, from this last figure, variable capital could have been subtracted in order to obtain constant capital. The results would naturally be identical.
It is the relationship between the magnitude of surplus value and the magnitude of total capital that determines the rate of profit, according to Marx, and for all industry, including the portions of surplus value paid out in the form of interest, rent, etc., in addition to that which is specifically labeled profits, he is unquestionably correct. The average rate of profit, shown in column eight of Table VI, thus portrays the actual performance of American capitalism under the Permanent War Economy.
Three facts of considerable importance emerge from this analysis of the average rate of profit:

The level of the average rate of profit is almost three times that shown in Table IV, confirming the easily observed fact that the capitalist who obtains profit must pay substantial tribute to the more parasitic members of the capitalist class who collect interest, rent, royalties, and absurdly large salaries (of course, in many cases, the division among capitalists as to the form and method of appropriating surplus value is not nearly as clear-cut as herein suggested).
 
The Permanent War Economy not only succeeded in restoring the profitability of American capitalism, but actually managed to increase the average rate of profit until 1944, i.e., there is a definite correlation between the ratio of war outlays to total output and the average rate of profit. An increase of 30 per cent in the average rate of profit, as occurred between 1939 and 1944–1945 is, in some ways, even more significant than the fact that the true average rate of profit for all industry reached a peak of one-third, for it is conclusive evidence that state intervention has as its major objective guaranteeing the profits of the bourgeoisie.
 
The Marxian law of the falling average rate of profit reasserts itself following the end of World War II, although it is significant that the maintenance of a ten per cent ratio of war outlays to total output is sufficient, in the short run at any rate, to maintain the average rate of profit at a higher level than existed in 1939 or even in 1940.

The data contained in Table VI represent the “guts” of the economic performance of American capitalism under the Permanent War Economy. From 1939 to 1950, the mass of surplus value rose from almost $40 billion to an estimated $142 billion, a rise of 256 per cent, the largest increase of any of the components of economic performance. Virtually keeping pace was the increase in the magnitude of constant capital, which rose from $112.3 billion in 1939 to an estimated $396.8 billion in 1950, a rise of 253 per cent. The gross value of total output, as measured by gross sales or receipts, naturally comes next in rate of growth, increasing from $195.5 billion in 1939 to an estimated $653.8 billion in 1950, a rise of 234 per cent. Then follows total capital, which rose from $155.6 billion in 1939 to an estimated $511.8 billion in 1950, a rise of 229 per cent. In last place is the increase in the magnitude of variable capital, which rose from $43.3 billion in 1939 to an estimated $115 billion in 1950, a rise of but 166 per cent. All of these changes combine to yield an increase over the first twelve years of the Permanent War Economy of eight per cent in the rate of profit.
In the process of capital accumulation, it is, however, as Marx observes, “the composition of the total social capital of a country” that is crucial in understanding the economic laws of motion that prevail. The organic composition of capital relates the growth in constant capital to total capital, and it is the increasingly high organic composition of capital, as constant capital increases relative to variable capital, that threatens capitalists with self-destruction through concentration and centralization of the social means of production in fewer and fewer private hands and all the social consequences that then unfold. The trend in the organic composition of capital under the Permanent War Economy can easily be calculated from the data in Table VI, and we present below the rates for the years of significant change:



Year

68.0




1946


74.8




1948


77.6




1949


76.6




1950


77.5



The mass of the means of production were thus 72.2 per cent of the total capital, including labor power, employed in production in 1939. The percentage rose slightly, in conformity with the generally observed tendency toward an increasingly high organic composition of capital, to 73.7 per cent in 1941. There then followed a perceptible decrease, during American participation in World War II, to a nadir of 68 per cent in 1944. A slight increase in 1945 was followed by a substantial increase in the composition of capital in 1946, as peacetime output resumed, with the upward trend continuing until a new peak of 77.6 per cent was attained in 1948. A slight slump during the recession of 1949 was only preliminary to virtual restoration of the 1948 peak in 1950. The organic composition of capital has thus increased by more than seven per mitt between 1939 and 1950, and by 14 per cent from 1944 to 1950.
The decline in the organic composition of capital during the war years is not surprising in view of the huge increase in the ratio of war outlays to total output, for it can be directly traced to the decline in the productivity of labor that takes place in war-time, to the physical necessity of increasing output through abnormal reliance on manpower, to the drastic decline in net private capital formation, and to the vicissitudes of the class struggle that placed the proletariat in a position to accomplish a slight reduction in the rate of surplus value. As a matter of fact, all these factors operated in the United States from 1942–1945; the only wonder is that the decline in the organic composition of capital during World War II was not greater.
Since, at an 80 per cent composition of capital, four dollars of means of production are needed to yield a wage of one dollar to the average worker, the relative diminution in the variable constituent of capital as capital accumulates makes it increasingly difficult under capitalism to employ the entire available labor force. This pressure continues to exert itself even though the Permanent War Economy has, in its own way, as previously explained, “solved” the problem of unemployment. Precisely where the breaking point is likely to be, no one can say, but it is clear that the composition of capital is already dangerously high and constitutes a sword of Damocles, hanging over the unsuspecting head of such a highly-geared capitalist economy that in a few years it is possible to produce all the automobiles, television sets, etc., that can be sold under capitalist conditions of production. If, therefore, only a very high ratio of war outlays to total output can reduce the composition of capital or, at least, arrest the tendency toward a constantly increasing composition of capital, then the economic motives for American imperialism to engage in such activities in foreign policy as warrant an increase in war outlays, even if the ultimate consequence is all-out war, are laid bare for all those with eyes to see who wish to see.
 
IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO RELY ON OUR calculations and derived figures to conclude that the Permanent War Economy has yielded an unprecedented profit bonanza for the bourgeoisie, restoring both the mass and rate of profit to record-breaking levels. We can first look at the results of a study by the Securities and Exchange Commission for manufacturing corporations listed on the stock exchange. This study, covering the years 1938 to 1947, is indicative of what has happened to the largest aggregates of capital. Its results are embodied in Table VII.

*Securities and Exchange Commission Survey Series Release No. 151, published April
27,1949, covers manufacturing corporations listed on the stock exchange, with the number
of companies varying from 1,013 in 1938 to 1,306 in 1947.
†Net worth is calculated as of the beginning of the year.



It will be seen that the rate of profit on sales is consistent with the ratios that we developed earlier in this article. Net profit before income taxes for these leading manufacturing corporations was only $1.6 billion in 1938, with net profit after taxes $1.3 billion. A spectacular rise until 1944 then took place, followed by a decline in 1945 and in 1946, and then the reaching of new heights in net profits before taxes in 1947. At more than $10 billion in  1945, these 1,306 manufacturing corporations averaged a net profit before income taxes in excess of $7.7 million, which was about four times the level of 1939. Even after income taxes, these, principal manufacturing corporations earned $6.4 billion in 1947, or almost five million dollars on the average. Despite the rise in corporation income taxes, this was three times the level of 1939! The return on net worth, which represents invested and reinvested capital, is by far the most interesting set of figures in the table as, without reference to the turnover of capital, the return on net worth indicates the expansive qualities of capital. On a before-income-tax basis, the rate of return on net worth rose from 6.4 per cent in 1938 and 10.2 per cent in 1939 to a wartime peak of 27.9 per cent in 1943 and then declined to 17.6 per cent in 1946, but immediately rose again to 27.4 per cent in 1947. The confirmation of our earlier conclusions is readily apparent.
The rate of return of net profits after income taxes on net worth is the final proof that our contentions are completely accurate with respect to the impact of the Permanent War Economy on profits. From a rate of 5.1 per cent in 1938 and 8.3 per cent in 1939, the return on investments in major manufacturing corporations rose to 12 per cent in 1941, then leveled off during the war at a rate between 9.6 and 10.1 per cent, rose to 11.9 per cent in 1946 and jumped to 17.2 per cent in 1947! At the 1947 rate of return, assuming maintenance of the tax rates in existence at that time, a capitalist would receive back his entire investment in a manufacturing enterprise in less than six years. To match a performance of this kind one must return to the earlier days of capitalism when it was in its ascendancy. Such a rate of return, almost twenty years after American capitalism entered the permanent crisis of world capitalism, is a tribute not only to the effectiveness of the Permanent War Economy in preserving capitalism, but also to the enormous inner strength and productive capacity of American capitalism.
Unfortunately, the SEC study does not go beyond 1947. We can, however, turn to the annual study of National City Bank of New York to obtain a reliable picture of current profits of leading corporations. To facilitate examination, we have divided the data contained in the National City Bank’s Monthly Letter of April 1951 into two tables. In Table VIII-A, we present the data comparing profits after taxes and book net assets (net worth) in 1950 with 1949.

AS MEMORANDA ITEMS, WE HAVE selected the four manufacturing industries that show the greatest net profit after taxes. These are the pillars of heavy industry. Their performance in 1949 is clearly comparable to 1947 (and 1948 was even a better profits year than 1947 or 1949), but in 1950 it is breathtaking. Forty-five petroleum companies increased their net profits after taxes from $1,413,000,000 in 1949 to $1,730,000,000 in 1950, an increase of 22 per cent. Fifty-five iron and steel corporations increased their net profits after taxes from $555,000,000 in 1949 to $786,000,000 in 1950, an increase of 41 per cent. Sixty-five chemical concerns increased their net profits after taxes from $543,000,000 in 1949 to $743,000,000 in 1950, an increase of 37 per cent. Twenty-six automobile companies increased their net profits after taxes from $857,000,000 in 1949 to $1,054,000,000 in 1950, an increase of 23 per cent.
For 1,693 leading manufacturing corporations, net profits after taxes increased from $7,046,000,000 in 1949 to $9,288,000,000 in 1952, an increase of 32 per cent. No wonder, then, that a special joint study of the SEC and Federal Trade Commission (summarized in The New York Times of April 27, 1951) reports that:
“Profits of manufacturing corporations touched the highest point in history during 1950 ... The report disclosed that the 1950 net income of the corporations before payment of Federal taxes was 61 per cent higher than in 1949, or $23,200,000,000, compared with 1949’s total of $14,400,000,000. Net income after taxes of manufacturing corporations in 1950 was estimated at about $12,00,000,000, or 43 per cent more than in 1949.”
The study shows that this phenomenal profit performance occurred despite an increase of almost 100 per cent in provision for Federal taxes.
The joint study also shows that the larger the assets, the smaller the rate of increase in net profits after taxes, again confirming the Marxian analysis of the results of capital accumulation. Those companies “with assets of $750,000 or less allowed an average profit increase in 1950 over 1949 of 106 per cent.” At the other end of the scale, “those of $100,000,000 and over averaged 32 per cent (increase in net profits after taxes in 1950 compared with 1949).” The previous record year of 1948 was exceeded by 11 per cent. Returning to the National City Bank study, the percentage increase in net income after taxes in 1950 over 1949 for leading corporations ranges all the way from eight per cent for 695 finance companies to 73 per cent for 248 firms engaged in transportation. Thus, for the grand total of 3,304 companies included in the study, net profits after taxes rose from $10,468,000,000 in 1949 to $13,563,000,000 in 1950, an increase of 30 per cent. The book net assets of these same corporations rose from $95.4 billion in 1949 to $101.9 billion in 1950, with manufacturing representing about half the number of companies and an equivalent portion of total capital investment.
The rate of profit for these same companies in the National City Bank Study is shown in Table VIII-B.

*National City Bank of New York, Monthly Letter, April 1951.
†Net assets at beginning of each year are based upon the excess of total balance
sheet assets over liabilities; the amounts at which assets are carried on the books
are far below present-day values, thereby implying an abnormally high return on
net worth.



Impressive as is the percentage margin on sales, even more spectacular is the return on net assets. While the performance for leading manufacturing corporations as a whole confirms the results of the SEC study previously cited in Table VII, with an increase in return on net assets from 13.9 per cent in 1949 to 17.1 per cent in 1950, it is interesting to note that the 65 chemical companies increased their return on net assets from 17.1 to 21.3 per cent, and the 26 auto and truck companies went from 30.2 to 32.3 per cent. Thus, for a corporation like General Motors, the most terrific profit-maker in the history of American capitalism, invested capital is paid for every three yearsl
In every category except finance the return on net assets rose from 1949 to 1950, with the grand total for the entire 3,304 leading corporations rising from 11.0 per cent to 13.3 per cent, which is an increase of over 20 per cent in the rate of return, despite an increase of $6.5 billion in net assets.
On the assumption that all capital invested and reinvested is employed in production, the comparison between the return on sales with the return on net assets indicates the turnover of capital and its different rates among major industries. “The shorter the period of turnover,” says Marx (Capital, Vol. III, Kerr ed., p. 85), “the smaller is the fallow portion of capital as compared with the whole, and the larger will be the appropriated surplus value, other conditions remaining the same.” Although it would be preferable to obtain the rate of turnover on capital by dividing total sales by total invested capital, the same result can be obtained by dividing the percentage return on net assets by percentage margin on sales. Inasmuch as the difference between capital turnover in 1950 and in 1949 is negligible, we present below merely the turnover times for major industrial categories, based on Table VIII-B, in 1950:

Trade (retail and wholesale)


3.9

Public Utilities

In other words, for the companies contained in the National City Bank study as a whole, capital was turned over 1.7 times in 1950, or about every seven months. The variation among industrial groups is extreme, ranging all the way from the slow turnover time of 0.7 in such heavy fixed capital industries as transportation and public utilities to the very rapid turnover of 3.9 in retail and wholesale trade, where a tremendous volume of business can be done with a relatively small capital investment as capital turns over once in almost every three months. This, of course, is another reason why calculating the rate of profit solely with reference to sales is completely misleading. For total manufacturing, the turnover is 2.2, but for autos and trucks the turnover time is 3.6, indicating why the automobile industry is so profitable.
 
THE BOURGEOISIE AS A CLASS recognizes, although with considerable reluctance, that government planning and state intervention and compulsory controls are necessary as a matter of survival if the aims of the Permanent War Economy are to be fulfilled. As Truman stated in the President’s Economic Message to Congress of January 12, 1951:
“A defense emergency requires far more planning than is customary or desirable in normal peacetime. The military build-up is a planned effort. The mobilization of industrial support for this military build-up is a planned effort. The industrial cutbacks and civilian restraints, necessary to achieve military and economic mobilization, are planned efforts ... In these critical times, it is recognized that Government must assume leadership in this planning. It has the prime responsibility for national security. It has access to the basic information. The most important operation toward this end is the broad programming of various major requirements; the balancing of these requirements against supply; and the development of policies to satisfy needs according to priority of purpose.”
These are the functions that under capitalist theory are normally reserved for prices and the market economy. That the market increasingly atrophies as a regulator of production or allocator of resources compelling increasing state intervention is the most distinctive change in the modus operandi of capitalism as the war economy develops. The question logically arises: why cannot voluntary controls work? Charles E. Wilson, defense mobilization director, gave a brief and direct answer to this question in a speech reported in The New York Times of January 18, 1951:
“What about our economy in the face of such expansion, such expenditures, such use of materials? How do we keep it from running away? There is only one answer – controls. I hate the word – so do you. But there is no other way. Voluntary methods will not work. That has been proven.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
In other words, experience has shown that appeals to loyalty, patriotism, etc., are no substitute for the state power of coercion. Practical experience has thus gone a long way toward reconciling the bourgeoisie to increasing state intervention, especially when the ratio of war outlays to total production exceeds ten per cent. As that arch exponent of laissez-faire capitalism, Ludwig von Mises, expresses the alternative (Economic Planning, 1945, p. 13): “If the market is not allowed to steer the whole economic apparatus, the government must do it.” To be sure, von Mises argues that even in wartime, if the “right methods” are used, controls are unnecessary (Bureaucracy, 1944, pp. 30–31):
It has been objected that the market system is at any rate quite inappropriate under the conditions brought, about by a great war. If the market mechanism were to be left alone, it would be impossible for the government to get all the equipment needed. The scarce factors of production required for the production of armaments would be wasted for civilian uses which, in a war, are to be considered as less important, even as luxury and waste. Thus it was imperative to resort to the system of government-established priorities and to create the necessary bureaucratic apparatus.
The error of this reasoning is that it does not realize that the necessity for giving the government full power to determine for what kinds of production the various raw materials should be used is not an outcome of the war but of the methods applied in financing the war expenditure.
If the whole amount of money needed for the conduct of the war had been collected by taxes and by borrowing from the public, everybody would have been forced to restrict his consumption drastically. With a money income (after taxes) much lower than before, the consumers would have stopped buying many goods they used to buy before the war. The manufacturers, precisely because they are driven by the profit motive, would have discontinued producing such civilian goods and would have shifted to the production of those goods which the government, now by virtue of the inflow of taxes the biggest buyer oh the market, would be ready to buy.
However, a great part of the war expenditure is financed by an increase of currency in circulation and by borrowing from the commercial banks. On the other hand, under price control, it is illegal to raise commodity prices. With higher money incomes and with unchanged commodity prices people would not only not have restricted but have increased their buying of goods for their own consumption. To avoid this, it was necessary to take recourse to rationing and to government-imposed priorities. These measures were needed because previous government interference that paralyzed the operation of the market resulted in paradoxical and highly unsatisfactory conditions. Not the insufficiency of the market mechanism but the inadequacy of previous government meddling with market phenomena made the priority system unavoidable. In this as in many other instances the bureaucrats see in the failure of their preceding measures a proof that further inroads into the market system are necessary.
We may not be pardoned for reproducing at length the views of one of the last living theoreticians of nineteenth century capitalism, but his views are unique and the subject is important. Among the factors that von Mises conveniently overlooks are the political impossibility of curtailing consumption so drastically by reliance on fiscal policy alone, the fact that government competition with private industry for scarce materials would accelerate the inflation that is inevitable once a sizable portion of production is devoted to war purposes, that confiscatory taxation (probably including a capital levy) undermining the very foundations of capitalism would be required, that Draconian fiscal controls are themselves inconsistent with the “automatic” theory of the market and would undoubtedly require implementation through forced savings and direct exercise of the police power of the state to ensure compliance, and that even if it were prudent for the bourgeoisie to ignore the lessons of history and accept the advice of von Mises, the time required to enable the state to direct production through indirect controls would unquestionably be fatal.
 
THE TIME ELEMENT, ESPECIALLY, IS recognized by the authors of the only comprehensive analysis of production controls in the war economy (Wartime Production Controls by David Novick, Melvin Anshen and W.C. Truppner, Columbia University Press, 1949, p. 16):
In peace the major influence upon economic activity is profit. The ultimate measure of the desirability of undertaking certain industrial activities or carrying them out in certain ways is the anticipated effect of the final result on the individual enterprise’s profit and loss statement. Since the peacetime economy is made up of a multitude of individual enterprises, it is important to each one, but not to the nation, whether its particular choice of policy or method is profitable or not. The classic justification for non-interference by government in business is that the accidents of individual choice result in the greatest possible production from the national resources. In time of war, however, the nation cannot wait for each of these individual experiments to produce the desired result. An over-all control of economic activity must be substituted for individual planning under the profit motive. And not only must the control agency make the industrial decisions; it must do its job without either the profit and loss test of the wisdom of its policies and the efficiency of its methods, or the time required to apply any other test. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
In other words, when it is a question of survival, neither price nor profit can guide the allocation of resources. Nor, for that matter, can the state as a general rule be expected to operate in response to such motives. After flirting with the reasons for this fact for three pages, the authors finally come sufficiently close to hitting the nail on the head (p. 18): “Because the effect of price is random and non-selective, in time of war price manipulation cannot be used as the major tool for directing the use of the nation’s resources.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.) It therefore follows that: “As the volume of military requirements increases, the area of control must grow. Ultimately, in the total war economy there must be total industrial control.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Not only is controlling production for specific objectives through the price mechanism like scattering seeds tp the four winds to plant a kernel of wheat in a particular spot, but it places the various sections of the capitalist class in an untenable position with respect to their fellow capitalist competitors. As Novick et al. put it, citing the experience of 1942, pp. 67–68:
“Caught in the competitive forces of the free market, no single producer of refrigerators or passenger automobiles could contemplate closing his doors in the face of eager crowds of customers (and endangering the continuance of his carefully nurtured distributor organization) in order to prepare his production lines to make machine guns, tanks, guns, and airplane subassemblies. Such decisions could be made only on an industry-wide basis, and this could be brought about swiftly only through government direction.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Moreover, in many cases, as previously mentioned, it would be impossible to induce the desired capital investment solely by appealing to the profit instincts of individual capitalists. As a matter of record, the Federal government financed in the neighborhood of $35 billion of industrial, military and housing facilities during World War II. Almost half of this total was for the creation of new manufacturing facilities, the vast majority of which private capital could not have undertaken even if it possessed the necessary accumulations of capital for the simple reason that, without substantial state aid, the prospects of profits would be far too remote. To be sure, many of these facilities were subsequently sold to private capital at a fraction of their cost, so that those whose products had peacetime uses could be operated by private industry at a profit. Nevertheless, the fact remains that exclusive reliance on the immediate profit motive to direct investment into desired channels during a major war (and even during a minor war as at present) would markedly reduce the military effectiveness of any industrialized nation.
The preeminent role played by state capital accumulations during World War II occurred, it must be emphasized, despite the huge aggregations of private capital that existed and which received the overwhelming portion of war contracts.
“Analysis ... indicated that in the third quarter of 1942 the 100 largest company consumers of each basic metal used the following percentages of the metal consumed by all manufacturing companies: carbon steel, 49 per cent; alloy steel, 70 per cent; copper, 79 per cent; copper-base alloy, 66 per cent; and aluminum, 81 per cent. A combined listing (eliminating duplications) yielded a total of 391 different companies (approximately 2,000 plants). In the third quarter of 1942 these 391 companies used 56 per cent of the carbon steel consumed by all manufacturing companies; 75 per cent of the alloy steel; 82 per cent of copper; 71 per cent of copper-base alloy; and 85 per cent of aluminum ... The same 391 companies shipped more than three-fourths of the total dollar value of all direct military-type products.” (Wartime Production Controls, p. 346.)
 
ASIDE FROM THE PROBLEM OF PRODUCTION, which requires direct state controls, such as priorities, allocations and the over-riding directive power of the state, the state, representing the interests of the bourgeoisie as a whole, must try to keep the inflation within tolerable limits. Naturally, inflation is so managed as to place the main burden on the backs of the working classes and many individual capitalists amass huge and quick profits. Still, an unbridled inflation can interfere with production and disrupt the plans of the military and civilian state bureaucracies. Accordingly, state intervention is extended wherever necessary, without any objections from contemporary American financiers, further circumscribing the area within which private capital is permitted by its own state to function. An excellent example is the recent decision to make the government the sole importer of rubber and tin. As Wilson’s first quarterly report states (The New York Times, April 2, 1951):
“By designating Government agencies to act as exclusive importers of commodities, such as rubber and tin, and by working in international commodity committees to allocate scarce materials among free countries, we are helping to end the current scramble for these materials which has forced their prices unnecessarily high.”
The international aspects of the Permanent War Economy are yet another reason why increasing state intervention is mandatory for the American bourgeoisie as a matter of self-preservation, but we must leave to another article treatment of its implications.
We shall also leave for subsequent analysis consideration of the implications of the various techniques used to try to “freeze” the class struggle and of the increasingly obvious Bonapartist tendencies that may be discerned as a result of what amounts to an “interlocking directorate” between the military bureaucracy and big business.
The virtual guarantee of profits by the state is the sine qua non of increasing state intervention under the Permanent War Economy. The scandals in the letting of war contracts never seem to deter repetition of the most unsavory performances of the past, even when the cast of characters is changed. “By far the most important lesson,” state the authors of Wartime Production Controls (p. 382), “is that the power to contract is the power to control.”
While the very mechanism of price control, based on perpetuating a rate of profit representing an all-time modern historical peak, is balm for the wounds of the more individualistically-minded members of the bourgeoisie, at least the larger ones, the forces that constantly work toward a transformation of traditional capitalism proceed with a logic of their own. The Office of Price Stabilization issues various types of “mark-up” regulations that result in the fixing of price ceilings at levels guaranteed to maintain super-profits, but along comes its boss, Eric Johnston, Economic Stabilization Administrator, to announce (April 21, 1945) that “no industry will be permitted to raise prices if its dollar profits amount to 85 per cent of the average of its three best years during the 1946-49 period, inclusive.”
Whether this policy will be implemented remains to be seen. And, as we have demonstrated, profits in 1946 to 1949 were so high that 85 per cent of this level hardly represents impoverishment. The significant point, however, is that it is difficult to foresee the limits of state intervention, assuming that the Permanent War Economy continues for an indefinite number of years. The promulgation of a profit-limiting policy, even if strictly confined to paper as was the case with OPA during World War II, would horrify the rugged individualists of the pre–1941 era but today is a necessary genuflection to the exigencies of the class struggle.
The all-pervading character of state intervention, with its modifications of the nature and laws of capitalism, should not come as a surprise to any Marxist, for more than 70 years ago Engels wrote (Origin of Family, p. 207):
“But it (the state power of coercion) increases in the same ratio in which the class antagonisms become more pronounced, and in which neighboring states become larger and more populous. A conspicuous example is modern Europe, where the class struggles and wars of conquest have nursed the public power to such a size that it threatens to swallow the whole society and the state itself.”

T.N. VANCE



 
Part IV




Sacred to the operation of traditional capitalism is the ability of the individual capitalist to decide what and how much to produce, as well as the prices at which he will sell his commodities. Under the Permanent War Economy, however, the state assumes directive powers, through various types of controls, that largely supersede the power of the individual capitalist. The bourgeois is no longer undisputed master of his own house. He continues to produce commodities and to accumulate surplus values, in greater volume than ever before as we have previously shown, but only as a result of large-scale state intervention. The ability of the state to direct the economy is basic to the successful operation of the Permanent War Economy. As was shown in Part III, Increasing State Intervention, May–June 1951 issue of The New International, the entry of American capitalism into the permanent crisis of world capitalism with the Great Depression of the 1930’s marked the beginning of the shift of power from the individual capitalist to the state apparatus, representing the interests of the bourgeoisie as a class. While the character of state intervention in depression differs from state intervention under the Permanent War Economy, both periods require large-scale state bureaucracies. To this extent, as well as the psychological preparation for increasing state intervention of both the bourgeoisie and the public at large, depression may be considered a necessary prerequisite to the war economy.
The New Deal served as a school for the development of numerous technical experts in the art of managing state monopoly capitalism and in the equally important area of planning the increase in state revenues required to sustain the expanding state bureaucracy. In 1929, for example, the number of Federal civilian employees was 227,000. In 1933, the figure was only 306,000. It almost doubled by 1939, reaching 571,000. This provided a solid foundation for the expansion that took place under the Permanent War Economy, described in Part III. Some of the key personnel were trained and, more importantly, the practice was begun of borrowing industrial and financial leaders from private industry to administer the various state programs. The New Deal, in short, was an essential framework for the development of the Permanent War Economy.
That a very significant shift has occurred in the role of the state in the economy is officially recognized in the 1951 edition of the National Income Supplement to the Survey of Current Business, published by the Department of Commerce. “The most notable change since 1929 in the use of the Nation’s output,” states this publication, “is a shift from private to government use. In terms of the current dollar estimates of gross national product, government purchases of goods and services, which absorbed 8 per cent of the gross national product in 1929, took 15 per cent in 1950. Personal consumption expenditures, on the other hand, dropped from 76 per cent of the total in 1929 to 6814 per cent last year.” This profound shift can be seen from the summary tabulation boxed below.

It will be seen that the changes in the composition of gross national product were due in considerable measure to differential price movements. Nevertheless, on a constant dollar basis, the role of the state increased almost 50 per cent and occurred at the expense of both consumer outlay and capital accumulation. Actually, a better picture would emerge if the distribution were in terms of net national product, as has been our previous practice. The role of the state in 1950, according to these figures, is somewhat less than we estimated, primarily because our 1950 estimates understated the degree of inflation and the real increase in production that actually took place. We estimated gross national product at $278 billion, while the official figure is now revealed as $283 billion. None of these minor discrepancies in any way invalidates our analysis.
 
THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHANGE that has occurred is carefully overlooked by the Commerce experts’ desire to relate “comparable” years. The history of the last 22 years, despite serious inadequacies in the underlying data, is graphically portrayed by the changing relationship of government purchases of goods and services to total gross national product.

It can be seen that the depression of the 1930’s was accompanied by the first great advance in state intervention in the economy. While the proportion of total output, as measured by gross national product, that went to government purchases of goods and services reached in depression years the level that exists in the postwar period, the significant change that has occurred is the fantastic growth in the proportion going to the Federal government, i.e., the state. From an insignificant level of 1.3 per cent in 1929, it quadrupled during the New Deal, reaching a peak of 6.2 per cent in 1938, undoubtedly sparked by the realization that the “recession” of 1938 was largely due to the decline in state expenditures in the latter half of 1937. We are already familiar with the gigantic rise in war outlays that resulted from World War II, accompanied by a relative decline in the role of state and local government expenditures. The decisive change that has taken place is reflected in the fact that the ratio of Federal government purchases to total output in the postwar period markedly exceeds the prewar period. A ratio of 8 or 9 per cent, virtually all of which is accounted for by direct and indirect war outlays, in its own way signals the advent of a new epoch in the history of capitalism. Without continuing war outlays and state foreign aid, and in the long run these must be on an ever-increasing scale, the vaunted economy of American imperialism would grind to an abrupt halt. Roosevelt and Truman are absolutely correct when they reply to their bourgeois critics with the statement that they have saved capitalism. That capitalism is more “prosperous” than it has ever been, as Truman is fond of boasting, requires a very important qualification. It is true, as we have demonstrated, that profits reached an all-time high in 1950 and that the Permanent War Economy operates so as virtually to guarantee the profits of the bourgeoisie as a class.
The “prosperity” of the Permanent War Economy, however, is rather precarious. The state decides not only how many airplanes, tanks and munitions in general shall be produced, but of necessity determines how many automobiles, refrigerators, tractors, etc., shall be produced and, within limits, the prices at which they shall be sold. From a capitalist point of view, the economic development under the Permanent War Economy must be viewed as unhealthy. The patient achieves a form of recovery from what may be likened to shock therapy. But the treatment is far from painless and even the doctors cannot say whether the cure will be lasting.
The official hope is that “another two years or so” of controls will see American military output achieving sufficient magnitude so that the economy can sustain both the necessary level of war outlays together with a high level of civilian outlays without continued controls. This is clearly a consummation devoutly to be wished, but impossible of realization. An economy devoting 20 per cent or thereabouts of total output to war outlays cannot function without large-scale state intervention, requiring direct and indirect controls.
So powerful has been the development of the productive forces under American capitalism, that just as there is periodically an overproduction of the means of production and an overproduction of the means of consumption, it is not excluded that there can be an overproduction of the means of destruction under the Permanent War Economy. Normally, this does not happen in a war economy precisely because war consumes means of production, consumption and destruction more rapidly than they can be produced. Yet, prior to V-E Day, with a few exceptions, there had been accumulated a sufficient stockpile of many types of munitions to permit cutbacks and to enable the armed forces to fight for many months without additional production.
It was not only the dismantling of the war machine in large measure that produced the notable American inferiority in weapons vis-à-vis Stalinist imperialism at the outbreak of the Korean war. It was also, and perhaps more importantly, the high rate of obsolescence that obtains in the means of destruction. This gap is clearly in process of being overcome at a fairly rapid rate. Assuming, therefore, that large-scale warfare or another “Korea” does not break out, or that an armistice is concluded in Korea, the question arises whether American imperialism will not reach a point in the next few years where the warehouses will be bulging with all types of means of destruction and there will be no place to use them.
Such a development is a possibility. Present evidence, however, indicates that the high rate of military obsolescence, together with the talked-about expansion in the production of “fantastic” weapons, should offset for several years the tendency to accumulate an oversupply of munitions in the absence of total war.
A sharp reduction in war outlays in the near future is therefore unlikely and would in a remarkably short time cause a collapse of the economy. Moreover, it would certainly invite the very aggression of Stalinist imperialism that the military build-up is presumably designed to prevent. It may therefore be expected that American imperialism will continue on the only course open to it until the vast collision with Stalinist imperialism (World War III) takes place.
 
A STATE MONOPOLY CAPITALIST régime in the true sense of the term has developed under the impact of depression and war. It bears a certain resemblance to Bonapartism, but Bonapartism has been traditionally applied by Marxists to a temporary régime of crisis, which poses the issue of revolution or counter-revolution and which marks the end of parliamentarism. As Trotsky puts it in Whither France?, “The essence of Bonapartism consists in this: basing itself on the struggle of two camps, it ‘saves’ the ‘nation’ with the help of a bureaucratic-military dictatorship.” There is, of course, as yet no bureaucratic-military dictatorship in Washington, although there are possible tendencies in that direction. Nor can the present regime, given the tempo at which world history moves, be classified as temporary. There are, however, numerous features of state monopoly capitalism that possess all the earmarks of clearly discernible trends, and which warrant brief mention in this penultimate article in our series on the Permanent War Economy.
In his excellent analysis of the relationship between Bonapartism and fascism in The Only Road for Germany, Trotsky observes that:
“As soon as the struggle of the two social strata – the haves and the have-nots, the exploiter and the exploited – reaches its highest tension, the conditions are given for the domination of bureaucracy, police, soldiery. The government becomes ‘independent’ of society. Let us once more recall: if two forks are stuck symmetrically into a cork, the latter can stand even on the head of a pin. That is precisely the schema of Bonapartism. To be sure, such a government does not cease being the clerk of the property-owners. Yet the clerk sits on the back of the boss, rubs his neck raw and does not hesitate at times to dig his boots into his face.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
For the time being the fascist threat is absent, nor are the “soldiery” in a position of domination. Yet the domination of bureaucracy and the growing power of the police (the FBI) are increasingly evident. As we have remarked earlier, the inter-marriage between the big bourgeoisie and the upper echelons of the military bureaucracy is a basic characteristic of the Permanent War Economy. An important research project is available to someone ambitious enough to document this relationship in every detail. It suffices, however, to point out that innumerable officers were commissioned from the ranks of big business, such as “Generals” Knudsen and Sarnoff, and that many military leaders have become “captains of industry,” as, for example, Generals Somervell and Clay. Of decisive importance is the network of standing committees and organizations relating to ordnance and military procurement needs. These exist in every industry whose output is important to the war machine and is basic to the military planning of all parts of the armed services. Meetings are held periodically, information on latest military techniques and their impact on production requirements is exchanged, and pilot contracts are continually being let to facilitate research and development. Above all, industry is constantly being geared to achieve rapid and complete mobilization in the event of a supreme crisis.
In the event that American imperialism is constrained to maintain more or less indefinitely an armed force of 3,500,000 or more, the power of the military in its daily impact must grow and the alliance between the military caste and the big capitalists will solidify until the day may come when we can truly speak of a “Europeanization” of American politics. This entire development alone is ample reason for describing the present regime as state monopoly capitalist. There are, however, other and perhaps even more significant reasons for stressing this aspect of the Permanent War Economy.
In passing, it should be noted that much of the right-wing criticism of state monopoly capitalist trends is garbed in the raiments of liberalism. Consider, for example, General MacArthur’s Cleveland speech of September 6, 1951, in the course of which he stated that there has been “a steady drift toward totalitarian rule ... a persistent ... centralization of power in the Federal government ... ravenous effort to further centralize the political power ... a determination to suppress individual voice and opinion which can only be regarded as symptomatic of the beginning of a general trend toward mass thought control.” At an another point in the political spectrum comes the charge of Sidney Hook (New York Times, September 30, 1951) that we are experiencing a species of “cultural vigilantism” that threatens the foundations of our democratic structure. Such criticism, regardless of source, possess general validity. Their widespread character is symptomatic of the inroads already made in the body politic by the growing power of the state.
  
IT IS ABOVE ALL IN THE HANDLING of strikes and labor disputes that the monopoly capital character of the state becomes clear. Especially noteworthy has been the role of the state in the various rail strikes, with the Army actually assigned responsibility for running the railroads. There was a time not so long ago when the mere presence of armed forces in a strike, when the soldiers were so to speak performing a picketing function, evoked widespread criticism of threats of fascism and charges of military dictatorship. We have indeed traveled far along the road away from traditional bourgeois democracy when military force can be substituted for the normal process of the class struggle without even raising an outcry of “strikebreaker” in more than the radical press.
With production plans vital to the operations of the war economy, a strike in almost any basic industry immediately threatens to disrupt the war machine or vital war preparations. Hence, the appeals to national patriotism, the resort to fact-finding devices and, where necessary, the mobilizing of public opinion to support intervention by the police power of the state, whether it be coal, transport, airplanes, copper or other crucial industry.
The very technique used to control the class struggle, the widespread establishment of tri-partite wage boards, is in essence a device of monopoly capital. The state, represented by the “public” representative, attempts to resolve each dispute through the technique of arbitration, with the state posing as disinterested and above classes. In those cases where this classless approach fails to work, the power of another arm of the bourgeois state is invoked – the courts, through the use of the injunction. Finally, when no other card is left to play, the state shows that it is still the “clerk of the property-owners” by using its military-police power. Roosevelt was a past master in the use of this technique. But regardless of personalities it is the underlying trend that is significant. The erection of the tri-partite labor-board approach to solving specific class struggles into an entire system, with philosophic justification and techniques for handling every variety of dispute, is more than ample justification for planning the label “state monopoly capitalist” on the political regime under which the Permanent War Economy functions.
The labor bureaucracy willingly accepts its role as junior partner in the regime. It balks only when it either feels that it is being “unfairly” discriminated against in the handing out of administrative positions of power and prestige, or when the pressure from the ranks, under the lash of inflation, compels it temporarily to assert a position of independence. Despite these truths, the abortive history of the United Labor Policy Committee is not without interest.
 
THE UNITED LABOR POLICY COMMITTEE was organized in December 1950, representing all segments of organized labor except Lewis’ United Mine Workers. Its first statement of December 20, 1950, spoke eloquently of “justice and workability” in stabilization measures, but the heart of its concern was its basic objective of equal representation in the organs of the state bureaucracy:
We are fully aware [state the representatives of the AF of L, the CIO, the Railway Labor Executives Association, and the IAM] of the grave emergency confronting our nation. We dedicate ourselves to help make our country strong and to use that strength to bring: peace and abundance to mankind.
It is imperative that labor be granted active participation and real leadership in every important agency in our mobilization effort. We regret that to date labor has not enjoyed opportunity for full participation in the mobilization effort. Free labor can make its fullest contribution only if it is permitted to serve at all levels of defense mobilization both with respect to policy and administration.
No one group has a monopoly of ideas in the mobilization of our resources. Each group has much to offer and cooperatively we can defeat the world-wide challenge of dictatorship. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
This bid for changing the role of junior partnership into one of equal partnership for labor fell on deaf ears, as how could the bourgeoisie be expected to take seriously the position of a labor bureaucracy that appeared to be quite satisfied with its rôle of junior partner in World War II. The Administration, of course, should have had the political savvy to recognize that this bid for increased status stemmed not only from the hurt feelings of the labor bureaucracy, but also reflected dissatisfaction by the vast majority of trade-union workers with the increasing burden that inflation was casting on them. No one, however, has accused the Truman administration of genuine political sagacity. It was therefore quite appropriate for the Wage Stabilization Board to issue Regulation No. 6 on February 16, 1951, establishing a 10 per cent formula that jeopardized both escalator clauses and productivity formulae in union contracts.
The promulgation of Regulation No. 6 immediately prompted the United Labor Policy Committee to declare that a crisis existed and to withdraw from the Wage Board. We assume that our readers are generally familiar with the document issued by the ULPC on this occasion and therefore only reproduce the more interesting passages:
The price-stabilization program is a cynical hoax on the American people ...
Profit margins are being guaranteed. Every consideration possible is being given by government price agencies to enhance the position of business and to protect fat profits ...
The Congress is now considering a program to raise all taxes in such a manner that people in the lower income brackets will be forced to bear a still heavier share of the tax burden ...
So far, virtually the entire defense mobilization program, has been entrusted to the hands of a few men recruited from big business who believe they have a monopoly on experience, good ideas and patriotism ...
This was fairly strong language from a junior partner. Consequently, when Eric Johnston, Economic Stabilization Administrator, approved Regulation No. 6 on February 27, even though it was followed on March 1st with Regulation No. 8, designed to achieve a compromise on the escalator clause question, the United Labor Policy Committee had no choice but to make good its threat. All its representatives from all phases of the administration of the war economy were withdrawn and a policy of boycott established.
The United Labor Policy Committee statement of February 28th, announcing withdrawal of all labor representatives from the war program, carries out the theme of the February 16th statement; the language is even stronger:
On Feb. 16 we announced that we had become thoroughly disillusioned with the conduct of the defense mobilization program. We made the deliberate charge that big business was dominating the program, that the interests of the plain people of this country were being ignored and that the basic principle of equality of sacrifice in the national effort to protect freedom against Communist aggression had been abandoned ... After full and complete exchanges of information, our original convictions have been more than confirmed.
We are today confronted with a price order which ammounts to legalized robbery of every American consumer, together with a wage order which denies justice and fair play to every American who works for wages. The door has been slammed in our faces on the vital problem of manpower, which directly affects the workers we represent ...
We have also arrived at the inescapable conclusion that such representation which already has been accorded to labor in defense agencies and such further representation as is now offered are merely for the purpose of window dressing. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
The gauntlet had been thrown down by the labor bureaucracy. Moreover, Wilson was an extremely vulnerable target. A way had to be found to preserve one of the cornerstones of the state monopoly capitalist régime. In less than two weeks the formula emerged for a tri-partite 18-man board, which would have jurisdiction over all labor disputes, not only wages. Labor was willing. Gone was its indignation over “big-business domination,” the “hoax” of price control, the “guarantees of profits,” the iniquitous tax program, etc.
But industry, as represented by the Business Advisory Council, the NAM, and the Chamber of Commerce, did not like the deal its representatives were cooking up for it. Accordingly, it issued a statement on March 13, 1951, aimed at reasserting its senior partnership. Advocating a clearly defined wage stabilization policy, the representatives of industry declared:
This may result in a number of strikes. It is obvious that strikes under such circumstances are not ordinary labor disputes between employers and employees; they are strikes against the government itself, designed to coerce or induce it into making concessions.
A firm policy in dealing with such strikes is essential to the maintenance of a sound stabilization policy and to preservation of a proper respect for government itself. Such strikes should not be met with appeasement or concession. They should be handled in accordance with existing law, including, where appropriate, the national emergency provisions of the Labor-Management Relations Act. (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
It sounded like industry was ready for a showdown. Wiser heads prevailed, however, and after a month of dickering, industry announced that it would accept the 18-man wage stabilization and disputes board “under presidential request, but protesting the wisdom of the entire set-up.” A compromise formula was put forward limiting the powers of the new board to recommendations in dispute cases, and another compromise was worked out with respect to manpower control. But, in so far as anti-inflation controls are concerned, labor achieved not one iota of its demands.
We have cited at some length the history of the United Labor Policy Committee, which then shortly fell apart as it had outlived its immediate usefulness in the eyes of the AF of L, because it is illustrative of a basic trend of state monopoly capitalism. It is also quite revealing of the role of the labor bureaucracy, whose indictment of big-business domination and economic inequality of the war economy remains entirely accurate, despite the victory on the question of the escalator clause.
 
A Marginal Note
A FRIENDLY CRITIC HAS QUESTIONED our conclusion regarding the standard of living on the ground that “empirical” evidence appears to indicate that workers are better off today than they were, say, in 1939. The statistical evidence presented, or the analysis flowing from the data, are not questioned. But there seems to be some feeling that our case has been overdrawn. After all, more workers have automobiles now than ever before. Many have television sets, which didn’t exist. We admit that unemployment is at extremely low levels, etc. “How, then, is it possible,” asks our critic, “for the workers to have experienced a decline in their living standards?”
In the first place, we have shown that the average per capita standard of living did rise – 17 per cent in 1950 over 1939. We did, however, calculate a slight decline in the per capita standard of living of the working classes – to be exact, a decline of 1.3 per cent from 1939 to 1950. Of course, at the same time, there was a marked improvement in the standards of living of the farming classes, the middle classes and the bourgeoisie. Moreover, it is obvious that with such a slight decline in the standard of living of the working classes, it is quite possible to find this or that worker whose living standards have increased.
We are, of course, not aware of the “empirical” evidence referred to in apparent refutation of one of the fundamental laws of motion of the Permanent War Economy: that an increase in capital, instead of causing an increase in unemployment, is accompanied by relatively full employment and declining standards of living. We suggest, however, that the “empirical” evidence be examined a little more closely. It will be found that the increase in employment far exceeds the increase in the number of families. In other words, the average working class family currently contains a much larger number of wage earners than in 1939. This is primarily due to the inability today of most workers to survive on the basis of one income per family, which was generally typical of the pre-Permanent War Economy period.
Two and three incomes per working-class family are far from being atypical in 1951. Naturally, in many such cases, it is quite possible for the family income, on a real basis, to exceed that of 12 years ago. This does not in any way upset our conclusion that the rate of surplus value has increased, or any other basic conclusion. Even the possible improvement on a family basis must be tempered by consideration of the profound change in income tax laws, not so much with regard to rates as to the decrease in exemptions for dependents. The result has been that the working classes now bear the major brunt of the income tax, whereas previously they were almost totally unaffected.
Seekers after empirical evidence should also interview workers, such as teachers and other civil servants, whose incomes are relatively fixed. They are part of our data on the working classes and they have suffered a catastrophic decline in their standards of living. It should also be remembered that for every working-class family that is able to have two, three or more separate incomes, there is almost an equal number who are not in this position and who, in order to make ends meet, find the one and only income earner forced to take on a second job. This abnormal increase in labor power, solely a product of the inflation, is also encompassed in our figures. All empirical evidence that we have seen supports our general conclusions. The consumer “buying strike” of the spring and summer of this year is additional evidence that the inflation has reached a critical point and that living standards are declining. The fact that redemptions of E bonds exceed purchases, and that liquid savings in general are at extremely low levels, are genuine empirical evidence that our fundamental thesis is eminently correct.
We have digressed at this point not so much to answer our empirical critic, but to observe that the relative stability of the price level during the past six months has eased somewhat the pressure on the labor bureaucracy, but everything, they said about the fraudulent price control program and the unfair tax program, etc., remains true to this very day. As the ratio of war outlays to total output continues to increase, there must be a renewed upsurge of the inflationary pressure. As Wilson’s third quarterly report of September 30, 1951, correctly puts it:
“Despite the present relative stability a critical period in our battle against inflation lies ahead. We must anticipate and prepare for the strong inflationary pressure that will be again encountered as defense spending grows and personal and business incomes mount.”
At that point, which should be reached early in 1952, the attempts to “freeze” the class struggle through tripartite labor boards may run into serious difficulties. If we base ourselves on Marxism, we should be concerned with such fundamentals as what is happening to real wages and real profits, with the basic trends in the class struggle, and not with episodic and invalid “empirical” evidence that dissolves into thin air at the first touch of reality.
 
CONTROL OF THE PURSE STRINGS has always been viewed by Marxists, and correctly so, as a crucial element in the power of any régime. Inasmuch as the American state must go through a tortuous process of Congressional hearings and committees before funds are appropriated, it may be objected that in this vital point there is no possible resemblance to monopoly capitalism. Such a view would be entirely superficial. In fact, one of the really distinguishing characteristics of the present state monopoly capitalist régime is the inability of the legislature to deny in general any requests of the armed forces for funds. This is obviously true in time of actual warfare. It is no less true today, when the need for haste is not as great. Aside from carping criticism against the number of oyster forks ordered by the Navy or a picayune reduction in state foreign aid, there is very little that the Congress can do in the face of a certified statement from the military that they need $60 billion worth of munitions in the next year or $100 billion in two years, or whatever the precise military requirements may be.
Even if all the details were made available, which they are not on grounds of military security in the case of atomic weapons, etc., and even if a Congressman felt himself qualified to question specific military requests, it is politically hazardous for a Congressman to advocate a reduction in this or that military item in the face of the customary statement by a representative of the armed forces that “this is the minimum required to assure the military security of the country; we will not be responsible for military safety if less than this amount is appropriated.” For all practical purposes, therefore, direct war outlays and most indirect war outlays are sacrosanct. The legislature can do little better than rubber stamp the military requests. De facto control of the government purse strings has passed into the hands of the state executive bureaucracy. Even in the present situation, with the Truman administration on the whole confronted with a divided and hostile Congress, the state power to obtain funds is effectively independent of any control by the elected representatives of the people.
It is thus a comparatively simple matter for the state monopoly capitalist regime to manipulate the national debt in a manner best calculated to advance its own political fortunes as well as the class interests of the bourgeoisie. The spectacular rise in the national debt has been one of the chief methods whereby inflation has been promoted and an excellent indicator of increasing state intervention in the economy. The total gross debt of the United States government for selected fiscal years (ending on June 30th) of historical significance is shown in the following tabulation:

World War I increased the national debt by some $24 billion, with the total reaching a peak of $25.5 billion in 1919. Under the influence of the last period of genuine capitalist prosperity, the national debt then declined to $16.2 billion in 1930, the beginning of the Great Depression. Under the New Deal, the national debt rose from $22.5 billion in 1933 to $40.4 billion in 1939, as state intervention in the economy commenced in a significant way. It remained, however, for World War II to cause an unbelievable increase of $219 billion by 1945 and $229 billion by 1946, when the national debt reached a peak of $269.9 billion – the increase in the debt exceeding one year’s total output at that time.
The national debt has become so large that any thought of ever paying it off has long been abandoned. The interest charges alone run to about $6 billion annually at the present time. Inasmuch as the national wealth exceeds the national debt by at least a 2 : 1 ratio, it may be thought that there is no danger in the existence of such a huge debt. In fact, some bourgeois economists of the Keynesian school have projected figures intended to “prove” that the United States can support a total debt, public and private, running into trillions of dollars. From an abstract point of view, it is possible to contend that the only economic limit to the size of the national debt is the ability to meet the annual interest bill. With interest rates considerably lower than what they used to be, under this approach the national debt could easily be doubled or tripled without any serious danger being encountered.
The government, however, does not borrow money merely through the device of printing bonds. If this were the case, it could simply print money – and there would be a galloping inflation of the printing press variety, where the value of the dollar would literally sink to virtually zero. Needless to say, an inflation of this type, of which there are many examples in history (Germany in 1923 being a classic case), places the question of social revolution on the order of the day. The government must sell its bonds. Approximately one-third of the national debt is held by the banks, so controlled under the Federal Reserve System that for all practical purposes they are forced to buy government bonds at the dictate of the Treasury. Under the banking system, these government bonds in the hands of the banks become the base for a tremendous expansion of bank credit, thereby feeding the fires of inflation. Moreover, in a very real sense, that portion of the national debt held by insurance companies, corporations and some individuals, represents prior accumulations of capital for which there is no profitable outlet. Of course, tax-exempt securities should be excluded from any such analysis.
While the national debt has actually declined during the first year of the Korean war, it reached a low of $254.7 billion in April, 1951. At the end of August 1951 it was $256.7, an increase of $2 billion in four months. Further increases in the national debt may be expected as expenditures for war purposes continue to increase. With redemptions of E bonds (of which there is a total of less than $35 billion outstanding, with more than $19 billion falling due in the next four years) currently running about twice as high as new purchases, it remains to be seen whether the new savings bond drive will be sufficiently successful to prevent additional large-scale government borrowing from the banks. In the absence of a pay-as-you-go tax program, the state will naturally have no choice but to borrow the sums needed to finance war outlays.
This type of “creeping” inflation, it should be emphasized, has already reduced the purchasing power of the dollar by about 50 per cent since 1939. Until it gets out of hand, it may prove to be good politics for the incumbent administration, in so far as it generates a pseudo-prosperity conducive to corraling votes. In the long run, however, as maintenance of the Permanent War Economy becomes more and more expensive, and a greater and greater portion of the burden is thrown onto the backs of the working and middle classes, the inflation must continue, bringing with it the threat of a complete capitalist breakdown in general bankruptcy, i.e., unless war does not intervene first. Of course, long before general bankruptcy is imminent, the class struggle will erupt in a new and violent form as the impoverished segments of the population led by the proletariat attempt to throw off their intolerable burdens.
 
THE NATURE OF THE WAR against Stalinism being waged by the American bourgeoisie is such that anti-bourgeois-democratic aspects continually receive encouragement and nourishment. The aim of the American capitalist class is peace, but on a capitalist foundation. This not only dictates the necessity of destroying Stalinism root and branch, but of guarding against socialist developments in England, France and Germany, as well as preventing the nationalist and colonial revolutions in Asia from developing in an anti-capitalist direction. While the current political perspective is one of “neither peace nor war,” American imperialism is fully aware that the only method on which it can rely is the use of overwhelming military might.
Wherein, it may be asked, does this differ from World War II and the American aim to destroy German Nazi and Japanese militarism and imperialism? With respect to the mobilization of military force, there is little difference, except perhaps in a quantitative sense. Long and bitter as was World War II, American imperialism will be faced with an even more formidable foe in Stalinist imperialism. We are fully aware of American superiority in steel production, oil production, transport, and presumably in atomic energy developments. Yet, barring internal political collapse, there can be little doubt that Stalinism will be capable of mobilizing greater military power than the Nazis could at their peak. Moreover, Stalinism does not fight solely with military methods; it also employs political methods on a scale that neither the Germans nor Japanese could begin to approach.
The American bourgeois struggle against Stalinism may therefore require a greater proportion of output devoted to war outlays over a much longer period than was the case in World War II. If such be the case, it can only strengthen all the tendencies that we have already observed to be at work under the Permanent War Economy.
There can be no question, however, about the contrast between World Wars II and III on the political front. Fundamentally, the internal problem in World War II was one of preventing military and industrial espionage in the normal sense of the term. To be sure, a few German Bundists had to be rounded up and either deported or jailed, and, under the influence of hysteria, the Japanese-American population on the West Coast was interned in concentration camps in the interior. But there was no political movement that could penetrate significant layers of American society as a whole, providing not only an excellent nucleus for a possible Fifth Column, but an inexhaustible reservoir of American agents bound by political loyalty to a hostile foreign imperialism. Such, however, is the case with Stalinism.
It is precisely in its handling of the internal menace posed by the existence of a native Stalinist movement that the anti-bourgeois-democratic development of the American bourgeoisie stands most clearly revealed. One has only to cite the nature and manner by which the “subversive” list has been promulgated and used or the recent secrecy order to see how far along the road to authoritarianism, in this respect, American imperialism has traveled. Of course, the primary motivation is fear. But it is not only fear of Stalinism, but fear of any possible anti-capitalist development. It would have been a relatively simple matter, especially in view of the boasts of the FBI that it has its finger on virtually every Stalinist, to have immobilized every Stalinist organization and leader as actual or potential agents of an enemy imperialism. Yet, this was not done. Instead, decree power was used to blanket the most militant anti-Stalinist organizations together with Stalinists as enemies of American imperialism.
American imperialism is first and foremost concerned with preservation of its capitalist and imperialist base. If, in the process, the Bill of Rights, the heart of bourgeois democracy, has to suffer, that is perhaps regrettable, but not as important to the bourgeoisie as maintenance of its property and its system of exploitation. Imagine what the leaders of the American bourgeoisie in its progressive period would say in face of a secrecy order that gives any clerk in any government department the right to classify material as secret or confidential, without any right of appeal, in what is still ostensibly peacetime! We do not say that bourgeois democracy no longer exists in the United States. On the contrary, it does and we shall fight for the preservation of the democratic rights it affords against all its enemies, including the bourgeoisie. But it is important to note the political trends that are unfolding as the Permanent War Economy becomes more and more entrenched. The trend is away from bourgeois democracy. All that is needed is the emergence of a real threat of a militant working class movement, on the one hand, and on the other a fascist threat, and then the question of Bonapartism will become an actual one.
 
WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION IN OFFICIAL and private life has historically been an infallible sign of decadence. The disintegration of the moral fabric of civilization has its roots in a social system that fetters the productive forces and is no longer capable of playing a progressive role. Capitalism has never been particularly distinguished for the honor and integrity of its ruling class. One has only to recall the various methods employed by the “robber barons” in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries during the stage of primitive accumulation of capital to understand why graft and corruption are an integral part of the capitalist method of production. Yet, it is difficult to find a parallel in modern history for the vast corruption disclosed by the Kefauver Committee and various grand juries. The honest public official becomes the rare exception, an occasion for editorial praise.
Bribery takes many forms and is not restricted to public officials tempted by inadequate incomes. On the contrary, American business has erected bribery into a symbol of aggressiveness and an accepted, if not quite legitimate, method of doing business. “Anyone and anything can be bought for a price” is the underlying philosophy. This prevails from a Jay Gould who boasted that he could hire one-half of the working class to shoot the other half to the modern buyer or purchasing executive in a large corporation who expects to be “smeared” if someone wants to sell him something and who expects to “smear” the supplier of something that is difficult to buy if he wants to buy it. It is therefore hardly surprising that virtually every political machine, Democratic or Republican, in any city of size is clearly linked with organized crime.
Every now and then a reform movement temporarily ousts the corrupt machine and, on occasion, a juicy scandal, such as the Teapot Dome affair, is revealed at the level of the Federal government. The present degree of corruption, however, is far more extensive and all-pervading than ever before, and necessarily so because of the development of state monopoly capitalism. This is the era of the “mink coat,” the “deep freeze” and other “gifts” that are generally accepted as the normal method of doing business in Washington. “After all,” says the typical bourgeois, “it is our government; it is there to be cheated and who cares if we cheat ourselves.” An exaggeration? We do not believe so. The American mores tend to condone successful bribery and corruption. It is only those who get caught who are looked upon with a degree of scorn.
With such a background, it is no wonder that as the state intervened more and more actively in all phases of the economy, bribery and corruption have mushroomed to the point where they have become a central political issue. If a businessman cannot do business without a piece of government paper, a priority for raw materials, an allocation, an export license, (a gas coupon), etc., his instinctive thought is to “buy” one. The larger the business, the more prone he is to think of this approach and the greater the possibility of his having the means to carry it out successfully. After all, if congressmen can be “bought,” in the interests of favorable legislation, why not “purchase” a piece of paper that is essential for doing business?
Official recognition of the importance of corruption was given by Truman in his special message to Congress of September 27, 1951, calling for disclosure of incomes of United States officers and employees. While the immediate motive was undoubtedly political, to protect the Democrats from the epidemic of public charges of corruption, the message confirms our analysis and reveals another important trend to which state monopoly capitalism under the Permanent War Economy has given rise. States the President:
“As the burdens of the government increase during this defense period, and more and more citizens enter into business or financial dealings with the government, it is particularly necessary to tighten up on our regulatory procedures, and to be sure that uniformly high legal and moral standards apply to all phases of the relationship between the citizen and his government.” (sic!)
Why is this necessary? Perhaps, because officials in the RFC and other agencies, including the Bureau of Internal Revenue, not to mention the war procurement agencies, are lining their pockets at the expense of the taxpayer and then obtaining highly remunerative positions with the same companies they have helped to circumvent Federal regulations? Hardly this, although the President is “disturbed” because
“I am told that people all around the country are getting a mistaken and distorted impression that the government is full of evildoers, full of men and women with low standards of morality, full of people who are lining their own pockets and disregarding the public interest.”
On the one hand, it is apparently a deliberate plot to discredit the government service:
“Attempts have been made through implication and innuendo, and by exaggeration and distortion of the facts in a few cases, to create the impression that graft and corruption are running rampant through the whole government.”
On the other hand, there is pressure, and there are those who succumb:
“In operations as large as those of our government today, with so much depending on official action in the Congress and in the executive agencies, there are bound to be attempts by private citizens or special interest groups to gain their ends by illegal or improper means.
“Unfortunately, there are sometimes cases where members of the executive and legislative branches yield to the temptation to let their public acts be swayed by private interest. We must therefore be constantly on the alert to prevent illegal or improper conduct, and to discover and punish any instances of it that may occur.”
Truman therefore proposes that all elected and appointed officials receiving salaries of $10,000 or more, plus flag and general officers of the armed services, together with the principal officials and employees of the major political parties, as well as those government employees receiving more than $1,000 annually from outside sources, should be required by law to disclose their entire incomes from all sources, public and private. “The disclosure of current outside income,” states Truman, “will strike at the danger of gifts or other inducements made for the purpose of influencing official action, and at the danger of outside interests affecting public decisions.” Such information would also “be of obvious help in tracking down any case of wrongdoing.”
We doubt that such a law would be particularly effective in eliminating the prevailing widespread corruption, for its roots are much deeper than the president indicates. The “black market” mentality will simply discover new techniques to achieve its objectives. Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that there is little possibility of such a law being passed, we heartily support Truman’s proposal. As he says, “people who accept the privilege of holding office in the government must of necessity expect that their entire conduct should be open to inspection by the people they are serving.” We think that the people would like to obtain a few facts and figures on the extent of corruption that exists, and that they are entitled to such information.
It is undoubtedly sheer coincidence that on the very same day that Truman proposed his anti-corruption legislation, Senator Williams of Delaware, a kept lackey of the DuPonts, succeeded in having the Senate vote to eliminate tax-exempt expense allowances of the president, vice-president and members of Congress, and is quoted in the press as being motivated by the thought that:
“Our country was founded upon the principle that the ruling class would be subject to the same laws as other citizens.”
This is a very touching thought, and we are happy to learn that there is a ruling class in these United States. As to how equitable the tax laws are, we must leave this very important subject to the next and concluding article in this series, when we shall also indicate our concept of a socialist political program to cope with the problems confronting the working class as a result of the development of the Permanent War Economy.

The Permanent War Economy
Part II – Declining Standards of Living
[Section B]
 
Trends In Class Living Standards
THEORETICALLY, THE PROBLEM OF analyzing changes in the living standards of the major classes in capitalist society is not too difficult. All that is required is workable definitions, delimiting each of the major functional classes in terms of their relationship to the productive forces, together with a distribution of their respective claims upon the available supply of consumer goods and services. Statistically, however, we are confronted with the impossibility of measuring per capita standards of living by classes with any real degree of accuracy. Despite the libraries of statistical data relating to the economic system and its functioning, which are so voluminous that no single individual can hope to master all the sources of information in an ordinary lifetime, the unfortunate and highly significant fact is that the data collected and published are not designed to disclose the precise inner workings of an exploitative society. On the contrary, specific information may jeopardize the competitive position, real or fancied, of a firm or an industry or may penetrate the cloak of moral sanctity which a venal ruling class uses to justify many of its actions. There is, consequently, not only a running battle between industry and government over the types of reports necessary for policy formation, especially when economic, controls become mandatory, but also an inherent bias against the full truth in such data as are collected.
The choice, then, is one of halting our analysis of standards of living under the Permanent War Economy at a point where only classless conclusions can be reached, or of pioneering in an uncharted field in the hope that tentative conclusions will be helpful. We have chosen the latter course because there is sufficient empirical evidence that the impact of the Permanent War Economy has not been borne equally by all classes. “Equality of sacrifice” may be an attractive political slogan, but it is largely confined to pious resolutions. Consider, for example, this typical motivation for “equality of sacrifice” from the President’s Economic Message to Congress of January 12, 1951:
“It is essential that the sacrifices which are necessary in these critical times be shared fairly by all groups. Business men will be more cooperative in sacrificing peacetime profit objectives and paying more taxes, if it is clear that this is not being done just so farmers and workers can have more income.
“Farmers will be more cooperative in sacrificing peacetime farm income objectives, if it is clear that this is not being done just so workers can get more wages and business men can get more profits. Workers will be more cooperative in sacrificing peacetime wage objectives, if it is clear that this is not being done just to provide more profits for business or more farm income.
“Professional people, civil servants, office workers and those living on fixed incomes, will be willing to accept their share of necessary sacrifices, to the extent that it is clear that this is not being done just to provide for other people more profits or wages or farm income. All will be willing to make far more sacrifices for national defense and to keep our economy strong, if the burden is shared on a fair and equitable basis.”
The classless approach, plausible as it may appear to some, freezes all the inequities that existed at the beginning of the Permanent War Economy or of any specific mobilization, even assuming that the policy of “equality of sacrifice” is rigorously enforced. Just what the record has been and is likely to be becomes apparent only on the basis of a class analysis.
It must be emphasized that while the class data which follow are experimental yet we believe that the broad conclusions which emerge possess general validity.
 
OUR CLASS BREAKDOWN IS CONFINED to the four major economic classes, working classes, middle classes, farming classes, and bourgeoisie, each concealing within its fairly broad limits rather distinct income and class variations. The bourgeoisie covers the various sections of the capitalist class, that is those who own or control the production and distribution of commodities and services, other than farmers, whose substantial incomes are derived from capital, although in certain cases they may take the form of salaries as corporation officers or managers. It is this numerically inconsequential class of barely more than one per cent of the population that exercises effective control over the economy of the United States. The variation in personal income within the bourgeoisie is greater, percentagewise, than within any other class as it ranges from the moderately well-to-do receiving $20,000 a year to the millionaire and multi-millionaire.
The farming classes cover all those who live or work on farms, whose incomes, whether they be agricultural migratory laborers, tenant farmers, small independent farmers, or large commercial farmers organized as single entrepreneurs, cooperatives or corporations, are derived principally from agriculture. The class differentiations within this group are as obvious as the contrast between the Farmers Union and the Farm Bureau. Although the farming classes currently compromise almost 20 per cent of the population, the income variations are extreme, extending from the poor itinerant laborer and poverty-stricken self-sufficient farmer who barely see any cash at all during the year to the wealthy landowner in California’s lush Imperial Valley or other large-scale farm capitalist whose income and living standard are hardly distinguishable from the millionaire.
The middle classes are much harder to define, as at the lower limit they may overlap the working classes and at the upper limit the bourgeoisie. They include the small shopkeepers, the independent tradesmen and artisans, the independent professionals, and those salaried officials of government and private business who clearly belong to management, especially in relation to the power to hire and fire. Regarding salaried members of the middle classes, we have arbitrarily used as income limits to assist our functional analysis a range of $4,700 to $20,000 for 1948, the latest year for which family income distributions are available. In short, the bulk of single entrepreneurs and partnerships together with a minimum portion of salaried individuals in medium income brackets are numbered among the middle classes. Altogether, we currently place the middle classes at about 12 per cent of the population. If a strict income approach were to be used, the figure would be larger. The decisive criterion, however, is not income but relationship to production. All teachers and most government employees, for example, may think of themselves as middle class, but we have classified them as members of the working classes.
The working classes, consequently, compromise about two-thirds of the population and are much broader in scope than the factory proletariat. All those nonfarm workers who must sell their labor power in order to support themselves and their families, except for the relatively small portion of salaried employees included in the middle classes and the bourgeoisie, are subsumed under the heading “working classes.” In addition to factory wage earners, the overwhelming majority of white collar employees is considered to be part of the working classes. What may be interpreted as an upward bias in the size of the working classes is enhanced by our decision to place all the unemployed and their families in the working classes. This was done not so much for theoretical reasons, although it could be amply justified on these grounds alone, but for the very practical reason that there is no basis whatsoever for assigning any portion of the unemployed to the middle classes, in spite of the fact that members of the middle classes do experience unemployment from time to time and then find employment in a position enabling them to preserve their middle class status. Income variations among the working classes thus range from virtually zero to approximately $5,000 a year, with certain salaried individuals employed by government or organizations receiving considerably more.
Our broad functional, class approach corresponds to the relative fluidity of class lines in the United States. It is interesting to note that even the most patriotic classless appeals for national unity are constrained to recognize the existence of these broad economic classes. Having arrived at these definitions of the four major economic classes, it was then necessary to distribute the population, personal consumption expenditures and government nonwar purchases in accordance with our definitions. Distributing the population by classes did not present any insurmountable obstacles, as we begin with the existence of relatively good data on the farm population compiled by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. The only significant manipulation required here was to allow for those members of the armed forces drawn from agriculture. The recent development of new series on the compensation of corporate officers, together with family income statistics and an arbitrary small percentage of the number of active proprietors of unincorporated enterprises, facilitated the derivation of the size of the bourgeoisie. The extent of the middle classes was based on the number of active non-agricultural proprietors, together with a portion of salaried employees adjusted for functional status and family income data. In effect, therefore, the calculation of the population of the working classes could be derived as a residual, except that the results were checked by using data on the number of non-agricultural employees together with fragmentary information on the number of employees per family and the number of individuals per family by income levels. We believe that the results are fairly consistent with our definitions.
To distribute personal consumption expenditures by clasres required a more elaborate technique starting with the relationship between total personal income and total personal consumption expenditures, the overall data, including projections, being shown in Table V.

*Identical with the series shown in Table II, column one.
†Projections, with 1950 data based on actuals for first nine months,
comparable to methods used for all output figures, with assumptions
regarding increases in personal income taxes necessarily arbitrary.



Personal income, as the name implies, delineates all income payments received by individuals and is presented by Commerce under these major heads: wage and salary receipts, other labor income, proprietors’ and rental income, dividends, personal interest income, and transfer payments. Certain types of income payments, such as net interest paid by government and transfer payments are excluded from national income and product. When personal tax and nontax payments by individuals to government, excluding purchases from government enterprises and consisting chiefly of personal income taxes, are subtracted from personal income the result is equal to disposable personal income which must either be spent or saved. Personal income minus personal tax and nontax payments minus personal savings therefore equals personal consumption expenditures, although the technique used by Commerce measures personal consumption expenditures independently and obtains personal savings as a residual. By analyzing the components of personal income separately, it was possible to break them down by classes in a manner consistent with the class distribution of the population. In certain cases, as foi example rent, the distribution is admittedly arbitrary, but the resulting pattern appears to be plausible. Limitations of space prevent us from showing any of the class derivations. The distribution of personal tax and nontax payments was weighted entirely by the distribution of individual income taxes, as revealed by Treasury data through 1946, an OPA study on Civilian Spending and Saving, 1941 and 1942, and selected TNEC data for 1939. Apportionment of personal savings was based on the aforementioned OPA and TNEC studies, a farm study by the Department of Agriculture for 1946 and, above all, a sample interview survey by the Federal Reserve Board showing the distribution of family liquid assets and savings in 1946 by income groups. We have no brief for the projections except that they seem to be reasonable. If there is any bias it is in the direction of minimizing personal taxes and savings of the working classes so as to maximize their personal consumption expenditures in order to set their standards of living at as high a level as possible.
Personal consumption expenditures by classes were then divided by the respective class populations in order to obtain per capita personal consumption expenditures by classes. To these results were then added per capita government nonwar purchases for the entire population on the assumption, already stated, that each person benefits equally from these contributions of government to the average standard of living. The maximum sum involved was $123 for 1949. The aggregate of per capita personal consumption expenditures by classes and per capita government nonwar purchases yields per capita standards of living by classes, the data for which in both current and constant dollars are presented in Table VI.

We have, of course, used the average price index developed in Table III to translate the current dollar figures into 1939 dollars, although a case can be made that the prices paid for commodities and services are not uniform in their rates of change for the various classes. Aside from the lack of evidence, it is unlikely that any attempt to adjust for such variations in price changes would materially affect the picture that emerges. Even in current dollars, the working classes have clearly lagged behind the rest of society. Merely on the basis of what has happened, as revealed by the increase in per capita standards of living in current dollars from 1939 to 1950, the myth of “equality of sacrifice” vanishes into thin air when confronted by facts. While the working classes were experiencing an increase from $596 to $1,139, a rise of 91 per cent, the middle classes went from $635 to $1,619, a rise of 155 per cent, the farming classes climbed from $295 to $779, a rise of 164 per cent, and the bourgeoisie soared from $7,546 to $21,384, a rise of 183 per cent. Now, as our data for 1951 1953 demonstrate, the disparity between the working classes and the other major classes will become even greater.
The gross average weekly earnings of production workers in manufacturing industries of the BLS, commonly used to describe changes in the status of the average worker, shows a rise from $23.86 in 1939 to about $59 in 1950, or an increase of 148 per cent. This is still below the increase in consumption for other classes and it must be remembered that “take-home” pay is a much better indicator of spending power than gross earnings. It is probable, however, that the factory proletariat enjoys a higher standard of living than most sections of the working classes.
 
TO VIEW THE REAL IMPACT OF THE Permanent War Economy on the standards of living of the various classes, it is helpful to express the per capita data in 1939 dollars contained in Table VI as index numbers. This is done in Table VII and in the accompanying chart, which graphically shows the trends in average and class per capita standards of living.

TRENDS IN AVERAGE AND CLASS PER
CAPITA STANDARDS OF LIVING, 1939–1953



During the war there was a rough sort of equality among the classes, although it is clear that the farmers considerably improved their position. The rise in farm prices, aided by the preferred legislation successfully introduced by the farm bloc, made the farmers the one class whose standard of living exceeded the average. The workers roughly maintained their standard of living at the average level because of the rapid absorption of the unemployed as war outlays increased and the increased earnings due to overtime pay. The middle classes lagged slightly behind the average as many individual proprietors had to abandon their businesses due to the draft and the difficulty in obtaining supplies. The bourgeoisie lagged most, reaching their low point in 1943 when the first sharp increase in taxes took effect. In terms of comparative levels of living, however, the bourgeoisie maintained their overwhelming superiority over all other classes.
The year 1946 marked the transition from a period of relative freezing of class inequities to one where the working classes suffer both an absolute and relative decline in their living standards. From 1945 to 1946, as overtime ceased and unemployment increased with the termination of hostilities, the working classes underwent a decline of 9 per cent in their living standards, bringing them to a level below 1939. At the same time, as business opportunities expanded, the farming classes increased their living standards by 16 per cent, thus bringing them to a level 24 per cent above 1939 and more than compensating for any inequities that farmers may have experienced in 1939 due to their slow recovery from the depths of the depression; the middle classes augmented their living standards by 23 per cent, thereby rising to a level almost 29 per cent above 1939; and the bourgeoisie enhanced their already swollen living standards by 27 per cent, resulting in a level of living almost 34 per cent higher than in 1939. While these unprecedented divergent movements were taking place, the average per capita standard of living for all classes rose some 4 per cent, making the mythical average individual 15 per cent better off than in 1939.
The fate of working class living standards under the Permanent War Economy was irrevocably sealed in 1947, a year of unbridled inflation following the abandonment of price control with wages, contrary to most other forms of income, completely unable to keep pace with the rising cost of living. From 1946 to 1947, while the average standard of living for all classes declined almost 7 per cent, the working classes and middle classes experienced a catastrophic drop of almost 10 per cent and the farming classes experienced almost a 2 per cent decline but the bourgeoisie improved their position by 3 per cent. This meant that the average worker in 1947 was 11 per cent worse off than in 1939, but the average farmer was 22 per cent better off, the average member of the middle classes was 16.5 per cent better off, and the average member of the ruling class was 38 per cent better off. The fact that the average member of American society was 7 per cent better off was of little consolation to the workers who, as usual, bore the brunt of inflation.
Despite strike action and other attempts to improve their situation, the working classes could not show any significant recovery in their living standards by 1950. They still remained worse off than in 1939, while the farming classes were 36 per cent better off, the middle classes 32 per cent better off and the bourgeoisie 46 per cent better off, with the result that our mythical average American was 17 per cent better off. The fact that the average worker, including members of his family, received $1,139 worth of consumer goods and services in 1950 might indicate to the uninformed that the average member of the working classes enjoyed an extremely high standard of living. This is undoubtedly true compared with workers in other countries, but it is not true when compared with the situation of the average American worker in 1939 or of the average member of other classes. It is not even true that the average worker is better off than the average farmer, for in addition to the $779 that the average member of the farming classes received in 1950 he consumed a great many commodities raised on his farm that are not fully reflected in personal consumption expenditures. Certainly, the average member of the middle classes, who received more than $1,600 worth of consumer goods and services, was clearly in a better position than the average worker; and the average member of the bourgeoisie, whose consumption exceeded $21,000 in 1950, enjoyed such a luxurious standard of living that comparison with the average worker is like the position of a Stalinist or feudal lord contrasted with that of a modern or ancient serf. Now, as the ratio of war outlays to total output increases sharply and controls are introduced, we can expect all classes except farmers to undergo a decline in their living standards in 1951. While the average for all classes is expected to decline 6 per cent, the farming classes will hold their own, the middle classes will experience a 2 per cent decline, the bourgeoisie a decline of less than 7 per cent, and the working classes a decline exceeding 9 per cent. A slight improvement in 1952 should then be followed by a further attack on working class living standards in 1953. If our analysis is reasonably valid, and we believe that it is, the disparity between the working classes and other classes will be greater by 1953 than ever before in recent history. A deterioration of almost 11 per cent in the standard of living of the average worker from 1939 to 1953 will be accompanied by a more than 45 per cent improvement in the position of the average farmer, an almost 35 per cent betterment in the status of the average member of the middle classes, and a 43 per cent enrichment in the well-being of the average member of the bourgeoisie. For the working classes the fact that the average member of society will still be 11.5 per cent better off than in 1939 only makes more poignant the general law that as capital accumulates under the Permanent War Economy, there is both a relative and absolute decline in living standards.
There can be little doubt concerning the general picture of living standards shown by the chart. Following the end of the war the working classes have suffered substantially in comparison with all other major economic classes. Inasmuch as the present increase in the ratio of war outlays to total output is taking place at a time when there is relatively little room for further expansion of civilian and total output, the possibility of duplicating the rough equality of World War II is virtually non-existent. There must be a decline in average real standards of living and, under capitalist conditions, the working classes can expect to bear the brunt of this inevitable diversion of resources from civilian to war output. It is indeed a sad commentary on the functioning of a capitalist war economy that the working classes appear to achieve a “more just” share of such consumer goods and services as are produced under an all-out mobilization, when the ratio of war outlays to total output is between 40 and 45 per cent, than under a semi-mobilization, when the ratio of war outlays to total output runs between 20 and 25 per cent.
It is, of course, politically much easier to achieve rough equality when there is very little to share than when more of the things that make life pleasanter are available for distribution. This is virtually a universal law applicable to all class societies. The situation in the United States since 1939, however, has been complicated by a number of factors whose impact, as the years unfold, is seen to be disproportionately heavier on the working classes than on the other major economic classes. We have reference to such elements in the economic equation as the incidence of the growth in population, the incidence of increased taxation, the concentration of net savings, the unequal burdens imposed by the temporary disappearance of certain consumer commodities from the market, the greater intensity of labor as manpower shortages develop, and the peculiarly chronic character of inflation under the Permanent War Economy.
 
AS HAS BEEN INDICATED, the growth in population from 1939 to 1953 has been sizable, amounting to 21 per cent. But Marx’s law concerning the polarization of classes has still been operating. Our tentative data reveal that for the fourteen years under analysis the farming classes will have experienced a decline of 3,600,000, more than enough to offset an increase of 2,000,000 among the middle classes and a growth of 500,000 in the bourgeoisie. Thus the size of the working classes will have expanded by 1,100,000 more than the increase in total population, or an augmentation of 29 million in the working classes. This is tantamount to a working class rate of growth of 35 per cent, with two-thirds of the increase occurring since the end of World War II, in large part due to the rapidly accelerating birthrate. Accordingly, we calculate the working classes as defined represented 63 per cent of the total population in 1939, but the proportion will have risen to 70 per cent by 1953! The pressure of increasing population is therefore almost exclusively in the direction of reducing the living standards of the working classes.
The incidence of taxation falls with increasing severity on the working classes as taxes are increased. We exclude reference to corporation taxes, for corporation profits after taxes have increased far more rapidly than wages after taxes arid, in a good many, cases, corporations have been able to pass higher taxes on to their customers in the form of higher prices. Regarding solely personal tax and nontax payments, the working classes paid less than 10 per cent of the total prior to 1943. With the first big increase in the individual income tax, accomplished more by a lowering of exemptions than an increase in tax rates, the working classes immediately jumped to about 35 per cent of total personal tax and nontax payments. Since 1943, the working classes have borne from one-third to two-fifths of this burden. Naturally, other classes have witnessed an increase in the amount of their personal tax and non-tax payments, but their personal incomes have increased at a much faster pace than those of the working classes. Thus, the increase in taxation rates for the non-working classes has been relatively negligible. We shall return to this subject at a later date, particularly in relation to the current drive to impose a universal sales tax. That taxation, however, has been a potent weapon in reducing the standards of living of the working classes is beyond dispute.
 
SAVINGS OCCUPY A UNIQUE ROLE in any discussion of standards of living. Possession of sizable savings, for example, can readily lead to a higher rate of consumer expenditure than would otherwise take place. This, in turn, would lead to a higher standard of living and, more importantly, to a competitive bidding up of prices where goods are in short supply, thereby depriving those without savings of commodities they would normally be able to obtain if not for the existence of large savings in relatively few hands. The Federal Reserve study previously cited indicates that in 1946 79 per cent of all net savings occurred among those groups with $4,000 or more income. This would indicate that the working classes account for approximately 20 per cent of net savings.
It may be objected that 1946 is not a typical year, inasmuch as personal savings are estimated at only $12 billion, while in the peak year of 1944 personal savings exceeded $35 billion. As a matter of fact, for the fifteen years under consideration personal savings, as can be seen from Table V, are estimated to total $252 billion, an average of almost $17 billion annually in spite of the low levels of 1939–1941. Our estimates indicate that the working classes increase their personal savings very sharply when the decline in the supply of consumption goods is noticeable, and that for the entire period they account for 32 per cent of the total. Thus, two-thirds of the population are responsible for less than one-third of personal savings, while one-third of the population accumulates more than two-thirds of personal savings, a per capita differential against the working classes of more than four to one.
Although personal spending and savings habits vary widely, class differences are the decisive factor in explaining why the average non-worker saves four dollars for every dollar saved by the average worker. By and large, working class savings are fortuitous and temporary, as witness the current decline in the net volume of E bonds outstanding. This is not because workers lack a “sense of thrift” compared with other classes, but because they lack the opportunity to accumulate large savings. Low incomes are hardly conducive to high rates of savings. Given the widespread use of credit, the lower one’s income and therefore one’s savings, the more restricted is the opportunity to obtain credit. Conversely, a person with large savings is a better “risk” than one with little or no savings and therefore more apt to receive credit in any of its various forms. Savings, consequently, have both a psychological and indirect effect on living standards and cannot be entirely ignored in any appraisal of relative standards of living, especially among the major economic classes.
It is clear that no set of statistics can adequately measure the impact on living standards of the disappearance, or relative disappearance, of entire classes of commodities from the market due to the imposition of government controls. If an extreme situation be considered, such as during the war, when the production of certain consumer durables like automobiles, refrigerators, radios, etc., ceased as a result of governmental edict, it may at first glance be thought that the disparity among class living standards is reduced. The living standards of the bourgeoisie, for example, suffer greatly, while those of the working classes are barely affected. There is the rough equality of the ration card. There is also, however, the gross inequality of the black market where “money talks.” Likewise, the big hoarders can never be found among those whose incomes are too low to permit such unpatriotic actions, except on a very small scale. It is frequently stated that “anyone can buy anything for a price.” To the extent that this is true, it tends to offset the declines in the levels of living of the upper classes in a period of actual reduction or elimination of certain types of civilian output. Although it is not susceptible of statistical proof, we suspect that the absolute or relative disappearance of consumer commodities from the legitimate market creates a heavier burden on the standards of living of the working classes than of any other class.
The lengthening of the work week and the payment of premium rates for overtime were important factors in explaining the rapid rise in the personal income of the average worker during the war. There are other methods, however, of increasing the intensity of labor. Speed-up can and does take place, especially where assembly-line methods of production prevail, and it is rarely accompanied by adequate compensation. Again, we are in a field where statistics are conspicuous by their absence. Nevertheless, it can be accepted as a universal law that the greater the shortage of manpower, the greater the intensity of labor. This is a burden that falls almost exclusively on the working classes. It has a most important bearing on real standards of living, for in a very real sense the capacity to enjoy leisure time is as important a measure of true living standards as the ability to purchase consumer goods and services. A worker whose leisure time has been reduced or who is physically exhausted by an inhuman speed-up of the assembly line and therefore in no position to enjoy such leisure time as he may theoretically possess has suffered a decline in his standard of living just as surely as if he experienced a reduction in his real income. This entire problem, in turn, is related to incidence of illness, length of productive working life, income at retirement, and average longevity. There can be little doubt that all these factors adversely affect working class living standards to a marked, if not readily measurable, extent.
 
THE CHRONIC CHARACTER OF INFLATION under the Permanent War Economy is apparent to anyone with eyes to see. Whether the degree of inflation from 1939 to 1950 be measured by the Consumers’ Price Index, which shows a rise of 72 per cent, or the newly announced implicit price index affecting gross output of the Department of Commerce, which reveals a rise of 83 per cent (preliminary), or our own average price index, which displays a rise of 94 per cent, the fact remains that the price level has increased on the average by seven or eight per cent annually over the first eleven years of the Permanent War Economy. This rate of increase in the price level will continue to be maintained, regardless of controls, because inflation is unceasing and permanent. The higher the ratio of war outlays to total output, the greater the degree of inflation. There is no method under capitalism whereby the creation of purchasing power through waste (war) production can be so controlled and absorbed that inflation is eliminated. The value and therefore the price of civilian output is necessarily augmented as the war sector of the economy increases in size and scope. A worker in an aluminum plant, for example, must receive the same wage whether the product of his labor goes into pots and pans or bombers and fighter planes. In the former case, however, he can through the market exchange the labor time expended in the production of pots and pans for food, clothing and other commodities and services needed to provide subsistence and constant reproduction of the value of his labor power. This is possible only because pots and pans possess a use value to other workers. If, on the other hand, he is producing warplanes these are of no interest to the workers who produce food and clothing and, in fact, are not distributed through the market mechanism but by government direct purchase or requisition. The inflation is inevitable because munitions production does not satisfy human wants and therefore cannot contribute to the reproduction or the expansion of the variable portion of capital.
The most that controls can do under capitalism is to slow down the rate of inflation and, if fairly devised and executed, distribute the burden equitably among all classes. It is precisely in this regard, however, that the naked class character of capitalism is most clearly revealed. The per capita output of consumer goods and services from both private and government sources, as was shown in Table VII, has increased, but the living standards of the working classes have declined. Inflation is one of the chief factors in the constant gnawing away at the living standards of the working classes under the Permanent War Economy. Just as taxes are designed to lighten the burden on business, so are inflation controls geared to bear most heavily on wages and to tread lightly on profits. By and large, the profits of the bourgeoisie are in effect guaranteed by the state, while wages rapidly depreciate under the full impact of inflation and controls – but this is a subject for another article.
 
TO A MARXIST, OF COURSE, standards of living are a function of the rate of surplus value. If the living standards of the working classes have declined, both relatively and absolutely, then there must have been an increase in the rate of surplus value. That this has indeed been the case can readily be seen from Table VIII.

The absolute levels of surplus value and variable capital are necessarily tentative inasmuch as they are based on the class distribution of income data. Variable capital has been developed as the sum of wages and salaries of the working classes, wages and salaries of farm employees, other labor income (mainly employer contributions to private pension and welfare funds and compensation for injuries), employee contributions for social insurance, and employer contributions for social insurance. It will be noticed that the summation of variable capital and surplus value equals net national product in current dollars, as shown in Table I. In other words, on the theory that net national product actually represents the net value of current production or the total values created by labor power in the process of production, we have subtracted variable capital from net national product in order to obtain the magnitude of surplus value. The rate of surplus value is calculated as in Marx by dividing the mass of surplus value by the mass of variable capital.
The projections for employee and employer contributions for social insurance are arbitrary, although based on the anticipated effect of the revisions in the Social Security Act and our previously developed projections for the various income and output measures. These represent shares in current production even if they can only be spent in the future. A more serious objection to the simplified method used is the inherent assumption that the entire income of the non-working classes is derived from the surplus values created by the working classes, whereas it is clear that a portion of the income of some farmers, some single entrepreneurs and even some members of the bourgeoisie represents productive labor. It is felt, however, that this is substantially offset by the broad definition of the working classes, which includes many unproductive workers (in the Marxian sense), such as government employees, certain types of white collar workers as salesmen, insurance agents, etc., the unemployed and retired workers. Moreover, the bourgeoisie and middle classes are heavy beneficiaries of employer contributions to private pension and welfare funds.
The calculated amount of surplus value appears to be reasonable and the rate of surplus value coincides with everyday observation and what one would expect to find from a more detailed study. Even if exception be taken to the magnitudes of s and v, the rising trend in the rate of surplus value is clearly established. From 1939 to 1953, the rate of surplus value will have increased almost 40 per cent. Eschewing our projections, this sizable increase in the rate of exploitation was already reached by 1948. It is only since then, and belatedly, that the trade union movement has made some slight progress in reducing the rate of surplus value. The conclusion is inescapable that the enormous growth in the productivity of labor since 1939 has not redounded to the benefit of the working classes.
The rise in the rate of surplus value from 92 per cent in 1939 to 129 per cent in 1948 and to an estimated 123 per cent in 1950 provides an incontestable refutation to the puerile argument of the apologists for the status quo that “labor has fared as well as anyone else, for wages and salaries remain fairly constant at about two-thirds of the national income.” What these gentlemen conveniently overlook is the fact that wages and salaries constitutes a completely misleading income classification, concealing within its broad cover the six-digit salaries of corporation executives, Hollywood actors and leading public entertainers, not to mention the salaries of all types of people in managerial and semi-managerial positions. To lump together the salary of a Charles E. Wilson (General Motors or General Electric) with the $50 or $65 weekly wage of a typical factory worker is simply to render impossible any type of scientific analysis concerning standards of living or the real workings of the economic system. And the evidence is clear that compensation of corporate officers, for example, has increased faster than the wages and salaries of other corporation employees.
It is no longer possible to arrive at an approximation of the magnitude of surplus value, as Marx did, by adding the shares of income admittedly paid out in the form of profits, interest, rent and royalties. It is equally necessary to include a large portion of wages and salaries, representing currently at least all salaries in excess of $10,000 annually. Such an adjustment, obviously required if the true position of the working classes is to be realistically examined, results in an increase in the mass of surplus value of about one-third and almost doubles the rate of surplus value!
Reducing the rate of surplus value does not arrest inflation, but it would help to make the burdens of inflation and declining standards of living more equitable. These are the immediate and central tasks of the working classes on the economic front. The longer they are delayed the more likely is the new environment of the Permanent War Economy to entrench itself and to condemn the mass of humanity to an existence devoid of hope for escape from the threats or reality of misery, war and totalitarianism.

The Permanent War Economy
VI – Taxation and the Class Struggle
[Section B]
THAT TAXES HAVE BECOME a major arena of the class struggle can be seen from the sharply divergent position of the various classes with respect to proposals for increased taxation and the bitterness that conflicts over taxation have engendered. With taxes taking a steadily increasing proportion of current output in order to finance the war machine and its inevitable bureaucratic apparatus, it is only natural that this should be the case. The impact of taxation in general has become so great that all classes and all income levels feel “hurt in the pocket-book,” which is popularly believed to be the severest hurt of all. At any rate, it is a fact that today no major business transaction is consummated or policy adopted without careful examination of the impact on the tax position of the corporation or stockholder involved.
There has likewise been a noticeable trend toward crystallization of opposing and conflicting class positions with respect to taxation policy. Although an element of fluidity in class positions and attitudes toward various proposals to increase tax revenues still prevails, we can distinguish sharply among the positions of the more class conscious strata, especially the industrial bourgeoisie as represented by the NAM, organized labor, particularly its left wing as represented by Reuther, and class-conscious socialists. The most fully developed and highly articulated class position is that of the NAM for a uniform manufacturers’ excise tax. The NAM position was adopted in 1949 and is presented in its post-Korean form in a basic study entitled A Program to Combat Inflation by Paying-As-We-Go, approved by the NAM’s Board of Directors on February 21, 1951 and published as Economic Policy Division Series No. 38. Its chief features are put forth in a popular catechism of 34 questions and answers on A Manufacturers’ Uniform Excise Versus A Retail Sales Tax, appearing as a special report of NAM News, May 5, 1951.
We need not be concerned with the internecine quarrel within the bourgeoisie between the advocates of a Federal retail sales tax and the NAM advocacy of a manufacturers’ uniform excise tax. Both are taxes on consumption to be paid by the consumer, i.e., those least able to afford higher taxes. Both are designed to shift the major burden of taxation to the workers and lower middle classes. Advocates of both positions are prepared to accept either method as offering the best prospect of maintaining the wealth and power of the bourgeoisie and still assuring needed support for the capitalist state. Aside from technical differences, the major dispute is one of perspective. Advocates of the retail sales tax, representing less reactionary segments of the bourgeoisie and their supporters, view such measures as “temporary,” to be repealed after the “emergency” is  over”.The NAM, on the other hand, states categorically:
“For the purposes of the long-range future, this uniform tax at a moderate rate should be regarded as the basic federal excise, to be carried through into the period beyond the defense period, or even a third war, as a permanent feature of federal taxation.” (Italics in original.)
The NAM is quite open in its objective. Catechism 5 goes:
“Q. Why has the NAM recommended a uniform excise tax? A. This recommendation is made for two reasons: 1 – TO CORRECT THE DEFECTS OF THE EXISTING FEDERAL EXCISE SYSTEM ... A uniform excise tax across the board on all consumer purchases would introduce equality of tax burden in proportion to purchases of consumer goods. It would put all producers on a par in competing for the consumer dollar ... 2 – TO ESTABLISH A BROAD BASE OF CONSUMPTION TAXATION. The distribution of a part of the total tax load over income as it is spent will make possible the levy of less heavy taxes on income as it is received. Thus the attainment of the dual objective of high-level production and consumption would be less hampered than by extreme concentration of taxes on income as received, a policy that would diminish the incentives to work in order to get income.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
If the motivation is not entirely clear, we can cite catechism 13. Because of its touching solicitude for the general welfare, and its conscious and unconscious revelation of NAM philosophy, we reproduce it in full:
“Q. Would a manufacturers’ uniform excise be an unfair burden on the low-income groups?
“A. No. The excise or consumption taxes are one of the tax methods which the Government must use in order to keep the defense program on a pay-as-we-go basis. There must be some tax payment toward this cost by all, regardless of the level of their income. There is not enough income left after present taxes in the middle and higher incomes to pay the bill, even if all of the income after tax were confiscated. The lower incomes must carry a part of the load.
“Available figures show that if food, rent, and various services are excluded, as they would be under the NAM program, the relative burden of excise taxes would rise somewhat as income increases. In other words, the more one has to spend, the more he is likely to spend, and hence the more excise tax he will pay.
“In the financing program which the nation faces there is a choice of evils. If we try to protect too many people against an increase of tax burden, we shall fail to keep on a pay-as-we-go basis. The alternative to this course is inflation, and this would inflict a heavier burden on all consumers than they would have to carry as a tax load. If we try to balance the budget by increasing income taxes, it will not be possible to shelter the small incomes from this tax. Excise taxes will be a means of keeping income tax rates lower than they would otherwise have to be, and thus they become the least of the evils, for the small income groups and for all taxpayers.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
It would be difficult to crowd more arrant nonsense and utterly false reasoning in such a short space. The ignorance betrayed on the causes and effects of inflation, not to mention the relationship of taxation to inflation, is equalled by the erroneous statements on the facts of economic life and the evident self-contradictions. In fact, the only correct statement in the entire catechism is that consumer expenditures are related to income. The implication that the lower incomes are relatively untaxed is completely false, as already shown. The statement that even confiscation of income of upper income levels would not raise sufficient revenue to balance the budget is sheer nonsense. As Table VIII demonstrates, in 1948 there was over $20 billion left after Federal income taxes in the $10,000 and over category. In spite of increased taxes (which do not apply to the NAM argument), there is at least that sum available today, and the Federal deficit is never presented, at more than half that figure. There are, in fact, many ways of raising the amount stated as necessary to finance the war program without increasing taxes on incomes under $4,000 by one cent.
The NAM position, taken at face value, becomes the ludicrous one of asserting that higher income taxes are equally bad for rich and poor, and that higher excise taxes, whose burden is admittedly heavier on the mass of the population, will favor rich and poor alike. The sleight of hand by which the majority of the population in the low-income groups is supposed to favor a tax program designed to minimize the tax burden of the upper income groups is matched by the effrontery that attempts to pass off sales taxes as progressive because they are proportional.
In passing, it should be noted that the NAM is not opposed to increasing the yield from the income tax if it be done through reducing the present exemption for dependents from $600 to $500. The important question, however, is at what rate would the uniform excise tax have to be placed in order to achieve the NAM’s objective of a balanced budget. And how much of an increase would this bring in the average price level?
While the NAM carefully avoids such questions in its popular catechism, it provides its own answer in its programmatic statement:
“At current levels of gross national product, a tax base for the uniform manufacturers’ excise tax of $90 billion is estimated. With no allowance for the effect of high rates on the volume of consumption buying, a flat rate of 10 per cent would produce $9 billion, and a flat rate of 20 per cent would produce $18 billion, as compared with $4 billion under the present selective system [not true by more than $4 billion as shown in Table I; even if the figure is intended to refer only to excise taxes other than liquor and tobacco, it would be $4.5 billion in 1950 – T.N.V.]. These rates on the final manufactured price would become equivalent rates of 5–6 per cent, and 10–12 per cent, respectively, in relation to the retail price.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
It is clear that maintenance of the war program at NAM-approved levels, would require a uniform excise tax on manufactured commodities other than food of close to 20 per cent. For the working masses, this would raise the cost of living by about 8 per cent. Why direct inflation is any worse than such a tax-legislated inflation is not at all clear. It is clear, however, why the Administration has so far rejected the NAM program as politically unfeasible, and has proceeded to maintain the existing tax structure, by raising income, corporation and excise taxes.
 
ORGANIZED LABOR’S OPPOSITION to the tax gouge was indicated in the previous article by quotations from statements issued by the United Labor Policy Committee. Its position on the Revenue Act of 1951 is adequately indicated by a CIO press release of September 20, 1951, in which
“The CIO charged that the tax bill under Senate consideration will represent a $1.10 weekly cut in take-home pay for four-member families with incomes of $4,000, and called for a series of six improvements ...: (1) remove the $1.3 billion excise tax increases; (2) eliminate tax increases on incomes under $4,000; (3) close the split income loophole; (4) eliminate alternate methods of computing income tax that benefit the wealthy; (5) retain House-passed provisions on excess profits and corporation taxes; (6) levy a withholding tax on dividends and interest.”
The CIO estimated that these amendments would provide a net increase in taxes (above what Congress actually passed) of more than $2 billion. And, of course, by closing certain loopholes and eliminating certain regressive features, the CIO’s proposal would have resulted in a less reactionary tax system. Unfortunately, in the absence of a united and forcefully expressed position on the part of the trade-union movement, the Administration could afford to ignore the attitude of organized labor.
In relation to the future of the tax question, the last paragraph in the CIO statement is most interesting:
“Of all the raids upon the incomes of workers, farmers, professional and fixed-income persons contained in this bill, the $1.3 billion excise (sales) tax gouge is the most outrageous and, when compared to the split income and alternative tax rate loopholes for the well-to-do, the most immoral proposal in the bill. Moreover, these increases and extensions of excise (sales) taxes must be fought and should be defeated because they are preliminary steps in the campaign led by the NAM in fastening a comprehensive Federal sales tax upon the American people as part of a permanent tax policy.”
In the light of the NAM-spearheaded drive to shift a substantial portion of the tax burden from the upper income groups to the lower income groups, and the apparent awareness of the CIO, at any rate, that the fight over sales taxes will become increasingly important as time goes on, the statement of Walter Reuther on taxes of August 8, 1951 (carefully ignored by the press) is of considerable interest. Criticizing the NAM’s proposal, Reuther analyzes the shift in tax burden that would result were the uniform excise tax substituted for income taxes to the extent desired by the NAM:
“As of 1948, the NAM’s proposal would have reduced by $5 billion the tax burden on families with incomes ranging upward from $5,000 and shifted an equivalent burden onto those with income below $5,000. More than $3 billion of the savings in the upper brackets would have been gained at the expense of those with incomes of less than $4,000 a year ...
“In terms of its impact on individual families, the NAM proposal as of 1948 would have been equivalent to a wage cut of $133 a year, $2.56 a week, or 6.4 cents per hour for spending units whose breadwinners earn less than $1,000 a year. For those earning $7,500 or more the NAM seeks an income increase averaging $1,760 a year, $33.85 a week or 84.6 cents an hour, on the basis of the 1948 situation.”
The interesting part of the Reuther statement, however, is not so much the criticism of the NAM proposals, or the existing tax structure, which largely parallels the material presented herein, especially the position of Kreps, but his proposal to adopt a spendings tax as an equitable anti-inflationary device. To quote from the press release summarizing his statement:
“The kind of tax on spending proposed by Reuther was proposed by the Treasury Department in 1942 after extensive study by the department.
“‘As far as we have been able to determine,’ Reuther said, ‘the proposal was never given adequate consideration in Congress.’
“In describing how the tax on spending would work, Reuther said: ‘In essence, the Treasury proposed (in 1942) that spending above specified exemption levels be taxed on a graduated basis. To take a hypothetical example, suppose an exemption of $1,500 per person were allowed. In that case, a family of four would be liable under the spending tax only if its spending exceeded $6,000 a year. For purposes of this example, we can assume tax rates equal to the surtax rates proposed by the Treasury, which were as follows:



Spending


    


Tax Rate




Less than $1,000 above exemptions


10%




$1,000 to $2,000 above exemptions


20%




$2,000 to $3,000 above exemptions


30%




$3,000 to $5,000 above exemptions


40%




$5,000 to $10,000 above exemptions


50%




Over $10,000 above exemptions


75%



“‘Thus, a family of four which spent a total of $7,000 would be liable to a spending tax of 10 per cent on the last $1,000 or $100. A similar family which spent $10,000 would have to pay a tax of $1,000. A four-person family spending $25,000 would pay a spending tax of $10,650.
“‘Such a tax would obviously be a powerful deterrent to nonessential spending. Yet if the exemption level were set high enough, no family would be hampered in the purchase of necessities. Every well-to-do family could maintain a high standard of living – only its standard of luxury would be somewhat curtailed. Proper exemptions would assure that only nonessential spending would be taxed. Exemptions would protect large families, who would suffer worst under a sales tax.’”
While the administrative difficulties in collecting and preventing evasion under a spendings tax would be vastly greater than Reuther is willing to admit, the proposal merits serious consideration, especially if the main emphasis in future tax programs is to be prevention of inflation. Although Reuther indicates that the revenue to be anticipated from a tax on spending along the lines he proposes would be about $10 billion, it is extremely doubtful, given its administrative difficulties, that a spendings tax could be relied on to close the gap in the Federal budget. This is our major objection to the Reuther proposal, for a tax program to be politically effective must point the way toward an end of deficit financing. Nevertheless, if the trade unions show any disposition to espouse the spendings tax, socialists should unhesitatingly give it complete support.
 
THE LIBERAL POSITION with respect to taxes has been indicated by the material cited from Kreps. Fundamentally, as exemplified by the ADA, it operates within the present tax structure, concentrating chiefly on eliminating present tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy. Most emphasis is usually placed on removing the split income provision, although Kreps also wants to “regraduate tariffs down to a maximum of 10 per cent.” The liberals worry about both “not raising taxes so high as to impair incentives to work” and “placing the main burden on those who can afford to pay it.” Their dilemma increasingly reflects a central contradiction of the Permanent War Economy.
The liberal position roughly coincides with that of the Administration, and is quite close to that of the labor bureaucracy. In the popular vernacular, it may be summarized as “Let’s have both guns and butter.” As civilian standards of living are impaired under the pressure of increasing war outlays, the liberals necessarily make concessions to the position of big capital, which may be summarized as “More guns and less butter.”
It is particularly important, however, that all possible forces be united against the bourgeois contention that they do not have the money from which additional taxes could come, even if their incomes were to be confiscated. This palpable falsehood is paraded not only by the NAM, as revealed above, but by every segment of the big bourgeoisie. Their financial and economic writers take particular delight in expatiating on what they mistakenly regard as a basic fallacy in the position of everyone else. Writes Edward H. Collins, chief financial writer of the New York Times, in his column of October 15, 1951:
“The rapidly contracting elbow room left in the upper individual income brackets is illustrated by a segregation of incomes of $10,000 or higher. If all such income were to be taxed at the rate of 100 per cent, according to a recent estimate by Harley Lutz [tax consultant to the NAM – T.N.V.], the yield would amount to only $3.5 billion. And the pending legislation proposes to take one billion of this.”
Lawrence Fertig, economist apologist for the bourgeoisie, repeats the same argument in the New York World-Telegram and Sun of June 11, 1951, by citing statistics from Treasury Secretary Snyder’s report of February 5, 1951: (see box below)

“Look carefully at these figures. Obviously the raising of three to four billion of extra income taxes will have to come mainly from the citizens of moderate incomes because the steeply progressive income tax has already stripped the higher brackets.”
The answer to the canard that there is only $3.5 billion left to be taxed in the over $10,000 income bracket is that the Treasury presents all kinds of tax figures and a certain amount of obvious care must be exercised in using them, as a letter to the editor of the New York Times by George W. Hewitt, published on November 22, 1951, reveals. The Lutz-Collins-Fertig-NAM-etc. conclusion that there is practically no money left to be taxed within the bourgeoisie is based, apparently, on Table 13 of Secretary Snyder’s report, where the data are based on “surtax net income.” The same Treasury report, Table 12, shows that only 7 per cent of “gross income” is in the under-$2,000 class.
The manipulation, to which the Treasury has wittingly or unwittingly contributed, is explained by Mr. Hewitt as follows: “But there are two departures from previous usual custom found in Table 13 that accentuate this segregation of taxable income in the lower-income brackets and away from the higher brackets, which in our opinion may lead to misunderstanding of the conclusions reached. First, married joint returns are considered as two taxpayers, each with half of the combined surtax net income. Second, amounts subject to the 50 per cent alternative rate on long-term capital gains are excluded from income.
“In the great majority of cases it is the husband’s income that determines the family status, the wife ordinarily having little or no income. We commonly think of a family in which the husband has a $22,000 salary, for example, as being in the above-$20,000 class as to gross income and slightly below $20,000 on taxable income classification. But in Table 13 viewpoint we will have two incomes, each of which will be classified as under $10,000. As married people making joint returns are 3.5 to 1 in ratio to single taxpayers, this detail should be held definitely in mind when drawing conclusions as to taxable income totals in certain groups.
“As to exclusion of long-term capital gains from income, we do not see how this can be done logically, when the Government has already set the precedent by including 50 per cent of these gains in adjusted gross income. That much of these sales is surely to be considered as income.
“Few persons have reference to Table 13 in the Treasury report. When conclusions are drawn from this table and presented to us it would be helpful to have notations made of the conditions governing the tabulation. But simpler and clearest would be to present surtax net incomes and tax based on adjusted gross income brackets and taxable returns.
“In this method of presentation it would be found that in gross income classification of over $10,000 the total taxable income of that group is $28.4 billion and tax is $9.9 billion, the difference between income and tax being $18.5 billion. In gross income classification of over $4,000 the total taxable income is $62.4 billion and tax $16.9 billion, the difference between income and tax being $45.5 billion.”
Moreover, without reference to the split income feature and the omission of capital gains income, it is obvious that the income of those in the $10,000 and over surtax bracket is also included in all lower surtax brackets. The claim that bourgeois incomes have been virtually confiscated by high income taxes stands revealed as a miserable deception – one that on the part of the professional apologists of the bourgeoisie is either conscious, or they are guilty of gross incompetence in the handling of economic data.
Such chicanery and stupidity have, however, apparently had some effect, for an editorial in the World-Telegram and Sun of October 11, 1951, reveals that a Gallup poll shows 59 per cent of the population in favor of limiting Federal income taxes to a maximum of 25 per cent of anybody’s income. It is also revealed that a constitutional amendment for such an income tax limitation has already been endorsed by 25 states. If 32 states go on record for such a limit, Congress will have to reckon with a constitutional barrier to higher income taxes. In fact, such a limitation would reduce existing income taxes, and automatically guarantee adoption of the NAM tax program.
 
A CAPITAL LEVY is the only rational approach to the current problem of taxation. That is the socialist answer to the NAM tax program and other proposals to make the working masses bear the main burden of supporting the war economy. A levy on capital is not only just since the war economy has as its primary aim the protection of the wealth and power of the capitalist class, but it is the only method of taxation that can readily and easily raise the huge sums that the bourgeoisie claim are necessary to support the capitalist state.
Historically, socialist parties, particularly in Europe, have traditionally mentioned a capital levy whenever the problem of taxation has become acute, but the literature on the subject is rather sparse. In the United States, a proposal for a graduated capital levy was made by former Senator Elmer A. Benson of Minnesota. The Benson proposal was inserted in the Hearings on the Revenue Act of 1942 by Benjamin C. Marsh, representing the “People’s Lobby.”
“The proposed tax or capital levy would be in effect for 1 year and would be levied on the total value of all property owned by individuals at a graduated rate from 1 to 20 per cent, and the tax would be payable in 18 monthly installments with a 6 per cent discount for payment in advance. Married persons would be given a credit in paying the tax of $500 and single persons a credit of $300.”
The Benson capital levy was a naive proposal, whose rates on personal property would run from 1 per cent on $10,000 and under to 20 per cent on all personal property over $1 million. It would have been difficult to collect and would not have raised any great sum, for the major capitalist wealth is owned by corporations. Moreover, there is little point in attempting to assess personal wealth that is not functioning as capital. It is capital that is responsible for the development of the Permanent War Economy and it is capital that should be taxed to provide the finances that the bourgeoisie consider to be necessary.
To keep the capital levy simple and easy to administer, it should at this time be assessed not on all corporations, but on those with assets in excess of $1 billion. There were 58 such billion-dollar companies at the end of 1950, whose combined assets totalled almost $148 billion. A 10 per cent capital levy on corporations whose assets exceed one billion dollars would therefore raise $15 billion. This would be more than ample to balance the Federal budget, even after rescinding the increases provided under the Revenue Act of 1951.
A survey by Alfred F. Connors, copyright by United Press, was published toward the middle of 1951 on the firms with assets in excess of one billion dollars. The list below was taken from the New York World-Telegram and Sun, and compares these 58 leading corporations’ assets at the end of 1950 with end of 1945.

It will be seen that 35 banks and insurance companies account for $107.7 billion, or almost 73 per cent of the total assets of the leading 58 billion-dollar firms. Thus, if it be objected that a capital levy of 10 per cent on gross assets would create insurmountable difficulties as the banks and insurance companies may not have a 10 per cent equity in their total assets, our proposed capital levy can easily be transferred to a 10 per cent tax on all corporations with net assets in excess of one million dollars.
Such a tax on capital would easily raise more than enough to balance the Federal budget after rescinding the increases contained in the Revenue Act of 1951, for a glance at Table VIII-A of Part III (The New International, May–June 1951) shows that the book net assets of 3,304 leading corporations on January 1, 1950 totalled $101.9 billion. Since that compilation by the National City Bank excluded the banks and insurance companies, there cannot be more than $40 billion of duplication even if there were no difference between net and gross assets. The banks and insurance companies, however, should not escape from a capital levy, as of all privately owned institutions they are the most parasitic and are strong candidates for nationalization even under capitalism.
A 10 per cent capital levy on the net assets of all business firms with net assets over $1 million would therefore yield at least $15 billion. Most corporations could pay such a tax out of surplus and undivided profits. Those that could not could either borrow the money or arrange to turn over an equivalent amount in shares of stock to the government, sufficient to pay their capital levy tax liability.
In other words, contrary to the position of the NAM that taxes must be paid out of current income, there is no reason why taxes cannot be paid out of past income by those who have accumulated capital through exploiting the labor of others. To the extent that the workers and lower middle classes own stock in corporations that would be subject to the capital levy, they will gladly reduce their equity in such means of ownership by 10 per cent.
Of course, the rantings of the bourgeoisie and their paid hirelings against a capital levy can easily be imagined. They will cry “socialism,” as if that were an argument. Actually, a capital levy is possible only under capitalism, although it might well be a step in the direction of socialism. It is doubtful, however, that a 10 per cent levy on capital would seriously impair the functioning of capitalism. They will also “argue” that a capital levy is inflationary, for corporations “would have to increase the prices of their commodities and services sufficiently to recoup the losses of capital arising from the capital levy.” Why this follows would be clear only to those who believe that the rights of property are sacred and at all times to be placed above human rights. In any case, maintenance of price control would prevent a sudden recoupment of the capital that has been taxed away. If anything, a capital levy would be deflationary for capital accumulation is one of the main contributing forces to inflation.
 
IF THE BOURGEOISIE object to a 10 per cent capital levy as too radical, we can offer them as an alternative the proposals of two of their most eminent spokesmen. We refer first to the late President Roosevelt and his proposal that during World War II a ceiling of $25,000 be placed on individual incomes. If such a proposal possessed validity at that time, as it did, it is surely even more germane to a fight for capitalist survival against Stalinism, which is the underlying raison d’être of the Permanent War Economy today.
And, if Roosevelt was too radical for the American capitalists, we give them that arch-capitalist, Bernard M. Baruch, who wrote a 500-page book in 1941 called American Industry in the War, the main theme of which is Take the Profit Out of War. In his testimony on the need for price control, published in the New York Times of September 20, 1941, Baruch amazed his fellow capitalists by stating:
“We have talked for years of taking the profit out of war. Price control is one of the ways to do it. The inflationary process affords an opportunity to many to reap huge rewards, while the average person with a fixed income must tighten his belt ... America, which has refused to take a foot of territory for its own war profit, should show the way so that its citizens shall not profit from war. I cannot emphasize this too strongly. We have talked about it, we have written about it, we have preached about it, we have radioed about it. Veteran organizations and Congress both have adopted resolutions about it – that there shall be no profits from war. Let us now make good that promise ... But I must emphasize that no tax program alone can recapture all excessive profits. Profits must also be controlled at their source, which is rising-runaway prices. We must not have a crop of ‘defense millionaires’ to parallel 1918 ‘war millionaires.’”
Understandably, all that happened was more talk, inequitable controls, and a crop of war millionaires in World War II that far exceeded those produced by World War I. With the Permanent War Economy conducted by the representatives of the big bourgeoisie in their own interests, with the state guaranteeing profits, as we have previously shown, there is no tendency toward any decrease in the number of war-induced millionaires at the present time. We do not question the fact that the problem of incentives and capital accumulation is becoming an ever more difficult one for the bourgeoisie to solve. That is the reason for the NAM drive for a politically unpopular universal sales tax. But the state manages to ease the burden for the patriotic capitalist through five-year amortization of war plants, sizable war contracts and, above all, an economy propped up by huge war outlays.
The bourgeoisie moan and weep crocodile tears because on the average profits after faxes in 1951 are running 10 per cent below 1950. But, as we have shown, profits in 1950 reached an all-time historic high. They will probably never again be equalled. We can sympathize with the millionaire who finds it increasingly difficult to become a billionaire because of high taxes, but the real impact of high taxes under the Permanent War Economy is to make it increasingly difficult for the ranks of the bourgeoisie to be replenished with new entrants from the working and middle classes. That is why the bourgeoisie so tenaciously hang on to the biggest tax loophole of all, the capital gains tax. This is virtually the only device left whereby a newcomer to the bourgeoisie can amass a fortune and legally retain it. So-called capital gains should definitely be classified as income and taxed at 100 per cent of the value of net gains or profits.
 
NATIONALIZATION OF WAR INDUSTRIES must be the chief slogan of socialists in the period of the Permanent War Economy. That is the only effective way to “take the profit out of war.” And the definition of war industry must not be confined to atomic energy and government arsenals that are already nationalized. It must be extended to every industry whose output goes mainly in a period of all-out war to direct war outlays. In general terms, the war industries are usually defined to include metal mining, oil and gas mining, chemical and petroleum refining, metal fabrication, and contract construction. This is the way they are defined by Simon Kuznets in Our Economy in War, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. While there may be some difficulty in classifying certain plants whose output is mixed as between war and civilian purposes, and easily interchangeable one with the other, a good working guide would be to declare a company part of a war industry, and subject to nationalization, if 50 per cent or more of its output went for war purposes in 1943–1944.
Nationalizing the war industries as thus defined would place the decisive sections of American capital under ownership of the government. It would exclude small industry, whose output for the most part did not go directly toward support of the war. Above all, it would exclude agriculture and retailing. Should questions arise with respect to firms that were not in existence in 1943–1944, or whose output has radically changed since that time, it would not be difficult to develop workable criteria to determine whether such firms ought to be nationalized. All the industries included under the general definition of war industries by nature require large aggregations of capital. If, under present conditions, they require substantial concessions in rapid amortization of capital investment, they should be nationalized. If the industry as a whole is classified as a war industry, new firms in that industry should be considered part of the general class and subject to the same policy as the entire industry.
If the copper, aluminum, steel, oil and gas mining, chemical, petroleum refining, aircraft, rubber, auto, and contract construction industries were to be nationalized, to name only the obvious, the problem of administering the war economy would be greatly simplified. The bulk of production controls would apply to government-owned industry. Control of capital investment and allocation of resources as between war and civilian purposes would not be subject to the pressures of hundreds of competing capitalists, each seeking a greater share of the market and worried lest his competitor obtain a presumed peacetime advantage. Moreover, assuming the same degree of productivity, the profits of these war industries would go to the government as the owner, thereby reducing the problem of taxation from one of major importance to a secondary problem.
Nationalization of war industries completes in its rounded economic effect the process that would be begun by a capital levy, which is by its nature a limited and temporary measure. Neither nationalization of war industries nor a capital levy are thinkable as realistic political slogans without the development of an independent labor party. Economic problems under the Permanent War Economy cannot begin to be solved except through political means. The working class is confronted with a host of tasks before it will be in a position to cope with the problems of living under the Permanent War Economy. All of them depend for solution on the ability of the American workers to achieve that political and organizational maturity that formation of an independent labor party would signify.
 
NATIONALIZATION OF WAR INDUSTRIES and A CAPITAL LEVY are the transitional slogans of the Permanent War Economy that correspond to the needs of the workers and the times. Together with traditional transitional demands that retain validity, such as Workers’ Control of Production, they can point the way toward the socialist emancipation of society. American imperialism has no perspective other than to defeat Stalinist imperialism in bloody conflict, risking in the process the atomization of all society.
The Permanent War Economy has provided capitalism with but a temporary respite, while aggravating every phase of the class struggle. There can be no rational or permanent solution to any of the basic problems that beset mankind so long as capitalism or Stalinism exist. Both require war, war preparations, and the threat of war to maintain their reactionary class rule. If the forces of the Third Camp, upon which the ultimate victory of the socialist revolution depends, appear to be weak and scattered in a world dominated by the clash of two irreconcilable imperialisms, it is well to remember that both the capitalist and Stalinist ruling classes have seen their better days.
Neither offers mankind any hope of progress toward universal freedom and a high standard of living. Aside from the stimulation of war, both serve as an actual brake upon the development of the forces of production. The historic task of the working class is to put an end to the Permanent War Economy without permitting the bourgeoisie and the Stalinists to unleash World War III.

T.N. VANCE



 
THE END




While the outcome of the Korean war remains obscure at this writing, immediate outbreak of World War III is most unlikely. Even if the major antagonists find it impossible to reach a mutually satisfactory compromise, they are unprepared for global combat. The motives that prompted Stalinist imperialism to launch the attack against South Korea on June 25, as well as the motives that led American imperialism promptly to intervene, are well known and require no further analysis here. Nor need we be particularly concerned with the resolution of the many complex political, social and economic problems arising from the liquidation of the Korean war, as these have no real strategic significance in the titanic struggle now being waged between bureaucratic collectivism (Stalinist imperialism) and capitalism (American imperialism) for control of the entire world.
It is worth noting, in passing, that the political vacuum which existed in Korea and which was in a sense responsible for the war will remain. For the war has graphically revealed that an independent political force in Korea can never be powerful enough to achieve sovereignty. A Third Camp is not and cannot exist on any consequential scale in that unfortunate Land of the Morning Calm. Like other border areas incapable of independent existence, Korea is faced with the unhappy choice of a regime propped up by American bayonets or one controlled by the Stalinist secret police.
What is important, however, for the world as a whole and for the orientation of the independent socialist movement in particular, is the perspectives that flow for the rival imperialisms once hostilities cease in Korea: Is the world to become two armed camps, waiting fearfully for the inexorable outbreak of World War III, or is some type of peace possible? Can the strategic aims of Stalinist and American imperialisms be modified in any significant degree? In a word, will the environment in which the class struggle operates differ in any noteworthy features from that which existed prior to the Korean war? And, if so, what will the consequences be and how can any such new trends be expected to manifest themselves? These are obviously crucial questions for the independent socialist movement and we shall seek to answer them in this and later articles.
The spectacle of grown men mouthing meaningless words about peace is one with which we have become all too familiar in recent years. It has become even less edifying, if that is possible, as a result of the “peace” programs set forth by Acheson and Vishinsky amid the nauseating maneuvers of the rival imperialist blocs within the United Nations. Acheson has made it plain that the only program Washington has is to arm to the hilt. Then, when parity of armed forces is achieved, “we can negotiate with the Russians.” And this is called a policy, expressed by a “responsible statesman” occupying the lofty position of Secretary of State!
To such a policy even a Vishinsky can reply with telling effect (The New York Times, October 14): “Authoritative American spokesmen say that it is only force that can impress the Soviet Union, and that when the United States is so strong as to make the Soviet Union shake in its shoes then, and only then, will it be possible to reach some understanding. What a profound and crude mistake! ... This is the policy of the diktat, the policy of pressure and imposition, the policy of demands and half-demands, repeatedly presented, pressed, bolstered and backed up by force, a proliferation of military measures, and circles of naval, land and air bases ...”
In the course of the same speech, Stalin’s Foreign Minister indicated the equally bankrupt “peace” policy of Stalinist imperialism. After complaining that “The policy (of American imperialism) has been changed ... from the wartime period of cooperation ... to the post-war ... tough policy,” Vishinsky asks, “Why do you not get back to that situation (of wartime cooperation)? If you do, things might change. I am profoundly convinced that things would change. To this thinly disguised offer of a deal; American imperialism has repeatedly given its answer: “The Soviet Government cannot be trusted to keep its word.”
Mutual recriminations about who changed which policy first only serve to conceal the basic dilemma, which explains why neither Stalinist nor American imperialism can “trust the other.” The wartime alliance between Anglo-American and Stalinist imperialisms was brought about solely due to the superior threat posed by an aggressive German imperialism under Hitler. In the absence of any such threat, it is impossible for the imperialist expressions of capitalism and bureaucratic collectivism to arrive at any lasting agreement that would permit a peaceful solution of the world’s problems.
The conflict between bureaucratic collectivism and capitalism is irrepressible. No matter what pious statements about peaceful coexistence of the two systems are issued by Moscow and Washington, they cannot disguise the fundamental antagonisms that make inevitable a clash for world supremacy. We are long accustomed to the periodic quotations from Stalin, as the occasion demands, about the “peaceful intentions of the USSR,” and (buttressed by falsified quotations from Lenin) the “possibility of peace between socialism and capitalism.”
Now we are treated to a similar disingenuous spectacle by the State Department, over which the same Acheson presides. A popular pamphlet entitled Our Foreign Policy has recently been issued. According to The New York Times of September 30, the volume constitutes a bitter indictment of Soviet policy, but it also sets out to disprove the “view that the East-West split is one between communism and capitalism.” In other words, The State Department also set out to correct what it regarded as an incorrect impression of the present tension of the world. It is not a question of differing economic systems, said the booklet, but of the threat of a new imperialist power.
“The deepening division between the Soviet-dominated bloc and the free world is not, as some people wrongly think, a conflict between capitalism and communism”, it said. “Among the nations of the free world, in fact, you will find some that are not capitalist at all, but have freely chosen a socialist system.
“The conflict is really between a power-hungry government that is bent on spreading its power by force, terror and every other means and the community of free nations which refuses to be conquered or dominated, or to stand by and see its members swallowed up.” (Italics mine – T.N.V.)
Thus, the State Department, like Vishinsky, would have us believe that all that is involved is a question of methods. That is to say, if Stalinism would relinquish its tactics of force, subversion and violence then we could have a peaceful world. It is axiomatic that methods flow from the socio-economic structure of a given state, but even if Stalinism employed “democratic” methods acceptable to Washington, American imperialism would still refuse “to stand by and see its members swallowed up.” Moreover, by this time it should be ABC, even to the State Department, that what really makes “the threat of a new imperialist power” is the existence of a new ruling class exploiting society in a new manner; namely, the social system known as bureaucratic collectivism. To be sure, this system is the antithesis of socialism and was actually brought to power by a counter-revolution that destroyed the workers state established by the Bolshevik Revolution.
Nevertheless, it is the irreconcilable antagonisms between two economic systems that have given rise to the “East-West conflict” and which threaten to lead us to World War III within the next decade. Both Moscow and Washington, at bottom, know this, although from time to time each has politically expedient reasons for issuing propaganda, designed to convey a different impression. And each has its own reasons for preparing in its own way for the inevitable showdown.
Stalinist imperialism, to which bureaucratic collectivism has given rise, is a system of slavery and peonage based on nationalized property. It is essentially an “import” imperialism whose aggressive policy is based on the economic necessity of acquiring constantly new sources of labor power; both skilled and slave, and of adding to its stock of producer and consumers goods, and which can feel safe politically only when it has integrated the major centers of world population and production into the system of bureaucratic collectivism. The Stalinist empire, as the same booklet of the State Department points out, has already enhanced its domain since the end of World War II by some 7,500,000 square miles of territory and by some 500,000,000 more people.
American imperialism, on the other hand is by far the most powerful imperialism to which finance capitalism has given birth. It is an “export” imperialism, inexorably driven by the most rapid accumulation of capital in the history of capitalism to export capital in all its forms in ever-increasing quantities. It is easy-going and bloated but it cannot be indifferent to the huge bites that Stalinism has taken out of the world market. It must first contain Stalinist imperialism and then destroy it.
In retrospect it is clear to American imperialism that it made many mistakes during the war, although the menace of German and Japanese imperialisms was immediate and real, while the danger of Stalinist imperialism was remote and at best imperfectly understood. To some extent these “mistakes” were unavoidable, for history rarely permits capitalism to function in terms of the long-run interests of the international bourgeoisie. What disturbs Washington, however, is the postwar mistake of permitting Stalin such an overwhelming head-start in the armaments race, for the curve of munitions production requires years before it generates real momentum. Indeed, it was not until 1944, despite the destruction wrought by Allied bombing, that American war production exceeded that of Nazi Germany. This lesson is well known in Washington and amounts for the unanimity that greeted the launching of the “national defense” program.
In this connection, the series of articles in The New York Times by its Moscow correspondent, Harrison E. Salisbury, is most interesting. Having just returned from a vacation in the United States, Salisbury has found Stalinland to be one of peace and growing prosperity. “The atmosphere of Moscow, and of the part of Russia that I crossed in traveling here from Poland,” he says, “is not one of war nor of preparation for war.” He concludes his dispatch of October 13 by stating: “What is interesting about the Soviet situation is that as of today, so far as research can determine, there has been no substantial changeover of the economy from its predominantly peacetime aspect to one of preparation for, or anticipation of, war.”
We do not wish to impugn Mr. Salisbury’s research abilities, or even the facilities made available to him in conducting his research, but the timing of the articles invites the suspicion that they were inspired by more than reportorial zeal and the conclusion is demonstrably false. The facts have nothing to do with atmosphere, which may well be as reported, but if Moscow today has a “predominantly peacetime aspect” it can only be because the normal face of Stalinism is one of a Permanent War Economy. The maintenance of 300 divisions, even it all are not at full wartime strength, the arming of the satellites, the military-technological development of strategic roads, canals, railroads, airports and other means of communication and transportation within the satellite countries, the expansion of the Soviet Navy, especially the submarine fleet, the feverish development of uranium mines, etc., etc., are an indisputable evidence of a war economy.
Since statistics are a “class science” in Stalinland, we cannot say what the precise percentage of the national product spent for war purposes is, but at a guess we would place it in the neighborhood of 25 per cent. Since during the last war only about 50 per cent of the national product was devoted by the Soviet Government to direct war outlays, such a reduction coupled with the fruits of imperialist acquisition and increasing production could well result in some improvement in civilian standards of living. The important point is that for Stalinism the shift from “peace” to “war” is only quantitative, not qualitative, and can be accomplished without upsetting normal routines, either politically or economically.
Moreover, while the ultimate aim of Stalinist imperialist strategy is conquest of the entire world, the immediate aims are clearly more limited. Time, the Kremlin feels, is on its side. It must complete the process of integrating the economics of existing satellites into its own. It needs another five-year plan or perhaps two, to increase its production and military potential to the desired level of overwhelming superiority, not to mention atomic equality. It must overthrow Tito and eliminate Titoism, in which objective it may have been mightily aided by the recent drought in Yugoslavia that, at last report, has destroyed some 4,000,000 tons of foodstuffs. Then must come the closing of the pincers on India and, choicest morsel of all, acquisition of all of Germany.
The air of confidence and tranquillity with which Stalinist spokesmen face the future is therefore much more than a mere propaganda “trick,” a so-called “peace offensive” to lull the decadent democracies into lowering their armed guard so that they will be an easy prey for a sudden onslaught. Stalin would welcome a deal with American imperialism, provided that it did not materially weaken his chances of obtaining control of the entire vast Eurasian heartland, for this is the realistic strategic objective of Stalinist imperialism in the next decade. The Stalinist ruling class has everything to gain by postponing the final battle with American imperialism, or so it reasons.
Two aspects of current American imperialist policy are most noteworthy. Internally, there is minimal unanimity within the American bourgeoisie regarding the fundamentals of imperialist strategy. The Truman policy of containment of Stalinist imperialism, which is the essential meaning of all major steps in foreign policy in recent years, may be criticized as to the manner in which it has been carried out but it is rare indeed that anyone seeks to change the objective or, the major strategy adopted to achieve this basic purpose. This is reflected in domestic politics by the extreme weakness of the isolationist fringe, an obvious but nonetheless significant difference from the post-World War I situation. It is apparent that all major tendencies within American imperialism are clearly aware that it would be fatal to permit Stalinist imperialism to control all of Europe and Asia, from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Indian oceans, for if Stalinist imperialism controlled three-fourths of the world’s population an insoluble political problem is presented even if in the long run a military victory under such adverse conditions may still be possible.
Externally, despite the establishment of the so-called Stettin-Trieste line and the attempts to establish a comparable demarcation line in Asia, American imperialism has clearly been on the defensive. It is Stalinist imperialism that selects the area and methods of struggle and American imperialism that replies with a thoroughly improvised policy. Because these tactical methods are either generally unsuccessful or incapable of achieving any lasting victory, which is more or less inevitable in view of American imperialism’s inability to solve any conflict on other than military terms, there is dissatisfaction with and criticism of specific tactics. This tactical opposition has combined with mounting economic pressures to establish the policy of containing Stalinist imperialism through the mobilization of superior armed force. From parity, which will be impossible to measure, to superiority of armed forces, which may not be easy to achieve, to World War III, which may be difficult to win, is the road on which American imperialism has definitely embarked.
Korea exploded the fallacy that American imperialism could contain Stalinist imperialism through speeches and a business-as-usual (i.e., a defensive) policy. For a brief flurry it almost gave rise to its diametric opposite, the policy of the direct offensive which meant seeking immediately a purely military victory over Stalinist imperialism. This, in essence, is the position of the advocates of a “preventive” war and all variations thereof. We do not for one moment exclude the possibility that American imperialism can defeat Stalinist imperialism in an all-out war, featured especially by use of the atomic bomb, but such a military victory would be politically disastrous. It is most unlikely, moreover, that the struggle would be short or easy. On the contrary, all available evidence points to a protracted war between two fairly evenly matched antagonists. The consequent economic destruction and totalitarianization of American political life, without even considering the impact on the rest of the world, would make any military victor; absolutely worthless. Such a policy then can be only a last resort, to be embraced only if there is no other hope for survival of the American capitalist class.
Faced with the failure of the previous “defensive” policy and the impossibility of adopting an overwhelmingly “aggressive” policy, the American bourgeoisie has finally reached a policy that in political terms can best be described as “Neither Peace nor War”. And is literally true that they do not want peace and cannot afford war with Stalinism! To be sure, American imperialism cannot mobilize the support of the international proletariat, as Trotsky hoped to do when he advanced the identical slogan on the occasion of the Brest Litovsk discussions, but it can hope to mobilise what is left of the international bourgeoisie.
The policy of “Neither Peace Nor War” will gain time, unless of course Stalinist imperialism reacts by casting the die for immediate war. This is most unlikely for reasons cited earlier. Naturally, if war does take place within the next few years, then the present breathing spell will have been utilized to overcome the Stalinist headstart in armaments production, or at least to reduce the present disparity, thereby enhancing the prospects of American imperialism for military victory. Above all, allies will be sought and armed in all areas of the world not under the control of Stalinist imperialism. This is, of course, the real meaning of the Atlantic Pact and related policies. The process of reducing British, French and other Western European imperialisms to the position of satellites dependent upon military and economic aid from the United States is a complicated one and takes time. It takes even more time to revive and harness the military power of defeated German and Japanese imperialisms. American imperialism would also like to have the time to conquer the markets of the disintegrating British Empire and to solve a series of other economic problems arising out of the pressure of the most rapid accumulation of capital in the history of the world.
This ambivalent policy is not without its dangers, but there is no alternative for American imperialism. It even contains the hope that the death of Stalin may precipitate a struggle for succession that will greatly weaken or even destroy Stalinist imperialism. Mr Hoffman of ECA fame is fond of speculating on such a turn of events, and it is said that this is one of the reasons he opposed the militarization of the Marshall Plan which presumably led to his resignation.
No better illustration of the significance of the new policy can be found than in what has happened to the Marshall Plan. Although in the interests of American imperialism, and part of the policy of Stalinist containment, it did nevertheless eschew military policies and it had make some progress toward improving standards of living in Western Europe and achieving a more rational and integrated economy. Now all this has been abandoned under the impact of the mobilization program. As The New York Times correspondent, Michael L. Hoffman, expresses it in his dispatch published on October 13 “Time and again in the past few weeks this correspondent has heard. European economic officials of various nationalities say with an actual or figurative shrug of the shoulders that as the United States seemed to have lost interest in everything except rearmament each country had better start looking out after itself in economic matters.” (My italics – T.N.V.) In fact, the article was headlined “Europe’s economy edges to autarchy.”
The political reception that the new American policy has received in Europe and Asia, especially Asia, is anything but favorable. But it is its economic causes and effects that are the key to the shape of the world after the end of the Korean war.
The immediate origin of the economic pressures that have pushed American imperialism into its new course, which is without historical precedent for a democratic capitalist nation, lies in the phenomenal expansion of the productive forces during World War II and the virtual maintenance of this level of production during the last five years. This development has not only been contrary to the expectations of the bourgeoisie but also, let us admit, unexpected by most Marxists. Here our analysis will be helped by making reference to some statistical measures, even if they are considered as but crude approximations.
We start with the fact that production increased about 12 per cent a year during World War II, from 1939 to 1945. In other words, total output was some 72 per cent higher when the war ended than when it began. This can be seen by examining the figures for national income and national product of the Department of Commerce as published in the Survey of Current Business (the latest revisions are contained in the issue of July 1950).

* Calculated by deflating the 1945 current dollar figures by the rise in the BLS
 wholesale price index, which rose from 77.1 in 1939 to 106.3 In 1945 – a rise of
37.2 per cent yielding a deflator of 27.1 per cent.




National income and product figures are, of course, estimates, but they are the only dollar figures that attempt to portray the productive performance of the economy. Without entering into current controversies among the national income specialists, and, granting that important conceptual and statistical problems are involved, we are concerned only with basic trends which are not altered even if the margin of error in the figures is sizable. Fundamentally, gross national product is larger than net national product by the inclusion of capital depreciation and depletion. That is, the net value of current production ought not to include the consumption of capital as this is already reflected in the final prices of commodities on the market. Net national product is larger than national income chiefly due to the inclusion of indirect business taxes and liabilities, i.e., sales and excise taxes, etc., thus affecting the evaluation of government services.
We have based our conclusion about the Wartime growth of output on gross national product because, while the BLS wholesale price index is the best single indicator of price changes throughout the economy, it undoubtedly understates to some extent the degree of wartime inflation. A sounder procedure would have been to deflate separately each component of gross national product, but the work involved would not be justified by appreciably greater accuracy in the results. And for our purposes it is of relatively minor importance whether real output increased by 60 per cent, 70 per cent or 80 per cent during the war.
As a matter of fact, the federal reserve index of industrial production, which is based on physical volume, tends to confirm our analysis. This index, by for the most comprehensive of all industrial production indexes, rose from 109 in 1939 to 203 in 1945, a rise of 86 per cent. The Federal Reserve index, however, definitely overstates as a measure of total output in wartime because of weight assigned to war industries in its composition.
We are therefore content to rest with the figure of 72 per cent as the wartime increase in total output. How was this huge increase in production achieved? Initial impetus, of course, was provided by the availability of significant quantities of idle resources, including over nine million unemployed. There then occurred a surprising increase in the total employed labor force which, including both the civilian and armed force sectors, rose from over 45 million in 1939 to about 64 million in 1915, a rise of roughly 40 per cent. Even without the armed forces of almost 12 million, the employed civilian labor force still rose by about seven million workers, who worked for longer hours and whose productivity was increased by a huge expansion in productive capacity largely as a result of the enormous government expenditures for plant and equipment. In other words, the wartime expansion in real output was made possible essentially by an increase in capital accumulation and in the supply of labor power, in roughly equal proportions.
Had the wartime increase in the total labor force largely evaporated with the cessation of hostilities and had the wartime increase in capital been totally unsuited for peacetime use or, to the extent that it was unadaptable, had it not been substantially replenished by new, peacetime accumulations of capital, the level of activity of the economy would have reverted to prewar output, with consequent depressing effects. This did not occur, contrary to many expectations, because government expenditures were maintained at high levels, partly for war purposes, and American imperialism decided to support the recovery of the economics of Western Europe as part of the policy of containment of Stalinist imperialism and as a means of increasing the market for products of American capitalism. The entire process, of course, was nourished by the backlog accumulated backlog of consumer demands in the domestic market which, in turn, were supported by the tremendous level of private savings.
The same procedure that was used to calculate the wartime increase in output shows that postwar output is currently almost the levels achieved at the end of the war. It is true that our calculations yield an 18 per cent decline in real output in last five years, but the decline in the last four years is only 5 per cent. In other words, more than two-thirds the relatively small decline that has occurred took place in 1946, in the first postwar year before the menace of Stalinist imperialism became apparent to the leaders of the American bourgeoisie. Perhaps a planned reconversion would have averted the decline of 1946 best it must be remembered that the dominant elements within American capitalism at that time were bating all their plans and policies on a return to the status quo ante bellum.
It must be emphasized that the achievement of these extremely high levels of production occurred prior to the outbreak of the Korean war. For example, the Federal Reserve index was at 201 in July 1950 compared with 203 in 1945. Since then it has risen sharply, but at that level it is 14 per cent above 1949 and 5 per cent above 1948, the previous postwar peak. The labor force data show that the war-time peaks have been equaled. For June 1950 the employed civilian labor force was estimated (September 1950 issue of Monthly Labor Review) at 61,482,000. When the derived armed forces figure of 1,311,000 is added to this figure, the total employed labor force becomes 62,793,000 or close to the 64 minion figure reached in war time. There is, of course, the vast difference that the wartime figure included 12 million in the armed forces whereas the current pre-Korean armed forces figure is only slightly over 1,300,000. In other words, more than 9 million have been added to the employed civilian labor force since the end of World War II. These figures help to explain why Washington is so concerned about manpower shortages as the mobilization program unfolds, but they also reveal, in spite of the shorter work week, a goodly portion of the reason why postwar output has been maintained at almost wartime levels.
The other part of the postwar story of high level production and employment is to be found in the extremely rapid rate of private capital accumulation, the figures for which are even more pregnant with meaning for the future than the manpower data. The tabulation, based on the Department of Commerce data, graphically reveals the picture:

Thus, in the five postwar years American capitalists have accumulated on gross basis about 195 billion dollars, or an average of 39 billion dollars annually. This represents about 16 per cent of the postwar annual gross national product, a truly staggering percentage, especially when we remember that this growth in capital accumulation occurred with the economy already operating at peak levels due to the war.
If we wish to measure the net addition to private capital formation (i.e., the net additions to plant, equipment, construction, and business inventories, or constant capital as Marx would have put it), we have to subtract the postwar consumption of capital from gross private domestic investment. This is a field in which the experts always disagree as it involves depreciation, treatment of business reserves and accounting practices. It is clear that the maximum it can be, using the Department of Commerce figures, is the difference between what is termed “net national product” and “gross national product,” or about $83 billion. This would mean an average postwar annual capital consumption of over $16 billion, which appears to be excessive, and is accounted for not only by the rapid amortisation that was permitted of wartime plants but by the inclusion of “statistical discrepancies” and other uncertain quantities in the figures. It is noteworthy, however, that even on a net basis without any adjustment the annual rate of capital investment in the postwar period is 10 per cent, a rate that has not taken place in peacetime since the 1920’s. With proper adjustments, the percentage of net capital formation to net national product would appear to be about 12 per cent annually, which even exceeds the period 1919-1923, the five years following World War I.
All current reports testify to this accumulation of capital, the material base for American imperialism. For example, a report of the Securities and Exchange Commission for the second quarter of 1956, which is summarized in The New York Times of October 12, states “that the net working capital of United States corporations reached $73,800,000,000 at the end of June.” No wonder, then, that a National Association of Manufacturers analysis of the postwar financing of business, the findings of which are summarized in The New York Times of October 16, is able to state: “Retained earnings were an important source of new capital,” although this admission is then qualified, “but this resulted from a relatively low level of dividends rather than from high profits.” We would not expect the NAM ever to admit that business is making “high profits,” but without passing judgment on current arguments between management and stockholders as to the proper distribution of profits, the fact of the matter is that American business has never accumulated such profits as it has in the postwar period.
It is precisely the record accumulation of capital that makes so interesting the figures for the “net foreign investment” component of national product. Net foreign investment represents the net changes in claims against foreign countries and is affected principally by the net private balance of foreign trade and the net flow of long-term capital abroad. Thus, in the words of the August 1950 Survey of Current Business, “The negative balance of net foreign investment – arising from the substantial excess of Government grants over the current export surplus – remained for the second quarter of the year at approximately $2 billion, at an annual rate.”
While perhaps too much significance should not be attributed to the absolute figures, the trend – rapidly accelerating after the end of the war through 1947 and rapidly reversing itself from 1943 to the present – portrays the entire tragedy of modern capitalism in the constriction of the market and a paucity of opportunities for profitable foreign investment of surplus capital. The most recent figures on the net outflow of private long-term capital show the pathetically low levels to which American imperialism has sunk (from the September 1950 issue of the Survey of Current Business):

In other words, a mere 14 million dollars represents the total net export of capital by American imperialism during the past year. For the same period, the net outflow of Government long-term capital amounted to $162 million, or 25 per cent of the private total. Even on a gross basis, discounting the total inflow of capital into America from abroad, the private total for the past year is only $1,434,000,000.
With capital accumulation proceeding at the all-time record rates described above, it is clear that the point where the American economy would be choked by surplus capital was rapidly being approached. The Point Four program, in particular, has been designed to establish a climate favorable to the investment of American capital abroad, but Truman has turned out to be just as fortunate as Roosevelt in the matter of having an aggressive foreign imperialism turn up at just the right time to make all sections of the American bourgeoisie unite in supporting an expanding program.
War outlays will more than substitute for the inadequacies of the Point Four program. They will relieve a number of economic and political pressures, although in turn creating others. Just how high they will go remains to be seen, but Secretary of the Navy Matthews is reported in The New York Times of October 13 as saying, “The cost of operating the national military establishment alone next year might exceed this year’s entire national budget: That would be more $42,000,000,000.” There will, of course, be differences of opinion within the ruling class as to the degree of preparation that is required. And it makes quite a difference to many industries and many sections of the capitalist class whether, say, 10 per cent or 25 per cent of the national product is devoted to direct war outlays.
An interesting statement of the perspective involved was made recently by Francis Adams Truslow, president of the New York Curb Exchange, as reported in The New York Times of September 23: “This war, or time of preparation, is not a specific all-out effort, but is perhaps almost a new way of living which we must endure indefinitely.” (My italics – T.N.V.) It should not escape our attention that this “new way of living” will operate on a world scale and that it is only another name for what we have called the Permanent War Economy. Its nature and impact are of the greatest importance, but will require a separate article or articles to analyze in any meaningful form.
T.N. Vance



What has happened to the recent strikes of the French workers against the extension of the working week to 48 hours by the Daladier Government? Two weeks ago the red flag was reported waving over factories in Amiens, a general strike of the 50,000 textile workers was threatening and the Marseilles dock workers were conducting a two-month-old militant strike. Has the French government used the international crisis to mobilize its war apparatus, calling the workers to the colors and thus putting an end to the strike movement? We do know that the National Committee of the C.G.T. (trade union federation) has approved the national defense plans of the bourgeoisie.
The contrast between the morale of the French proletariat today and last year, between the course of the class struggle today and a year ago, is really amazing. Gone is the enthusiasm, spirit and militancy of the French workers. In its place reigns discouragement, disinterestedness in politics, and all the obvious characteristics of a period of social reaction. The miserable showing of July 14 was one example. The steady drift of the workers away from the C.G.T. (General Confederation of Labor) is obviously proof of the reaction.
It is easy to read the minds of these workers. They say to themselves: “We had everything. Now we have nothing. We cannot even trust our leaders. Daladier does not represent the People’s Front. Maybe the People’s Front is no good. What can we do? We might just as well enjoy ourselves in the short time that remains before we have to fight against Hitler.” This reaction and chauvinistic sweep is, of course, the logical fruit of the People’s Front. But the French proletariat does not, as a whole, yet understand this elementary truth.
It is easy for us to trace the origin and course of this reaction, because we predicted it. It is not so easy to estimate the extent and duration of the reaction. That depends on too many variable factors. True, there is certainly a legitimate economic base for a strike wave at present. But are the present strikes merely the tail-end of the whole preceding period of sharp class struggles, the last desperate gestures on the part of the leaderless workers before the vise of the reaction clamps down completely? Or, on the contrary, do these strikes mark the end of the reaction and the beginnings of a desperate upsurge on the part of the working class? A third element, which cannot be neglected, is the possibility that (as was the case in April of this year when the Blum government fell and the Daladier government came into power) the Communist Party is principally responsible for the strikes.
 
The Hand of the C.P.
That the C.P. is the driving force behind the strikes may seem strange, but not if one knows what has been happening recently. We know that the Stalinists did not hesitate to use the magnificent strike action of the French proletariat as blackmail against the French bourgeoisie when they thought that the formation of the Daladier government meant the abandonment of the Franco-Soviet pact and the entry of France into the politics of the Four-Power bloc. We know, too, that the 73 deputies of the C.P. voted for Daladier only on the basis of an agreement that no open steps would be taken by the French bourgeoisie to break the Franco-Soviet Pact during the summer period. If, as is quite, possible the British-French “sell-out” of Czechoslovakia is to be used as a step towards the formation of a Four-Power pact, then the motivation for previous Stalinist-in spired strikes and for the reported present opposition of the C.P. to the Daladier government is definitely understandable.
Aside from the possible repercussions of the international situation upon French domestic affairs, there is, however, another reason which might cause one to suspect the Stalinists. For the past four or five months there has been a steady drift of the French workers away from the C.P. and its periphery apparatus This has been part of, and one of the signs of, the general reaction. Numerically, the C.P. has compensated for these defections to a certain extent by extending its base amongst the petty-bourgeoisie, intellectual and lumpen elements. The bureaucracy, however, knows that not only will they not be able to exert any pressure on the French bourgeoisie if they continue to lose their working-class following, but also that not all the workers who leave their ranks will retire into political inactivity. Some will find their way to the revolutionary ranks, the Fourth International. Hence, in order to keep their following, the Stalinists are forced into action.
 
Economic Battles Inevitable
In spite of all the variable factors which play a part in the present struggle in France, and which are so difficult to estimate precisely, it is absolutely inevitable that the present reaction and general discouragement amongst the workers must give way to stormy battles either in the immediate present or in the very near future, unless war intervenes. The economic struggle alone, that is the general and rapid worsening of the living standards of the masses, is forcing the French working class once again onto the path of extra-parliamentary action. A pre-revolutionary situation goes through many ups and downs before the final crisis is reached, but inevitably it merges into a revolutionary crisis.
Whether the progressive elements in the C.G.T. will succeed in calling an extraordinary congress to prepare for the present struggles remains to be seen. The French workers still have time to prepare for their decisive battles these decisive battles might take place before, during or after the war), but their time is becoming increasingly short. The People’s Front has not only wasted valuable time in the last two years, but it has also, while entrenching the reaction, disarmed the workers ideologically, weakened their fighting organizations, criminally sabotaged the struggle in the colonies and placed the officers’ corps (solidly fascist) in a commanding position. What were once very favorable conditions for a revolution in France have become definitely less favorable, due especially to the betrayal of the workers by their leaders.
One thing, however, which must not be overlooked is that the French working class has a long and militant tradition of class struggle behind it. It is definitely anti-fascist. This, of course, is to guarantee that fascism will not triumph in France, but it gives the revolutionary forces an advantage. The fascist movement itself has not grown and, as a matter of fact, has had great difficulty in maintaining its positions. All forces, from extreme left to extreme right, recognize the gravity of the present situation in France, and intimate that they expect decisive battles in the fall.
The present Daladier government will surely fall then, although it is not excluded that Daladier himself will again be chosen to head the new cabinet, this time possibly a national union government. One gets the feeling, however, from a stay in France that, in spite of everything, the biggest unknown factor is what will the French workers do. It is the French working class which will have the decisive say in the coming momentous battles in France, and it is here that the great opportunity for the P.O.I. (French section of the Fourth International) lies.
 



PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia, Aug. 10. – This magnificent city, the juncture between East and West, has been literally overwhelmed by an influx of newspaper correspondents since the beginning of this month – the occasion, of course, being the arrival of Lord Runciman and his entourage. On the surface, Prague is calm; the people do not seem unduly excited in view of the critical situation. They know, at least, that regardless of the results of Runciman’s mission, there will be no war while Runciman is here, so they calmly pursue the even tenor of their ways, take vacations, sip their beer in the many pleasant cafes and talk – mainly of the Russo-Japanese situation, rather than of Runciman and Hitler, whom they would like to forget.
The experienced observer, however, is not fooled by the easy-going disposition of the Czechs. There are countless bits of evidence which reveal the tension beneath the surface and explain the highly surcharged atmosphere of Prague, when compared with London or Paris. One can stroll any evening down the stately Vaclavske, Prague’s Broadway and Fifth Avenue, and notice the number of soldiers who walk briskly past, saluting each other. The population, from capitalist to worker, eyes them with pride. One can almost read behind the gleam in their eyes their obvious thoughts: “There go our soldiers. Look how strong and well-trained they are. If Hitler thinks that he will take Czechoslovakia like he took Austria, he is making a big mistake. We will fight, everyone of us; and our army, almost a million strong, is the best-equipped in the world.” How many times now have I heard such thoughts from the lips of various people, representing every social strata and class!
 
Speak No German
It is obvious that an intense wave of nationalism and patriotism has swept over this small, elongated state, artificially created by the Treaty of Versailles, and now already half inside the jaws of Hitler’s Greater Germany. Instances are too numerous to mention, but one made a profound impression upon me. I knew that Czechoslovakian is a Slavic language and would be so much gibberish to me, but I did not anticipate any language difficulties as I took it for granted that almost everyone in Prague would speak German. Time after time German drew no response at all. Finally, I asked a comrade to explain this. He replied: “Oh, yes! Most Czechs speak German, but they will not do so nowadays if they can avoid it.”
The reasons for this chauvinistic sweep are not hard to find. Hitler’s annexation of Austria made the Czech bourgeoisie realize that they were next. Relatively far more powerful and clever than the Austrian bourgeoisie, the Czech bourgeoisie was determined to fight for the preservation of their internal imperialist domain, the right to exploit the nine millions of Germans, Slovaks, Ruthenians, Hungarians, etc., who comprise a definite majority of the total population of 15,000,000. When the general mobilization was called on May 21, there were many misgivings in foreign capitals, even, it is rumored, in the Presidential Palace. Only the General Staff of the Army was confident that the mobilization could be achieved. They knew the strength and training of the army, and the superiority that the famous Skoda munitions works gave them. It turned out to be a master stroke. Everything went off like clockwork. In some towns in the Sudeten areas when soldiers began to appear, they thought it must be the advance guard of Hitler’s legions The Henleinists turned out to welcome them, only to be immediately disillusioned. Hitler took pause and decided that that was not the moment. The result was to raise Czech patriotism to a feverish pitch.
 
Class Lines Forgotten
But far more important than the strategy and propaganda of the bourgeoisie in the development of the nationalistic spirit here has been the complete degeneration and capitulation of the mass workers’ organizations, the Communist Party, the Social Democracy and the trade unions. They have completely solidarized themselves with Benes in an unwritten People’s Front and, with the exception of the German Social-Democratic Party (in Sudeten Czechoslovakia), have abandoned even making a pretext to fight for the self-determination of the national minorities.
While the Stalinist apparatus is concentrated in Prague, having nothing at all in the Sudeten areas, its 40,000 members wield a far greater influence proportionately than the 180,000 members of the Czech Social Democratic Party and the 40,000 German-speaking Social Democrats. It is important to note, however, that while the Stalinist influence is on the increase, it is largely amongst the intelligentsia and the petty-bourgeoisie. Prague is already the second (next to Spain) largest concentration point of the G.P.U., outside of Russia, and the gangster apparatus, although a present quiet, is waiting for the time when it will be more politic for it to move more openly and freely.
In fact, it is only the small voice of the Fourth International that is raised here against the dictatorial war plans of Czechoslovakia and the chauvinistic poison that has been injected into the bloodstream of the proletariat by these so-called workers’ leaders.
 
Economic Crisis
The present crisis is equally re vealed, although perhaps not so dramatically, in the economic field. True, the two gigantic enterprises of Czechoslovakia, the Skoda munitions works and the Bata shoe factories, are still showing profits, but at a diminished rate. The currency is depreciated, the Czech kronen being placed in the category of the “blocked currencies,” along with the German mark and the Italian lire. This makes it quite advantageous for foreigners to visit but in spite of this the tourist trade of Czechoslovakia, which annually draws hundreds of thousands to its famous baths, has dwindled to practically nothing, and most of the baths are closed.
Unemployment is increasing steadily, and the government has made absolutely no provision for relief. “Join the army or starve” is, in reality, the slogan of this “democratic” government; and of course, neither the C.P., S.P nor trade unions lift a finger in defense of the unemployed. As a matter of fact, the trade unions controlled by the Social Democracy, do not even exercise the strength which their number permit them, working hours being very long and wages low. The average Czech worker earns about $5.00 a week; Czechoslovakia may be a tourist’s paradise but hardly a worker’s. In true Rooseveltian Popular Front style the entire burden of the crisis and the war preparations is placed on the backs of the workers.
What will Runciman do? This question I have propounded to many workers. Invariably they reply: “I don’t know. We hope for the best, but we do not expect anything from him.” In this, the Czech workers show admirable good sense and a healthy distrust for the chicanery of British diplomacy. The newspaper correspondents are beginning to chafe at the lack of news, but those on the inside predict that these conversations of Runciman will bring the Henleinists and the Government together over the same table, the object being a formula which will appease the situation for a time, as the notorious lag in England’s rearmament has even handicapped her in trying to achieve the Four-Power Pact. The difficulties are many.
 
Believe War Inevitable
England has no qualms about giving Hitler Sudeten Czechoslovakia. After all, it doesn’t belong to her, but it must be done “peacefully.” That requires time. Can Hitler wait a year to carry out the policy of peaceful penetration that is to be proposed? Moreover, while the Czech government is quite willing to grant the Nazis almost a free hand in the municipal administrations in the Sudeten area, such proposals will weaken their authority considerably, and they have already indicated that they will insist that control of the police, army and financial departments in the Sudeten cities remain in their hands. Whether Runciman can find a formula (and any formula must be at the expense of Czechoslovakia) that will be agreeable to both Henlein and Benes remains to be seen. The population here is skeptical, but in any case it believes that war is inevitable, and sooner rather than later.
Meanwhile, absolutely no steps are taken by the government to arm the workers or to solve the nationalistic problem in an effective manner. Nor can any capitalist government do so, without unleashing a workers’ revolution. It is this that the Fourth International realizes, but which the Czech workers do not yet realize. The instinctive hatred of the workers for Hitler is legitimate and progressive. But they must be made to realize, as the new united organ of the Fourth International, Proletarske Noviny, points out that Hitler cannot be defeated, nor the independence of Czechoslovakia maintained, without at the same time pursuing an intransigent policy of class struggle against the Czech bourgeoisie. Only a workers’ state, part of the United Socialist States of Europe, can save Czechoslovakia.
 



Who Pays?
“We have just begun to rearm. There must be a higher debt limit and new taxes.”
So said Secretary of Treasury, Mr. Morgenthau, two days after Roosevelt was re-elected for a third term. Conservative estimates indicate that the government will spend at least 20 billion dollars during the next year and a half. This is a lot of money, no matter how one looks at it. It amounts to about 30% of the of the current national income.
We know how Germany is financing the war – by increasing the working day to 12 and 14 hours, speeding up labor, higher taxes that fall most heavily on the masses of the people, by looting the occupied territories through a system of scientific stealing – in two words, by a system of forced labor. A totalitarian regime is well equipped for this method. The institution of an extremely rigid type of capitalist slavery is the fundamental reason why fascism came to power.
 
The Lesson of England
How is the war financed in England, a democratic capitalist country? Does England, which claims to be fighting a war for democracy, finance the war in a more democratic way possible, by having those most able to pay for themselves cost of the war (about 36 million dollars daily)? Are the standards of living of the English masses maintained? the answer is very definitely, no! The London Economist’s index of British prices on Nov. 5, 1940 was about 42% higher than at the outbreak of the war. In spite of higher taxes, the British capitalist is finding the war very profitable, aside from those whose plants have been destroyed by bombings – and these will probably be reimbursed by the government. Conservative bourgeois sources indicate that the average standard of living of the British worker (aside from those rendered homeless by bombings) has declined about one-third since the outbreak of the war. In both England and Germany, the masses are bearing the burden of World War II, thus destroying a lot of the fake pretexts given for the war. Must we expect the same sort of thing in this country? The opinion of London financial circles is very interesting, in view of the experience the British have had with this problem.
“It is felt,” says a dispatch to the New York Times, dated Nov. 10, “that the New Deal policies will be pushed into the background by more urgent requirements of rearmament and even larger United States backing for the British war effort. It is remarked by commentators in the financial press that the urgency of the production drive entails on Mr. Roosevelt the necessity of treating big business more gently than hitherto.”
 
Workers Will Pay
Comment on this is really superfluous. The British capitalists need not fear for their American brethren. Roosevelt does not need their advice. He has already taken the necessary steps to make sure that the American workers pay for the cost of rearmament. When the “defense” program was first projected earlier this year, Roosevelt indicated very clearly how he was going to handle the problem of paying for the cost of the program by broadening the base of the income tax, so that those in the lower income brackets, who have hitherto been exempt, will now pay an income tax. The rates have been stepped up so that the workers and lower middle classes will pay proportionately much more than previously. Special “national defense” taxes were levied on amusements, movies, gasoline, liquor and tobacco, which, of course, fall most heavily on the masses. Government employees will pay both a state and federal income tax.
Now that the election is over, the program is unfolded in all its reactionary splendor. Most of the money, it seems, is to be raised by increasing the national debt limit to $60,000,000,000 (it is now 45 billions). This, as Wall Street correctly interpreted, is a measure with inflationary tendencies. “I have no fear of inflation now that President Roosevelt is back,” says the eminent Secretary of Treasury, but just why Roosevelt should be any better able to prevent rising prices than Churchill, he does not indicate. Without the introduction of prices, which mean a lower standard of living for the masses, are inevitable.
 
The Tax Swindle
It is also indicated that a small portion of the money will be raised by new taxes. I have already indicated in a previous article, that the excess profits tax is a swindle and will raise very little. What new taxes are meant? The only one indicated is a proposal to tax government bonds, which are now tax exempt.
This explains why the banks and big corporations have been getting rid of their government bonds during the past few months. Some money will undoubtedly be raised by this method, but we can expect that it will be chiefly through another Liberty Loan campaign, which means that the lower middle classes and higher-paid workers will bear the brunt of the patriotic salesmanship pressure. Other taxes, since present measures are obviously inadequate to cover the cost of the program, will most likely be forthcoming. Our experiences to date, however, indicate that it is “we, the little people,” who will pay for them. Since the squeeze on the government’s finances will become tighter and tighter, no matter how much the normal revenue from taxation is increased due to a higher national income, we can expect also that very shortly Roosevelt will begin to listen to Senator Byrd and others who propose that “we should at once economize on non-essential peacetime spending.” By “non-essential” spending, these people, of course, mean WPA, slum-clearance and the like. As long as Roosevelt refuses to make those who can afford to pay for the “defense” program, it’s a cinch that the workers and broad masses will bear the brunt of the rearmament program. And why, indeed, should it be any different here than in England or Germany?

Who Profits?
“The profits of twenty-eight steel companies for the first nine months of 1940 were $169,919,408, compared with $54,606,254 in the same period in 1939, despite the fact that tax appropriations for the current year were virtually double those in the comparable period. The increase amounts to 211% for the nine months.”
The above quotation, from an article in the financial section of the New York Times on Nov. 10, gives the answer to our question. It merely gives actual figures for a generally-observed situation. Business is booming. Production levels will probably exceed 1929 levels for 1940. Profits will be very close to 1929 profits.
It is estimated that profits for all industry will reach the total of 10 billion dollars in 1940. (Why not just take all of this – if rearming is what the bosses want!) America has definitely entered upon an armaments boom, which will be much, much greater during 1941 than even during 1940. The only difference between the present boom and the 1929 boom, aside from the fact that an armaments boom is never very sound or lasting, is that most of the big profits are made by even fewer of the big corporations. In the case of the steel profits cited above, for example, 12 steel leaders made net profits of $157,341,000 during the first nine months of 1940. The other 16 steel companies made only 12½ millions – enough to keep the wolf away from the door, but chicken feed compared to the money made by U.S. Steel, Bethlehem, Republic, Weir’s National Steel, and the other big steel corporations.
 
Prosperity for Rich
The same story is true in auto, rubber, oil and the other mass production industries. Prosperity has arrived for America’s 60 families and their friends. Chemical, aviation, shipbuilding and munitions factories are working 24 hours a day. Orders are piled up for a year or two in advance. And most of this increase in production is being accomplished with relatively little increase in the number of workers hired. The investments in plant and equipment are so large that most of these industries will pay hardly and excess profits tax. Anti-trust laws and prosecutions against big business monopolies are being suspended in the interests of “national defense.”
 
Labor’s Opportunity
Here it would seem, lies the big opportunity for America’s trade unions, especially the CIO, which has most of the unions in the mass production industries, to demand substantial wage increases. Industry cannot justifiably raise the argument that it cannot “afford” higher wages and better working conditions. The figures show otherwise. Moreover, in spite of the organization drives of the CIO, these industries are still largely unorganized. Those that are organized, however, are making just as big profits as those that are unorganized. Just compare U.S. Steel, which is organized, with Bethlehem and Little Steel which are unorganized. Or, General Motors with Ford. Or, the independent oil companies with Standard Oil.
This is labor’s big opportunity. Failure to take advantage of it, however, will mean not only the death of certain unions, but it will mean that big business with its reactionary social program, will be more firmly in the saddle than ever. Wartime prosperity has, in the past, usually been accompanied by increased labor organization and the growth of the trade union movement. But that was in the period of expanding capitalism.
The present period, in spite of the war-time boom, is a period of declining capitalism. The bosses will fight even more desperately, therefore, against any attempts at organization by labor. The union movement, under pressure from the unorganized workers and the rank and file of labor, in general, will be compelled in the interests of self-preservation to widen and strengthen its efforts at organization. It will run smack up against the cry, “If you strike, you are interfering with national defense.” And this, at a time when big capital is writing its own ticket as to the terms on which it will cooperate with the rearmament program. The battle to organize the mass production industries, especially the key “defense” industries like aviation, chemicals, munitions and ship-building, will, through its outcome, determine in large part the future of this country.
If the unions fail to measure up to the responsibility that is theirs, even such labor standards and unions as exist now will be destroyed. If, on the other hand, the unions succeed in defending and advancing the basic economic rights of labor, then we will have taken a long step forward in the struggle to maintain our elementary rights, and, ultimately, to advance towards a socialist society.
 



When Wall Street’s white hope, Republican presidential nominee Wendell L. Willkie, rushed into print a few weeks ago to denounce the Overton-Russell amendment to the conscription bill, which provides for the conscription of industry, betting commissioners in Wall Street announced that the odds favoring Roosevelt’s re-election had shifted from 6 to 5 to 9 to 5. Soon thereafter, Mr. Luce, boss of Time and Fortune magazines, (personal friend of J.P. Morgan), whose publications started the original Willkie boom, began to wonder whether Willkie wasn’t another “Fat Alf”. Even Walter Lippman has questioned the advisability of Willkie’s candidacy. Truly, politics is an unkind game, as Mr. Willkie is fast learning.
Since we were confident a long time ago that Mr. Roosevelt was the best man for the job of preserving American capitalism and preparing American imperialism for war, we cannot register any surprise now that his re-election for a third term seems more or less certain. But two questions continue to puzzle us. The first is: Why are Willkie’s backers greasing the skids for his downfall, thus facilitating Roosevelt’s victory? And the second, and by far the more important question is: What is the real meaning and significance of the Overton-Russell amendment?
 
It Takes a Really Skilled Hand
A superficial answer to the first question is easy. Conscription of manpower is none too popular with the American masses. Conscription of men without conscription of industry smacks too much of rank class discrimination. Not even Willkie’s subsequent “clarification” of his position to the effect that he is not against conscription of. industry on principle, but only wanted “adequate safeguards.” following the lead of a New York Times editorial to that effect, can remedy the effects of that rash moment when Willkie allowed his real sentiments and attachment for property interests to push him into one of the most colossal boners any presidential aspirant has ever made. Willkie is, therefore, a losing proposition. His backers, you may say, don’t want to back a loser. Hence, they are withdrawing their support while there is still time to withdraw. Simple? A little too simple.
Our own speculations run along the following lines. Both Willkie and Roosevelt, as we shall have occasion to prove in detail later on, are candidates of the House of Morgan in a most direct way. The knifing of Willkie is merely evidence of the fact that the Morgan interests prefer the victory of Roosevelt. This decision, in turn, is based on the strengthening of England’s resistance to Hitler. Prolonged British resistance, say into the spring of 1941, increases the probability of immediate American entry into the war. To facilitate this delicate job requires the touch and guidance of a master hand in fooling the workers. Who can do this job better, or as well as, Roosevelt? Wall Street may be for Willkie. But a very important section of the American ruling class is working in such a way as to increase the prospects of a Roosevelt victory.
 
A Very Clever Maneuver
When Willkie denounced the Overton-Russell amendment as “socialistic,” and threatening to “sovietize American industry,” he also denounced those who favored the amendment as sponsors of “a cheap political trick.” There is good reason for believing that the timing of the Overton-Russell amendment was a very clever political maneuver. Indeed, Mr. Arthur Krock, of the New York Times, claims that it was designed as a political trap to catch Willkie and the Republican senators. Be that as it may, Willkie was certainly caught, but a majority of the GOP senators voted for it! The question is clearly not a party issue. If there were any doubts about this, the overwhelming vote in the House for the Smith amendment (which corresponds to the Senate’s Overton-Russell amendment) should have dispelled them. Since all the members of the House are up for re-election this year, we can safely conclude that all but 31 members of the House want to be re-elected and don’t come from blue-stocking districts.
It is well to point out that the Smith amendment is more precise and not so sweeping as the Overton-Russell amendment although both are substantially the same – they both give the President the power to commandeer plants if the employer proves recalcitrant; that is, should the Secretary of War or of the Navy be unable to arrive at an agreement. In particular, it does not authorize permanent possession by the government, but merely the leasing of the plant by the Government during the period of emergency.
Obviously, the conscription of industry (as proposed in either amendment or in whatever compromise is finally adopted) will not sovietize American industry. So far as this aspect of the question is concerned, the measure is simply another step – and a long one, at that – towards the establishment of a totalitarian state in this country. Far from meaning any tendency towards socialism it will mean the exact opposite – a step towards capitalist totalitarianism.
 
Part and Parcel of the War Drive
Why, one is required to ask, is this amendment tacked on to the Burke-Wadsworth conscription bill? Here, the obvious answer is the only one. It makes a good political appeal (especially for votes) to point out to the workers that only only are they being conscripted but so is industry. As such, it is clearly “fairer.” And we are certainly in favor of drafting wealth. The workers, however, must understand that the entire conscription bill, including the amendment to conscript industry, is part of the general drive towards war and the establishment of a totalitarian regime in this country.
Moreover, it gives Roosevelt a chance to pose as the champion of the masses by favoring the conscription of wealth. To be sure, Roosevelt has so far allowed Wallace to do his talking for him. Nevertheless, the whole business, greatly aided by Willkie’s boner has strengthened the Roosevelt Administration. It should be obvious to everyone that Roosevelt’s fundamental ideas on property are basically the same as Willkie’s. Both are wedded to capitalism and the preservation of property rights.
The idea that industry is being conscripted is a pure fake. If that were the case, it would hardly be necessary to spend so much time discussing the excess profits bill. Industry which is conscripted, wealth which is drafted, won’t have to haggle about profit. IT WILL BE OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THAT IS REAL CONSCRIPTION OF INDUSTRY. To be effective, however, it must be under the control of the workers. As long as the capitalists own the means of production, and J.P. Morgan can make and unmake Presidents, any conscription of industry will safeguard property rights.
 



The recent sudden rise in food prices, particularly meat prices, raises for every worker the question of whether the United States stands on the threshold of an inflationary period. The sharp price rise that occurred after the outbreak of the war in Europe in September 1939 gave way at the beginning of 1940 to a steady decline, which lasted until this summer. Since that time the trend has been in the direction of rising prices. All wholesale prices, for example have risen more than four points during the last month. Retail prices, of course, have gone up even more sharply.
So pronounced has the rise in some food prices been that Miss Harriet Elliott, consumer adviser to the National Defense Commission, has acknowledged a steady increase in complaints since the beginning of September. A similar situation is reported by the Bureau of Consumer Service of New York City’s Department of Markets. Prices of steaks have gone up five to eight cents a pound. Beef, pork and lamb are also special objects of complaint. Even the butchers are complaining as the price rise is depriving them of customers. Various government bureaus are now investigating the situation. So, don’t
A spokesman for the packing industry in Chicago, who refused to allow his name to be used, stated to the press that “the situation was partly seasonal, partly due to higher payrolls and partly attributable to the fact that the old livestock crop year was ending and the new crop year about to begin.”
 
More Than One Way of Cutting Wages
If the factors that have caused this price rise are merely temporary and accidental, then we don’t have to worry about inflation. But if they are more or less a permanent part of our general economic situation, then every worker and every trade unionist must give the problem his closest attention. For there is more than one way of cutting wages, as has been demonstrated time and again during the tortured history of capitalism. Every worker knows and understands the simple and direct method of cutting wages. The boss simply reduces the wage. Even such indirect methods of wage-cutting as lengthening working hours or the use of the speed-up are familiar enough to the average worker. Fighting against these things are part of his daily struggle for existence.
The cleverest method of cutting wages, because the worker doesn’t experience it on his job, is the inflationary method. A period of generally and rapidly rising prices is considered inflationary. The worker might even receive an increase in the amount of money he receives every week. But before he knows it, he and his wife discover that his wage buys less food and other necessities than before. What has happened, of course, is that prices of things the worker and his family must buy have gone up much more than any possible raise in his wages. The economist sums this process up by saying that purchasing power has decreased. In a period of inflation, the decline in ability to buy and the rise in prices is most marked.
It would be interesting to ask the representative of the meat packers just exactly what he means by saying that higher payrolls are part of the explanation of the recent rise in meat prices. He would probably answer that wage costs in the meat packing industry have gone up. Consequently, in order to maintain profits, prices have to be raised. But we have the faint suspicion that the workers in the packing houses would have something to say about that. It is also not impossible that the real meaning is that there has been a certain amount of re-employment in some communities due to the “defense” program. This increase in payrolls provides the meat packers with an opportunity to raise their prices and make greater profits. The workers, they figure, can “afford” to pay higher prices.
 
Various Indications of Inflation
It is still too early to state definitely whether the country is entering a period of inflation, but there are already unmistakeable signs pointing in that direction in the not-too-distant future. One indication is the fact that the total money in circulation is now well over 8 billion dollars. This is the highest figure in American history. Much of this may be attributed to hoarding, especially by foreigners. Nevertheless, a large amount of money in circulation is always one of the characteristics of inflation. If not at present, then some time in the future, this can easily help along an inflationary process.
Another indication is the fact that bank deposits are also at record highs. The Federal Reserve Board’s most recent figures show the total of bank deposits and money in the hands of the public at a record high of $67,000,000,000. This fact must be coupled with another very important fact – namely, that excess reserves of the Federal Reserve System are now over 6½ billion dollars, almost the all-time peak. This means that the banks have this huge sum around just lying idle. The way the banking system operates, this money can be used to lend anywheres from 30 to 60 billion dollars. Both facts taken together mean that the base for a most colossal credit inflation has already been laid.
 
Because of the War Trend Is World-Wide
Still, something is required to set off the inflationary process, if it is to occur in the near future. Historically, that something has usually been war. This war is proving no exception. In England, for example, the country whose economy most closely resembles that of the U.S., all wholesale prices increased an average of 37.2 per cent from June 1939 to June 1940. The cost of living advanced 16 per cent during this period. In Russia, which experienced just a minor war with Finland so far, Mr. Gedye of the New York Times, stated that there has been a particularly sharp rise in prices (between January and April of this year, butter increased in price by 45 per cent, cheese by 20 per cent, sausages, bacon and ham by 25 per cent; gas, water and electricity from 50 to 100 per cent) while incomes have remained stationary and hours of work have been lengthened.
Even in Germany, the country with the most rigidly controlled price system in the world, while wages have remained absolutely fixed and hours of work have lengthened to from 10 to 14 hours per day, there have been some very pronounced price rises (from 10 to 40 per cent in many cases) especially in such staple items of the German diet as potatoes and sausages. The same experience is to be noted in Japan and Italy. What is taking place is clearly a world-wide inflationary trend. It is just a faint indication of how the entire world situation is loaded with dynamite.
 
A Question for the Union Agenda
Even should the U.S. not enter the war in the near future, the cost of the “defense” program threatens a runaway inflation. This is clearly recognized in a study just completed by the National Industrial Conference Board. The huge cost of this program all of which is just so much waste so far as the satisfaction of human wants is concerned, indicates that only a small portion will be covered through increased taxation. The capitalists are certainly going to oppose any increased taxation on the rich and there is a limit to the burden of taxation that can be placed on the workers without producing unrest and rebellion. The most “painless” method of meeting the huge cost of this program is, therefore, largely through increased Government borrowing. No matter what price controls are introduced – and there will be many – a rapidly rising Federal Debt is bound to give a strong impulse to the inflationary process.
In summary, therefore: The bases for a vast inflation already exist in the United States. The next months should witness further advances in prices. Every trade unionist, as a matter of self-protection, must immediately demand that this question. along with the worker’s natural answer to the problem – a rising scale of wages – be placed on the agenda of his next union meeting.
 



While the final text of the proposed excess profits and amortization bill is still to be prepared, the Bill as passed in the house indicates that one of the most gigantic swindles in the history of the country is now being prepared in Washington. In order to offset the growing clamor from labor unions, some sections of the press and public sentiment, that if the workers are to be conscripted, and offered to the sacrifice, the only fair thing to do is to conscript capital as well, the ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION IS PREPARING AN EXCESS PROFITS AND AMORTIZATION BILL THAT WILL SEEMINGLY REQUIRE SACRIFICES OF CAPITAL, BUT WHICH WILL, IN REALITY, GUARANTEE THE CAPITALISTS HIGHER PROFITS THAN THEY HAVE MADE IN MANY A LONG YEAR.
Manufacturers are holding up hundreds of millions of dollars worth of army, navy and air contracts because, as they say, “We don’t trust the government; we must have absolute guarantees (of our profits) before a wheel turns.” Just imagine what a hue and cry would arise from the paid propagandists of the capitalist press if the workers, after the conscription bill is passed, said, “We refuse to allow ourselves to be conscripted until we receive absolute guarantees that any war this country engages in will not be for imperialist purposes but in the interests of the working masses of this country!” Cries of “traitor,” “red,” “fifth columnists,” etc. would be hurled at the workers. But when a manufacturer refuses to sign a “defense” contract until his profits are guaranteed, that is true patriotism.
 
Millions for the Millionaires
The President has already said “there will be no new millionaires as a result of the armaments program. However, the tax bill in preparation, gives the lie to this high-sounding phrase. Not only will there be new millionaires, but the present millionaires (according to a recently issued statement of the Treasury, 50 individuals filed income taxes for 1939 showing incomes of a million dollars and more in 1938) will make even more millions than they have in the past.
What worries our patriotic manufacturers most appears to be the amortization measure. Their argument runs something like this: “These new contracts require us to erect new plants. These new factories will cost huge sums of money and they will be practically worthless once the war is over. Unless we are allowed to write-off (amortize) the cost of the new factories in a ‘reasonable’ period of time (five years or less), we will lose our shirts.” Normally, a manufacturer writes-off the cost of new plant equipment (capital investment) in a period of 20 years by setting up a sinking fund. In other words, if a five year period is decided upon, approximately 20% of the cost of new plant equipment will be added to expenses. Since in this modern day of mass production, fixed capital (machines, etc.) constitutes an ever-increasing proportion of the total capital accumulation of the modern corporation, this means that sums running into the millions and millions will be deducted from profits AND THEREFORE NOT ELIGIBLE TO THE EXCESS PROFITS TAX.
In addition to this gravy which will be secured to the capitalist, there are any number of other considerations which are positively fascinating in their appeal to the manufacturer’s patriotism. Suppose, for example, the war and/or the “defense” program lasts more than five years; having already written-off the cost of the new factories, profits will be absolutely fantastic. Even should the war period end in the next five years, an airplane manufacturer, to take just one example, will certainly be able to use his new factories in peacetime pursuits.
Finally, in many cases, it will undoubtedly be found that these new factories erected for “defense” purposes will not fill only government orders. Many of them will be able to fill private contracts for England. In such cases, a manufacturer may well decide to use his new plants to fill U.S. Government orders, since these may be subject to various restrictions (Walsh-Healy Bill, for example) and his old plants to fill other contracts. Truly, the prospects of coining huge profits are so good that it actually staggers the imagination. AND SINCE ROOSEVELT AND ALL CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HAVE ALREADY STATED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO GUARANTEE THE PASSAGE OF AN AMORTIZATION MEASURE PROVIDING FOR EVERYTHING THE MANUFACTURERS WANT. WHAT IS REALLY DISTURBING OUR PATRIOTIC MANUFACTURERS?
 
Just a Tiny Fly in the Ointment
It is simply the insistence of the Administration, fully aware that an election is coming up in November, in coupling the amortization measure with an excess profits tax. The politicians know that if they give the capitalists everything they want in regard to the amortization measure, mass resentment will be extremely high (and will cost votes) unless this is compensated for by placing a ceiling on profits. That is why Roosevelt has turned a deaf ear to the pleas of the New York Times to pass only an amortization bill now and spend the rest of the year studying the problem of excess profits very carefully since “it is so complicated and can’t go into effect until the 1941 income tax returns are made.” Excess profits, of course, are a “complicated” question, but not conscription. Present signs, however, indicate that an excess profits tax will be passed. But what kind? – that is another question. Without going into the technical complications, and the various alternatives, which require a Philadelphia lawyer to disentangle, the basis of the proposed bill is TO EXEMPT FROM AN EXCESS PROFITS TAX, PROFITS AMOUNTING TO A SUM EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE NET PROFIT MADE DURING 1930–1939. For most of the large corporations, this is a pretty favorable period. It has only one bad year included – 1938. It includes two fairly good years, 1936 and 1939 – and one exceptionally good year, 1937. In addition, the average earnings during this base-period will be increased by 8% of new capital invested. This means that large corporations (say General Motors or U.S. Steel, who will certainly get their .share of the contracts) will make from 8 to 10% and more profits, without having to pay an excess profits tax.
There may not be many new millionaires, but a lot of the old ones are going to increase their fortunes sizeably. Moreover, should profits now run so phenomenally high, it doesn’t follow that the portion of profits which is subject to the excess profits tax will be confiscated by the government. So far, the highest excess profits tax proposed is 50%. The average rate aimed at is apparently 25%. Thus, the manufacturer will be allowed to keep a goodly portion of the excess profits. Certainly, no restraints on “private initiative” here!
The sacrifices that capital will be required to make “in the interests of national defense” will, consequently, be largely on paper. They will be useful for bamboozling the workers, but they will not interfere with the patriotism of the bosses – which, as always, centers around their pocket-books.
Just in case the above analysis has been a bit too difficult for you to follow in detail. THE SINGLE FACT WHICH EXPOSES THE EXCESS PROFITS SWINDLE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS THAT THE ESTIMATED YIELD OF THE PROPOSED EXCESS PROFITS TAX FOR 1940 IS $300,000,000. This, of course, is mere chicken-feed. It is a drop in the bucket when compared with the billions and billions of dollars now being spent on armaments. It is even less when compared with the billions of dollars that corporations will make. It clearly shows that the Government does not expect very much help in meeting the costs of “defense” from the excess profits tax. As always, the costs of war will be borne by the masses – not by the bosses.
One immediate conclusion that every worker must draw from this situation is to raise in his union the demand for NATIONALIZATION OF ALL WAR INDUSTRIES. THIS IS ONE WAY OF STOPPING THE PROPOSED EXCESS PROFITS SWINDLE.
 



As usual, the important news is being buried by the capitalist press in the corners of their financial pages. While you and the average worker may be worrying about how to feed your families decently, how you are going to pay the rent and send the family on a much-needed vacation at the same time, while 9,000,000 (latest official figure) unemployed are still gazing wistfully at “No Help Wanted” signs; and, incidentally, while the Government is spending billions and billions of dollars on “Defense” and occasionally worrying about where the money is to come from, the big corporations of the country are raking in profits at a terrific rate – reminiscent of the boom days of 1929.
What? You didn’t receive your quarterly dividend check? The mailman must have mistakenly given it to your neighbor. Better check up on him tomorrow.
Just in case you belong to the 90% of the population who don’t own stocks and clip coupons for a living and the almost equally large proportion of the population who have never been educated to the importance of reading the financial pages, I’ve drawn up a few figures and comments for you to mull over in your mind after a good, heavy dinner (see box below).
That the corporations listed are by no means exceptions is shown by the fact that the first 100 companies reporting earnings for the first half of 1940, according to a compilation made by The New York Times, had an aggregate net income of $113,658,828 – or a net gain of 60.5% over the first half of 1939. An Associated Press compilation of the first 150 corporations to report for the second quarter of 1940 shows an aggregate net income of $168,902,000 – or a net gain of 39% over the second quarter of 1939. Excluding A.T.&T., the net gain becomes 52%. And this, mind you, excludes such great corporations as General Motors, which, during the previous ten (depression) years made over $1,000,000,000 net profit.
While, to quote The New York Times’ comment, “The tone of corporation executives’ letters to their stockholders, which accompanied the earnings statements, was predominantly optimistic,” union demands for increased wages have almost uniformly been met with a categorical “No!”
At the same time, activity on the New York Stock Exchange during the month of July declined to the lowest figure in more than two decades!
What does it all mean? First, note that the more corporations that are included, the smaller becomes the increase in the rate of profit. In simple English, this means that every year fewer and fewer of the great corporations are making more and more of the profits.
 
The Story of Steel
If further proof of this fundamental fact is needed, let us look more closely at the statement of U.S. Steel. One might think that with an increase of 1,743 per cent in profits there might be, if not a corresponding increase in wages, then, at least a substantial increase in wages, For the first half of 1940, U.S. Steel employed 242,144 workers with a total payroll of $198,871,911. For the corresponding period of 1939, the figures were 208,133 workers with a total payroll of $163,461,751. What are the workers bellyaching about, anyway, Mr. Stettinius and his successor, Mr. Olds, undoubtedly want to know? Didn’t we pay out over $36,000,000 more in wages this year?
Aside from the fact that these figures are for employees, which includes high-salaried executives, so that it is impossible to figure out the real average wage per worker, THESE FIGURES REVEAL AN INCREASE OF ONLY $40 PER EMPLOYEE. That is to say, by hiring a few thousand more workers, paying them an average of less than $7 per month more than they got in 1939, PRODUCTION WAS STEPPED UP OVER 94% OF CAPACITY AND PROFITS ROSE SKY-HIGH.
The story of U.S. Steel is symbolic and representative of what is happening in American industry today, and also what ails this country today. During the last decade, American industry has gone through such a tremendous process of rational lotion, introducing the most up-to-date labor-saving devices that very small increases in the laboring force and in wages result in tremendous increases in production and absolutely phenomenal increases in profits. Millions of workers are now permanently useless to the industrial process under capitalism. The recovery in profits is not only the story of the remarkable technical skill and efficiency of American industry but equally the story of millions of unemployed and even more millions trying to eke out a living on starvation wages. In other words, PROFITS ARE LITERALLY BEING COINED OUT OF WORKERS’ SWEAT AND BLOOD.
The recovery in profits is due to many factors, but the factor which dominates at the present time is the war. It is significant that the big profits are being shown by the heavy industries and the railroads. The U.S., following the example of Europe, has entered upon an armaments economy. What this means, I shall try to show in detail in subsequent articles. For the present, let me conclude by pointing out that the abnormally low volume of sales on the Stock Exchange in the face of these unusually high profits merely reveals that Wall Street is well aware of the fact that the “prosperity” in this country is based on the war and the continuation of the war, and during July Wall Street was unable to make up its mind whether the war was going to continue or not. Perhaps Messrs. Molotoff, Hitler, Churchill and Roosevelt will furnish them with an affirmative answer.

THE KEY INDUSTRY of the war, fast becoming the leading industry of the country, is aircraft. Moreover, its strategic rôle and importance are not confined to war. Its potentialities for peacetime transportation and commerce may be somewhat obscured at present due to the destructive capacities of aviation as revealed by the blitzkrieg, but aircraft is clearly marked as the industry of the future. By August 1 of this year, more than half a million workers will be employed in the industry. The industry has a backlog of more than $4 billion. Its expansion has been absolutely phenomenal, more so than any other industry in the history of American capitalism.
Much discussion has filled the press about the President’s goal of 50,000 planes a year and why the United States is so far from filling it at present. More pertinent, however, would be the query: Why is it that the United States, whose inventive genius produced this remarkable invention at the turn of the century, should now lag way behind in the production of airplanes? The answer to this important question is to be found in the history of aircraft, an obscure story but one which is replete with scandals, greed, intrigue, financial manipulation, patent pools, fabulous profits, government subsidies, and monopoly control.
 
How the Industry Began
In spite of the fact that The Hague Peace Conference had unanimously voted to outlaw the airplane as a weapon of warfare, the bourgeoisie was so entranced with the military potentialities of the airplane that all nations engaged in research and experimentation with this end in view. But from 1909–1913, while the United States spent $435,000 on airplanes, with the result that at the outbreak of World War I, the Army had 28 planes on hand; Germany had spent $28,000,000 during the same period and had 4,000 planes on hand. Thus, the birth of the aircraft industry in the United States coincided with the outbreak of World War I, the period when far-reaching monopolistic controls of virtually all American industry were being developed.
The pioneers of the industry were the original inventors and their successors. As soon as the Allies began to place orders for airplanes in the United States, and the prospect of tremendous profits opened up. Wall Sreet speculators and automobile manufacturers began to take an interest in the production of airplanes. A patent pool was formed under the aegis of the Manufacturers Aircraft Association, the first trade association in the aircraft industry. The association collected a blanket royalty fee of $200 per airplane and apportioned the patent fees among the basic patent owners, the Curtiss Aeroplane & Motor Co. and the Wright-Martin Aircraft Co. These two companies collected over $2,000,000 each from patent fee alone. The MAA secured the ear of official Washington through the persons of Howard E. Coffin, vice-president of Hudson Motor Co. (one of the automobile companies directly interested in the manufacture of airplanes), who became chairman of the Aircraft Production Board, and Edward A. Deeds, an individual with an extremely notorious record, who was one of the leading people in the organization of the Dayton Wright Airplane Co. Through their efforts over one billion dollars was appropriated by Congress to supply the U.S. Army with airplanes. At least 29,000 planes were expected as a result of this huge appropriation. However, only 196 actually saw service in Europe!
The Manufacturers Aircraft Association was attacked as a trust and a terrific scandal broke in the newspapers and finally landed in the halls of Congress. President Wilson felt compelled to appoint a committee of investigation headed by Snowden H. Marshall. This committee brought in a verdict of “no truth in the charges.” Instead of subsiding, however, the stench began to rise. Deeds was court-martialled; but, through the intervention of Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, Deeds, was acquitted and the reputation of the industry was saved. Even this did not end the matter, as after the Armistice Wilson felt constrained to appoint another committee to investigate the aircraft industry – this time headed by Justice Hughes. This committee “found nothing to criticize” in the conduct of the aircraft industry.
 
How the Profits Grew
The end of the war also saw the end of the huge profits reaped by the insiders. The scandals of the war period and the crashes of army fliers resulted in loss of confidence on the part of the public, especially the investing public. The aviation industry remained in a state of doldrums until Lindbergh’s historic flight of May 20, 1927, which fortunately coincided with the beginning of the stock market boom. Public interest awakened; confidence in the future of aviation grew and aviation stocks began to be sold. By the end of 1929 the public had swallowed over a billion dollars in aviation stocks. By 1932 the value of these stocks had sunk to a low of fifty million dollars! Some people undoubtedly lost a lot of money, but again the insiders reaped huge fortunes.
For example, Charles W. Deeds, son of Albert A. Deeds invested $40 in 1926. At the 1929 high this was worth $5,550,000. F. B. Rentschler (now chairman of of the board of United Aircraft), brother of the future president of the National City Bank of New York, probably made the biggest killing of all. His investment of $253 in Pratt & Whitney stock was worth a cool $35,000,000 in 1929. Pratt & Whitney Corp., organized after the war with a capital of $1,000 made, according to the Nye Munitions Investigating Committee, a profit of over 1,300,000 per cent in ten years! During all this time, of course, the actual production of airplanes was infinitesmal; other countries had forged way ahead of the U.S.
By 1929, through a combination of mergers, stock watering, holding company setups, and general financial chicanery, finance capital had achieved complete control of the aircraft industry. The 150 companies manufacturing aircraft were dominated and controlled by the following five companies: Curtiss Aeroplane & Manufacturing, United Aircraft & Transportation, Wright Aeronautical, Western Air Express and Aviation Corporation. During the past decade, more than half the companies have been eliminated. The remainder are dominated by three powerful, well-integrated finance capital units. They are, in order of their size (based on total assets at the end of 1940): Curtiss-Wright, $202,000,000; United Aircraft, $132,000,000; and North American Aviation, $54,000,000.
 
Interlocking Relations
Monopoly’s baby has come of age. Each of the three leading systems is a top-holding company for an entire system, two of them, Curtiss-Wright and North American, representing General Motors – that is, the Morgan-duPont finance capital interests – and the other, United Aircraft, representing the National City Bank group. Curtiss-Wright, formed as a result of a merger between Curtiss Aeroplane & Manufacturing and Wright Aeronautical in 1929, now claims to be the world’s largest group, with 29 subsidiaries and 18 affiliated companies. Indirectly controlled by General Motors, Curtiss-Wight has a maze of ties with virtually all sections of American industry through the more influential members of its board of directors. The chairman of the board, George Armsby, adorns the directorates of a mere 22 corporations, the more significant of those outside of aircraft being Vickers, Tide Water Associated Oil, Standard Gas & Electric, Petroleum Corporation, American Maracaibo, California Packing, and Loew’s. Edgar S. Bloom is a very important member of its board. His 10 directorships help to establish cordial relations with Manufacturers Trust and Western Electric. In passing, it should be noted that Bloom is the director of purchases of the British Purchasing Commission, making him a rather useful person for an aircraft company to have on its board. Other members establish connections with Sperry Gyroscope, Ford Instrument, Douglas Aircraft, Transcontinental Air Transport, Empire Trust, Fisk Rubber, Hayden, Stone & Co., Girard Trust, Ken-necott Copper, Mack Truck and Adams Express. Manufacturers Trust, one of the Morgan banks, is represented through several men, especially the president of Curtiss-Wright, G.W. Vaughn.
 
Finance Capital Dominates
United Aircraft acquires most of its importance through its control of Pratt & Whitney and Pan American Airways, although Hamilton Standard Propellers and Vought-Sikorsky are becoming increasingly important. It work is spread out among 650 vendors, scattered over twenty states. Its list of directors is not quite as imposing as Curtiss-Wright, but its key men, Rentschler, Eugene R. Wilson, who is president, Morgan B. Brainard, Byron C. Foy, William B. Mayo, provide links with National City Bank, Dime Savings Bank, Chrysler, some smaller automobile companies, New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad and other transportation interests, Swift & Co., and the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co.
The most significant group, however, is probably the one headed by North American Aviation, for it was organized and is directly controlled by General Motors. Directly under its control are Ford Instrument, Sperry Bendix and Douglas. It controls Western Air Express and has great influence in Curtiss-Wright. Its strategic importance to General Motors can be seen merely from the fact that one of its directors is Henry B. duPont. The chairman of the board is Ernest R. Breech, a member of the board of General Motors and one of its key figures in the aircraft industry. It is also linked with International Nickel.
The other companies which serve to round out the picture of concentration in a few hands are the Aviation Corporation, which controls Vultee and American Airways, and is bossed by Victor Emanuel, one of the leading lights in the Rockefeller group. Bell and Lockheed appear to be independent corporations, but are, in reality, completely controlled by General Motors through one of its smaller holding companies, National Aviation. Consolidated is clearly controlled by Lehman Brothers. Its board of directors is loaded down with Lehman men, including Robert Lehman. The two other important companies, Martin and Boeing, have not escaped the long arm of capital, either. On Martin’s board of directors appear John W. Castles, a partner in Smith-Barney & Co., and John W. Hanes, one of the most influential of Morgan representatives. Boeing apparently does not have any direct links with the better-known sections of finance capital, but is controlled by local Pacific Coast representatives.
American finance capital thus enters World War II with a firm grip on the aircraft industry. In 1938, 95 per cent of the total value of the industry’s product was produced by the 13 leading companies. In 1940, 90 per cent of the greatly increased production was produced by the eight leading companies. With the aircraft industry tied up with virtually every other American industry (technically, this is necessary as aircraft represents the synthesis of all industry), with its dollar-a-year representatives in Washington performing meritorious services comparable to those of Coffin and Deeds in World War I, with the excess profits tax removing the ceiling on profits from the aircraft industry, with an escalator clause on prices in all contracts with the U.S. government, the latter, in effect, paying the cost of plant expansions, and with England and the Allies paying higher prices and cash in advance for, in many cases, inferior planes, it is no wonder that the industry is having a field day. World War II is presenting the industry with even larger profits than in the case of World War I. A scandal is in the making, which may not be concealed even by the secrecy which surrounds the industry today, and which, if it breaks, will dwarf that of the last war.
 
Phenomenal Profits the Rule
The financial pages of the newspapers daily reveal how the aircraft industry is utilizing the tremendous subsidies and favorable contracts which it is receiving to demonstrate that “patriotism” pays off in hard cash. The following table (taken from the New Republic, Feb. 17, 1941) shows the annual rate of return on net worth of selected aircraft companies (in per cent):

1940, as is well known, was a banner year for American capitalists. The aircraft industry, however, made the rest of American industry look as if it was in a state of depression. According to a report in the New York Times of April 27, 1941: “Twenty-four makers of aircraft last year earned $69,866,405, more than double the profits shown in 1939, nearly three times 1938 results and more than five times their earnings in 1937. Each of these years set a new high record for the industry and further peaks are likely under the national defense effort.” (Italics mine – FD) Moreover, 14 of these companies made slightly more than $60 million of the total, or more than 85 per cent of the total profit in aircraft went to these 14 companies. And the four largest companies made a total of $47 million, or over 67 per cent of the total profit.
Many companies showed profits considerably above the 100 per cent increase that the industry as a whole shows over 1939. Two of the larger companies and two of the smaller companies in this category are:

In addition, it should be pointed out that none of the figures on profits give any indication at all of the tremendous bonuses and salaries that the aircraft companies have been paying their executives. Nor, do they take into account the well-known fact that virtually all the aircraft companies have watered their stock to an unprecedented degree.
Perhaps the most important index of how the merchants of death profit at the expense of the workers can be seen if the rate of profit is compared with the rate of surplus value. Figuring the rate of profit on the basis of total assets (which yields the smallest percentage possible) and taking the three dominant companies as the basis for calculating the rate of profit (for the rate of profit for the industry as a whole must be larger than that shown by these three, as these have the largest investments in constant capital) we get the following picture: (From the 1940 financial statements) —

The rate of profit for the industry as a whole is, therefore, at least 10 per cent. That this is a conservative figure is shown by the fact that the average return on sales for the industry as a whole is about 20 per cent. In other words, if the average airplane (of the important military types) is sold to the government for about $100,000 per plane, the cost per plane to the manufacturer is about $80,000 (this, of course, makes no allowance for the phony bookkeeping of the capitalists) and the net profit per plane will run around $10,000, In view of this situation, it is hardly a surprise that statistics concerning prices and costs of airplanes are considered a “military secret.”
 
The Rate of Surplus Value
While it is difficult under these circumstances to calculate the rate of surplus value, it is possible to arrive at a fair approximation, which is important in estimating the degree of exploitation of labor in the industry and in understanding how finance capital operates. Maximum estimates of the average wage per employee in th industry are given by Fortune (Mar. 1941) in its over-zealous whitewash issue of the aircraft industry is about $1,800. It is undoubtedly much lower than this as the minimum wage paid by most aircraft companies is 50¢ an hour or an annual wage for the worker and his family of $1,300. Taking the figure of $1,800 as the average wage, and assuming that the value of the constant capital transferred to the value of the finished commodity by the application of labor power is also equal to $1,800 per worker (it is certainly no larger than this), we find that the amount of surplus value produced by each worker is equal to $2,184 on the average for 1940. This is based on an estimate of $5,784 as the value of each workers’ output given by Donald Ross in his An Appraisal of Prospects for the Aircraft Industry. Dividing the amount of surplus value produced by each worker on the average by the average wage, the rate of surplus value in the aircraft industry for 1940 was over 120%, and, it must be emphasised, this is a conservative figure. The same methods show a rate of surplus value for 1939 of about 100%. Consequently, the rate of surplus value increased by, at least, 20% in 1940 as compared with 1939. No wonder profits increased phenomenally during the past year.
The growth in profits has paralleled the increase in employment. “Three years ago the building of aircraft required only 30,500 men – 10,500 less than the knit-underwear business. Today over 200,000 workers are on aircrafts payroll – an increase of 150,000 in two years. Estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that by August 1 (1941) employment will exceed 550,000 – 15 per cent larger than last year’s average employment in steel and nearly 25 per cent more than motor vehicles, the present giants. The acceleration has been tenfold in thirty months, compared to a sevenfold increase in shipbuilding durinng the four years of the last war.” (Fortune) The height of the expansion during the last war required only 175,000 workers in 1918. Today, it is estimated that by the end of 1943 when the industry expects to be producing at the rate of 50,000 planes a year, over 1,000,000 workers will be employed in the aircraft industry.
 
Aircraft’s Labor Policy
The bosses have reinforced their policy of low wages and bad housing conditions by one of the most vicious company union and anti-Negro and anti-Semitic policies of any section of American industry. When Consolidated’s company union program collapsed in Buffalo during the NRA days, the company dismantled its plant and moved to the more attractive labor climate of California. Douglas broke two strikes through the use of thugs and armed vigilantes. As long as the labor force remained small and fairly stable, the aircraft manufacturers were able to escape the strike waves of recent years. The industry was firmly in the grip of finance capital, with the single exception of Brewster, which signed a union shop contract with the CIO-UAW in 1937. Otherwise, there wasn’t a cloud on the horizon.
However, the expansion of the past two years brought on by the outbreak of World War II disturbed the equanimity of the aircraft manufacturers. Called on to expand production at a terrific rate, they found themselves surrounded by various monopolistic interests, such as Mellon’s aluminum monopoly, that felt they could make more profit by getting every last cent out of present capital investment rather than building new plants. Consequently, the expansion of the entire war economy of American imperialism has been much slower than military necessity dictates. After all, profits come first. Cross-patents with German capitalists, such as in the case of beryllium, also interfered with the necessary expansion. Then, the automobile industry, which is closely linked with aircraft and has somewhat of a stranglehold on it, as I have shown, feared the consequences of rapid expansion. Hence, the rejection of the Reuther plan. To be sure, the aircraft manufacturers themselves were not loathe to follow this general policy of finance capital. All the entreaties of the Government to sub-contract production of airplanes and parts have been met with stubborn resistance on the part of these “patriots.” Not even Knudsen’s plea at the end of 1940 that aircraft production was 30 per cent behind schedule moved them.
What really disturbed the equanimity of the aircraft manufacturers was that with the influx of workers necessitated by the expansion that was being carried on, there also came a concerted drive on the part of organized labor to organize the industry. The heart of this union drive has been the Aircraft Division of the UAW, which began serious attempts to organize about a year ago. The focal point in the UAW’s drive was Vultee. The success at Vultee, in spite of the combined opposition of the bosses and the government and a vicious newspaper campaign against the union, was the key to the 1941 strike wave and has led to several other contracts in the aircraft industry, mostly with small plants. The only dosed shop so far achieved by the CIO is with Brewster, when its original contract was renewed earlier this year. Although, there are many progressive features in this contract, which the CIO is using as a model for the industry, the union prejudiced its chances with the workers by accepting a minimum wage clause of 55 cents an hour, thus compromising one of its basic demands – a minimum wage of 75 cents an hour.
Alarmed by the threat of the CIO, the bosses openly invited the AFL Machinist’s union to come in and organize the workers in those plants where their company union setups proved of no avail against the CIO. With this as an opening wedge, and aided by a few strikes, the Machinists have made great headway in aircraft – already having contracts with Boeing, Lockheed and others. The Machinists probably have more contracts than the UAW, and the terms of their contracts appear to be as good. The jurisdictional situation is loaded with dynamite, but it is doubtful if the aircraft manufacturers will be able to maintain their company union policy, in spite of this serious division in organized labor’s ranks.
 
Anti-Semitism and Jim Crow
That which reveals the reactionary character of the aircraft manufacturers more than anything else, however, is their openly anti-Negro and anti-semitic policy. As Fortune delicately puts it: “The industry also has its prejudices. You will find an almost universal prejudice against Negroes – and in the West Coast plants against Jews. This statement stands the test of observation; you almost never see Negroes in aircraft factories nor do you see Jews in the West Coast plants except in some engineering departments. There is little concealment about the anti-Negro policy – the National Negro Congress did indeed receive a letter from Gerard Tuttle of Vultee stating that ‘it is not the policy of this company to employ people other than of the Caucasian race,’ a frank statement that undoubtedly bespeaks the industry’s belief that white workers have prejudices (sic). Anti-Jewish sentiment in Los Angeles is scrupulously denied, and if it exists, it is probably because the managers suspect all Jews of being infatuated intellectually with Communism in the between-wars world.” (Italics mine – FD)
The selfish, reactionary and, at times, just plain stupid policy of finance capital in aircraft only partially explains why the U.S. lags behind Germany in the production of military planes. The rest can be explained by the extreme conservatism of the Army General Staff. (For the previous history of how military short-sightedness resulted in the cashiering of General Billy Mitchell, and for a fairly good account of the general aircraft swindle prior to the outbreak of World War II, see The Aviation Business – From Kitty Hawk to Wall Street by Elsbeth E. Freudenthal). The Germans, because of technical and economic deficiencies have, for example, discovered that for the purpose of laying waste cities and gaining military objectives the most effective method – and therefore the most efficient method – is to build cheap, poor quality planes in as huge quantities as possible. The average flying time of the average German military plane is thus based on an expectancy of about 48 hours. Compare this with the rigid requirement of the U.S. Army that American military planes must have a life-expectancy of 1,000 hours flying time, and the difference in approach is clearly revealed. However, this is a disputed military question, which is not a subject of this article.
It is not an exaggeration to say that developments in aircraft will alter the face of the globe. From a military point of view, this has already been amply demonstrated. The future course of the war will only reinforce this view. What should not be lost sight of, however, is that with the expansion of the aircraft industry, the economic and political struggles centering around aircraft will have a profound effect on the future course of American society. The workers, if fascism is to be defeated, must take a leaf from the book of finance capital and embark on a bold, militant policy in the aircraft industry. The central point in the program of the workers must be the nationalization of the aircraft industry, under the control of the aircraft workers, the maintenance of a high level of struggle for unionization, increased wages, lower hours, and a general improvement of working conditions.
 
 


As the July 1 deadline to begin the new fiscal year approached, the duly elected representatives of the people put on their annually astonishing burst of speed and voted the largest federal budget in the history of the United States. Almost 70 per cent of the 1942 fiscal budget will go for war preparations. What has been happening to the federal budget can readily be seen from the table:

* Expenditures for war (exclusive of debt retirements) include only those directly listed by the Treasury under “National Defense.” However, many hundreds of millions of dollars appropriated for other agencies will directly and indirectly aid in war preparations.



More money will be spent for war preparations from July 1, 1941, to June 30, 1942, than was spent for all purposes during the past fiscal year. The total expenditures for the coming year are expected to exceed the previous record, during 1938–1939. by almost four billion dollars. Moreover, this total will undoubtedly be exceeded as the drive toward entry into a “shooting war” accelerates, requiring the passage of huge deficiency appropriations. From 1940 to 1941, direct appropriations for war increased about 400 per cent. From 1941 to 1942 they will increase at least 250 per cent more.
These figures simply mean that the United States has truly entered upon a long period of war economy. Representatives of the government and the boss press have been thundering at us for the past several months what this will mean to the working population of the country – gasless Sundays, reduction in the use of electricity for the home, no more aluminum pots and pans, etc. But it will mean much more than a few inconveniences in our normal habits of consumption. The burden of the war economy will be thrown onto the backs of those who toil and sweat for a living – that is the real meaning of this war budget. One of the first direct indications of this was the cutting down of the total relief appropriation to $910,905,000. This means a reduction of more than $457,000,000 from last year’s relief appropriation. Translated into human terms, it means that 700,000 of the 1,700,000 persons now on WPA will have to be dropped immediately.
The New York Times, in its report of this step, says: “In both Houses, the majority contended that in the coming year defense industries will absorb many of those dropped from the rolls, but at the same time, Congress was told by WPA officials that 5,500,000 persons will be unemployed during the next twelve months and that because of the uneven distribution of defense contracts many thousands were bound to suffer because of the relief cuts.” (Emphasis mine – F.D.) We can be not exaggerating the number of unemployed. Labor sources indicate a much higher figure. Moreover, dislocations in the war economy produced by the shifting of many factories from the production of peacetime consumer goods to war-time producer goods and the inability to procure some necessary raw materials for war production will undoubtedly throw many additional thousands of workers into the ranks of the unemployed.
This, however, is only the beginning of the story of how the developing war economy will mean a catastrophic decline in the living standards of the masses. War costs money. World War I cost the United States, according to the late President Coolidge, $100,000,000,000. The tremendous increase in man’s capacity for destruction in the intervening quarter of a century means that World War II will cost the United States a much greater sum.
It is expected that revenues for the 1942 fiscal year will total about $12,000,000,000, about five billion dollars more than the past year, but still ten billion dollars short of what is to be spent. The deficit, of course, will be covered by government borrowing. This will raise the national debt by June 30, 1942, to an expected $57,500,000,000. It probably will be much larger coming close to the present statutory limit of 65 billion dollars on the federal debt. Interest payments on the national debt during the past year amounted to $1,111,000,000. The overwhelming majority of these payments went to the banks and insurance companies. This year these companies will receive even more.
A rising national debt, particularly one based on a war economy, greatly increases the danger of inflation. Already Leon Henderson, federal price control administrator, speaks of the price situation as “very serious.” He believes that the cost of living is bound to go up and that far-reaching controls will be needed, particularly over wage rates. The cost of living has already gone up almost 5 per cent during the past year, more than nullifying most of the wage increases that some sections of the working class have won through strike action or the threat of strikes. An indication of what is in store for the workers is shown by the wholesale commodity index of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has risen almost 50 per cent since the outbreak of World War II. Retail prices always follow wholesale prices, as a rule, even though they lag behind somewhat. In other words prices, especially prices of necessities, will continue to rise during the next year – meaning a further and really substantial decline in the standard of living of the American workers and masses.
Nor is this the whole story of what the war budget means. The increased revenues will be covered only in small part by increased yields from existing taxes. The House Ways and Means Committee has not yet reported out the new tax bill. When it does I shall analyze it in detail. In will be raised through new excise taxes, which will be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. Practically all of these will bear most heavily on the workers and those in the low income brackets. In addition, the bulk of the increased revenue from income taxes will come from the middle classes. The most damning indictment of the proposed that it proposes a mere 10 per cent increase in the rates for the excess profits tax. This is a drop in a bucket and still leaves the excess profits tax as a pure swindle.
The opposition of the Workers Party to the war budget flows from our opposition to the imperialist war toward which Roosevelt is heading us. All sections of the working class should therefore oppose this war budget. The workers, especially the organized workers through their trade unions, must oppose this war budget because it means death and strangulation for them. It means a tremendous decline in their standard of living at the same time that the big capitalists are raking in fantastically high profits. It means a steady undermining of the hard-won rights and civil liberties of the workers as the capitalists try to solve the budgetary crisis by a more and more open drive to institute a rigid totalitarian regime in this country. We are not in the habit of giving run their government. But we have the right and the duty to point out to the workers that there is absolutely no reason why the main burden of the war should be shouldered by the workers and masses. There is no rational reason why people should be unemployed and starving in this country of wonderfully abundant resources and highly developed technical skills. There is no reason why prices should go up, why indirect taxes, which fall most heavily on those who can least afford to pay them, should increase. In short, there is no reason why the standard of living of the working population should go down while a few build up huge fortunes, except that this is the way the capitalist system functions, particularly in war-time.
Let the capitalists pay for their war! They can afford it! Let the government levy a 100 per cent excess profits tax. Take all the profits out of war. Nationalize the war industries and place them under control of the workers. Place a capital levy on the accumulated fortunes of big business men, wrung from the sweat and blood of the workers, and there can be a steadily rising standard of living and the preservation of democratic rights!
 



Workers Before and After Lenin
by Manya Gordon
New York. E.P. Button & Co., 1941, 524 pages
Manya Gordon has written an extremely interesting, valuable and well documented book about the conditions of the Russian workers. Unless one has read equivalent material (which would be much more difficult to gather), Workers Before and After Lenin is a MUST book for anyone who wishes to discuss the Russian question or who merely wishes to be conversant with what is taking place in Russia today.
“Without political freedom all forms of workers’ representation will continue to be a fraud. The proletariat will remain as heretofore in prison.” – Lenin, 1905, quoted by the author on the frontispiece. It is impossible to overemphasize this statement. Contrast it with the attitude of Stalin, as expressed by one of his journalists in Za Industrializatziu, April 9, 1931: “We are not in the habit of worrying about people. Rather we feel that of that bounty – people – we have more than enough.” This callous, bureaucratic indifference to the fate of the people has assumed monstrous proportions during the past decade, making the Stalinist regime one of the most hideous and oppressive in all the tortured history of mankind.
 
The Author’s Bias
The book, unfortunately, is much more than a factual study from official Soviet sources on the standard of living of the Russian workers. Miss Gordon, wife of Simeon Strunsky, ex-member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, ex-member of the Socialist Party, current supporter of La Guardia in the American Labor Party, has a political axe to grind. Her thesis is a very simple one. The Russian workers never should have made the revolution. Look how bad their conditions are today. Had capitalist democracy been permitted to survive in Russia, the gigantic strides made by the Russian proletariat after the 1905 Revolution would have resulted in just as much production as exists in Russia today and, in addition, there would be freedom for the masses instead of slavery. Besides, the Russian workers really didn’t want to make the October Revolution. Lenin, “the crafty demagogue,” “the clever opportunist,” “the master politician,” took advantage of the Russian workers and slipped the October Revolution over on them against their will and, certainly, against their best interests.
This thesis runs through the book like a red thread. It appears in one form or other in virtually every chapter. Even if the author were correct in her appraisal of the October Revolution, which we don’t admit for one moment, it would still represent a serious blemish on an otherwise excellent work. Repetition becomes tedious, even when it is a sound historical statement that is constantly reiterated. In this case, however, it is a compound of the Menshevik thesis that Russia was too backward for a socialist revolution, of the current bourgeois slander that Stalinism represents an inevitable and logical outgrowth of Leninism, and of the author’s plain ineptitude and ignorance in interpreting history.
One example will suffice. On page 355, in discussing Lenin’s Imperialism as a theoretical justification for the Russian revolution, the author states:
“He (Lenin) insisted that monopoly is the final phase of capitalism which during a war is inevitably converted ‘into an era of proletarian revolution.’ Lenin had no difficulty in finding these conditions in Russia. Because of its large-scale production, its cartels and syndicates and their affiliation with the banks, Russia like western Europe was ripe for the socialist revolution. Later, in 1920, when Lenin was faced with closed banks and huge empty plants he forgot completely his previous statements about Russia’s readiness for the socialist scheme of things. But it was too late, or rather, Lenin died too soon, and as a result the Russian people had to pay for his folly.”
 
The Nature of the Russian Revolution
It would be difficult to crowd more errors in interpreting history into one short paragraph than Manya Gordon does in the above. The Bolshevik leadership did not conceive it possible to build socialism in Russia alone. Russia, to them, was the weakest link in the capitalist chain. Being the first link to break, Russia would become the starting point of the world revolution, which was an indispensable prerequisite for the building of socialism. And, certainly, capitalist society as a whole was and is rotten-ripe for the building of socialism. The theory of socialism in a single country was a Stalinist perversion of Marxism. The Bolsheviks were hardly to blame if Noske and Scheideman, Manya Gordon’s political counterparts, slaughtered the main base of the first world revolution in Germany. The NEP was a necessary retreat, but an organized retreat. That Stalinism came to power during this period does not prove that the revolution should not have been made, but that the Russian workers were too weak after three years of imperialist war and four years of civil war (for which the bourgeoisie were responsible, not Lenin and the Bolsheviks, Miss Gordon) to withstand the inroads of Stalinism.
Moreover, it seems to me that the author, anxious to prove her case, overstates it substantially when she speaks about the decade of progress under Czarism prior to the revolution. Time and again, in referring to the advanced labor legislation adopted under the Duma (and won by the magnificent fighting power of the Russian workers), she is forced to admit that it remained largely or entirely on paper. For the sake of argument, however, I can grant all that Miss Gordon says about the progress of industry and the standard of living under Czarism. This does not prove that had a bourgeois democratic regime maintained itself in Russia after the overthrow of Czarism that there would have been just as much industrialization (with a comparable rise in the standard of living). Why should a capitalist Russia have made any more progress during the 1920s and the 1930s than the rest of the capitalist world? And, if the argument is made that Russia would have been a young capitalist country, one can point to China, or India, or Canada, or Australia or other young outposts of capitalism and demonstrate that the progress of their industrialization during the last two decades, particularly the last one, has been absolutely feeble in comparison with that of Russia.
 
The Standard of Living Declines Under Stalin
The real value of Miss Gordon’s book is certainly not its political interpretation of Russian history, nor even the light it throws on the economic conditions in Russia under Czarism and prior to the beginning of the first Five Year Plan. Rather, it lies in the painstaking and detailed picture of the Russian standard of living since the introduction of the first Five Year Plan. And this, in spite of an inadequate economic analysis of the development of Russian industrial and agricultural production. No wonder the Stalinists have condemned the book. It constitutes a damning and irrefutable indictment of the Stalinist regime. At one stroke, out of official Stalinist sources, it destroys all the myths carefully nurtured by the kept Stalinist press and then: bourgeois dupes such as the Webbs and the Dean of Canterbury.
While production has increased considerably, the standard of living in this “paradise for workers,” conducted by the “genial and greatest of the great,” Stalin, has declined by about one-half since the introduction of the first Five Year Plan in October 1928. Facts are stubborn things, as Lenin was very fond of saying, and it is a fact that the standard of living of the Russian workers and masses has declined tremendously since Stalin came to power. No amount of fake statistics and idiotic rationalizations can get around this fact.
It requires a separate economic analysis to deal with the facts concerning the declining standard of living and the reasons for this phenomenon. Remember that Russia under Stalin represents the first country in the history of the world where a tremendous increase in industrialization has been accompanied by an equally tremendous decline in the standard of living.
Those who are interested in learning something about the real situation of the Russian workers today, about wages, nominal and real, housing, clothing, medical care, education, child and woman labor, food budgets, social security, the depreciation of the rouble, taxes, hours of work and conditions in the factories will read Workers Before and After Lenin. Those who wish to perpetuate their own illusions and demonstrate their ignorance in discussing the reality that is Russia today will ignore Miss Gordon’s book or shrug their shoulders and dismiss it as the work of an enemy of the Russian revolution. Genuine Marxists, however, will understand the value of Miss Gordon’s book for it has made available in English a valuable compendium of facts concerning the status of the Russian worker today.
 
 


Faced with the dilemma of serious price inflation or taking “steps in the direction of establishing totalitarian controls, the House of Representatives passed a weak-kneed compromise last Friday by, a vote of 224 to 161. After some fancy political maneuvering, the question of price control raised as long ago as last July, has now been referred to the Senate where, it is expected, a “real” price control bill will be passed.
The House bill declares that in the interests of “national defense” it is necessary to prevent price and credit inflation. Its provisions, however, cannot possibly achieve this objective. In fact, if the House bill becomes law it will definitely result in further substantial increases in prices. As always, the working people will suffer.
 
Farm Bloc Blackmail
The congressional farm bloc, operating in the interests of the rich commercial farmers, has put into the bill a provision concerning, the prices of farm products that constitutes one of the best illustrations of congressional blackmail in a long, long time. A ceiling is to be established on farm prices, but this upper limit cannot be lower than the highest of the following three levels:

A price equal to 110 per cent of parity;
The market price prevailing on October 1, 1941;
The average price for the period 1919–1929.

The original draft of the price control bill called for a ceiling on farm prices to be based on the price as of July 28, 1941, or 100 per cent of parity, whichever was higher. Parity, as I have previously explained, was the slogan of the Farm Bureau, to give the commercial farmers the same purchasing power as they possessed in the period from 1909–1914, which is the highest on record for the 20th century.
This meant, in many cases, price increases above those existing on July 28 running from 10 to 30 per cent. And, of course, prices on July 28 already reflected a substantial wartime inflation. While the House Banking and Currency Committee deliberately stalled for several months, under the pretext of a “thorough” consideration of the matter of price control, prices rose substantially. This prompted the farm bloc to demand that the prevailing price level be changed from July 28 to October 1. Not satisfied with this, and being in the position to hold up indefinitely any legislation at all unless its demands were granted, the farm bloc then raised the ante on the alternative parity ceiling from 100 per cent of parity to 110 per cent.
This means an additional 10 per cent increase for many basic farm prices.
 
The Third Wrinkle
Intoxicated with their easy success, the farm bloc introduced a third wrinkle. For some farm products, the average price from 1919 to 1929 was much higher than either 110 per pent of parity or the price on October 1. This is particularly true in the case of cotton. Where a ceiling based on the 1919–1929 average would mean an additional increase of some 30 per cent. The representatives from the cotton states demanded that this be included as a third alternative and the demand was granted.
As a result, the provision of the House Price Control Bill in regard to farm prices, far from preventing prices rises, actually guarantees tremendous price increases, amounting to a wage cut for the workers of at least 20 per cent.
As for prices of industrial products, the price administrator (it is assumed by everyone that Roosevelt will appoint Leon Henderson to this position) is permitted to set a ceiling, or a top price, on any commodity threatening to reach the “inflation point.” The effectiveness of this measure, in preventing inflation is exceedingly dubious. First of all an awful lot will depend on the judgment of one man, Leon Henderson. Even if he should be motivated by a sincere desire to prevent inflation, he still has virtually no power to do this, for the House bill establishes a five man board of review with broad power to overrule decisions by the price administrator. Moreover, a manufacturer or profiteer can appeal any case to the courts, where it could undoubtedly be dragged out for months or years. The provision giving the price administrator power to license business men and to revoke their licenses if they violated the price ceilings was defeated by the House. Thus, there is no effective means of enforcing any of these maximum prices.
 
Another Administration Defeat
The Administration suffered another, defeat on the proposal to give the government power to buy and sell any product in any market for the purpose of stabilizing its price. This provision was changed so that the government only has the power to buy and sell in the DOMESTIC market to stimulate production of HIGH-COST producers. This power cannot thus be used to lower prices. If used, it will only raise prices further.
A final provision of the bill permits the establishment of ceilings on rents in defense areas and gives such tenants the right of appeal if they think their rents are too high. This in no way will stop the rent gouge now going on in defense areas in view of the fact that the rents are already sky high. Nor will it help prevent a general rise in rents throughout the country, which is clearly indicated as a next step in the developing inflationary process.
About all that can be said in favor of the action of the House of Representatives is that the House recognizes the danger of inflation and is on record as being in favor, presumably, of doing something to prevent it.
 
Politics Behind the Bill
As important as the Price Control Bill itself is the politics which surrounded its passage by the House. It is clear that the question of inflation, which, of course, means the living standards of the masses, is to be the political football in the 1941 congressional elections. The Republicans hope to make a political comeback by accusing the Administration of being responsible for the failure to prevent inflation. They expect to escape the counter-charge that they sabotaged the Price Control Bill by claiming that they were for a “real” price control bill as introduced by Representative Gore. Gore’s bill, following the ideas of Bernard Baruch, called for an overall price ceiling on everything, including wages. This would be an exceptionally reactionary measure. The House had, at least, the political sense to defeat this proposal, for they knew how opposed the workers are to any attempt to control wages.
 
Now Before Senate
The Senate now become the next stage where the battle of inflation is to be fought. The workers, particularly the organized workers, must pay very close attention to the deliberations of the Senate. The representatives of the bosses will make every attempt to unload the tremendous cost of the war onto the workers. It is the desire of the bosses to maintain and increase profits that is the main driving force in bringing about rising prices and inflation. Every worker must see to it that his union takes action on this question.
The first demand of the unions must be for a 100 per cent excess profits tax. The second demand must be to limit all profits to a maximum of 6 per cent. The third demand must be for the establishment of workers’ control of prices!
Unless the workers take action along these lines, the fight to maintain living standards through wage increases will become a steadily losing fight.
 



The defense housing crisis is coming to a head. Newspapers are running articles on the situation; Congress has appointed committees of investigation. Within a few months the lid threatens to blow off on the biggest scandal since Teapot Dome. As an example of how serious the situation has become, it has been reliably reported in the capitalist press this past week that in one town in Connecticut where a lot of war factories are located over 700 children were found locked in automobiles or miserable shacks while their parents were working at jobs in nearby defense plants.
The background of the housing crisis is quite clear. For more than a decade, as depression took its deadly toll, the housing shortage has grown worse and worse. Private construction of homes and apartments dwindled to virtually zero. Government efforts at low-cost housing projects and slum clearance were confined to a few large cities, were far from low-cost and represented a feeble drop in the bucket. The estimate made several years ago that one-third of the nation is ill-housed is extremely conservative.
 
Workers Drift to Defense Centers
Then, as billions of dollars were spent for war orders, mostly concentrated in a handful of cities, workers began to drift in from all parts of the country to these few defense centers. The existing housing shortage in such towns was accentuated a thousandfold. Trailer camps, miserable shacks and hovels, sprang up like mushrooms after a rain on the outskirts of a score of cities. Rents boomed sky-high as the landlord’s and real estate interests took advantage of the tremendous demand for living quarters. Charles Abrams, of the New York Post, summarizes the effect of the housing crisis as follows:
“Today workers, unable to find quarters, are leaving their jobs in defense centers all over the country. Labor turnover exceeds 500 per cent in some vital areas. Skilled craftsmen in pivotal trades refuse to migrate because they might have to give half of their wages to landlords. Inefficiency, disaffection, work stoppages due to poor housing are already in evidence.”
The government’s handling of this situation is a monumental example of capitalist inefficiency, duplicity and downright skullduggery. It was admitted that there was a need for the construction of 525,000 homes this year in defense areas. Private industry obviously could not be relied upon to build homes for the vast majority of workers who earn less than $2,000 a year; for private industry will naturally only build homes if there is a profit in it – and there cannot be any profit in building homes for workers who get $30–$40 a week. Consequently, the government undertook the responsibility for constructing 70 per cent of these needed homes, or about 360,000 houses. Of this number, only 10 per cent has so far been built!
 
Too Many Fingers in the Pie
At the beginning of the armament program, the only real housing machinery in existence was the United States Housing Authority, which possessed 600 local branches spread over 38 states. But the USHA was not used at all in 1940 and is only partially used now. There are a dozen different agencies of the government which have their collective fingers in the housing pie. The Public Building Administration, the Division of Defense Housing, the Defense Homes Corporation are some of the more prominent examples of bureaucratic duplication. In addition, the Army, the Navy and the Farm Security Administration also managed to horn in on the housing pie.
Having tied itself up in a maze of red tape, the government tried to ease matters a bit by appointing Charles Palmer as Defense Housing Coordinator. Palmer, however, hasn’t done any coordinating at all. All he has done is to fight with the other two big-shots of the housing program, Nathan Straus, USHA Administrator, and John Carmody, Federal Works Administrator, who controls the Division of Defense Housing. Besides these eternal scraps, in which each accuses the other of incompetence and of sabotaging the defense program, Palmer’s main activity is seeing to it that as few government homes as possible are built. Palmer is typical of most of the officials in the “defense” program. He is a firm believer in private enterprise and doesn’t want to undermine it, even if this means that defense workers go without homes or live in slums.
Palmer, it must be emphasized, is President Roosevelt’s man, appointed directly by the President to the top position in the housing pyramid. His credo is “business as usual,” which phrase, given its proper translation, means “profits for the bosses.” In spite of his support of the system of “free, private enterprise,” Palmer is accused publicly by Carmody and others of being a dictator. Straus blames him for sponsoring “the most vicious piece of legislation that has been enacted in the field of housing, under the spur and drive of selfish private interests.” Needless to say, Palmer is aided and abetted in his work by the dollar-a-year OPM representatives of monopoly capital, who have needlessly placed priorities on building materials. This has forced up the price of building materials, with a consequent rise in rents and the price of homes. It has also resulted in some very fancy speculative activities in the construction field.
 
A Vicious Piece of Legislation
The legislation to which Straus referred is, indeed, one of the most vicious laws ever to come out of a servile Congress. It is known as the Lanham Act The ostensible purpose, of course, was to encourage housing. It permits the Federal Housing Authority to guarantee 90 per cent of builders’ mortgages on houses put up for defense workers. The effect of this provision has been to saddle workers with homes that they cannot possibly afford to keep. The workers are forced to buy them, even though they don’t want to, by being given the choice of being without a roof over their heads or buying these homes. In all such transactions, the builders and the bankers, who finance these homes, are given 100 per cent protection against any possible loss. The workers, of course, get no protection at all. Moreover, these are hardly low-cost affairs. The worker usually has to put down a payment of $100. His monthly payments, which take the place of rent, come to almost $60; when interest and taxes are included. To be able to afford such payments, a family should have a yearly income of close to $4,000 a year. Most of the workers who are forced to buy them, however, make half of this sum or less.
Another provision of the Lanham Act, which is equally vicious in this application, is the appropriation of funds to the Federal Works Administrator for defense housing, provided that building costs are not over an average of $3,500 per family. The maximum on any housing unit is set at $3,950 under this provision. Since it is virtually impossible to figure “average” costs in advance of construction, specifications are cut down to levels below minimum health standards. The net result is that in many cases the government is actually building slum houses for many defense workers.
 
And a Lot of Plain Graft
On top of these difficulties and abuses, there is obviously a considerable amount of plain, ordinary graft taking place. In some cases, sites for housing projects are located in swamps or places where sewage is disposed of. Local authorities are incensed in many cities over the fact that the federal agencies do not deem it necessary to consult local officials about the housing projects.
What the situation boils down to is that private industry cannot possibly build adequate homes for American workers. It is estimated that there is a real need for at least 12,000,000 housing units in this country today, for it should be obvious that it is not only the defense workers who need decent homes, but practically all workers. Unless the government immediately appropriates several billion dollars for real, low-cost housing projects (not the measly $300,000,000 that is being recommended) the overwhelming majority of workers will find that the “defense of democracy” means living in sub-standard dwellings. Democracy, it should be obvious, cannot thrive on slums which are injurious to the health.
Labor Action is anxious to expose the whole rotten mess of the housing scandal. Only the fresh air of truth and vigorous protests can get decent housing for the mass of Americans. We should appreciate it if any of our readers who have reliable information concerning the housing situation – any data on rents, etc. – would send it to us. We promise to give it prompt publicity.
 



If you own an airplane factory or some other factory producing materials needed for the prosecution of war, you may make a lot of money. If you own a lot of stocks and bonds, you may also make a lot of money. If you own some choice real estate, you may find it going up in value. In short, if you are a capitalist you may find that war CAN be profitable to some. But you must be a big capitalist. The small capitalists – the little business men and farmers – probably are going to be wiped out. Since, however, the vast majority of the population of these United States are workers, people who work for a living, let us examine, on the basis of past experience, what has been happening in other countries and what seems most likely to happen here: how your pocketbook will be affected by the entry of America into World War II.

Guns, Not Butter
“Guns – not butter.” This is the slogan that Hitler used to launch his so-called four-year plan in 1936. This was, in reality, his declaration of war to the world – a declaration that German imperialism was dissatisfied with its secondary position and was going to demand its “real place in the sun.” For the German workers, who already had had their trade unions smashed, their democratic rights violated, their leaders slaughtered and tortured in the concentration camps, there now began a period of unimaginable slavery. Hours of work were lengthened to at least 10 hours a day, and in many armament industries to 14 hours a day.
Wages remained stationary while prices began to creep up – not very much because the totalitarian government controlled them, but still enough in the case of essential products, like potatoes, to hurt. Then came the taxes and the “voluntary” contributions. On top of these came the ration cards, which meant one egg a week, when you were lucky, a half pound of meat and similar starvation rations. To make matters worse, most of the commodities that could be obtained were more and more of the “ersatz” variety – miserable substitutes that didn’t even take away the pangs of hunger or protect the body or the home against cold winters.
 
Labor Conscripted
Malnutrition, disease, poverty became the daily lot of the German worker. Finally, the insatiable war machine demanded not only cannon fodder in various parts of Europe and Africa, but it demanded workers. Even Hitler, powerful as he is, cannot ignore the fact that without workers nothing can be produced – not even armaments. So the German workers were conscripted to work in any part of the country. And not only the German workers, but a recent estimate shows that at least 2,000,000 foreign workers, French, Spanish, Italian, etc., have been conscripted to work in German war factories. Forced labor is slavery, as the German workers and the workers of the countries conquered by Germany have discovered.
But war is still profitable for some. While the German workers have been starving, they have been watching the big bosses, the Nazi bureaucrats, government officials and leading manufacturers still getting fat on rich foods while the workers have been living in homes calculated to give pneumonia even to the strongest, they have had to watch their leaders living in palaces and thriving in relative opulence.
Pretty much the same story has been true in England. There the workers not only had to shiver in the subways during the air raids while the big bosses retired to well constructed bomb shelters that took on the appearance of night clubs, but they also had to suffer the indignity of working and slaving and starving while the rich lived off the fat of the land. Our returning travelers from England, the congressmen and college professors, love to expatiate on the new spirit of “equality” in England, of how everybody is made equal by the ration card and huge taxes, but they always forget to mention or slide over in silence the scandalous fact that if you have a large pocketbook, you can still get all the good things in life. For there still flourishes the “black market,” the illegal paradise of the speculator and profiteer, where, for a price, you can buy as many chickens as you want.
 
Very Low Living Standards
It has been estimated – and these are very, very conservative estimates – that the standard of living of the average German worker today is well below what it was in 1932 at the worst point of the depression. In England, it has been estimated that the standard of living of the average British worker has declined by one-third since the outbreak of the war. The chances are it is nearer one-half. This is the picture of every country at war. It is as true of Japan, or Russia as it is of Germany and England. Will it also be true of the United States?
Judging by what has happened under the defense program and by what the new Victory program calls for, there can be no doubt that the answer is “yes.” That is, as long as the industrialists and bankers are allowed to run the war, it is bound to be the same in this country as in every other country. The masses will suffer – a few will profit. After all, if everybody suffered from war, what sense would there be in having war? It is the fact that some profit and others hope to profit that makes war possible. Assuming, then, that the dollar-a-year men remain in charge of our war effort, that the brass hats keep making their incredibly stupid mistakes, let’s see how the picture shapes up.
First of all, this is going to be a long war. That we have already been warned about. Plans are now under way to build up an army of 7,500,000 men. It may easily reach 10,000,000 before the war is over. Fifty per cent of our production will go to the war. It may easily be 60 or 70 per cent before the war is over. All men between the ages of 18 and 64 are to be registered. This may easily be extended to include women. Shortages have already appeared in such key raw materials as rubber, tin, gasoline, etc. These will be rationed. It may be and will be extended to others. Prices in the vital wholesale markets have gone up more than 60 per cent since the beginning of the war. They will go up further.
 
Cost of Living Jumps Here, Too!
The cost of living has gone up, according to government estimates, 11 per cent since the outbreak of the war. It will go up much, much further. There is an acute shortage of labor, particularly semi-skilled and skilled labor for the war industries. Other countries have drafted labor. The probability is that along with the outlawing of strikes there will come the conscription of labor in the U.S. – in spite of the fact that conscripting labor to work for the gain of a private employer is outlawed by the 13th amendment to the Constitution as slavery.
Goods are being standardized. This will continue and be extended to everything – that is, to everything except war materials. People are being urged to buy defense bonds and stamps. Soon they will be forced to buy them, as is already happening in some cases, “in the best interests of the workers,” simply deducting a certain sum from each worker’s pay check to go for this or some other type of forced savings. Substitutes are being introduced. This will be extended.
This picture is hot that of an alarmist. It is a very sober picture based on historical fact. The picture could be extended almost indefinitely to cover every last detail. The broad outlines are quite clear for anyone with eyes to see. But while the workers and masses are suffering a steadily declining standard of living, the same picture of the rich profiting by the war as exists in other countries will be duplicated here, only more so. Profits have gone up tremendously. They will still go up.
 



The Treasury Department has recommended to Congress the adoption of new taxes designed to raise slightly more than three and a half billion dollars – about half of the cost of the Lease-Lend program. While it is too early to say definitely what the final bill will be, as the various big business groups are now engaged in the highly edifying American pastime of passing the buck – on to consumers and other business groups – through their powerful lobbies in Washington, all the proposals made point to the strengthening of the already reactionary tax structure of the country.
While the capitalist press has headlined the scheduled increases in the income tax rates, the really significant aspect of the Treasury’s proposals are the additional $1,233,600,000 of indirect taxes. These are the taxes which are passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. The workers, those who can least afford it, will foot the largest portion of the bill designed to make the world safe for American imperialism. The middle class (those with incomes between $2,500 and $10,000) will pay the next largest share. And, as usual, the big capitalists will pay the smallest portion of the cost of their war.
Over $200,000,000 will be raised through additional tobacco taxes. This means that cigarettes will go up another two cents a pack. Almost the same sum is expected through a higher liquor tax. This means much higher prices for beer, wines, whiskey, etc. Over $842,000,000 will be obtained through excise taxes on some 25 items; some representing additional taxes on those already in existence, like another cent on each gallon of gasoline (expected to bring in $255,000,000); others representing entirely new taxes, like the proposed one cent a bottle on all soft drinks (expected to bring in $133,500,000). One and a half billion dollars is to be raised through additional income taxes by higher surtax rates on the middle income groups. For example, under the Treasury’s program a married couple with no children who have a net income of $2,500 a year would pay an income tax of $72 instead of the present $11. A single person with a net income of $1,000 who now pays an income tax of $4 would pay $29! Many of those in the middle class (around $5,000) will pay six to seven times their present income taxes.
Compare these proposals witt the measly additional $400,000,000 to be collected in excess profits taxes and you have a true picture of how the capitalists are trying to unload the cost of the war onto the backs of the workers and other people who work for a living. Especially, when it is recalled that the present excess profits lax, which was supposed to bring in close to a billion dollars in 1940 is now estimated as having brought in only $100,000,000!
While you are mulling over these typical illustrations of capitalist “justice,” let me spoil your appetite further with these additional items as food for thought:

Representative Doughton, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has charge of the bill, said he expected that “every conceivable tax” might be offered in the committee when it starts to “mark up” the bill within two or three weeks.
 
Under present tax schedules, those in the lowest income groups (representing two-thirds of the population) pay 20 per cent of their incomes to the government in taxes (most of them being hidden or indirect taxes) while those in the highest income group (representing one-tenth of one per cent of the population) pay only 38 per cent of their incomes to the government in taxes.
 
The new and increased excise taxes will have a cumulative effect in helping to bring about higher prices.

EVER SINCE THE UNITED STATES became a creditor nation in 1917, the specific weight of American imperialism in world affairs has steadily grown. The maturation of American capitalism during the decade of the 1920’s brought about significant structural developments within its anatomy. These developments have greatly influenced the growth of American imperialism and its influence on the course of world history. Nowhere is this more strikingly illustrated than in the present situation, which clearly centers around the war. It is with the hope of throwing some light on this key problem that this examination of the internal structure of the American bourgeoisie and its foreign investments is undertaken.
The fact that the capitalist class in a particular country is far from homogeneous is certainly not a new discovery. It goes back at least as far as Marx and was clearly understood and amplified by Lenin in his study of modern finance capitalist imperialism. Nevertheless, there has been a tendency within the Marxian movement (and, it goes without saying, amongst the bourgeois economists and historians) to minimize and even to overlook the importance of the various groupings within the bourgeoisie (determined essentially by the form and location of their capital accumulations – such as finance, banking, industrial, commercial and agricultural) and to treat the various national bourgeoisies as more or less homogeneous wholes.
In this fashion, half-truths are paraded as the last word in realistic analysis. The democratic bourgeoisies are interested in preserving their empires. The fascist bourgeoisies are interested in acquiring these empires. Everything becomes very simple – indeed, too simple. For, in spite of all the nationalistic propaganda that they and their agents have spewed forth, the modern (twentieth century) bourgeoisie is the most internationally-minded class that history has yet produced.
It is necessary to begin first with a brief presentation of economic data concerning American foreign investments, for these exports of surplus capital are most important in establishing the framework within which American imperialism must operate during the coming period.
“Prior to the present century American investments abroad were comparatively small. An estimate by Nathaniel T. Bacon placed American investments abroad in 1900 at $500,000,000 ... Charles F. Speare placed American investments abroad in 1909 at $2,020,000,000 and John B. Osborne estimated them at $1,902,500,000 for 1912.” (Moody’s 1940 Manual of Investments). Thus, even before World War I, American capitalism was casting about for a more profitable outlet for its surplus capital accumulations. The war of 1914–1918 greatly accelerated the process. In the decade from 1912–1922, American foreign investments increased 300 per cent. Moreover, in the course of this phenomenal increase, a profound change took place in the structure of American imperialism – a change which was a direct result of the war. From a debtor nation ever since its origin, the United States became in 1917 a creditor nation.
 
Growth of American Investments
During the period of the First World War most of the financial interests of American imperialism, consisting of financial loans, trade and investments, were in Europe, and most of these were in England. But in the course of the subsequent two decades, many changes have taken place in the foreign investment position of American capital. While different sources give different estimates of the amounts invested abroad, the most official figures available are those of the Department of Commerce. These show a steady rise until 1931, as follows (these figures are based on conditions existing on January 1 of the given year):



Year

1922


$8,020,000,000




1923

1924

1928

1929


13,973,000,000




1930


14,764,000,000




1931


15,170,000,000



This decade, in other words, represents the heyday of American imperialism. Foreign investments increased almost 100 per cent and reached the huge absolute figure of more than 15 billion dollars (some estimates place it as high as 18 billions). Interest payments and dividends on these investments annually ran to more than a billion dollars, a substantial item in the international balance of payments. The American octopus had extended its tentacles over virtually the entire globe. In so doing, it had produced some important qualitative changes. Investments in Europe remained more or less the same. The big increase occurred in the Western Hemisphere.
A survey made by Fortune in July 1931 gives the following figures for the year 1929-1930:



Location


Amount




Europe


$5,000,000,000




Western Hemisphere


$9,350,000,000




(Latin America – $5,500,000,000)
(Canada – $3,850,000,000)




Far East


$1,300,000,000




(Asia – $900,000,000)
(Australia – $400,000,000)




Africa


$100,000,000




Total


$15,750,000,000



Note well that investments in Latin America now exceeded those in Europe. Important as this change is, its full significance only becomes apparent during the decline of about $4,000,000,000 that took place in American foreign investments during the decade of the 1930’s. From the beginning of 1931, the decline is steady, most of it being recorded in the first six years of this decade. The Department of Commerce (July 1940) records a total foreign investment of American capital at the end of 1939 of $11,365,000,000.
If one compares the proportionate amounts invested in different geographical areas in 1929 and in 1939, then the changes are quite striking:



Area

The fact which emerges as predominant is that 70 per cent of America’s foreign investments are in the Western Hemisphere, as World War II confronts American imperialism with even more decisive questions than did World War I. Moreover, the decline in the absolute amount of capital invested in Europe (which is more than 50 per cent during the last decade) has undoubtedly been accelerated during the past year as the Nazis have attempted to put their grossraumwirtschaft into operation in Europe.
 
Banking Capital Asserts Itself
In the case of World War I, American investments were largely in Europe. In the case of World War II, American investments are overwhelmingly in the Western Hemisphere. World War I saw America emerge as the dominant imperialist power of the world; almost, but not quite, “master of the world,” as Mr. Thomas W. Lament of the House of Morgan had hoped. During the decade of the 1920’s, American imperialism put Europe on rations and extended its sway through-out the world, especially in the Western Hemisphere. The decade of the 1930’s saw American imperialism enter into the period of decline that has characterized world capitalism as a whole since 1914, and many readjustments were forced upon it both internally and externally. Not the least of these was the necessity of relinquishing the attempt to reduce Europe to the status of a colonial dependency of the United States. The Western Hemisphere was found to be a more profitable and safer field for exploitation than Europe. Here, in reality, lies the origin of Roosevelt’s “Good Neighbor” policy and the imperative necessity for the Act of Havana. The position of American imperialism vis-à-vis World War II is clearly not quite the same as was its relation to World War I.
American capitalism entered the highest stage of its development – the imperialist stage – during the last years of the nineteenth century. Two events, among many, signalled the emergence of the brash youth from its precocious adolescence into the estate of manhood amongst the capitalist nations of the world. They were the Spanish-American War and the formation of the gigantic billion dollar monopoly, the United States Steel Corporation in 1901. The first event served notice on all competitors that American imperialism could not be ignored in any distribution or redistribution of the world’s markets, colonies or spheres of influence. The second event served to emphasize and to punctuate the importance of the first. When the canny Scot, Andrew Carnegie, sold his industrial properties to the successful banker, J.P. Morgan, the process of merging banking capital with industrial capital came to a climax and then continued on a grand scale. American imperialism throughout the twentieth century is thus characterized by the domination of finance capital.
The fusion of banking capital with industrial capital to form finance capital does not disclose the same story in each case. On the contrary, two major trends can be noted in the United States. The more classic case is that of banking capital, through its role as promoter, invading the field of industry. Occasionally by outright purchase, but more often by various forms of intimidation and pressure, it secured control of various industries. The outstanding example of this method is, of course, the Morgan interests. The National Resources Committee in its study of The Structure of American Economy (1939) estimates that there are eight large interest groups. Of these, what is called the Morgan-First National group is by far the largest. Corporations directly controlled by this group possess assets of more than $30,000,000,000.
The other major method by which finance capital evolves is best exemplified by the Rockefeller interest group. Capital is originally accumulated in the field of industry or mining (in this case, oil). It expands until the pressure of accumulated surplus reserves and the struggle for survival and domination force it to acquire control of banking capital. In 1930, for example, the Rockefellers bought into the Chase National Bank and, through the help of the Banking Act of 1933, established Mr. Rockefeller’s son-in-law, Winthrop W. Aldrich, as chairman of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors was pruned and reorganized with the object of forcing the Morgan men out. Today, the Chase National Bank, with total assets of three and one-half billion dollars, is the largest bank in the world and is clearly a Rockefeller-controlled institution.
The total assets of the 50 largest banks in the country plus the 200 largest non-financial corporations are approximately $100,000,000,000, or almost one-half of the total national wealth. The eight finance capital groups, Morgan-First National, Rockefeller, Kuhn-Loeb, Mellon, Chicago, DuPont, Cleveland, and Boston, control 62 per cent of the assets of this list of the principal 250 corporations. In a very measurable sense, therefore, finance capital controls the United States.
 
The Morgan-Rockefeller Groups
Within these eight major interest groups, the two most important, especially from the point of view of their ability to influence domestic and foreign policy, are the Morgan and Rockefeller groups. The other six groups generally occupy a position subordinate to the two main groups. Moreover, the Morgan and Rockefeller groups were the first to appear on the historical scene as important molders of policy. To a large extent the history of the United States during the first part of its finance imperialist phase (1890–1917) is a history of the conflicts between these two groups. Following World War I, however, during the phenomenal expansion of American imperialism in the 1920’s, many changes took place within the anatomy of American imperialism. These left their mark on the Morgan and Rockefeller groups.
The fairly sharply defined Morgan and Rockefeller groups have given way, as a result of a maze of interlocking directorates formed under relentless pressure by the requirements of monopolistic competition, to loose, informal groupings of “friendly enemies.” Both the Morgan and Rockefeller families have declined tremendously in importance. The dominant figures in both groups are chiefly successful business men who have demonstrated by their ability and success their right to positions of leadership within the American bourgeoisie. Changes are made as often as circumstances require within this leadership. That which gives these groups continuity is their more or less respectively similar interests plus the perpetuation of the Morgan name in close association with one group and the Rockefeller name with the other. The original antagonisms between the Morgan group and the Rockefeller group, based on the conflict between finance capital and industrial capital, have not been completely obliterated. They still remain latent and, on occasion, burst into the open. Both groups, today, are full-fledged finance capital groups. But, because of the nature of their origins, their investments are not identical. The Rockefeller group, wherever a conflict arises between industrial capital and finance capital, is inclined towards the industrial capital position. The Morgan group, however, even though its industrial interests are larger than its banking interests, is both in origin and outlook a banking group. Hence, whenever a conflict arises between industrial capital and finance capital, as more genuine finance capitalists, the Morgans incline towards the banker’s point of view.
Labor policy, price policy, the New Deal and domestic politics, as well as foreign policy, have, on occasion, served as battlegrounds between the two groups. The Rockefellers and their allies have been much firmer in their insistence on an open shop policy than the Morgans. They have pursued a much more rigid, inflexible price policy than the latter. They have been openly anti-New Deal, whereas the Morgans have varied in their attitude, at times being quite friendly to the Roosevelt Administration. The Rockefellers have concentrated more and more on the Republican Party, while the Morgans have continued their interest in both political machines. Finally, the original appeasement sentiment in this country (after the outbreak of the war) was pretty much concentrated in the Rockefeller group.
If one considers solely American direct investments abroad (this type of capital investment is the more stable and, other things being equal, will more likely influence policy than portfolio or short-term investments), the reason for the cleavage on foreign policy between the two major groups within the American capitalist class that ran from the outbreak of World War II until almost the date of the 1940 election appears to be quite clear. At the end of 1936 (whatever shifts have taken place since are relatively minor and can only serve to reinforce the general picture which I am presenting), 72 per cent of American direct investments were in the Western Hemisphere, 18 per cent were in Europe, and the remaining 10 per cent were largely in the Far East. Manufacturing, public utilities and transportation investments are chiefly Morgan. Petroleum, mining and smelting are chiefly Rockefeller. An analysis of the location of these different types of investments reveals that the bulk of the investments in Europe are Morgan-controlled; the bulk of the investments in the Far East are Rockefeller-controlled. Both groups have very important in-vestments in the Western Hemisphere.
From what I have said above, the following conclusions seem to be indicated:

The most successful policy that American imperialism can pursue is one that will secure the maximum agreement within the American bourgeoisie. So far as foreign investments are concerned, this means that the cornerstone of American policy must be the protection of the 70 per cent of American investments in the Western Hemisphere. For it is here that all groups of American imperialists have important interests. The alliance with Canada, the Act of Havana, the creation of the Pan-American Bank, the granting of a $500,000,000 capital to the Export-Import Bank for loans to Latin America, the military plans for Hemisphere “Defense,” these are virtually the only items in American foreign policy today that have the unanimous approval of all sections of the American bourgeoisie.
 
While all American imperialists are interested in the Western Hemisphere, some are not particularly interested in Europe or the fate of England. Others are. The House of Morgan, for example, is vitally interested in defending England. More is involved here than the simple fact that the Morgans have considerable investments in England. England (the City of London) has been the world center of international trade, the focal point from which finance capital throughout the world operates. If England goes under, not only do the Morgans lose considerably in wealth, power and prestige, but world finance imperialism will be considerably shaken. If it lies within the power of Morgan and those financial interests allied with him, history will repeat itself. America will enter World War II for the same laudable purpose as last time – to protect American trade with and investments in England.
 
Some American imperialists are more worried about the threat offered by Japanese imperialism than that offered by German imperialism. They are not only the ones who have the chief stake in the Far East, but who, above all, see in the Far East a great potential sphere of interest. This vast market, embracing almost one-half of the world’s population, possesses unlimited opportunities for capital investment, securing raw materials, and for trade. It is in the Far East that the destiny of American imperialism lies, in their opinion.
 
These difference within the ranks of American imperialists, plus the course of the war to date, have forced the Roosevelt Administration to operate on the basis of the least common denominator between the two major groupings of American imperialists – Hemisphere “Defense.” The immediate purpose of an army of 4,000,000 American conscripts is likely to be as an army of occupation throughout the strategic points of the Western Hemisphere.
 
The aim of American imperialism in this war must be complete mastery of the world. Or, in the words of Wendell Willkie, a Morgan man if there ever was one in American politics: “After this war, the capital of the world will either be in Berlin or in Washington.” But there are still some differences of opinion within the bourgeoisie on how this program of world domination is to be accomplished.
 

The War and Group Unity
The continued resistance of England, which gives currency to the forecasts of a type of Napoleonic war, has strengthened the Morgan hand. Their task now is to involve the United States in the war in a military manner as quickly as feasible. To do this, they must, if possible, cement their agreements with the Rockefellers. The government, therefore, must increasingly represent, for the bourgeoisie, a regime of national unity. Roosevelt has already taken the first steps in this direction. His appointments of Stimson and Knox, two Republicans, to the key cabinet positions of War and Navy, were more than a clever election maneuver. It was the first step in the direction of a government of national unity. The personnel of the National “Defense” setup is steadily broadened out to embrace all sections of finance capital. Aside from Stettinius, with his Morgan link, and Knudsen, with his Morgan-DuPont link, one of the most significant of recent appointees has been that of Nelson Rockefeller to the position of Coordinator of Cultural Relations with Latin America.
In general, the crisis of capitalism requires more and more constant intervention on the part of the capitalist state in the affairs of business. This is what Lenin called the domestic counterpart of modern finance imperialism – the development of state monopoly capitalism. An additional reason for the hastening of this process is that an immediate solution, in view of the war situation, for these internecine conflicts within the bourgeoisie is required – and only the capitalist state can solve them.
Along with this growing unification of the capitalist class within the capitalist state will come the hammering out of a clearly defined policy of action for American imperialism, both in regard to domestic affairs and foreign policy. Its out-lines have already been clearly indicated by Roosevelt during the past year. Price policy is to be dictated by the capitalist state in the interests of the entire capitalist class – witness the establishment of a price ceiling in steel. Prices are no longer to be subject to the vagaries of the market, as influenced by the necessities of fratricidal warfare amongst the capitalists. Profits will not be ignored. Far from it. They will now be guaranteed by the capitalist state at a higher level than the capitalists could hope to maintain by themselves in “normal” times. Along with and as a result of this tendency small business will be completely wiped out. The American industrial structure will be streamlined along the lines of 100 per cent monopoly. Since time does not permit, those industrialists who insist on the patriotic necessity of crushing labor in order to improve the war effort, will be forced by the capitalist state to acquiesce in Roosevelt’s policy of an alliance with labor, modeled after the British setup – witness the establishment of the National Defense Mediation Board and the manner of settling the Bethlehem, Ford and Harvester strikes. Foreign policy is now well formulated – witness the passage of the Lease-Lend Bill and other more recent steps and the enthusiastic approval given to these measures by the outstanding spokesmen for both the Morgan and Rockefeller groups. German imperialism is the main threat and must be defeated at all costs. This will take care of Japan and, incidentally, in the process of “helping” England, British imperialism will become subservient to the greater interests of American imperialism.
The tendency which was exhibited by industrial capital in France towards appeasement and towards conserving its direct investments by avoiding the defense of Paris cannot be expected here. Finance capital is too cosmopolitan, too broad in its outlook to take such a narrow view of its interests. The paucity of investments in the Far East and Africa, as well as Europe, dictates to American imperialism a policy of attempting to achieve world domination. This policy is reinforced by the tremendous pressure being exerted by untold billions of surplus capital lying idle within the country, and by the constantly growing pressure of an expanding armaments economy – which more and more exhibits a tendency to become permanent. We will not enter a foreign war, says President Roosevelt, “except in case of attack.” But American imperialist interests have already been attacked by Germany and Japan. They will be more so in the near future. How soon, then, will it be before there is another Lusitania incident, before Roosevelt and the rest of the capitalist propagandists have the pretext or invent the pretext of “attack” by a foreign power and America is launched in actual military participation in World War II?

The Treasury Department has announced that before the end of the year a comprehensive plan will be introduced into Congress for cutting down the “excess” purchasing power of the American masses. The central feature of this “anti-inflationary” program will be a tremendous increase in social security payroll taxes. The figure of 5 per cent has been publicly mentioned.
At present, employee members of the old age pension system automatically have 1 per cent of their wage deducted from their pay envelopes. This sum, together with the employer’s contribution an equal sum for each worker, goes toward the creation of a survivor’s insurance fund. When a worker reaches the age of 65 he is then entitled to certain benefit payments for the rest of his life.
This system, known as social security, was originally designed to solve the problem of old age insecurity. It is not to be confused with another aspect of the same law – unemployment insurance – which operates through the states. In spite of numerous flaws and injustices, social security was generally accepted as a step in the right direction. Now, however, under the pressure of tremendous war expenditures, this system is to be perverted into a means for making the masses pay for the boss war, lowering the standard of living of the average worker and, ultimately, destroying the old age pension system.
Just exactly what changes are being discussed by those entrusted with the safeguarding of our money is difficult to say, as it doesn’t seem to occur to Mr. Morgenthau and Mr. Roosevelt that the workers ARE interested in the fate of their own pension system, and would like to have a public discussion of any proposals that are being made. It has been rumored, for example, that the social security system is to be broadened to include many not now covered, as farmers and government employees. If the “contribution” of the worker is to be increased to 5 per cent (and this apparently is the smallest figure under consideration), will the contribution of the employer also be increased to 5 per cent? Absolute silence from Treasury officials! If the workers contribute five times as much as previously, will their benefits increase by five times? No answer! Will the benefits increase at all? Still no answer, but one detects an embarrassed silence such as is usually present when you apprehend a person in the act of doing something wrong.
Above all, what relevance has it to the needs of the working class? There are now millions upon millions of dollars in the social security fund, of which about 90 per cent has been “borrowed” by the government for war purposes. The new proposal is therefore obviously designed not to safeguard the security of the worker but to get more money for the bosses’ war!
The bosses undoubtedly figure that this subject is too “complicated” for the average worker to understand. It involves such matters as inflation, taxation and finance. The worker, in the mind of the boss, is too dumb to discuss these matters; he should merely concern himself with sweating, toiling and bleeding so that the bosses can make more profits, and he should leave these mysterious matters to the representatives of the bosses, like Mr. Morgenthau, who will take care of everything.
Suppose, however, that somebody proposed that you take a 5 per cent wage cut. You would want to discuss it, wouldn’t you, especially with the wife complaining that the cost of everything is going sky-high? And even if you were told that by taking a 5 per cent wage cut, you would be stopping prices from going up, we are absolutely confident that the workers would want to discuss such a proposal. And yet, this, in reality, is what is being proposed. Of course, the bosses don’t say that this is a wage cut. They will tell you that you will be saving your money and that you will get it back when the “emergency” is over, when you’ll need it.
 
The Keynes Plan
This is the line that the bosses of England are handing out to the British workers. There, a famous economist by the name of John Maynard Keynes, who is concerned with the problem of making capitalism work, proposed at the beginning of the war his “deferred savings” plan. The trouble, says Mr. Keynes, is that under a war economy less and less of the necessities of life are produced. The war needs the factories and the machines, the raw materials and the labor. So we are forced to cut down on production of consumer goods. At the same time, more workers are being employed in the war industries. This means more money in the hands of the workers. In other words, the demand for consumer goods is, increasing at the same time that the supply is being reduced. Such a situation must result in rising prices – that is, in inflation.
This is bad, so the only solution, according to Mr. Keynes, is to reduce the demand of the workers for the necessities of life. Let 5 per cent of the worker’s wage be deducted from his payroll. This will be a sort of forced savings. The government can use this money to finance the cost of the war. Then, when the war is over, the money which the worker loaned the government will be returned to him, and there will be a big demand so that manufacturers will find it profitable to produce consumer goods once again. England has adopted the Keynes “deferred savings” plan. As a reward, Mr. Keynes was just elected as one of the directors of the Bank of England.
Mr. Keynes made a trip to the United States earlier this year. At that time, it was reported that he had discussed his plan with Treasury officials. Apparently, we are now to receive the fruits of this visit. For, it should be obvious that an increase of the social security tax to 5 per cent is merely a different form of carrying out the same basic idea.
At the same time that Mr. Morgenthau made his announcement in Washington, a small item in the financial section of the newspapers announced that Dr. Fritz Reinhardt, assistant Finance Minister of Germany, had proposed to the German workers the development of “iron savings accounts.” These accounts cannot be touched until one year after the war is over. The amount that an individual worker can save is limited and is tax exempt. We do not know if Mr. Keynes made a trip to Berlin in order to expound his theories to the Nazis, but we do know that the Nazis have adopted and perfected his theories. We also know that if the German system is compulsory savings, as the American press was quick to point out, then Mr. Morgenthau’s proposal is also compulsory savings, in spite of his denial.
 
Lowers Living Standard
We object to the proposal of increased social security taxes because it is unnecessary, because it will not prevent inflation and because, ultimately, it will wreck the social security system. It is unnecessary because a genuine, democratic approach to the problem of preventing inflation would start with a real 100 PER CENT EXCESS PROFITS TAX. If it is not profitable to raise prices (because the extra profits will be taken away through taxes), the biggest incentive that the bosses have to raise prices will be destroyed. Further, this American adaptation of the Keynes scheme will not prevent inflation, unless at the same time, rigid totalitarian controls are introduced. By themselves, forced savings can only mean a LOWER STANDARD OF LIVING and will throw the main burden of financing the war onto the backs of the masses.
Finally, the question must be asked: where will the government get the money to pay back these forced savings, once the war is over? The answer is that it can’t unless it pays back in inflated dollars, which would mean a worthless currency. We shall return again to this question. Meanwhile let’s hear from our readers and let every worker raise the problem in his trade union!
 



American Industry in the War
by Bernard M. Baruch
New York, Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1941. 498 pp.
ALONG LAST, Mr. Baruch, Wall Street speculator, big business man, financial advisor to the duPonts, formulator of the “M-Day” plans and one of the outstanding representatives of the American bourgeoisie, has set forth his views on war economics. It is not a book intended for mass consumption. The circulation of American Industry in the War will undoubtedly be limited to libraries, serious economists, a few Washington bureaucrats and perhaps a handful of Marxists. This is not to say that Mr. Baruch’s book is not deserving of wider circulation. It is. First of all, it is a useful reference book concerning some phases of America’s economic mobilization during World War I. Secondly, and above all, it contains Mr. Baruch’s program for the administration of the American war economy during World War II.
The book is invaluable as a class-conscious presentation of the point of view of the bourgeoisie. Just how representative of the opinion of the big bourgeoisie Mr. Baruch is, is difficult to say. But it is not without significance that the newspapers continue to report Baruch’s visits to Roosevelt, that the Canadian plan for preventing inflation, involving the freezing of all prices, including wages, is openly referred to in the American press as an experiment to determine the validity of Baruch’s ideas, and that Representative Gore’s plan, which also involves an overall ceiling on prices (wages included), is admittedly inspired by Baruch.
Baruch starts with the assumption that war, especially modern war, is a very serious business. He says in his foreword:
Total defense must plan to fight, to win and above all to survive war. This means some plan along lines similar to the experience tested by the United States War Industries Board of 1917 and 1918. It must mobilize men. money, materials, morale – all resources – to give to the war-making agencies and those allied with them, such as shipping and blockade, what they want when they want it, without unnecessary deprivation or exploitation of civilians.
Thus Baruch knows, and the experiences of the last war and of this one to date confirm him, that capitalist imperialist war in the epoch of the decline of capitalism necessarily involves totalitarian economic and political forms – that is, if the war is to be prosecuted successfully. Everything must be at the service of the state. The employment of all resources, material as well as human, must be planned. “Business as usual” must give way to “all-out” defense. To be sure, exploitation as usual will remain, but it must not be insensate and too grasping. Moderation, centralized direction, efficiency – that is the only way to preserve capitalism.
This thesis runs through the book from the very first page to the last. That it involves a lower standard of living for the masses, increased power for monopoly capital, and complete control of all aspects of life in the hands of an all-powerful administration in Washington is perhaps regrettable. But, and Mr. Baruch is 100 per cent correct, reasoning from the basic premise of preserving capitalism, this is inevitable. Mr. Baruch does not use the famous phrase adopted by Marxists from the German general, von Clausewitz: “War is a continuation of politics by other means.” However, he clearly understands the content of this expressive sentence. He is trying to convey its meaning to his fellow-capitalists, to persuade them, in other words, to continue their politics, their exploitation of the workers, by methods adapted to the war.
 
“Taking Profit Out of War” – A Deception
Baruch calls his plan, written in magazine form as long ago as 1931: “A plan to mobilize effectively the resources of the nation for war which shall eliminate war profiteering, prevent wartime inflation, and equalize wartime burdens.” To mobilize the country’s resources, Baruch would extend and improve upon the methods used in the last war. On the subject of eliminating war profiteering – that is, on how to accomplish it – he is delightfully vague. But we shouldn’t be too harsh. After all, it sounds nice. In fact, Mr. Baruch originally entitled his plan: Taking the Profit Out of War. It is enough that a representative of finance capital realizes the necessity for keeping profits down to a respectable level. On page 380, for example, he says: “The inflationary process affords opportunity to individuals and corporations to reap profits so large as to raise the suggestion (sic!) of complacency if not of actual hospitality toward the idea of war.”
We shouldn’t expect him to propose a practical plan (like a 100 per cent excess profits tax, or government ownership of all war industries) for achieving this admittedly desirable aim. Nor should we be surprised that Mr. Baruch didn’t find his conscience plaguing him when he advised the duPonts to take their millions of dollars of war profits and buy 10,000,000 shares of General Motors common stock. In other words, for purposes of preserving popular morale, the bourgeoisie should not be too greedy. Otherwise, the masses may begin to suspect the truth. “These people actually favor war because they profit from it,” the workers will be saying to themselves; and such thoughts are what the Japanese would characterize as “dangerous” thoughts. Says Baruch:
Our plans should eliminate war profiteering and they ought to provide that each man, thing and dollar shall bear its just proportion of the burden. They should be designed to avoid the prostrating economic and social aftermath of war and, finally, they should be laid with full recognition that modern war is a death grapple between peoples and economic systems rather than a conflict of armies alone, and to that end we should merit for industrial America something of what Field Marshal von Hindenburg in his retrospect of the World War had to say of its efforts in 1918: “Her brilliant, if pitiless, war industry had entered the service of patriotism and had not failed it. Under the compulsion of military necessity a ruthless autocracy was at work (my italics – F.D.) and rightly, even in this land at the portals of which the Statue of Liberty flashes its blinding light across the seas. They understood war.” (Page 377)
The purposes and methods of capitalist war are clearly understood by the bourgeoisie, German as well as American. Would that they were as clearly understood by the workers! That would truly succeed in abolishing war.
 
The Nazis Adopt American Plan
This profound respect and admiration that Baruch has for German bourgeois and military opinion is seen in another connection, which is more revealing of what the American war economy has in store for us this time than any other single sentence from anyone’s pen. In his foreword, after pointing out that France fell because she lacked real economic mobilization, and that England is having difficulties because she is only partially mobilized, the author says with considerable triumph: “German military experts have said, ‘Except for a few minor changes, the German economic mobilization system was conscientiously built in imitation of the similar American system.’” (My italics – F.D.) What happened, apparently, was that the lectures that Baruch and others gave to the American War College in the period around 1931 were later formulated as the “M-Day” plans and published for the edification of American bourgeois and military opinion. The Nazis, never loathe to borrow an idea which they could use to advantage, borrow the American mobilization plans in toto. Perhaps this explains the eager, and yet wishful, manner in which the American General Staff follows the progress of the German armies. One begins to suspect that is more a matter of the author’s pride than of advancing American military science. Be that as it may, a system which is good for the Nazis cannot be very good for the preservation of the democratic way of life!
“War is economically the greatest and most scandalous of spendthrifts” (p. 74). “This sapping of economic strength will, in future wars, be the determining cause of defeat” (p. 380). “In modern war, administrative control must replace the law of supply and demand” (p. 382). Here, in three brief sentences, is expressed all the wisdom of the bourgeoisie and, at the same time, their complete bankruptcy in the face of social problems that have outgrown the confines of private ownership of property and production for profit. The capitalist class, in the interests of its own self-preservation, is compelled to waste the “blood, sweat and toil” of the masses. It dooms humanity to incalculable exhaustion. No one can predict how many years it will take to recover from the devastation wrought by World War II. One thing is certain, however: the law of supply and demand (free, competitive capitalism and its political superstructure, bourgeois democracy) is doomed. It is not merely a question of its temporary suspension during the war. The World War, which is now threatening to make the last war appear as a localized incident, will bring in its wake proletarian revolution on an international scale and the tremendous leap forward toward socialism, or totalitarian state monopoly capitalism (fascism). Mr. Baruch has a premonition of this, although, of course, he cannot bring himself to say it clearly and openly, when he says (on page 104): “This legislation (anti-trust legislation – F.D.), while valuable for immediate purposes, represents little more than a moderately ambitious effort to reduce by government interference the processes of business so as to make them conform to the simpler principles sufficient for the conditions of a bygone day.” (My italics – F.D.)
 
Inflation and the War Economy
As for preventing inflation, all that can be said for Mr. Baruch is that he at least recognizes it as an inevitable accompaniment of capitalist war. His plan to prevent it is thoroughly reactionary and, in the long run, will not succeed in preventing inflation. The Baruch plan, known as the overall price ceiling, would simply freeze all prices as of a certain day and use the government’s powers of compulsion to enforce this 100 per cent totalitarian idea. In his own words (page 473): “When industry has reached full capacity and price-fixing is admittedly necessary, this ceiling should be clamped down, and all prices, wages, rents and other forms of remuneration limited to the highest levels obtaining on a certain specific day.” This, of course, involves freezing existing inequalities, accepting the capitalist concept of full capacity as the most effective economic organization possible, and instituting such far-reaching totalitarian controls as to make present-day Germany look like a democracy. But it will not prevent inflation. It will create a huge governmental bureaucracy and possibly slow down the rapid drive toward inflation, but as long as private appropriation of the fruits of other people’s labor remains (that is, while the capitalist system remains), it can only result in a concealed inflation, as Germany has discovered. Rapidly rising prices will give way to rapidly deteriorating quality in merchandise, to vast (and, unofficially, government-organized) “black bourses” or bootleg markets, where capitalists and government bureaucrats, who have the fat pocketbooks, can still live off the fat of the land. It will mean widespread corruption, such as to make the carpet bag era following the Civil War a model of virtue and restraint.
As for equalizing wartime burdens, Mr. Baruch expresses an admirable sentiment when, in the only place where he expatiates on this point, he says (page 469): “The need for preserving civilian morale forbids that necessities should be given only to those with the longest pocketbook. For this reason, food, clothing and all other vital elements that go to make up the cost of living, if they become scarce, must be rationed equitably among all consumers. The most satisfactory method is a system of ration cards together with the licensing of wholesale and retail distributors.” True, but you can’t make capitalism equitable, by decree or otherwise. However, Mr. Baruch is not particularly serious about this, or, if he is, he has his own, or capitalist, concept of social justice. For the major part of his book is devoted to a report of the War Industries Board, submitted in 1921, where Baruch cites with approval virtually all the experiences, dealing with virtually every commodity, of the Board, of which he was chairman. And, as every schoolchild knows, the conduct of the American war economy in World War I by the War Industries Board was hardly distinguished by its fairness and equal distribution of wartime burdens.
 
The Warning to Labor
It is when he comes to labor that Baruch, the industrialist, loses some of his objective pose. The mailed fist inches out of the white kid glove. Strikes, of course, are taboo, but the capitalists “shouldn’t take advantage of labor.” (That is, they should stop being capitalists.) Conscription of labor is not to be countenanced (Messrs. Bevin and Hillman, please take note!). The argument is rather interesting. “As long as our present industrial organization maintains, industry is in the hands of millions of private employers. It is operated for profit to them. The employee therefore serves in private industry operating for gain. Enforced and involuntary service for a private master is and has been clearly and repeatedly denned by our Supreme Court as slavery inhibited by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States” (page 471). But, if the capitalist state drafts industry, as it has the power to do, and as is proposed in the “M-Day” plans, which Mr. Baruch inspired, won’t the state then have the “right” to conscript labor?
Mr. Baruch can never forget that he is a class-conscious bourgeois. Time and again it creeps out and destroys his “impartial, patriotic” approach. No better illustration is needed than the following: “The war had scarcely begun when the IWW, stimulated no doubt by the enemy, appeared as a menacing factor, particularly in the mountain regions and on the Pacific Coast” (page 88 – my italics – F.D.). How long will it be before government officials openly substitute the letters CIO for IWW?
American Industry in the War will be studied carefully by those who wish some factual information concerning the last war (the book, incidentally, has some valuable appendices) and by those who want to obtain first-hand the mature opinion of the most advanced sections of the American capitalist class. It will be ignored by those who wish to preserve their illusions concerning the “democratic” organization of a capitalist war economy.
 
 


On May 28, June 26 and July 10, 1940, Stalin’s Council of Peoples’ Commissars of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued three decrees which subject the workers of Russia to a vicious slavery. These decrees represent the first fruits for the Russian workers of Stalin’s debacle in Finland, and the alliance with Hitler fascism.
 
The First Decree
The first of these decrees, that of foremen in most of the heavy indirect equivalent in every sense of a superintendent in a capitalist factory. He is to be considered the leader in that portion of the shop over which he has jurisdiction. He has full power in regard to the work assigned to him and bears complete responsibility for the carrying out of this work. The workers will now receive their orders through the foreman exclusively. The foreman now has the power to hire and fire all workmen, with the approval of the head of the department in question. The foreman is given the power to punish workers guilty of interfering with labor discipline. He pays out the wages of the workers. The foreman controls production and changes in production. He is expected to see to it that his workers are properly placed, given the proper tools, and properly instructed so as to produce the maximum amount possible.
Since the foreman is now to occupy such an important position in Russia, he is to be chosen from among engineers, technicians, or highly qualified workmen. As a reward for administering Stalin’s whip over the workers, the wages of foremen were raised, starting June 1, so as to be higher than the average wage of qualified workmen. This means, at the very least, a doubling of wages for foremen. Already functioning foremen, without the necessary technical education, as well as newly appointed foremen, must pass a test given by the Committee of Attestations. In the usual propaganda blast which accompanied this decree, it is indicated that those previously in positions of management were distinguished by a lack of culture and general ignorance. “Proletarian origin” will no longer be a major qualification, or indeed a recommendation, for holding a managerial position, in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Now the heads of departments and factory directors, as well as the practical workers without formal education, will respond to this decree remains to be seen, but there are already signs of discord and protest.
 
The Second Decree
The second decree, that of June 26, is the most drastic of all. To make it more palatable, it was issued at the initiative of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the USSR. A very important part of the decree is that which institutes a general wage cut amongst all workers of more than 15 percent. This is done not by directly cutting the amount of rubles which one Russian worker gets, but by lengthening the working day. Work is now organized on the basis of a seven day week, instead of a six day week. Hours of work per working day are lengthened from seven to eight hours, in all cases where the working day was formerly seven hours. This covers the overwhelming majority of workers. Those previously working six hours must now work seven hours, while employees of institutions and persons reaching the age of 16 who had previously worked six hours must now work eight hours. In all cases, of course, while the hours of work are increased, the wage remains the same.
More important, however, than the wage cut in the decree of June 26 is the remainder of the decree which establishes complete industrial peonage. Workers are now absolutely forbidden to leave their jobs without authorization, or to move from one job to another. Permission for leaving or changing jobs can be granted only by the special authorization of a factory director. If a worker violates this provision, he can be sentenced by the People’s Court to a prison term of from two to four months. If the violation is called an illegal absence, the previous penalty for illegal absence – compulsory dismissal from the job – is supplanted by the new penalty: compulsory labor at the place of employment for a term of six months at a 25 percent wage reduction. And, typical of all Soviet decrees, factory directors who do not properly enforce these provisions will themselves be hold responsible.
The lengthening of the work day is justified by references to the dangerous international situation and the threat of war. But it is nowhere indicated that this lengthening of the work day is to be temporary. The binding of workers to the factory, coming on top of the previous introduction of the internal passport system, is aimed at reducing the labor turnover in Soviet industry. The average Russian worker changes his job at least once a year. This is merely a reflection of the terrible living conditions obtaining in most Russian towns and factories. In addition, many of those workers guilty of “illegal absence” were Communist Party members absent on meetings of one kind or another. Consequently, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party held in July, 1940, in order to enforce the decree of June 28 amongst Communist Party workers, decreed that there were to be no meetings or conferences of any kind during the working hours of the factory! Nothing, absolutely nothing, is to, interfere with the worker’s performance on his job.
 
The Third Decree
The third decree, that of July 10, has to do with output of poor quality and bad performance on the job. Such cases are to be considered wreckage, and therefore a crime against the State. Factory directors and engineers will be held responsible and are subject to prison sentences of from five to eight years in case established standards are not lived up to in, any respect whatsoever.
Closely related to these decrees are two others, one of which establishes the penalty for “petty theft” (regardless of the amount) or “acts of hooliganism” at one year in jail; the other specifically applies the industrial peonage decrees to the factory directors, and other managerial officials. No one employed in a factory in any capacity is now permitted to leave that factory, without the consent of Stalin, or one of his hirelings. Life in Stalin’s “paradise” will be something like the following for the average person: He attends school until the age of 14 (our equivalent of free secondary education, and free higher education has been abolished by a more recent decree); from the age of 14 to 18 he will be drafted for compulsory vocational training in mechanical lines which will serve the war machine; at the age of 18 he enters upon five years compulsory military training; at the age of 23, unless he enters permanent service in the armed forces, he will be assigned to work in any occupation in any location that pleases the dictate of the Kremlin. All this, of course, is in direct violation of Stalin’s own constitution of 1936.
When assigned to some factory or establishment, regardless of his own inclination or family ties, the Soviet slave is now bound to the establishment for the rest of his working days. If, of course, the masters in the Kremlin wish to change his place of servitude, they may do so without consulting the worker himself. The result is, therefore, that the Russian worker today does not even have the same rights that the Russian serf had. The serf, at least, while treated as a thing, whose function was simply to produce enough for his lord and master to live on, was bound to the soil and could not be moved about at the whim of his master.
The immediate reason for these decrees of industrial peonage is to be found in the visible breakdown of the Russian system of economic planning. The only way that Stalin knows to increase production is to command slave labor to produce or else. Whether these decrees will increase production or not, remains to be seen. If they do not, it will only hasten the day when Hitler decides to take over the direction of Soviet economy himself. If they do bring results, which is most unlikely, they can only serve to increase the thickness of the chains which bind the Russian worker in servitude today. In my next article in this series, I shall try to show the extent of the breakdown in Soviet economic planning and the reasons for this breakdown, for it must never be forgotten that the fundamental reasons for Stalin’s present policy are to be found in the internal weaknesses of Stalin’s regime.
 



Ever since the last war, the intelligent capitalists of this country have been analyzing the experiences of World War I in preparation for the inevitable outbreak of World War II. These analyses involve not only military preparation, but also economic preparation. The fruits of the economic investigations are to be found in a little book, called Wartime Control of Prices (written by Charles O. Hardy and published by the Brookings Institution, Washington, B.C. in September 1940 – price $1.00). Mr. Hardy proposes a very simple program – rigid control of prices. This includes all prices, not only the prices of the commodities which we have to buy and which the Government must buy in order to carry out the military program, but wages and rents as well. The only exception to this program is profits. In order to concentrate all energies on the war effort, all restrictions on the efficient (cheap) mobilization of both human and natural resources must be abandoned – at least, for the duration of the “emergency” period.
 
Reforms Go First
That this is the real program of the American capitalists can be readily seen from a few comparisons of what is recommended by Mr. Hardy with what is actually going on now. Mr. Hardy proposes that the “Walsh-Healey Act be suspended for the duration of the war emergency.” The Navy Department has recently made this proposal, because it has made more difficult the letting of contracts by the Navy. In other words, one of the key reforms of the New Deal – that companies serving the Government should maintain “adequate” standards of pay and working conditions – is to be thrown into the waste paper basket because capital is insisting that the sky is the limit for profits. What a commentary on this Second World War for Democracy! Mr. Hardy, in effect, is for outlawing strikes in “national defense” industries. This has not as yet been enacted into law, but what a campaign the capitalists and their agents are putting on to accomplish this. Only the conscious and determined opposition of organized labor can prevent this undermining of one of the fundamental and hard-won democratic rights of labor. Similarly, for the 40 hour week, time and a half for overtime, WPA, relief and virtually everything else that can possibly be considered progressive. If the workers permit the capitalists to carry out their program, all of these will be abolished.
The experiences of World War II to date shows that in many ways the civilian population (if one can speak of a civilian population as separate and distinct from the armed forces) plays a key role in the maintenance of national morale. When prices rise substantially and the real income of the population declines, the capitalist understands that it is more difficult to convince the population at large of the justness of the war. Fragmentary reports that have reached us so far indicate that, on the average, prices’ have risen 50% and the standard of living has declined by at least one-third in all belligerent countries.
To be sure, the cost of the war must be borne by the people in the form of declining standards of living, for from an economic point of view, war is sheer and unadulterated waste. The problem, however, is to sugar-coat the declining standard of living so that it appears not to be as great as it is. This is made especially necessary by the experiences (still within the living memory of many adult citizens) that every belligerent country experienced during and after the last war with inflation, catastrophic declines in living standards – a few making millions in sharp contrast to the remainder of the population – and the general economic breakdown which is the inevitable aftermath of war.
To all these considerations, there is added another, which makes the current problem of price control even more fundamental than at any in the history of capitalism. Capitalism has clearly entered upon its period of decline. Discussion of what the new order of things will be after this war is unavoidable. The ruling class, as a whole, is keenly aware of the impact of the war upon their established order of society. They wish to make as certain as they can that any controls introduced – in fact, any governmental measures of any type whatsoever – shall not alter the basic foundations of capitalism.
 
A Blueprint for War
During the First World War, the cost of living rose some 60% in the United States. Certain commodity prices, such as sugar, butter and meats, rose between 100% and 200%, and in some of these cases rationing was required. In all the warring countries today, on top of the substantial price rises and inferior quality of many commodities, rationing of many essentials is already in effect. The Government is not only interested in this problem from the point of view of its effect on the standards of living and, therefore, on civilian morale, but in the most direct way it is concerned with the cost of the war effort.
The more prices rise, the greater is the cost of the war to the Government. The greater the cost of the war, the greater the necessity for increasing taxation of all sorts. Increased taxation is always a difficult measure for any popularly elected government to resort to, because it is sure to raise a storm of protest from one or more sections of the population. Hence in a very practical and direct way, the government is interested in such a study as Mr. Hardy has made from the point, of view of cutting down the cost of war to it.
What emerges as outstanding in Mr. Hardy’s discussion is that although he is speaking about controlling prices during the present period – that is, one of national “defense,” when formally speaking, the country is not at war – he himself makes the admission that the problems which confront the organization of the “defense” effort are substantially the same as they would be if the United States were actually engaged in war. So what we have is a primer or a blueprint of what is in store for us during the next five years – which is the legal limitation at present of the “emergency” period. The second outstanding fact that Mr. Hardy, and we may be sure the members of the government as well, realizes is that: “The problem of economic organization in time of war differs from that in time of peace in that it is essential to concentrate productive energies on an abnormal emergency objective – that of winning the war.” All energies must be devoted to this end. Everything else is secondary, including to be sure, the preservation of those democratic rights, for which, presumably, the war is to be fought.
 
Sees Tight Control
Since controls were required during the last war, Mr. Hardy correctly assumes that even more extensive controls will be required this time. The only question in his mind is the character of these controls and the efficacy of some of these controls as compared to others. The conclusion implicit in the book is that far more extensive controls will be required this time than last. While the author does not say so directly, in view of the criticisms he makes of the methods used during the last war, the implication is clear that such far reaching controls will be required this time that the difference between the economic setup in the United States at war and that which prevails in totalitarian countries will be very slight indeed.
Another outstanding feature of the study is that no matter what proposal is discussed or proposed, there is always a conscious emphasis on the necessity for maintaining profits. Even in discussing the price-ceiling plan of Mr. Bernard Baruch, who was Chairman of the War Industries Board during the World War and also a member of the Price-Fixing Committee, the necessity for establishing such prices which will yield profits even to the high-cost producer is made quite clear. This, in spite of the title of the book (privately printed) in which Mr. Baruch presents his views – Taking the Profits Out of War. For example, in summarizing the lessons of the last war, Mr. Hardy states: “There was undue reliance on the excess profits tax to correct unnecessarily high prices paid by the government.”
From a technical point of view one of the few shortcomings of the book is that it omits any real discussion uf profits and their control during wartime. But what else can be the meaning of the passage quoted than a defense of the necessity of industry making profits in order to organize a war effort “most efficiently?” And, of course, the experiences of the last war and the present war to date show very clearly that war is a profitable undertaking for the capitalist class, or at least for the most powerful sections of it, even if it means untold misery and privation for the masses of the population.
 
Labor Takes Rap
That the plans discussed in this book are thoroughly reactionary from the point of view of labor and the mass of peoples is not surprising. But what is surprising is that the entire reactionary program of the war department should here be set down in black on white for all those with eyes to see. First of all, the author advocates “compulsory labor at wages which the worker is not free to reject” for those directly employed by the government. It should be obvious that the number of people
directly employed by the government represents a far larger proportion of the total population this lime than in the case of the last war. Since the conception of the war effort which Mr. Hardy has, in common with the rest of the capitalists, is that all that matters is winning the war – not how the war is won and what the effects of the various methods will be, he quite logically proposes, for example, the suspension of the Walsh-Healey Act If one has any doubt of the intentions of big business, just read very carefully the following excerpts from Mr, Hardy, which clearly speaks for them:
“To take the position that labor should make no contribution toward carrying the economic burden of the war would be indefensible ... If labor is to make any economic contribution to the cost of the war. the cost of living must rise more than the wage rates.”
Again, “Unemployment benefits should sot be permitted to act as drag on re-employment.” Hence out of the window with WPA, relief – and perhaps even with unemployment insurance.
Since Mr. Hardy, (erroneously) attributes the 1937 collapse to increases in wages, it is only natural that he is against any wage increases during the war period, except in a few exceptional cases. The Government would be given by Mr. Hardy the authority to review and decide all collective bargaining agreements now in effect. “All restrictions on hours of labor, except those that serve a bona fide purpose of protecting workers’ health, must he abrogated.” Compulsory payments of time and a half for overtime must be abolished. By not-too-well-concealed implications, Mr. Hardy is also for the outlawing of strikes. Shades of Hitler! This is the real program of the capitalist class, for which the workers of America will be told to lay down their lives.
This investigation of the experiences of American imperialism in controlling prices during the First World War, with recommendations for price control during the Second World War, was undertaken at the request of the United States War Department. Therein lies the tremendous significance of the book. It represents the policies which the capitalists are considering and proposing in relation to the economic control of the nation. It goes without saying that labor cannot look to its own defense unless it knows and understands the plans of the Government. The book should really be compulsory reading for every trade unionist – indeed for everyone who does not live off the fruits of other people’s labor.
 






The recent Russian-German trade agreement once again focuses attention on what has been happening within the Soviet Union. The following is the first of a series of articles by Frank Demby on developments within the USSR since the outbreak of World War II, with special emphasis on the economic situation. – Ed.



*
Many, indeed, were the speculations concerning the trip of Soviet Premier-Foreign Commissar Vyascheslaff M. Molotoff to Berlin last November and his conversations with Hitler and other high Nazi dignitaries.’The first visible result has been the signing of an “enlarged economic agreement” in Moscow on Jan. 10, 1941, by Molotoff tor the USSR and Ambassador Schulenburg for Germany. This treaty includes a settlement of the Russian-German boundary and an agreement on property claims in the former Baltic states. The treaty is subject to ratification in Berlin in the shortest possible time.
“The new agreement is based on the Soviet-German economic agreement of Feb. 11, 1940, and constitutes a further step in execution of the economic program outlined by the two governments in 1939. The agreement regulates the trade turnover between the USSR and Germany until Aug. 1, 1942. It provides for an amount of mutual deliveries considerably exceeding the level of the first year of operation of the agreement.
“The USSR delivers to Germany industrial raw materials, oil products and foodstuffs, especially cereals; Germany delivers to the USSR industrial equipment.
“The negotiations passed in a spirit of mutual understanding and confidence conforming to the friendly relations existing between the USSR and Germany. All economic problems, including those that arose in connection with the incorporation of new territories into the USSR, were solved in conformity with the interests of both countries.” (Quoted from the text of the agreement, released by Tass. and published in the N.Y. Times of Jan. 11, 1941 – my emphasis – FD)
 
Closer Relations
In an era where economic problems are steadily multiplying, it is very refreshing to see that two countries have solved “all economic problems.” The new Soviet-German accords, official bombast and vagueness aside, do, however, indicate steadily closer economic relations between Russia and Germany. How much actual material was delivered by the Soviet Union to Germany during the ppst year is impossible to determine. But there are some indications given of the size of the trade expected during the coming year.
“The Soviet Union is said to have agreed to furnish Germany with 2.500,000 tons of grain and fodder, barley and 1,500,000 tons of oil in exchange for German finished goods.” (Percival Knauth. from Berlin, in N.Y. Times of’ Jan. 11)
These figures, passed through the Berlin censor, may merely reflect German expectations. On the other hand, there is just as good a reason for believing that they give a good indication of the size of German-Russian trade relations. If the entire 2,500,000 tons of grain are considered as wheat, this would be the equivalent of about 92,000,000 American bushels. This is no insignificant sum, nor is the figure given for oil one to be ignored in estimating Russia’s current role as a supplier of the German War Machine. According to German sources, the amounts involved will “run into billions of marks.”
 
Acts as Broker
A further indication of Russia’s role may be seen from the fact that Russia has recently emerged as a fairly large buyer in the American market, and is reported as trying to negotiate trade treaties in many other countries, notably China, Argentina and other South American countries. During 1940, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Russia bought approximately $100,000,000 worth of goods here – about double the 1939 figure. This very substantial rise in American exports to Russia has virtually all occurred since the outbreak of the war, and has given rise to the suspicion that most of these imports are being shipped through Siberia to Germany, or are being used to release equivalent amounts of Russian commodities for export to Germany.
This suspicion is reinforced when one considers the particular materials that Russia is importing from the U.S. Russian foreign trade policy, ever since the institution of the first five-year plan in 1928 has been aimed at importing machinery, parts, machine tools and similar technical equipment – for the purpose of furthering the industrialization of Russia. It is very rare that raw materials are imported. On the contrary, Russia has paid for her technical imports with gold and raw materials. Hence, the imports of 139,591 bales of cotton (since Aug. 1, 1940), of 108,955.000 pounds of copper (in 1940), of more than 1,000,000 barrels of oil (which figure is steadily increasing) – all point to the conclusion that Stalin, willingly or unwillingly, has become an important part of the German war machine.
According to C. Brooks Peters, from Berlin, in the N.Y. Times of Jan. 13, “The Russians have agreed to facilitate the transit of German products to the Far East, as well as lighten the tasks of commerce between Iran and Afghanistan and the Reich.” Also, “The treaty is said to stipulate that Russia will deliver to the Reich goods whose origin is in a third country.” This undoubtedly is part of the “fresh proof,” of which Pravda speaks, “of the durability of good-neighborly relations between the two greatest European states.” Stalin has not only agreed to act as a supplier of vital materials for the German war machine, but, in addition, he is undertaking the role of German broker!
 
Depends on Hitler
The Germans claim “the reciprocal agreement was reached in favor of the Reich.” This claim is reinforced by the German admission that their deliveries of industrial equipment during the life of the previous treaty were behind schedule. And yet, Stalin contracts for “deliveries considerably above the level of the first year.” Why? The answer lies in two factors that are becoming increasingly important in understand the evolution of the Soviet Russian economy.
The first factor is one of geography. Or, as Gedye, writing from Turkey in the N.Y. Times of Jan. 12 puts it: “Thus the old fear of Germany’s mechanized forces still holds Soviet Russia in check – and this fear has, it is known, led her to speed up deliveries recently, deliveries that the Nazis need.” (My emphasis – FD) The other factor may prove even more important in trying to estimate the direction in which Soviet economy is now moving.
Russia’s fundamental economic weaknesses, the virtual breakdown of her system of economic planning, the introduction of peonage labor decrees, visible faults in the structure of collective farming, all force Stalin to depend more and more on German industry and German technicians. German experts “are now acquainted with the special problems involved,” and thus may be expected to play a steadily more important role in the Russian economy. Even if Stalin were separated by vast oceans from Hitler’s Germany, the fact remains that the economic weaknesses of Soviet Russia force him to depend more and more on Hitler. These economic weaknesses, and the direction in which they are leading, will be analyzed in subsequent articles of this series.
 



The recent 18th conference of Stalin’s “Communist” Party indicates that the Stalinist regime is near the end of its rope. Behind the more dramatic expulsions of Litvinoff, as a member, and Madame Molotoff, as an alternate, from Stalin’s Central Committee lurks the lurid self-confessed picture of bureaucratic bankruptcy. All the manipulations of statistics, which long ago became a “class” science in Stalinland – i.e., a propaganda device – cannot hide the fact that the regime totters on the brink of the grave.
“The more honest we are in disclosing our shortcomings, the sooner shall we be able to get rid of them. Stalin daily teaches us this,” said the nonentity, Malenkoff, who delivered the main report, while “the great leader of the peoples, Stalin,” sat on the platform calmly watching his lackeys trying to explain away the awful mess into which his gangster regime has dragged the entire national economy. Hypocrisy knows no limits so far as these cynical grave-diggers of the revolution are concerned. “The regime of dirt, top-heavy bureaucracy, laziness, armchair administration, and chatter-boxes” has resulted, according to Malenkoff, in decreased output, increasing costs and threatened purges in such industries as building materials and lumber, oil, paper, railroad and water transport, aircraft, chemical, munitions, electrical, maritime and fishing. This picture of more or less complete chaos is then dressed up by Voznesensky, chairman of the State Planning Commission, as one of “new Socialist upsurge and further progress.”
 
From Plan to Plan
“On November, 1, 1940,” reports Pravda (as quoted in the Daily Worker of Feb. 18), “in eight industrial people’s commissariats, 33,000 machine tools stand idle. At 7,629 enterprises, 170,000 electric motors were not mounted. The cement industry last year worked only at 64 per cent of its capacity.” This presumably is an illustration of what Voznesensky means when he says (Sunday Worker, Feb. 23): “However, by no means all enterprises and people’s commissariats have utilized the possibilities for the growth of production created by the edict of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, dated June 26, 1940.” (This refers to the industrial peonage laws which I described in Labor Action of Feb. 3.)
In spite of the fact that Voznesensky’s report is carefully enveloped in percentages and figures expressed in rubles, and in spite of the omission of certain vital figures, it is possible, on the basis of what is given and what is known about the situation of Soviet economy at the end of the Second Five Year Plan in 1937, to obtain a fairly reliable picture of the extent of the breakdown of Soviet economic planning during the last three years – years of almost constant and perpetual purges, the Soviet-Finnish war and the Hitler-Stalin pact, which has resulted in Soviet economy becoming more and more dependent on German economy The Second Five Year Plan was begun on Jan. 1, 1933, with the fond expectation of “overtaking and outstripping the capitalistic countries” by the end of it, in 1937. One must rub one’s eyes with amazement at the proposal of a Fifteen Year Plan, which emanated from the recent conference, and has for its purpose “outstripping the leading capitalist states in the per capita production of pig iron, steel, fuel, electric power, machinery and other means of production and articles of consumption.” The fact that per capita production in the Soviet Union declined during the last three years and that it admittedly lags way behind production in the advanced capitalist countries (three to four times, according to Voznesensky, and much more in reality) may not disturb the equanimity of Stalin and his hierarchy. But surely the Russian workers and peasants do not feel overjoyed at the prospect of facing 15 more years of Stalin’s rule of promises mixed with forced slavery.
The Third Five Year Plan (1938–1942) was not even mentioned during the year 1938. Except for the fact that it was supposed to be approved by the Council of People’s Commissars by July 1, 1937, one would never know that a Third Five Year Plan was even contemplated. In January 1939, however, it was admitted that “difficulties of reorganization” had delayed the publication of the Third Five Year Plan, but it was nevertheless operating “satisfactorily.” The plan was formally approved at the 17th Congress of the Communist Party in March, 1939. Aside from an oblique reference by Molotoff to the fact that the Third Five Year Plan called for a 100 per cent increase in heavy industry and producers’ goods during the lifetime of the Plan, one could have legitimately questioned the existence of a Third Five Year Plan, even on paper.
After years of constant sacrifice, the promise that Stalin made to the Russian masses that a temporary period of sacrifice would result in the creation of a land of plenty is completely belied by the official figures on national income given by the same Voznesensky. The national income of the USSR was 125,500,000,000 rubles in 1940, or a per capita annual income of about 650 rubles. The national income in 1937, at the end of the Second Five Year Plan, is now officially announced as 96 billion rubles, or a per capita annual income of about 600 rubles. The increase of 29,500,000,000 rubles is thus almost entirely negated by the increase in population, which is a product of Stalin’s expansionist policy and his reactionary social laws, such as virtually making abortions impossible and using the fascist technique of bonuses for large families. But this fails to take into account the purchasing power of the ruble and what has happened to the purchasing power of the ruble during the last three years. The most conservative estimates available indicate that the ruble’s purchasing power has declined by at least half since 1937. This indicates that the average standard of living of the Russian people has declined by at least 46 per cent during the last three years. And since the inequality of income in Russia is notorious, this means that the overwhelming majority of workers and peasants suffered a much greater decline in their standard of living. It is highly probable, therefore, that the standard of living of the Russian workers and peasants today, more than 23 years after the Bolshevik Revolution, is decidedly below that which existed under the Czar and can only be compared with that of the Chinese coolie.
This decline in the standard of living is in sharp contrast to the growth of the productive forces.
 
Production Lags
When Voznesensky reports that Soviet production is 534 per cent of 1929 production and goes on to make such a terrific hullaballoo about this tremendous increase as compared with the very small increase in production in the United States between 1929 and 1940, it is first necessary to make a few important corrections and then to give the figures the proper interpretation.
In the first place, on the basis of rough estimates which I made for 1929 production in the USSR, production in 1940 was 283 per cent of 1929 – and not 534 per cent In the second place, the decisive portion of this very considerable increase took place during the first and second Five Year Plans – not during the first three years of the third Five Year Plan. The increase during the last three years is only about 15 per cent.
In the third place, production during the first three years of the third Five Year Plan was supposed to have increased by about 60 per cent. It only increased 15 per cent. In other words, the plan, if it exists, has only been fulfilled about 25 per cent so far, and this does not take into account the terrific disproportions in Soviet economy caused by the bureaucratic commands entering into the economy as a result of underfulfillment of certain plans and the drive to overfulfill others.
Fourthly, and most important of all, according to official Stalinist estimates, production at the end of the second Five Year Plan (1937) was estimated to have increased anywhere between 8 and 12 times from the productive levels of 1929. So that, even if we accept as entirely accurate the Stalinist figure of 1940 production as being a little more than five times the 1929 production, the regime stands convicted of a considerable decrease in production.
The crisis in the Soviet economy has reached such proportions that it cannot be concealed. That is the real meaning of Stalin’s 18th Party Congress. And this was only to be expected, for genuine economic planning requires thoroughgoing democratic control of the planned economy by the working population. This, of course, is utterly excluded as long as the totalitarian bureaucracy exists. Correcting mistakes in the plans and flaws in the economy becomes impossible when life is organized on the basis of: Produce according to the dictates of the Kremlin or be shot. The idle boast that the USSR is now independent of capitalist economy is given the lie by the official figures for Soviet production and by the steady efforts made to import machines and machine tools from Germany and the United States. Stalin can only hope to offset the economic crisis, expressed in declining standards of living, declining productivity of labor and the slowing down of the growth of production almost to a standstill, and thus preserve his tottering regime, by engaging in new foreign adventures.
 



As soon as the ink was dry on the President’s message to Congress last week asking for seven billion dollars to implement the “all-out aid to England” program, the proposals as to how this money should be raised came thick and fast. Rumor has it that they boil down to two main propositions Either or both is being given serious attention by those “patriots” who measure the extent of their patriotism by the degree to which they can increase their bank accounts. One is a 5 per cent payroll tax to be levied each week on all those earning $25 a week or more. This tax would be deducted at the source. That, is, the employer will deduct it from your paycheck and you will get your regular weekly pittance minus; the 5 per cent. In the course of a year, it is estimated that such a tax can raise several billion dollars. The other proposal is for a national sales tax to be placed on all articles that enter into commerce. A two or three per cent sales tax on everything you buy could also raise several billion dollars.
 
Very Noticeable Inconveniences
If either or both of these measures is adopted the government’s credit will be maintained in a sound position, industry can go ahead and “pay-triotically” produce the munitions required to save democracy without worrying about its incentive to produce being destroyed, for there will no longer be any necessity to talk about higher taxes on corporations and excess profits taxes and such annoying things. Isn’t this a small sacrifice to maintain our way of life? Besides, you won’t even notice it. This argument of the reactionaries was given sharp emphasis by the President in his “Aid to Democracies” speech on March 15, when he said, in speaking about everybody sacrificing: “Yes, you will feel the impact of this gigantic effort in your daily lives. You will feel it in a way that will cause lo you many inconveniences.”
And these “inconveniences” will be very, very noticeable: A worker making $25 a week would have $1. deducted from his payroll every week, if the payroll tax goes through. If the national sales tax should also be passed, that will place an additional burden on the worker, who is already having a hard enough struggle to feed, clothe and shelter his wife and children. Assuming that $20 out of a worker’s $25 weekly income spent on goods and services that would be subject to sales tax, that would mean (on the basis of a 2 per cent sales tax) an additional 40 cents a week cut in wages. $1.65 a week, or more, in new taxes may not sound very much, but for a worker getting only $25 a week, this is tremendous sum. someone getting $125 a week or a corporation executive receiving the measly stipend of $2,500 a week can very easily afford to pay five times, or 100 times, what the worker making $25 a week can afford to pay. Both a payroll tax and a sales tax are vicious, reactionary types of taxes. The burden falls most heavily on those who can least afford to pay them. this is a direct violation or the accepted principle of taxation, that taxes should be based on ability to pay.
Moreover, this does not take into account at all the fact that prices are rising and promise to rise much more rapidly in the future. Wholesale commodity prices arc already more than 29 per cent higher than they were at the outbreak of World War II on Sept. 1, 1939. Retail prices are beginning to catch up to wholesale prices. Meat prices have risen, in some cases, more than 25 per cent in the same period. The cost of living on the average throughout the country has gone up more than 3 per cent and will now start to rise in all earnestness. To which must be added the fact that with the establishment of priorities in aluminum and other metals, we will just begin to feel the impact of the war economy in coming months in the form of shortages of many things that the consumer needs.
Some will grant that these new taxes are very unfair, but, they want to know, how else can we pay for the cost of the war program? The answer is simple. The big corporations in 1940 made the highest profits they have made since 1929, even after making deductions for higher taxes. Why not, Mr. President, take these billions of dollars of profits and use them to pay for the cost of your and their “Aid to England” program? And if the 60 families that run this country and control the lion’s share of the wealth won’t turn out munitions to preserve “democracy” unless, they can make their 8, 10 and more per cent profit, WHY NOT, MR. PRESIDENT, HAVE THE GOVERNMENT TAKE OVER THEIR FACTORIES AND PLACE THEM UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WORKERS?
You won’t do this, Mr. Roosevelt for the simple reason that your desire to defeat Hitler is, and must be, subordinated to your desire to maintain the profit system. If you dared to take any steps against profits, your real bosses – not the American people, but Wall Street and the 60 families – wouldn’t like it. They might even get rid of you as no longer useful to them. We say that you can’t preserve democracy and profits, Mr. President. One or the other will have to go.
And by the way, did you know that while you were speaking about all of us sacrificing to help the cause of democracy (read: American imperialism), your Congress is considering ways and means of lightening the burden of the excess profits tax? Yes, this same excess profits tax that was such a swindle last October that you couldn’t count on it to raise more than a little chicken feed in a year when corporations were making huge profits, is now to be reduced. New exemptions and deductions are to be allowed.
If the meaning of this isn’t clear to you, Mr. Roosevelt, it certainly will be clear to the workers of this country. When you speak of sacrifice, what you mean is that the workers should sacrifice. They should pay for the cost of your war; they should stop striking to improve their conditions so that nothing will interfere with your program of making American imperialism supreme throughout the world. This is pure hypocrisy and we are confident that the workers of this country will recognize it for what it is and will act accordingly.
 



The Senate of the United States has outdone the House of Representatives in the race to see which branch of the “people’s” representatives can place the heavier tax burden on the masses. It’s all in a good cause – financing the “war for democracy”’ – so don’t mind if your tax bill is increased from three to seven times next year.
The Senate voted to lower exemptions on the income tax from $800 to $750 for single persons and from $2,000 a year to $1,500 a year for married persons. This means that about 6,000,000 more persons – 23,000,000 in all – will have to file an income tax in 1942 if this bill becomes law. It also means higher rates for those earning from $2,000 to $10,000. Altogether, over $300,000,000 will be raised by this device.
To show their seriousness in making the poor pay for the bosses’ war, the Senate lowered the excess profits tax almost $70,000,000. It then more than made up for this by raising the ante on excise and miscellaneous taxes some $85,000,000. This was done chiefly by raising the admission tax for amusements from 10 to 15 per cent, doubling the tax on local telephone bills (10 per cent instead of 5), imposing a 10 per cent tax on electric light bulbs, and a new tax on gas and oil appliances was included. The Senate has topped the House by more than $450,000,000 – of which almost 100 per cent falls on those who work for a living.
Whether this will satisfy the National Association of Manufacturers, who agitated for a national sales tax and a payroll tax, remains to be seen. It will certainly not meet with favor among the workers. A loud roar of protest from the trade unions can still make Congress retreat a few steps!

Meanwhile profits continue to soar for the big companies under the impetus of huge war orders. The following figures show quite clearly to all except the Congress of the United States that taxes on profits and corporations can still be increased SUBSTANTIALLY without denting profits very much (figures are for the first half of each fiscal year):

And this is only a small sample of what goes on every day. The patriotism of the rich thrives on this sort of diet. But what about the rest of us?

The first measures so far taken to prevent inflation remain a farce. Where they amount to anything, they are, as we predicted, further blows at the standard of living of the masses. The 7 p.m. curfew for the purpose of rationing gasoline has not only not reduced the consumption of gas, but available estimates show on increase in the sales of gas stations during the past few weeks.
Meanwhile, Henderson’s order setting a price ceiling of 18.9 cents a gallon in the New York area has been honored more in the breach than by observance. This has brought a threat from “Little Flower” LaGuardia to have the mayors of various cities revoke the licenses of those dealers who are raising their prices. The only thing that will prevent a first-rate tempest from blowing up over this first example of what a war economy means is the sudden “discovery” that there are thousands of railroad oil tankers lying idle. The railroads and oil companies, were just having a private feud. The let-the-public-be-damned attitude of big business is due for a small curb in this instance.

On September 1, the new curbs on installment buying – aimed at restricting the purchases of durable consumers’ goods by the low income groups – went into effect. The Federal Reserve Board limited the maximum time for payments to 18 months and increased the down payments substantially in many cases. Sellers of these items report a brisk business; in some cases better than ever. Since the overwhelming majority of the $10,000,000,000 installment business is carried on among the workers and lower middle class, a serious restriction of this form of credit would mean a sharp decline in the standard of living of the masses. At present, the curbs on credit remain a joke – but watch out for the future!

On the organization front the President shuffled his “defense” agencies a bit. A super seven-man board, formally known as the Supply Priorities and Allocations Board, has been set up, charged with the responsibility of supervising the OPM and the other war bureaus. The SPAB is headed by Vice-President Wallace. The other members are: Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, William S. Knudsen and Sidney Hillman of the OPM, Price Administrator Henderson (who relinquishes his control of civilian supply) and Dollar-a-Year-Man Donald Nelson, who will be the executive director. Thus does Roosevelt hope to remove the conflicts that have been going on in Washington and satisfy the critics of the production program. That this will not do the trick was indicated by the blast from Barney Baruch, chairman of the War Industries Board in World War I, who continues to insist on the necessity for a one-man head.
Meanwhile, another Wall Street speculator crashed the Washington dollar-a-year racket with the appointment of Floyd B. Odlum as director of the new Division of Contract Distribution. This replaces the Defense Contract Service and is supposed to see to it that small business gets sub-contracts on the huge war orders that the big corporations are getting and can’t fill. Fat chance! Small business is doomed and the war economy will hasten the process. After all, why should organizations controlled by big business order themselves to split their profits with a lot of little competitors? Monopoly capitalism doesn’t work that way. Not only can’t it create a decent peace economy; it can’t even establish an efficient war economy!

Two developments along Wall Street are worth noting. We are very happy to report that Wendell L. Willkie, the man who made the supreme sacrifice of resigning from the presidency of Commonwealth & Southern to crusade against the dictatorial aims of the New Deal third term, is not doing so badly for himself. After becoming senior partner in the lucrative law firm of Willkie, Owen, Otis & Bailey, this junior partner of the unincorporated firm of Roosevelt & Willkie was elected a director of the Federal Insurance Co. on June 4. Now he is being proposed for a second directorship – this time in the very important firm controlled by the Lehman brothers, known as the Lehman Corp. We are confident that the October 15 meeting of the stockholders of the Lehman Corp. will elect Mr. Willkie a director. Just another example of how it pays to be a public-spirited citizen, provided, of course, you know the right people! Who says this isn’t the land of opportunity?
The other interesting development in Wall Street is further evidence of the tremendous opportunities that await the eager and patient youngster of today. The American Telephone & Telegraph Co., a Morgan subsidiary, which has conducted all its financing for the past 30 years through the House of Morgan, has announced that its forthcoming issue of $94,500,000 worth of debentures is to be subject to competitive bidding. Here’s a chance for you to make a million dollars in commission. All you have to do is to submit the lowest bid for handling these bonds. The lowest bidder must get the issue. Then all you have to do is to sell them. The bonds are absolutely gilt-edged. There should be no trouble at all. So far, however, there are only two syndicates in the field; one, a group of 28 powerful investment bankers, headed by Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. (Mr. Morgan’s son-in-law is head man in this outfit); the other, one of the largest syndicates every assembled, comprising about 175 investment houses, headed by Halsey, Stuart & Co., Inc., and the Mellon Securities Corp. We are about $94,499,999 short of the required amount, else we would submit a bid. Maybe our readers can help us out.
Kidding aside, though, this is important because it shows that all attempts to maintain competition must remain solely between the big capitalists. And it can’t be otherwise, considering the kind of economic system we live under. One more proof of the necessity for socialism!
 



AFTER MORE THAN two years of the Second World War, and after more than one year of the “Defense” Program, the single outstanding fact which emerges in any study of the economic situation in the United States is that America has entered upon a period of war economy. Already, approximately 25 per cent of the national income is being spent for purposes of armament. This amount will steadily increase until, before long, the major proportion of American resources, both human and material, will be devoted to the production of means of destruction. The American public is still almost blissfully unaware of what this will mean in terms of the daily routine of normal life. Rising prices, increased taxes, shortages of consumers goods, fast-increasing government controls – all, however, point to the inescapable fact that the “honeymoon” period is over. From now on, as the war economy develops further, the mass of the people will become well aware of what a war economy means. The standard of living will go down. The routine of normal life will be seriously interrupted due to the increasing dislocations produced by the insatiable appetite of the war machine. The atmosphere of crisis will become chronic, for war is but an expression of far-reaching social crisis.
The developing war economy brings in its train a series of important questions – political, social and economic in nature. I am particularly concerned, in this article, with some of the economic questions raised by the entrance of the United States into a period of war economy. Two basic questions immediately arise: Who pays for the war economy and how do they pay? Who profits from the war economy and how do they profit? These questions, in turn, give rise to a third basic summary question: What will be the effect of the war economy, in its short-term and long-run aspects, on the future development of American economy?
Early this year, in one of his fireside chats, the President warned the people that they would have to expect sacrifices. While the full implications of these sacrifices remain to be unfolded, the broad outlines, as well as some of the details, are already quite clear. The 1940 and 1941 revenue bills, for example, unmistakably reveal the intention of the government to make the working masses bear the brunt of the burden of financing the imperialist war effort of the United States.
 
The Tax Bill
At this writing, the final form of the 1941 revenue bill has not yet been established. The bill is “in conference,” as a result of several very important changes made by the Senate in the House version. However, it appears that the more drastic Senate version will more nearly approximate the final form of the Bill than that of the House. This will mean a sharp increase in the income tax on the lower income brackets, for the Senate has lowered the exemption for married persons from $2,000 (until 1940 it was $2,500) to $1,500, and for single individuals from $800 (until 1940 it was $1,000) to $750. By this measure 5,000,000 persons who never previously filed a federal income tax will now have to do so. Due to exemptions, it is expected that only about half this number will actually have to pay an income tax in 1942. Altogether, more than 20,000,000 people will now pay an income tax. This does not appear to be very drastic when it is recalled that about 60,000,000 people in the United States receive some form of income. But it must be remembered that the income tax was originally hailed as a progressive form of taxation because it was presumably based on ability to pay.
An income tax which broadens the base as the current bill proposes, begins to violate the “principle” of ability to pay. It definitely imposes severe hardships on those who can least afford to pay. Consider, for example, the case of an unmarried worker making $20 a week ($1,000 a year) – and there are many in this category. Before 1940 he did not pay any income tax. Under the 1940 act, he paid an income tax of $4.00. Under the Senate proposal for the 1941 act, this worker, who has great difficulty maintaining a bare subsistence level, will have to pay an income tax of $21 – more than one week’s pay and an increase of 425 per cent in his income tax. A married worker with no dependents earning $2,000 a year previously paid no income tax. Now he will have to pay an income tax of $42. Remember that this is only the income tax. The TNEC has estimated that approximately 25 per cent of the income of those in the lowest income brackets is already taxed indirectly through various forms of excise taxes.
The indirect tax burden is also be to increased – by more than one billion dollars. This will add tremendously to the tax load borne by the working class and the middle classes. Virtually the same percentage of income received will be paid by the worker and the millionaire, when all forms of taxation are considered!
 
Who Will Really Pay
I do not have the space to analyze the various types of excise taxes proposed. Moreover, this field of taxation is much more subject to change than the income tax before the President affixes his signature. One example will suffice, however, to show the colossal injustice involved. Both the Senate and House have passed a provision calling for a $5 a year “Use” tax on owners of motor vehicles and boats. It is expected that more than $160,000,000 will be raised through this entirely new tax. This is one of the most vicious examples imaginable of a violation of the ability to pay principle in taxation. Firstly, in many cases, automobiles have assumed the proportions of a necessity to their owners. Why include boats (which category presumably covers yachts as well as motorboats) in the same provision with automobiles? Secondly, of the approximately 30,000,000 automobiles subject to this tax, there can be no doubt that the owners of the majority of these cars will find it difficult to pay this tax, whereas a $5.00 tax on the owner of a Packard or Cadillac will hardly put a dent in the owner’s pocketbook. The same is true for virtually every type of excise or miscellaneous tax proposed. The workers and the middle classes – those who work for a living – will finance the imperialist war. They are the ones who will make the real sacrifices under the war economy. In contrast, take the case of a man with an income of $1,000,000 a year, having two dependents. His tax is raised from $717,056.40 to $735,972.40 – an increase of almost $19,000, but it still leaves him more than a quarter of a million dollars on which to struggle along! The excise and miscellaneous taxes hardly figure in the tax burden of the wealthy at all. Nor does this take into account the well known fact that one of the biggest frauds in the present tax structure is the ability of the wealthy to dodge a considerable proportion of their tax burden through the many clever devices that their expensive lawyers have worked out. It was undoubtedly in response to pressure designed to eliminate one of the favorite tax-dodging methods of the rich – making property “gifts” to their spouses – that prompted the House Ways and Means Committee to propose the highly controversial joint returns. This would have compelled all married couples to file a single joint income tax return. The real burden of this device, too, would have fallen, as I pointed out in Labor Action, on the middle income groups and the upper strata of the working class. This is not the way to prevent tax-dodging by the wealthy. Higher estate and gift taxes would be a much more stringent proposal.
 
Profits Insured by Congress
If there still be any doubt that this tax bill is class legislation in favor of the bourgeoisie, a brief glance at the corporation income and excess profits taxes should dispel any lingering illusions. The present corporation income tax rate is 24 per cent of net profits. Slight increases in the surtax rate on corporations have been proposed – 5 per cent on the first $25,000 of net income and 6 per cent thereafter by the House, and 6 and 7 per cent respectively by the Senate. The Senate more than made up for its slight increase in the corporation surtax rate by eliminating the special 10 per cent tax on corporations not earning enough profits to come under the excess profits tax schedule passed by the House.
If taxation is to be based on ability to pay, what is obviously required here is a corporation income tax with progressively higher rates, corresponding to the personal income tax. Why should a Corporation like General Motors, with a net income around $200,000,000 a year, pay the same rate of income tax as a small corporation with a net income of $200,000 or less? And if the argument is made that the large corporation does pay a higher rate of tax because of the excess profits tax provisions, the answer is that fundamentally this is not the case since the excess profits tax remains a pure swindle. The proposed increase of 10 per cent in the excess profits tax schedule (making the tax run from 35 per cent to 60 per cent) is no more than a drop in the bucket, as a glance at current corporate earnings will show. Due to the maintenance of alternate methods of computing the excess profits tax by either the average earnings method or the capital investment method, most of the large corporations have been able to keep their excess profits down to very modest sums. Consequently, they pay a very small excess profits tax. Moreover, the new provision allowing a credit of 125 per cent for all new capital investment will actually lower the excess profits tax in some cases. An excess profits tax of anything less than 100 per cent, and without all the “liberalizing” amendments that have been introduced, cannot be considered a genuine excess profits tax.
The tax burdens outlined above represent only the beginning, severe though they are. As the war economy develops, taxes will continue to increase. Their pattern, however, is established, so long as the capitalist government remains in control of the situation. The motto in Washington is: Soak the poor; Go easy on the rich.
 
What Big Business Demands
The real program of the bourgeoisie is always that presented by the National Association of Manufacturers. In the field of taxation, the NAM has stated its reactionary program in unambiguous terms. Its representative, Livingston W. Houston, chairman of the finance committee of the NAM, testified last month before the Senate Finance Committee in favor of a general sales tax, as well as approving the broadening of the income tax base. The NAM, as well as other organizations representing industry and finance, have already indicated that their basic tax program for next year will not only include a general sales tax (the most reactionary type of tax possible) but also a payroll tax. Volumes of propaganda will be forthcoming during the next year in an attempt to show that the only way to prevent inflation and to preserve the credit of the United States is to tax more heavily the 75 per cent of income earners who get less than $5,000 a year. The surest way to tax this overwhelming majority of the population, in a manner which will make it “almost unnoticeable” to them, is through the sales tax and the payroll tax. So the propaganda will run. It will not mention, however, the really vital point – by levying a sales tax and/or a payroll tax the big bourgeoisie will be utilizing the emergency represented by the developing war economy to accelerate the process of wiping out the middle classes and to saddle the working class with a yoke which will make it impossible for them to breathe.
The answer to the question, Who pays for the war?, gives us already a pretty good picture of what a capitalist war economy looks like. It is hardly one which is designed to appeal to the broad, popular masses, whose support is so essential for the carrying out of the imperialist war program. But, as long as the masses are willing to delude themselves with the utterly false notion that Roosevelt can somehow or other stop fascism, the masses will make these sacrifices, even though with much grumbling.
If the masses can stomach the tax program, it does not at all mean that the remainder of the war economy picture appeals to them. The dislocations caused by the war economy are already becoming quite irritating. At the moment, though, these irritations are mere pin-pricks. What is really getting the goat of the masses, particularly the factory workers, is the absolutely fabulous profits which the big corporations are making – profits which are rolling in despite every attempt to conceal them and at a time when the workers are beginning to feel the pinch of a rising cost of living brought about by steadily rising prices. These huge profits cause an instinctive reaction on the part of workers. They violate their innate sense of fair play. “Why should the big bosses make millions while we sweat and slave for long hours and through an intensive speed-up, while we march and drill until we are utterly worn out in the conscript army, and while our wives are having an increasingly more difficult time making ends meet on account of prices going up practically every day?” These are becoming the daily thoughts of the workers. They are behind almost every strike that takes place. The workers feel that if the actions of the bosses represent good patriotism, they might as well get their “cut” of this temporary prosperity. Who knows how long this war boom will last? These sentiments are not the product of our imagination or wishful thinking. They are repeatedly testified to by eminent representatives of the bourgeoisie. The admittedly low morale of the army and the general apathy of the civilian population to the war are eloquent, if silent, confirmation of the deep-seated existence of this sentiment.
 
The New Prosperity
A war economy without huge profits, however, is simply something that is absolutely inconceivable to the rulers of America. Take these huge profits away and 99.9 per cent of their enthusiasm for war disappears. Reports of corporate earnings that appear daily in the financial sections of the newspapers make it appear that the good old days of 1928 and 1929 are here again. Led by the aircraft industry and munitions manufacturers, and closely followed by chemicals, steel, auto, rubber, petroleum, mining and construction, the boom in profits extends all the way through the consumers’ goods lines, like food, textiles and department stores, to that most bankrupt of all capitalist industries, the railroads. Even the public utilities show substantial increases in profits. Industry as a whole is expected in 1941 at least to equal the fantastic profits of 1929. In any cases, they will undoubtedly be exceeded.
To assume from this that the situation is fundamentally similar to the “Golden Age” of the late 1920s would be to make a fatal error. There are significant differences. This profit boom is occurring in a war economy. This means that the principal market for the products of industry is the government. Without “national defense” orders, which have already passed the huge total of $50,000,000,000, industry, particularly heavy industry, would collapse instantaneously. Along with this increasing dependence of industry on government goes a steady invasion of government by industry. The dollar-a-year men have overrun Washington like a swarm of locusts. Many of the leading and most capable representatives of big business have resigned from their official posts in their respective corporations to assume key posts in the OPM and other Washington bureaus. By sheer coincidence, since most of the dollar-a-year men come from the large and well established corporations, their corporations have received the lion’s share of government contracts. In other words, the market, which becomes increasingly the government, becomes increasingly monopolized by a handful of super-giants.
 
Big Business Gains
The tendency toward concentration of industry and profits which appears as a part of the normal development of capitalism in the epoch of imperialism – a process which clearly set in here in the United States during World War I – is thus reinforced and accentuated as the American war economy develops during World War II. Almost any industry becomes a good example of this tendency. Naturally, the war industries are the best examples. Let us take, for example, the chemical industry.
A review of twenty-two leading corporations indicates a combined net profit of $41,091,152 after income and excess profits taxes in the second quarter of the current year, against $36,396,307 correspondingly in 1940; net profit for the first quarter was $39,458,325, against $40,262,327 in 1940. (New York Times, September 14)
The second quarter of 1941 thus represents the highest profit ever made by the chemical industry in any year. For in the first six months of 1941, twenty-seven companies showed a combined profit of $88,180,705. This compares with $78,997,654 in the first half of 1940 and 172,500,859 in the second half of 1940. Eleven large companies (this excludes the income that duPont receives from General Motors dividends) earned $43,755,445 in the first half of 1941, as against a net profit of $45,075,800 in the first half of 1940. However, when duPont’s dividends from General Motors are included, the figures become $61,255,445 and $62,575,800 respectively. Whether duPont’s General Motors dividends are included or not (and General Motors, of course, is one of the six corporations that has received more than 50 per cent of all “defense” orders), the fact is inescapable that a small portion of the number of firms in the field receives the bulk of the orders and the bulk of the profits. If figures were available for the really big chemical concerns, like duPont, Allied Chemical and Dow Chemical, the concentration of profits would be much more startling.
As a matter of fact, the profits of the giant corporations are even greater than these figures indicate, for I have presented the official figures for net profits, without considering the earnings before provision is made for taxes. The following table (again of eleven leading chemical companies, excluding General Motors’ dividends to duPont) represents a typical picture:



First half

Earnings before taxes

$64,673,449




Federal taxes*


    69,154,174


  19,597,649




* Income and excess profits taxes and contingency reserves against future
tax increases.



Earnings before taxes are thus 74 per cent higher in the first half of 1941 as compared with the first half of 1940. Many industries will show an even higher percentage increase in gross profits. The aircraft industry, for example, is well over 100 per cent. It is true that taxes have increased, but not nearly as much as appears from the figures presented. The joker, of course, is in the phrase, contingency reserves. Just what these are or how much they amount to is never revealed in statements of this kind. Corporation directors always explain to their stockholders that putting aside of such huge amounts for taxes on the ground that they don’t know just what kind of a tax bill Congress will pass and they have to be prepared, as good managers, for any emergency that may arise. Moreover, they usually add, we live in a period of uncertain times. Sound and conservative business practice dictates to us the necessity of storing up surpluses for the “rainy days” that may lie ahead. This may be sound business practice – if not on the grounds indicated by corporation directors – at least from the point of view of concealing fabulous profits. It might be added that profits statements never make any mention of huge salaries and bonuses paid to officers and directors. The tendency, however, is for these to increase and this becomes another effective method of concealing huge profits.
 
Government and Business
The profits picture is not complete without at least mentioning that the dependence of profits on government contracts brings with it a feature that can hardly be disagreeable to the corporations. Government contracts are always so worded, either through a cost-plus provision or some other device, that the huge profits of the big corporations are guaranteed by the government. There is no risk attached, except the risk that the war may end. The defenders of free private enterprise and “private initiative” may find the trend toward increasing government intervention in industry rather alarming – as indeed it is from some points of view – but they always conveniently forget to mention the one factor which endears state monopoly capitalism to the hearts of big business: profits are guaranteed and competition eliminated by the government.
The elimination of competition is essential for a smoothly functioning war economy. In a period such as this, anti-trust laws, which were always a joke, become an absolute farce. A by-product of this process is the rapid development of the tendency to eliminate the small business man. Not all the “defense clinics” or the appointment of Floyd B. Odlum of the huge investment trust, Atlas Corporation, to the task of increasing subcontracts, can conceal the fact that small business men are having increasing difficulty in getting the necessary raw materials. The operation of priorities necessarily means that the big corporations get bigger and the small ones are wiped out. To remain in business today, a manufacturer increasingly finds it necessary to have a private wire to Washington. But this the small business man cannot do, except in rare cases. The big manufacturer, however, has no difficulty at all in getting a hearing in Washington. He is already represented there by the dollar-a-year men.
Already, hundreds of small businesses have been forced to the wall. In the next six months, the figure will run into thousands. Even many large corporations are forced to close, at least temporarily, as the transition from a peace economy to a war economy is made. Government experts predict an increase of two million unemployed from this source alone during the next year.
In short, a war economy, while it may solve temporarily some of the problems of a dying capitalist order, only accentuates the basic contradictions inherent in capitalism. Lack of space alone prevents a detailed examination of all the economic effects of the developing war economy. Organizationally, the structure of capitalism is being changed in the direction of a far more complete development of state monopoly capitalism. The rapid rise in prices, the astronomical proportions of the government debt, the beginnings of rationing, the introduction of credit controls, the huge expansion of credit through increasing bank loans (accompanied by a decline in excess reserves), the rise of money in circulation to an all-time high – these are some of the indicators of the approaching storm.
 
Inflationary Dangers
Face to face with the threat of an uncontrolled inflation of gigantic proportions, the bourgeoisie stumbles around in its efforts to prevent it like a drunken man on a tightrope. Voluntary measures cannot bring a halt to rising prices. Bootlegging and quality depreciation continue apace. Tax anticipation notes and voluntary savings are a mere soporific. The American bourgeoisie must make up its mind in the course of the next few months to institute rigid price control and forced savings or the inflation will be beyond control. The American ruling class, this means, is squarely confronted with the dilemma: inflation or totalitarianism. There is no escape from this dilemma under capitalism. It is merely a question of time, and the time becomes increasingly short when the American bourgeoisie will be fairly stuck on one of the horns of this historical dilemma. And the worst of it is, from the capitalist point of view, that a pronounced trend in either direction will produce a revolutionary crisis.
At present we are confronted with a war economy running, at best, at 0 per cent efficiency. Production still lags way behind the demands of the war situation. Red tape and bureaucracy clog the wheels far more than is necessary under capitalism. The American war economy will become more effective. Of that there can be little doubt, although it may well require actual participation in a shooting war to bring this change about. By 1943–44, perhaps a bit sooner, the dénouément should be reached. And if, by some miracle, American capitalism weathers World War II without any fundamental changes having taken place, it will find that organizing the economy of the western hemisphere and of the entire world is a far more difficult task than that of organizing the domestic economy of the United States.
The thought of the transition to a peace-time economy makes the bourgeoisie shudder. And well they may, for a disillusioned and undefeated working class will hardly put up with the only solution the bourgeoisie can offer – a permanent war economy. The war economy cannot be made permanent without the establishment of an American fascism. And this requires far more than defeating Hitler. It means crushing the American workers.
Society has come to an absolute impasse, even in the richest and most highly developed of all capitalist countries, the United States. The fetters which bind the forces of production and condemn the overwhelming majority of the population to steadily increasing misery must be cast off. The only road that can avoid chaos and barbarism is the road that Marx outlined as the historic mission of the proletarian – the socialist emancipation of society. Much will undoubtedly happen before the issue is finally joined, but the decade of the 1940s will be decisive in determining whether mankind will march forward toward socialism or continue its relapse into barbarism.
 
 


Washington Merry-Go-Round of September 19 declares that President Roosevelt was positively shocked when Representative Carl Vinson, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, furnished a confidential report on shipyard profits. “One company making ordnance instruments for the Navy netted a neat 208 per cent! Some plane manufacturers are making as high as 150 per cent. Big shipbuilders are averaging 72 per cent on government contracts.” Some people do surprise easily. But what else could be expected when the Vinson-Trammell Act, limiting profits on naval orders to 8 per cent, was repealed at the start of the war program? Rumor hath it now that Vinson will propose to limit naval profits to 7 per cent. We WILL be surprised if such a measure goes through!

“Combined net profits of 112 producers of consumers goods in the first half of 1941 amounted to $165,734,689 after all tax provisions and other charges, compared with $141,260,170 in the same period last year, reflecting better gains after taxes than mast of the heavy industry groups thus far reviewed for the period.” (Kenneth L. Austin in the New York Times, September 21) And Mr. Austin has already reviewed the situation of some of the biggest war profiteering industries, such as chemicals. The profits of the big bosses are getting so big in all industries that they can’t even conceal them any more!
*
The above items attain real significance only when compared with the 1941 revenue bill, which was signed by the President on September 20. I have previously pointed out the gross inequities in this “Soak the Poor” bill. The conference between the House and Senate over their respective versions made virtually no changes of any importance from the Senate bill, as had been universally predicted. The income tax and excess profits tax provisions were unchanged. The burden of additional taxes is thrown almost exclusively on those who can least afford to pay. There were merely a few minor changes on some of the “hidden” or excise taxes. The tax on telephone calls, for example, is fixed at 6 per cent on local telephone bills, 10 per cent on long-distance calls costing more than 24 cents, and 10 per cent on telegraph, radio and cable messages. This “fair and equal” treatment of services used by the lower middle class and the workers, such as local telephones, with those used by the very wealthy, such as radio and cable messages, is typical of the perverted sense of justice that permeates the entire bill. Unless the trade unions and workers launch a real campaign for a genuine, 100 PER CENT EXCESS PROFITS TAX, WITHOUT ANY LOOPHOLES, they might as well resign themselves to footing the entire cost of the war.
*
The real boss of World War I, Wall Street’s white-haired boy, Barney Baruch, testified last week in connection with the pending price control bill. This outstanding representative of the ruling class in this country painted a very dark picture of what happens under inflation and what the aftermath of war may lead to. He was delightfully vague, however, on how to prevent these dire things from happening. The profit must be taken out of war. Yes, we agree, but how? Just establish price ceilings and everything will be hunky-dory. Freezing wages will not affect labor’s right to strike or the right of every worker to bargain collectively. No, it would just render the major weapons of labor absolutely useless.
Fairy tales aside, what Mr. Baruch was trying to tell the political representatives of the bosses is that if you want to lick Hitler you’ve got to use Hitler’s methods – that is, under capitalism. Said the duPonts’ family adviser: “If we are to keep the war from reaching these shores or win any war into which we are thrust, it will not be done by ‘business as usual’ but by the full mobilization of our economic resources as in 1918 and it must not be too little or loo late.” That he really didn’t mean the modest mobilization of 1918 but Hitler’s type of mobilization, which was swiped from the American Army’s M-Day plans, can be seen from the very next sentence: “Full mobilization means transforming American industry from a highly competitive economy to a practically single unitary system under which all producers will cooperate, sharing trade secrets, pooling patents, resources and facilities.”
Monopoly capitalism must be placed firmly in the saddle. This is the program recommended by Mr. Baruch. Anything or anybody that stands in its way must be pushed aside, crushed. This is the program of the National Association of Manufacturers and the big capitalists. It gives the lie to Baruch’s conclusion: The status quo of all should remain until the war is ended.” No, when things are changing very rapidly, as at present, no power on earth can keep the face of the world as it has been. Either the workers make up their minds to take what is their just due or the bosses will impose an American form of fascism on them.

A dispatch from Berlin, printed in the financial section of the New York Times, September 21, says: “Announcement that the Reich has sold its controlling interest in the Hamburg-American Line and in the North German Lloyd to a group of business men in Hamburg and Bremen took the financial market here by surprise. The step itself may be. in line with the accepted policy of the Nazi government, which on various occasions, has stressed its aversion to government ownership and to the operation of business concerns.” (Emphasis mine – F.D.) And some people still think that there is a “new” social order in Germany! It is still capitalism, to any but the blind, but it represents a further and logical development of capitalism – namely, state monopoly capitalism.
 



One of the most significant of recent developments is the publication by the National Resources Planning Board of a pamphlet entitled After Defense, What? Its contents are summarized in the New York Times of August 13.
The board, in outlining its post-war economic program, based itself on the assumption that World War II will end in 1944, at which time it estimated that the U.S. will be using 23,000,000 workers in war industries, plus 3,500,000 men in the armed services. As an indication of what is in store for us for the next three years, the report is very interesting. Its real value lies, however, in two extremely important things:

First, there is the recognition on the part of a semi-official government agency that we must plan NOW to prepare for the “colossal undertaking” of transferring these millions of men to peacetime activities, if complete economic breakdown and utter chaos are to be avoided.
 
Second, and most important, is the complete inadequacy of the program proposed by the National Resources Planning Board to accomplish this aim. It reveals, as clearly as anything can, the bankruptcy of capitalism.

It does not require much imagination to picture what will happen if the usual post-war depression is allowed to develop. Whether it be in 1944 or later, the questions asked by the board are of fundamental importance and are in the mind of every thinking person today: “What happens to the demobilized workers and veterans and their families? Will they be without work? Will they stop producing? Will the national income drop fifteen billion dollars or so as soon as the pent-Up demands are met? Will the succeeding drop in consumption throw others out of work and reduce national production and income another ten to twenty billion dollars?”
“If so,” says the board, “we shall be back again in the valley of the depression and a terrific new strain will be thrown on our whole system of political, social and economic life. The American people will never stand for this. Sooner or later they will step in and refuse to let matters work themselves out.”
In plain English, then, these learned intellects are telling the bosses: “If you don’t want a revolution after the war, you’ve got to take steps to prevent it now; continuing your usual policy of doing nothing will prove fatal.”
Let me put the matter another way. The era of free, competitive capitalism is over. It is not merely dying. It is dead. It cannot be resurrected, no matter how many pious declarations Messrs. Roosevelt and Churchill issue. The National Resources Planning Board – let credit be given where credit is due – at least recognizes this incontestable fact. But the real problem is HOW TO PLAN for maintaining maximum production, full employment and rising standards of living in peacetime. Here the capitalist statesmen and economists, when they don’t show annoyance at the posing of such far-off problems (peace aims), are hopelessly confused and bewildered. And no wonder! They sense only too well the terrible longing of the masses for peace, security and freedom. But all they can offer the people under an outworn capitalist system is the peace of the graveyard, the security of regimentation and the freedom of the concentration camp. The difficulty lies in the fact that the only type of planning possible under capitalism is the fascist type, which inevitably means more wars and widespread misery and starvation.
How to plan the abolition of poverty in the midst of plenty – that is the question. The National Resources Planning Board would have government, business, workers and farmers cooperate now in the establishment of a planned transition to peacetime activity. Among their suggested plans are: a dismissal allowance for all demobilized men; gradual liquidation of government contracts, priorities and price controls; public works projects, particularly transportation and housing; research to develop new industrial products; plans to expand the service industries – more medical care, education and entertainment; new forms of social security and work relief; new financial plans for covering the costs of these projects; and lease-lend aid for the peoples of Europe until they can get on their feet.
Let us grant that all of these are worthwhile aims. Can they be achieved under capitalism? Not in any genuine manner, such as will guarantee full employment and a rising standard of living. Why haven’t we had genuine slum-clearance and low-cost housing projects prior to the war? Why, in spite of all the New Deal reforms, does one-third of the nation remain ill-fed, ill-housed and ill-clothed? As soon as the government tries to respond to the pressure exerted by masses of discontented people by instituting a few reforms, what happens? Big business, through its control of all the avenues of propaganda, turns loose its high-paid publicists, who unleash clever campaigns to show that such reforms are too costly and will bankrupt the government, or that they are illegal and unconstitutional, or that they undermine the system of free, private enterprise.
If the government sells electricity at cost, which can easily be done, as demonstrated by the TVA, this is government competition with private business. Private business must operate at a profit. To get its profits it must sell things at two or three times the rates charged by government-owned enterprise. Further, monopolies have arisen in every industry for the simple reason that, through monopolies, production can be restricted, prices can be raised, wages can be lowered – and thus profits can be maintained at a high level.
Unfortunately for the National Resources Planning Board, the problem begins where they end. The wheels of industry will not turn, under capitalism, unless the manufacturers, bankers and landlords can get their profits. Is there any reason why manufacturers who refused to manufacture war materials under the “defense” program until their profits were guaranteed by the government, should suddenly manufacture the necessities of life once the war is over – unless they can likewise get their profits? Countless inventions have long been suppressed by big corporations because releasing them would interfere with their profits on existing investments. Why should they now develop new industries on a large scale so as to give employment to everyone?
There was a time when the capitalists, in their pursuit of profits, did bring about a general improvement in living conditions – although millions still lived in poverty. But, as the saying goes, “Them days are gone forever.” Profits can be maintained today only by having the masses suffer a steadily declining standard of living. This soon makers all reforms a luxury and an expense that the capitalists cannot afford. Once the monopoly capitalists are confronted with such a situation, they finance the fascist gangsters to power. The recent history of Europe leaves no doubt on this score.
But even if a schoolchild could propose more concrete and realistic plans than those of the National Resources Planning Board, this does not mean that the workers must give up all hope of a decent life. The Brookings Institute, a very conservative institution, long ago estimated that the U.S., with its abundant resources and technical skills, can give everyone the equivalent of a $5,000 a year income.
The trade unions must take up the problem and the suggestions of the National Resources Planning Board. They must establish their own planning boards. They must bombard Washington with concrete, realistic plans for producing enough food, clothing, shelter and other things for everyone. They must educate the country so that the masses understand how the good things of life can be distributed to everybody. And if profits have to be sacrificed (AS THEY MUST) in order to achieve a decent, rational and democratic existence – well, then let profits be sacrificed. Why should the selfish interests and privileges of a mere handful of people condemn the overwhelming majority of the population to perpetual hunger and misery?
And we are confident that once the workers start thinking about these problems – which are immediate and practical problems – they will find that only a workers’ government, democratically organized and controlled, producing for the use and needs of the population, can solve the manifold problems that confront us today.
 



Dividends on stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange were 8.2 per cent HIGHER in the first halt of 1941 than in the first half of 1940. Not bad, considering that 1940 was the most profitable year since 1929. But look at the increase in the war babies. Aviation stocks increased their dividends by 104.6 per cent in this period. The shipbuilding industry came next with a vise of 94 per cent, followed by the steel industry with a rise of 74 per cent.
All told. 543 listed common stocks yielded approximately $956,705,000 in dividends in the first six months of 1941. This suggests that those industries that have granted wage increases due to the fighting power of the workers not only can easily afford it, but can afford much more. This conclusion is heavily reinforced when it is recalled that most of the profits nowadays are not being paid out in dividends, but are being salted away as war chests in surplus accounts as well as being paid out to officers in the form of bonuses. The argument that was made by the steel companies, for example, that a 10 per cent wage increase would bankrupt them unless they raised prices a corresponding amount is thus shown up for the fraud that everyone knew it to be at the time.
Also, it is worth pointing out that the fears of the companies that higher taxes would eat up all their profits have likewise proved to be groundless. If the government is looking for more money from taxes, it seems to us that
the logical thing to do is to raise corporation tax -- not the 5 per cent proposed, but SUBSTANTIALLY. This, plus a 100 per cent excess profits tax, would raise, more than enough money so that there would be no necessity for increased excise taxes on necessities, or for cutting off 700,000 workers from WPA. For higher taxes on industry, and higher wages paid by industry!
*
The excess profits tax proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee remains a fraud in spite of the additional levy of 10 per cent. In the first place, a tax running from 35 to 60 per cent on profits in excess of “normal” is hardly one which will prevent the accumulation of huge fortunes from war orders. Further, the rejection by the committee of the President’s proposal to eliminate the average earnings method of computing excess profits means that corporations still retain the choice of this method or the capital investment method. The latter method, at least, would consider all profits over 8 per cent of the capital invested as excess. The average earnings method, it will be recalled, considers profits above the average earned from 1936 through 1939 (with some “liberalizing” amendments already passed) as excess. For many of the big corporations, who have most of the “defense” orders, the average earnings method allows them a “normal” profit far in excess of 8 per cent! The real indication, however, of the fact that Congress has no intention of passing a real excess profits tax is the inclusion of a provision which adds 25 per cent exemption – to the existing 100 per cent exemption – on new capital invested by corporations. Previously, it cost a corporation absolutely nothing to build a new plant, on which, of course, it would make its customary profit. Now, corporations are to be paid, in reality, to build new plants or expand old ones!

Ten days after American exporters charged the British with re-selling American Lend-Lease materials to Latin America, the British agreed to restrict their trade competition with the United States. The incident furnishes a revealing sidelight on how imperialism conducts its war for “democracy.” American exporters have repeatedly complained that they have been meeting with increasing British competition in the South American market, particularly in such lines as steel, machinery, rubber, paper and textiles. In most cases, the items were those in which the British are reported to have a shortage and which they have been importing from the U.S. under the Lend-Lease Act.
The Americans claimed that the British were either re-exporting these American-made products or were using the American products and shipping an equivalent amount of British products. The Americans didn’t at all like the idea of the American government financing their rivals, even if they were allies. When private complaints brought no results, they decided to make the matter public.
“The crowning blow in the succession of incidents, according to exporters, came three weeks ago when a company in Buenos Aires which was on the British blacklist entered the market for quantities of paper. According to exporters, the order was substantial and at the insistence of an English supplier the name of the Buenos Aires buyer was removed from the blacklist long enough to enable the British company to bid for the business, and get its money, whereupon the company was put back on the blacklist again.” – (New York Times, July 6)
Comment on this would really be superfluous, but we suggest, in the interests of free trade for American capitalists, that perhaps the President ought to include British firms on his export blacklist.

General Robert E. Wood, chairman of the board of Sears, Roebuck & Co. and national chairman of the America First Committee, has resigned as chairman of the Economic Policy Committee of the National Association of Manufacturers. This resignation, “caused by inability to find time to devote to his duties as chairman of the NAM committee,” was made about a month ago but it was not announced until the committee meeting of July 11 when Thomas E. McCabe, president of the Scott Paper Co., was chosen as General Wood’s successor. In announcing his acceptance of the chairmanship, Mr. McCabe said:
“The impact of guns, shells, tanks and planes upon our heretofore peaceful butter-and-egg economy may have greater repercussions than any bomb deliberately fabricated to create havoc. It is not at all improbable that hundreds or even thousands of manufacturing plants will be shut down within the year unless they are able to convert their production to defense work.” (Emphasis mine – F.D.)
The chairman of the most important committee of all American industry thus sees as the only alternatives for the consumer goods industries – either stopping production, or shifting to instruments of war. Out of their own mouths the capitalists stand convicted as the bankrupt managers of a bankrupt social system.
 



WALL STREET EXPERIENCES several million share days. Does this mean a revival, which will parallel the tremendous rise in the stock market that occurred during World War I? One of the mysteries of World War II has been the continuance of the stock market in a state of unprecedented lethargy. The stock market, where the capitalists trade in certificates of ownership, claims to dividends and interest that the manufacturing bosses extract from the toil and sweat of their workers, is supposed to be a barometer of business conditions. Business has been booming; production has reached all-time highs due to the developing war economy; profits in many cases exceed the 1929 highs – and yet Wall Street has been in the doldrums. Prices are very low; business has been so poor that the brokers cannot, in many cases, even cover overhead expenses, resulting in forced mergers and consolidations. The best index of Wall Street depression in the midst of a business boom has been the decline in the price o£ seats on the Stock Exchange – the exclusive country club of the big financiers and speculators. Seats, which not so long ago used to sell for well over $100,000, are now in the twenty thousand dollar levels. Almost anyone – that is, for a small fee – con now buy the privilege of trading in stocks and bonds.
Interest is running very high among the capitalists concerning whether a real revival in the stock market is actually under way at last. While the workers don’t own any stocks and bonds, the advanced workers will follow this development with almost as much interest as the capitalists, for it is always important to know what the class enemy is thinking and doing. Moreover, a stock market boom, if it follows previous experience, always ends in a crash which makes the ensuing depression that much worse. The after-effects of the boom during World War I were not felt until late 1920 and culminated in the 1921 crash, which was resumed after the temporary prosperity of the 1920s in 1929.
Opinion in Wall Street is divided on the question of why the sudden increase in business, and whether a revival is really under way. Some claim that the continued resistance of the Russian armies is chiefly responsible for the rise in Wall Street. They interpret this as meaning a more favorable military outlook for the Allies (that is, for American imperialism) , which it surely is if Hitler is really bogged down on two fronts. American capitalist property and investments are in a sounder position – worth more – hence the rise in Wall Street and the increased volume of business.
Others say that some of the increased purchasing power being pumped into the hands of the public by increased government expenditures is finally finding its natural outlet – the stock market. In support of this contention, they cite the recent report of the Department of Commerce to the effect that income payments to individuals in the month of May reached a rate of $86 billion annually. This is the highest on record and compares with an estimated national income of some $75 billion in 1940 and the previous high in 1929 of some $82 billion. Increasing public confidence – that is, surplus incomes in the hands of the big capitalists and the upper middle class – means increasing support of the stock market.
Still others base their optimistic forecasts on the increasingly high profits being made by practically all sections of American business and the “realistic” tax proposals now being considered by the House Ways and Means Committee. They find especially heartening the apparent tendency of Congress to keep the excess profits tax at ridiculously low levels. Altogether, they find no tendency on the part of Congress to pass taxes which will discourage private initiative! Hence, Wall Street should reflect these increasing profits and the market should go up.
Undoubtedly there is some truth in all of the contentions. However, in estimating the prospects of capital’s colossal legalized gambling institution, known as the New York Stock Exchange and allied exchanges throughout the country, it is first necessary to understand why the stock market has not paralleled the rise in business during the past two years. Only then are we in a position to estimate whether the new forces, mentioned above, appear to be sufficiently powerful to offset the old forces that have kept Wall Street in a state of continued depression.
Here we are confronted with a powerful tendency, which appears to mark an entirely new technical stage in the process of accumulating capital. Hitherto, the chief legitimate function of the stock market in the capitalist economic system has been as a means of raising capital for corporations either for the purpose of floating new enterprises or adding capital to existing corporations, or replacing capital that has been used up by existing corporations. This function, beginning in the middle of the nineteenth century with the financing of the railroads, was made necessary by the increasing size of capital accumulations required to launch a capitalist enterprise. More capital was needed than could possibly be furnished by one man, or by small groups (partnerships). Through the device of the stock market, capital could easily and quickly be raised from all sections of the capitalist class and concentrated in the hands of a few finance capitalists, or their agents, who would direct it where it would do them the most good – that is, earn the highest rate of profit.
For some time, and with increasing frequency in the past few years, there has appeared a tendency for existing corporations to raise all the additional capital they have required, either to take care of depreciation or expansion or both through their own accumulated reserves of surplus capital and undivided profits. This is particularly true of the very large corporations. The very statistics of the Department of Commerce, referred to above, bear this out. Dividend payments have risen 5 per cent over last year, but entrepreneurial returns are up 9 per cent. Putting the matter very simply, almost one-half of the profits of corporations are not being paid out in the form of dividends to the stockholders but are being put aside in surplus and undivided profits accounts. These, can be used at the discretion of the management and board of directors for whatever purpose they wish. Most managements explain these steps by the necessity of piling up reserves for a “rainy day” in these uncertain times. But time and again, the large corporations use these reserves for routine capital financing.
This is having a noticeable effect on the structure of the capitalist class. It means the further concentration of control of huge enterprises in fewer and fewer hands – particularly in the hands of the management. The officers and directors of the large corporations become increasingly conservative as they rely more and more on these new methods of self-financing. The expansion of existing enterprises and, above all, the building of new enterprises, is resisted more and more by this newly-elevated capitalist bureaucracy. It becomes the most conservative section of society and acts, in the struggle for its increasing independence and enhancement and preservation of its own power, as a complete brake on the development of the productive forces. Even the imperialist war economy suffers as a result of this innate conservatism of the capitalist managers. The full implications of this trend are only in the process of being observed. They will require a separate theoretical analysis.
Meanwhile, Wall Street and those capitalists who operate on the exchanges have been suffering. I£ a number of big corporations can finance themselves completely or partially through their own accumulated reserves of surplus capital, this means less business for Wall Street. If less dividends are being paid out, there is less reason for the public, that is, the small capitalists, who had their fingers burnt badly in the 1929 crash, to invest their small, individual savings in the stock market. This factor has been the main one in explaining the depressed state of Wall Street. Wall Street has been further undermined by the liquidation of a large portion of British-held American securities through private deals, without benefit of the stock exchange mechanism. In addition, of course, the war has not been going too favorably for American imperialism. Also, many capitalists are genuinely frightened by the increasing tendency toward government control of industry that is an inevitable part of the process of developing a total war economy.
Wall Street, in one of the most widely-advertised publicity campaigns that it has ever put on, has tried to offset these unfavorable factors, as well as the strongly developed public trait of blaming all economic ills on Wall Street, by electing as its new president of the New York Stock Exchange Mr. Emil Schram, head of the RFC. Mr. Schram’s duties will be those of a public relations counselor. It will be his task to establish “better relations” with the government and to increase public confidence in Wall Street, to the end that more suckers can be induced to part with their savings.
It is always difficult to estimate the immediate prospects of Wall Street. But its long-term prospects are indeed gloomy. The tendency for corporations to depend increasingly on self-financing and thus cut themselves loose from Wall Street will mean that Wall Street’s main function will be more and more limited to the financing of new enterprises – and there cannot be too many of these in the general period of capitalist decline. The government will be forced to siphon more and more of the excess savings of the middle class into government channels through increased taxation and, eventually, compulsory savings for the purpose of maintaining government borrowing of a non-inflationary character. Moreover, the defeat of German imperialism looms as an increasingly long and costly undertaking.
These unhappy prospects for Wall Street over a long period of time seem to find reinforcement in the announcement of a sharp increase in the “short” position in Wall Street. The shorts are the speculators who operate in the hope that prices will go down. Wall Street rarely permits sentiment to interfere with its cold-blooded business calculations. In spite of all the ballyhoo, then, there is increasing opinion within Wall Street that there will be no immediate boom in the stock market. In any case, it appears quite safe to predict that this time there will be no run-away boom on the 1916-1920 or 1926-1929 models. Any rise that does take place will be of a temporary and limited character, depending largely on temporary conjunctural factors.
All of which helps to point to the inescapable conclusion that capitalism is getting old – in fact, old to the point of senility. No rational economic order requires such an archaic and bloodthirsty institution as the stock market. The financing of new enterprises, as well as the expansion and maintenance of old ones, today requires the establishment of a planned economy. The trend toward the establishment of planned economy is an irresistible one; moreover, it appears on a world scale. The question is merely whether it will be the totalitarian, bureaucratic and reactionary planning of the capitalist or Stalinist variety, or whether it will be the democratic and progressive planning of socialism. In the last analysis, it is the workers, particularly the American workers, who will have the final say on this historically decisive question.
 
 


The first witness to testify before the House Banking and Currency Committee concerning the Price Control Bill was Leon Henderson, administrator of the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply. When Mr. Henderson got to the question of agricultural prices, he was questioned about the reason for the bill containing the provision that the ceiling on farm prices be 110 per cent of parity instead of the Administration’s long-sought goal of 100 per cent of parity.
While Mr. Henderson hesitated and looked toward Chairman Steagall, who took credit for this change in a press interview. Representative Ford of California interrupted: “I answer – votes.” Never was a truer word spoken by a congressman. All the legislation in regard to the economic controls to be established under the war economy has been subject to an old-fashioned log-rolling process. But the provision for 110 per cent of parity on farm prices represents one of the greatest triumphs the congressional farm bloc has ever scored in long years of pressure politics and, by the same token, a tremendous blow at the standard of living of the vast majority of the working population of this country.
 
The Background
To understand what is involved, we must first briefly consider the meaning of “parity” and the situation of the farm population, particularly as affected by World War II. Parity, according to the dictionary, means equality. The word first came into prominence during the 1920s when farm lobbyists and farmers’ organizations, especially the Farm Bureau, an organization representing the more well-to-do commercial farmers, used it to describe their goal for farm recovery.
The farmers of the United States, for a series of historical reasons, had entered into an era of permanent depression following World War I. The Armistice of 1918 left them with terrific surpluses on hand, particularly in the staple crops, wheat and cotton. The colonial areas of the world – Canada, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, India, Egypt – had greatly increased their production of these commodities under the stimulus of war-time demand. Cheaper production in these new territories and imperialist trade rivalries meant the steady loss of foreign markets for the American farmer. While more clothing, bread and other necessities which are made from farm products could easily be used by the American population, this is not possible under capitalism to any great extent. For capitalism means an economy of scarcity and insufficient purchasing power in the hands of the vast majority who produce the wealth of this country – the workers.
Consequently, the prices of farm products began to decline. Meanwhile, the prices of industrial products (the things the farmer must buy) either remained high or went higher. As a result, the purchasing power of the farmer’s dollar went down steadily. The farmers wanted more purchasing power; that is, they wanted higher prices for farm commodities in relation to the prices of industrial products which they had to buy. They said they wanted equality between farm prices and industrial prices. Hence, the slogan of “parity.” But – and here is the vital question – what period should be selected as an example of parity, of the proper relationship between farm and industrial prices? The farm organizations examined the government’s statistics and selected the period from 1909–1914 as “normal” for the relationship between farm and industrial prices.
 
“Normal” or “Abnormal”?
What is meant by “normal” is always, of course, a difficult question to answer. The fact of the matter is, however, as any examination of price statistics will show, that the period from 1909–1914 represents the highest possible parity base which could be selected in the 20th century. It is distinctly an abnormal period, if by “normal” we mean what is most usual or typical. The period from 1909–1914 represents an extremely prosperous period for farmers. This applies, to be sure, only to the capitalist farmers; but the whole discussion of parity prices is only concerned with the relatively well-to-do capitalist farmers, representing at the most some 35 per cent of the farm population who produce 89 per cent of the total value of all farm crops which are marketed. The majority of the farmers who live in real poverty and distress, the tenant farmers, share-croppers and agricultural laborers, are certainly not the concern of the congressional farm bloc, for parity cannot help them. Only a fundamental change in the economic system and a redistribution of the land can improve the status of these truly forgotten people of America.
The first attempts to achieve parity under Coolidge and Hoover were miserable failures. They are important only as confirmation of the necessity for government intervention in solving the problems created by a declining capitalist order. The onset of the great depression of 1929 only made matters worse tor the farmers.
In 1933 came the New Deal, promising all things to all men. Recognizing the strategic situation of the farm bloc in Congress and the great voting strength of the farm states, the New Deal political strategists promised parity to the farmers. Their first effort, the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, was a colossal blunder and a crime against humanity. They tried to raise the prices of farm products by ordering the farmers to plow under every third row of cotton and wheat – at a time when millions were going ragged for want of clothing and starving for want of food. The slight increase in farm prices which followed was largely due to the subsequent droughts.
The only important result of this first New Deal attempt to solve the farm problem was to strengthen the farm bloc in Congress. The farm bloc was now in the position of being able to blackmail the Roosevelt Administration on any important measure that it wanted to pass. Time after time, the farm bloc, in return for votes supporting the general Roosevelt program, received important concessions in the form of desired subsidies to the CAPITALIST farmers. It has been horse trading on a grand scale.
 
World War II
The failure of the Roosevelt farm program was emphasized by the election of 1936, which showed the farm belt clearly swinging away from the Democratic Party back to its traditional Republican allegiance. This called for heroic measures, and finally resulted in the passage of the AAA of 1938, which incorporates the goal of parity into existing legislation. Nobody quite knew how this goal was to be achieved, but the act, sometimes referred to as the Omnibus Act, contained every possible scheme that capitalist politicians could think of. It was rapidly being demonstrated a failure, in spite of the addition of the Food Stamp Plan, when, in September 1939, World War II broke out.
The immediate effect of World War II on the farmers was the reverse of World War I. In World War I, when Europe turned its fields into human slaughter houses, the Allies bought huge quantities of farm products in the U.S. This time, however, the newly developed colonial areas of the world could more than supply the needs of England and France. Moreover, the Allies, particularly the English, found it necessary to conserve their cash for the purchase of American munitions and planes. England actually reduced its normal purchases of cotton and tobacco from the U.S. As a consequence, the government warehouses have accumulated huge surpluses of the staple crops. The situation has been farther aggravated by the so-called “Hemisphere Defense Policy.” In the long run, this means that American imperialism will import agricultural raw materials from Latin America (products like wheat, cotton, meat, hides and copper, which, far the most part, compete directly with the American farmer) in return for its exports of capital and industrial commodities.
The pressure from the farm states to relieve the situation grew tremendously. Every step of the Roosevelt war program, in order to pass Congress, has had to be accompanied by concessions to the farm bloc. Meanwhile, the expenditure of billions of dollars for war by the government has had an inflationary effect on all prices, particularly farm prices. Mr. Henderson, in his testimony, stated the following percentage relationship of farm prices to parity as of July 15: rice 102, cottonseed 120, butter fat 112, milk equivalent 102, chickens 111, eggs 100, hogs 106, beef cattle 127, veal calves 114, lamb 117, Maryland tobacco 188, wool 149, corn 81, wheat 73, oats 62, and cotton 87. THE WHOLESALE COMMODITY INDEX OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS SHOWS THAT FOOD PRICES ARE RISING EVEN FASTER THAN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF PRICES – WHOLESALE FOOD PRICES HAVING RISEN ABOUT 60 PER CENT SINCE THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR II.
 
Price Control Bill
Under the terms of the Price Control Bill, as introduced in the House of Representatives, agricultural prices will have a ceiling 110 per cent of parity – that is, 10 per cent more than the farm propagandists ever dared to demand. From the figures quoted by Mr. Henderson, it will mean a tremendous increase in the price of most of the important food and clothing items in the worker’s budget. Moreover, those prices which are above parity as of July 29 will have this higher level maintained as an alternative price ceiling. The price of meats, for example, will remain at the present extremely high levels. On the average, therefore, the workers are confronted with a bill whose avowed purpose is to prevent higher prices and inflation, but which will guarantee a 20 PER CENT INCREASE IN PRICES. Moreover, it is only the wealthy farmers and big middlemen who will benefit from this handout at the expense of the workers and the poor farmers. All of which only serves to emphasize once again the extreme injustices of the capitalist economic system, particularly in wartime, and the absolute necessity for workers’ control of price-fixing.
 



The developing war economy in the United Slates has finally reached the point where every person in the country will feel iis effects in the most direct and immediate sense. It has been announced from Washington that price-fixing legislation will be introduced into Congress this week. The immediate reason for this drastic step is that the inflationary movement of prices is threatening to get out of hand. This would cause a tremendous increase in the cost of the armaments program, as well as a serious weakening of civilian morale. The experiences in World War I and since have taught the capitalists that rapidly rising prices must be prevented at all costs, if they would preserve their system from social disintegration. Labor Action has repeatedly pointed out that the capitalists are face to face with a dilemma that free, competitive capitalism cannot solve. The spending of billions and billions of dollars for war purposes means either inflation or totalitarianism. There is no escape from this dilemma under capitalism. Leon Henderson, director of the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply, has already admitted that voluntary control of prices is breaking down. Many corporations simply refuse to abide by the price ceilings, that is, the maximum prices set by Mr. Henderson. Others are getting around the price ceilings by producing articles of inferior quality – without, of course, advertising this fact to the consumer or to the government. Still others are developing a very refined illegal or bootleg trade, especially in certain key raw materials. All of ‘this’ is perfectly natural and inevitable under a capitalism where the urge to obtain profits takes precedence over everything else.
 
More Money to Buy Less Goods
If a manufacturer finds that his costs have increased due to (1) increased wages as a result of labor’s drive to improve its standard of living or simply to maintain living conditions at existing levels (2) higher prices for raw materials, as a result of higher shipping costs imposed by the war and higher prices for agricultural raw materials as a result of the government’s farm program, or (3) higher taxes, as a result’ of the government’s attempt to defray somewhat the cost of the war program, he will not voluntarily content himself with a reduced profit. He is in business to make the maximum profit possible and his concept of patriotism gives him the moral right, and even the obligation, to pursue his profit-making instincts to the utmost. Moreover, if he should attempt to curb them, he will soon find himself swallowed up by a bigger capitalist. Consequently, he raises the prices of the things he produces and sells.
This development is clearly shown by the fact that wholesale prices have risen almost 50 per cent since the outbreak of World War II and by the current rise in retail prices which is rapidly threatening to equal that of wholesale prices. This development is absolutely irresistible as the war economy expands in size and scope. For it has meant a tremendous increase in available consumer purchasing power, accompanied at the same time by a considerable decrease in the production of consumer goods. The shift from consumer goods industries to war industries is only beginning to get under way in this country, but it will now proceed at a very rapid rate. Putting the matter in its most simple terms, more people have more money with which to buy less and less goods. Prices must go up under such circumstances unless controlled by the government.
 
Alternatives Under Capitalism
Government control of prices, however, is not a simple matter – as the British and American governments have already learned. If done on a piecemeal basis, it is incomplete and only serves to create antagonisms and dissatisfaction without preventing inflation.
“It is realized by the Administration,” says a dispatch to the New York Times of July 18, “that unless prices are strictly controlled or consumer buying is kept down by some other means, inflation can scarcely be averted. A study of German methods of price control, recently published by the Commerce Department indicated, however, that control of prices is not effective unless (1) all prices are controlled, (2) wages, rents and dividends are also controlled.”
Here, the capitalists run squarely into the second horn of the dilemma. If prices are not controlled, there will be inflation, with all its catastrophic consequences. On the other hand, if prices are controlled, it must be a strict and complete control in order to be effective. Half-way measures will not suffice, as the experience of England clearly shows. The only way that inflation can be prevented under a capitalist war economy is to follow the German method. Rigid control of all prices means complete government control of the entire economy. The government will decide how much profit the capitalist will make, how much rent the landlord should receive, how much wages the worker should get. The government, in effect, will decide where industries are to be built, whose capital and how much of it will be used to build the necessary war industries, what workers will work and where they will work, and under what conditions they will work. Such a complete ordering of ‘people’s lives, by a government, in this era of capitalist decay, means totalitarianism – no matter how pleasantly it may he dressed up by clever propagandists. In other words, the only way that inflation can be prevented under capitalism is through the adoption of fascist, totalitarian methods.
This is already understood by certain sections of the population. It will soon be understood by everyone with eyes to see, for price-fixing means arbitrary control of the dollar. Arbitrary control of the dollar means an attempt to freeze the class struggle. At present, each class in society and each group within each class uses its own peculiar methods of struggle to obtain more dollars. The dollar, so to speak, organizes the class struggle in an orderly manner. If the dollar ceases to have this function, as would be the case under complete price-fixing, a substitute must be found; otherwise, the existing society disintegrates. The only substitute that can be found under existing conditions is the armed might of the state. Soldiers with bayonets and policemen with clubs and revolvers, backed up by the courts and the prisons, will enforce the price-fixing decrees.
To be sure, a workers’ state, that is, a state organized and controlled by the majority of the population in their own interests, could take care of production and price problems through the method of democratic economic planning. This is not in any way to be confused or identified with the barbaric, bureaucratic and totalitarian planning that exists in Stalin’s Russia. In fact, a genuine workers’ state in this country of virtually unlimited natural resources and a very highly developed technique of production based on a high productivity of labor, could probably maintain a war economy, necessitated by the requirements of the struggle against Hitlerisrn, without any decline in the standard of living whatsoever. In fact, a proper utilization of our immense resources, both human and natural, would probably witness a rising standard of living – even under a war economy.
 
Big Business Defends Its Interests
Unfortunately we do not have a workers’ state at present. Mr. Roosevelt heads a capitalist state. Under a capitalist state, the whole program becomes transformed into one of getting the prices in which you are interested favorably fixed in relation to all other prices. This explains the heavy influx of dollar-a-year big business men into various governmental posts in Washington. “If there must be price-fixing,” say the capitalists, “we’ll do it. Then we can be sure that there will be no interference with our profits.” Senator Bankhead, a representative of the big cotton plantation owners, is reported in the press as having challenged any move toward pegging (fixing) prices of agricultural commodities unless controls were fixed all along the line on wages, salaries, rents and industrial commodities. He also warned that any effort to put a maximum price on cotton, either by direct action on the staple or by fixing a price on manufactured cotton goods which would operate to depress the price of raw cotton below 20 cents a pound, would meet “strenuous and determined opposition from the friends of the farmers in and out of Congress.” The price of cotton, it must be added, is at present about 16 cents a pound, having risen about 6 cents since the beginning of the year. This represents the highest price raw cotton has reached in a decade.
Thus we see the representatives of capitalists and farmers descending on Washington in droves to defend their respective interests in this all-important matter of price-fixing. What are the leaders of the trade unions doing about the matter? So far, except for some pious declarations by Murray and Green against control of wages, the working class has been absolutely silent, as if it were totally unaware that the problem exists NOW.
 
What the Workers Must Do
The workers cannot take the position that there should be no control of prices, for the workers suffer more than any other section of society from inflation. And yet, of course, the workers would be the real losers from a totalitarian development. This does not mean that the situation is absolutely hopeless. Certain actions can and must be taken First of all, the workers must be educated to understand what is involved in this question of price-fixing. This is primarily the responsibility of the trade unions. They, if they are to do this educational job properly, must immediately get away from the absolutely fatal notion that a totalitarian system developed as a result of the necessity to fix prices will disappear once the war is over. This is 1941 – not 1918. The war is clearly going to be a long and costly one. Even if American imperialism emerges the victor, it will be far too weak to give up the totalitarian controls instituted during wartime.
Secondly, the workers must send their delegations to Washington to defend their own interests in regard to the fixing of prices. The trade unions clearly have the power to do this, provided they have the will.
Thirdly, and most important, the workers must insist on workers’ control of price-fixing. After all the workers represent the overwhelming majority of the population. Why shouldn’t prices be fixed in the interests of this vast majority, rather than (as is now the case) in the interests of a small, exploiting minority? Big business men will never fix prices in the interests of the workers. The democratic method would have the majority fix the prices – since they must be fixed – in the interests of the majority. This could be done very simply in the case of commodity prices, by having a price control board for each commodity or each group of related commodities on which the majority represents the workers. Again, for the fixing of basic prices for wages, rent and interest, there must be a general price control board firmly controlled by the workers. Only in this way can the workers have any guarantee at all that the twin evils of inflation and totalitarianism will be avoided. Of course, in the long run, as I have tried to make clear, the real solution of the problem calls for an end to capitalism and the establishment of a workers’ state as a necessary transitional stop on the road to socialism.
 



After three months of consideration the House Ways and Means Committee brought in a proposal to raise $3,529,200,000 in new taxes. It is expected that the federal government will raise between nine and ten billion dollars from existing taxes. The additional revenue, provided there is no increase in expenditures, will be covered by taxes. The remainder will be raised through borrowing. It also means that this is the largest tax bill in the history of the country. Just a reminder that war costs money.
The bill is really a case of the mountain laboring and bringing forth a mouse. None of the basic issues are tackled. Recognizing that this is decidedly a compromise measure. Representative Doughton, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, following the lead of President Roosevelt, announced, in pleading for a “gag” rule to speed the debate, that the committee would have to consider a new tax bill for next year which would probably broaden the income tax base and levy a federal sales tax. These have been the basic demands of the bosses, who, as usual, try to throw the main burden of taxation onto the backs of the masses. On the other hand, the bill sidesteps the issue of imposing a genuine excess profits tax by merely increasing the excess profits rates a piddling 10 per cent.
 
Joint Returns
The most highly publicized feature of the new tax bill – the only part of the bill open to debate in the House of Representatives – is the proposal to compel married couples to file a joint tax return. A storm of protest has risen from press and pulpit against this measure on the ground that it penalizes marriage, will encourage divorce and immorality, and breaks down the sanctity of the home. At this writing it appears that the joint return, designed to raise more than $300 million, will be eliminated.
However, the joint return doesn’t mean higher taxes for the wealthy, for the wives of the rich don’t work. It is true that they may have separate incomes in the form of inheritance or property gifts from their husbands; but the main burden of the joint return would fall on those middle class and working class families where both husband and wife work, with combined incomes ranging from $4,000 to $10,000. Since the greatest number of working women come from the ranks of the working class, a broadening of the income tax base and a lowering of exemptions – as is proposed for next year – would result in the joint return affecting the upper strata of the workers more than any other group. This is one of the main dangers inherent in the proposal. On this practical ground alone, leaving aside the fundamental questions of the family and the institution of marriage, the joint return should be opposed.
The bulk of the new tax revenue is to be raised from corporate and individual taxpayers – nearly two and a half billion dollars. In comparing the additional amounts to be raised from corporations and individuals, we see the manner in which the refusal to levy a 100 per cent excess profits tax and substantially higher corporation taxes, is allowing the big bosses to escape at the expense of the middle and working classes. New taxes from corporations are expected to raise $935,000,000. New taxes from individuals will raise an expected $1,521,000,000 (the big increase in the surtax rates falling on those making from $2,000 net income to $10,000 net income). This means an increase of 72.7 per cent in the taxes paid by individuals as against an increase of only 35.8 per cent in the taxes paid by corporations. In the words of Godfrey N. Nelson, tax expert of the New York Times: “Charging themselves with the duty of raising an enormous additional amount of revenue, the Congress has made the burden of such load to fall disproportionately upon the individual taxpayer. It has been said that we shall pay the additional taxes even if we have to borrow on do so.” To enable the middle class to pay these new taxes, the Treasury is obligingly selling “tax anticipation” notes.
 
Power to Destroy
”The power to tax,”’ goes the well known saying, “is the power to destroy.” In this case, what is involved is the beginning of the destruction of the middle class, the traditional bulwark of American capitalism. The far-reaching social implication of burden of the middle class will only be seen in the years to come, but in its own way it is already an indication of the approaching revolutionary crisis in the United States. One of the most penetrating predictions of Marx was that in which he predicted the gradual disappearance of the middle class as capitalism matured and began to decay. This prediction has often been attacked as incorrect, and the United States, with its vast middle class, cited as proof of Marx’s error. But, even if somewhat belated, the middle class IS being wiped out (by the big capitalists). The process, which began with the onset of the great depression of 1929, – particularly on the tax front.
The impression has been carefully cultivated by the boss press that the workers have escaped “paying their share of the new taxes.” The Republican minority of the Ways and Means Committee, while it couldn’t agree on any specific measures, submitted a minority report attacking the New Deal spending and calling virtually for the elimination of WPA, NYA and CCC appropriations. To them, of course, the existence of 5,000,000 and more unemployed is of no importance. But the workers have not escaped. They will not be taxed directly, rather they will be made to suffer the most vicious forms of taxation – excise or indirect taxes. An additional $900,000,000 is to be raised in excise taxes. These taxes on various commodities and services (mostly necessities) are, of course, passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. It means that those who can least afford to pay them will bear the overwhelming burden of these new taxes. It also means that at the same time that the government is supposed to be taking action to prevent rising prices, it introduces a tax bill which must result in higher prices! However, we should not expect logic from capitalist politicians.
Some of the increases in existing excise taxes as well as some of the new excise taxes are as follows: distilled spirits, an increase of $1.00 a gallon to yield $122,300,000; wines, increased rates to yield $5,000,000; automobiles, tax increased from 3½ to 7 per cent, to yield $74,900,000; tires and tubes, increased rates to yield $44,600,000; matches, a tax of 2 cents per 1,000, to yield $21,000,000; playing cards, rate increased from 11 to 13 cents, to yield $1,000,000; radios and receiving sets, rate increased from 5½ to 10 per cent, to yield $9,400,000; telephone bills, a tax of 5 per cent, to yield $43,600.000; transportation of persons, which excludes tickets for 30 days or less, a tax of 5 per cent, to yield $36,500,000; a “use” tax on automobiles, yachts and airplanes of $5.00 each per year, to yield $180,200,000 (imagine placing yachts and airplanes in the same class as second-hand automobiles!); bowling alley, pool or billiard table tax, $15 each, to yield $3,400.000; soft drinks, a tax of one-sixth cent per bottle or its equivalent, to yield $22,600,000; also a 10 per cent tax on the following items: phonographs and records, musical instruments, sporting goods, luggage, electrical appliances, photographic apparatus, electric signs, business and store machines, rubber articles, washing machines for commercial laundries, jewelry, furs and toilet preparations.
For those making under $2,000 a year – that is, 70 per cent of the nation – these excise taxes alone (not counting the state taxes and “voluntary” contributions of various types) will mean a greater increase in their already high taxes than is the case with the wealthy. The writing of a real tax bill – one which would raise the money from those who can afford it by a capital levy on all those with incomes over $10,000 a year – that, of course, is too much to expect from those docile representatives of big business in Congress. But we should at least expect the honorable congressmen to read their own tax bill – even if they don’t debate it. That is most unlikely since only three days have been allowed to consider a bill which is 95 pages in length!
Thus does the Congress, by its very actions, reveal the fakery and hypocrisy which is involved in every tax bill.
 



In response to the-growing dissatisfaction with the tremendous amount of profiteering that is taking place under the “defense” program, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., precipitated one of the bitterest economic controversies ever touched off by the Roosevelt Administration when he proposed that the .government take all profits over 6 per cent of the capital invested. The eminent Secretary was testifying in favor of price control as the only alternative to inflation. The bombshell was let loose in response to a question from a reporter about controlling the present rise in prices. Immediately a storm arose on Capitol Hill and in the boss press about the “radical” Morgenthau trying to “carry out the New Deal program for the establishment of socialism” and “the destruction of private initiative.” Both the proposal and the response are extremely interesting and deserve the careful attention of the workers. Morgenthau was very careful to dress his proposal up as an additional measure to prevent inflation. He did not dare to mention the super-colossal profiteering going on now in all branches of industry and business. But there is no doubt that the chief motivation for the 6 per cent profit limitation is the widespread feeling that there is something slightly unethical, to say the least, when the big corporations are raking in the dough so fast that they can’t count it. It strikes the masses of the population as something: less than 100 per cent patriotism when the bosses are making from 100 to 400 per cent profit in many cases – during a period officially proclaimed as a “national emergency.” This is bad for the morale of the people. It leaves the workers and the soldiers feeling very disgruntled. The common man begins to feel that he is holding the bag, so to speak, while the bosses empty it – which is as good a description of the present situation as any. Such a situation breeds strikes and unrest. Worst of all, it sharpens class antagonisms. The best way, from the point of view of the bosses, is to PRETEND to impose sacrifices on the bosses.
 
We’re From Missouri
We welcome the idea of a 100 per cent excess profits tax. This is an essential first step in the direction of elementary social justice. Yet I hope that our readers will forgive us if we introduce a slightly skeptical note.
In the first place, “we’re from Missouri.” We don’t believe the bosses will tolerate a 6 per cent limit on their profits – even on paper. Already, it is indicated that the government will have to “compromise” if it wants to get any bill passed which limits profits. The nature of such a “compromise” measure is not hard to guess. It will still permit the bosses to coin fabulous profits. A meaningless gesture to appease the outraged sentiment of the workers is all that can be expected from a boss government, dominated by “dollar-a-year” men. If the bosses refused to produce during the first period of the “defense” program until the Vinson-Trammell Act, limiting profits on naval order to 8 per cent, was repealed; if they virtually went on a “sit-down” strike until they got a fake excess profits bill passed, coupled with a very liberal amortization clause that allows them to write off the cost of new plants in five years instead of the customary 20 years – there doesn’t seem to be any reason for believing that the big capitalists will sit idly by and watch the government reduce their profits to a “starvation” minimum.
But, since the age of miracles has not yet passed and this war is a very serious business, let us suppose that the government gets a 6 per cent profit limitation bill passed. This brings us to the second reason for our skepticism. Profits can be concealed, with or without the connivance of the Treasury’s tax experts, so that what appears to be a 6 per cent profit away well turn out to be 60 or 100 per cent or more. The International Federation of Trade Unions, for example, reports that even in Germany, with a 6 per cent limit on profits, supposedly enforced by a powerful and ruthless government, the big capitalists are able to conceal fantastic profits under the legal 6 per cent clause.
One of the favorite tricks is to “water the stock.” In this favorite dodge of the big bosses, the Americans don’t have anything to learn from the Germans. The aircraft companies, among many others, are excellent examples of this technique. Let us say that a corporation has raised $10,000,000 through issuing common stock. Six per cent on this capital invested would mean that the most that could be paid out in dividends is $600,000. Now let us suppose this stock is “watered.” That is, more stock is issued than the corporation is worth. What happens? Just this – if, for example, twice the amount of stock is issued (and it only requires a “vote” of the stockholders to authorize such a maneuver), then the corporation presumably has a capital of $20,000,000. Six per cent on this amount would mean double the profit, or $1,200,000. There is practically no limit to the extent to which this profit-concealing device can be used.
And if they get tired of using this method of concealing profits, there are many others that the bosses can use and are using every day. One of the favorites is to pay out huge salaries and bonuses to the officers (for their hard work in concealing profits, of course). Such items become part of the costs of manufacturing, according to capitalist bookkeeping methods. They are, is reality, profits.
 
What Shall We Do?
There are many other methods that the bosses use to conceal their profits. Corporation lawyers are paid fancy salaries for precisely this reason and we are sure that with the incentive for concealing profits increased by a profit-limitation bill, the corporation lawyers will work overtime to find new methods to conceal profits. As long as the bosses control the economic set-up, any profit-limitation can only be a paper one.
If the government is serious in its desire to control and limit profits, then let the workers examine the books of the bosses. Only the workers know the real situation in their own factories. Only the workers can make sure that the profits of the bosses are really limited. The workers, however, will never get this right from the bosses or from the boss government. They must fight for it, make it one of their demands on the picket line. This, and only this, is the way to limit profits.
