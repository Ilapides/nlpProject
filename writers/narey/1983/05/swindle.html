<p class="fst"><strong>THE ENGINEERING industry in Bradford district came to a standstill for one hour on 19 May, in support of 45 workers sacked by Hindles engineering company.</strong></p>

<p>Hundreds of workers turned up to a solidarity rally at the factory gate.</p>

<p>Both Hindle and the Engineering Employers Federation, confident of victory, chose to make an example of this small group of workers in dispute over a pay claim, but the plan backfired.</p>

<p>Since 13 March, a constant picket has been maintained.</p>

<p>Ray Andrews, AUEW Divisional Secretary, explained to the rally:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;... this dispute has been deliberately and carefully planned, not just by Hindle but by the Engineering Employers Federation.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;Over the years we have made concessions to the bosses but now they&rsquo;re trying to screw us into the ground. We can&rsquo;t afford to lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">In the words of Henry Wilkinson, Regional Officer, &ldquo;A district of this size can beat a company the size of Hindles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pat Wall, Labour candidate, Bradford North, addressed the rally on behalf of Bradford Trades Council.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;This company should be called Swindles not Hindles. What we&rsquo;re talking about here is not a group of striking militants but a small group of ordinary decent workers who went through the normal industrial procedure over a just pay claim. Because they dared to disagree with the dictates of the boss they&rsquo;ve been flung on to the dole.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;The bosses are using the fact we have 30,000 unemployed in Bradford to intimidate and threaten workers. &lsquo;Either accept our orders or you&rsquo;re out, and we&rsquo;ll give your jobs to someone else.&rsquo; This struggle is not just one for trade union rights but one against blackmail, not just an industrial struggle but also a political one.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;These dismissal notices were issued with the full backing of the Tory government thanks to Tebbit&rsquo;s legislation. We must stand firm, we must win, you have my full support and that of the Trades Council.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The rally ended with a suggestion by chairman Peter Walker that the workers shouldn&rsquo;t dash off but wait to say &ldquo;how do&rdquo; to the scabs still at work!</p>
