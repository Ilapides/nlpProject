<p class="fst">WORKERS AT the Carter Gear Works, Bradford, part of the Renold
combine, walked out a week last Tuesday in protest at staff defying
overtime bans.</p>

<p>A claim was made for a &#163;10 increase in May this year. Management
refused to offer any money and said instead that a new incentive
scheme was being proposed. This scheme would have meant cuts in wages
of up to 25% per week.</p>

<p>The overtime ban was imposed over the question of the wages, it
being decided to keep this low key, understanding that the main
battle would be against the new so-called incentive proposals.</p>

<p>Management gave an undertaking that the overtime would not be
breached over the weekend by staff doing the work of hourly paid
employees. However, on Saturday morning, one staff member came in and
was instructed to do some fitting work.</p>

<p>When the workers found out on Monday morning, management said that
it was a mistake, and would not happen again. However, a mass meeting
of the workers refused to believe the management, and a motion from
the shop floor for an immediate one-day walk out was carried
unanimously. It was decided to return to work on the following day,
and to use this action as a shot across the bows of the management,
but any further breaches of the overtime ban would have similar consequences.</p>
