<p class="fst">Conference meets at a time when Thatcher&#8217;s reactionary Tory
government is threatening the right to picket, the right to a closed
shop, and for some workers even the right to strike.</p>
<p>The recent case involving the Dyers and Bleachers and Joe Thompson
has been used by the Tories and their friends in the press as an
example of the evils of trade unionism and particularly the closed shop.</p>
<p>The silence of the union leadership, who passed responsibility to
the TUC, has only given encouragement to the Tory MPs who are backing Thompson.</p>
<p>The membership have a right to a clear explanation. <em>The
decision to restore Thompson&#8217;s union card goes against the decision
of the conference in 1976 not to lift the blacking of Denby&#8217;s.</em></p>
<p><em>The executive have a clear duty to carry out conference
decisions, not refer them to other bodies for action.</em></p>
<p>The Dyers and Bleachers have one of the longest and proudest
democratic traditions of trade unions anywhere.</p>
<p>It was they who won the fight for the nine-hour day in Bradford
nearly one hundred years ago, as well as securing a minimum wage and
establishing the practice of union control over the employment of new labour.</p>
<p>All the improvements in conditions, however, do not compensate for
the scandalously low wage levels in the industry or the long hours of
overtime and anti-social shifts.</p>
<p>In unison with the rest of the labour and trade union movement,
the union will have to fight to defend the gains of the past, and to
challenge the threatened redundancies.</p>
<p>The incoming General Secretary, Bill Maddocks, is regarded as a
militant trade unionist and socialist.</p>
<p>If we are to be successful in the coming struggles with the
employers, backed by the Tory government, the entire membership will
need to rally around a fighting leadership.</p>
