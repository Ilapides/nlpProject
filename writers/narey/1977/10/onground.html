<p class="fst">One of the hardest things about coming to university is the
unreality of the environment.</p>
<p>While outside storms rage about wages and conditions, inflation
and unemployment, inside these well-upholstered walls, beautiful
thoughts are mounted into high sounding concepts and academic debate
replaces class conflict.</p>
<p>Under the evasive, ambiguous leadership of the Broad Left at the
head of the NUS, student politics seem vague, disconnected and
irrelevant.</p>
<p>It is therefore easy to become bemused and retreat to study, or
seek refuge in beer, sport or whatever else is going on.</p>
<p>Among the confusion and apathy, the Labour Clubs stand out like
beacons of light, attracting the disoriented students and guiding
them back towards reality.</p>
<p>Starting with an honest, down-to-earth attitude to the political
problems of the day, inviting open, free debate with all sections of
the labour movement, they can draw serious students into political
activity and direct them towards the local Labour Party, and in
particular the Labour Party Young Socialists. This contrasts sharply
with the impetuous, off-putting approach of some student groups on
the left.</p>
<p>Through the labour movement students can play a part in the
various campaigns, especially the Youth Campaign Against Unemployment.</p>
<p>The respect and influence the LYPS has in the labour movement will
ensure the student a welcome among the local activists.</p>
<p>Here are tremendous lessons to be learnt, of the necessity for
organisation, control over the leadership by the rank and file, and
unity of all workers.</p>
<p>Students have more to learn from workers than to teach. Yet the
students, with their energy, idealism and time to read and interpret,
have a tremendous amount to contribute to the organised labour
movement, provided they are prepared to take their share of the hard,
routine work. Involvement in the Labour Party keeps a student&#8217;s
feet on the ground.</p>
