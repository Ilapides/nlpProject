<p class="fst"><em>Labour&#8217;s landslide victory at the general election was
tainted by the accidental death the following day of lifelong
activist Keith Narey. A long-time member of the far-left Militant
Tendency, he nevertheless had friends from across the political
spectrum. He was, in the end, an old-fashioned, tub-thumping
socialist, and his death marked the passing of a generation of
campaigners who fought tooth and nail to shape Britain&#8217;s
post-war politics. By <strong>Andy Beckett</strong></em></p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />

<p class="fst">The night in May after the general election, Keith Narey was so
happy he fell over a wall. It was just tall enough to catch him:
about knee height, smooth with new bricks, topped by a sharp red
ridge that ran its entire length beside the path to his front door.
He did not need much help in falling. He was thickly drunk &#8211;
thrilled to be drunk, in fact, his head roaring with beer and
after-hours whiskies and cheers to the Labour victory.</p>
<p>He tripped quickly. Though 50, Narey was not a heavy man; but as
the wall lurched towards him, and its ridge jabbed into his right
knee, his momentum and his big talker&#8217;s head and his beginning of a
belly cast him firmly forward. The grey paving rushed up from the
darkness.</p>
<p>Narey almost saved himself with his arms. As he fell, his right
shoulder glanced off the wall, and his knee was bruising, but the
rest of him thudded unscathed to the concrete. Except that he began
to vomit, his stomach rebelling at the jarring, and as he lay,
surprised and winded and suddenly unconscious, he breathed it in. He
began to die.</p>
<p>He was being watched: nearby, high on the side of his tower block,
a security camera perched. Bradford City Council had positioned it
there to stare protectively down at the estate&#8217;s tenants and their
visitors, and record them. Around 12.15 that night, the camera caught
Narey&#8217;s stagger and fall, and fed it back &#8211; a small, flailing
blur &#8211; to one of four screens in the security office. Each screen
was split seven ways, one grainy postcard for each camera on the
estate; a single security guard, marooned out of sight in another
tower block up the hill, watched them all.</p>
<p>About 25 minutes after Narey fell, the guard phoned the police. He
did not call an ambulance. Sixty-five minutes after that, a van of
officers arrived &#8211; they only came to this estate in numbers &#8211; and
quickly found Narey, beached behind the wall. The police&#8217;s
telephone operator had just speculated that he &#8220;had fallen asleep
under the stars&#8221;. But Narey had been dead for quite a while.</p>
<p>It seemed a parochial tragedy. &#8220;Man found dead after election
celebration,&#8221; as the <strong>Bradford Telegraph and Argus</strong> first
reported. It was a cautionary tale: or, at most, a dab of sourness in
the great, sweet stew of public happiness since the election. It
meant rather more to Narey&#8217;s family and friends, of course &#8211; and
their sadness was stiffened with anger, which seemed justified, at
the way he had been left to choke &#8211; yet all that was for the
inquest to come and, afterwards perhaps, for local recriminations
against the council and police. Men had died neglected on estates before.</p>
<p>Not many of them, however, have had a funeral like Keith Narey&#8217;s.
The crematorium chapel became so crammed that the crowd burst into
the room next door. In turn, that grew so squeezed that it spilled
eager mourners out into the cemetery. The whole city seemed in these
three places: as a jazz band parped away, and the literary agents
circled around Narey&#8217;s brother Brian, there stood Bradford&#8217;s Lord
Mayor and it&#8217;s Labour MPs, its besieged Conservative councillors
and entrenched union leaders, its keen new Liberal Democrats and City
Hall veterans, socialists still. The surprise was red in their faces:
that Narey was abruptly dead, but also for many of them, so opposed
for so long, in so many curt West Yorkshire ways, were all there together.</p>
<p>Narey was on benefits when he died. He lived alone. Yet after his
funeral, his commemoration echoed on: his ashes would be contested in
an annual cricket match; there would be a memorial stone near his
flat; a kind of shrine, with glass front and side lighting, in the
wall of his favourite pub. And this all began to spread beyond a
local matter. Narey&#8217;s death was mentioned on Radio 4&#8217;s <em>Today</em>
programme and on Radio 5 and at length in the <strong>London Evening
Standard</strong>, usually less than concerned with events in the Pennines.</p>
<p>Each of these tributes recorded one particular thing about Keith
Narey: he had been a member of the extreme left Militant Tendency. In
fact, he had been rather more than that. During the late Seventies
and throughout the Eighties, Bradford, after Liverpool, was
Militant&#8217;s second city. And Narey was the movements&#8217;s heart and
lungs there: organising, energising, fundraising and frightening
councillors, securing the election of a Militant MP. Twice he
battered his way past the Labour establishment to be nominated for
office in City Hall; twice he was blocked by the party&#8217;s National
Executive Committee (NEC). Neil Kinnock personally had him investigated.</p>
<p>Yet this alone cannot explain Narey&#8217;s funeral, with its rude
fondness for every political quarter, or its wider aftermath. Nor, in
its broadest context, his death: why was this Militant, unrepentant
and scornful of New Labour, so thrilled at the final victory of his
party enemies? The answers are in his life, and in the grand ruin of
a city he lived it in.</p>
<p>Bradford, in its broken saucer of hills, was where the Independent
Labour Party (ILP) was founded in 1893. The history of this gusty
place since then is, in its way, the history of British socialism. In
the 1890s, Bradford was already the quintessential Victorian
industrial city: close-packed, tumbling with terraces, brutal in its
economics. And for the next 80 years, as the thick-walled textile
mills clanked away, their chimneys like fortress towers on the high
ground, the ILP &#8211; and the unions and the Labour Party it helped to
lead to &#8211; strove to alleviate that brutality.</p>
<p>Then, in the Seventies and Eighties, the mills began to empty and
quieten. Dead land opened up in the city centre with buddleia growing
instead of jobs; and Bradford&#8217;s socialists and self-helpers and
self-appointed saviours had to struggle all the harder. In the
litter-strewn city, with its racial tensions and its Yorkshire Ripper
and its terrible fire at its ancient football stadium &#8211; the city
taken, this time, as Britain&#8217;s emblem of fraught, post-industrial
decline &#8211; Keith Narey was the noisiest activist, the most
controversial, the most liked.</p>
<p>At his funeral, some sensed more than his passing. A Labour Party
far to the right of Neil Kinnock&#8217;s was in government now.
Socialism, like Militant, seemed to be slipping back, ever faster,
into distant history. But Narey, for all the dramas of his political
career, for all his dogmatic beliefs, did not live only to defend and
symbolise a fading faith. He joined Militant in his late 20s, and
effectively left it seven years before his death. These early and
late parts of his life were as different from street-corner
Trotskyism as it is possible to imagine. The West-Yorkshire
rabble-rouser had already been, variously, a west-London bohemian, a
would-be Beatnik and a world-girdling hippie traveller. After
Militant, he wrote plays and fought causes without a banner in sight.
Narey&#8217;s funeral guests knew him only in fragments.</p>
<p>Keith Anthony Narey was born in Bradford in January 1947. His
family were Catholics from Sligo in the west of Ireland, who had come
to Yorkshire to sweat in the mills at the end of the 19th century.
Narey&#8217;s father was a monumental mason, his mother swept factory
floors. They lived on the Canterbury Estate, south of the centre of
Bradford, in a maze of council brick. When residents went away on
holiday, they took their gas meters with them for safe-keeping.</p>
<p>Narey was one of five children. His father read Jack London, and
remembered the Thirties as an era of great socialist struggle. Narey
absorbed these enthusiasms &#8211; not so much for their content as for
the wider horizons of thought and deed they suggested. He studied
hard enough at school to pass the 11-plus, and became a rare
Canterbury boy at the local grammar. Rarer still, he was reading Jack Kerouac.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1963, aged 16, Narey disappeared to Yugoslavia.
For the next three months, he picked through the rubble of the Skopje
earthquake as a relief worker. When he came back to West Yorkshire,
he had a purpose &#8211; to earn the money to get away again. This was a
common enough instinct in the Narey family: &#8220;We&#8217;re always off to
the next port of call,&#8221; says Brian Narey, Keith&#8217;s elder brother.
And Brian, who was eight years older but close to Keith in more than
appearance &#8211; both were thin and almost tall, with thick bearskins
of hair &#8211; already personified the price of staying put. He was
working in the mills.</p>
<p>Keith chose a different routine. For the first few months of the
year, he took jobs in shops and offices in Bradford. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t
right fond of hard manual graft,&#8221; says Brian. In the summer, Keith
and Brian shipped off to the Isle of Man to make cocktails in hotel
bars. And at the end of August, when Brian went back to the mill,
Keith went to Kathmandu and India. Narey was intoxicated, appalled
and drawn back to the subcontinent, and in 1965 he applied for
Voluntary Service Overseas. He spent the year in Bihar, north-east
India, teaching children history and, more convincingly, football. At
the end, he was given a pound of cannabis. Narey carried it through Gatwick.</p>
<p>At 20, Keith moved with Brian to London. By now, he had grown into
someone rather different. &#8220;We&#8217;d go to Petticoat Lane, and he&#8217;d
wear a blue mac, blue denim shirt and blue knitted tie,&#8221; says
Brian. &#8220;I&#8217;d say, &#8216;Why&#8217;s everyone calling you guv?&#8217; Then the
penny dropped: they thought he was the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was 1967, and London seemed an infinite stage for the likes of
Narey. The two brothers went to see Mannfred Mann and the Rolling
Stones; they lived in Notting Hill with the head of the British
Witches as their landlord (&#8220;Keith tried that stuff out,&#8221; says
Brian); and Keith , on his own this time, brassed his way into a
certain pub called <em>The Blind Beggar</em>. The Kray&#8217;s milieu
didn&#8217;t bother him: &#8220;The challenge,&#8221; says Brian, &#8220;was to go
somewhere he wasn&#8217;t known and strike up a conversation.&#8221; And
Keith Narey could do that. His voice seemed flat Bradford at first,
but it had a cheeky curl to its &#8220;r&#8221;s. Deadpan, Narey could say
things directly that others didn&#8217;t dare; after a few drinks &#8211; and
he rarely bought them &#8211; he could take over the bar with his
put-downs. He stayed in London for more than a year.</p>
<p>By the end of the Sixties, Narey knew how to get almost anywhere.
He could be forward in French, Spanish, German and Italian. He knew
his Greek poetry and the work of Allen Ginsberg. He decided he would
be a writer. His bohemian American heroes were the obvious models,
writing what they had seen and lived, and seeing and living with that
end in mind. In 1972, he flew to Calcutta to become a beggar. On good
days, he earned enough for a bowl of rice. Narey lasted into 1973
among the lepers and the beds in boxes, then developed jaundice and
yellow fever. He had no money, and had lost his passport; the Indian
Government had to fly him home. Convalescing in Bradford, Narey had
the material he wanted, and he was already writing &#8211; vivid,
untutored unspoolings of his travels and speculations &#8211; but the
experience of begging had stung him. Narey joined a union.</p>
<p>He was working as a council keeper in Lister Park, the city&#8217;s
stately triangle of Victorian planting that sloped down from the
great, grand mill complex of the same name. In 1973, the council
decided to &#8220;rationalise&#8221; its parks workforce. A union meeting was
called at Bradford&#8217;s central library.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw him on the back of a lorry, heading down,&#8221; remembers
Allan Brack, then a fellow union member. At the meeting, Narey spoke,
less than clearly, in a very loud voice. That night, Brack took him
to a meeting of the Bradford West Labour Party and signed him up.
Narey joined the local trades council too, but here a realisation
rapidly occurred to him about Bradford&#8217;s ruling Labour
establishment. It was dominated by cautious unions such as the
transport workers&#8217; and, despite the decades of post-war Asian
immigration to the city, overwhelmingly white. Narey&#8217;s excited
notion of socialism was not to be satisfied here.</p>
<p>There was, however, another Left at work in the city. Allan Brack
was a member of Militant. The group had started as a Trotskyist
micro-faction in 1964; by the early Seventies, Militant&#8217;s
membership was still in the hundreds. But it had momentum: as Edward
Heath&#8217;s government wobbled, and picket lines seemed to wrap the
country, Militant&#8217;s apocalyptic predictions about workers battling
bosses grew persuasive. In 1974, a new, more confident strategy was
unfurled from headquarters in London: &#8220;We must dig roots in the
wards and constituencies ... Many are still shells dominated by
politically dead old men and women.&#8221; Bradford looked a good target.</p>
<p>Militant&#8217;s main tactic was infiltration, or &#8220;entryism&#8221;:
members were to join Labour Party organisations and take unofficial
control of them. The political life Narey had chosen was hard &#8211; a
ceaseless round of canvassing and weekend conferences and
paper-selling on raw Pennine afternoons &#8211; and made doubly so by the
need to live for two masters, officially for the Labour Party and,
more surreptitiously, for his true cause.</p>
<p>Yet Narey was good at it. On voters&#8217; doorsteps, he was easy and
natural, just striking up another conversation with a stranger.
Selling papers was the same: every Saturday morning, at the bottom of
Bradford&#8217;s main shopping street, lightening his bundle by asides
and nerveless button-holing. People soon knew his anorak.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">Narey made more eccentric contributions too. He organised a
Yorkshire pudding-eating contest to raise money. &#8220;He was unusual in
Militant circles,&#8221; says Tim Moon, now a DJ on Bradford&#8217;s
community radio station, then a Militant too. &#8220;The real world
didn&#8217;t touch a lot of those people, but Keith wasn&#8217;t always in
meetings.&#8221; Quite a lot of the time, in fact, Narey was in the pub.
He wasn&#8217;t a big drinker &#8211; three pints usually carried the evening
&#8211; but he knew his ales. He became the first Bradford chairman of
the Campaign For Real Ale (Camra), using good beer as a battering ram
against the local brewers. This was more than a happy convergence of
his appetites and politics, however. At Camra meetings, he had to
persuade and befriend members who were mainstream Labour men,
Liberals, Conservatives, even. Despite his new, dogmatic politics,
Narey kept his pragmatist&#8217;s twinkle; it would serve him beyond Militant.</p>
<p>In Bradford in 1974, though, confrontation was more their norm.
The issue Militant hoped to mobilise around was race. Immigrants had
been arriving in the city for a century &#8211; Irish, Poles and Germans
&#8211; but many of Bradford&#8217;s white residents remained far from
reconciled to incomers of more obviously different skin tones and
customs. On the steep streets of the Asian inner city, the National
Front was at work. Militant saw this as an outrage, and an
opportunity to win Asian allies. Narey and Allan Brack and the
president of the trades council, another Militant called Pat Wall,
attended an anti-racism conference in Birmingham, organised by the
TUC. The National Front was planning to march in Bradford; Narey and
his colleagues were instructed to march against them.</p>
<p>In Birmingham, the Bradford Militants had met a young Indian
communist called Raghvir Virdee. He had settled in Bradford, and been
disappointed by the Labour Party&#8217;s racial make-up. Narey, however,
impressed him: &#8220;He was a natural commander.&#8221; Virdee joined
Militant. On the day of the march, he walked alongside his new
comrades, and trades unionists, and families with pushchairs, along
Manningham Lane, the wide and straight main road that rises through
the middle of Asian Bradford. Narey strode along, carrying an ancient
union banner brought out for the occasion. The National Front&#8217;s
supporters boiled alongside. As the march was passing the trades
council building, the National Front attacked him.</p>
<p>Narey was beaten with knotted tree branches. Brack was assaulted
too, the banner thrown on the road, urinated on and burnt. Gary
Armitage, another Militant member on the march, saw it happen: &#8220;All
Keith said was, &#8216;The problem is the banner is battered.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Narey, and Bradford Militant, had made their public statement. In
the north of the city in particular, recruiting strengthened. But
Narey was still a park keeper; he was tired of the rest of his life.
In 1975, he decided to go to university. That year, Bradford
University was starting a new course, the first in the country, in
peace studies. A hundred students would examine economics and
politics and internationals relations, not in the traditional way,
but as areas of struggle for ordinary people. The students could
range about and read almost what they wanted. Narey could not have
invented a better degree himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had the sense of a person who was genuinely trying to keep
his mind open,&#8221; says Tom Woodhouse, a senior peace studies lecturer
at Bradford, who taught Narey from 1975 to 1978. The new department,
although politically neutral, was noisy with internal debates. Narey
was &#8220;always at the forefront of things ... very good on his feet.&#8221;
His thesis, which came with less facility, was about the birth of the
Labour Party in Bradford&#8217;s Victorian textile trade. Narey was
learning his own family&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>At the same time, he was trying to change it. The Monday before he
graduated, Keith was interviewed on <em>Panorama</em> as a major
Militant activist. The same television presenter welcomed Narey
onstage for his graduation. Narey made a weak joke of it, but
Militant was about to absorb him much further. In 1978, he became a
paid-up Militant &#8220;full-timer&#8221;.</p>
<p>As the Callaghan government disintegrated, Militant members were
winning council seats in Labour colours. In West Yorkshire, Pat Wall
and Gary Armitage were both elected. They gave Narey direct points of
influence: &#8220;He&#8217;d come to me,&#8221; says Armitage, &#8220;and say,
&#8216;Number 39 down the street needs their trees cutting. I&#8217;ve
guaranteed that you&#8217;ll see to it.&#8217;&#8221; But Narey and his
colleagues wanted a Bradford Militant MP. In 1981, the Bradford North
Labour Party, now busy with Militant members, dropped the
constituency&#8217;s MP, a right-wing Labour man called Ben Ford, in
favour of Pat Wall as its candidate at the next general election.
Narey began running Wall&#8217;s campaign.</p>
<p>Like Narey, Wall was a fierce speaker, fond of jazz and a pint.
Unlike Narey, he had been in Militant from the beginning. Narey
admired him, worked endless hours for him, and regularly visited the
Wall family home. Then, in 1982, Narey&#8217;s boss became infamous. The
<strong>Sunday Times</strong> secretly taped Wall debating against the
Socialist Workers&#8217; Party (SWP); at one point, he laid out what a
Militant government might mean: &#8220;The abolition of the monarchy, the
House of Lords, the sacking of the generals, the admirals, the air
marshal, the senior civil servants ... and people of that character
... We [Militant] will face bloodshed. We will face the possibility
of civil war ...&#8221;</p>
<p>No matter that Wall had been warning of, not welcoming, national
unrest; soon Wall and Narey were being filmed as they ate their
cornflakes. And their notoriety, while good for national publicity,
was less appealing to Bradford&#8217;s more conservative Labour voters.
For the 1983 general election, Ben Ford put himself forward as an
Independent Labour candidate and drew away 4,000 votes. Wall lost to
the Conservatives by 1,600.</p>
<p>Militant&#8217;s enemies could celebrate: the faction and its
fanatics, it could be imagined, would retreat back into their rooms
in pub, their lonely paper-selling, their back-burner domestic lives.
Narey, at 36, was still sharing a messy house with a bunch of
students. But order at home, like easy political victories, had never
been his priority or expectation. Narey lived for different rewards.</p>
<p>They came most easily, perhaps, in the <em>Jacob&#8217;s Well</em>, a
small, whitewashed pub marooned between the Leeds Road and a
roundabout. On the outside, it was just an old inn with a few picnic
tables, greying steadily. Yet inside, in the gloom, was all the
city&#8217;s political life. Saturday afternoon was a good time, after
the Militants had sold all their papers, or their fingers and toes
had grown too cold, and they had come in for a drink and a row with
the SWP. Evenings during the week were good too: City Hall was just
across the road, spiked with Victorian spires and perennial
intrigues, and councillors got thirsty. The <em>Jacob&#8217;s Well</em> had
good beer, board games and dark panelling. Narey, in his own mind at
least, was the ruler of this low-ceilinged kingdom. And, over time &#8211;
time when, outside the <em>Jacob&#8217;s Well</em>, Militant was fighting
the sourest battles &#8211; Narey&#8217;s bar quirks had a serious bearing on
his reputation. Here was the Trotskyist, the sectarian, who would
have a drink with anyone. &#8220;Keith was never part of the macho
Militant culture,&#8221; says Jeanette Sunderland, a Liberal Democrat
councillor. As Narey put it, &#8220;You don&#8217;t allow political
differences to interfere in your relations with people. We&#8217;re all
human, we eat, we bleed.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Narey needed to eat, he would go round to Raghvir Virdee&#8217;s.
&#8220;He would knock any time,&#8221; says Virdee, &#8220;And say: &#8216;Raghvir!
What have you got in the fridge?&#8217; My wife used to cook for him ...
He was part of the family.&#8221; Women liked Narey, too: invited first
to parties, propping up someone&#8217;s fireplace with a beer, eyes
flocking around beneath his fringe. But nothing lasting seemed to
come of it; long term, Narey appeared attached only to the struggle.</p>
<p>Beyond Bradford, Militant had done well in the 1983 elections. It
gained its first two MPs, Dave Nellist and Terry Fields, when most of
the country was moving to the right. Both men retained their
popularity; in the mid-Eighties, with the Labour Party becalmed in
the polls despite its nascent &#8220;modernisation&#8221;, a return to
fundamentalist socialism had its appeal. In Bradford, as in most
cities, the beggars were living in boxes now, just as they had in
Narey&#8217;s Calcutta. Pat Wall put himself forward for Bradford North
again. There was only one problem: at party headquarters in London,
they had noticed what Militant was up to.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">By 1986, the Labour leadership&#8217;s view of Militant had darkened:
the irrelevancy of the Seventies and the irritant of the early
Eighties had become the irreconcilable enemy within. In Liverpool,
Derek Hatton led a council in open conflict with Neil Kinnock. In
Bradford, at this point, the reprimands from headquarters were milder
&#8211; Liverpool was enough to deal with &#8211; but they were growing. In
the spring, the NEC halted Wall&#8217;s candidacy and examined his
selection. Wall survived. With Narey commanding his Militant cadre
again, Wall won at the 1987 election by almost the same margin that
he had lost by in 1983.</p>
<p>But Wall was not the NEC&#8217;s real target. To secure its approval,
he had stopped appearing on Militant platforms or writing for its
newspaper; once elected, he joined Labour&#8217;s respectable Left. The
unrepentant Narey made a better target. In August 1987, a regional
party inquiry began, then a national investigation. In December, it
reported: Militant, it claimed, had set up its own parallel party
apparatus in Bradford North, complete with a separate headquarters.
The Bradford North Labour Party was suspended.</p>
<p>Narey was thrilled at the prospect of battle. In January 1988, as
the NEC met to consider his expulsion from the party, Narey decided
to stand for the council. Challenging the city&#8217;s chairman of
education, John Ryan, he won selection by a single vote. Ryan accused
Militant of intimidating local members and, almost immediately, the
NEC declared &#8220;procedural irregularities&#8221;; Narey&#8217;s candidacy was
vetoed. He picked another ward and stood again. In March, he was once
more, again by a single vote against a council grandee, this time
Marilyn Beeley, the wife of the city&#8217;s Labour leader.</p>
<p>To Labour&#8217;s national hierarchy, Narey at his apogee was beyond
infuriating. His disloyal antics with the &#8220;Bradford North Seven&#8221;,
as the Militants were excited to be known, threatened the loss of the
council. Meanwhile, Narey gave great, mocking interviews: &#8220;if Neil
Kinnock and Roy Hattersley have got a strategy for achieving
socialism,&#8221; he would say, &#8220;they are keeping it bloody quiet.&#8221;
Even the allegations of Militant bullying would not stick to him:
&#8220;Violence is an admission of failure,&#8221; Narey would reply without a blink.</p>
<p>Then, quite quickly, it was all over. By 22 votes to four, the NEC
barred him from standing for the council. Narey threatened a High
Court challenge; it never came. In May 1988, the Conservatives took
control of Bradford on the mayor&#8217;s casting vote. And in September
1989, barely two years since his boss&#8217;s triumph, Narey was expelled
from the Labour Party. He had been waiting for it: he had booked a
bar to mark the occasion. That night, Narey held court attached to a
plastic ball and chain. But his life&#8217;s main channel had been
blocked. A year later, the blockage became permanent: Pat Wall died,
aged 57. &#8220;It put the light out of Keith&#8217;s life,&#8221; says Brian Narey.</p>
<p>This time, Narey did retreat. During his selection struggles, he
had already moved away from the middle of Bradford, to an isolated
northern suburb called Idle. Here, on the far slope of a tall hill,
facing away from City Hall and towards the forest-green depths of the
Aire Valley, he had set up a quieter kingdom. Narey had his own flat
now, with two bedrooms, on the fifth floor of a beige brick tower
block at the centre of the Thorpe Edge estate. He had made the second
bedroom a study and filled it with books: Marx and Trotsky, of
course, but a Thomas Hardy collection too, and Oscar Wilde and Paul
Theroux, and C.P. Cafavy, the Alexandrian Greek poet. Then there was
the kitchen, Narey kept it clean, unusually for him, and cooked
pheasant in brandy, and bacon and eggs with the same knowingness. He
marinaded, he drank port, he listened to his folk records &#8211; and not
always alone: Brian came round for supper, and there was Kirsty
MacLean. Narey had had his girlfriends, but Kirsty was allowed to
move into his dusty lair. She stayed.</p>
<p>Narey did not miss the city too much. He had the moors above
Thorpe Edge and the bluebell woods below, and would walk off into
them for hours in his leather jacket and unsuitable shoes. He would
go to Scotland to sight a rare bird. And he had a new pub.</p>
<p>The <em>Brewery Tap</em> was small, dark and careful with its ales.
Narey began working behind the bar three evenings a week. Sunday
nights drew him too: his quiz team, Academic Ali, always won &#8211;
Narey&#8217;s reading and real-world wanderings overwhelmed a pub full of
rugby league fans. And on summer afternoons, there was the cricket.
The <em>Brewery Tap</em> played Camra, and Narey umpired.</p>
<p>Yet he was barely 40; he couldn&#8217;t just retire with his
anecdotes. From the toppling paper stacks in his flat, he pulled out
his old manuscripts. During 1990, he wrote a play. <em>Union Man</em>
was not Chekhov; it was autobiography and family history, tersely
bolted together, presented as the story of a politicised and
victimised textile worker called Alan McCarthy. But Narey wanted it
performed. A professional company took up the play, then collapsed
for lack of cash, so in 1991 he set up his own, the <em>Phoenix
Theatre Group</em>. Narey got his friends to stand in for actors. Then
he turned director.</p>
<p>It worked. Narey&#8217;s cast, in truth, had no more need to act than
he had to make things up: he and they &#8211; old Militant comrades, his
brother Brian, local trades unionists &#8211; shared the same language
and world-view. Surprisingly, other people wanted to hear it. During
1991 and 1992, three Narey plays were put on at Bradford University&#8217;s
<em>Theatre in the Mill</em>. &#8220;They brought a totally new audience,&#8221;
says Tony Liddington, who was running it. &#8220;The local white working
class.&#8221; Narey&#8217;s plays began to be booked at working men&#8217;s
clubs. Some seats filled up with his former enemies. Labour and
Conservative councillors came, and moderate unions took block bookings.</p>
<p>Partly, they were relieved to see Narey busy in a different arena;
but all these no-politics drinks in the <em>Jacob&#8217;s Well</em> were
paying off as well. Not that Narey let on that he knew; his plays
were partisan to a fault, spiced with scorn for feeble unions,
councillors in the pockets of businessmen, compromised &#8220;moderates&#8221;.
His characters were either bosses, plotting and paring back wages, or
workers, gruffly ecstatic at the power of collective action.</p>
<p>If there was an element of wish-fulfilment about all this &#8211; <em>The
Promised Land</em>, for example, featured Neil Kinnock losing his seat
in a Militant landslide &#8211; there was also a deepening tint of
nostalgia. In 1993, Narey finished <em>A Party That Will</em>, a play
about the foundation of the ILP. It dramatised the Manningham Mill
strike of 1891 and its escalation, in Bradford and then beyond, into
a demand for a political party to challenge capitalism. Narey himself
played Keir Hardie, one of the ILP&#8217;s co-founders. The play was
potently done, fast and short and clear in its exposition of the
reasons for socialism. Like Narey, it switched engagingly from fond
and earthy banter to an informal didacticism: you could learn how to
strike by watching it.</p>
<p>Yet there was a sadness about the play, too, a sense that the
contours of an old optimistic struggle were being lovingly gazed over
from a less hopeful age. &#8220;To a certain extent, it was a world we
had lost,&#8221; says Kevin Wilson, then a Militant, who played one of
the strikers&#8217; leaders, &#8220;where everybody had a job, had
solidarity, had the possibility of progress.&#8221; By 1993, Lister&#8217;s
Mill in Manningham, the towering Italianate backdrop for so much of
Narey&#8217;s politics, was a weed-colonised shell.</p>
<p>Militant had emptied of potency, too. By concentrating on
particular places rather than a more general infiltration, it had
made itself vulnerable to city-by-city suppression. Meanwhile, its
brazen occupation of Bradford and Liverpool, in particular, had
angered Kinnock into action. Narey&#8217;s removal from the party was
just one, rather public expulsion in a thorough campaign. By the
mid-Nineties, Militant&#8217;s hold on Bradford had shrunk to memories
and a few hundred defiant members, marooned on the estates &#8211; the
Canterbury in particular.</p>
<p>Narey settled for a more muted and diffuse struggle. He would
campaign culturally: remember and celebrate the workers&#8217; cause
rather than seek to impose it on the political system. Some of his
Militant comrades had made the same decision. Allan Brack helped set
up the Bradford Festival, and sought to unite the city by marquees
instead of marches. Tim Moon began working at Bradford Community Broadcasting.</p>
<p>In 1995, these old colleagues gave Narey his next platform. As a
local literary figure of steadily rippling reputation, he had been
interviewed a couple of times on BCB; now, in the autumn, he joined
the station as an unpaid volunteer and, soon, was a presenter. BCB
was hardly the big time &#8211; broadcasting to a few thousand people in
Bradford and a scatter of villages &#8211; but Narey found radio quite
bewitching. Here was a chance to charm and teach on a large scale.</p>
<p>He quickly settled in among the old posters and coffee cups. At
first, he just had five minutes on a show called <em>The Write Stuff</em>,
to chat about play-writing, or literature in general, or growl out a
poem or two of his. Soon, &#8220;the biggest problem was getting him to
shut up again&#8221;, says Lucy Robbins, who presented the programme with
him.</p>
<p>Narey was given another show, <em>Under The Clock</em>, a political
phone-in. From the small, dark studio at the back of BCB, spectacles
perched near the end of his nose, he co-hosted with abrasive zest.
Councillors and community leaders were invited on, and questioned
until they gave clear answers. Narey&#8217;s background spiced the
encounters, but it did not overpower them &#8211; an unyielding sharpness
towards official opinion seemed to satisfy him. When, in 1995,
several hundred young Asians rioted through Manningham after
perceiving police harassment, Narey was quick to link the words
&#8220;Bradford&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yet for all the surprised admiration his stances drew &#8211; with
Militant no longer a threat, his intransigence began to look like
integrity &#8211; he was saying rather than doing. Meanwhile, the city&#8217;s
struggles were all around. Narey&#8217;s own estate, Thorpe Edge,
exemplified the worst of them: heroin addiction, condemned housing,
whole crumbling concrete streets without work, young men indoors all
day with their droning televisions. Once, the tower blocks had had
their own High Rise Tenants&#8217; Association, but it had dissolved
away. Narey saw the opportunity: in 1995, he gathered the tenants
together and took them to a council meeting. &#8220;He&#8217;d say, &#8216;I want
them to come forward&#8217;,&#8221; remembers Gary Armitage. &#8220;&#8217;The
buggers are sitting on their arses.&#8217;&#8221; Narey quickly began a
general campaign for refurbishment: the blocks got new radiators, an
intercom system, a new coat of paint that wouldn&#8217;t take graffiti.
They even got closed-circuit TV cameras.</p>
<p>For the first time, perhaps, Narey&#8217;s politics had found a
simple, symbol-free aim: the tangible transformation of ordinary
lives. Some of his projects were small and specific &#8211; he founded
the Friends of Haigh Beck to clean up a beech-lined stream that ran
through the estate and that had become a ravine choked with rubbish;
others were grand and city-wide &#8211; he joined a committee bidding for
money for all Bradford&#8217;s estates from the Government&#8217;s Single
Regeneration Budget.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, by the start of this year, Narey had settled into a
middle age of routines and niggling ambitions. &#8220;A lot of people saw
Keith in the pub, and they thought, &#8216;Keith&#8217;s in the pub again,&#8217;&#8221;
says Brack. &#8220;But I always saw him as coming into town with a
mission: to drop off some papers, go to a union office, go to the
library to research local labour history &#8211; and then be in the pub
looking like he&#8217;d been there all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Narey was dreaming of television. BBC2 had shown an interest in
<em>Union Man</em>. Then there was a new play, <em>The Day They Shot
Martin Offiah</em>, about an assassination plot by the National Front
against the rugby league player. And an autobiography, <em>Rainy Day
City</em>, full of India and remembered sex and rushes of
Kerouac-style rumination. Narey wanted to expand beyond populist,
barely fictional dramas. Not everyone saw this as wise: &#8220;You
could&#8217;ve wall-papered his flat with rejection slips,&#8221; says Brian.</p>
<p>When Allen Ginsberg died in April, Narey was moved to make a
special broadcast on BCB. It was his best: carefully weighted and
slow, his thick vowels delicately wrapping the dramas of the poet&#8217;s
life &#8211; his &#8220;mad chase across America&#8221;, his &#8220;smashing into
pieces&#8221; of conservative icons, his &#8220;leading role in the peace
movement&#8221;. As Narey&#8217;s voice steadily rose, it was not hard to
hear the words as autobiography. At the end, he declared it so: &#8220;With
the death of Allen Ginsberg, I suppose a part of me dies as well.
Certainly that part of my footloose, adverturesome youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirsty McLean had moved out. &#8220;She said he was a very mucky
person,&#8221; says Raghvir Virdee. But Narey kept talking about her,
even as he started going to singles&#8217; nights. He wanted a wife, and
children. His only paid work was in the pub. Yet Narey was not all
melancholy. For one things, the weeks were melting away towards
election day. Narey liked to bash on about &#8220;Tory Blair&#8221;, but he
was thrilled to see the Conservatives imploding. Brian remembers: &#8220;He
said to me before the election, &#8216;I can&#8217;t wait for Blair to be in
power ... then I can attack him!&#8217;&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">On election night he worked at the <em>Brewery Tap</em> as usual. It
closed noisy and late. The next day was giddier still. In the
<em>Pennington Midland Hotel</em> in the city centre, the jazz night, a
favourite of Narey&#8217;s, was given over to victory marches. He stayed
until the last bus, swallowing down his bitter like champagne. Then
it was on to the Brewery Tap. Harry Parkin, one of Narey&#8217;s activist
allies on Thorpe Edge, saw him walking from the bus stop: &#8220;He was
overjoyed ... I was off to the British Legion, and he said, &#8216;Aren&#8217;t
you coming for a drink?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No, I&#8217;m going to sell raffle
tickets.&#8217; He said, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to celebrate.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>There were two inches of whisky left in the bottle when Narey left
the <em>Brewery Tap</em>, just before midnight. He lurched towards home
by his usual route: across the road that bordered Thorpe Edge, along
the path through the trees and past his tower block&#8217;s garages. The
wall running up to his front door, in this light, was the same colour
as the rest of the building. Narey wasn&#8217;t feeling careful.</p>
<p>Years before, when their father was dying of cancer, Keith and
Brian had agreed to help each other avoid the same fate. &#8220;If either
of us ended up like that,&#8221; says Brian, &#8220;The other would sneak in
a Lucozade bottle of whisky and 200 aspirins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, though, he died rapidly. His lungs were fatally flooded,
most likely, within three or four minutes of his fall. This
information was not well received at the inquest. Brian Narey stood
up from his seat for much of the proceedings, the ceiling tiles of
the coroner&#8217;s court low over his fury of red hair. He blurted
despairing questions. Why had the security guard called the police so
late? Why hadn&#8217;t the security cameras, as it turned out, recorded
what it saw? Why hadn&#8217;t he gone to help?</p>
<p>The answers were saddening and routine as the beige courtroom
walls. Security guards were not permitted to leave their posts: they
might be attacked, or deliberately distracted. An ambulance had not
been called because drunks had abused ambulancemen. The police had
not arrived for an hour because they had been dealing with an armed
robbery, and an intruder on someone&#8217;s premises, and a sprawl of
drunk drivers, and a scatter of &#8220;domestics&#8221;. The kinder city that
Keith Narey had lived to create seemed to recede, palpably, as the
witnesses mumbled on. The council couldn&#8217;t even maintain the
security cameras he had lobbied for.</p>
<p>For his verdict, the coroner said a few stern sentences about a
lack of &#8220;good Samaritans&#8221; and &#8220;a reflection on our society&#8221;,
and concluded that &#8220;Mr Narey was the author of his own downfall&#8221;.
Brian Narey walked rigid from the court, promising &#8220;further action&#8221;.</p>
<p>Brian is 58, and still works in a mill warehouse. He lives in a
box of a council house, with broken bottle glass on the pavement
outside. There are big gaps in his neighbours&#8217; garden fences, only
tabloids are on sale behind the heavy shutters of his estate&#8217;s one
shop. In a sense, his brother&#8217;s life was a series of labours to
escape all this. More generously, it was about aiding others to do
the same. In both tasks, it can be argued, he failed. Militant
fizzled, Haigh Beck still fills with litter, Narey met with a prosaic
and neglected end.</p>
<p>Yet his worth can be felt, perhaps, in the changes to those once
around him. Brian talks about Kerouac now, and seems a little
reluctant to distribute Keith&#8217;s book collection. To relax at
weekends, he tries an Indian remedy his brother taught him. The
<em>Phoenix Theatre Group</em> has renamed itself the <em>Keith Narey
Players</em> and has just put on a performance of <em>A Party That Will</em>
at the Alhambra. The profits are to be spent on a Keith Narey
playwrighting scholarship.</p>
<p>Raghvir Virdee, in the meantime, has gone from ethnic agitator to
Bradford city councillor. He has a semi with coriander waving behind,
and a photograph on his mantelpiece, of white and brown Bradford
faces holding a banner reading &#8220;Labour Conquers All&#8221;. These days,
the city he helps govern seems a little cleaner, more bustling, more
hopeful. Keith Narey, Virdee says, was &#8220;a very practical and
romantic socialist&#8221;.</p>
<p>Narey also left an excuse for a cricket match. The first one, in
mid-May, was rained off. It was attempted again, a month later, on a
cool Pennine day of racing clouds and lowering grey. Water had to be
brushed off the wicket. Then someone said a few gruff words over the
wind about &#8220;our Keith&#8221;. A buttery sun slid out, and stayed for an
innings. And the <em>Brewery Tap</em>, who always lost against Camra,
clunked the winning run as the first fat drops hit the wicket.</p>
