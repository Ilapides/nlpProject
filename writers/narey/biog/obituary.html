<p class="fst">KEITH NAREY has tragically died aged 50. While Keith might not be
so well known to newer members of our party, he was certainly
unmissable to anyone around in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

<p>He was a first-class public speaker. He had the ability to see
what was in an audience&#8217;s hearts and then the power to express it.
He had a razor sharp wit. Many a right-wing Labour councillor would
cross the road rather than be confronted with Keith&#8217;s tongue.</p>

<p>His political contribution lay in being one of the founders of
<b>Militant</b> [the Socialist Party&#8217;s predecessor] in the Bradford
area. His abilities at rallies and demonstrations meant that <b>Militant</b>
maintained a high public profile. Eventually our growing support led
to the election of Pat Wall as MP for Bradford North in 1987. Keith
had an important hand in this historic breakthrough.</p>

<p>Keith was a larger than life character. He was the organiser of
the first (and only) Yorkshire pudding eating competition in aid of
<b>Militant</b>&#8217;s fighting fund. On one occasion he took to wearing
a full North African Tuareg outfit around the pubs claiming that he
had swapped it for some Old Holborn rolling tobacco while on holiday
in Morocco. Whether his stories were true didn&#8217;t really matter &#8211;
the art was in the telling and listening.</p>

<p>He eventually took to writing plays, getting some staged in the
Bradford area. Keith was an important figure in the earlier years of
our party. What we have now is partly up to him. He will be badly
missed both by his family and his comrades.</p>
