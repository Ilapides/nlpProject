<p class="fst">The deepening economic crisis, and growing opposition of trade
unionists to cuts, unemployment and falling living standards as shown
by the NUPE demo, provides the background for renewed attempts by the
right wing and the Tory press to launch a witch-hunt in the Labour Party.</p>
<p>In a series of articles in the <strong>Times</strong> by reporter Neville
Hodgkinson, it is <strong>Militant</strong> supporters and other left wingers
in Bradford who were put under attack.</p>
<p>Apart from resurrecting allegations already made by <strong>The
Observer</strong>, <strong>The Times</strong> so-called revelations concern
unsubstantiated allegations by Mr Robert Hallam, until recently the
secretary of the Allerton West members branch of the Bradford West
Labour Party.</p>
<p>According to <strong>The Times</strong> Mr Hallam stated that Peter
Whitaker, Chairman of Allerton West branch attempted to recruit him
to a &#8220;secret <strong>Militant</strong> organisation&#8221;, aiming to subvert the
Labour Party.</p>
<p>What <strong>The Times</strong> does not tell Labour Party members is that
Mr Hallam, when a Bradford City Councillor voted for the Tory Housing
Finance Act. He justified his action in the local press by stating
that this hated piece of anti-working class legislation was
&#8220;socialist&#8221; &#8211; truly an extraordinary imagination!</p>
<p>Mr Hallam states &#8220;Peter was paying &#0163;1.50 a week, (to this
organisation), a fairly hefty subscription for someone on a low
wage.&#8221; The <strong>Militant</strong> fighting fund is published every week in
the paper. How terrible that a corporation gardener should donate
part of his own money to support the paper of his choice?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Conspiracy</h4>
<p class="fst">Another Hallam statement: &#8220;Members of foreign groups had stayed
in Bradford and Mr Whitaker had gone to Poland for a month earlier
this year as a guest of &#8216;one of the comrades&#8217;.&#8221; Even Peter&#8217;s
ordinary holidays are turned into an international conspiracy!</p>
<p>Peter Whitaker did have three foreign guests in his modest semi
who stayed for several weeks. They were Chilean refugees.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Trotskyist dominated Bradford Trades Council&#8221; has brought
over sixth Chilean refugees to Bradford, men, women and children,
with very little help from Mr Edward Lyons or the right wing of
Bradford West Labour Party.</p>
<p>Peter Whitaker is Chairman of NUPE No.&nbsp;1 branch and a shop
steward of several years standing. He has occupied several positions
in the Labour Party.</p>
<p>He has worked hard and consistently for the Labour Party despite
the need for continual medical treatment, a fact of which Mr Hallam
is well aware, which makes one wonder if that is the reason Peter was
selected for the most vicious attacks.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Tory press campaign has been to prove the
existence of a plot to oust Mr Edward Lyons MP. Mr Lyons has had his
problems with the constituency party. In 1971 following his action as
one of the Labour MPs who voted with the Tories on the Common Market
and kept the Heath government in office, opposition arose to Mr Lyons
in the Party. By a narrow margin he obtained a vote of confidence.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that only two members of the GMC
supported the political viewpoint of the <strong>Militant</strong> at that time.</p>
<p>Edward Lyons is well known as an extreme &#8220;Moderate&#8221;. He
refused to support the TUC and Labour Party in seeking the release of
the Shrewsbury pickets, and more recently he abstained from voting in
the House of Commons in the motion to lift the bans on the Clay Cross
Councillors taking local government office in future.</p>
<p>However no resolution to unseat Mr Lyons has been discussed by any
branch or affiliated organisation in the recent period. The &#8216;plot&#8217;
is entirely a figment of the imagination of the right wing and the press.</p>
<p>The evidence consists, believe it or not, in the enthusiastic way
supporters of the <strong>Militant</strong> express their views and recruit
members to the Labour Party.</p>
<p>Four of the people named in <strong>The Times</strong> article live in the
Manningham ward of the constituency. They rented a house there in
1975 when three of them were at university together. All were already
members of the Labour Party.</p>
<p>They found the Manningham branch in the doldrums, financially weak
and demoralised by election defeats. Meetings had ceased, only a
handful of individuals carrying the branch.</p>
<p>Two of the student newcomers were elected Chairman and Secretary
with <em>Edward Lyons counting the votes</em>, and recruitment was
started. Political discussions were revived and a Council candidate
elected to fight one of the three sitting Tories.</p>
<p>An enthusiastic campaign committee went out to the voters, won the
Asian support and took the ward from the Tories with a swing of over
a thousand votes, against the national trend.</p>
<p>Today the ward has money in the bank, regular meetings in premises
supplied free by the Asian members, lively debate to which members of
other branches come, and an ever increasing membership.</p>
<p>Through the efforts of the County Councillor for Manningham,
Councillor Manawar Hussein, a large Bengali membership has been built.</p>
<p>This is in sharp contrast to the situation that Manawar Hussein
described existed before, as quoted in the <strong>Times</strong> article
itself: &#8220;When he tried to join the party in 1962 and 1963 his
applications were twice mislaid, he said, and he was given an
indication that it was not an accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are told in the <strong>Times</strong>&#8217;that on one day in October
eleven new applications for membership from students were received.
This is supposed to imply a &#8220;bed-sitter&#8221; takeover of the Party.</p>
<p>The day was the day of freshers conference when the Labour Club at
the University organised a big display at the conference and signed
up over a hundred students, eleven of which joined the Party itself.</p>
<p>Eight students also transferred their membership from their home
constituencies or to different members branches if they had moved
house in the summer. So much for the insinuation that students had
been &#8220;forced to live in University ward&#8221;, when most of the
students concerned live in halls of residence which happens to be in
University ward.</p>
<p>When these students leave halls, as most do during the first year,
will we then hear that they are being forced out to other wards to
unseat the MP there?</p>
<p>Why indeed were these issues raised in the Tory press instead of
inside the Party. The <strong>Times</strong> has never been a champion of the
working class and must be delighted to be the instrument of it&#8217;s
discomfort. The fact that names and addresses were printed in full
seems to be an open invitation to groups like the National Front to
harass or intimidate those named.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago the Social Democratic Alliance held a meeting in
Bradford Labour Party rooms, yet no murmurs to the press about
organised factions were heard.</p>
<p>The tissue of lies, smears, innuendo and sheer nonsense must be
exposed for what it is: The cringing and whining of people beaten by
the political ideas and approach of the <strong>Militant</strong> supporters,
which is why their support has grown.</p>
<p>We are not ashamed to be seen as the hardest workers in the Party
or as those with the most viable political programme or the most
realistic in our analysis and ideas.</p>
<p>If these people are afraid of our ideas but lack ideas of their
own, let them listen to the workers and their problems. That should
make them realise that only the Marxist solutions of the <strong>Militant</strong>
can point the way forward, the alternative to capitalism and crisis
lies in moving towards a socialist transformation of society and not
in hypocritical, bitter witch-hunts against other members of the
Labour Party.</p>
