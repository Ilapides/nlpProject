<h1>Bradford Fines</h1>

<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;306, 28 May 1976, p.&nbsp;2.<br/>
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">Fines totalling &#0163;740 were imposed on ten defendants when they
came up before Bradford magistrates last Thursday following
disturbances during the recent demonstration of the National Front in
the town (see <strong>Militant</strong>, no.&nbsp;303). Most were charged with
&#8216;insulting or threatening behaviour&#8217;. According to eyewitnesses,
they claimed that the police had just pulled many of the accused at
random out of the crowd.</p>
<p>Bradford Trades Council has expressed its dismay at the vicious
fines while not fully agreeing with the actions of some of the
demonstrators in being involved with incidents with the police at the time.</p>
<p>The Trades Council compared the charging of those demonstrating
against fascism with the failure to charge two youths who destroyed
the Trades Council banner on a previous anti-racialist march
organised by the Labour Party Young Socialists. The Trades Council is
to support all the defendants with finance. A collection fund is
being organised to pay the fines. (See letters page 10)</p>
<p>The irony is that the size of the fines per person is larger than
fines imposed by magistrates on firms contravening the Health and
Safety Act when failing to supply respirators or protective clothing
to workers using asbestos. The fine then was only &#0163;10.</p>
