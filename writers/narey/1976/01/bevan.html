Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">A meeting of the Bradford Tribune Group unanimously passed a
resolution condemning the attacks on supporters of the <strong>Militant</strong>
by the Tory press and the right wing of the party.</p>
<p>The meeting, which was attended by 40 people, also criticised the
actions of the National Union of Labour Organisers in boycotting Andy
Bevan and called upon them to substitute these McCarthyite tactics
with open and democratic discussion in the party of their differences.</p>
<p>In a subsequent resolution unanimous support was again given to a
call for the nationalisation of the 200 monopolies and banks and
finance houses, as the only solution to the present crisis and cuts
in working class living standards.</p>
<p>An appeal was also made to the delegates to support letters which
have been sent out to several trade union branches and Labour Party
members&#8217; branches in the area explaining <strong>Militant</strong>&#8217;s
position and asking the branches to invite a speaker along to explain
what <strong>Militant</strong> stands for. Several branches promised to do this.</p>
