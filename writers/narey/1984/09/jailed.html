<p class="fst">SEVEN YOUNG workers from Armthorpe in Yorkshire were sent to
prison on Tuesday for relatively minor offences.</p>

<p>The five miners and two unemployed &#8211; including an LPYS member
and a <strong>Militant</strong> supporter &#8211; received sentences of between 3&#8211;6
months after being charged with causing criminal damage and using
insulting words and behaviour.</p>

<p>In what must be a warning for the labour movement, this was one of
the first cases to be heard by a stipendiary magistrate. It is clear
that these &#8216;flying judges&#8217; are being sent out to inflict judicial
revenge and vindictiveness on the miners on behalf of the government.</p>

<p>The seven were arrested after an incident in the village on a
Saturday night. While the incident itself cannot be condoned &#8211; but
the frustration of these young workers well understood &#8211; the
severity of the sentences must be fought by the labour movement.</p>

<p>The sentences are totally disproportionate to the charges, which
usually carry a fine or binding over. The local paper carried a
report the day before where the crime was more serious; seven youths
called out a police car and then ambushed it. Two of them received
Â£200 fines while the rest were bound over.</p>

<p>Local people believe the severity of the sentences is revenge for
the political activity and successful demonstration in the village
following an earlier police riot there (see page 3). Indeed, while
the rest were sent into youth custody and Detention Centres, Guy
Bennet, a Markham Main NUM and LPYS member who played a leading part
in the protests, and <strong>Militant</strong> supporter and unemployed miner
Mark Camplin were sent to prison.</p>

<p>However, the movement is beginning to take up the issue. A picket
was held at Doncaster magistrates court where the cases were heard,
and a protest meeting called for Thursday September 13. Plans for a
mass demonstration outside the prison must be drawn up, involving the
miners, trade unionists and the LPYS.</p>

<p>It is vital that in any settlement of the miners strike, an
amnesty is ensured for all miners who have faced trumped up charges,
and their jobs guaranteed whether the offences took place on the
picket lines or as the result of police activities in their communities.</p>
