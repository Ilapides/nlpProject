<p class="fst">AS WE reported last week the pit village of Armthorpe, Yorkshire,
has been virtually under martial law with 1,000 police occupying the village.</p>

<p>Peter, a part-time park keeper explained what happened to him:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The police accused me of throwing a bottle &#8211; I
pointed to my arms, both arthritic, &#8216;how could I throw &#8217;owt wi
these? I had to pack up work eight years ago.&#8217; They shoved my arms
up my back &#8211; I shouted &#8216;go steady, I&#8217;ve just had a heart
operation, you&#8217;re hurting&#8217;. They ignored me. They were abusing
and swearing at me all the time. Then in the van they threatened to
beat me up saying &#8216;work him over, make it look if he&#8217;s had a
heart attack&#8217;. I was really frightened by now &#8211; they were from
the Greater Manchester Police. I was taken to Doncaster and charged
with criminal damage. I was kept in from 4&nbsp;p.m. on Tuesday till
11.40&nbsp;a.m. on Wednesday.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">A police wagon reversed into the yard of Mrs Kennedy, 59 years
old, of Charles Crescent. Her son and three other pickets were having
a cup of tea. When they saw the police piling out, the son went to
lock the front door while Mrs Kennedy went to lock the back door, but
found the police already in the lobby. She told them to &#8216;bugger off
and get away&#8217;. Her son heard her scream and ran into the kitchen,
where he saw the policeman had trapped his mother&#8217;s head in the
door and were slamming the door repeatedly on her head.</p>

<p>Mrs Kennedy was later treated by a doctor for shock and bruising.</p>

<p>Bob Worthy was approached by a sergeant, No.&nbsp;246, of the
Greater Manchester force and asked: &#8216;What do you think you&#8217;re
doing&#8217;? &#8216;I live here&#8217;, said Bob. The sergeant then shoved him
backwards over a concrete wall. When he stood up he was surrounded by
six constables with drawn truncheons.</p>

<p>As Bob said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;My kids saw me attacked on my own property today, they
won&#8217;t understand yet, but I&#8217;ll make sure they do when they&#8217;re
older. I won&#8217;t let them forget.&#8221;</p>
