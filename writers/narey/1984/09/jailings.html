<p class="fst">The LYPS held a protest picket outside Doncaster Magistrates court
on Thursday 14 September. It was in protest at the vicious jail
sentences imposed on two members of the LPYS in Armthorpe. These
sentences were the first to be imposed by Thatcher&#8217;s &#8216;flying
judges&#8217;, the stipendiary magistrates.</p>

<p>The stipendiary magistrate in question is James Barry. He is a
barrister in London, but has been specially selected as one of the 40
to be sent up to the coal fields to deal out &#8216;justice&#8217; to the miners.</p>

<p>The last time that stipendiary magistrates were used was in the
1930&#8217;s, to deal with the unemployed workers. At that time they were
hated by the working class because of the harshness of the sentences
they passed out. Today Thatcher is not only returning to the economic
conditions of the 1930&#8217;s, but it returning to the judicial
vengeance of that period.</p>

<p>However, the strength and solidarity of the NUM and the mining
communities must stand out against these sentences.</p>

<p>The LPYS appeal to all branches around the country to send letters
of support to the two young socialists concerned, Guy Bennet and Mark
Camplin, care of Her Majesty&#8217;s Prison, Armley, Leeds. It will show
these comrades that they are not isolated and that they have the
support of the Young Socialists and the labour movement.</p>
