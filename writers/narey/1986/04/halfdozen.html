<p class="fst"><strong>AFTER THREE years on strike, the number of Hindle strikers has
dwindled to six. But their spirit and determination remains undimmed.</strong></p>

<p>The &#8216;Dirty Half Dozen&#8217; still meet every Friday in the AUEW
offices to carry on their defiance.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We&#8217;re still fighting, but when is the TUC going to
wake up to the fact that this government is trying to knock us off
one by one, and that the only response has got to be a united fight
... a general strike to get &#8216;em out?&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;With all these sackings and new laws it&#8217;s impossible
to stick to the old ways. They&#8217;re saying it&#8217;s virtually illegal
to go on strike now, that you can have a union so long as management
run it!&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;What are the TUC and our union leaders doing about it?
Are they fighting? Are they hell, they&#8217;re using the Tory laws as an
excuse not to fight&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">All the strikers were agreed that the next Labour government must
start by scrapping the anti-union laws that the Tories had introduced
... &#8220;Then maybe we&#8217;d get our jobs back ... Aye that&#8217;d sicken
Hindle right off ...&#8221;</p>

<p>It has been a pleasure and a privilege to have known and worked
with all the Hindles&#8217; strikers and their wives, over the past few
years, and to know that the fighting spirit that they have shown is
present in other layers of our class.</p>

<p>If this spirit and courage were shown by the leaders of our
movement then Thatcher wouldn&#8217;t have survived her first term.
Supporters of <strong>Militant</strong> can feel proud of the support that we
have given to the Hindle pickets, but above all proud of these
magnificent fighters for our class.</p>
