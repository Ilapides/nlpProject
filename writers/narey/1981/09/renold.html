<p class="fst">An important victory has been won in the fight against redundancy
by workers at Renold Fluid Power in Bradford.</p>

<p>Following recent re-organisation it was obviously decided by the
top management that the recession could be used to implement a cost
cutting exercise. When the workers at Bradford exhausted procedure in
pursuance of their wage claim, they were faced with a demand for 35 redundancies.</p>

<p>The decision of the workforce was to occupy the plant. The dispute
was made official by the AUEW district committee, and support was
canvassed from the joint site committee and the Renold combine committee.</p>

<p>Support was promised from outside factories and the appeal sheets
were just about to be distributed when management caved in and
offered an improved pay offer of between 7 and 9%.</p>

<p>This is the first victory against a company which has low wages, a
Victorian outlook and extensive overseas outlets. Already, following
the recent one-hour strike in support of Croft Gears wage claim, the
company has hinted at shifting jobs abroad. Favourite must be the
South African subsidiary of Renold, where unions are banned and wages
on the poverty line.</p>

<p>But this victory has demonstrated that once the workers take
possession of the machines on which the wealth is created, with
support of the workforce and the labour movement, the bosses are
helpless.</p>
