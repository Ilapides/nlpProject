<p class="c"><strong>BRADFORD <em>MILITANT</em> supporters learned with sadness that
Tommy Hare had died aged 81 of a heart attack on 7 September.</strong></p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">Tommy was a life-long UCATT member; branch president until he was
80; still attending his fortnightly meetings and defending his ideas
with a clarity and vigour lacking in many half his age.</p>

<p>I first met Tommy in the early 70s on the Bradford Trades Council.
He was a member of the Communist Party then, having stood as a
parliamentary candidate for them after the war. But after he had
worked alongside Pat Wall, we were able to persuade him of <strong>Militant</strong>&#8217;s ideas.</p>

<p>He became an active comrade &#8211; standing for the local council
when in his 70s, selling papers on the street, always on picket lines
and demonstrations. He often said he wished he had found <strong>Militant</strong>
earlier, regarding his years in the CP as wasted.</p>

<p>I used to go for a pint with him after paper sales and the
conversations were always lively, sprinkled with Tommy&#8217;s dry wit
and passionate arguments.</p>

<p>When the right-wing backlash hit Bradford North after Pat Wall&#8217;s
parliamentary victory, Tommy fought tooth and nail to ensure UCATT
supported Pat&#8217;s reselection.</p>

<p>In stature he was small but his dedication and courage made him
ten feet tall in my eyes. I dedicated my first play, <em>Union Man</em>,
to him.</p>

<p>He was and remains a shining example and inspiration to us all.
Goodbye Tommy, the fight goes on.</p>
