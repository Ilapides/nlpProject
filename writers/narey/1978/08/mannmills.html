<p class="fst"><i>It is over a year now since the Tory press took up its
campaign against Marxism in the British labour movement. At that
time right wing Labour MPs and cabinet ministers such as Shirley
Williams argued that socialists who believed in the existence of a
class struggle &#8211; labelled by Harold Wilson as &#8220;comers-in&#8221; &#8211;
had no place in the tradition of the British labour movement and
should somehow be removed from the Labour Party.</i></p>
<p><i>This view is consistent with the &#8220;official&#8221; history
taught to each new generation &#8211; that the trade unions and Labour
Party have always been &#8220;moderate&#8221; organisations of
&#8220;responsible&#8221; people who rejected such foreign notions of
class conflict and mass struggle. But the real traditions of the
British working class are light years removed from this one-sided
view. Those mighty organisations of labour were built up by the
mass movement of the workers themselves in times of bitter
conflict and upheaval, always in the face of the ruthless and
openly biased intervention of the state on the side of the
employers.</i></p>
<p><i>It was out of a huge wave of militant industrial struggles
involving dockers, gasworkers, match girls and many others in the
1890s that the Labour Party was created. In this article Keith
Narey, Chairman of Manningham Branch Labour Party, who was last
year picked out for attack by the Tory press as a Marxist, gives
an account of how one such battle led to the formation of the
Independent Labour Party, a forerunner of the Labour Party.</i></p>

<p class="fst">The Manningham Mills strike of 1890 in Bradford was a turning
point in the history of working class struggle, not only for the
local movement but also having repercussions nationally.</p>
<p>It clearly showed the basic class conflict between labour and
capital, exposing the sham paternalism of many mill owners, and
furthermore highlighted the true class loyalties of the Liberal party.</p>

<p>The owner of Manningham Mills was one of the archetypal
&#8216;entrepreneurial&#8217; capitalists who had built the wool trade in
Bradford, mainly by purchasing patents of all combing machines so
that he could monopolise the trade with his own Lister-Donnisthorpe machine.</p>

<p>His name was Samuel Cunliffe Lister, later to become Lord Masham
after spending &#163;800,000 of his profits on buying country estates at
Swinton Park and Jervaulx Abbey.</p>

<p>He had amassed his fortune by building up his mill in Manningham
to a massive complex employing 5,000 operatives. Due to the lack of
trade union organisation among his largely female workforce, he was
able to cut wages during the 1880s.</p>

<p>The workers grumbled that the 30% reductions during this period
were never restored in boom years. The last straw came when, in
response to the McKinlay tariff, Lister announced wage cuts of up to
35% in certain departments.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Low wages</h4>

<p class="fst">The managing director has the cheek to describe wages of 14/&#8211; per
week as &#8220;unnaturally high&#8221; and pleaded for reduced wages to
defeat foreign competition. Those words have a similar ring today and
the argument was proved just as fallacious the when it was pointed
out that most of the competition came from Germany where wages were
almost double those at Lister&#8217;s!</p>

<p>The workers angrily drew attention to the previous year&#8217;s profit
of &#163;138,000 and the dividend of 10%, the feeling being that past
profits should help to bolster present losses.</p>

<p>Lister&#8217;s attitude to the workers and that of his managers
contributed to the tension and one of the operatives remarked that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... <i>the opinion of the work people with whom I am
acquainted is that there are too many gentlemen to maintain who wear
collars and cuffs: also petty under managers strutting about with
pencils and notebooks who might be better employed ...&#8221;</i></p>

<p class="fst">Despite the lack of union organisation, after negotiations with
the directors had failed, on the 16th December 1890, the operatives
walked out in protest &#8211; in the middle of winter and just before
Christmas. They called on the Weavers&#8217; Association and Bradford
Trades Council to help them organise. The result was widespread
working class support for the strike.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Appeal</h4>

<p class="fst">The Weavers&#8217; Association circulated 25,000 copies of a manifesto
calling for trade union support, outlining the significance of this
dispute for the working class. An excerpt reads:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In the face of these low wages we are of the opinion
that we should be doing not only an injustice to ourselves but to the
whole of the textile industry in the West Riding of Yorkshire by
accepting the proposed reduction ... help us fight against this
enormous reduction. Our battle may be your battle in the immediate
future. We trust, therefore, that in our present state of need and
disorganisation you will liberally support us.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This special appeal raised a magnificent total of &#163;11,000 mainly
from trade unions, and a large amount from the Yorkshire Miners&#8217; Association.</p>

<p>The strike united many diverse political elements in the trade
unions, and brought to the fore many radicals in previously moderate
trade unions. The support of socialists such as Fred Jowett of the
Bradford power loom overlookers, Ben Turner and W.H. Drew of the
Weavers, as well as Ben Tillett and Tom Mann, helped to politicise
the strike and pave the way for future developments.</p>

<p>The Bradford Trades Council was also politicised, with the
radicals gaining control against the liberals, and organising street
collections, public meetings and concerts to support the strikers.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Mass meetings</h4>

<p class="fst">Lister aroused the anger of the strikers by accusing the women of
walking around in fine furs while the men drank the profits from the
begging bowl. He also threatened to close the Manningham Mills
altogether as &#8216;uneconomic&#8217;, but these arguments, again familiar
to workers today, were exposed by the strike leaders, with reference
to the wages paid in other concerns in the area which were higher.</p>

<p>The ranks of the strikers were swelled by other departments of
Manningham Mills walking out in sympathy, especially the overlookers
who refused to train blackleg labour and were subsequently locked out
and then fired.</p>

<p>The meetings called by the strike committee rapidly broadened into
mass public sympathy meetings, and began to debate the political
issues involved. The Tory council, dominated by the wool merchants
and mill owners, reacted by sending in the police to intimidate and
harass pickets and members of the public attending the meetings.</p>

<p>Public protest meetings against these tactics, organised by the
Bradford Trades Council, reached massive proportions. <i>At several
open air meetings attendances reached between 60,000 and 90,000.</i>
The watch committee responded by banning all open meetings except
under licence.</p>

<p>This led to a massive outcry against suppression of free speech.
Demands were made to liberal councillors but they sided with the
authorities. The police replied with arbitrary arrests, and in one
case a seventeen year old girl was charged with &#8216;intimidation&#8217;
against two burly male blacklegs!</p>

<p>The dispute now attained national prominence and underlined the
political, as well as industrial, struggle between capital and
labour, adding to the socialists demand for an independent political party.</p>

<p>In defiance of the ban on public meetings, the strike committee
and the Trades Council organised a meeting on Sunday April 12th 1891.
The vast crowds overflowed into the public square by the Town Hall,
and after arresting Ben Turner and Councillor Harry Saunders from
Rotherham, the police cleared the square.</p>

<p>The following day large crowds gathered in the town centre,
determined to fight the council&#8217;s ban on public assembly and free
speech. Extra police were called in, along with 106 members of the
Durham Light Infantry.</p>

<p><i>The mayor read the Riot Act, and the streets were cleared,
first by police with batons, then by the soldiers with fixed bayonets.</i></p>

<p>The ensuing street battles, which raged from the afternoon until
midnight, with the crowds hurling knives and stones at the troops,
became something of a legend in Bradford labour history, and were
described by some as being &#8216;like scenes from the French revolution&#8217;.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Starved</h4>

<p class="fst">This was followed by a meeting on the following Saturday of <i>90,000
people</i> in the town centre. The crowd was so vast that five
platforms of speakers were required simultaneously in order to
address the audience.</p>

<p>The strike, however, was being starved to an end. With a
hard-faced attitude similar to that of the Tory Party today, the Poor
Law guardians refused relief to strikers and anyone who refused to
blackleg, local traders were forced to withdraw credit and after
nineteen heroic weeks the workers were forced back.</p>

<p>But from this defeat came some great victories. Trade union
organisation was boosted by thousands of new members and new unions
sprang up to take in unskilled and casual workers. The Bradford
Trades Council shed its liberal leadership and became committed to
independent, working class politics.</p>

<p>One of the strike leaders, Charlie Glyde, later to be secretary of
the Gas Workers&#8217; Union, said at one of the mass meetings: <i>&#8220;We
have had two parties in the past; the &#8216;can&#8217;ts&#8217; and the &#8216;won&#8217;ts&#8217;
and it&#8217;s time we had a party that will.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>The &#8216;party that will&#8217; was formed a month later at Firth&#8217;s
Temperance Hotel in East Parade, Bradford. This was the Independent
Labour Party <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>, which was to have its
national founding conference two years later in Bradford. The leaders
stated: &#8220;The Labour Party intended to have labour representation in
the Town council and to take the whip out of the hands of those who
have been flogging them ...&#8221;</p>

<p>The first Independent Labour councillor was elected in Manningham
in November 1891 and the next year Manningham returned two ILP
councillors, one of whom was Fred Jowett, later destined to be the
first ILP MP for Bradford in 1906. His words in the 1982 election
form a fitting conclusion to this episode of Labour history.</p>

<p>First on the strike itself:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&#8220;In the Lister strike, the people of Bradford saw
plainly, as they had never seen before, that whether their rulers are
Liberal or Tory, they are capitalists first and politicians afterwards.&#8221;</i></p>

<p class="fst">And finally to the Liberals and Tories:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&#8220;You have run this machine too long, we see the
prejudicial results of your management &#8211; starvation, misery, crime
and a state of general unwashedness, body and soul, and we mean to
take the matter in hand and try to make a better thing of it ourselves.&#8221;</i></p>

<p class="fst">The climate was ripe for change, Manningham provided the catalyst
and the opportunity.</p>
