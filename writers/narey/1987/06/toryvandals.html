<p class="fst"><em>JUST AS the Tory government has vandalised Bradford&#8217;s
industry, so the Bradford North Tories have resorted to vandalism
against a graphic illustration of their party&#8217;s record.</em></p>
<p>An 8&nbsp;ft by 12&nbsp;ft cartoon by Alan Hardman, depicting
Thatcher&#8217;s demolition of industry in Bradford North was fixed onto
the side of a Labour member&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>It was put up at 7&nbsp;p.m.; the Tory agent drive past at
7.15&nbsp;p.m. The occupants returned home at 11&nbsp;p.m. to find
the cartoon vandalised, with oil, paint and eggs and margarine
splashed all over it.</p>
<p>The culprits were obviously the local Tories. So great is their
fear of socialist ideas that this one sharp cartoon had to be
immediately destroyed before workers could see it. They have posters
all round Bradford North, yet not one been vandalised.</p>
<p>The Tories claim to stand for law and order and private property.
What they mean is their law, their order and their property.</p>
<p>Their actions, while outraging many Labour Party members in
Bradford North, will only strengthen their resolve to work for the
return of a socialist candidate.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We will not be set back&#8221; says cartoonist Alan
Hardman &#8220;We&#8217;ve got the energy and enthusiasm and we&#8217;ll come
straight back and do another one.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">By returning Pat Wall, Bradford North socialists will be
implementing the message inscribed on the cartoon: &#8220;<em>Keep the
Tory extremists out &#8211; vote Labour for the return of a Labour government&#8221;.</em></p>
