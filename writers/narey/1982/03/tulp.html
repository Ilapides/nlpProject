<p class="fst"><strong>After pressure from Ben Ford, the present MP for Bradford
North, the TUC have told Bradford Trades Council that their delegates
on Bradford North Labour Party can not vote in the constituency&#8217;s
fresh reselection meetings.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bradford Trades Council has long historic links with the Labour
Party. It was after the Manningham Mills strike in the city that the
Trades Council set up the Independent Labour Party to fight for
parliamentary representation for the working class. Since then the
Trades Council has consistently supported Labour.</strong></p>

<p>Such considerations seem to mean little to Ben Ford. When he first
wanted support for reselection, Ford, along with other Bradford
Labour MPs, wrote to the Trades Council seeking nomination.</p>

<p>It was only after he was defeated by Pat Wall in the first
reselection conference and the Trades Council passed a resolution in
support of their President, Pat Wall, that he wrote to the TUC,
claiming the involvement of the Trades Council was against TUC rules.</p>

<p>Labour Party rules clearly allow for full affiliation and
participation of Trades Councils. Nevertheless, the TUC wrote to
Bradford TC and told them that since 1977, trades councils could
affiliate to Labour Parties, but could neither forward resolutions
nor become involved in selection or reselection battles.</p>

<p>Although trade unionists will doubtless consider such restrictions
incredible in a period when every trade union needs to become
politically active, the Trades Council will not participation in the
reselection procedure. However we will not be disaffiliating from the
Labour Party as was claimed in an article in <strong>The Times</strong> (22
March). We would also urge trade union branches and trades councils
to fight to change this TUC rule.</p>

<p>There seems to be a move amongst some trade union right-wingers to
loosen the links between the organised trade union movement and the
Labour Party. If there is, it will be firmly opposed.</p>

<p>If Ben Ford had fought as hard to save the 2,000 jobs lost at
Bairds EMI or the 1,000 jobs lost at International Harvesters as he
has fought to save his own he might well have been reselected in the
first place!</p>
