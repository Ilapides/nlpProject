<h1>Bradford: A future if we fight for it</h1>

<p class="fst"><strong>The city of Bradford is being destroyed.</strong></p>

<p>The dilapidated mills are a grim reminder of the textile wealth on
which Bradford was built. But now growing unemployment figure herald
an even more stark and depressing future for the working people of
the city.</p>

<p>Already, this year has seen record levels of unemployment with
26,706 (15.6% of the population) out of work, and record short-time
working with redundancies in textiles up 48% on last year.</p>

<p>550 jobs have gone from GEC, 600 at International Harvesters, 300
jobs from Mintex, 350 jobs from Rank Wharfedale and now there are
rumours that the Renold operations in Bradford may close with the
loss of over 2,000 jobs.</p>

<p>With a Tory/Liberal/SDP council in charge of a &#163;5Â½ million cut
in local expenditure the traditional escape valve of a job on the
corporation has disappeared. The old answer of male emigration is now
impossible due to high unemployment right around the country.</p>

<p>This nightmare certainly doesn&#8217;t result from years of militancy
or of high wage demands. The last major strike in Bradford was in the
1930s, and wages are between 13% and 18% below the national average.</p>

<p>Workers here have worked long hours for low pay with few
complaints and are now reaping their reward &#8211; the sack. Nor can the
Tories blame high spending councils for frightening away jobs because
of extravagant rate demands. The amount spent on school pupils per
head in Bradford is the lowest in the country.</p>

<p>This year, Bradford plans to spend only half as much per pupil as
Inner London. A Department of Education report says that our city has
the most socially deprived school children in West Yorkshire with
more poor, large and badly housed families; more single parent
families, more children receiving free school meals than any other
metropolitan area.</p>

<p>Is it then, any wonder, that more and more are looking towards an
alternative that gives them some hope?</p>

<p>Already, two factories have set up work-place branches of the
Labour Party and over 40 workers have been recruited so far. The
Labour Party, for so long dominated by corrupt right-wing councillors
has now moved dramatically to the left, whilst at the same time the
sleeping giant of the trade union movement is beginning to stir.</p>

<p>The Trades Council and Bradford North Labour Party have called an
emergency conference of the entire labour and trade union movement to
discuss the fight for jobs, on <em>Saturday September 25th</em> at the
<em>Queens Hall, Bradford</em>, commencing at 10.30&nbsp;a.m.</p>

<p>This will be the launching pad for an all-out campaign in the city
to expose the appalling prospects and consequences of unemployment
and to publicise the socialist alternative.</p>

<p>We must seek to draw together not only the unions and the Labour
Party but the immigrant groups, tenants groups, community groups and
special interest groups. An appeal must also be made to the small
businessmen, many of whom such as publicans and shopkeepers face
bankruptcy as a result of factory closures.</p>

<p>We must show the people of Bradford that there is a future for
themselves and their children &#8211; black and white &#8211; <em>if they are
prepared to fight for it.</em></p>
