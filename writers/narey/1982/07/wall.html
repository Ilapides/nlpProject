<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;608, 2 July 1982, p.&nbsp;4.<br/>
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">The right wing&#8217;s attempt at a witch-hunt had its first test last
Friday and it blew up in its face. At the enforced re-run for the
selection of Labour&#8217;s prospective Parliamentary candidate in
Bradford North, <strong>Militant</strong> supporter Pat Wall increased his
majority from 7 last year to 37, defeating the sitting Labour MP Ben
Ford by 49 votes to 12.</p>

<p>When Pat Wall won last year, by 35 votes to 28, the National
Executive ordered a re-run on some farcical technical
&#8216;irregularities&#8217;. The right wing&#8217;s continued manoeuvres fell
flat when over a hundred attended the annual meeting in Eccleshill
ward it resulted in a left wing majority.</p>

<p>In the re-run no ward nominated Ford, who only gained three
nominations compared to Pat&#8217;s 21. After the selection meeting two
of Ford&#8217;s supporters came up to Pat and told him that Ford&#8217;s
speech had been so bad that they had changed their mind and voted for him.</p>

<p>Bradford North Labour Party members have made clear who they want
to fight the next election for Labour, the National Executive must
respect that right.</p>
