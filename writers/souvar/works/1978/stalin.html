<p class="fst">There are already a good number of works on Stalin and his 
regime, several of which are not without real merit, but none gives an explicit 
reply to the question asked by any attentive reader: why and how was Stalin able 
to impose himself as sole master of the pseudo-soviet empire, in spite of the 
other leaders of the single party and of the supposedly proletarian state &#8211; 
leaders who, in the opinion of all, outclassed him in every respect. For, at the 
death of Lenin in 1924, hardly anybody even knew Stalin's name, except in top 
party circles among professional revolutionaries. In the document known under 
the name of his "Testament".<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> Lenin designated five of his closest companions 
as chosen to succeed him: Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin and Pyatakov.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
Five years later Stalin had ousted all of them from the control of affairs, and 
was waiting to exterminate them. Why and how?</p>

<p class="fst">In this famous "Testament", whose existence the Communists denied 
for over thirty years, and which they denounced as a forgery when Max Eastman 
and the present historian published it in 1927,<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> but whose authenticity was 
finally admitted by Khrushchev in his secret speech of 1956,<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> Lenin said, 
expressing himself with great circumspection, that Stalin, "having become 
General Secretary, has concentrated immense power in his hands, and I am not 
convinced that he will always be capable of using it with sufficient caution". 
He did not say that Stalin had "become" General Secretary with Lenin's blessing, 
nor what this "immense power" consisted of, how this power was exercised, and 
why nothing and no one could limit it, still less oppose it.</p>

<p class="fst">Since when has the secretary of a party held such immense power? 
He was appointed to carry out the decisions of the leading body, to ensure the 
receipt and dispatch of the post, to file documents, to send out circulars, to 
supervise the work of the people below him, etc. In succession Elena Stasova, 
then Sverdlov, then Krestinsky, then the trio of Krestinsky, Preobrazhensky and 
Serebriakov, and then the trio of Molotov, Yaroslavsky and Mikhailov<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> had 
modestly assumed secretarial functions without encroaching on the authority of 
the Central Committee. All this was to change in the course of a process which 
would take several years with Stalin as General Secretary and Molotov and 
Kuibyshev<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> as his acolytes. Lenin's remark is therefore very obscure, except 
at the time for the initiates among the higher cadres of the party and the 
state, which were merged together.</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky, for his part, is a bit more explicit, because he is 
addressing a wider public, whom he wishes to inform, but he no more explains 
this "immense" and irresistible power of the General Secretary. He does not 
describe its mechanism, nor does he inform us about the <i>modus operandi</i> of 
an authority against which all objections, all resistance and all the 
oppositions had to admit that they were powerless, and beaten in advance. In his 
book on Stalin, he says that in less than two years the latter's grip on "the 
political machine" (<i>apparat</i> in Russian, from the German) "had become 
formidable".<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> This theme of the power of the "apparatus" recurs many times in 
Trotsky's writings in exile. But why and how did this apparatus, in principle 
the instrument of the party, in practice transform the party into its 
instrument? That is the question.</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky still left in the dark precisely what ought to be brought 
into the light. Ever since declaring his struggle against the leading 
"troika"<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> that posed as the exclusive guardian of Lenin's thought (1923), he 
had not ceased criticising, then denouncing and accusing the Communist 
bureaucracy, bureaucratism, in short the apparatus. Now, since the party was 
identical with the state, all its members, or nearly all, had become 
functionaries, hence bureaucrats, and hence part of the apparatus. Consequently, 
the main division within the party, between the majority and the Opposition, had 
divided the bureaucracy, the apparatus. All tendencies and factions were made up 
of functionaries in a very complicated political and economic system of which a 
detailed description would amount to a doctoral thesis. A schematic sketch will 
suffice here in order to arrive at the "why and how" of Stalin.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">The grinder of human flesh</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In a work published in 1959<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a>, having revealed the circumstances 
in which Zinoviev and Kamenev, with Lenin's consent, placed Stalin in the party 
Secretariat in 1922, the author wrote as follows: "Stalin had begun a secret and 
unprecedented task in the Secretariat of the party: one by one, he rearranged 
the personnel of the machine, on mysterious considerations known to himself 
alone." And then: "As a rule, discipline was a sufficient reason for nominations 
and transfers."<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> In the following pages the author described and commented 
upon the rise of Stalin to absolute power and his methods of putting an end to 
all resistance. But at that time, the beginning of the '30s, through lack of 
sufficient information, the secret of Stalin's omnipotence had not yet been 
brought into focus with the necessary precision; we might even say &#8211; in its 
living and prosaic reality, in its stupefying vulgarity.</p>

<p class="fst">There are therefore grounds for making concrete what this work 
explained in these terms: "But in so vast a country as Russia, with few means of 
communication, and a dull provincial life, disgrace or advancement was a matter 
of a few kilometres. Removal from one institution to another might involve moral 
and material advantages. Then, at various stages in the hierarchy, the 
particular employment might offer more or less advantages in the present and 
prospects for the future."<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> To these generalities, reflecting a state of 
affairs that was still relatively bearable, but would very quickly worsen, it is 
necessary to dot the i's in order to take account of the harsh conditions of 
which Stalin was able to take advantage in order to subdue acts of disobedience, 
and even simple hesitations, in relation to the "discipline of the party".</p>

<p class="fst">After the death of Lenin, the party was to become personified, 
within a few years, in its General Secretary, through the fault of those who, 
like Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin and others, were soon to complain 
about it. All the leaders Stalin decided to suppress were the creators of the 
"system" whose fatal harmfulness they were to denounce all too late, the system 
whose <i>ultima ratio</i> Khrushchev was to call "the meat-mincer", the grinder 
of human flesh (<i>Khrushchev Remembers: The Last Testament</i>, Boston, 
1971).<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">To have recourse to immutable ideas, fixed once and for all from 
the very start, is to preclude any understanding of the Soviet world, its 
history and its institutions. In fact, the people and structures of oriental 
Communism evolved with disconcerting rapidity after the October coup, under the 
pressure of circumstances, in order to impose themselves upon an entire 
population which was more and more hostile to the "soviet" regime.</p>

<p class="fst">The party that seized power in 1917 was still a Social Democratic 
party: it changed its name, and not only its name, a few months later. Lenin in 
power was not the same as Lenin before he exercised power. Until lately a 
defender of democracy&#8212;the texts are there&#8212;he was to reprove his companions 
who, as good socialists, had abolished the death penalty (November 1917). 
Obsessed by his historical reminiscences, Jacobinism and the Paris Commune, he 
was to advocate the terror. He and those close to him loudly demanded the 
convocation of the Constituent Assembly; they suppressed it with a stroke of the 
pen and <i>manu militari</i> [with military methods]. Etc. Stalin, too, was 
greatly changed by several years of exercising power.</p>

<p class="fst">All this was explained in the six hundred pages of the 
aforementioned book. Here it is a matter of filling a gap, and revealing the 
instrument that allowed Stalin to identify himself with the party, the ultimate 
possessor of historical truth according to Lenin, and according to his disciples 
now and forever the infallible guide of humanity in its progress towards the 
golden age after the world-wide revolution.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">Lenin justifies Stalin's power</a></h3>

<p class="fst">To begin with, it is important to recall that Stalin was at one 
and the same time a member of the party's Central Committee, its Politbureau, 
its Orgbureau (Organisation Bureau), People's Commissar of Nationalities, and 
People's Commissar of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, when he "became" 
(as Lenin put it) the party's General Secretary. This outrageous accumulation of 
positions aroused strong criticisms among the Communist elite, and at the 
Eleventh Party Congress of 1922 Preobrazhensky became their mouthpiece in 
saying: "Is it conceivable that one individual is capable of measuring up to the 
work required by two commissariats, and on top of that the Politbureau, the 
Orgbureau and ten other commissions of the Central Committee?" Lenin personally 
replied to Preobrazhensky, justifying the "immense power" that had devolved on 
Stalin by the "lack of people".<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> He had no doubt forgotten this exchange of 
arguments the following year when he dictated the "testament" that remained for 
so long under the bushel.</p>

<p class="fst">And if this accumulation of positions were not enough, Stalin was 
also invested with his most "responsible" mission, according to the terminology 
of the time and place, that of representing the Politbureau on the "college" of 
the GPU &#8211; in other words, the supreme authority as regards the death penalty. 
Without the least scruple, it was he who gave the party's sanction to the most 
extreme, indeed unjust, repressive measures, which Lenin and Trotsky regarded as 
a regrettable necessity while preferring not to get too closely involved in 
them.</p>

<p class="fst">The intellectuals on the Politbureau were capable of theorising 
the terror; but they needed a hard, insensitive man to put it into effect. In 
Stalin, teamed up with Dzherzhinsky,<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> the technical expert in policing and 
bloodletting, they found a politician fit for the tasks that disgusted them. But 
this still does not explain the secret which transformed the party "of Lenin and 
Trotsky", as it was called at the time, into the party of Stalin.</p>

<p class="fst">This secret lies in one of the commissions of the Central 
Committee to which Preobrazhensky referred in his remarks. It is a matter of a 
commission, or section, which has not passed entirely unnoticed, as several very 
competent authors have mentioned it, but whose functions remain to be explained 
concretely, and whose decisive role in the internal struggle remains to be 
emphasised. In the hands of Stalin it was to be an important cog in the 
"apparatus" which held the party merged with the state in its grip, and which 
controlled the fate of every individual, of every family, and the future of 
everyone. This was not the case at the start of the new regime, but came about 
in the course of the years following the civil war, and with increasing 
harshness during Lenin's illness, and above all after his death. It is not 
sufficient to include it in a description of the apparatus of the Secretariat; 
it is necessary to show it at work, at the service of the General Secretary, 
with the moral and human consequences that flowed from it, as well as the 
political results.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">Stalin's accomplices and victims</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In his important work <i>How Russia is Ruled</i> (Cambridge 
Mass., 1953), Professor Merle Fainsod rightly devoted several passages to one of 
the organs of the Secretariat which had hitherto passed unnoticed: "In 1920 a 
special section of the Secretariat&#8212;<i>Uchraspred</i>, the Account and 
Assignment Section&#8212;was established to control the 'mobilization, transfers and 
appointments of members of the party'."<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> Later: "the <i>Uchraspred</i> 
concentrated first on filling party posts. Appointments to the highest party 
positions came under the jurisdiction of the Orgbureau... The <i>Uchraspred</i> 
rapidly extended its control down through the guberniya or provincial level. By 
the beginning of 1923 its controls reached the uezd, or county level. The report 
of the <i>Uchraspred</i> to the Twelfth Party Congress in April 1923 indicated 
that more than ten thousand assignments had been made in the preceding year. 
Stalin, in his organizational report to the congress, made no effort to conceal 
the range of <i>Uchraspred</i>'s activities; indeed, he revealed that it was 
expanding its jurisdiction into the state apparatus."<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Several of Merle Fainsod's pages ought to be quoted. Here, we 
have to limit ourselves. <i>Orgraspred</i>, <i>Uchraspred</i>'s successor, 
"operated as another powerful lever of control over local party organisations. 
Lazar Kaganovich,<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> the head of this section in 1922 and 1923, was one of 
Stalin's most faithful disciples".<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> A chapter on the Secretariat explains: 
"The key section in the Central Committee Secretariat was the 
Organization-Assignments Section (<i>Orgraspred</i>). It was created in 1924 by 
a merger of the <i>Uchraspred</i> and the old Organisation-Instruction Section. 
The <i>Orgraspred</i> functioned as the cadre office of the Stalinist machine... 
Between the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth Congress, the <i>Orgraspred</i> handled 
the placement of 8761 Party workers... at the Sixteenth congress in 1930, L. 
Kaganovich announced that the <i>Orgraspred</i> had arranged the assignments of 
approximately eleven thousand Party workers in the preceding two years."<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> But 
the description of the monstrous party "machine", the central apparatus, takes 
up about twenty-five pages in Fainsod.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Professor Leonard Schapiro, in his now classic book <i>The 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union</i> (London, 1960), explains it more 
briefly, with a categorical conclusion: "the merger in 1924 of the Assignment 
Department (<i>Uchraspred</i>) and the Department for both Organisation and 
Assignment (<i>Orgraspred</i>) ... immediately became the key department of the 
Secretariat, which concentrated in its hands the entire direction of subordinate 
party organs and the all-important function of making appointments. Its history 
is the story of Stalin's success in controlling the party."<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> This last phrase 
is particularly memorable, but it is necessary to illustrate it.</p>

<p class="fst">A. Avtorkhanov (<i>Stalin and the Soviet Communist Party</i>, New 
York, 1959) mentions Kaganovich at the head of the Organisation and Instruction 
Department, then later of the Organisation and Allocation Department,<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> and 
that's all (the titles <i>Uchraspred</i> and <i>Orgraspred</i> do not allow of 
more accurate translations). Professor Robert C. Tucker briefly mentions <i>
Uchraspred</i>, translated as "Records and Assignments", without according major 
importance to it (<i>Stalin as Revolutionary</i>, New York, 1973).<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> Adam Ulam 
and other biographers pass over the two <i>raspred</i> in silence.</p>

<p class="fst">In a popular article written in 1956, under the title of 
"Stalin's Accomplices", which was to be published in <i>Est et Ouest</i> (No. 
171, Paris, 1 April 1957) the author of the present account asked the question: 
"How was one man, so completely devoid of prestige of any sort at the death of 
Lenin, able to get hold of this extraordinary power of life and death over a 
population of some two hundred million souls and particularly over his closest 
political colleagues, who were his superiors on the intellectual level, and 
moreover the power to degrade them with torture and dishonour the victims?"</p>

<p class="fst">The answer to this question was: "Stalin did not come to power 
all on his own: he had accomplices." Among the latter "in order of importance it 
is Lazar Kaganovich who was to be Stalin's principal assistant and accomplice, 
from 1922, and the chief architect of his extraordinary political fortune. He 
can be considered as a prototype of Stalinism and, on this account, merits 
exceptional attention".</p>

<p class="fst">There follows a summary of the career of this personage. Then, in 
1922, Kaganovich "was chosen as head of the 'Organisation and Instruction 
Section' of the Central Committee, which succeeded <i>Uchraspred</i> (the 
Account and Assignment Section) and became <i>Orgraspred</i>, the Organisation 
and Assignment Section. In this position, invisible to the uninitiated and known 
only to those on the inside of the Soviet state, the existence and still less 
the importance of which were not even suspected by anyone outside, he was to be 
the decisive instrument of Stalin's 'will to power'.</p>

<p class="fst">"In fact, the said section of the Central Committee controlled 
the fate of all the party's functionaries; it placed, displaced and replaced 
them in accordance with considerations which discipline did not allow them to 
question. The position of everyone in the hierarchy depended upon it, as well as 
how near or how far they were in relation to the capital or the major urban 
centres. Thus Stalin, supported by Molotov and assisted by Kaganovich, by means 
of changes, demotions and promotions could render harmless those men of the 
elite who stood in his way, and favour docile mediocrities who were prepared to 
follow him blindly. He thus arranged at will the leading committees, regional 
and local, and then the party conferences and congresses that defeated in 
succession Trotsky and his supporters, Zinoviev and Kamenev and their 
supporters, and Bukharin and Rykov<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> and their supporters, in order to deliver 
them to the arbitrary power of the implacable GPU." Etc.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus Stalin, on the strength of his many positions and by the 
apparently legal means of the <i>Uchraspred</i>, and then of the <i>Orgraspred</i>, 
controlled the conditions of existence of every Communist and their families. 
Trotsky, justifying the militarisation of labour in his <i>Terrorism and 
Communism</i> (1920), had written: "For we can have no way to socialism except 
by the authoritative regulation of the economic forces and resources of the 
country, and the centralised distribution of labour-power in harmony with the 
general state plan. The labour state considers itself empowered to send every 
worker to the place where his work is necessary."<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">All the more reason, then, for the party to assume the power to 
assign to its members, who were subject to additional discipline, the place, 
nature and conditions of their lives ... and of their deaths. And if it is true, 
according to the well-known proverb, that "any imbecile can rule with a state of 
emergency", all the more easily could Stalin, who was utterly devoid of 
principles, impose the idolatrous cult of his sinister personality, with the 
monstrous prerogatives that the party-state of Lenin had conferred upon him.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">Towards "immense" power</a></h3>

<p class="fst">As early as 1920, and therefore under Lenin, clear-thinking and 
courageous party members had protested against the authoritarian procedures that 
amounted to a practice of "exile by administrative means" in order to get rid of 
awkward people. At the Ninth Party Congress (1920) C. Yurenev declared: "one 
person was sent to Christiania, another to the Urals, and a third to 
Siberia."<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> Y. Yakovlev testified that: "The Ukraine has become a place of 
exile. Comrades who are unpopular for whatever reason in Moscow are deported 
there."<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1921, when Riazanov and Tomsky<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a> got the congress of the 
trades unions to adopt a non-conformist motion, they were soon removed. Tomsky 
was dispatched to Turkestan, and Riazanov was sent on a mission abroad. The list 
of people removed in this way in the course of the 1920s would be a very long 
one. Account was still taken of the quality of the men, the services they had 
rendered and the abilities that could be used. But in the war to the knife waged 
by Stalin against all those who stood in his way, after the death of Lenin and 
above all after the tenth anniversary of October, there was no longer any 
question of consideration towards even the most respected Communists. <i>
Uchraspred</i>, and then <i>Orgraspred</i>, on Stalin's orders, operated with 
less and less consideration and more and more severity.</p>

<p class="fst">In a few years there was an end to gilded exiles &#8211; embassies and 
diverse missions abroad. One could no longer speak of the Ukraine, or even of 
the Urals, as a "place of exile". The threat of being transferred to Siberia, 
however legal it may have been, gave cause to reflect to those who might be the 
most sincere oppositionists, but who were little inclined to useless sacrifice. 
For there was Siberia and Siberia &#8211; habitable places, and deprived regions where 
a stay for civilised Europeans was equivalent to a slow death.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Uch-ras-pred</i> ... <i>Org-ras-pred</i> ... The three 
syllables were charged with a dissuasive and persuasive force that could not be 
countered by any argument from the left or right, at least as far as the 
majority of the middle cadres were concerned, who moreover could not understand 
why their traditional leaders had become unworthy of assuming their previous 
responsibilities and suddenly found themselves demoted, eventually disgraced and 
punished, and if necessary handed over to the secular arm.<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> Expulsion from 
the party, at the end of an apparently legal persecution, was equivalent to 
falling into the domain of the GPU, that is, of an arbitrary power without 
limits.</p>

<p class="fst">This was a process that extended over several years, and was tied 
to the intimate history of the regime which was concealed by loud polemics and 
vain pseudo-doctrinal controversies conducted by means of quotations drawn from 
Marx and Lenin. It was a process that cannot be summarised in a few lines. 
Stalin's patient and manifold operations unfolded on several planes and under 
diverse pretexts in order to realise a unique plan: to transform the Leninist 
oligarchy into a Stalinist oligarchy, composed of parvenus personally indebted 
to Stalin for their advancement in the apparatus, for their chances of access to 
the highest levels of the hierarchy in the new social elite, the new class of 
exploiters, privileged people and profiteers.</p>

<p class="fst">In addition to the "immense power" he gained from Lenin, which 
had disturbed the latter too little and too late, Stalin was inclined to a 
"police mentality", as Trotsky put it, which provided his vindictive memory with 
a veritable card index of the political and administrative personnel who had any 
influence. He could use and abuse it according to his most sordid calculations, 
without having to take account of the least of the "checks and balances" on 
which the democratic system of North America prides itself. This card index 
registered all the information, all the misdemeanours, weaknesses, 
denunciations, gossip, dangerous liaisons and compromising relations of members 
of the party "which had no other equal" (as Stalin was to say a little later). 
With an organ like <i>Orgraspred</i> it was possible to influence and manipulate 
proven or potential nonconformists in the name of party discipline, to which, by 
definition, everyone had agreed to submit.</p>

<p class="fst">For several years Stalin was obliged to operate under cover of 
party legality, disposing of the fate of all the recalcitrants by means of the 
two <i>raspred</i>. The details of these schemes would require too long and 
moreover too tedious an account. From a certain point, the "father of the 
people" had no need of any cover, <i>Orgraspred</i> lost the concealed part of 
its reason for existence, and the secret police operated on the verbal or 
written instructions of Stalin or his mafia, sometimes on the basis of a 
telephone call (Svetlana Alliluyeva has provided a striking example).<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a> But 
during the phase of transition to the absolute autocracy it was <i>Orgraspred</i> 
that was charged with translating the wisdom and will of the omniscient party, 
which possessed innate knowledge of where and to what each Communist must submit 
himself in order to serve the new idol, the pseudo-proletarian state incarnate 
in Stalin.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">How the bureaucrats were broken</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Apart from the texts quoted above, notably those of Merle Fainsod 
and Leonard Schapiro, the decisive role of the two <i>raspred</i> has passed 
unnoticed by writers committed to deciphering "the enigma of Stalin". They have 
also explained the rise and the omnipotence of his person by crediting him with 
various imaginary talents, without being able to perceive that he above all 
practised "everything is permitted", as Dostoyevsky<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> feared in advance. 
Bereft of any of the "charismatic" qualities necessary to confer prestige on a 
dictator, Stalin surpassed all his rivals in his basest capacities, in his 
trickery, scheming, lying, cruelty, intrinsic depravity and total lack of 
principles and moral sense. His strength also lay in his absolute contempt for 
the official doctrine that his opponents still clung to. Consciously without 
scruple above all, he was able to make use of the apparatus inherited from Lenin 
and knew how to submit it to his purely personal ambition with the help of the 
irresistible instrument that <i>Orgraspred</i> became in his hands, whose 
effectiveness it is time to show other than by abstract concepts.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us imagine a middle-ranking party functionary, Ivanov, 
suspected of wrong thinking, whose typical case will allow us to reveal the 
hidden reality which the dryness of an organisational diagram would not show. He 
is married, the father of one or two children. He has survived the civil war, he 
wants a rest, and it has taken him years finally to obtain a room for himself 
and his family (the accommodation crisis in the '20s and '30s is unimaginable). 
For some reason or other, or perhaps for no reason at all, <i>Orgraspred</i> has 
sent him to Turukhansk, in the extreme north of Siberia, where the earth never 
thaws and the thermometer falls to -40&#176; in winter. There is no argument about 
it. The party, the embodiment of divine history, needs Ivanov in Turukhansk. He 
has to leave, break his attachments to family and friends, and lead his wife and 
children to vegetate together in misery close to the Arctic Circle, deprived of 
the slightest comfort, of relations, of intellectual resources. This is almost 
equivalent to the most rigorous of the deportations under the old regime.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us imagine this Ivanov's state of mind. He wonders what point 
there is to his misfortune. He thinks about the sad fate of his wife, of his 
children, and perhaps of his parents separated from those close to them. In any 
case, he can do nothing to change what has happened to him. The leaders of the 
Opposition are criticising Stalin over a miners' strike in Britain and the 
revolutionary movement in China.<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a> The rank and file of the party understands 
none of this. Ivanov in Turukhansk, how can he help the British miners or the 
Shanghai coolies? Wouldn't it be better to make a show of supporting the 
leadership, and to recognise the wisdom of Stalin, while waiting for better 
days?</p>

<p class="fst">Such bitter reflections haunt the minds of every political exile. 
Most of the dissidents will end up "capitulating" (that was the expression at 
the time). Besides, hadn't Trotsky said at the Fifteenth Party Conference in 
1926: "Stalin is the foremost man in our party, the most important member; 
without him we would not be able to make up the Politbureau"? Ivanov feels his 
convictions weakening. Soon, one after the other, the leaders of the Opposition 
will rally to the official "line", in the name of the supreme excellence of the 
party. We know the outcome. There will be hundred percent party unity. But that 
will not prevent Stalin, when he decides the time is ripe, from exterminating 
almost all the members of the party of Lenin.</p>

<p class="fst">There are many variants to this schematic survey. Places of 
exile, under every climate, are not lacking in the vastness of the Soviet Union, 
where nature offers <i>Orgraspred</i> an infinite range of means for putting 
pressure on its flock. Transportation to Tadjikistan is preferable to a stay in 
the Altai. Often good comrades intercede to negotiate a submission that is 
apparently honourable. A small number of the intractable hold firm, especially 
those who are not married. Numerous examples could be cited which modify the 
picture. But the end result remains: we saw Stalin "elected" to the Supreme 
Soviet with more than a hundred percent of the vote. More than a hundred 
percent...</p>

<p class="fst">Through the logic of the system, combined with Stalin's homicidal 
fury, the GPU progressively substituted itself for <i>Orgraspred</i> and the <i>
ultima ratio</i> was the "mincer", especially after the assassination of 
Kirov<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a> in 1934 and the horrors that followed it. But Roy Medvedev informs us 
that as early as 1930 Yezhov was appointed as head of <i>Orgraspred</i>, which 
tells us a great deal about what that organ already fashioned by Kaganovich had 
been able to accomplish. When he succeeded Yagoda as head of the secret police 
in 1936, Yezhov surpassed all previous atrocities before being "liquidated" in 
his turn, and Stalin had the cynicism to say to A.S. Yakovlev, the aircraft 
designer: "Yezhov was a rat; in 1938 he killed many innocent people. We shot him 
for that" (quoted from A.S. Yakovlev by Michael Heller and Roy Medvedev).<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a> 
Needless to say, Yezhov was only Stalin's obedient instrument, like his 
predecessor and his successor.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">Lenin and Trotsky forged Stalinism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Soviet state, combining the party and the administration, 
formed a gigantic pyramid of various cells and multiple bureaux under local and 
regional executive committees ranked according to a minutely detailed hierarchy 
from top to bottom under the overall authority of a single centre, the party 
Central Committee, of which the Politbureau and Secretariat were, in principle, 
the executive organs. But as George Bernard Shaw said on one occasion, Stalin 
was confirmed as the secretary of a committee all of whose members he himself 
had appointed so that they could appoint him as General Secretary.</p>

<p class="fst">Under the dominating structure of the party several parallel 
structures were added and intertwined, those of the pseudo-soviets, the 
pseudo-trades-unions, the Communist Youth, the economic institutions and the 
police organisations. These various structures fitted together and were mixed up 
as in an apparently inextricable labyrinth, but one for which the Secretariat, 
its Orgbureau and its <i>Orgraspred</i> (while it still existed) held Ariadne's 
thread.<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a> Privileges of every sort corresponded to all levels of this 
bureaucratic network, notably material advantages that encouraged internal 
rivalries, social climbing and open corruption (housing conditions, cars, 
holidays, "gifts", and special shops forbidden to the people, reserved for the 
beneficiaries of the "nomenklatura", sic). An improbable but real 
superimposition of <i>kom</i> (committees) maintained the system for good or 
ill, i.e. from top to bottom of the scale the plethora of <i>kom</i> (of places, 
districts, towns, provinces and regions) and of <i>ispolkom</i> (executive 
committees) were subordinated to many superior <i>kom</i> that hung over an 
oligarchy about which Lenin spoke quite openly.</p>

<p class="fst">Such was the actual result of the work of the man who, in <i>The 
State and Revolution</i> in 1917, had affirmed that the state must begin to 
wither away on the morrow of the socialist revolution.<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a> It had been created 
in stages to incorporate a refractory population and subject it to the new 
regime. For even the minority who had voted for the Bolsheviks in the elections 
to the Constituent Assembly had not voted for the Cheka and the terror, or even 
for Communism; they thought they were voting for peace, for the distribution of 
land, and for free soviets. To this monstrous etatist construction corresponded 
an aberrant ideology, a verbal pseudo-Marxism, simplistic and caricatural, of 
which Lenin was equally the theoretical and practical creator. Stalin only 
carried to extremes what Lenin had invented, though the latter was sincere in 
his socialist intentions, for which his epigones cared nothing.</p>

<p class="fst">As for Trotsky, anxious to obliterate his former disagreements 
with Lenin, recoiling in the face of the treacherous suspicion of "Bonapartism", 
and haunted by the historical precedent of "Thermidor", he had to rival the 
so-called "Bolshevik-Leninist" orthodoxy of his opponents, whilst denouncing to 
the utmost and quite rightly "the apparatus's system of terror", but in 
circumstances in which this apparatus, of which he was part, was now capable of 
stifling all dissident voices and mercilessly punishing any inclination towards 
dissidence.</p>

<p class="fst">Along with Lenin, Trotsky had contributed to forging the baleful 
myth of the infallibility of the party, in defiance of the real ideas of Marx, 
which were invoked indiscriminately. Both of them, intoxicated by their 
doctrinal certainties, and perched at the top of the bureaucratic-soviet 
pyramid, were ignorant of what was being elaborated in the levels below, 
evincing a lack of awareness that handed over all the levers of command to 
Stalin.</p>

<p class="fst">Such are, in a hasty and necessarily bare outline, the why and 
the how of Stalin's enigmatic career. It is a summary that does not allow us to 
identify, as all too many are inclined to do, the founder of the so-called 
soviet state with its inheritor, so different in their characters and motives, 
without mentioning the rest. When Victor Adler,<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a> teasing Plekhanov,<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a> said 
to him "Lenin is your son", he replied tit for tat, "If he is my son, he is an 
illegitimate one". Lenin could have said the same for Stalin. For the latter was 
not another Lenin. Those who think so are deceiving themselves. But that is 
another story.</p>

<h3><a name="h7">Notes: </a></h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1]</a> Lenin's "Testament" is the name generally given to the two 
documents published as additions to his "Letter to the Congress", on 24 December 
1922 and 4 January 1923. Cf. V.I. Lenin, <i>Collected Works</i>, Vol. 36, pp. 
594-6 (translator's note).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2]</a> Gregory Zinoviev (1883-1936) was the President of the 
Communist International until his removal in 1926. He and Lev Kamenev, 
(1883-1936), were leaders with Trotsky of the Joint Opposition, but capitulated 
to Stalin in 1927. They were both shot after the first Moscow trial. Nikolai 
Bukharin (1888-1938) was the author of works on Marxist theory, and head of the 
Comintern after Stalin ousted Zinoviev. He was the main defendant in the third 
Moscow trial. Yuri Pyatakov (1890-1937) was an economic specialist, and head of 
the regional government in the Ukraine. He was one of the defendants in the 
second Moscow trial (translator's note).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> Lenin's Testament was in fact first published in the <i>New 
York Times</i> in October 1926. On the part played by Eastman and Souvarine in

of the Soviets, and de facto party secretary. Nikolai Krestinsky (1883-1938) was 
party secretary in 1921, and a defendant in the third Moscow trial. Evgeny 
Preobrazhensky (1886-1937), the author of several works on Marxist economics, 
was party secretary in 1919. Leonid Serebriakov (1890-1937) was a member of the 
Bolshevik Secretariat in 1919-1920, and then Deputy Commissar for 
Communications. He was a defendant in the second Moscow trial. Vyacheslav 
Molotov (1890-1986) was one of Stalin's oldest and closest allies. Emelyan 
Yaroslavsky (1878-1943), also an ally of Stalin, as a member of the Presidium of 
the Executive Committee of the Communist International orchestrated Trotsky's 
expulsion in 1927. Vasili Mikhailov (1894-1937) was secretary to the Central 
Committee in 1921-2 (translator's note).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> Valerian Kuibyshev (1888-1935) joined the Russian Social 
Democratic Labour Party in 1903. As an early supporter of Stalin, he was the 
Commissar of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate in 1923-6 who came under so 
much criticism from Lenin (translator's note).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n8" href="#fn8">[8]</a> "Troika" was the name commonly used for the alliance of 
Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev against Trotsky in 1923-5. It is sometimes 
translated as "triumvirate", a mocking allusion to those who shared power in 
Rome after the assassination of Julius Caesar (translator's note).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n28" href="#fn28">[28]</a> David Riazanov (1870-1938) was Russia's foremost Marxist

(translator's note).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n29" href="#fn29">[29]</a> When the medieval Inquisition or other church courts wished

church, it handed over the prisoner to be executed, generally by burning, by the 
secular authorities (translator's note).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n30" href="#fn30">[30]</a> Presumably a reference to <i>Letters to a Friend</i> (London, 
1967), the reminiscences of Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva. Possibly 
Souvarine is alluding to Stalin's use of the secret police to frame and imprison 
one of his teenage daughter's boyfriends of whom he disapproved (translator's 
note).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n31" href="#fn31">[31]</a> Feodor Dostoyevsky (1821-1881) was one of Russia's foremost

(translator's note).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n32" href="#fn32">[32]</a> The Left Opposition criticised Stalin for his handling of the 
British General Strike of 1926, and the second Chinese Revolution of 1927: cf. 
L.D. Trotsky, <i>Collected Writings and Speeches on Britain</i>, Vol. 2, London,

<p class="endnote"><a name="n33" href="#fn33">[33]</a> The assassination of Leningrad Party secretary Sergei Kirov
