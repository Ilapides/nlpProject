<h4>Mr. Revere Reveals</h4>

<p class="fst">If you&#8217;re in the working class or of it you&#8217;re bound to get a headache wading through the boss press. Especially now &#8211; under NRA. The high pressure salesmanship methods of the recovery administration &#8211; always profuse with their great, passionate love for the laboring masses &#8211; are simply overwhelming.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re lucky enough to survive the intoxicating ballyhoo of the front page and the stultifying hypocrisy of the editorials, you will, however, find a good sobering bromide in the financial columns. They usually tell the unadorned truth. They&#8217;re got to. Because they constitute the only part of the paper that&#8217;s actually written for the boss &#8211; minus the ballyhoo and minus the embellishments.</p>

<p>And here is what we found on the financial sheet of the <strong>N.Y. Herald-Tribune</strong> recently:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;With the strong arm of government around the wage earner&#8221;, says a certain C.T. Revere (of the firm of Mund&#8217;s, Winslow, and Potter), &#8220;the labor unions are displaced as guardians of the toiler ... The basic reason for the labor union <em>as we have known it in the past</em> no longer prevails.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This is Mr. Revere&#8217;s government. He speaks of it knowingly. And he is addressing his kind, on the forum of his class. He has no need for camouflage and subterfuges here.</p>

<p>The <strong>Herald-Tribune</strong>, appropriately enough, sums up his remarks in the headline, &#8220;Blow to Unions Seen by Revere in NRA Plans&#8221;. That tells the whole story in a nutshell. And as if he were anticipating the argument of the recent strikes and the big, successful unionization drive, the gentleman from Wall St. adds:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Economic forces (?) work out their solution in inexorable fashion even against the <em>intimidation of the working masses</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">If we know anything at all of economic forces (sic) and if the present widespread and far-flung testimonials of strike militancy mean anything, Mr. Revere may yet discover that there is nothing quite so <em>inexorable</em> as the workers&#8217; march to power, as the economic solution of the <em>working masses</em>.</p>

<p>We might add ... even against all the pious &#8220;class peace&#8221; wishes of the labor fakers and all their persistent servility.</p>

<p>Mr. Revere knows what his class wants and needs, and so does the awakening worker.</p>

<p>The proof? The first plank of <em>nearly every</em> strike action in the growing working class upsurge and the major objective of <em>nine tenths</em> of them has been &#8211; <em>union recognition!</em></p>

<p>That&#8217;s what the workers think of the &#8220;strong arm of government!&#8221;</p>

<h4>* * * *</h4>

<h4>Let Him Whistle</h4>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In Pittsburgh, 3,000 to 5,000 miners, singing as they go, request Carnegie steel workers to join a &#8216;holiday movement&#8217; with 85,000 other steel and mine workers in three states.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Carlyle said: <em>&#8216;Give me the man who sings at his work!&#8217;</em></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;A strike seems hardly a thing to sing about!&#8221; &#8211; <em>Arthur Brisbane</em></p>

<p class="fst">For all of our sympathy with Mr. Brisbane&#8217;s outraged ... esthetics, and in spite of his rather impressive appeal to Carlyle&#8217;s authority, we cannot nevertheless understand why he should begrudge the <em>workers</em> a &#8220;holiday&#8221; &#8211; the <em>bankers</em> only had one of their own not so long ago.</p>

<p>It is only just, and even Carlyle had a warm spot for justice.</p>

<p>Still, if the eminent sage of Hearstdon finds <em>strike</em> holidays &#8220;hardly a thing to sing about&#8221; in his capacity as major share-holder of a profit-mad enterprise, he ought to compose himself as a member of the Fourth Estate.</p>

<p>We can well understand that he cannot sing over a strike. Just let him whistle ...</p>

<h4>* * * *</h4>

<h4>There&#8217;s Gold in Them Thar Hills</h4>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Green Backs Plan for U.S. to Assist Jobless Mine Gold&#8221; &#8211; Newspaper Headline.</p>

<p class="fst">Having clad the employed working class in codes of ermine and led them into the promised land of the New Deal, the great American Labor Leader prepares to bring down a shower of gold manna (or are we getting it mixed up with NRA?) upon their less fortunate brethren, left behind in the wilderness of unemployment.</p>
