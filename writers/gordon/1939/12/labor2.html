<h4>Fourth International&rsquo;s Activity in Germany Confirmed</h4>

<p class="fst">Some time ago, the <strong>Appeal</strong> carried a dispatch quoting a
Paris <strong>Temps</strong> report on Trotskyist action in Berlin. This is
corroborated by a news report in the Copenhagen <strong>Politiken</strong> of
October 26.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;According to information gathered from divers
sources,&rdquo; writes <strong>Politiken</strong>, &ldquo;the German police is
engaged in a widespread raid action against numerous cases of
assassination and acts of sabotage. It has organized in Berlin and in
other large cities patrols composed of S.S. troops and volunteers to
quell disorders resulting from blackouts.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;On a recent night raid, a patrol discovered in the
former Communist strongholds of Berlin <em>batches of leaflets bearing
the insignia of the Red Front and the words: Down with Hitler and
Stalin! Long Live TROTSKY!</em>&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p2" name="p2"></a> 
<h4>Belgian P.S.R. Calls for Fight Against National Unity Gov&rsquo;t.</h4>

<p class="fst">In Belgium, the government of &ldquo;National Unity&rdquo; under
Pieriot and the &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; Spaak is preparing for its
part in the Second World War by instituting a tax program which is to
bring a revenue of some 1,443 million francs. It is by far the most
extensive tax program ever proposed.</p>

<p>Of the 1,443 million, less than 120 million or 8 per cent is to be
levied on the trusts and the inheritances of the wealthy. The balance
of more than 90 per cent, constitutes taxes on matches, tobacco,
coffee, beer, fruit, etc. &ndash; in other words, taxes which place
the burden of the war preparations squarely upon the shoulders of the
working class population of the country.</p>

<p>The reformist Belgian Labor Party, in its official organ, the
<strong>Peuple</strong>, fully approves this plundering program of the
bourgeoisie. In its issue of November 11, it gives the usual social
patriotic grounds for that support:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;In the grave hours which we are now witnessing, it
is necessary to act rapidly. At a moment when public opinion
reproaches the government, although sometimes wrongly, with being too
hesitant, it is desirable that parliament give it at once the means
of facing its responsibilities which are urgently necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The only party in the country which is mobilizing public opinion
against the anti-working class &ldquo;National Unity&rdquo;
government and its tax program is the Revolutionary Socialist Party
(P.S.R.), the Belgian section of the Fourth International.</p>

<p>In its paper, <strong>La Lutte Ouvri&egrave;re</strong> it concludes an
attack on the tax program with the following words:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;At no time has the slogan of the sliding scale of
wages, which is inscribed in the transitional program of the Fourth
International taken on such importance as at present.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;The working masses must give themselves a clear
account that they can no longer depend for their self-defense, upon
the reformist leaders whose whole devotion belongs to big banking and
industrial capital.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;They can rely only on their own action. They must
create their own organs of defense and struggle: Committees of
workers, of the unemployed, of the soldiers. Long live the united
front of all the oppressed for immediate demands which will put an
end to the starvation plans of the capitalist reaction supported by
the leaders of the P.O.B. (Labor Party). Make the rich pay!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p3" name="p3"></a> 
<h4>Moscow Confessions in England: Pollitt and Campbell Recant</h4>

<p class="fst">The Kremlin&rsquo;s old wheel-horses in the &ldquo;democracies&rdquo;
were caught short completely by the Stalin-Hitler pact. Thus, Harry
Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain,
wrote in a pamphlet issued early in September:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The Communist Party is convinced that the people
of Great Britain are united as never before in their determination to
win this war against Fascism and the friends of Fascism in Britain,
and to end the horror and anxiety that have overshadowed Europe since
Hitler came to power ...&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Another Stalinist stalwart of People&rsquo;s Front days, J.R.
Campbell, whipped himself up into such a frenzy over the &ldquo;defense
of Danzig&rdquo; for Polish imperialism, that he saw a &ldquo;Fifth
Column&rdquo; lurking behind the opposition of pacifists to the
government&rsquo;s declaration of war. Thus he attacked the Glasgow
<strong>Forward</strong>, mouthpiece of the centrist Scottish Socialist Party
in the following words:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;No demonstration of the Fifth Column would be
complete without a pacifist contingent and so we find the <strong>Forward</strong>
demanding &lsquo;Should we fight over Danzig&rsquo; (horror of
horrors).&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The final upshot was that Moscow ordered these two to act as
scapegoats when the line was changed. Pollitt was &ldquo;removed&rdquo;
from his post and Campbell was denounced in the C.P. press. Now they
have both confessed in the best style of the Moscow trials. In their
statements (London <strong>Daily Worker</strong>, November 11) the former says
that he &ldquo;played into the hands of the class enemy, and
especially the reactionary Labour leaders, who saw in my attitude the
justification of their own policy of supporting the Chamberlain
Government&rdquo; and the latter, that he &ldquo;slipped into a
position of national defense in an imperialist war, involving
objectively support for our own imperialism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A better characterization of the treachery of their People&rsquo;s
Front politics could not be given even by us. But two questions
remain: (1) Since Stalin was the sponsor of that policy in the first
place, why is there no confession forthcoming from him? (2) Since
both Campbell and Pollitt are now for accepting the &ldquo;peace&rdquo;
offer of Hitler, how long will we have to wait until we get their
confession of &ldquo;playing into the hands&rdquo; of Hitler as well?</p>
