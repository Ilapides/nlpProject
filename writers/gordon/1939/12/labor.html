<h4>How the French Workers Are Mulcted for the War</h4>

<p class="fst">Last week this column gave some general indications of the fact
that the French workers are bearing the brunt of the war economy on
their shoulders and that they are in a state of incipient rebellion
as a result. This week we are in a position to give our readers more
concrete information on this score, as gleaned from illegal organs
that have reached us since then.</p>

<p>The 60-hour week has been established as a minimum, although in
the more important war industries a work week of as much as 72 hours
is in force. Of the minimum 60 hours, 45 hours work is required for
the pay of 40 hours established by an old decree. Taking 10 francs as
an average hourly rate, a worker receives 400 francs for 45 hours
work. The 15 hours supplementary which now make up the 60 hour week
are supposed to be paid at the regular rate, that is, 10 francs for
the average worker. Thus, a worker should get 550 francs for his 60
hours of work.</p>

<p>In actuality, however, here is what happens. One decree,
established since the beginning of the war, levies a 25 per cent tax
on &ldquo;overtime&rdquo; or supplementary hours beyond the 45
originally set. Thus, the average worker gets only 112&frac12; francs
&ldquo;overtime&rdquo; pay instead of 150. Then 4 per cent of the
remaining total salary goes to &ldquo;social insurance,&rdquo; and 2
per cent goes to the government under the Reynaud emergency decree
established before the war, leaving him a total of 482 francs out of
the 550 francs he is supposed to get for 60 hours of work.</p>

<p>But even these 482 francs was deemed too much to give a worker for
the 60 hours he is now required to work. So the war government of
Daladier decided to slap another 15 percent war tax on his wage,
reducing the average worker&rsquo;s pay to some 409 francs. Thus he
is really required to work 60 hours for the same pay as he previously
received for 40 hours work, at the same time that the cost of living
keeps constantly mounting.</p>

<p>This last tax, however, may prove to be the straw that breaks the
camel&rsquo;s back. For, although the 15 per cent has already been
officially decreed, resentment is so widespread that the government
has up to the present refrained from enforcing it.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p2" name="p2"></a> 
<h4>... And How the Prolos Answer in Action</h4>

<p class="fst">At the Lorraine-Dietrich works in Argenteuil, the whole personnel
carried on a strike for several hours, shouting revolutionary slogans
and singing the <em>International</em>. They went back to work only
when the management assured them that the 15 per cent tax would not
be applied there.</p>

<p>At the &ldquo;Compteurs de Montrouge&rdquo; department store, 300
women workers demonstrated for 20 minutes with the same object in
view. Their demonstration met with a similar success.</p>

<p>In the C.A.P.R.A. factory at Courneuve, the bosses announced the
government decree would be effective with the next pay envelope. The
night-shift went on strike. As a result the 15 per cent was not
deducted from their wages. At the &ldquo;Petites Voitures&rdquo;
factory in Aubervilliers, the workers quit one hour earlier, carrying
out a strike action along identical lines. Same result here too.</p>

<p>From the looks of things, the French prolos are not going to take
the war deal there lying down.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p3" name="p3"></a> 
<h4>Need of the Hour: A Revolutionary Party</h4>

<p class="fst">Conditions at the front are not any better for the French
bourgeoisie then they are at the rear. Every bit of information
coming from France is testimony to the fact that a tremendous ferment
is making itself felt in the population as a whole.</p>

<p>When you keep in mind the recent revolts in Czechoslovakia and the
reported disturbances in the Reich you have here a more than ample
explanation as to why &ldquo;all&rsquo;s quiet on the Western Front.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The situation just isn&rsquo;t set for an enthusiastic war. It is
much more ripe for revolutionary action. What is lacking most is the
existence of a firmly-knit revolutionary party.</p>

<p>Here too, however, the trend is becoming more favorable. We learn
from reliable sources that the groups adhering to the Fourth
International in France, which were hitherto divided over tactics
with regard to work inside the Workers&rsquo; and Peasants&rsquo;
Socialist Party (P.S.O.P.), have recently reunited and are carrying
on common activity.</p>

<p>The P.S.O.P. itself has undergone a considerable change. At the
outbreak of the war, the party seemed to have disappeared. Late in
October, however, it began to show signs of life again. Its paper,
Jilin 36, has reappeared as a legal organ. An illegal edition,
mimeographed, is also making the rounds of the Parisian working class
quarters. The leadership of the party has passed over to elements
designated as &ldquo;left-centrists&rdquo;. The freemasons have been
expelled from the organization. It is rumored that included among
those expelled, is Marceau Pivert, former leader of the party.</p>

<p>The Stalinists, who regained a measure of the workers&rsquo;
confidence by their new fake &ldquo;turn&rdquo;, are still paralyzed,
and in spite of their tremendous apparatus and the aid of the G.P.U.,
display hardly more activity than the small revolutionary groups. Of
late, there has been a steady trend of more advanced militants from
their ranks going over to the P.S.O.P.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p4" name="p4"></a> 
<h4>A Note on the Work of Our Belgian Comrades</h4>

<p class="fst">The circumstances surrounding the government&rsquo;s persecution
of our leading Belgian comrades are only now coming to light. It
seems that, at the outbreak of war, a certain Vereecken, the leader
of an ultra-left group which split from our Revolutionary Socialist
Party (PSR) about a year ago, took it upon himself to &ldquo;prepare&rdquo;
the revolutionary vanguard for illegality ... This was done by means
of a mimeographed circular containing detailed instructions which was
mailed, among others, to a list of our comrades which he had
purloined from the PSR when he split.</p>

<p>Naturally, the government, which was looking for just such a
pretext, was greatly relieved of its trouble by this piece of
stupidity. The result was that every leading militant in the country
was instantly picked up. Confronted with the evidence, some of the
comrades arrested found it hard to deny the identity of the
perpetrator before the investigation judges. After being held for
weeks, all the militants arrested, including Vereecken, were finally
released.</p>

<p>Upon his release, Vereecken attempted to provoke a split in the
ranks of the PSR because of the repudiation of his &ldquo;document&rdquo;
by some of the comrades arrested. This attempt fortunately has
failed. At a recent congress held by our Belgian party under the most
difficult conditions, this matter among others was settled
definitively. The &ldquo;illegal circular&rdquo; of Vereecken was
condemned unanimously. The action of those comrades who identified
the circular as hailing from Vereecken was censured. The party swung
into action after the congress, resuming publication of its weekly
organ, the <strong>Lutte Ouvri&egrave;re</strong>, and beginning a vigorous
anti-war campaign in the mining fields and in the industrial cities.
In spite of the initial crisis, brought about by the government
action which has resulted from the stupidity of the ultra-lefts, the
party has remained intact. As a matter of fact, the reports to the
congress even showed a substantial gain in membership, coming mainly
from the ranks of the Stalinists in such centers as Brussels and
Liege.</p>
