<h4>Australian Labor Bucks Conscription<br />
for War in Europe</h4>

<p class="fst">Resistance to the dragooning of youth for imperialist slaughter
goes on in one form or another in all the belligerent countries. It
is only rarely, however, that censorship allows a glimmer of the true
situation to break through to see the light of day.</p>

<p>In Australia, for instance, our comrades of the Communist League
(Fourth International) carried on a vanguard struggle against the
so-called National Register, long before the war started. They
explained patiently that the registration of all man-power by the
government was merely a prelude to conscription. All the opposition
parties, including the Labor Party and the Stalinists, supported the
government then, and ridiculed the idea that Australia was preparing
to conscript youth for war overseas.</p>

<p>When the war broke out, the Menzies Government finally proclaimed
its intention to put conscription into force. However, the <strong>Sydney
Sun</strong>, pro-Government organ, explained on October 23:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;They (the conscripts) will not bleed for Imperial
ambitions or capitalistic advantage. They will simply learn how, if
an enemy attacks their own country, Australia, to put up a good fight
against him, instead of being pitched, untrained, into massacre.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Now we learn that this last shred of deception has been dispensed
with and that an Australian Imperial Force is to be raised and &ldquo;would
proceed overseas early in 1940.&rdquo; This was the announcement made
by Prime Minister Robert G. Menzies in the Australian House on
November 29.</p>

<p>After going along for months in support of the government measures
on the ground of their purely defensive character, the Labor leaders
find themselves hard put to go the whole hog when the naked
imperialist content of the war preparations is revealed.</p>

<p>The <strong>New York Times</strong> of November 30 reports:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;A motion by the leader of the Labor Party, John
Curtin, that Parliament go on record as opposing the dispatch of an
Australian Imperial Force to fight in Europe was defeated today in
the House of Representatives. The government defeated the Curtin
motion by only 33 to 28.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The strong vote for the Curtin motion is indicative of the
tremendous unrest which serves as pressure from the ranks upon the
Labor leaders. The laboring masses have boycotted the National
Register from the first. The voluntary recruitment system initiated
by the government at the outset of the war was a flop.</p>

<p>Whether the Labor skates in Parliament and in official control of
the unions will be able to stem the tide, whether the government will
be able to make use of the pro-Hitlerite treachery of the Stalinists
to derail the workers, is still a matter of conjecture. In their
bi-weekly paper, the <strong>Militant</strong>, our Australian comrades wind up
their exposure of conscription in the following words:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Menzies&rsquo; conscription can be defeated. The
workers are willing to follow a militant lead, as was shown by the
National Register boycott. It is necessary that their opposition be
mobilized and expressed by the medium of mass meetings,
demonstrations and above all, by the enunciation of a clear-cut
anti-capitalist policy.&rdquo; (<strong>The Militant</strong>, November 11,
1939).</p>

<p class="fst">That the Australian Fourth Internationalists are doing their bit
toward mobilizing the workers in this direction is evidenced clearly
by their paper and by the successful mass meetings in Sydney and
Melbourne, which they carry on incessantly despite the war regime.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Comrade Franz Meyer Imprisoned in Antwerp</h4>

<p class="fst">At the beginning of September, our comrade Franz Meyer, member of
the International Communists of Germany (I.K.D.) was arrested in
Antwerp, Belgium.</p>

<p>Comrade Meyer was charged with furnishing anti-war cartoons to the
weekly paper of our Belgian Revolutionary Socialist Party, <strong>La
Lutte Ouvri&egrave;re</strong>, under the name of Holz.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the &ldquo;justice&rdquo; meted out by the
so-called &ldquo;Socialist&rdquo; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paul
Spaak, to a man whose alleged crime is that he puts his art in the
service of the struggle against war. Is Belgian &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;
really in such a poor state of health that it has to resort to the
use of police measures against cartoonists and caricaturists? Is
Spaak&rsquo;s conception of the &ldquo;democratic right of asylum&rdquo;
one in which a refugee artist from Hitler&rsquo;s Germany is to be
subjected to the same type of persecution as in Nazi Germany?</p>

<p>Meyer has been imprisoned since September. What is the accusation
filed against him? Why is he being held incommunicado? What
intentions does the Spaak government have with respect to this
refugee revolutionist? Is this rebel artist to be deported and turned
over to Hitler&rsquo;s hangmen?</p>

<p>Every class conscious worker, every upright writer and artist has
the right to demand an answer from the Belgian &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;
on the case of Franz Meyer.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p3" name="p3"></a> 
<h4>Swedish Section of &ldquo;International Front Against War&rdquo;<br />
at Head of Reaction</h4>

<p class="fst">Stalin&rsquo;s invasion of Finland has called forth a tremendous
reaction in Scandinavia. Sympathy with the attacked Finns reaches
deep into the workers circles. The reactionaries are utilizing the
situation for an attack on civil liberties. In Sweden the Communist
paper <strong>Ny Dag</strong> has been banned and the government has ordered
the press distribution bureau, which has a monopoly over the sale of
papers on the streets and at the kiosks, to stop the distribution of
the paper. Instead of protesting against this unheard-of coup of the
government, the representative in parliament of the Swedish Socialist
Party, Flyg, has become the advocate of even stronger measures. In a
speech at the Riksdag session of December 2, he declared that it was
&ldquo;absurd&rdquo; to grant Swedish democratic rights to the
&ldquo;agents of a foreign power&rdquo; and demanded more appropriate
measures on the part of the government. This adaptation of Flyg to
the moods of reaction is not only cowardly but stupid. For, it is clear that the attacks of
Swedish reaction against freedom of the press will not be halted at
the doors of the Stalinists. Already, the weekly of Ture Nemann,
<strong>Tross allt</strong> (<strong>In Spite of Everything</strong>), has been
confiscated because its criticism of the Hitler regime is &ldquo;too
sharp.&rdquo; Nermann has been hauled into court for that. Flyg is
simply digging his own grave.</p>

<p>Flyg&rsquo;s party is a member of the &ldquo;International Front against
War,&rdquo; the successor of the London bureau. What attitude do
Lovestone, Brockway and Pivert take towards the actions of their
Swedish <em>confr&egrave;re</em>?</p>
