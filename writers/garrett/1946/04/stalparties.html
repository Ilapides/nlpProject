Plenum of the National Committee of the Workers Party by Comrade
Garrett, as a statement of views prepared by way of opening a

voting on the views presented in the document, the Plenum devoted
a lengthy and fruitful discussion session to it, and decided to
initiate an educational discussion in the party on the question.
It is here presented with the full admission of the writer that
the document is far from complete in its investigation of the

<p class="fst">1. Russia emerged from the Second World War as one of its two
principal victors. To the degree that the relations between Russia
and the rest of the world have undergone a significant change has a
change of equal significance developed in the international role of
Stalinism, hence in the role of the Stalinist parties. Bureaucratic
collectivism has extended its domain and military position, and,
coupling its new strength with the crisis of European capitalism, it
has altered the objectives of the Communist Parties to conform more
specifically to the requirements of bureaucratic collectivism as a
unique and uncertain social system.</p>

<p>Stalinism, as the greatest organized threat to socialist mass
action on an international scale, has its well-spring in the Russian
counter-revolution. The defeat of the revolution outside of Russia in
the early 1920&#8217;s, and the consequent isolation of the workers&#8217; state,
produced the reactionary theory of &#8220;socialism in one country.&#8221;
In the wake of this theory and the outrageous international policies
it dictated, a series of terrible defeats were inflicted upon the
revolutionary socialist movement, culminating in its virtual
destruction. Simultaneously, the defeat of the revolution outside of
Russia, and the <em>impossibility</em> of building socialism in one
country, set into motion that chain of historic circumstances which
produced, through the triumph of the counter-revolution in Russia,
the entirely new and unforeseen class state we have described as
bureaucratic collectivism.</p>

<p class="fst">2. During the pre-war years, Russian foreign policy sought to
secure the frontiers of Russia against attack. Thus it cultivated a
reasonably powerful Germany as a mid-continent bulwark against
English, French and American intervention. Thus, too, it reduced the
Communist Parties of the world to border patrols of the Kremlin. The
Stalinist Parties served generally to maintain the <em>status quo</em>
&#8211; either by &#8220;respectability&#8221; or by the threat of
provoking revolutionary actions, according to which best suited the
purposes of the Kremlin in its relations with any given country.</p>
<p>In its new position of continental colossus, and conqueror, Russia
no longer needs an independently strong Germany. And by the same
token it is able to direct the Stalinist Parties towards perspectives
more intimately in accord with the ideology and objectives of
bureaucratic collectivism. We are therefore compelled to amend our
evaluation of international Stalinism in order to bring this
evaluation up to date with the new developments.</p>

<p>As Trotskyists, we have traditionally described the Stalinist
Parties as agents of the Kremlin or as social patriots executing the
role assigned them by the Russian foreign office. However, accepting
the reasoning of comrade Trotsky, we also predicted that under the
momentum of social patriotic policy first dictated by Stalin&#8217;s needs
the Stalinist Parties would become indep.endently and permanently
social patriotic, regardless of what subsequent orders came from
Stalin. That is to say, we predicted that the Stalinists in America,
once embarked on the roal of social patriotism, would end their
subservience to Stalin and remain a social patriotic party. Facts,
however, have proved us in error. In reviewing the general
correctness of our evaluation of Stalinism and, in arriving at a new
evaluation of Stalinism, we are obliged to discard what has been
proved wrong, and to add what is new.</p>

<p>Doing that, we arrive at the following evaluation:</p>

<p class="fst"><em>The Stalinist Parties are an internationally organized
ANTI-SOCIALIST and ANTI-CAPITALIST force whose aim it is (a) to
defend and extend the power of the Russian ruling class, and (b)
where class relations in the capitalist countries make possible the
development of Stalinism into a mass movement with decisive
influence, to overthrow capitalism and replace it by bureaucratic
collectivism.</em></p>

<p class="fst">3. It is no more possible for bureaucratic collectivism than for
socialism to establish a more or less historically permanent
stability on a national scale. Bureaucratic collectivism therefore
seeks to create for itself international conditions of stability in
economy and politics (as did capitalism in its day, as will the
proletarian dictatorship in its day). At one stage, while the new
ruling class is taking shape, and general international conditions
require it, it is the exclusive duty of the Stalinist Parties to
defend Russia by compromise with the bourgeoisie or by militant
action. With Russia&#8217;s new strength as a war victor, and in the
complex of capitalist instability, conditions arise for the extension
of bureaucratic collectivism by defeating both the capitalist class
and the working class. This development manifests itself on different
levels, depending upon the degree of capitalist convulsion and the
relationship of class forces in any given country.</p>

<p>In the Baltics and in parts of the Far East bureaucratic
collectivism has imperialistically spread its rule through military
conquest and outright territorial acquisition. In Yugoslavia, Tito&#8217;s
puppet government is establishing bureaucratic collectivism through
liquidation of the native ruling class and suppression of, the
masses. In France, the situation has sufficiently developed to
disclose the objectives of Stalinism, although the issue is far from
having risen to the point of decision. In the United States, where
capitalism enjoys a relatively greater stability, and where the CP is
still far from the mass movement it must become to effectuate its
role, its activities and objectives are necessarily restrained to the
traditional framework of simple service to the Russian ruling class.</p>
<p>The objective condition for the development of Stalinism in the
capitalist countries is the inability of capitalism to reestablish
any kind of organic stability, the bankruptcy of the old ruling class
and the disruption of the socialist movement. In France the social
system has reached a degree of disequilibrium, and the Stalinists a
degree of mass influence, to make it possible for them to consider,
however distant it may at the moment be, the question of power. To
take power, Stalinist reaction must simultaneously engage in the
defeat of the capitalist system, and in the destruction of the
socialist movement. Thus the issue there (omitting for the present
vital international considerations) can only be decided by the
outcome of the class struggle, principally the destruction of the
proletarian movement through actual combat or absorption. And there
is the great obstacle to Stalinist triumph.</p>

<p>In making our analysis of the new phenomenon of bureaucratic
collectivism in Russia we carefully avoided predictions as to the
ultimate stability and duration of this historical monster. For that,
we said (and must again repeat), is an issue that can only be decided
in the actual development of the class struggle. So especially is
this true of its international aspirations as a social system. <em>It
has not yet won a single major class battle outside of Russia.</em> It
has strengthened its power tremendously through annexation or puppet
rule, but it has not yet triumphed as a system of class rule over any
significant proletariat or bourgeoisie &#8211; as capitalism triumphed
over feudalism &#8211; despite its tremendous forces and reserves.
Stalinism, sweeping to power in France, would change the character of
our epoch. Precisely for that reason, it would find itself embroiled
in actual combat with Britain and America should it take any serious
steps towards exclusive state power and war with American imperialism
is certainly far from Stalin&#8217;s, desire, or capacity today. Stalinism
has won a victory in Yugoslavia, but Yugoslavia is far distant in the
scale of historical decision from the class forces that would have to
be defeated in France. And there is no reason to believe that over
there is has entirely crushed the resistance of the workers and
peasants who were deceived by Tito and will yet seek to throw off the yoke.</p>

<p class="fst">4. Unlike all other reactionary movements we have known, Stalinism
has a mass base in the working class. This is a point of extreme
significance. Stalinism is able to appear as the champion of the
working class precisely because its object is to destroy capitalism
as well as to enslave the proletariat. It <em>does propose</em> to
nationalize property. However, nationalized property without
political control of the working class is, as we have learned, not
socialism, but bureaucratic collectivism. The nationalized property
belongs to the state, the state belongs to the bureaucrats, and the
proletariat continues to be exploited as a class.</p>

<p>In executing its first duty, defense of the Russian ruling class,
the Stalinist Party may and often does (as it has in the United
States) support bourgeois parties and engage in obvious anti-working
class actions. Similarly, it may instigate and support working class
action, against capitalism (a) as a threat against anti-Russian
policy (for example in the United States today), or (b) to make
headway among the working class so that it can improve its
effectiveness as an agent of Russian Stalinism, and, at a later stage
strike out more boldly on its path towards bureaucratic collectivism.</p>

<p>Stalinism is totalitarian, but it is a peculiar kind of
totalitarianism. It is, at once, anti-socialist and anti-capitalist;
and it attracts the working class. Stalinism understands the meaning
of the class struggle. It understands that it must have the
intervention of the working class to defeat capitalism. Attracting
the working class through its anti-capitalist appeal, it utilizes the
working class for its own reactionary ends. Thus, <em>the Stalinist
parties are not working class parties</em>, but totalitarian parties
with a mass base in the proletariat. They do not advance the cause of
the proletariat in any sense whatsover, not even in the limited sense
in which the reformist parties are compelled to do solely their very
nature and historical function.</p>

<p>While it derives its mass base from the working class, a
symptomatic source of Stalinist recruitment and ideological direction
is the labor bureaucrat, the declassed intellectual and middle class
professional who see no way out of the dilemma of capitalism save
through Stalinist rule. Together, all these form a significant social
grouping in the Stalinist Parties. Certain labor bureaucrats whose
interests clash with sinking capitalism precisely because their
position rests on labor, see the possibility of retaining their
privileged position in the much higher level of Stalinist rule.
Scientists, professors, literati, middle class elements of all kinds
face the impossibility of capitalism, and see in the Stalinist
organization of a planned economy an opportunity to save themselves,
to exercise their skills under conditions of extreme social
privilege. While policy does not emanate from this group (it
generally comes from the Russian bureaucracy), they nevertheless
influence it in the sense that they form a top social layer or
grouping whose interests are most adaptable to bureaucratic collectivism.</p>

<p>The Stalinist game is a completely reactionary game which can only
end in disaster for the proletariat if successful. Should they gain
complete ascendancy in such a country as France, through decisive
influence over the working class and state rule, they would bind the
working class in a bitter totalitarian vise. The class struggle would
continue and eventually triumph, but only after doubly severe, doubly
hard sacrifices had been imposed on the working class. We cannot,
therefore, give any kind of support to Stalinism, either electorally
or otherwise. Because of the peculiar nature of this reactionary
movement we may sometimes have to enter into certain forms of
collaboration with it (as in certain strikes or unions they control).
But we must relentlessly wage warfare, class warfare against
Stalinism, as we wage it against capitalism. Whether this involves
working among the genuinely proletarian elements it has sucked into
its movement, or attacking it from the outside, our obligation
remains the same: to expose the Stalinist parties as anti-working
class, to destroy their, influence.</p>

<p class="fst">5. Because bureaucratic collectivism has spread its wings, it by
no means signifies that the issue is thereby settled. Neither
history, nor the, working class have yet yielded. We have said that
it is the historical duty of the working class to defeat
international capitalism, to create its proletarian dictatorships
that will usher in the next stage of world history, socialism. That
is still our view, it is still the key to our entire program.
Capitalism has created the conditions which make it possible for
humanity to advance to a higher social order through proletarian
conquest. Should bureaucratic collectivism triumph universally, it
would have proved that the proletariat was incapable of organizing
for power in this period, that unable to take power from collapsing
capitalism it had to yield for a period of uncertain duration to a
new system of exploitation into which history had been deflected from
its natural course. But that is a long way from being established.
Socialism is still the first point on today&#8217;s historical agenda.</p>

<p>A combination of unusual circumstances &#8211; the usurpation of power
by a bureaucracy in a country where the proletariat had already
defeated capitalism &#8211; gave birth to the monstrosity of bureaucratic
collectivism. Impulses toward bureaucratic collectivism exist in the
capitalist countries, notably among those who would free themselves
of capitalist chaos and still retain a privileged position in
society. But that is all. Stalinism has not yet so completely
fastened itself on the proletariat that it can bend it to its
bureaucratic will. It has one advantage: the absence of an organized
socialist movement of mass proportions. Therein lies the weakness of
the proletariat. Therein is Stalinism&#8217;s great opportunity.</p>

<p>The class struggle, however, continues. The socialist movement can
be regenerated. Inside and outside the Stalinist parties are the
proletarians who, once again organized in a revolutionary party,
under the inspiration and activity of a program that speaks their
needs, not only can but will fight the class struggle against
capitalism and against Stalinism. Stalinism is already beset by
opposition in Yugoslavia. Mass resentment must run high in the
countries it has annexed as well as in Russia. There are signs of a
declining influence in France. Vast numbers of French workers are
outside the Stalinist movement and are socialist in consciousness. In
the United States, the Stalinists are nowhere near having decisive
mass influence. A defeat visited upon Stalinism in such a country as
France would have its immediate repercussions elsewhere. The
reconstitution of a mass socialist movement in France, or the United
States, would sound the death knell of Stalinism and capitalism
equally. That is our unrelinquishable need, our greatest obligation:
the building of the revolutionary party.</p>
