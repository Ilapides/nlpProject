<p class="fst">It was with great sadness that Socialist Party members and trade
unionists across South Wales received the news that Andrew Price had
passed away following a serious chest infection.</p>
<p>Our heartfelt condolences go out to his wife Enid, children
Rachel, Philip and Michael, and grandchildren Josh, Sam, Jack and Liam.</p>
<p>Andrew was an inspirational figure who overcame chronic ill health
to continue to play a leading role as one of the most militant
leaders of the South Wales labour movement.</p>
<p>He was a great orator, a tenacious fighter and a stalwart of the
Socialist Party and its predecessors the Militant Tendency and
Militant Labour.</p>
<p>As such he was hated by the right wing of the labour movement who
responded with relentless and often spiteful attacks (the right wing
vetoed a vote in Splott ward Labour Party to send Andrew a get well
card following his stroke).</p>
<p>But Andrew rose above those attacks, reinforced by an unwavering
conviction in the correctness of Marxist ideas and the eventual
victory of the working class.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Early life</h4>
<p class="fst">Andrew was born in Pontypridd, one of four sons, before his family
moved to Cardiff while he was still a young boy.</p>
<p>Andrew grew up a real Cardiffian before returning to Pontypridd
and going to Aberystwyth university in 1967.</p>
<p>In Pontypridd Andrew joined the Labour Party Young Socialists, the
beginning of nearly 50 years of labour movement activity.</p>
<p>In 1968 he was convinced of Marxist ideas and joined Militant, at
that time a small tendency within the Labour Party.</p>
<p>In 1969 he was one of the first <strong>Militant</strong> supporters to be
elected onto the National Committee (NC) of the Labour Party Young
Socialists (LPYS) and contributed in no small measure to the success
in 1970 of <strong>Militant</strong> gaining a majority on the LPYS NC, a
majority never relinquished until the right wing under Neil Kinnock
effectively closed the LPYS in 1989, after all attempts at
engineering a political defeat of Militant had failed.</p>
<p>It was at an LPYS meeting in Cardiff in 1968 that Andrew met Enid
Phillips. At that meeting Andrew and Enid were in different political
trends &#8211; Enid was a supporter of <strong>Tribune</strong>, the left reformist
paper of the Labour Party &#8211; but they still fell for each other.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of a life-long partnership of deep mutual
love and dedication. In later years the Price household, the most
political in Tremorfa, appeared from the outside to be the least
politicised as Andrew and Enid agreed to display neither Labour nor
Socialist Party posters in their window!</p>
<p>In 1971 Rachel their daughter was born, followed three years later
by twins Michael and Philip. Andrew was a devoted father, and later
grandfather, combining his dedication to his family with his
commitment to the struggle to change society.</p>
<p>The 1970s was a period of heightened class struggle against the
Tory Heath government which Andrew participated in.</p>
<p><strong>Militant</strong>&#8217;s ideas were gaining an increasing echo and he
played a prominent role in the Cardiff Trades Union Council which he
continued until the end.</p>
<p>The election of a Labour government was viewed with great
expectation by the working class, but it was led by the right wing
who attempted to balance support from the trade union movement with
carrying out the dictates of big business.</p>
<p>Andrew clashed in the Cardiff South East CLP (constituency Labour
Party) with a leader of the government, Jim Callaghan, who was first
foreign secretary, then prime minister.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Labour Party witch hunt</h4>
<p class="fst">Led by the Tory press, the right wing began a campaign against
&#8220;Trotskyist infiltration&#8221; in Cardiff South East Labour Party.</p>
<p>For 13 years Andrew, together with other <strong>Militant</strong>
supporters, especially Dave Bartlett, fought tooth and nail repeated
attempts to expel him from the Labour Party, all of which failed
until Andrew was struck down with a stroke in 1988.</p>
<p>Reminding anyone who would listen that it was Marxists who helped
form the Labour Party, Andrew fought every attempt to get him out of
Cardiff South East Labour Party and off Callaghan&#8217;s CLP General
Management Committee (GMC).</p>
<p>After the right wing mobilised at Splott ward&#8217;s AGM to vote
Andrew off the GMC, Andrew remembered that the Socialist Education
Association (SEA), of which he was a member, was affiliated to
Cardiff South East Labour Party and so got delegated from the SEA.</p>
<p>His right wing opponents were seething as Andrew took his seat at
the next GMC meeting. When the right wing responded by mobilising
dozens of right wingers from all across Cardiff to join the SEA in an
attempt to unseat him, Andrew and Dave Bartlett responded by signing
up dozens of left wingers.</p>
<p>The normally sleepy SEA was surprised to see its Cardiff branch
mushroom into the biggest in the country! Under Andrew&#8217;s leadership
the Cardiff SEA became not just a battleground with the right wing
but one of the best venues in Cardiff for socialist discussion and
debate with many outside speakers invited to speak on educational and
socialist issues.</p>
<p>The campaign against <strong>Militant</strong> supporters in Cardiff South
East was very personal and occasionally violent, but he never once
faltered, maintaining a principled support for <strong>Militant</strong> and
Marxist ideas and refusing to stoop to the personal and petty levels
of his opponents.</p>
<p>The attacks from the right wing did not prevent Andrew from
winning wide support from the labour movement in South Wales.</p>
<p>In 1980 he even managed to be elected as the delegate from Cardiff
South East CLP to Labour Party national conference and took great
delight in reporting back how he voted in the conference to the right
wing at the GMC.</p>
<p>He was short-listed as Labour parliamentary candidate in
Caerphilly, Torfaen and Cardiff Central constituencies, only missing
out in Cardiff Central by a handful of votes to another left winger
in1982.</p>
<p>In 1985 eventually the right wing in Cardiff South Labour Party
voted to expel Andrew along with Dave Bartlett and Diane Mitchell.</p>
<p>Andrew used the attack as a platform to campaign against the witch
hunt and for the ideas of Marxism in the labour movement, travelling
all over the country speaking at Labour Party meetings and raising
funds for the Cardiff South Defence Fund.</p>
<p>The Cardiff South three successfully won an injunction against the
right wing for unconstitutionally railroading the expulsions through.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Dedication to labour movement</h4>
<p class="fst">Andrew played a prominent role in the South Wales labour movement
in the struggles against the reactionary Thatcher government.</p>
<p>During the miners&#8217; strike of 1984&#8211;5 Andrew was seen on many
picket lines in support of the miners, and when the picket lines were
attacked by the police he was often seen where the fighting was at
its thickest.</p>
<p>Andrew was also a staunch defender of <strong>Militant</strong>-led
Liverpool council, organising support meetings in Cardiff.</p>
<p>In 1988 Andrew suffered a serious stroke that partially paralysed
his left side. His disability made movement very difficult, but aided
by Enid, he insisted on returning to work and continuing his
political activity.</p>
<p>For the rest of his life Andrew refused to allow his disability to
prevent him playing a full role in the labour movement and as a
teacher. This would not have been possible without the huge day to
day and moral support he received from Enid for the remaining 26
years of his life.</p>
<p>He had already come to the conclusion that the undemocratic
changes to the Labour Party had made it increasingly difficult to
change it and that it was better to build support for Marxism outside
the Labour Party and for him to concentrate on the wider struggle.</p>
<p>In 1989 Margaret Thatcher gave him a golden opportunity with the
poll tax. Andrew threw himself into the struggle and soon clashed
again with the right wing Labour councillors who decided to implement
Thatcher&#8217;s poll tax.</p>
<p>He helped set up Splott anti-poll tax union and when summoned to
court for non-payment Andrew stood his ground and defied the
magistrates.</p>
<p>Andrew&#8217;s deep personal loyalty was sorely tested when the
<strong>Militant</strong> leadership split in 1991 mainly over the issue of
staying in the Labour Party.</p>
<p>But despite being telephoned a number of times by leaders of the
small minority faction who wished to remain in the Labour Party,
Andrew supported the position of the majority who realised that
Labour was becoming a party wedded to capitalism in which the voice
of the working class was silenced.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Teacher and trade unionist</h4>
<p class="fst">Andrew had begun teaching sociology at Rumney Tech in 1971 and for
the next 38 years was an inspiring teacher to thousands of further
education students.</p>
<p>Many times he would be sought out on street stalls by former
students who were grateful for his dedication and patience.</p>
<p>And Andrew was also a great union organiser in the college
lecturers&#8217; union, NATFHE (now part of UCU), serving for many years
on its Wales and UK executive committees.</p>
<p>Over the years he was an uncompromising negotiator on behalf of
union members at his college and as a Wales negotiator with the Welsh
college employers.</p>
<p>With Andrew as one of the FE leaders, Wales was one of the most
combative parts of NATFHE and Welsh FE lecturers led by Andrew
secured the best pay and employment deals in Britain, including pay
parity with teachers that served as an aim for lecturers in England.</p>
<p>Even after retiring Andrew continued to play an important role at
the Cardiff Trades Union Council, UCU Wales Retired Members branch
and at the Wales TUC conference, at this year&#8217;s conference
powerfully condemning the bedroom tax.</p>
<p>Andrew was a tremendous orator, always speaking clearly and was
able to speak colourfully but also directly, telling it like it is.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Later years</h4>
<p class="fst">Despite being one of the oldest members of the Socialist Party in
Wales Andrew had a special relationship with the youngest members.</p>
<p>One recalls:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;A fountain of knowledge in the local Socialist Party
branch he would answer every question and take time to speak to an
annoying teenager (me) at every meeting and activity.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Another recalls:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Andrew became my comrade and friend but he never
stopped being my teacher. He was an inspiration to all around him.
The struggles he endured, the respect he had amongst his peers and
younger generations. Always willing to patiently explain &#8211; many
times too patiently to the annoyance of other comrades. Always
entertaining to sit down and have a pint with.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">One young member insisted in remaining in Andrew&#8217;s party branch
even though she didn&#8217;t live in the area, so that she could hear his
contributions in the political discussions.</p>
<p>After leaving the Labour Party Andrew dedicated himself to arguing
the need for a new mass workers&#8217; party.</p>
<p>He understood that this was the main political task for the trade
union movement. Labour Party supporters in the trade unions sometimes
tired of his interventions, but Andrew understood that this issue was
central for the working class to defend itself against the capitalist onslaught.</p>
<p>Andrew also understood that building support for socialist ideas
was crucial as well. He never missed a Socialist Party branch meeting
except for illness or holiday, even though he had more reason than anyone.</p>
<p>He understood that finance was vital to our success and was an
inspiring and determined finance organiser. He was the best district
treasurer Wales Socialist Party ever had. In 1987 he and Chris Peace
organised a sponsored bike ride to raise money for the fighting fund.</p>
<p>In later years he did not allow his disability to prevent him from
repeating the feat, this time on an adapted bike.</p>
<p>For three years anyone who attended an anti-cuts meeting or a
trades council meeting was gently &#8220;persuaded&#8221; to sponsor Andrew.
In two years he raised over &#0163;1,000, which was paid into the
financial appeals at Socialism 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p>This year Andrew will not be here to repeat his ride, but some
sponsor money has already been collected.</p>
<p>Socialist Party Wales is setting up an Andrew Price memorial fund
with a target of &#0163;2,000 to ensure Andrew&#8217;s 2014 efforts are not wasted.</p>
<p>For decades Andrew inspired enormous respect and affection, even
from opponents, because he had absolute integrity.</p>
<p>He was dedicated to changing society and convinced that the
working class, the ideas of Marxism and the methods of the Socialist
Party and CWI are the only means by which we can achieve that.</p>
<p>His example is an inspiration to generations of socialists and
although he has passed away, his memory lives on in the minds of
generations of socialists, who are proud to have known Andrew and
shared in his battles. He will be sorely missed and never forgotten.</p>
