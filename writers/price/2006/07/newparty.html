largely drawn from South Wales, met in Cardiff on 29 June to
launch the Campaign for a New Workers Party (CNWP) in Wales.</strong></p>

<p class="fst">From the platform Rob Williams (T&amp;GWU), convenor of the Visteon
Car plant in Swansea,described the current struggle to protect jobs
in the works given New Labour&#8217;s total failure to stem the loss of
jobs in manufacturing throughout the country.</p>

<p>Alex Gounelas (USDAW) explained how very few youth in Britain had
any political memories before the rise of New Labour, and how they&#8217;d
suffered as a result of the government&#8217;s policy in spheres such as
low pay and education. Young people could be enthused by the prospect
of a new workers&#8217; party in the same way that they were enthused by
the struggle against the war with Iraq.</p>

<p>John McInally (PCS NEC) condemned the huge Civil Service job
losses caused by this government&#8217;s policies, and the massive
privatisation brought about by New Labour in the same area. The call
for a new workers&#8217; party is in tune with the aspirations of many
public sector trade unionists today.</p>

<p>On the same day that Blaenau Gwent voters delivered a damning
verdict on New Labour, this meeting showed what the campaign can and
will do throughout Wales in the next period.</p>
