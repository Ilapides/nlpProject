<p class="info">From <strong>Socialism Today</strong>, No.&nbsp;164, December 2012/January 2013.<br/>
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">I read with great interest Dave Gorton&#8217;s article on the fortieth
anniversary of the stand of Clay Cross council against the Tory
Housing Finance Act (<strong>Socialism Today</strong>, No.&nbsp;163, November
2012).</p>
<p>I was one of the generation of Marxists campaigning in South Wales
at the time in support of the councillors. This involved me in
helping to organise a successful public meeting in Cardiff addressed
by Clay Cross councillor David Skinner and confronting within Cardiff
South East Constituency Labour Party (CLP) the local MP James
Callaghan, a right-wing Labour opponent of the council.</p>
<p>In 1972 I attended a huge conference in Cardiff on the Housing
Finance Act organised by the South Wales National Union of Miners
(NUM). On the platform was a young newly-elected Labour MP from the
South Wales coalfields masquerading as a left winger. Eloquently he
denounced the entire Tory Act but was then asked by a miner to
support the type of action favoured by councillor Skinner referred to
in Dave&#8217;s article. He refused but his weasel words were drowned by
the loud booing of practically everybody present. His name? Neil
Kinnock.</p>
<p>Twenty-three years later Kinnock famously denounced a similar
stand against the Tories by the Labour group of Liverpool city
council, led by <strong>Militant</strong> supporters (the forerunner of the
Socialist Party).</p>
<p>The Liverpool and Clay Cross councillors joined those from Poplar
in the 1920s in becoming part of the living traditions of the labour
movement. Their names will be remembered long after those of
political pygmies like Callaghan and Kinnock are forgotten.</p>
