<p class="fst">Dear comrade,</p>

<p class="fst">I was horrified to read reports that the new hard right majority
on Labour&#8217;s National Executive Committee intends to carry out
attacks on the Labour Party Young Socialists.</p>

<p>Presumably Dennis Howell, John Golding and other witch-hunters on
the NEC don&#8217;t like the present leadership of the LPYS. The fact
that this leadership is supported by the overwhelming majority of
LPYS members, and that this leadership has succeeded where others
have failed in building a mass LPYS are small details to these
witch-hunters, as their purge gathers its own momentum.</p>

<p>From 1965 to 1970 the LPYS had a stooge leadership imposed on them
by a constitution drawn up by Reg Underhill (yes he was at it in
those days as well). This leadership, whose ideas would be applauded
by Denis Howell today, was as representative of LPYS opinion as John
Golding is of CLP opinion today.</p>

<p><strong>Militant</strong> led the fight to democratise the LPYS, and when in
1970 the LPYS was eventually allowed to elect its own National
Committee <strong>Militant</strong> supporters won a majority.</p>

<p>In 1970, I spoke at a national demonstration organised by the
LPYS. As I recall around 500 youth were in attendance. A few weeks
ago I marched with the LPYS from my own CLP in a demonstration of
over 8,000 youth in Liverpool.</p>

<p>On the South Wales train there were over 300 young people. Many of
them were new to politics, but by the end of the day all of them had
been signed up for the LPYS and the Party. This demonstration was a
magnificent tribute to the dedication of those young comrades who
lead the LPYS, nationally and locally.</p>

<p>In the mid 1960&#8217;s when I joined the LPYS I remember Frank Field
being active in the YS. Presumably he remembers a pathetically small
organisation, incapable of campaigning on youth issues, a leadership
totally repulsive to any self-respecting youth, and a tiny movement
policed by Underhill and Bessie Braddock. Is this what this erstwhile
&#8216;left&#8217; MP wants a return to when he calls for the suspension of
the LPYS leadership?</p>

<p>Capitalism has sentenced million of our youth to a life sentence
on the dole. More than ever before the Party needs a strong youth
movement. In the unlikely event of Howell, Golding, Field and company
getting their way in their proposed purge of the youth &#8211; the ranks
of this movement will never forgive this abject betrayal.</p>
