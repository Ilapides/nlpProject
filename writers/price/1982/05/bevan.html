<p class="fst"><strong>The life of Aneurin Bevan whose political battles have
important lessons for the labour movement today was the subject of a
recent BBC TV play by Paul Ferris.</strong></p>

<p>Born in Tredegar, South Wales in 1897 Bevin&#8217;s early involvement
with the labour movement was as a syndicalist fighting to stamp out
company unionism and establish the South Wales Miners Federation. He
became more involved in political struggles after the defeat of the
1926 General Strike.</p>

<p>During the 1930s as MP for Ebbw Vale Bevan brilliantly
demonstrated how a socialist should use parliament as a platform to
express the anger of the mass unemployed. In the 1945 Labour
Government Bevan was responsible for introduction of the National
Health Service. In the 1950s he was the centre of a witch-hunt
organised by the right wing who wanted to expel him and his
supporters from the Party.</p>

<p>Unfortunately having seen Gaitskellism defeated at rank and file
level in the movement towards the end of his life Bevan sought a
compromise with the right wing. He shattered the faith many of his
supporters had in him when he changed his position on nuclear weapons
in favour of Gaitskell&#8217;s.</p>

<p>This play could have been the subject of a serious analysis of any
of these themes. It could have sought to explain to the generation to
whom Bevan was only a name the battles he fought on their behalf.</p>

<p>The play did come of this. Indeed he dealt with the major
political questions in a largely superficial manner, sometimes being
more concerned about gossip about Bevan than in his political ideas.</p>

<p>One partial exception was the establishment of the National Health
Service. Here the mass support this important reform received was
well portrayed as was the selfish and reckless attitude of the
British Medical Association.</p>

<p>Yet the play failed to even mention the tooth and nail opposition
of the Tories to the NHS and their full support for the
extra-parliamentary opposition of the BMA. The play did, however,
bring out Bevan&#8217;s insistence that the Health Service should be free
and that private practice should only continue on a temporary basis.
The present devastated condition of the Health Service with the
scandal of private medicine flourishing would horrify Bevan if he
could see it today.</p>

<p>The stormy events of the 1950s in which the Gaitskellites, who
enjoy a majority in the Parliamentary Party, attempted to purge the
constituencies of Bevanite support was subjected to very poor
treatment. At its best the play portrayed the dispute as a clash
between the middle class and working class in the Party; at its worst
to a personality clash between Gaitskell and Bevan.</p>

<p>The fact that Bevan was nearly expelled from the Party, that CLPs
were closed down, that the right wing could only resort to
organisational measures to defeat the political arguments of the
Bevanites were all left out.</p>

<p>Some of those who supported the moves to expel Bevan in the 1950s
now favour organisational measures against <strong>Militant</strong>
supporters. Both Callaghan and Healey supported the expulsion of
Bevan in the 1950s. That is why those who did not experience these
battles should study actually what happened. Unfortunately Ferris&#8217;s
play largely failed to explain any of the mighty events in Bevan&#8217;s life.</p>
