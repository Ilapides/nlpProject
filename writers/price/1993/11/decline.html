<p class="fst"><strong>Capitalism, Culture and Decline in Britain, 1750&#8211;1990</strong><br/>
by W.D. Rubinstein<br/>
<em>Published by Routledge, 1993, &#0163;25 hb</em></p>
<p class="fst">In our economic analysis of world capitalism, <strong>Militant</strong> has
explained the reasons for the massive economic boom from roughly
1950&#8211;1975 and how the system has since moved to periodic slumps and
booms. Within the general crisis of world capitalism, however, there
are special features of the crisis of British capitalism, which has
witnessed the massive decline of Britain as an industrial nation.</p>
<p>The recent book by W.D. Rubinstein, an Australian academic, is a
contribution to this debate on the decline of British capitalism.
However I cannot conclude that he has helped us understand the
process any more clearly.</p>
<p>Rubinstein devotes the largest part of his work to a string attack
on what he calls &#8216;the cultural critique&#8217;. This argument traces
the massive growth of British industry post-1760 leading to the
establishment of Britain by 1850 as &#8216;the workshop of the world&#8217;.
But this period of industrial hegemony was short-lived. After 1870
came the economic decline of Britain, a process that has continued to
the present day. The &#8216;cultural critique&#8217; advanced by a number of
economic historians attributes Britain&#8217;s economic decline to an
&#8216;anti-business&#8217; and &#8216;anti-industrial&#8217; culture among people in
power in Britain.</p>
<p>Rather than seriously examine the actual historical relationship
between the development of capitalist economy and the institutions of
the state (government, law, the education system, civil servants,
police, the army etc.) Rubinstein attacks supporters of the &#8216;cultural
critique&#8217; with the argument that Britain was never really an
industrial nation and therefore has not suffered a process of
industrial decline.</p>
<p>In nearly all of his arguments he is wrong. For example, a British
Conservative writing in 1826, quoted in Trotsky&#8217;s <strong>Where is
Britain Going?</strong>, argues:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The prospects which are now opening to England almost
exceed the boundaries of thought, and can be measured by no standard
found in history ... The manufacturing industry of England may be
fairly computed as four times greater than that of all other
continents taken collectively, and sixteen such continents as Europe
could not manufacture as much cotton as England does.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">So much for Rubinstein&#8217;s claim that Britain was not the workshop
of the world.</p>
<p>Rubinstein&#8217;s arguments range from the unusual to the
questionable to the downright ridiculous. Thus having produced
statistical data on Britain&#8217;s industrial decline, he claims that it
is not really a question of the rapid <em>decline</em> of British
capitalism rather than the rapid <em>growth</em> of German and US
capitalism! In defending the decision of the British ruling class to
invest in services rather than manufacturing industry, Rubinstein
shows that more people use Heathrow airport than any other airport in
the world. Finally, he attacks those who maintain the superiority of
manufacturing over a service economy in the following terms: 
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is difficult to believe that there is not some underlying sexual
undertone to the preference for manufacturing rather than services&#8221;!</p>
<p class="fst">Rubinstein fails to draw a distinction between making money and
creating wealth. The British ruling class has been very skilful in
the former, but have shown little facility for the latter. Early in
the lifetime of the present Tory government, for example, the very
minimal exchange controls introduced by the previous Labour
government were lifted. Since then billions of pounds that could have
been invested in manufacturing industry has flowed abroad. This has
made the ruling class richer as has their colossal investment in
banking and insurance. But British manufacturing continues its
remorseless downward march.</p>
<p>These actions graphically indicate the absolute decline of British
capitalism, and the ruling class&#8217;s pessimism for the future.
Ironically they have less faith in the future of capitalism than have
the leadership of the Labour Party. But despite considerable
scholarship and research, this vital point is lost on Rubinstein.
Those looking for an introduction to the complex but vital questions
raised in this book are better advised to start with Trotsky&#8217;s
<strong>Where is Britain Going?</strong>, which retains today all the vitality
and relevance as when it was first published.</p>
