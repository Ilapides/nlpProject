<p class="fst"><em>NOVEMBER 22 marked the centenary of the birth of A.J. Cook. The
occasion was remembered by miners throughout Britain and the world
because of the enormously important role he played in the struggle to
establish trade unionism amongst miners.</em></p>

<p><em>The battles Cook led and fought in the 1920s contain important
lessons for trade unionists today and that is why we should carefully
study his life and work.</em></p>

<p>The main influence on Cook&#8217;s thinking was that of syndicalism.
As a philosophy syndicalism is characterised by both strengths and
weaknesses. It argues, and this is its fatal weakness, that the
struggle for socialism is essentially an <em>industrial</em> struggle,
which begins and <em>ends</em> on the shop floor. Marxism, on the other
hand accepts the importance of industrial struggle, but also argues
that <em>on their own</em> industrial struggles are insufficient to
bring about socialism. Shop floor battles need to be generalised into
political struggles linked to the perspective of achieving power for
the working class.</p>

<p>Syndicalism&#8217;s strength in the early twentieth century lay in its
progressive role in breaking down parochial attitudes amongst workers
and in fighting to organise strong industrial unions, particularly
among semi-skilled and unskilled workers.</p>

<p>This was true of one of the very early organisations in which Cook
played a part. The South Wales Miners&#8217; Unofficial Reform Committee
was formed out of the experiences of the 1912 miners&#8217; strike and
the Cambrian lock out. Cook and Noah Ablett established themselves as
dedicated fighters for the main demands of the committee, contained
in <strong>The Miners&#8217; Next Step</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>One union for all miners, with a string and centralised leadership.</li>

<li>A minimum wage of 8/&#8211; a day</li>

<li>A seven-hour day.</li>

<li>Control of the industry to be taken out of the hands of the
coal owners and run by the miners.</li>
</ul>

<p class="fst">Cook&#8217;s struggles in South Wales to win support for the demands
of <strong>The Miners&#8217; Next Step</strong> were a mere foretaste of the
titanic battles he was to lead in the 1920s. In this period the whip
of the bosses, determined to make the workers pay for capitalism&#8217;s
crisis, and the inspiration of the Bolshevik Revolution, spurred the
working class to colossal battles.</p>

<p>The first major battle came in 1921 when Lloyd George suddenly
announced the ending of war-time control over the coal industry and
the owners, proposing massive wage cuts, posted lock-out notices at
every pit.</p>

<p>The determination of the ruling class to break the unions and in
particular the miners was observed by Julian Symons, not a writer
noted for his revolutionary fervour:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;A state of emergency was declared, reservists were called to
the colours, <em>machine guns were posted at pit heads</em> and troops
in battle order were sent to many working class areas.&#8221; Symons &#8211;
<strong>The General Strike!</strong> (our emphasis)</p>

<p class="fst">The working class were betrayed by their own leaders. Last minute
hesitancy by miners&#8217; leader Hodges let the ultra-reactionary leader
of the railwaymen, Jimmy Thomas, seize the opportunity he had been
looking for [to call &#8211; <em>ID</em>] off the strike of Triple Alliance
unions. The entire working class, not just the miners, had been
betrayed in a most abject manner. The miners would now have to fight
on their own, and Friday 15 April, 1921 was to be bitterly remembered
as Black Friday.</p>

<p>During the 1921 lock-out Cook achieved national status as a
miners&#8217; leader. Correctly he tried to make the best of a very bad
situation and worked tirelessly for the miners&#8217; cause. A parallel
can be drawn here with the overwhelmingly successful struggle of the
miners in 1972 when a little known Yorkshire organiser, Arthur
Scargill, rose to national prominence.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Cook&#8217;s high point</h4>

<p class="fst">Given the betrayal of the leaders of what was subsequently
referred to as the Cripple Alliance the defeat of the miners was
inevitable. The betrayal wrought a terrible price not just on the
miners who returned to work on the coal owners&#8217; terms of massive
wage cuts, but within a year of the 1921 lock-out wage cuts had
successfully been imposed on engineering workers, shipyard workers
and cotton operatives. Drunk with success the coal owners and the
government decided where ever possible to victimise militants. Cook
was arrested, charged with unlawful assembly and sentenced to four
months imprisonment.</p>

<p>One of the conclusions drawn by rank and file militants from the
defeat of 1921 was the need to organise more effectively and to build
a fighting leadership in the TUC. To this end Cook played an
important role in the establishment of the National Minority
Movement. In 1924 its founding conference was attended by 270
delegates representing a quarter of a million workers. At its peak
the NMM had one million trade unionists affiliated to it, which
represented only a fraction of its true support and influence.</p>

<p>The newly formed Communist Party placed itself at the head of the
Minority Movement and, because of this, the movement was never able
to realise its true potential. Hindered by early bouts of
ultra-leftism and fatally misled by Stalin during the general strike,
the influence of the CP was another factor in the defeat of 1926.</p>

<p>In 1924 the solid support enjoyed by the Minority Movement among
miners was reflected in Cook&#8217;s election to the General Secretary&#8217;s
position of the MFGB.</p>

<p>Shortly after his election Cook led the miners into what appeared
to be a great victory. The appalling mismanagement of the industry by
the coal owners had delivered it to almost complete financial ruin.
The coal owners, determined to shift the responsibility for the
crisis onto the shoulders of the miners, served notice that the
miners would have to accept <em>less</em> money for working longer
hours. In June 1925 the owners served one month&#8217;s notice on the
miners to terminate the existing wages agreement, cut wages and
enforce longer hours.</p>

<p>During this crisis Cook adamantly refused to even to speak to the
coal owners until the notices were withdrawn. When the government,
obviously stalling, set up a court of inquiry into the coal industry,
which Cook correctly refused to appear before, so overwhelming was
the case in support of the miners that the court of inquiry,
eventually ruled in their favour! At rank and file level the miners
enjoyed massive support from fellow trade unionists and this was
sufficient to force the TUC General Council, frightened of losing its
authority, to declare in favour of the miners and threaten widespread
sympathy action in their support. In the face of such solid
opposition Tory Prime Minister Baldwin capitulated and on 31 July
announced a subsidy of &#163;23 million to the coal industry to prevent
wage cuts.</p>

<p>The miners had won a great victory largely as a result of Cook&#8217;s
determined leadership. 31 July went into the annals of labour history
as Red Friday.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Battle lines</h4>

<p class="fst">The tragedy of Red Friday was that many trade union leaders, even
some on the left, believed that Red Friday was the end and not the
beginning of the struggle. Baldwin&#8217;s subsidy was to last nine
months, until 1 May 1926. The ruling class was to use this nine
months to prepare thoroughly for a major confrontation with the trade unions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever it may cost in blood and treasure we shall find that
the trade unions will be smashed from top to bottom&#8221; &#8211; declared
Lord Londonderry speaking not just on behalf of his fellow coal
owners, but on behalf of the whole ruling class.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean all workers in this country have got to take
reductions&#8221;, said Baldwin.</p>

<p>The ruling class&#8217; meticulous preparations for civil war were
spearheaded by Winston Churchill who never missed an opportunity to
express his almost pathological hatred of trade unionism and
socialism. The TUC General Council did nothing.</p>

<p>When the general strike began the right-wing leadership of the TUC
were absolutely terrified of the force that they had unleashed. Again
Thomas personified the sheer rottenness of their position.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;What I dreaded more than anything else was ... if by
chance it should have got out of the hands of those who could be able
to exercise some control, every sane man then knows what would have
happened.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Cook declared a radically different, but nevertheless dangerously
misguided, point of view. &#8220;A strike of the miners would mean the
end of capitalism&#8221; he declared on the eve of the strike.</p>

<p>Throughout the nine heroic days of May 1926, whilst the right wing
consciously sold out their members, Cook fought might and main for a
miners&#8217; victory. But in this situation honesty and dedication were
not enough. Cook did not, and as a syndicalist could not, understand
the situation. The only way the general strike could have led to the
end of capitalism was to link the struggle to the perspective of
workers&#8217; power. This meant a leadership prepared to broaden the
struggle to link the Councils of Action to the perspective of a
democratic workers&#8217; state.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Communist Party was totally misled by Stalin.
They persuaded the Minority Movement to place their faith in the
&#8216;left&#8217; members of the TUC General Council. Two of these leaders,
Powell and Hicks, were to play a key role in the betrayal of the
strike whilst the CP tail-ended the movement with the totally
abstract slogan &#8220;All power to the TUC General Council&#8221;!</p>

<p>During the 1926 general strike the question of power was posed in
the starkest possible terms in British society. Syndicalism was put
to the test and failed. The main responsibility for the defeat of
1926 will always lie with the treacherous policy of the right wing
leaders of the TUC General Council. Compared with Cook they will
forever stand as pygmies in the gallery of working class leaders in
British history. Having said this it would be foolish to deny that
Cook&#8217;s politics bore <em>no</em> responsibility for the defeat of the
general strike.</p>

<p>The position of Marxism and the brilliant predictions made by
Trotsky in <strong>Where is Britain Going?</strong> were borne out entirely by
the events of May 1926. No situation could be of greater class
polarisation than that of a general strike.</p>

<p>Despite Cook&#8217;s total commitment to the miners&#8217; cause his
confused position left him with no credible alternative to that of
the right wing. In fact Cook withdrew from sale his pamphlet <strong>Nine
Days</strong> in which he criticised the right wing&#8217;s role in the
strike. He refused to support the demand for the reconvening of the
conference of trade union executives until <em>after</em> the miners&#8217;
lock out. Scandalously in the first TUC Congress after the strike
Cook added his enormous authority to the demand of the right wing
that the strike should not even be discussed!</p>

<p>The defeat of the general strike, the long lock-out of the miners,
and their return to work on the coal owners&#8217; terms shattered Cook.
The general strike constituted the greatest ever defeat of the
British working class. The unbelievable indignities the Tories
inflicted on the miners, and the sheer desperation of the situation
were summed up in a letter which Cook wrote in April 1929 to Arthur Horner:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Practically every day young men, stranded, call for
food, clothing and shelter at my office. Every day the post brings
terrible epistles of agony and despair. I have helped all I can,
begged all I can till I have been almost demented with despair.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Shortly after this Cook died of cancer. Every ounce of his energy
had been devoted to the cause of socialism, and every penny he owned
was given to the Miners&#8217; Federation. Hodges, his predecessor, was
appointed by the Tories a member of the National Electricity Board.
He later became a director of several colliery and steel companies
and died in 1947 leaving an estate of over &#163;100,000. He represents
the traditions of the right wing. Cook represents a tradition the
right wing cannot begin to understand.</p>

<p>After 1926 the trade unions were broken. Company unionism spread
like a cancer throughout the coalfields. Today the unions are
infinitely stringer and in the coming battles we can learn from
Cook&#8217;s weaknesses, but more importantly draw inspiration from his
strengths.</p>
