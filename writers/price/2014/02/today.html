<p class="fst"><strong>Marxism in Today&#8217;s World</strong><br/>
by Peter Taaffe</p>
<p class="fst">This Christmas, one of my presents was the book <strong>Marxism in
Today&#8217;s World</strong> by Peter Taaffe. This is an extended interview
originally given in 2003 to an Italian Marxist, on the politics of
the Socialist Party, the Committee for a Workers&#8217; International
(CWI) and <strong>The Socialist</strong>&#8217;s forerunner, <strong>Militant</strong>, with
additional comments from Bob Labi of the CWI.</p>
<p>Peter Taaffe, Bob Labi and I all became Trotskyists in the 1960s;
I first joined Militant in 1968. In fact, a decisive factor in my
joining was Peter&#8217;s capacity to explain some of the complex ideas
of Marxism in a way working class men and women could understand.</p>
<p>In 1969, I was elected as Welsh representative on the National
Committee of the Labour Party Young Socialists, and later, when
Marxists became a majority of the Committee, I became National
Vice-chairperson of the organisation while Bob Labi (the London
representative) became editor of the LPYS newspaper (then known as <strong>Left</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Marxism in Today&#8217;s World</strong> is divided into the following
sections: 9/11 and after; the world situation; the Middle East;
Ireland and the National Question; the Permanent Revolution today;
Russia, Eastern Europe and State Capitalism; China; the history of
the Militant and the CWI.</p>
<p>I am unable to make detailed comments on most of these sections
except to say that there is important commentary on a difficult
period from roughly 1985 to 1995, a period that saw the defeat of the
miners&#8217; strike of 1984&#8211;85, the collapse of Stalinism across
Eastern Europe, and the Labour Party&#8217;s shift to the right.</p>
<p>Some chose to deny social reality and remained within the Labour
Party, deluding themselves and a few others that things had not
fundamentally changed.</p>
<p>Some of these went on to pursue parliamentary ambitions that some
of them probably had when they described themselves as Marxists.</p>
<p>Some, including Peter, me and many others, were expelled from the
Labour Party, helped to establish Militant Labour and remain today as
members of the Socialist Party and the CWI.</p>
<p>I hope every member of the Socialist Party and the CWI reads
<strong>Marxism in Today&#8217;s World</strong>, including young comrades not even
born when many of the events analysed took place.</p>
<p>To work properly as a party member in today&#8217;s world you need to
understand how we have cherished and defended at each stage our most
important legacy: the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky.</p>
<p>Buy this book, read it, organise branch meetings around it and
help develop your own political understanding to the point where you
can play a decisive role in ridding the world of the scourge of capitalism.</p>
