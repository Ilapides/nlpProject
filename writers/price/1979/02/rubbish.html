Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Reg Deacon [Chairman Cardiff No.&nbsp;18 branch GMWU] and Doug
Toutt on the picket line spoke to <strong>Militant</strong>:</em></p>

<p class="fst">Cardiff&#8217;s dustmen initially voted to work during the low pay
dispute, and about two-thirds of the refuse would have been
collected. But management [i.e. Cardiff Tory council] told them they
would work as normal or not at all. This deliberate provocation has
led to an all-out dustmen&#8217;s strike in Cardiff.</p>

<p>Doug&#8217;s wage slip showed a take-home pay of £43 after being paid
a bonus. This was for a driver &#8211; assistants get less and many have
to claim FIS to make ends meet.</p>

<p>Because the employers&#8217; offer does not cover bonuses it would
mean only 70p a week for most of the men!</p>

<p>Picketing has been very successful. If Jim Callaghan tried to
cross the picket line, said Dave, they would persuade him not to. But
if he did, it would show him up in his true colours.</p>

<p>All the pickets felt angry that they had been forced to take this
action under a Labour government. They felt the government&#8217;s
attitude was bound to disillusion Labour voters. One thing was
certain, however: the last person they wanted was Margaret Thatcher.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We want £60 a week &#8211; I&#8217;m fed up of collecting
rubbish and getting paid rubbish for it.&#8221;</p>
