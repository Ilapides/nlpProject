<p class="fst"><strong>At a recent meeting Cardiff South East CLP nominated Denis
Healey for the position of deputy leader of the Party.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing surprising about that you might say coming from one of the
most right-wing CLPs in Britain. But the way in which this decision
was reached should be of concern to every activist in the Party.</p>
<p>When GMC members received their notice of the meeting, they also
received without any explanation at all a piece of paper on which
they had to write the name of the candidate they supported for Party
leader, deputy leader, and treasurer. At the meeting Lord Brooks, the
CLP secretary and national organiser for &#8216;Solidarity&#8217; explained
that this &#8216;democratic&#8217; procedure would allow everybody to have
their say. Yes indeed! At least one ballot paper went to somebody
living outside the constituency!</p>
<p>Brooks refused to give any explanation as to how many ballot
papers had been sent out, how many had been sent back, and after the
count no figures were given on the votes cast for each candidate. In
addition Brooks was quite prepared to dish out ballot papers at the
GMC meeting on request, so as far as the GMC knew nothing could have
prevented a delegate posting his ballot paper in and then claiming
another one at the meeting.</p>
<p>During the protests that were going on about this appalling
travesty of the basic principles of electoral procedure one delegate
asked Brooks if he would read out the letters that had been sent to
each CLP from Tony Benn and John Silkin. Brooks replied that he had
read the letters and they were rubbish so he had left them at home.</p>
<p>Any active trade unionist would literally cringe at the idea of a
secretary having the right to arbitrarily decide which correspondence
should be reported to a meeting. There have already been disputes
over correspondence. Brooks left a YS resolution off the GMC agenda,
claiming he had not received it, yet two YS members said they had
taken the trouble of personally delivering it to Brooks.</p>
<p>The way in which Cardiff South East CLP is run has important
lessons for the movement. Having been an active member of this party
for over 10 years, I cannot recall many GMCs in the last few years
where the sort of attacks one reads in the <strong>Daily Express</strong> about
the <strong>Militant</strong> and the left in general are not made.</p>
<p>Practically always these attacks are spearheaded by Brooks and
local MP Jim Callaghan. They are supported by a small vociferous
clique of right-wingers who resort to terrible personal abuse when
their position is challenged. When you next hear Denis Healey
attacking the &#8216;intolerance&#8217; of the left, remember that it is
people like these who desperately want him to win.</p>
