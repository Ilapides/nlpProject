<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;565, 14 August 1981, p.&nbsp;8.<br/>
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">Dear Comrade,</p>

<p class="fst">John Goleman&#8217;s letter concerning the heckling of Neil Kinnock at
this year&#8217;s South Wales gala (issue 563) completely misses the
point made by Merion Evans (560).</p>

<p>The election of the deputy leader of the Labour Party offers Party
members a clear choice between the policies of diluted Thatcherism
represented by Healey, and the socialist policies endorsed by
successive conferences, represented by Tony Benn.</p>

<p>To his shame Kinnock has refused to support Benn. I can understand
right-wing Labour MPs supporting Healey (everyone should have a
chance of one death wish), but for the life of me I cannot understand
why a so-called &#8216;left&#8217; MP should take the position Kinnock does.</p>

<p>That is the real issue behind Merion&#8217;s original letter, which
Comrade Goleman avoids in his letter.</p>

<p>As Comrade Goleman seems interested in evoking the memory of
previous speakers at South Wales miners galas, may I quote from Nye
Bevan who regularly spoke at the gala and was never heckled. Bevan&#8217;s
advice to Richard Crossman in 1955 is most relevant to Kinnock and
other &#8216;left&#8217; MPs today who choose to backslide on the deputy
leadership issue:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In moments of crisis when the knives are out,
equivocation is tantamount to treachery.&#8221;</p>
