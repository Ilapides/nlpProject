<br />
<p class="fst">On 27 October, BBC 2 viewers watched a programme fronted by former
deputy prime minister John Prescott, purporting to explain the class
system in contemporary Britain. Although making a few valid points,
the programme failed to explain class and exposed Prescott&#8217;s
hypocrisy as a major figure in the &#8216;modernisation&#8217; of the Labour Party.</p>

<p>Prescott&#8217;s origins are undoubtedly working class, as he began
his working life as a seafarer, playing a key role in what was then
the National Union of Seamen (NUS). On TV he could have used the
opportunity to explain how important trade unions are in representing
working-class interests and how the organised working class needs to
be politically represented.</p>

<p>Or he could have explained how a particularly ruthless set of
employers led him as a young militant to play a key role in the
national strike of the NUS in 1966.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>No longer believes in trade unionism</h4>

<p class="fst">Instead we heard none of this, because Prescott no longer believes
in trade unionism as his resignation from the RMT (successor to the
NUS) amply demonstrates. Instead Prescott chose to focus on trivia on
what he thought the working class eats and drinks and how its members speak.</p>

<p>On more than one occasion he railed against private education and
the huge correlation between the numbers in society who are privately
educated and the percentage of such people occupying elite positions.
Fair enough, but he needs to explain why this inequality persists
after eleven years of a government in which he was a prominent member.</p>

<p>The system of British private education has a charitable status,
meaning the schools can claim tax exemption. This in turn means that
the working-class taxpayer subsidises the fees of those who want to
pay &#0163;30,000 annually.</p>

<p>In the past there were debates in the Labour Party between those
who favoured the outright abolition of private education and those
who believed that such a policy would frighten middle-class voters.
They argued for the expediency of ending private schools&#8217;
charitable status.</p>

<p>Yet Prescott was a major supporter of the creation of New Labour.
This has ended this debate totally, to the extent that his was the
first Labour government that the bastions of educational privilege
felt safe with.</p>

<p>Many trade unionists, especially those like me who are involved
with education, will note the hypocrisy of Prescott&#8217;s attack on
private education.</p>

<p>His and Tony Blair&#8217;s government privatised part of English
secondary education through the development of academy schools.
Similarly Prescott&#8217;s posture as a champion of opportunity for
working-class students could be taken more seriously had he not
supported the introduction of fees and then top-up fees for
university students.</p>

<p>Whatever facile remark Prescott or the BBC chooses to make, the
British class system is not principally about fee-paying schools,
Lords of the Manor or correct pronunciation. It is principally about
an economic system, capitalism, that divides people on class lines
between those who own wealth and the means of producing it and those
who live by selling their labour power through work.</p>
<p>However much beer or tea he drinks or however much Prescott likes
fish and chips, he cannot conceal the fact that under the government
he served, the rich became considerably richer at the expense of the
rest of us.</p>

<p>The reason why Prescott and his mates got away with this is that
they succeeded in changing the class nature of the Labour Party, from
one whose roots were in trade unionism and socialist values to an
unashamedly pro-business party, which in Peter Mandelson&#8217;s
disgusting phrase &#8220;is intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich&#8221;.</p>

<p>At the end of the day Prescott&#8217;s programme was of little use to
those attempting to understand class today, but of some use to those
fighting to bury New Labour and build a new working-class party.</p>
