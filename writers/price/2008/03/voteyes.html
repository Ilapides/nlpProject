<p class="fst">For the last two years Welsh FE lecturers have enjoyed something
as yet beyond the reach of their counterparts in England and Northern
Ireland &#8211; pay parity with schoolteachers.</p>

<p>This national agreement was not the result of the generosity of
the employers or the &#8216;clear red water&#8217; that supposedly separates
New Labour in Westminster from its colleagues in the Welsh Assembly
in Cardiff. It was the achievement of NATFHE (UCU&#8217;s predecessor
union), which in Wales was genuinely left-led. We threatened the
employers with a massive programme of strike action unless agreement
was reached.</p>

<p>Now at virtually the first serious test of the agreement, the
employers are blatantly breaking it by refusing lecturers the right
to progress to the top point of the salary scale.</p>

<p>UCU members throughout Welsh FE understand that this dispute goes
a lot further than this. If the employers break the agreement now,
that is the start of a slippery slope.</p>

<p>The agreement has given our membership a small element of
protection from the free-market madness originally introduced by the
Tories but sustained by New Labour in both London and Cardiff, which
once meant 23 Welsh FE colleges all on different pay rates!</p>

<p>It is essential that UCU members throughout Welsh FE deliver a
massive &#8216;Yes&#8217; vote to both questions on the ballot paper. Voting
results will be watched carefully by both the employers and Assembly politicians.</p>

<p>Recently the Webb review into post-school education in Wales
recommended the reduction in Welsh FE colleges from 23 to 9. Nobody
believes that such a reduction could be achieved without massive
redundancies &#8211; mostly compulsory.</p>

<p>Fforwm therefore views this dispute as a forerunner of a future
bigger battle. Most Welsh FE college principals have imposed a 2.5%
pay increase &#8211; then awarded themselves an increase way above that.
In the week that Welsh Assembly members awarded themselves an 8%
increase, UCU members have every right to expect decent pay levels.</p>

<p>A victory in this dispute would not just be a victory for our
membership; it would be a victory also for the students throughout
the communities we serve.</p>
