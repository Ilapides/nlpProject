<br />
<p class="fst">The Tories&#8217; first year in office has been a continuous onslaught
on our education services. This is the stark challenge facing the
annual conference of the National Association of Teachers in Further
and Higher Education.</p>

<p>As the NEC report points out, the cuts already imposed on the
Manpower Services Commission have had a serious effect on further
education courses and the cuts the MSC will make in 1980 will have a
more drastic effect in the academic year 1980&#8211;1. The swingeing
increases in overseas students&#8217; fees will have a similar effect in
jeopardising a number of valuable courses.</p>

<p>In the field of higher education, the government limit on the
financial pool for advanced courses will, as the NEC rightly points
out, have &#8220;disastrous consequences for public sector higher education.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the pay front, contrary to the exaggerated claims of the Tory
press, most teachers in further and higher education gained very
little from the Clegg settlement. In fact NATFHE members will have to
wait until September 1981 before they have had a year&#8217;s salary as
agreed by Clegg. This is from an agreement on our 1979 salaries!</p>

<p>Clegg has failed to restore the salaries as outlined by the
Houghton settlement in 1975, except for a small number of badly-paid
teachers, and has enormously increased pay differentials.</p>
<p>Last week the final insult came when Clegg reported that he had
&#8220;miscalculated by 4 per cent&#8221;. It is doubtful whether management
will try to claw this back; almost certainly they will try to take it
from the 1980&#8211;1 claim.</p>

<p>Conference should draw up a balance sheet from this particular
experience and the union must resolve never again to be caught in the
trap of comparability deals.</p>

<p>All this reinforces the urgency of the pay settlement of 1980&#8211;1.
With the present high rates of inflation, the NEC has estimated that
any settlement below 20% will represent a devaluation of Clegg before
the members have received it.</p>

<p>The support for a half-day strike in the recent branch ballot on
further sanctions should negotiations break down, is a positive
indication of the discontent on pay. Members now expect action to
secure a 20% settlement.</p>

<p>As the struggle against Thatcher&#8217;s policies become more intense,
NATFHE members have been forced to recognise the need for political
action. As the ATTI, NATFHE was the first teachers&#8217; union to
affiliate to the TUC. It should now set the lead amongst teachers by
affiliating to the Labour Party.</p>

<p>The Socialist Education Association will be holding a fringe
meeting as the start of a campaign for NATFHE affiliation, a campaign
which should be fully supported by the membership as a whole. Only by
posing the socialist alternative to the free market madness of
Thatcher and Joseph, can we secure a decent education system for our
members and the youth of Britain.</p>
