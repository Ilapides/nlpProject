<p class="fst"><strong>THIS YEAR'S Annual Conference of lecturers' union NATFHE
took place at a time of the greatest offensive by the employers
and the government against pay and conditions since the
Incorporation (privatisation) of Further Education Colleges (FE)
and Universities (HE).</strong></p>

<p class="fst">Conference acclaimed the struggles of our members against
management bullying in Newcastle and Southampton FE colleges and in
London Metropolitan University. Conference condemned the failure of
around 75% of English FE colleges to implement a national pay deal
nearly two years after its agreement. We also passed a motion that
refused to absolve the leadership of NATFHE of some of the
responsibility for this appalling situation.</p>
<p>Conference enthusiastically endorsed general secretary Paul
Mackney's call for a national strike in the autumn in support of the
English FE pay claim. In an excellent debate on pensions, conference
unanimously passed a motion from Wales arguing that New Labour will
return to the offensive against public-sector workers' pensions, but
this time around must be met by strike action by the relevant unions
on the same day.</p>
<p>Most of the second day of the conference was taken up with the
debate over the proposed merger with the Association of University
Teachers (AUT). Sensibly the leadership dropped its previous policy
of forbidding any debate on the proposed sixth draft of the
constitution of the new union and backed Emergency Resolution 15.1
from Wales calling for a full discussion and vote on proposals to
amend the constitution.</p>
<p>After the passing of the motion conference engaged in a
constructive debate. But proposals to include all aspects of current
democracy in the new constitution were defeated, despite attracting
substantial minority votes.</p>
<p>NATFHE and AUT members will now be balloted in the Autumn, opening
up the prospect of a larger more powerful union. If properly led,
this could confront and defeat all who wish to extend market forces
to post-school education.</p>
