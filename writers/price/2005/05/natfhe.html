<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">In Wales talks between the employers and trade unions in FE
recently broke down as a result of the employers walking from the
negotiating table. NATFHE in Wales is a left-led union and the
employers were angered at the union&#8217;s position on its proposals on
part-time teaching staff and the union&#8217;s opposition to employer
proposals on progression on the new pay scales.</p>

<p>In England, a full two years after a national pay agreement on
pay, only 25% of FE colleges have implemented it in full.</p>

<p>In Southampton College the management response is to produce a new
contract based on performance-related pay, and threaten members with
the sack if they do not sign up to it! In HE similar bullying has
been employed in London Metropolitan University.</p>

<p>In Wales NATFHE has given the employers a deadline of 1 August to
return to the negotiating table and implement the part-timers&#8217;
agreement, otherwise members will be balloted for industrial action
from September.</p>

<p>In both FE and HE when our members strike, employers usually
deduct pay at more than one day for each day out, with the ridiculous
outcome of a NATFHE member being on strike for three weeks actually
owing the employer money! Conference motions and emergency motions
committing the union to sustentation (strike pay) of &#163;50 per day
must be supported.</p>

<p>More than this, Conference must unequivocally support any section
of our membership that takes strike action to confront the employers&#8217;
offensive. For far too long NATFHE has allowed its members to be
picked off college by college and university by university.</p>

<p>Conference must find a way around the obstacles placed by the
incorporation (privatisation) of colleges and universities and the
anti-union laws to ensure a united struggle against the employers.</p>

<p>Conference will, however, be dominated by an internal issue, the
proposed merger with the Association of University Teachers. In
principle, nobody can actually oppose the merger or the prospect of
one union representing all who teach in post-school education.
However, it would seem that some supporters are so intent on merger,
at the expense of a proper discussion on the proposed constitution
and safeguarding democracy and accountability, that they are not even
prepared to have the issue properly aired at this Conference.</p>

<p>Conference must oppose this and support the emergency motions on
these matters from Wales, Yorkshire and Humberside and Northern
Regions.</p>
