<p class="fst"><strong>The Labour Party Young Socialists have swung into action to
counter racialists and have won a tremendous response from immigrant
workers and wide sections of the labour movement. They have set an
example for the labour movement nationally how to defeat racialist
propaganda and build support for the movement.</strong></p>

<p>The last two weeks had seen the development of activities by
anti-immigrant groups in the city. On Friday June 19th the
Anti-Immigration League organised a meeting in Cardiff to be
addressed by Lady Birdwood and Sadie Relph.</p>

<p>A picket of the meeting was organised which was supported by the
Cardiff Trades Council. Given the shortage of time the picket was a
great success. Two hundred pickets lined the street outside the hall,
and only 15 turned up for the racialist meeting which was switched to
the home of the organiser!</p>

<p>Unfortunately the efforts of the labour movement in the city to
fight racialism have been hindered by a very negative attitude by
certain officials in the movement. Emrys Jones, the Welsh Regional
Organiser for the Labour Party, appealed twice through the press to
Labour Party members in the area to stay away from the picket!</p>

<p>On Saturday June 20th Cardiff North West, Cardiff South and
Cardiff North LPYS branches organised a meeting against racialism. On
learning about this meeting Jones circulated the 3 Constituency
Labour Parties, claiming that such a meeting was likely to worsen
race relations in the city and that in his opinion the CLPs <em>should
not give permission for the LYPS branches to hold this meeting!</em></p>

<p>On Friday June 19th the 3 CLPs met and discussed Jones&#8217; letter.
To their great credit Cardiff North and Cardiff North West CLPs
ignored Jones&#8217; advice and gave support to the meeting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately due to <em>a strong appeal from James Callaghan</em>
(the local MP) and a very obstructive attitude from the chair in
refusing to allow a full discussion on the issue Cardiff South East
GMC vote not to support the meeting.</p>

<p>On Sunday June 20th the immigrant community gave the best possible
reply to Emrys Jones. Around 100 people crowded into the meeting,
literally squashed into every corner of the room. Over half the
meeting was composed of immigrant workers, with practically every
immigrant group represented.</p>

<p>The first speaker was Henry Newbury, himself an Asian and a member
of Cardiff West CLP and the AUEW, described the life of an Asian
immigrant in Britain. In a fighting contribution Henry produced
statistics which utterly refuted the poisonous propaganda of the
racialists. He pointed the way forward for the movement in calling
for unity between black and white workers on a socialist programme.</p>

<p>Paul Copping (Cardiff North LPYS and LPYS Welsh Regional
Committee) in an excellent speech showed how racialism was a tool of
the ruling class to create divisions amongst the working class. Paul
echoed Henry&#8217;s arguments that in no sense could immigrants be held
responsible for the shortages of jobs, low wages, lack of housing
etc. Paul called for a campaign against racialism aimed at striking
at the very root of the disease.</p>

<p>The lively discussion that followed was led by the immigrant
comrades. Practically every immigrant speaker supported the arguments
of the platform.</p>

<p><em>More significantly they all pledged full support and full
involvement of their groups in the co-ordinating committee set up by
the LPYS against racialism in the city.</em></p>

<p>This fantastic response showed the willingness of the immigrant
workers to struggle alongside their white brothers against injustice
and to involve themselves in a real socialist campaign.</p>
