<p class="fst"><strong>LAST NOVEMBER the Welsh Assembly, through its education
minister Jane Davidson, intervened in the long-running dispute
over Further Education (FE) college lecturers&#8217; pay. They
promised the injection of &#163;9 million, paving the way for parity
of pay between FE lecturers and schoolteachers in April 2004.</strong></p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">For NATFHE, the main trade union organising teaching staff in FE
colleges, acceptance of these proposals meant a switch from national
(England and Wales) pay bargaining to Wales-level bargaining.</p>

<p>Wales also withdrew from national industrial action, notably the
one-day strike called jointly with UNISON on 5 November 2002.</p>

<p>Acceptance of the proposals meant a tacit recognition that the
only way the union could achieve justice on pay was through a
partnership with the employers and New Labour in the Welsh Assembly.</p>

<p>For this reason, prominent left-wingers in the union in Wales like
myself and Craig Lewis, the chair of the FE sector committee, opposed
the Davidson proposals.</p>

<p>We pointed out the college employers&#8217; poor record on pay and
conditions since the incorporation (privatisation) of FE Colleges by
the Tories in 1993.</p>

<p>NATFHE members in Wales voted narrowly to accept the Davidson
proposals. From then, every left-wing activist in the union in Wales
strove to achieve the best possible deal in line with member&#8217;s wishes.</p>

<p>Initially negotiations with the Welsh employers organisation
Fforwm went relatively smoothly, with agreement being reached on the
allocation of the &#163;9 million from the Assembly, giving most to the
lowest-paid workers &#8211; the support staff and the hourly paid
teaching staff and least to the management grades.</p>

<p>However, talks on parity with schoolteachers quickly floundered.
Currently schoolteachers are employed on a six-point scale, following
which a teacher may progress through a five-point upper scale after
successful completion of development reviews.</p>

<p>Given the clear similarity between the job of a schoolteacher and
a FE college lecturer, NATFHE argues that all main-grade college
lecturers should have the same opportunities as schoolteachers to progress.</p>

<p>This position was opposed by the employers, who proposed a new
grade &#8211; Advanced Practitioners, meaning that only a small minority
of main-grade lecturers would progress to parity with schoolteachers.</p>

<p>NATFHE made a number of concessions to achieve agreement but the
employers refused to compromise. They didn&#8217;t use the funding
argument, stating that not all of us deserve pay parity with schoolteachers.</p>

<p>NATFHE in Wales has already adopted an action programme, should
pay talks break down, involving a three-day strike in September to be
escalated if necessary to indefinite strike action. The strategy was
endorsed by the union&#8217;s national conference, which also voted
overwhelmingly despite opposition from the right-wing, to support
members on strike at &#163;50 per day from day one.</p>

<p>A victory for NATFHE members in Wales would pave the way for a
similar victory in England, a victory for all trade unionists.</p>
