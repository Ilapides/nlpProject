<p class="fst"><strong>NATFHE, THE trade union organising lecturing staff in further
education (FE) colleges and new universities in England and Wales has
its conference this weekend.</strong></p>
<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />

<p class="fst">The war with Iraq has had a huge impact on consciousness and
social relationships. From the outset the union played an important
and very principled role, affiliating to the Stop the War Coalition,
with union members prominent in the mass anti-war demonstrations.</p>
<p>Prior to the outbreak of war, general secretary Paul Mackney,
along with Mick Rix of ASLEF, argued on the TUC general council that
the TUC should co-ordinate strike action against war. The day after
war broke out, the Equality Committee of the NEC accepted my proposal
calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Iraq;
supporting NATFHE members and other trade unionists for walking out
of their workplaces in protest and congratulating all students who
had walked out of schools and colleges.</p>
<p>Contrary to the arguments of sections of NATFHE&#8217;s right wing,
the issue of war is a crucial question for all trade unionists. The
general secretary and the NEC&#8217;s position accurately reflected
members&#8217; views, particularly the active membership.</p>
<p>Conference must ensure that there is no doubt on this question by
passing the emergency motion from Wales, which endorses the above
position and condemns the TUC for failing to mobilise strike action.</p>
<p>On members&#8217; pay and conditions, big issues will be debated. In
higher education our members struggle in a severely underfunded
sector. The university sector has been badly let down by New Labour.</p>
<p>Tuition fees and top-up fees obstruct working-class students&#8217;
entry to university. But they also fail abysmally to provide the
funding for decentpay and working conditions for our members and to
provide quality education.</p>
<p>Charles Clarke, Margaret Hodge and the rest are being outflanked
by the Tories, with the hypocritical call by Duncan-Smith to abolish
tuition fees.</p>
<p>The problem will not be resolved, as the Tories claim, by reducing
the number of students going to university. Nor will it be resolved
within a tax system defended by capitalist parties such as the Tories
and New Labour, which treats the very rich more leniently than almost
anywhere in the capitalist world.</p>
<p>In further education, for the first time pay negotiations are
being conducted separately in England and Wales. Despite a pay deal
rewarding lower-paid members more than others in Wales, members in
both England and Wales are off target for pay parity with school
teachers by next year.</p>
<p>The employers are evidently opposed to this moderate demand. If we
are to achieve parity it will not be through &#8216;partnership&#8217; with
either the employers or New Labour. Past experience shows that strike
action is the only language that such people understand.</p>
<p>This conference must be prepared to put this to our members,
accepting that if we go up this road NATFHE must give adequate
financial support to our members on strike.</p>
