<p class="fst">THE BEST result for Labour in the whole of Britain in the May
elections came in South Glamorgan. One of the main planks of the
party manifesto was the policy of no compulsory redundancies, which
the Labour-controlled authority had upheld between 1981 and 1985.</p>

<p>National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education
(NATFHE) members in South Glamorgan were therefore horrified to hear,
on 9 July, that the county council intended to proceed with ten
compulsory redundancies among the teachers at the South Glamorgan
Institute of Higher Education.</p>

<p>Horror turned to seething anger when the full story emerged.</p>

<p>Labour councillors had been discussing these policies with
education officials for a month without informing the college
lecturer&#8217;s union. Clearly, Labour councillors believed that
delaying announcements until colleges were breaking up would defuse
trade union action.</p>

<p>The Labour councillors had, however, grossly miscalculated. Our
members at the South Glamorgan Institute went on strike. On Tuesday
10 July over 150 took part in a lobby of the education committee.</p>

<p>To their shame the Labour councillors, to the obvious delight of
the Tories, recommended that the ten redundancies take place.</p>

<p>On Thursday 19 July a similar number of council workers lobbied
South Glamorgan Labour Party&#8217;s monthly meeting. To their credit the
officers allowed any council worker who was a party member the right
to attend and speak at the meeting.</p>

<p>An emergency resolution upholding the policy of no compulsory
redundancies was passed overwhelmingly (with a number of Labour
councillors abstaining).</p>

<p>Within 24 hours council leader Bob Morgan announced that the
redundancy notices were to be withdrawn.</p>
