<p class="fst">On Saturday February 5th over 200 people crowded into the Miners
Welfare Hall in Pontillan Fraith for a meeting called by Bedwellty
Labour Party to celebrate <strong>Tribune</strong>&#8217;s 40th Anniversary.</p>
<p>The first speaker Richard Clements (Editor of <strong>Tribune</strong>)
spoke vaguely about the need for &#8216;a socialist press&#8217; without
really spelling out how this was to be achieved or what policies such
a press should advance.</p>
<p>Arianwen Norris (Aneurin Bevan&#8217;s sister) spoke of the campaign
to obtain regular sales of <strong>Tribune</strong> in Tredegar in 1937.
Describing the impoverished social conditions of working class people
at the time, she explained how the newspaper was well received.</p>
<p><em>Arianwen recently gave support to a resolution passed
unanimously by Ebbw Vale CLP opposing the witch hunt against <strong>Militant</strong>
supporters. To her credit she has not abandoned the socialist
traditions of the early pioneers of <strong>Tribune</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Fred Evans MP for Caerphilly drew strong applause from the
audience when he attacked &#8216;the conspiracy of the right wing of the
party, and the Tory press to deny that Marxism is a legitimate part
of the traditions of the Labour Party.&#8217;</p>
<p>The final speaker Ian Mikardo began by describing the swelling
opposition to the right wing policies of the Labour government from
the movement.</p>
<p><em>He said that every month the NEC receives around 100
resolutions critical of government policy, some sharply so.</em>
Unfortunately Comrade Mikardo spent most of his speech explaining
that however bad this government was, it was better than any Tory
government. It is extremely doubtful whether one single member of the
audience needed this explanation.</p>
<p>Although references were made by various speakers to &#8220;the
alternative strategy&#8221; of <strong>Tribune</strong> not once was an attempt
made to justify or explain this programme. Despite the good
intentions of the organisers, such meetings can in the final analysis
only serve to frustrate the attempts of the movement to formulate
alternative policies to the present disastrous policies of the
government. In particular the absence of questions and discussion
from the floor was a poor example to the movement.</p>
<p>Because of Callaghan&#8217;s links with South Wales, the <strong>Militant</strong>
supporters in the area, particularly within his own constituency have
been singled out for attack by the press. This seems to have
rebounded as <em>120 people from the meeting signed a petition
condemning the witch hunt, and those party members who use the Tory
press to attack other party members.</em> Over 60 copies of <strong>Militant</strong>
were sold.</p>
