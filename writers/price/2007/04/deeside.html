<p class="fst"><strong>TOWARDS THE end of 2006, the University and College Union
(UCU) rejected a pay offer from the Welsh employers&#8217; organisation
Fforwm, declared a dispute and began to ballot for strike action.</strong></p>

<p class="fst">A little later Bernice Waugh, one of the union&#8217;s three lay
negotiators was declared compulsorily redundant from her post in the
Welsh College of Horticulture.</p>
<p>Shortly after this in Deeside College another lay negotiator,
Craig Lewis, saw his remission time from teaching to be a negotiator
removed. In January, as the third lay negotiator, I was threatened
with redundancy and the loss of my remission time.</p>
<p>In my own case a negotiated settlement protecting both my job and
my remission time in Coleg Glan Hafren Cardiff was reached last week.</p>
<p>In Deeside the principal compounded his victimisation of Craig
Lewis by sacking Pete Jones, a candidate in the recent UCU general
secretary election in the middle of the campaign!</p>
<p>When Deeside branch produced a newsletter condemning
victimisation, the principal was mortally offended and demanded its
withdrawal and an apology.</p>
<p>When the branch told him exactly what to do with those requests he
took steps amounting to the virtual derecognition of the union in the
college.</p>
<p>Following the refusal of the branch officers to sign a document
retracting perfectly true statements accepted as such by UCU members
in the college, Deeside branch is now balloting for a programme of
strike action and action short of a strike.</p>
<p>The actions of the principal of Deeside College are a total
disgrace, typical of the management thuggery introduced into FE by
arrangements initiated by the Tories but preserved by New Labour.</p>
<p>They threaten every UCU member, whether employed in an FE College
or a university. Our members in Deeside must win this dispute. Theirs
would not just be a victory for all workers in post-school education,
but for workers everywhere.</p>
<p class="fst"><strong>Post script.</strong> On Saturday 21 April, UCU Wales conference
unanimously passed a motion condemning Deeside management and
supporting our members.</p>
<p>The conference also unanimously re-elected Craig Lewis, Andrew
Price and Bernice Waugh as lay negotiators.</p>
