<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">Three candidates are up for general secretary &#8211; Sally Hunt
(currently joint general secretary of UCU), Roger Kline (an official
heading the union&#8217;s Equality and Employment unit) and Pete Jones, a
lay activist from the Further Education (FE) sector.</p>

<p>Nearly 14 years after the passing of the infamous Tory <em>Further
and Higher Education Act</em> the dire effects of the introduction of
market forces into the provision of post-school education are plain
to see.</p>

<p>University top up fees, New Labour&#8217;s policies will soon mean
&#163;10,000 annually with increased problems for working-class students
and university funding.</p>

<p>University lecturers today are among the worst paid of all
teachers in both school and post-school education.</p>

<p>Only in Wales (where the union is left-led) has pay parity between
FE lecturers and school teachers been achieved. In England it is
still a long way off. In Northern Ireland our members have recently
taken strike action to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>New Labour has actually increased the Tory pressure of
privatisation and cuts. Currently our FE members are fighting some
appalling attacks on English as a Second Language (ESOL) provision.</p>

<p>Against this background UCU needs a left general secretary who can
give the lead all our members need.</p>

<p>Nobody claims that Sally Hunt is a left candidate, and her victory
may be welcomed by the employers and by government ministers. Many
activists see her hand in the unsatisfactory settlement of the
university pay dispute last summer.</p>

<p>Her unprincipled position of &#8220;members first and politics second&#8221;
helps nobody and threatens the work of the union in opposing both the
occupation of Iraq and racism and fascism.</p>

<p>Roger Kline and Pete Jones are both left candidates with much to
offer. But in this two-horse race between Roger and Sally Hunt a vote
for Kline is the best way to avoid a Hunt victory.</p>

<p>For this and other reasons Socialist Party members in UCU call
upon all members to vote for Roger Kline. But more importantly we
must build a strong union from below that will campaign for a
publicly owned and accountable post-school education system, where
all workers are properly rewarded.</p>
