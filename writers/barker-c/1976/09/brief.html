<h2>Colin Barker</h2>

<h1>In Brief</h1>

<h3>(September 1976)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>International Socialism</strong> (1st series), <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index3.html#isj091" target="new">No.91</a>, September 1976, p.32.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">Readers might like to note a number of publications which have appeared since the spring, and which might get missed otherwise. Counter Information Services (9 Poland St, London, W1) has brought out another of its <em>Crisis</em> reports, <strong>Women Under Attack</strong>, a very useful compilation at 45p. Their next pamphlet promises an exposure of &#8216;the fallacies of the government&#8217;s economic strategy&#8217;.</p>

<p>Recently, we reviewed the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science&#8217;s pamphlet on <strong>Oil</strong> (75p, also from 9 Poland Street). Note should also be taken of a matching pamphlet, at 25p, on <strong>Noise</strong>. BSSRS will give cut prices for bulk orders from trade union bodies. Hopefully they&#8217;ll be expanding this very useful series on individual work hazards. Journeyman Press (97 Ferme Park Road, London, N8) have issued a paperback edition (75p) of Ignazio Silone&#8217;s fine novel about Italian fascism, <strong>Fontamara</strong>. Also Robert Blatchford&#8217;s classic <strong>Merrie England</strong> (90p). In May, Penguin Books continued their <em>Marx Library</em> series with a new edition of the first volume of <strong>Capital</strong>, at &#163;2.95. This edition has a long introduction by E. Mandel, and includes an extra 136 pages of the so-called &#8216;unpublished chapter&#8217; which has not been easily available previously.</p>

<p>Writers and Readers Publishing Co-operative (14 Talacre Road, London, NW5) have reissued two books by John Berger, the novel <strong>A Painter of our Time</strong>, and the study of a country doctor, <strong>A Fortunate Man</strong>. They have also issued four titles in a series of &#8216;non-sexist children&#8217;s literature&#8217; at &#163;2.50 each. I haven&#8217;t seen these books, but IS readers who are interested could at the minimum get the local library to order them. More details available from the publishers.</p>

<p>Pluto&#8217;s <strong>Big Red Diary</strong> for 1977 is to be on law and disorder. The series is now expanded to a <strong>Big Red Joke Book</strong>, at 90p. This is full of jokes old and new, the best section being (I thought) the East European. Also promised is a <strong>Big Red Song Book</strong>, with music &#8211; what price a <em>Big Red Concert</em> to launch it?</p>
