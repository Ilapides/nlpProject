<b>Revolt and Protest: Student Politics and Activism in Sub-Saharan Africa</b><br/>
<i>Tauris, 2007, &#163;47.50</i></p>

<p class="fst">The revolutions in &#8220;Third World&#8221; countries in the three
decades after 1945 posed some problems for Marxist theory. Leadership
in those revolutions did not come from the &#8220;traditional&#8221;
bourgeoisie. It proved quite as politically incapable as the
bourgeoisies of Germany or Russia, whose behaviour in 1848, 1905 and
1917 provoked the initial formulations of the theory of &#8220;permanent
revolution&#8221;, first by Karl Marx and then by Leon Trotsky. The
bourgeoisie&#8217;s lack of revolutionary leadership was not unexpected.
The age of the &#8220;classic&#8221; bourgeois revolution had ended before 1848.</p>

<p>What permanent revolution proposed, as policy and theory, was that
the struggle for political emancipation &#8211; including national
emancipation from imperial control &#8211; should and could be taken up
and led by working class forces. By asserting their own independent
interests and developing their own specific political forms (from
workers&#8217; parties and militia to soviets) organised workers could,
even while still a minority within underdeveloped capitalist
formations, assert their political leadership over peasants and
artisans, and so begin the process of socialist reconstruction of
society under their own direct control.</p>

<p>However, no such scenario fitted the experience of the post-war
revolutions in &#8220;backward countries&#8221;. Certainly there were cases
in which workers participated in the struggle for national
independence. For example, in Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe and Zambia
general strikes preceded the actual struggle for the transfer of
power from colonial authorities. But nowhere was the actual
revolutionary process marked by the assertion of independent working
class power and organisation. In many cases, indeed, the
revolutionary transfer of power occurred without any significant
working class involvement, as Tony Cliff recorded in his examination
of the revolutions in China, Algeria and Cuba (see the article
<i>Deflected Permanent Revolution</i>, available from
<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1963/xx/permrev.htm" target="new">www.marxists.org</a>).</p>

<p>Writing in 1963, Cliff offered a characterisation of the wave of
Third World revolutions, offering the term &#8220;deflected permanent
revolution&#8221;. Given the weakness of independent working class
organisation, leadership of a whole series of revolutions had fallen
to a social force previously unexpected to play this role. A radical
urban petty-bourgeois intelligentsia took the political initiative
and set out to impose its own vision of societal development.</p>
<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, the focus of Leo Zeilig&#8217;s study, this
national intelligentsia was recruited from the small ranks of
university educated graduates (many of them getting their degrees in
the metropolitan centres, for the colonising powers had held back
university development across Africa), from civil servants working in
the colonial administrations and from the trade union bureaucracy.
According to Zeilig, this group, mostly ex-students, came to see
themselves as &#8220;the liberators of Africa and as uniquely
representing the emergent nation&#8221; (p.&nbsp;31).</p>

<p>If, commonly, they adopted a rhetoric of &#8220;socialism&#8221;, theirs
was a &#8220;socialism from above&#8221; marked by a concern to use the state
as an agency of essentially national development. Cliff characterised
their politics sharply:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;They are great believers in efficiency ... They hope
for reform from above and would dearly love to hand the new world
over to a grateful people, rather than see the liberating struggle of
a self-conscious and freely associated people result in a new world themselves.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p class="fst">Or, as Mahmood Mamdani was to write later,</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Intellectuals ... saw the state and not the class
struggle as the motive force of development ... socialism was turned
into a strategy for economic development, and no more ... From this
perspective, it was difficult even to glimpse the possibility of
working people in Africa becoming a creative force capable of making
history. Rather, history was seen as something to be made outside
this force, in lieu of this force and ultimately to be imposed on it&#8221;
(cited by Zeilig, p.&nbsp;33).</blockquote>

<p class="fst">Across sub-Saharan Africa the situation after independence was
ambiguous in its effects on students. They were commonly seen, and
saw themselves, as the crucial bearers of a vision of national
development. However, the expected benefits of independence were slow
to arrive for the majority of the population. The regimes that
emerged were commonly authoritarian and the gradually expanding
university sector became an important setting for political struggle.
As with student movements elsewhere in the 1960s and early 1970s,
student politics was often explosive yet transitory and still marked
by elitism.</p>

<p>Zeilig&#8217;s study is focused chiefly on student movements in Africa
in the subsequent period. From the mid-1970s the whole economic,
political and social environment changed quite rapidly for the worse.
The world recession had an especially catastrophic effect on Africa.
States that relied chiefly for export income on a few primary
products saw their prices collapse as the cost of their imports rose.
Visions of national state-led capitalist development imploded as
state debts rocketed. Compelled to turn to the IMF and World Bank,
they were to adopt &#8220;structural adjustment policies&#8221; involving
varying degrees of economic liberalisation and privatisation. These,
if they benefited international capital, did little or nothing to
improve the lot of the majority of sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s peoples.
Those majorities bore the brunt of &#8220;adjustment&#8221; in rising food
prices and falling employment.</p>

<p>Those popular majorities provided the social basis for a wave of
&#8220;street demonstrations, marches, strikes and other forms of public
action&#8221; during the late 1970s and 1980s. These rocked the regimes
and provided an important precursor to the anti-globalisation
movement today (p.&nbsp;52).</p>

<p>In the early 1990s the scale and extent of popular protest
activity expanded rapidly, compelling many governments to introduce
reforms and to hold democratic elections. Though insufficiently
noticed, African countries played a key part in the wave of
&#8220;democratic transitions&#8221; that, of course, included those in
Eastern Europe and the former USSR. But the democracy produced has
been weakly developed, not least because popular resistance to state
policies of &#8220;economic liberalisation&#8221; has remained powerful:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;While the demand for economic liberalisation may have
weakened formal democratic structures, in some cases it created an
extraordinarily explosive cocktail of social forces&#8221; (p.&nbsp;58).</blockquote>

<p class="fst">That cocktail included African students. If in the immediate
aftermath of independence students were an actual or aspiring elite,
the same world capitalist forces that drove down popular living and
working standards across the continent also pulled them down. Zeilig
provides a graphic account of the problems afflicting Africa&#8217;s
higher education institutions, from physical decay of buildings to
the slashing of library book and journal stocks, from spiralling
student fees and living costs to overcrowded classrooms and
inadequate teaching. Behind these developments lie World Bank
policies, themselves close to what one critic termed &#8220;academic
exterminism&#8221;. In the process &#8220;university students have seen their
status collapse, along with every other social class. These are
general processes that have seen the decimation of classes previously
regarded as privileged &#8211; teachers, university lecturers, civil
servants and white collar workers&#8221; (p.&nbsp;78).</p>

<p>It is this changed context of social breakdown that makes Zeilig&#8217;s
account of recent student activism across Africa so interesting.
Given the variety of conditions across the continent, any
generalisation must be very provisional. Yet it is clear that
students regularly played a significant role in democratisation
processes. To that we must add that they were most effective when
their own activism succeeded in forcing a wider political opening up,
even where they themselves lacked a clear alternative strategy. As
Mamdani commented, &#8220;Its possibilities depended far more on the
character of forces that student action succeeded in mobilising than
its own internal energies&#8221; (cited, p.&nbsp;90). That conclusion, of
course, fits the French events of May 1968 quite as much as it fits
modern Africa.</p>

<p>From being an elite group, set apart from and &#8220;over&#8221; society,
students &#8211; and the unemployed graduates that many go on to become &#8211;
have become an important part of the popular classes themselves. Here
too there are significant parallels with the &#8220;proletarianisation&#8221;
of students that recent European commentators have recorded. No
longer a tiny &#8220;transitory&#8221; group awaiting jobs in government,
African students have at once expanded their numbers but have also
been &#8220;pauperised, converging more and more with the wider urban
poor &#8211; the social groups they historically saw as their
responsibility to liberate&#8221; (p.&nbsp;91).</p>

<p>This is not to say that student politics have been purged of all
elements of elitism, but now they are tempered by the realities of
campus poverty. African students, however, retain the ability, noted
in other parts of the world, to mobilise and organise more quickly
and effectively than many other social groups. If they cannot by
themselves remake politics, they can and do play a specific
energising role in oppositional politics which has regularly brought
them into conflict with their various regimes.</p>

<p>At the core of Zeilig&#8217;s book are two substantial chapters based
on extensive interviews detailing student activism in Zimbabwe and
Senegal. In 1991 in Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe&#8217;s government introduced
its first full structural adjustment programme, producing a rapid
rise in unemployment accompanied by a cut in exports and growing
inflation. Although it took several years for organised resistance to
mobilise large-scale forces, by the mid-1990s mass strikes, student
demonstrations and food riots began to coalesce against a notoriously
brutal police regime.</p>

<p>There were growing calls on the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions,
led by Morgan Tsvangirai, to form a labour party. But these calls
were soon joined by other, middle class voices. In 1999 the Movement
for Democratic Change (MDC) emerged, but rapidly dissociated itself
from its labour base by supporting further privatisation, with the
union leadership acting to contain and stifle widespread protest activity.</p>

<p>From the second half of the 1990s Zimbabwean students&#8217; formerly
privileged economic position was speedily reduced under a second wave
of structural adjustment policies that slashed grants, expanded loans
and privatised food and accommodation just as prices were soaring.
Student economic demands now coalesced with demands for political
reform, drawing them into links with the trade unions and the
formation of the MDC.</p>

<p>The contradictions and tensions were considerable. Students were
fighting the privatisation of education at the same time that the
MDC, the party they supported, was advocating more of the same. It
was in this context that the small International Socialist
Organisation worked to develop some ideological and practical
clarity, as Zeilig documents at some length. Zimbabwe&#8217;s campuses
were rocked by protests, to which the regime responded with brutal force.</p>

<p>As Zeilig shows, however, a new force now entered the scene, in
the shape of international NGOs, who poured in money to the
opposition, producing what activists termed the &#8220;commodification of
resistance&#8221;, funding expensive conferences and scholarships, and
distorting the structures of indigenous opposition. Students found
themselves isolated and subjected to violent assaults when they
demonstrated on the campus. Zeilig&#8217;s whole chapter is invaluable
for anyone trying to make sense of the current situation in Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>Students in Senegal had their own, less known, &#8220;May events&#8221; in
1968 when student protests coincided with widespread strikes. As
their material situation worsened, economic and political issues also
became intertwined with their waves of protest action. Their most
notable recent role in Senegalese politics occurred in the years 2000
and 2001. To many observers, Senegal after independence had looked
like a one-party state under Senghor and his nominated successor
Diouf. In 2000, however, Abdoulaye Wade, himself a former student
activist, succeeded in capturing the levers of state power in a hotly
contested election. In that election, conducted under the slogan <em>Sopi</em>
(change), students played an indispensable role, fanning out across
the country to mobilise the vote in their towns and villages of origin.</p>

<p>Wade, like the MDC in Zimbabwe, saw his role as continuing
&#8220;structural adjustment&#8221; policies. Within a year those policies
brought him into sharp conflict with the very students who had
campaigned for him in 2000. A student campaign of strikes and
demonstrations, which involved the death of a law student, compelled
Wade to reverse his previous support for World Bank sponsored
cutbacks in university spending. Wade&#8217;s regime, having conceded,
then broke the back of the student movement by buying off its leaders
with overseas scholarships in a local variant of &#8220;commodification
of resistance&#8221;.</p>

<p>If in the countries of advanced capitalism the distinct status of
students has declined, making them a &#8220;student mass&#8221; (Stathis
Kouvelakis) within the workers&#8217; movement rather than a distinct
class, across most of Africa students are still a much smaller
proportion of the population. If many of their previous material
privilege have withered, Zeilig suggests they retain some privileged
autonomy as political actors. Their concentration on the campus and
their unique social situation between two very different social
worlds give them a degree of freedom to act collectively (and be
beaten up!) when other sections of the oppressed are shackled.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the international collapse of the old post-colonial
project of state development and the dominance of structural
adjustment programmes have converted them into &#8220;more modest agents
of social change&#8221; (p.&nbsp;239). Their autonomous role as agents of
transformation often appears in the early stages of popular
mobilisation, but is accompanied by their inability, alone, to carry
through significant social and political transitions. Student
militancy appears most effective when it is directly connected with
struggles by unions and other popular movements &#8211; a process that
reduces students&#8217; special significance.</p>

<p>The collapse of state development projects, along with the
ideological certainties that the Stalinist regimes used to provide,
has generated widespread uncertainty in the realm of radical ideas.
There is a significant dialectic at work here. In Senegal, where
student resistance was less connected than in Zimbabwe to vibrant
popular movements, the level of political analysis among students was
also less developed (p.&nbsp;243). Across sub-Saharan Africa, as in
the rest of the world, the left is struggling to develop new
theoretical accounts of the world and new forms of political practice
that can pose real alternatives to the failures of both state
capitalism and global marketisation. Leo Zeilig&#8217;s book helps
capture many of the dilemmas and possibilities that are emerging.</p>
