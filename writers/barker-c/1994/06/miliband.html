<p class="fst">I only met Ralph Miliband personally towards the end of his life.
However, his books and articles played an important role in the
political development of my generation of socialists. Ralph Miliband
was a very good clear writer &#8211; a real virtue in a period when the
worst academicism often afflicted socialist theorising.</p>

<p>His most important book was surely his first, <strong>Parliamentary
Socialism</strong> (1961). Deservedly, it has been reprinted several times.</p>

<p>The book laid bare the fawning towards British capitalist
institutions that has marked the Labour Party from its beginning.
Labour, after 90 years in parliament, has never made Britain
significantly more democratic. It can&#8217;t even claim it gave votes to
women under 30. Labour, Miliband showed, maintained an unremitting
subservience to crown, imperialism and property.</p>

<p>Periodically a left developed in the party, but it was regularly
sucked into the same habits, or utterly marginalised.</p>

<p>His argument and documentation were brilliant. His book has
sustained and enlightened us all for three decades. But it posed an
obvious question: what&#8217;s the alternative? To that, regrettably, the
author&#8217;s answers were far less adequate.</p>

<p>In 1964, with John Saville, Ralph Miliband launched the annual
<strong>Socialist Register</strong>. In it, he called for the formation of a
new socialist party. But on what principles? Here the weakness of his
position came to the fore.</p>

<p>In 1969, he published <strong>The State in Capitalist Society</strong>. Here
he set out to show that the state in the advanced countries was
inherently capitalist. But the arguments belonged more to &#8216;elite
theory&#8217; than to Marxism, with two major weaknesses. The whole force
of his case rested on the personal connections between state
personnel and the propertied, and their shared prejudices and
culture. The difficulty here is that whole periods of capitalist
history don&#8217;t fit: for example Meiji Japan, Nazi Germany, the
Stalinist states.</p>

<p>Sadly, the book lacked any sense of the class struggle. It
presented a relentless picture of ruling class domination. The waves
of revolt from below that have shaped and transformed capitalist
states do not appear. Even in his account of education, the same
problem appeared. To his credit, Ralph Miliband in 1968 spoke
strongly in defence of the students&#8217; struggle at the London School
of Economics, yet his 1969 book offered an account of higher
education from which classroom struggle is completely absent.</p>

<p>Miliband&#8217;s hatred of inequality and oppression was genuine and
powerful. But what his writings never provide is a concrete sense of
the potential power and creativity of working people in struggle. In
30 years of turbulent world history, <strong>Socialist Register</strong>
managed not to celebrate a single revolutionary struggle in the
advanced world. It missed out on 1968, on Portugal, Iran, Poland.</p>

<p>As a result, Miliband&#8217;s suggestions for new socialist parties
never seemed grounded in any living reality. John Saville&#8217;s
obituary in <strong>The Guardian</strong> (23 May) mentions that, unlike others
of his generation, Ralph Miliband never joined the Communist Party.
Perhaps he was the worse for that. For all its terrible record, the
CP might have given him some sense of the possibilities and
difficulties of socialist organisation, and of the roots of socialism
in everyday struggle.</p>

<p>His best memorial remains <strong>Parliamentary Socialism</strong>. Any
thinking member of the Labour Party who reads it will shudder, or
blush. The beast anatomised there has not changed since 1961, only
become more like Miliband&#8217;s devastating portrait.</p>
