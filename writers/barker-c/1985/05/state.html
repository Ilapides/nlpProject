<p class="fst">MY ARTICLE <a href="../03/state.html" target="new"><em>What Do We Mean by the State?</em></a> in March <strong>SWR</strong> got a bit mangled in editing. An argument I think important disappeared.</p>

<p>Lenin&#8217;s formal definition of the state is insufficient. There is more to the state than &#8216;armed bodies of men&#8217; etc. We shouldn&#8217;t define the state by a characteristic <em>means</em> it employs: violence.</p>

<p>States do useful things. The pensioner going to the Post Office doesn&#8217;t view the state as &#8216;organised violence&#8217;. Nor does the NHS patient, or the consumer of water. The modern state&#8217;s &#8216;useful functions&#8217; strengthen it by making it seem inevitable.</p>

<p>Reformists, who take the state for granted, assume only &#8216;trained experts&#8217;, &#8216;managers&#8217;, etc. can organise key social activities. Their &#8216;socialism&#8217; is always &#8216;from above&#8217;.</p>

<p>Marxists, by contrast, insist society must reclaim control over all its own necessities and functions. This argument applies equally to policing, production, distribution, welfare.</p>

<p>To define the state, we must follow Marx&#8217;s method, and begin with <em>social relations</em>. So, where to start? With the fact, surely, that every state involves one class monopolising key processes of rule-making and rule-enforcement. A society with a state is, by definition, a class-divided society. Those who comprise the state are a class. The existence of a state is an immediate sign of society&#8217;s <em>alienated</em> character. People are still reproducing the means of their own domination.</p>

<p><em>Every</em> state is an impediment to popular self-government. Certainly, every state protects its monopoly by organised violence; but the monopoly itself, not the violence, is the centre of the evil.</p>

<p>This is as true of the &#8216;welfare state&#8217; as it is of the police, army, judiciary, etc. To put the matter extremely, revolutionaries must aim to &#8216;smash the welfare state&#8217;. Lest some daft eejit seek to misunderstand me, of course we don&#8217;t oppose public welfare. But welfare does need to be &#8216;de-statised&#8217;, i.e., made directly subject to popular democratic control. Demands for just such democratisation of all state insitutions &#8211; health services, schools, law and order, etc. &#8211; have played a crucial role in all modern movements with any revolutionary potential. Look at France in 1968, Portugal in 1975, Poland in 1980!</p>

<p>What of a &#8216;workers&#8217; state&#8217; (<em>Letters</em>, <strong>SWR</strong>, April)? Certainly the working class has to establish its own democratic state power. But a &#8216;workers&#8217; state&#8217; has meaning only as what Lenin brilliantly termed a &#8216;semi-state&#8217;, a state whose democratic form permits its dissolution or &#8216;withering away&#8217;. What makes it still a state is that, in <em>some</em> respects, <em>some</em> parts of the population are excluded, in some measure, from control over the running of society. So long as the term &#8216;state&#8217; still fits the situation, there is still hierarchy and subordination in social life.</p>

<p>Marx was an implacable enemy of all forms of &#8216;statism&#8217; &#8211; and not only in respect of &#8216;capitalist&#8217; stages. Socialism is the struggle for the destruction of the state, in <em>all</em> its manifestations and forms. The &#8216;subordination of the state to society&#8217; is not the final goal; our ultimate aim is the removal of all forms of monopolisation of social functions and thus the end of the state <em>in toto,</em> without qualification.</p>
