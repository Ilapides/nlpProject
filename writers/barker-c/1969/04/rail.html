<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/sw-gb/1969/index.html#n0117" target="new">No. 117</a>, 12 April 1969, p.&nbsp;4.<br />

<p class="fst">MANCHESTER:&ndash; Not sacked, &lsquo;displaced&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s the unhappy fate of railwaymen at Central and Exchange Stations, due to close on May 5. No one will be made redundant. Therefore no redundancy pay will be given. &lsquo;Suitable alternative employment&rsquo; will be offered to all the men. Lists of vacancies at a third city station. Victoria, have been published.</p>

<p>The jobs offered at Victoria are not being filled. Railwaymen find that there are no jobs in their existing grades, or the vacancies are for &lsquo;rest day relief men&rsquo;.</p>

<p>A &lsquo;rest day&rsquo; man fills in another worker on his day off. He can be sent anywhere, told to do anything. It&rsquo;s a job British Rail can&rsquo;t usually fill. No one wants it.</p>

<p>If men from Exchange and Central don&rsquo;t take up the jobs offered, then they can be &lsquo;offered&rsquo; work anywhere in the North West Region.</p>

<p><em>And there is no pay for travelling time.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&lsquo;Voluntary&rsquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">The result will be that many railwaymen will leave in disgust, &lsquo;voluntarily&rsquo;. That way, BR will save redundancy pay.</p>

<p>Len Neal of BR has stated in the press that he aims to cut the wage bill nationally by &pound;25m this year. Now we know now.</p>

<p>British Rail can only get away with this because of the weakness of the unions. The rundown of labour can only be understood in the context of last year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Torquay Agreement&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The men on the Manchester stations say the NUR signed the agreement in exchange for the &lsquo;check-off&rsquo; system for union subs. This produces the incredible situation that the LDC representative (railway shop steward) doesn&rsquo;t know who are the paid-up union members, but the station master does!</p>

<p>As one worker remarked. &lsquo;This is the kind of closed shop we don&rsquo;t want.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A railman in Manchester now gets the princely sum of &pound;13 a week, less deductions. Opportunities for overtime have been cut sharply under the Torquay Agreement, as an incentive to men to leave.</p>

<p>To add final insult to injury, the NUR is now talking of raising subs by 1s&nbsp;6d a week ...</p>
