<p class="fst"><strong>Industrial Disputes: Essays in the Sociology of Industrial Relations</strong><br />
J.E.T. Eldridge<br />
<em>Routledge and Kegan Paul, 40s</em></p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;The strategic long-term concerns of the players on the industrial relations stage are no doubt to identify and sustain the areas of common agreement and to regulate the areas of disagreement.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">This conception, although not stated until the very end of his book, underlies the whole of Eldridge&#8217;s collection of essays.</p>

<p>This is not to say that the book is not useful, though perhaps less to socialists than to sociologists. In general the tone and approach is &#8216;realist&#8217; rather than hortatory, which makes a pleasant change in this area. And some of the empirical materiaj is interesting &#8211; especially that on demarcation disputes in shipbuilding.</p>

<p>Generally, in his account of &#8216;industrial relations&#8217;, the emphasis falls heavily on the official postures adopted by the participants (especially the trade unions), and on a restricted area. Even allowing for a bias inherent in his material (drawn largely from the north-east of England) there is too much emphasis on such matters as demarcation disputes, and much less on such things as wage drift, conflicts over discipline and control, etc.</p>

<p>And the relevance of the &#8216;sociological&#8217; references is often doubtful. In common with other contemporary sociologists, Eldridge often describes a particular event or relationship, and then &#8216;generalises&#8217; it by citing some general dictum of a sociologist of the functionalist school (e.g., Coser) as if this provided some additional enlightenment. These dicta rarely, in fact, add much if anything to the data themselves.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most useful section is a review of the literature on strike explanations. This is flawed, however, by a very significant gap. The underlying social relation between employer and worker, the employment &#8216;contract&#8217; itself, is not discussed. Put another way, there is no account of the Marxist contribution.</p>

<p>All in all, the book represents a useful, if limited gloss on the still much more useful, if dated, <strong>Strikes</strong> by Knowles.</p>
