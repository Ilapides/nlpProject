<h2>Colin Barker</h2>

<h1>In Brief</h1>

<h3>(October 1973)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>International Socialism</strong> (1st series), <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index2.html#isj065" target="new">No.&#160;63</a>, Mid-October 1973, p.&#160;32.<br />
Transcribed by Christian H&#248;gsbjerg.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst">A COUPLE of lines slipped out of the last paragraph of this column in our last issue at the proof stage. It should have read: &#8216;Recent paperbacks readers might have missed include Ralph Milliband&#8217;s <strong>The State in Capitalist Society</strong> (Quartet, 60p), and Ernie Robert&#8217;s <strong>Workers Control</strong> &#8211; about which we were a little rude ...&#8217; Apologies to all concerned.</p>

<p>A nice idea for Christmas presents from Pluto Press, whose <strong>Big Red Diary</strong> (75p) should now be in the best shops. Sunday 24 February, even in trade union diaries, is usually noted as &#8216;Sexagesima&#8217; (whatever perversion that may be), but in the <strong>Red Diary</strong> it&#8217;s properly recorded as the day the Tolpuddle Martyrs were arrested. With illustrations, and useful information instead of the normal weights and measures tables, it should do well.</p>

<p>Pluto Press have also published Pat Kinnersly&#8217;s <strong>The Hazards of Work and how to fight them</strong>. If this book is not a best-seller among trade unionists, I&#8217;ll eat many proverbial hats. Trade unionists should note that the bookshop price of 80p need not be paid: there are considerable reductions available for bulk-buyers. A friendly word with your local IS organisation can save your stewards&#8217; committee 40 per cent of the price. Certainly, this book is a MUST.</p>

<p>Some new <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> pamphlets are available, and can be ordered from IS Books: Paul Foot&#8217;s <strong>Workers Against Racism</strong> (10p), Roger Rosewell&#8217;s <strong>The Struggle for Workers&#8217; Power</strong> (10p), and an urgent and hard-hitting pamphlet on the current trial of the 24 North Wales building workers, <strong>Pickets on Trial</strong> (5p). All these pamphlets are real weapons of struggle: to be bought, and sold, and used.</p>

<p>Finally, an item that should have been mentioned in June: International Defence and Aid Fund (104 Newgate Street, London EC1) have published a brief but very useful pamphlet on Namibia, South Africa&#8217;s colony in South West Africa. While its politics are liberal nationalist, it is a very informative account of &#8216;South West Africa, that immense prison&#8217;. Randolph Vigne is the author, the title is <strong>A dwelling place of our own</strong>, and the price is 15p (please add postage).</p>
