<h2>Colin Barker</h2>

<h1>In Brief</h1>

<h3>(May 1973)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>International Socialism</strong> (1st series), <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index2.html#isj058" target="new">No.58</a>, May 1973, p.26.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">A reader asks, &#8216;Why are most of the books you review so expensive?&#8217; A fair question, to which the only fair answer can be &#8216;capitalism&#8217;. Till that small problem is overcome, more comrades might note the existence of the public libraries. Most of these will obtain any book for you, if you press them.</p>

<p>A new publisher, Wildwood House, has an interesting list, including a paperback edition of Moshe Lewin&#8217;s excellent account of <strong>Lenin&#8217;s Last Struggle</strong> against Stalin (April, &#163;1.30). Wildwood House handle a slice of the American paperback publisher, Vintage Books, and are promising Chernyshevsky&#8217;s <strong>What Is To Be Done?</strong> (April, 90p), which gave Lenin his title for that much-quoted and often ill-comprehended little pamphlet; Sartre&#8217;s <strong>Search for a Method</strong> (75p) which Chris Harman reviewed in this journal several years ago, as well as several useful titles on American history and politics. In June, they promise a paperback of Gabriel Kolko&#8217;s <strong>Politics of War</strong> at &#163;1.50; Raymond Challinor enthused about this in a review article in <strong>IS 44</strong> on <a href="../../../challinor/1970/07/coldwar.html" target="new"><em>The Origins of the Cold War</em></a>.</p>

<p>Bill Jordan of the Claimants&#8217; Union is going into print with <strong>Paupers: the Making of the New Claiming Class</strong> (1.60/80p, Routledge), while our very own Jim Kincaid pops up in Penguin in May with a book on inequality in Britain.</p>

<p>Even the most improverished reader should not be without two new IS publications: Roger Kline&#8217;s <strong>Anti-Freeze</strong> (2p), a sharp handbook for trade unionist on Phases One and Two, and the new <strong>Socialist Worker Rents Special</strong> (2p). Both obtainable from IS Books. There are various promises, too: Paul Foot (whose <strong>Fall and Fall of Reginald Maudling</strong> should appear in the summer, writs permitting) on racialism; Granville Williams on reform or revolution; pamphlets on Ireland and on China; and a pamphlet edition of the recent <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> series on strikers and social security.</p>
