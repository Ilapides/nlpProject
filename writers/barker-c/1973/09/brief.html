<p class="info">From <strong>International Socialism</strong> (1st series), <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index2.html#isj062" target="new">No.&#160;62</a>, September 1973, p.&#160;32.<br />

Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">FALLING WALL PRESS (79 Richmond Road, Montpelier, Bristol BS6 5EP) have just published a useful pamphlet by Theo Nichols and Pete Armstrong &#8211; <strong>Safety or Profit: Industrial Accidents and the Conventional Wisdom</strong> (18p plus 5p postage, 15p each post-free for 10 or more). It contains a useful attack on the Robens Committee report, though its recommendations for action by trade unionists are very weak.</p>

<p>Falling Wall Press are also promising an interesting title some time late this year: Huw Beynon&#8217;s <strong>Shop Stewards 1960&#8211;1972</strong>. If Beynon&#8217;s <strong>Working For Ford</strong> (Penguin Education, 90p) is anything to go by, the pamphlet should be very worth looking at. Falling Wall Press&#8217; current list is worth a look, anyway: it includes several low-priced pamphlets on and for the women&#8217;s movement, and a critical bash at Basil Bernstein&#8217;s theories of class and language by Harold Rosen.</p>

<p>Penguin Books are still having a &#8216;sell-to-the-left&#8217; campaign. Their September list includes Leon Trotsky&#8217;s <strong>1905</strong>, which at 75p must be the buy of the month.</p>

<p>Recent paperback readers might have missed include Ralph Miliband&#8217;s <strong>Workers&#8217; Control</strong> &#8211; about which we were a little rude in June &#8211; from Allen and Unwin at &#163;2.25. Pluto Press (see their ad elsewhere in this issue) have an interesting new &#8216;book link&#8217; series they&#8217;re hoping to expand: they&#8217;re offering paper editions of expensive hardbacks of interest to the left. Their first &#8216;book link&#8217; is Rosa Levine-Meyer&#8217;s life of her husband, Levine, which we&#8217;ll be reviewing shortly. Write direct to Pluto for copies (&#163;1.25 plus postage).</p>
