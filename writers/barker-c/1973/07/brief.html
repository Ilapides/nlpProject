<p class="fst">Pelican Books and Allen Lane have announced a <I>Marx Library</I>,
whose first volume appeared on 26 May. The whole of Marx&rsquo;s
<B>Grundrisse</B> in English for the first time is no mean start,
especially at &pound;1.00. For those many readers who may well buy
this book but not read it, Peter Binns will be doing a long review in
a forthcoming issue of <B>IS</B>. One odd facet of this publication
venture is that the paperback has come out before the hardcover
edition, which must prove something.</P>
<P>Church publications don&rsquo;t usually get a puff here, but
exception must be made for Jonathan Power&rsquo;s <B>The New
Proletarians</B> (British Council of Churches, Community and Race
Relations Unit, 10p), a crisp account of the situation of immigrant
workers in Europe. Available, like anything else, through IS Books.</P>
<P>Pluto Press&rsquo;s summer list includes Sheila Rowbotham&rsquo;s
<B>Hidden from History</B>, which I&rsquo;m told contains the
political conclusions that were missing from her Allen Lane book
<B>Women, Resistance and Revolution</B>. Also a study by Werner
Thonnessen on the German women&rsquo;s movements 1863&ndash;1933, an
illustrated study of torture and political persecution in Turkey by
Jane Cousins, a reprint of Lifshitz&rsquo;s <B>The Philosophy of Art
of Karl Marx</B>, and a pamphlet on <B>The Politics of Homosexuality</B>
by Don Milligan. All these were announced for June, though no date
has been set for what may prove to be Pluto&rsquo;s best-seller, a
workers&rsquo; handbook on health and safety at work, edited by Pat
Kinnersly.</p>
