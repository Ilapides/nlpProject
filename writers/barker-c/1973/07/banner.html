<p class="fst"><B>Banner Bright</B><BR>John Gorman, with an introduction by Gwyn
A. Williams<BR><I>Allen Lane, &pound;5.00</I></P>
<P>This handsomely produced book should certainly be ordered for
every public library. It details particular tradition of trade-union
banners, tradition now largely dead: those huge, silk tasselled oil
paintings on poles that have graced union galas and parades for over
a century. Not many of these banners are made today, but at one
period at the end of the 1880s &ndash; after the great dock strike of
1889, &ndash; the manufacturers were rushing them out at more than
one a day. The book ably introduced by Gwyn Williams details the
banners and their makers, though perhaps a little too uncritically.
They are so gorgeous, these great banners, that one cannot help
asking what they were <I>for</I>.</P>
<P>At their peak, the banners symbolised the arrival of the unions in
society. The slogans on the majority are exceptionally conservative:
&lsquo;Defence no Defiance&rsquo;; &lsquo;Let Brotherly Love
Continue&rsquo;; &lsquo;We Provide for the Orphans of our Members&rsquo;,
etc. They celebrate with the view of a labour aristocracy and/or a
workers&rsquo; bureaucracy within capitalism. The union offers itself
to the public gaze as a respectable coffin club, highly moralistic,
drawing on the sentimentalistic school of art characteristic of the
late Victorian Sunday school. A minority of the banners express other
aspirations: Lenin&rsquo;s portrait looks out from the Follonsby and
Chopwell Lodge banners (Durham miners); Southall ASLEF in 1921 showed
a red-shirted worker booting aside the railway bosses beneath the
statement &lsquo;The Power of Unity Breaks Down the Barriers of
Capitalism&rsquo;; a number include a sword-fight scene and &lsquo;He
That Would Be Free Must Strike the Blow&rsquo;; and there are
quotations from the <B>Communist Manifesto</B>, etc.</P>
<P>But the very gorgeousness of the banners creates a doubt &ndash;
they&rsquo;d cost &pound;500 a piece today. Because these are
handsome things (if not to everyone&rsquo;s taste), they are not the
movement&rsquo;s <I>fighting</I> flags. A few have appeared, often at
the cost of their destruction, on militant demonstrations. Generally
they were reserved (today, sometimes, by the insurance companies!)
for parades, outings, occasions. They are, as Gwyn Williams remarks,
Labour&rsquo;s cathedrals. There is another kind of banner that
hardly finds a place here (Except for Tillett&rsquo;s banner, used to
organise the tea operatives in the 1880s, now sewn in as a proud back
for a silk showpiece). The instant emblems, the battle flags, knocked
up in an evening in a back kitchen, are missing.</P>
<P>On the 1963 unemployment demonstration, a stewards&rsquo;
committee banner was draped over an entrance to the House of Commons,
a symbol for socialists of the future. It was a white sheet, with
black lettering, and could be replaced for a few bob. Labour&rsquo;s
cathedrals are crumbling away. If they are to be made again, and
hoisted in their hundreds, the ground will first be cleared by the
home-made flags of struggle.</p>
