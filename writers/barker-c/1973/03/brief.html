<h2>Colin Barker</h2>

<h1>In Brief</h1>

<h3>(March 1973)</h3>

<p class="info">From <strong>International Socialism</strong> (1st series), <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index2.html#isj056" target="new">No.56</a>, March 1973, p.26.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">A notable publication, in late January, was the massive third volume of E.H. Carr&#8217;s <strong>Socialism in One Country</strong> in paperback (Penguin, &#163;2.00), Carr as a historian emerges in the earlier volumes of his <strong>History of the Bolshevik Revolution</strong> as incapable of handling the complexity of working-class movements. Carr is no Trotsky, but as the Russian working class tragically withdraws from the centre of the stage, in the revolution&#8217;s degeneration, so Carr&#8217;s <strong>History</strong> becomes more and more satisfactory. The price, for a paperback, is appalling, though perhaps as the next volume (still to appear in paper covers) costs over &#163;10 in hardcovers, we had better be thankful for small mercies.</p>

<p>Also on the Russia front, Penguin have brought out a small collection of Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s <strong>Stories and Prose Poems</strong> (30p). Some of the material has already appeared in paperback, in two collections, from Sphere Books. The Penguin collection, however, is more complete, and works out cheaper. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>A useful pamphlet, for tenants and all those supporting their struggles, is Dave Burn&#8217;s <strong>Rent Strike: St Pancras 1960</strong> (Pluto Press for Architectural Radicals Students/Educators, 15p). A new pamphlet from the International Socialists, in press at the time of writing, deals, with the present battle against the &#8216;Fair Rent&#8217; Act (watch for the advert in <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>). Tens of thousands of the earlier IS rents pamphlets were sold; don&#8217;t miss this one.</p>
