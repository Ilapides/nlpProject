<h2>Colin Barker</h2>

<h1>In Brief</h1>

<h3>(February 1973)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>International Socialism</strong> (1st series), <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index2.html#isj055" target="new">No.55</a>, February 1973, p.26.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst">Readers should note several useful reprints that have recently appeared. Karl Kautsky&#8217;s <strong>Foundations of Christianity</strong> (Orbach &amp; Chambers, paper covers, &#163;1.75) is still a mine of delights, even if there aren&#8217;t so many customers at the godshop these days. Georg Lukac&#8217;s <strong>Lenin</strong> is now out in paperback (New Left Books, &#163;0.60) &#8211; our original review will stand; it&#8217;s an excellent book, marred only by the author&#8217;s own &#8216;postscript&#8217;. From Dover Books (via Oxford at &#163;1.00) comes Karl Liebknecht&#8217;s <strong>Militarism and Anti-Militarism</strong>. Richard Wright&#8217;s <strong>Native Son</strong> (Penguin, &#163;0.50) reveals how much better a writer and fighter he was than James, Baldwin. And Pluto have launched a new series, <em>Reprints in Labour History</em> with three titles &#8211; Murphy&#8217;s <strong>Preparing For Power</strong> (reviewed in this issue), Tom Mann&#8217;s <strong>What a Compulsory 8 Hour Working Day Means To the Workers</strong> and Gallacher and Campbell&#8217;s <strong>Direct Action</strong> (both &#163;0.20), all with useful introductions by socialist historians. Raymond Challinor, a contributor to this journal, has published <strong>The Lancashire and Cheshire Miners</strong> (Frank Graham, &#163;3.75), which we shall be reviewing in a later issue.</p>

<p>The IRA may be bad for most business, but publishers are making hay. Fontana have Tim Pat Coogan&#8217;s <strong>The IRA</strong> (&#163;0.60) and Sphere Books have brought out J. Bowyer Bell&#8217;s <strong>The Secret Army</strong> (&#163;0.60) and Margery Forester&#8217;s <strong>Michael Collins &#8211; The Lost Leader</strong> (&#163;0.50). All are useful, none provides the analysis that&#8217;s needed.</p>

<p>On the Marxology front, there are rumours of a complete edition of Marx and Engels in 40 volumes emanating from East Berlin in English one of these days. In the meantime, Allen Lane: the Penguin Press are promising a complete edition of the much-mentioned and little-read <strong>Grundrisse</strong> late this year. In the meantime, the industry rolls on: Gill and Macmillan have published John Maguire&#8217;s <strong>Marx&#8217;s Paris Writings: an Analysis</strong> (&#163;3.25), which will prove, with the rest of its tribe, more useful for academic courses on &#8216;Marxism&#8217; than it will for the science of proletarian revolution. Meanwhile Tony Cliff&#8217;s long-awaited <strong>Lenin</strong> is still awaited.</p>
