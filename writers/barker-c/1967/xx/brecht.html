<p class="fst"><strong>The Messingkauf Dialogues</strong><br />
Bertolt Brecht (translated by John Willett)<br />
<em>Methuen, 8s&#160;6d (paper)</em></p>

<p class="fst">More of Brecht&#8217;s writings on the theatre, here in the form of a number of fragmentary dialogues between a Philosopher, a Dramaturg, an Actor and (occasionally) an Actress and a Worker. Once again, Brecht&#8217;s central concern is with the social purpose of the theatre, the ends to which its techniques are turned. All representations of human life contain some purpose, however implicitly; for Brecht the Marxist the purpose must be that of assisting the audience to examine its own existence critically. From this central concern everything else flows: the concern with acting styles, with scenic effects, with the interpretation of the classics, the &#8216;Alienation effect,&#8217; etc.</p>

<p>In particular, Brecht is again at pains to assert that the intellect has a place in the theatre, an intellect that is naturally involved with emotions:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;You provoke all sorts of passions (in the contemporary theatre), but a passion for an argument &#8211; oh no. Indeed, you don&#8217;t even satisfy it when it&#8217;s there.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">The dialogues are in a very fragmentary form, and switch from topic to topic without any clear development of the argument. This is a minor work in the Brecht canon, with little that is not more easily said elsewhere. Nevertheless, it is often witty and provoking, and always interesting. Brecht&#8217;s lack of dogmatism and his real delight in everything to do with the theatre make him essential reading for anyone concerned with the rediscovery of Marxist method in aesthetics &#8211; if not for all the answers, at least for many of the right questions.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;The art of acting is one of society&#8217;s elementary capacities; it is based on a direct social asset, one of humanity&#8217;s pleasures in society; it is like language itself; it&#8217;s really a language of its own. I propose we rise to our feet to make this tribute stick in our memory (<em>All rise</em>) And now I propose we should take advantage of the fact that we&#8217;ve risen to our feet, to go and relieve ourselves.&#8217;</p>
