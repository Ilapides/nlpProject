<p class="fst"><strong>British Politics in Transition</strong><br />
Francis Boyd<br />
<em>Pall Mall, 27s. 6d.</em></p>

<p class="fst">This book is like a hundred others, no better and no worse. British politics take place only at the Top (and, a little, in the constituency parties); changes in the electorate, in terms of shifts of values, a changing class structure, etc, are not considered; there is no discussion of the relations between government and governed. Parliament is of course a splendid institution; the nagging question of the growth in executive power is mentioned, but not incorporated into such analysis as there is. Despite the title, the picture is static: changes can&#8217;t be ignored, but they are strings of unexplained events, rarely coherent processes. Class interests, class conflicts, these do not really exist; even the Tory policy of redistributing wealth to those who have leads Boyd to no stronger conclusion than that the parties sometimes disagree. He <em>notices</em> most of the central changes in the economic structure of Britain, but the relations between these and other changes are not discussed. Generally he gets his facts right &#8211; although his Hungarian revolution took place in November 1957 (pp.113 and 185) and so is unrelated to Suez; and he is simply misleading in stating that the Tories haven&#8217;t weakened the Health Service (p.152). His politicians are all men of moderation and good sense, his book an offering to failed gods. But it&#8217;s dull stuff. Don&#8217;t bother ...</p>
