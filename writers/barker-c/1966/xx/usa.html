<p class="fst"><strong>The First New Nation</strong><br />
Seymour Martin Lipset<br />
<em>Heinemann, 35s</em></p>

<p class="fst">Professor Lipset offers us <em>The United States in Historical and Comparative Perspective</em>. He is, one feels, proud to be an American, but, as a prominent member of an international community of scholars, he mustn&#8217;t be too proud. He must be proud but responsibly worried. That way he has his cake and eats it.</p>

<p>Lipset reveals his wide reading, and also its partiality. At times he is very interesting: his emphasis on the role of &#8216;state capital&#8217; and of foreign investment in the creation of the 19th century capitalist infrastructure is rewarding; and his analysis of the (relatively unchanging) support of Americans for &#8216;religion&#8217; is full of interest. But on the society as a whole he is miles off target.</p>

<p>His missed aim is a function of his basic approach. Lipset takes over from Talcott Parsons and the whole &#8216;normative functionalist&#8217; school of sociology the notion of &#8216;a social system in dynamic equilibrium&#8217;: &#8216;a complex society is under constant pressure to adjust its institutions to its central value system, in order to alleviate strains created by changes in social relations&#8217; (p.7). And, although it is never so crudely stated, his basic thesis is that there is something called a &#8216;central value system,&#8217; born at the time of the 18th century revolution, that has been a prime mover in America ever since. Somehow this is autonomous, a shaper of American lives in its own right. Values, in this analysis, are separated from men&#8217;s actions, and the movement of history becomes obfuscated by terms whose empirical reference changes all the time: Big Words like &#8216;freedom,&#8217; &#8216;democracy,&#8217; &#8216;other direction,&#8217; adorn Lipset&#8217;s pages. In his American history men do not struggle with men as much as values &#8211; &#8216;equality&#8217; <em>vs.</em> &#8216;achievement&#8217; &#8211; threaten each other. Lipset rejects, as he is entitled to do, a crude materialism that, at its crudest, sees poems as the products of power stations. But what he puts in its place is an equally crude idealism, contemporary &#8216;functionalism,&#8217; that claims (most unfairly to poor Max&#8217;s memory) to derive its inspiration from Weber.</p>

<p>The &#8216;sociological emphasis on key values in a social system&#8217; obscures more than it reveals: values are treated as external to men, generalised ideas whose content and power have remained unchanged over 200 years, rather than being seen as men&#8217;s structured purposes, changing over time in both form and content, and differentially shared by different groups that attempt to deal with the problems presented to them by other men&#8217;s actions.</p>

<p>A further consequence of the model employed is that &#8216;the United States&#8217; are somehow sealed off from the activities of Americans in the world &#8211; the limits of the &#8216;social system&#8217; are the geographical boundaries of the nation-state. There is no room for the bombs that fall on Vietnam, or for Vauxhall Motors of Luton, within the &#8216;social system.&#8217; The whole conceptual structure is essentially arbitrary, since it rests not upon the activities of men but upon incantatory phrases drawn from the stockbook of American liberalism.</p>

<p>Lipset&#8217;s book is a useful (but biased) mine of bibliographical references. But despite the many flashes of insight, and the occasional pieces of highly interesting analysis, it reveals more about a highly influential school of American sociological thought than it does about the society it seeks to portray.</p>
