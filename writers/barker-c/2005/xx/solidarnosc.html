<p class="fst">At the end of the 1970s &#8216;People&#8217;s Poland&#8217; was racked by
crisis as it experienced the largest collapse of production yet seen
in any postwar industrial country: GNP fell in 1979 by 2 percent, in
1980 by 8 percent and in 1981 by 15&#8211;20 percent. Public corruption
had become endemic. Popular belief in the regime was at an all-time
low. The housing shortage remained acute; food supplies were a
permanent source of difficulty; Poland was the most polluted country
in Europe; the women of the textile city of Lodz suffered the
continent&#8217;s highest still-birth rate.</p>

<p>On 1 July 1980 a government spokesman announced that better cuts
of meat would in future be available only in the &#8216;free price&#8217;
shops. The announcement was the signal for a wave of strikes that
rolled across most of Polish industry for the next six weeks, to
reach its climax in the coastal cities of Gdansk, Gdynia and Szczecin
in mid-August.</p>

<p>Although the strike movement had no coordinating centre, the
workers had developed an information network by which they spread
news of their struggles. A group of &#8216;dissidents&#8217;, the Committee
for the Defence of Workers (KOR), set up originally in 1976 to
organise aid for victimised workers, drew around them small circles
of working class militants in major industrial centres who produced
and distributed cyclostyled bulletins entitled <strong>Worker</strong>, <strong>Coastal
Worker</strong> and the like.</p>

<p>In August 1980 one of the <strong>Coastal Worker</strong> group in Gdansk, a
50 year old woman crane driver called Anna Walentynowicz, was
victimised by the management at the giant Lenin shipyards. The group
smuggled handwritten leaflets and posters into the shipyard and a few
other workplaces. Their sections stopped work and marched around the
shipyard calling out the rest of the workforce. By the end of the
morning of 14 August a mass meeting was arguing with the shipyard
manager. A member of the group, Lech Walesa, himself sacked from the
shipyard, climbed over the wall, announced himself to the crowd and
declared the start of an occupation strike.</p>

<p>The strike spread rapidly to other local workplaces. Delegates
from these workplaces, including the Paris Commune shipyard in
neighbouring Gdynia and the city&#8217;s tram drivers, gathered in the
Lenin yard. A new body was formed &#8211; the Inter-Enterprise Strike
Committee (MKS), comprising delegates from all striking workplaces in
the region. It formulated a set of demands, the <em>21 Points</em>. No
longer concerned simply with immediate local issues, the list began
with the demand for new, independent trade unions. It went on to call
for relaxation of censorship, new rights for the church, the freeing
of political prisoners and improvements in the health service.</p>

<p>By the Tuesday there were more than 250 enterprises represented on
the Gdansk committee. A news-sheet, <strong>Solidarnosc</strong>, produced on
the shipyard&#8217;s printing press with the assistance of KOR members,
reached a print run of 30,000 copies daily. The authorities cut off
Gdansk from all phone contact with the rest of Poland. News of
Gdansk&#8217;s new organisation and new demands spread rapidly. A further
MKS was established in Elblag, and then in Szczecin, scene of the
mass shipyard occupation of 1971. The regime was forced to agree to
open talks directly with the Gdansk and Szczecin MKS inside the
shipyards. On 31 August in Gdansk, government ministers signed
documents accepting the <em>21 Points</em>.</p>

<p>The movement was based on a huge wave of workplace occupations.
Each striking enterprise sent a delegate to its local MKS. The
delegates elected an inner executive committee, under their immediate
control. The major negotiations with the state were conducted in
front of microphones which were linked into the shipyard tannoy
system so that thousands of workers could follow the proceedings and
assess the progress being made.</p>

<p>Though they did not know it, the Polish workers had reinvented,
out of the logic of their own experience, the organisational form
first adopted by Russian workers in 1905 &#8211; the workers&#8217; council.</p>

<p>Such class organisations have the potential to develop into organs
of revolutionary popular power and become the foundations of a new
social order. However, that potential is not automatically realised &#8211;
for the MKS to in this direction, its members would need to be able
to see the potential. In Poland in 1980 no significant body existed
to propose any such notion. Rather, from the beginning, the MKS
consciously limited its aspirations.</p>

<p>Numbers of intellectual &#8216;advisers&#8217; were incorporated into the
circle around the MKS leadership. Their role was predominantly to act
as the advocates of compromise. The church hierarchy too preached
moderation. At the height of the strikes Cardinal Wyszynski delivered
a widely broadcast sermon effectively calling for an end to the occupations.</p>

<p>Three weeks after the Gdansk agreements delegates from the various
MKSs held their first national meeting. They called their new union
NSZZ &#8216;Solidarnosc&#8217; (Independent Self-Governing Union Solidarity).
By late autumn something like 10 million members were registered.
This was some 80 percent of the total Polish workforce.</p>
<p>Solidarity changed its members. The very act of participating in a
founding meeting, often in defiance of local bosses, involved a
breach with old habits of deference and submission. New bonds of
solidarity and a new sense of strength were forged. All over the
country, this process involved strikes and other conflicts. Far from
the Gdansk agreements having ended battles between workers and the
regime, they merely opened the door to a swelling flood of popular
demands and sharp regional and national conflicts. For seven months
after August the Solidarity tide continued to rise.</p>

<p>There was in reality an incipient &#8216;dual power&#8217; situation. On
one side stood the regime, still holding the major levers of official
economic and political power and still firmly in control of the
forces of repression (the security police and the army in
particular). But the normal mechanisms of control over the mass of
the population were rapidly breaking down. The regime was isolated,
regarded with openly articulated scorn and contempt. Against it stood
Solidarity &#8211; a flooding torrent of popular power and aspirations,
growing in confidence, and centred on the huge regionally-based
delegate bodies that comprised the workers&#8217; union.</p>

<p>Everyone looked to Solidarity for a lead. This was a dilemma for a
movement that did not aspire to power. The union leaders&#8217; response
was to seek to stem the onward march of their own side.</p>

<p>In March a massive crisis erupted in the city of Bydgoszcz.
Solidarity members occupying an office went to the local prefecture
to negotiate with party representatives. A couple of hundred police
invaded the room and systematically beat up the Solidarity men, among
them a national leader of the union, Jan Rulewski. This was the first
time open force had been used against the union. Half a million
workers across the whole Bydgoszcz area erupted into strike. By the
time a national delegate meeting, 300-strong, was held on 23 March,
the pressure coming from the grassroots for national action was
overwhelming. A highly successful national four-hour strike was
accompanied by preparations for an unlimited general strike which
would begin on 31 March if the union&#8217;s demands were not met.</p>

<p>The atmosphere in Poland was electric, as both sides prepared for
a decisive confrontation. Strike headquarters were designated in the
largest factories in each region, fortified with barricade materials.</p>

<p>The premier, Jaruzelski, turned to the church for support. Direct
pressure was applied to Lech Walesa through an hour&#8217;s private
meeting with the cardinal, and at the last moment Walesa appeared on
TV to announce the strike was called off.</p>

<p>The general strike&#8217;s sudden cancellation was a serious setback,
throwing the union back on itself. The aftermath saw a partial
demobilisation of the membership. For more than three months there
were no strikes. Attendance at union gatherings declined.</p>

<p>The economic crisis deepened in the spring and summer of 1981. The
supply of everyday goods was steadily worsening. Meat rations were
cut, and soap, detergent, toilet paper were all in short supply. The
crisis provoked a new eruption of working class protest. The response
of the leadership was cool and sometimes hostile. When the regime
alleged that Solidarity was sabotaging the economy, the leadership
called for a two-month moratorium on strikes. At one point in late
September two thirds of Poland&#8217;s provinces were affected by
strikes. These upsurges from below remained fragmented and
incoherent, isolated from each other. No section of the leadership
attempted to link them together, showing how they might be combined
in a new assault on the regime. Eventually, from mid-November, the
strike wave died down &#8211; the membership was increasingly exhausted,
turning away in disappointment from the union.</p>

<p>The regime began taking open offensives against Solidarity
activists, testing the union&#8217;s readiness to fight back. Small army
squads were sent out into the countryside and the smaller towns.
Similar units were sent out to the factories &#8216;to check on civil
defence preparations&#8217;. Then, on 2 December, hundreds of ZOMOs (riot
police) smashed their way into the Warsaw Firefighting School, which
was occupied by students demanding the right to join the union. The
regime had deployed open force against Solidarity.</p>

<p>On 12 December the union&#8217;s national commission met in Gdansk, in
the most radical mood since before Bydgoszcz. The delegates voted
that they would oppose emergency powers legislation with strikes,
including a general strike. As the national commission members slept
in their hotel that night the regime struck. The hotel was surrounded
and invaded by riot police, the delegates arrested and interned. Up
and down the country thousands of Solidarity activists were seized in
their beds and dragged away. At six o&#8217;clock on Sunday morning
Jaruzelski announced his military coup, the suspension of Solidarity
and martial law. Cardinal Glemp broadcast an appeal for people not to
fight back. The workers&#8217; response to the coup was patchy. There
were a couple of hundred strikes and occupations, chiefly in the
largest plants and in several of the Silesian coalmines. After a few
days, they were broken by brutal police and army interventions. Nine
workers were killed at the Wujek mine.</p>
