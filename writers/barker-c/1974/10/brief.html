<h2>Colin Barker</h2>

<h1>In Brief</h1>

<h3>(October 1974)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>International Socialism</strong> (1st series), <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index2.html#isj072" target="new">No.72</a>, October 1974, p.32.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst">CHRISTOPHER FARMAN&#8217;s <strong>The General Strike</strong> is now out in paperback, at &#163;1.00, from Panther Books. This journal should have reviewed it when it came out in hardback, except that the reviewer absconded with the book. According to all accounts, including that in <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, it is a useful book to have around.</p>

<p>Pluto Press has an interesting autumn and winter programme. Due out any time now is Michael Kidron&#8217;s collection of essays, <strong>Capitalism and Theory</strong> (&#163;1.50 paperback). Many of the essays appeared in old issues of this journal, are now out of print, and still worth reading. There are two new essays, on <em>Waste</em>, and on modern imperialism, which are a must, although far from easy reading.</p>

<p>October promises well, with a reissue of Tony Cliff&#8217;s most original and enduring contribution to Marxist theory, <strong>State Capitalism in Russia</strong> (&#163;1.00 paperback); Chris Harman&#8217;s <strong>Bureaucracy and Revolution in Eastern Europe</strong>, a mighty labour (&#163;1.50 paperback); and the <strong>Minutes of the Bolshevik Central Committee</strong> in the actual process of the revolution (&#163;2.70 paperback). Also due are three plays by Steve Gooch, 1975&#8217;s <strong>Big Red Diary</strong> (on the theme of 1945, the year that saw our very unbright new world stagger out of Hot War), and a cheap edition of Sheila Rowbotham!s <strong>Hidden from History</strong> (75p). Sheila&#8217;s <strong>Women, Resistance and Revolution</strong>, incidentally, has just been paperbacked by Penguin Books this month, at 60p, as has the full edition of that masterpiece of satire, <strong>The Good Soldier Sveyk</strong> (&#163;1.25).</p>

<p>Back to Pluto. In January comes the second of their <em>Workers&#8217; Handbooks</em>. Pat Kinnersly&#8217;s <strong>Hazards of Work</strong> has, by any standards, been a best seller. It will be joined, hopefully with equal success, by Christopher Hird&#8217;s <strong>Your Employer&#8217;s Profits: a Workers&#8217; Guide to Company Accounts</strong>. Like <strong>Hazards</strong>, this will cost 90p in bookshops, and less in bulk orders. Also out in January, the first volume of Tony Cliff-s long-awaited, everlastingly announced <strong>Lenin</strong>. Volume One is entitled <em>Building the Party</em>. Two more volumes will follow, the second on the October Revolution, and the third on the revolution&#8217;s isolation and defeat.</p>
