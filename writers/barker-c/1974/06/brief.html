<h2>Colin Barker</h2>

<h1>In Brief</h1>

<h3>(June 1974)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>International Socialism</strong> (1st series), <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index2.html#isj070" target="new">No.70</a>, Mid-June 1974, p.32.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">Pluto Press have an important book out in July, a translation of a text by a Chilean revolutionary, Juan Prieto, on the latter days of the Allende government. It is a detailed and scathing attack on the politics of reformism, the suicidal logic by which the Communist Parties of the world in particular have &#8211; against all experience &#8211; urged the continuance of the &#8216;parliamentary road to socialism&#8217;. Provisionally titled <strong>The Gorillas are among us</strong>, Prieto&#8217;s book is. essential reading. Pluto are rushing to get it out, readers should rush to get it in.</p>

<p>Already out from Pluto is Martin. Shaw&#8217;s <strong>Marxism versus Sociology</strong> (90p). Sociology students will find this bibliography of Marxist writings useful, though the wisdom of printing rather than duplicating the text seems doubtful. More interesting, in the long run, will be Martin&#8217;s promised book on the subject.</p>

<p>New Park Publications have published Zinoviev&#8217;s <strong>History of the Bolshevik Party</strong> (&#163;1.50) and Preobrazhensky&#8217;s <strong>From NEP to Socialism</strong> (&#163;1.25), both of them important texts dating from 1923. (From IS Books, 265 Seven Sisters Road, London N4 or direct from 186a Clapham High Street, London SW4 7UG).</p>

<p>There is now a steady and welcome trickle of &#8216;Handbooks&#8217; for those seeking social security benefits. The latest, .and most up-to-date, is the Child Poverty Action Group&#8217;s Rights <strong>Guide for Unemployed Workers and Strikers</strong>, available from CPAG, 1 Macklin Street, London WC2 (30p, 15p to claimants). This one has the new (June 1974) benefit levels.</p>

<p>A couple of paperbacks interested readers may have missed: Joyce Mallow&#8217;s <strong>The Tolpuddle Martyrs</strong> (Panther, 75p) and Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s <strong>Letter to Soviet Readers</strong> (Fontana, 35p).</p>

<p>International Defence and Aid Fund (104 Newgate Street, London EC1) have published <strong>Sun Will Rise: Statements from the Dock by South African Political Prisoners</strong> (20p) and Alexander Hepple&#8217;s <strong>Press Under Apartheid</strong> (25p).</p>
