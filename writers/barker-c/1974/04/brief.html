<h1>In Brief</h1>

<p class="info">From <strong>International Socialism</strong> (1st series), <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index2.html#isj068" target="new">No.68</a>, April 1974, p.32.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">Spokesman Pamphlets have recently published <strong>Profit Trends and Price Controls</strong> by John Hughes. Readers who looked at Glyn and Sutcliffe&#8217;s <strong>British Capitalism, Workers and the Profits Squeeze</strong> (Penguin, 1972) will find this a most useful corrective to the analysis offered there. Hughes argues &#8211; successfully, it seems to me &#8211; that the evidence for falling profits in British business is at best tenuous. He shows how the official figures obscure the reality of the situation. At 24p it&#8217;s worth a look.</p>

<p>Spokesman, whose publications we have had cause to criticise sharply in the past, have announced a most interesting series, to appear during 1974. Under the general title <em>European Socialist Thought</em>, they will be publishing three books by Serge Mallet and one by Lucien Goldmana The first title in the series will be Mihailo Markovic&#8217;s <strong>The Contemporary Marx</strong>. Markovic is a Yugoslav Marxist, a colleague of Stojanovic, whose <strong>Between Ideals and Reality</strong> was reviewed in last month&#8217;s <strong>International Socialism</strong>. Hopefully paperback editions of these books will be available.</p>
