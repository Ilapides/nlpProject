<h1>Origins and Significance of the Meiji Restoration</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="fst">Japan is today the world&#8217;s third largest industrial power, measured in terms of gross national product. Yet, in the mid-19th century, the Japanese economy was at a level not dissimilar to that in England under the later Tudors. The story of Japanese industrial growth is quite spectacular.</p>

<p>The present notes do not deal with the whole history of industrialising Japan. What is dealt with here is just one problem: the &#8220;political revolution&#8221; of 1868 through which Japan was converted from a &#8220;traditional&#8221; to a &#8220;modern&#8221; state. That process is, I hope, sufficiently interesting to merit consideration in its own right. I have quoted extensively and shamelessly from other authors.</p>

<p>I hope some time to add one additional section, dealing at least briefly with the consequences for Japanese development of the peculiar form of its &#8220;revolution from above&#8221;. In the meantime, anyone interested is recommended in particular to look at Ellen Kay Trimberger, <strong>Revolution From Above</strong>, especially pp.&nbsp;105&ndash;138, or at the article by the same author.</p>

<p>The bibliography at the end lists the sources I have used, in each case indicating &#8211; if the item is available within the Polytechnic library system &#8211; where it may be obtained.</P>
<P>This handout was produced in a great rush, and no doubt suffers from the circumstances of its production. Any comments, queries, criticisms and the like will be more than welcomed by</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>Postscript</strong> (1991). Over the years since this paper was originally drafted, there has been a tremendous amount of new material published in English, as Japanese studies have &#8211; very properly &#8211; expanded. There is a good listing of recent work in the Bibliography to the recent book by Janet E. Hunter: <strong>The Emergence of Modern Japan: An Introductory History since 1853</strong> (Longman 1989). There is a very useful theoretical and comparative discussion of some of the issues posed by the Meiji Restoration in Alex Callinicos, <em>Bourgeois revolutions and historical materialism</em>, <strong>International Socialism 43</strong>, June 1989. Also of interest is Germaine A. Hoston, <strong>Marxism and the Crisis of Development in Pre-war Japan</strong>, Princeton University Press, 1986</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>Postscript</strong> (2001). The volume of materials appearing over the past ten years has been tremendous. I have not managed to keep up with them. But any modern reader should look out for the multi-volumed <strong>Cambridge History of Japan</strong>, which contains large amounts of really excellent materials.</p>
