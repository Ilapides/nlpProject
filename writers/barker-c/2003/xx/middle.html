<strong>Forging Democracy: The History of the Left in
Europe, 1850&#8211;2000</strong><br/>
<em>Oxford University Press, 2002, Â£25</em></p>

<p class="fst">In 1985 Geoff Eley, with David Blackbourn, co-authored <strong>The
Peculiarities of German History</strong>. That book represented an
important contribution to Marxist thinking, not just about 19th
century German history, but about how we should understand &#8216;bourgeois
revolutions&#8217;. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> In the intervening years Eley has produced a
steady flow of articles and books on the history of Germany, the
working class, popular culture, and the work of prominent Marxists
like Christopher Hill and Edward Thompson. It was thus with some
anticipation that I opened his 698&#8211;page book, dealing with the
interlinked themes of the development of democracy and of the left in
Europe over the past century and a half.</p>

<p>The author tells us that he produced this volume over the last 20
years. He was writing during the 1980s and 1990s, in a period that
significantly reshaped the European and world left, when it was
peculiarly difficult for socialists to maintain their bearings. The
events of that period &#8211; the large defeats suffered by centrally
important groups like the Italian Fiat workers or the British miners,
the rise and fall of various parliamentary and extra-parliamentary
left movements including the 1980s peace movement, the apparent
prominence of &#8216;new social movements&#8217;, the collapse of &#8216;communism&#8217;
in Eastern Europe and the former USSR, and the drive towards
neo-liberalism by the parties of social democracy (and above all the
Blair-led New Labour Party) &#8211; could easily depress socialists or
lead them astray. Certainly the sense they made of those decades
necessarily informed how they thought about the history of their own
movements. As he acknowledges, Geoff Eley has been marked by the
period of his own research and writing. The views he formed then have
shaped his history.</p>

<p>Any serious review of this ambitious book must, therefore, be
political. If I locate serious problems in <strong>Forging Democracy</strong>,
my argument is almost entirely not with Eley&#8217;s &#8216;facts&#8217;, but
with the pattern he has found in them, the lessons he has drawn, and
the issues he has emphasised as well as those he has neglected. On a
number of critical matters, there are major differences between Eley
and the tradition broadly represented by this journal.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Themes</h4>

<p class="fst">There are several repeating themes running through Eley&#8217;s book.
On the first of these we can open with agreement. Between 1860 and
2000, as Eley suggests:</p>

<p class="quoteb">... the most important gains for democracy have only ever
been attained through revolution, or at least via those several
concentrated periods of change I&#8217;ll call the constitution-making
conjunctures of modern European history. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> Let there be no mistake:
democracy is not &#8216;given&#8217; or &#8216;granted&#8217;. It requires conflict,
namely, courageous challenges to authority, risk-taking and reckless
exemplary acts, ethical witnessing, violent confrontations, and
general crises in which the given sociopolitical order breaks down.
In Europe, democracy did not arise from natural evolution or economic
prosperity. It certainly did not emerge as an inevitable by-product
of individualism or the market. It developed because masses of people
organised collectively to demand it. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">To this we should add that democracy in Europe has also been a
fragile, contested, unfinished and relatively recent growth. Not only
have democratic advances occurred via major political crises, so too
have the sometimes crushing defeats which the struggle for democracy
in Europe has experienced: think only of the victories of Mussolini,
Hitler or Franco between the wars, of Stalinist reaction across
Eastern Europe after 1945, or the Greek colonels&#8217; coup.</p>

<p>There have, Eley argues, been five moments in European history of
&#8216;transnational constitution-making&#8217;, each of which laid down
possibilities and limits for decades afterwards. The first,
1789&#8211;1815, lies outside his book&#8217;s remit. The other four were
1869&#8211;1871, 1914&#8211;1923, 1943&#8211;1949, and 1989&#8211;1924. In practice,
Eley doesn&#8217;t hold very firmly to this list, spending some space,
for example, in considering the &#8216;political explosions of 1968&#8217;.
But his general argument is surely right: history moves between
periods when nothing fundamental seems to change and when politics
seems to become &#8216;the machinery of maintenance and routine&#8217;, and
other periods when:</p>

<p class="quoteb">... things fall apart. The given ways no longer persuade.
The present loosens its grip. Horizons shift. History speeds up. It
becomes possible to see the fragments and outlines of a different
way. People shake off their uncertainties and hesitations; they throw
aside their features. Very occasionally, usually in the midst of a
wider societal crisis, the apparently unbridgeable structures of
normal political life become shaken. The expectations of a slow and
unfolding habitual future get unlocked. Still more occasionally,
collective agency materialises, sometimes explosively and with
violent results. When this happens, the formal institutional worlds
of politics in a nation or a city and the many mundane worlds of the
private, the personal and the everyday move together. They occupy the
same time. The present begins to move. These are times of
extraordinary possibility and hope. New horizons shimmer. History&#8217;s
continuum shatters. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">We need not discuss here how and why such dramatic shifts in tempo
and possibility occur, what matters is that they do happen. Leaps and
jumps in development, political and social crises, unexpected
transformations are normal in history, and they affect the way that
socialists, above all, respond to the past, the present and the future.</p>

<p>The other recurring themes present some difficulties, which we
shall need to pick up at appropriate points. One concerns gender and
class. Left politics, Eley suggests, has been centred around &#8216;the
traditional imagery of the male worker in industry&#8217; <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> and this
imagery has weakened the left both theoretically and strategically.
Several problems arise. The European left&#8217;s approach to what an
earlier generation termed &#8216;the woman question&#8217; has, he proposes,
been consistently flawed, so that the very term &#8216;class&#8217; itself
has been identified in &#8216;masculine&#8217; terms. In practice this has
often weakened the left&#8217;s assessment of and struggle for democratic
advance. Additionally, Eley suggests that the &#8216;centrality of the
working class&#8217; has been &#8216;deconstructed&#8217; in contemporary social
and economic thought, and this leads him to ask what happens if we
&#8216;dethrone&#8217; the working class from its privileged primacy in
socialist politics at various periods in the past? In this, he draws
inspiration from &#8216;feminist critiques of &#8220;class-centred&#8221;
politics&#8217;, as these developed in the 1970s. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a second, problematic theme concerning Eley&#8217;s account
of what some rather critical terms &#8211; notably &#8216;the left&#8217; and
&#8216;socialism&#8217; &#8211; should be taken to mean, and what and who should
be included in and excluded from them. These issues were, of course,
themselves very much contested across Europe during the period
covered by <strong>Forging Democracy</strong>, and the author&#8217;s own stance
with respect to these debates cannot but affect his historical treatment.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a final theme, although it is not openly stated in the
introductory pages. Faced with a variety of crises, in which the left
found itself divided and arguing furiously, Eley&#8217;s instinct is to
seek some middle path between the contending forces. Closely
connected with this, not surprisingly, is Eley&#8217;s generally
unsympathetic rendering of the Leninist tradition, and indeed a not
very convincing account of the politics of Marxism generally.</p>
<p>This review will follow the broad organisation of Eley&#8217;s book
into four sections.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>


<h4>1860&#8211;1914</h4>

<p class="fst">The 1860s represent a useful starting point for the history of the
left and democracy in Europe. The decade saw a series of state
reorganisations across the world, whose effects would be felt for the
next century. Serfdom was abolished &#8216;from above&#8217; in Tsarist
Russia, Italy and Germany were unified from above, Canada gained its
federal constitution, the North won the Civil War in America and
abolished slavery, and the Meiji Restoration set Japan on the path to
rapid capitalist development. The British parliament, through the
Second Reform Act and the Education Act, gave some male workers the
vote and provided for a national state education system. All the
major states which were to play prominent roles as Great Powers in
inter-imperialist conflicts in the 20th century underwent significant
political changes between 1860 and 1870.</p>

<p>The formation of unified and relatively liberalised national
states was, as Eley notes, a necessary preliminary to the struggle
for democracy. It was in the new world of large nation-states in late
19th century Europe that modern socialist movements emerged. As
industrial capitalism and its system of states developed, so too did
the content of popular demands for democracy:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Gradually and unevenly, democracy became linked to two
new demands: an economic analysis of capitalism and a political
programme for the general reorganising of society. The new ideas
didn&#8217;t inevitably follow from socioeconomic change. But in the most
general way, changes in the democratic idea clearly had this material
source. They resulted from the serious efforts of political thinkers,
and countless ordinary men and women, to understand the disruptions
of their accustomed world. It was in that moment of transformation
that people began exploring the possibilities of collective ownership
and co-operative production. And in that juncture of socioeconomic
change and political rethinking the ideas of socialism were born. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In that process, the prefix &#8216;social&#8217; was attached to
&#8216;democracy&#8217; to define a distinctive working class politics. And
the term &#8216;social democracy&#8217; implied a new form of society,
contrasted sharply with emerging capitalism: &#8216;It came to mean &#8220;an
idea of society as mutual cooperation&#8221;, as opposed to one based on
&#8220;individual competition&#8221;.&#8217; <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> Private property itself came to
be identified as the source of social ills.</p>

<p>Two intimately interlinked questions were naturally posed. First,
how should this new social democratic vision be realised? Second,
what content should be given to this vision?</p>

<p>So far as the first question was concerned, the predominant
solution adopted across Europe involved the creation of new, social
democratic parties. These, Eley suggests, displaced older forms:
notably local workers&#8217; associations and clubs on the one hand, and
&#8216;Blanquism&#8217; on the other. Where they were successful, the new
parties absorbed workers&#8217; associations, around a new project. If
only working people could gain the vote, then universal suffrage
should permit a parliamentary majority to institute social democratic
change. The newly emerging socialist parties were a realisation of a
broad democratic vision, which focused working class political
energies on parliamentary politics.</p>

<p>Looking back from the early 21st century, it seems improbable that
such a project could catch fire with millions of people. Plenty of
people today think politics is restricted to parliamentarism, but
true believers in &#8216;parliamentary socialism&#8217;, who still seriously
see this as a means to uproot the whole social foundation of
capitalism, are quite few. In that sense, someone like Tony Benn is
relatively unusual. But before 1914 such ideas could enjoy wide
appeal. Nor is this surprising. In the 19th century most male workers
were still excluded from the suffrage, as of course were all women.
What could be more natural than the assumption that, if the ruling
class denied you the vote, acquiring it could be a powerful means to
both oppose them and remake society?</p>

<p>Eley mostly interprets the growth of social democratic parties as
a &#8216;forward march of labour&#8217;. He is, surely, broadly correct in
his positive presentation of the &#8216;socialist model of the mass
party, campaigning openly for public support and parliamentary
representation on a national scale, and organising its own affairs by
the internal democracy of meetings, resolutions, agreed procedures,
and elected committees&#8217;. This was &#8216;the crucial democratic
breakthrough of the 19th century&#8217;s last four decades&#8217; &#8211; it was
&#8216;the vital departure&#8217;. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>There is, however, a curious gap in his story, in that he does not
pay much attention to the interrelation between the pursuit of
parliamentary victories and questions of trade unionism and workplace
struggle. The pre-1914 decades witnessed a considerable growth in
union membership and activity across Europe, in part absorbing the
forces which were previously drawn into &#8216;workers&#8217; associations&#8217;.
As both national trade union structures and the social democratic
parties grew, they fostered each other&#8217;s development. (The patterns
of development, though, did not follow the same order in each
country. While the Labour Party in Britain was largely the creation
of the unions, in Germany the order was reversed.) In a book focused
on the relation between the left and democracy, Eley&#8217;s relative
inattention to trade unionism &#8211; which marks his whole book &#8211;
means that he never very directly addresses the complex of
theoretical and practical issues about struggles over authority and
thus democracy within the capitalist workplace. Yet the &#8216;despotic&#8217;
power of employers and their managerial apparatus, from bullying,
racist and sexist supervisors to the &#8216;scientific&#8217; managers who
tried to squeeze ever more surplus value from workers, were as much a
source of trade unionism&#8217;s attraction as questions of wages alone.
The struggle to control the exercise of capitalist power in and
around the workplace posed issues quite as important for democracy &#8211;
especially for the left &#8211; as did suffrage questions. To be sure,
the growth of union bureaucracies and their increasing domination of
union agendas did, very often, divert attention away from such
matters &#8211; but they also regularly resurfaced, manifesting
themselves not least in periodic contests between rank and file
members and their officials.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Eley never mentions these matters. He
observes the way trade unionism&#8217;s mass basis made it an important
factor in national life, and notes the rise in the strike statistics
in the immediate pre-1914 period. As he remarks &#8211; though it will
play less part in his overall narrative &#8211; the 1905 Revolution in
Russia inextricably linked questions of work and democracy, wages and
citizenship. And he does record both the costs of top-heavy
centralism in labour movements, and also the way that it in turn
became a big spur to unofficial militancy. He also remarks that the
conundrum of &#8216;reconciling the case for centralism with the demands
of internal democracy and grassroots militancy ... would become the
source of enormous internal conflict&#8217;. They would, as he remarks,
underpin &#8216;rival visions of socialism&#8217;. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p>What Eley suggests is that, in the consolidated organisation of
social democratic parties and unions, something got lost along the
way &#8211; in particular, the valuable aspects of the legacy of the
utopian socialists of the earlier 19th century. The utopians
(Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen, Cabet and others) did, in practice,
retreat into apolitical and often outlandish forms of experimental
community building; often they were silent on how a real transition
to a new society might be achieved; and they tended to be indifferent
to political economy and the structural origins of class-based
inequality. Social democrats after the 1860s explicitly repudiated
the utopians here. However, there were other sides to the utopian
legacy. One was the focus on producer co-operatives and &#8216;social
workshops&#8217;, tied to a vision of self government. That part of the
utopian legacy did not, I suggest, so much disappear as transmute and
reappear on an immensely larger scale, no longer attached to
experimental communities but as part of the 20th century repertoire
of revolutionary workers&#8217; movements &#8211; most notably in the
workers&#8217; councils and soviets.</p>

<p>What Eley, however, especially laments is the loss of the &#8216;radical
politics of gender&#8217; that characterised the early utopians: the
critiques of marriage and of the family, of patriarchal relations
between men and women, of the absence of mutuality and equality
between the sexes. The second half of the 19th century witnessed a
double movement, in which working class organisations came to accept
the given basis of the wage relation and to organise and bargain
collectively within this &#8211; learning the rules of the market game,
as Hobsbawm expressed it &#8211; and at the same time tried to construct
a form of family life fitted to this reality. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> Its ideal
assumption was a worker-husband who left every morning to earn a
family wage while the wife remained behind doing household tasks and
bringing up the children. Outside the skilled and better paid layers,
this was often no more than a dream, for most working class wives
continued to earn money when and how they could. This pattern of
adjustment to the pressures of working class life in capitalist
society had the effect of remaking the &#8216;traditional&#8217; dependence
of women on men. In the process, as Eley puts it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">... commitment to gender equality was lost. Visions of
sexual freedom and alternatives to the patriarchal family were pushed
to the dissident edges of the labour movements. Women were no longer
addressed by means of an independent feminist platform but were
treated either as mothers or potential workers. The early belief in
sexual equality (&#8216;women&#8217;s petty interests of the moment&#8217;, as
the German social democrat Clara Zetkin put it) became swallowed into
the class struggle. Or, as Eleanor Marx exhorted in 1892, &#8216;We will
organise not as &#8220;women&#8221; but as proletarians ... for us there is
nothing but the working class movement&#8217;. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In Eley&#8217;s account, &#8216;By choosing certain strategies of
community defence over others, working class radicals shaped an
enduring ideology of domesticity, limiting effective citizenship to
men&#8217;. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> And, as part of that process, they constructed an image
of the working class itself, centred on the figure of the male manual worker:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Across industrialising Europe, the ideal of the household
managed by the nonworking wife was available only to a minority.
Women&#8217;s earning power may have been vital to working families, but
its status was practically and explicitly devalued. Thus in building
the collective ideal of the working class &#8211; in shaping the
disorderly facts of industrialisation into a basis for politics &#8211;
socialists embraced only some parts of working class life while
derogating others. In the centring of class identity, some working
class experiences became valorised, others ignored or effaced ...
Labour movements institutionalised precisely the systems of
distinction that were least conducive to a genuinely inclusive and
gender-blind working class political presence. While invoking the
interests, authority, and collective agency of the working class as a
whole, those movements were actually far more narrow and
exclusionary. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p>The world of the skilled trade unionist did not encompass the
&#8216;authentic&#8217; working class, any more than did that of the
unskilled and unorganised labourers of pre-1914 Europe. What the left
needed to do was to devise a politics for both, and to organise:</p>

<p class="quoteb">on two fronts of social dispossession: the working men&#8217;s
experience of long weary walks to work, exhausting labour,
occupational injuries and diseases and grim periods of unemployment;
and the lives of their wives at their own paid jobs, in local
markets, dealing with landlords, charities and state institutions.
The term &#8216;labour movements&#8217; often implicitly suggested that the
former was their province.</p>

<p class="fst">In Eley&#8217;s reading, not until the 1960s would any proper recovery
of the utopian legacy with respect to gender occur. He ties that
recovery to the flowering of a new feminism.</p>

<p>It is undeniable that there is some truth in the story Eley tells.
But he rather skates over the complexities, in offering an account in
which &#8216;the woman question&#8217; was always subordinated and even
ignored in the pursuit of a &#8216;class politics&#8217; that was resolutely
masculinist. Socialism itself, he suggests, became &#8211; both in its
vision and in the instruments shaped to fight for it &#8211; a one-sided
male affair. There is a peculiar forgetfulness in Eley&#8217;s story in a
couple of respects. First, he never even mentions Engels and his
Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, a short book
that maintained a fairly constant left readership, and whose pages
both include a striking critical image of the modern working class
family as itself divided between a &#8216;bourgeois&#8217; husband and a
&#8216;proletarian&#8217; wife, and which envisages a future in which sexual
relations will be founded solely on mutual attraction and not
material dependence. Eley does note, though only in passing, that
August Bebel&#8217;s Women and Socialism was a bestseller in the
socialist movement. Second, his implied critique of both Clara Zetkin
and Eleanor Marx quite hides from view that, just as the &#8216;left&#8217;
was a field of contesting voices, so too was &#8216;feminism&#8217;. There
was always a practical and theoretical argument between &#8216;bourgeois
feminism&#8217; and &#8216;socialist feminism&#8217; <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>Eley&#8217;s treatment of the question seems too one-sided. Yet he
himself provides some of the materials to question it. He opens his
discussion of the pre-1914 period with the story of Edith Lanchester,
a Social Democratic Federation (SDF) member from Battersea, who in
1895 announced her intention of living with James Sullivan in a &#8216;free
love&#8217; union. Edith and James were opposed in principle to marriage
as a social institution because it destroyed women&#8217;s independence.
Edith&#8217;s father and brothers intervened, having her hauled off to an
asylum with a certificate of insanity signed by a mental specialist,
Dr George Fielding Blandford. A campaign in her support won a writ of
habeas corpus. Two commissioners in lunacy found Edith to be &#8216;of
sound mind, if misguided&#8217; and eventually ordered her discharge.</p>

<p>The left at the time was divided over the &#8216;Lanchester case&#8217;.
Her own party, the SDF, defended her rights and condemned the
kidnapping, but while nodding to the Marxist critique of marriage it
argued for pragmatic observance of &#8216;the world as it is&#8217; and
disavowed individual &#8216;anarchistic action or personal revolt&#8217;. The
SDF wanted to dissociate itself from &#8216;free love&#8217; doctrines, and
was joined by the Independent Labour Party (ILP), whose leader, Keir
Hardie, also worried about socialism&#8217;s bad name: &#8216;Enemies of
socialism know that such an escapade as that meditated by Miss
Lanchester tends to discredit it among all classes.&#8217; However, there
were other voices, among them dissenting SDF members, who saw Edith
Lanchester&#8217;s stand as a blow against &#8216;this dark age of hypocrisy
and ignorance&#8217;, while Robert Blatchford&#8217;s independent socialist
weekly, The Clarion, declared, &#8216;Socialists believe that a woman has
a perfect right to do what she likes with her own body ... in
defiance of priests, laws, customs and cant&#8217;. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a> Blatchford&#8217;s
view was perhaps more widely shared on the left than Eley will allow.</p>

<p>What more general sense should we make of this story? One obvious
point is that the left was divided in respect of this case, as indeed
it would continue to be over all manner of questions. That suggests
that we need to understand &#8216;the left&#8217;, not as a homogeneous body
of opinion and organisation, but rather as a field of argument.
Within that field, a whole variety of voices appear, some seemingly
echoing half-forgotten voices from the past (and suggesting, by the
way, that earlier utopian ideas about gender were not entirely lost),
others offering ideas and terms that would burst forth again in
different conditions &#8211; how very modern, for example, Blatchford&#8217;s
Clarion sounds! All of this means that the very definition of &#8216;the
left&#8217; presents a practical-theoretical problem, whose contours are
liable to alter in different conditions, and which sets up important
strategic questions for socialists.</p>

<p>In this respect, Eley&#8217;s account is sometimes unsatisfactory. On
the politics of gender, he states, &#8216;The more consistent the
socialism, one might say, the more easily feminist demands were
postponed to the socialist future, because a sternly materialist
standpoint insisted that none of these questions could be tackled
while capitalism perdured&#8217;. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p>This is very questionable. What or who is to count as &#8216;consistent
socialism&#8217;, and what is this &#8216;materialist standpoint&#8217;? As Eley
himself documents in the second part of his book, it was the
Bolsheviks who, in the immediate aftermath of the October Revolution,
carried through legislation embodying the most complete set of
feminist demands available at their time, far in advance of anything
in the rest of the world. But then the Bolsheviks&#8217; version of
&#8216;materialism&#8217; was very different from that which Eley attributes
to the left. Bolshevik politics involved a rediscovery of the
revolutionary ideas of Karl Marx, ideas founded on a version of
materialism that Eley seems not to understand well. The issues are
quite fundamental, for they concern the book&#8217;s central themes:
democracy, socialist transformation, and the nature of the left.</p>

<p>How is democracy, and social transformation generally, to be
achieved? &#8216;In practice,&#8217; writes Eley, &#8216;democratic goals can
only ever be pursued against the resistance of dominant social
groups&#8217;. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> Expanding democracy is not just a matter of goodwill
and understanding, but of struggle against resistance. Here we have
half of a Marxist argument, and an important half. But only half.
Back in 1845&#8211;1846, in <strong>The German Ideology</strong>, Marx and Engels
made a similar point, in support of the necessity of revolution, but
added to it something deeper:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist
consciousness, and for the success of the cause itself, the
alteration of men on a mass scale is necessary, an alteration which
can only take place in a practical movement, a revolution; this
revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling class
cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also because the class
overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of
all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Socialism is not just a matter of overcoming ruling class
resistance. Those who do the overcoming must also transform
themselves in that struggle. That whole argument rests on a
materialist position spelled out by Marx in a brief but critical set
of notes in the spring of 1845. Materialism up till then, he
suggested, treated reality only as an object of contemplation, and
not as &#8216;sensuous human activity, practice, not subjectively&#8217;. It
had been idealist philosophy which had developed &#8211; albeit
abstractly &#8211; &#8217;the active side&#8217;. Against &#8216;old materialism&#8217;
Marx upheld a &#8216;new materialism&#8217; which no longer treated human
beings as the (passive) creatures of their circumstances, but
insisted that they defined themselves through their own activity:
&#8216;The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human
activity or self changing can be conceived and rationally understood
only as revolutionary practice&#8217;. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p>This is a &#8216;sternly materialist standpoint&#8217;, but one leading to
conclusions very different from those Eley attributes to those
(unnamed) socialist thinkers who said women must wait for socialism
to liberate them. Whether the subject be women, or workers, Marx
insists, they can only change their conditions insofar as they
themselves are active and thus transform themselves. It is upon this
foundation that Marx, in the 1860s, wrote the opening words of the
<em>Provisional Rules of the First International</em>: &#8216;The
emancipation of the working classes must be conquered by the working
classes themselves&#8217;. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p>Such ideas will be familiar to many readers of this journal. They
provide the basis for drawing a fundamental distinction within the
ranks of those identifying themselves as &#8216;the left&#8217; over the past
century and a half. The point was made brilliantly by the late Hal
Draper, who distinguished between &#8216;two souls of socialism&#8217; that
he termed &#8216;socialism from above&#8217; and &#8216;socialism from below&#8217;.
<a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a> The essence of &#8216;socialism from above&#8217; is the idea that some
&#8216;saviour from on high&#8217; &#8211; clever intellectuals, a party, an
elected body of parliamentary MPs, etc. &#8211; will carry out the
emancipation of society on its behalf. Such a conception, Marx
suggested in his third <em>Thesis on Feuerbach</em>, underlay all those
varieties of &#8216;materialism&#8217; which declared that men are the
products of their circumstances and upbringing, forgetting that men
change their circumstances and that the educator must himself be
educated. If human beings are determined, rather than self
determining, then changing society must be the activity of a group
superior to society, which itself somehow escapes determination. The
doctrine of &#8216;socialism from above&#8217; is inherently elitist, indeed
reproduces fundamental assumptions of class society. It denies the
crucial role of popular creative development in history; it is,
indeed, in the strictest sense &#8216;counter-revolutionary.&#8217; By
contrast, &#8216;socialism from below&#8217; insists that society&#8217;s
transformation is necessarily the work of the majority, the product
of their own self activity and self organisation. This doctrine is
inherently revolutionary, as well as being inherently democratic. In
general terms, we can view the whole history of socialism as an
ongoing contest between adherents of these two opposed traditions.</p>

<p>That contest is central to the equally long-running argument
between &#8216;reform&#8217; and &#8216;revolution&#8217;. This is not,
unfortunately, how Eley understands that argument. For him, while
democratic goals can only be pursued against the resistance of
dominant social groups, the decisive political and philosophical
question becomes something different: &#8216;How far can attacks on the
legitimacy of private interests stay compatible with the democratic
principle, without requiring the use of force and the damaging of
basic rights, while the new collectivist system is being installed?&#8217;
Divisions over this question, he goes on to suggest, have been &#8216;one
of the main dividing lines between reformist and revolutionary
movements&#8217;. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> This reduces the argument to a debate between
socialism and liberalism about the degree to which private interests
can and should be overcome, and about whether force is a legitimate
means to achieve this. What quite disappears is any conception of
popular self organisation as the critical issue. Nor does any issue
of principle appear to divide those who stand on either side.</p>

<p>Eley presents a Marx who seems something of a caricature. His Marx
in 1848 was &#8216;trapped in Blanquism&#8217;s practical logic&#8217;, despite
his break with the conspiratorial traditions of existing
revolutionary groups:</p>

<p class="quoteb">... moving ahead of popular consciousness, [Marx] still
aimed to steer the masses towards insurrectionary showdown ... Marx
and his friends claimed to know the future by virtue of understanding
history&#8217;s inescapable progress. This put them in a superior
relation to the masses, divining the true direction of their
interests. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In a footnote, he expands on this idea: &#8216;When knowledge of a
future outcome is claimed, a manipulative approach to popular
politics easily follows, in which the masses are moved to the
appropriate destination, whether or not they understand&#8217;. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a> In
this manner, Eley gives flesh to an earlier argument, that the legacy
of Blanquism continued in the shape of vanguardism, which he defines
as &#8216;the idea that minorities of disciplined revolutionaries,
equipped with sophisticated theories and superior virtue, could
anticipate the direction of popular hopes, act decisively in their
name, and in the process radicalise the masses&#8217;. This is the
politics he attributes to Marx &#8211; in flat contradiction to the
historical record.</p>

<p>What did Marx actually argue during and after the 1848
revolutions? Practical experience in 1848 showed, he suggested, that
bourgeois forces rapidly lose their appetite for revolution in the
face of working class revolutionary activity, and come to play a
reactionary role. What is the status of this argument? It is, surely,
that we can learn something about who can and can&#8217;t be expected to
be consistent and trustworthy allies in a revolutionary crisis. It
suggests, moreover, that workers need to understand this reality, so
that they will not be misled by false friends. How is this
&#8216;manipulative&#8217;? Does it involve any element of acting in the
masses&#8217; name under the illusion that such action will radicalise
them? Not at all. What it does involve is openly expressing a
standpoint. Marx and Engels, like their successors, disdained to hide
their views. The test of their ideas would lie, in part, in the
clarity with which they expressed them, the means they developed to
promulgate them, and, above all, the degree to which they were
actually recognised by real workers&#8217; movements as summarising their
actual experience and showing a road forward. There is nothing
Blanquist, or manipulative, in any of this &#8211; unless one supposes,
as Marx decidedly did not, that workers couldn&#8217;t think for themselves.</p>

<p>Eley is not even very consistent in his account of Marx. He notes
in passing that the period after Marx&#8217;s death, when labour
movements bifurcated into &#8216;political&#8217; and &#8216;industrial&#8217; wings,
each pursuing its own reformist ends, undermined Marx&#8217;s vision of a
unified emancipatory struggle and that, in that process, Marx&#8217;s own
commitment to &#8216;direct participatory democracy&#8217; (exemplified in
his comments on the Paris Commune of 1871) was also lost, as the
battle for democracy was, for a period, reduced almost entirely to
parliamentary forms. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> Now, we can either have a Marx whose
thought was hopelessly split between &#8216;Blanquist manipulation&#8217; and
a belief in &#8216;direct participatory democracy&#8217;, as Eley seems to
imply, or we can have a more consistent Marx &#8211; much truer to the
historical record &#8211; who completely rejected Blanquism and all other
forms of &#8216;socialism from above&#8217;, and whose thinking was always
that of a revolutionary and democratic socialism &#8216;from below&#8217;.</p>

<p>What is true is that Marx&#8217;s revolutionary ideas were
significantly changed by the generation of socialist intellectuals
who came to leadership in the social democratic parties after Marx
and Engels quit the scene. In the hands of thinkers like Kautsky and
Hilferding, the revolutionary ideas of Marx were reduced to a
&#8216;scientism&#8217;, in which &#8216;historical laws&#8217; were somehow supposed
to guarantee socialist advance, independently of what actual
historical men and women actually did and thought.</p>

<p>The development of mass social democratic parties, committed to
parliamentary methods and attached to national unions, with their own
bureaucracies, would pose new problems of theory, strategy and
tactics to the left. These developments provided the setting for the
Europe-wide debates, in the two decades before 1914, about
&#8216;revisionism&#8217; and &#8216;economism&#8217; &#8211; the first form in which
divisions between &#8216;left&#8217; and &#8216;right&#8217; manifested themselves
with some degree of clarity. What gradually became apparent was that
the very institutions and practices of European labour movements were
becoming, even as they were being created and developed, not only
means but also impediments to democratic and socialist advance. This
growing awareness is signalled, for example, in Rosa Luxemburg&#8217;s
writings. In 1899, sharply rebutting Eduard Bernstein in her <strong>Social
Reform and Revolution</strong>, she attributed the influence of
&#8216;revisionism&#8217; to the continuing weight of the &#8216;petty
bourgeoisie&#8217; within social democracy. Seven years later, when she
wrote <strong>The Mass Strike</strong>, her whole emphasis had shifted: now she
saw the very structures of existing social democracy in Germany, with
its divisions into parliamentarist and trade union wings, as itself
the source of the problem. Now it appeared that the barriers the
working class must surmount if it was to overthrow capitalism
included not only the combined forces of capital and the state, but
also the very organisations it had itself created in pursuit of its
aims. Now the left must also take account of the conservatism of the
party and trade union bureaucracies, and their readiness to hold back
working class insurgency.</p>

<p>That discovery &#8211; variously nuanced in the different countries
where industrial capitalism was most developed &#8211; necessarily had
momentous consequences for socialist theory, for strategy and
tactics. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a> How, in the first place, should the emergence of these
&#8216;revisionist&#8217; tendencies be explained &#8211; as the product of a
thin layer of relatively privileged officials and &#8216;labour
aristocrats&#8217;, or as the outcome of deeper contradictory processes
of working class incorporation within the routines of modern
capitalism? Second, how far would their conservative impulses carry
the leaders of the parties and the unions towards accommodation with
the ruling order? Would they merely seek to blur the contradictions
between capital and labour, or actually change sides? Third, what
kinds of activity did these new realities imply for those who held
fast to the idea of working class self emancipation? How far and in
what form should the left break organisationally with organised
reformist bodies? Was it sufficient to debate fundamental questions 
within the framework of existing organisations? Should socialists
rely on the emergence of spontaneous rank and file opposition to
union and party bureaucracies? Should they organise entirely
separately and in complete isolation from the reformist bodies,
whether in new specifically revolutionary parties or in newly founded
militant unions? How should revolutionaries relate to the large
masses of workers who remained under the sway of the conservative
bureaucracies within the official labour movements? Here was a mass
of complex questions, whose solution would require both a rediscovery
and remaking of Marxism&#8217;s core meaning in the light of new
conditions, as well as the practical testing of different solutions.</p>

<p>Nor did these problems arise in isolation. By the start of the
20th century the European powers had largely divided the globe
between them in a set of competing empires and spheres of influence.
Great Power rivalries were building up, military budgets were rising,
nationalist sentiments were being promoted (along with support for
anti-foreigner feeling and racism towards colonial subjects), and
questions about the rights of the nations in Europe&#8217;s ramshackle
absolutist empires were being posed with growing sharpness. Across
most of Europe, there were still millions of small farmers whose
political allegiances were in doubt: what policy should working class
parties adopt to them and their concerns &#8211; or should they
effectively ignore them and focus only on farm labourers on big
estates, as Kautsky urged?</p>

<p>Solutions to these and other dilemmas were not quickly and
immediately available. It would take the immense crisis produced by
the First World War and its aftermath for anything like clear answers
to emerge.</p>

<p>Geoff Eley is a good historian, in the sense that he does report
the various issues and debates, often with a wealth of fascinating
detail. He recognises the emerging conflict within unions between the
growing bureaucracies and &#8216;the elemental democracies of the shop
floor&#8217;. He records how the SPD and other social democratic parties
hankered after bourgeois respectability, the parliamentarist nature
of the parties, their disinterest in (indeed in Kautsky&#8217;s case,
their direct opposition to) aspirations to workers&#8217; control in
industry, their inattention to colonialism and to feminist issues,
and so on. But he reaches a limit. At no point does he &#8216;take
sides&#8217;, in the sense of arguing where the logic of any position
might lead, even though he clearly feels that many of these positions
were mistaken or problematical. Nor, therefore, does he press hard at
that difficult but vital question, who or what is to count as &#8216;the
left&#8217;? Was &#8216;the left&#8217; a potentially united entity, or did deep
inherent divisions mean that its major wings were bound to come into
sharp conflict? Such questions haunt the rest of his story.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>1914&#8211;1923</h4>

<p class="fst">The ten years from 1914 to 1923 represented a critical period in
the development of the left in Europe, and indeed across the world.
The unprecedented mass killing and deprivations of the First World
War occasioned an immense wave of popular radicalisation. Already
developing contradictions in emerging labour organisations came to a
head. Working class and socialist organisations were riven with
bitter conflicts and splits: between union and party bureaucracies on
one hand and the aspirations and demands of rank and file workers on
the other; between the defenders of parliamentarism and moderation
and newly self conscious proponents of revolutionary politics;
between different conceptions of the nature of socialism and equally
of Marxism. New, if temporary, alliances were formed, for example
between revolutionary Marxists and anarcho-syndicalists.</p>

<p>This period threw up fundamental problems which would continue to
be central to socialist argument for the next 80 years. Because they
were not resolved adequately &#8211; ie practically &#8211; the appalling
slaughter of the First World War was followed only two decades later
by six more years of even more terrible death and destruction, in
what Eric Hobsbawm dubbed the Thirty Years War of the 20th century.</p>

<p>Before 1914, famously, the Second International passed apparently
united resolutions declaring its militant opposition to impending
war. In August 1914, however, all but the Russian and Bulgarian
socialist parties fell in behind their respective national
governments, contributing to the pro-war hysteria that marked its
outbreak. In country after country the socialist opponents of
imperialist war found themselves in isolated minorities. As Eley
records, for right wing socialist party leaders and union
bureaucrats, the war brought a kind of &#8216;socialism&#8217;: they were
courted and integrated into government, in return for their
abandoning the practice of class opposition. It meant, for the
working class, as well as mass conscription and rising death rates at
the front, speed-up in the factories, the suspension of factory
regulations, lower safety standards, the freezing of basic union
rights and falling living standards: &#8216;Thus the socialists&#8217;
integration into government was matched by rank and file alienation&#8217;. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p>Given the disorientation imposed by official social democracy, the
speed and degree with which organised popular discontent manifested
itself was impressive. Strikes &#8211; at first over &#8216;economic&#8217; and
soon over &#8216;political&#8217; issues &#8211; became ever more frequent as the
war progressed. Militant workers created new organisational forms
like the Internal Commissions in Italy or the Clyde Workers&#8217;
Committee and shop stewards movement in Britain. The stage was set
for deep splits and regroupments in existing left organisations.
Internationally, the left managed to organise two small anti-war
conferences in Switzerland. In Germany the SPD expelled its left wing
in 1917, producing a new Independent Party, the USPD. However, as
Eley notes, the new party &#8216;lacked either a coherent vision or a
solid popular organisation&#8217;. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a> The same was true of other broad
left oppositions such as developed in France, in the Italian
&#8216;Maximalists&#8217; or the Leeds anti-war convention in Britain. The
strongest expression of militancy, economic or political, came at
rank and file level.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the war and after, the old European order
was to be shaken to its core by popular militancy. The critical
question became: what will follow? Who will master the popular
explosions, and where will Europe (and the world) go? No serious
practical answer could be given to that unless, simultaneously, the
question of defining &#8216;the left&#8217; was also posed clearly. If the
1914&#8211;1918 war had already brought that issue sharply to the fore, the
revolutionary wave from 1917 made it still more urgent.</p>

<p>The same essential elements that would soon convulse the whole of
Europe were, as Eley remarks, central to the first revolution, in
Russia in February 1917. That revolution drew on the militancy of
women from the textile mills and the bread lines, a huge wave of
strikes and the mutinying of troops. In the very process of the
uprising, workers and soldiers recreated the institutions they had
first invented in 1905, the soviets (popular councils). February thus
produced a situation in Russia of &#8216;dual power&#8217; in which rival
institutions &#8211; on one side a provisional government, on the other
the soviet &#8211; contested for practical power. However, those who
initially came to head the soviet were the &#8216;moderate left&#8217; who
fell back into the position of the social democratic right across
Europe: they resisted popular demands for change and reform, defended
the polices of the Provisional Government, and continued to support
the war. The Menshevik view, summed up by the German socialist Karl
Kautsky as &#8216;masterly limitation&#8217;, was, Eley suggests, &#8216;principled
and realistic as an assessment of Russia&#8217;s existing developmental
resources&#8217;. However, as he goes on to point out, &#8216;this strategy
remained doctrinaire, abysmally unsuited for the popular mobilisation
of 1917 ... Mensheviks found themselves constantly trying to hold
popular hopes back, within the bourgeois revolution&#8217;s normative
limits ... [Their policy] trapped the Mensheviks into a debilitating
logic of incorporation ... They continued substituting for the social
force &#8211; the liberal bourgeoisie &#8211; they believed the rightful
bearer of the revolution&#8217;. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> Time and again both the Mensheviks
and the Social Revolutionaries resisted popular demands for an end to
the war, for a solution to peasant land hunger and a resolution of
the social struggle over wages, prices and the control of industry &#8211;
demands emerging from a still radicalising population.</p>

<p>Such inner conflicts &#8211; between newly promoted governments and
radical popular movements, where proponents of so called &#8216;moderate&#8217;
policies sought to demobilise the very forces that had propelled them
into office &#8211; would characterise every significant subsequent
revolution. Time and again such conflicts would derail those
revolutions. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>What made the Russian Revolution unusual was the presence of
Lenin&#8217;s Bolshevik Party. During 1917 &#8216;pressure for resolving dual
power in favour of the soviet reached a crescendo&#8217; &#8211; and only the
Bolsheviks consistently urged that resolution. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a> Eley sums the
matter up well: &#8216;Bolshevism rose to power by organising this
popular radicalisation&#8217;. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a> As he also shows, Bolshevism in
reality was far from the widespread caricature of a disciplined
vanguard party. Additionally, only Lenin&#8217;s Bolsheviks had a
practical pro-peasant policy: &#8216;The worst failure of the
non-Bolshevik left&#8217; (the Mensheviks and SRs) was their refusal to
back peasant demands, and actions, for immediate land reform. In
1917, the Bolsheviks &#8216;alone took the peasants seriously&#8217;. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a></p>

<p>Eley&#8217;s account of 1917 in Russia is refreshing after the
mountains of reactionary nonsense so many historians have served up.
Unlike other historians, he gives proper weight to the
internationalist perspective that underlay the theory of &#8216;permanent
revolution&#8217;. I would only question his account in two respects.
First, he doesn&#8217;t discuss what might have happened had the
Menshevik policy succeeded. Had power not passed to the soviets, the
revolution&#8217;s popular base in the working class, the army and the
countryside would have been demobilised. Menshevik success would have
opened space for the victory, not of liberal moderation, but of the
far right, represented by both the military high command (in a more
successful re-run of the Kornilov coup attempt) and the Russian
employers. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a> The war, with its immense loss of life, would have
dragged on; fierce and bloody repression of workers, peasants and
mutinous soldiers would have been instituted. &#8216;Dual power&#8217; could
not last: resolving it against the soviet would have stripped the
popular revolution of its gains. Second, while Eley finds Lenin&#8217;s
&#8216;powerful unity of conviction and action&#8217; admirable, he finds
&#8216;less appealing&#8217; Lenin&#8217;s &#8216;belief in splitting &#8211; his drive
for polemical clarification, brutally distancing his rivals&#8217;. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a>
But a &#8216;nicer&#8217; Lenin would have compromised with the Mensheviks,
not challenged the Second International&#8217;s betrayals, and let the
revolution go hang. It was precisely the sharpness of Lenin&#8217;s
political intellect, his willingness to follow a correct idea to its
conclusions, indeed a readiness to split when necessary, that made
him effective. Eley&#8217;s term &#8216;rivals&#8217; diminishes the problem, as
if the matter were one of competition among potential partners. Those
whom Lenin &#8216;distanced&#8217; were political opponents, whether parties
or individuals, whose influence would, if unchallenged, have the
effect of undermining or reversing the revolutionary struggle.</p>

<p>After the Russian Revolution, the question posed was, as Eley
rightly asks, was there a possibility that revolutionary socialism
could also triumph elsewhere in Europe? Here Eley expresses doubts:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Russian extremes created chances for the left that
weren&#8217;t available elsewhere in Europe. Some wartime circumstances
were generic &#8211; notably, the labour movement&#8217;s incorporation via
patriotism, bringing gains for leaders but hardship for the rank and
file. But in other ways, Russian circumstances were least like the
others, because the thinness of civil society left Russia
exceptionally vulnerable to generalised breakdown, which the West&#8217;s
more developed institutional resources forestalled. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The theme is &#8216;Gramscian&#8217;, with a Eurocommunist inflexion. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a>
But the analysis is weak. In what exactly did the &#8216;thinness of
civil society&#8217; in Russia consist, by comparison with Western
Europe, and especially as far as strategy was concerned? The crucial
&#8216;more developed institutional resources&#8217; in the West were those
of organised reformism, notably as they were embodied in the social
democratic parties and union bureaucracies. There is no question that
overcoming their conservatism would be a central strategic question
for revolutionary socialists, but a question that required, let us
emphasise, an answer cast in terms of politics and not of
sociological determinism.</p>

<p>Eley&#8217;s account seems muddled. He notes how the Russian
Revolution caught the imagination of socialists across Europe,
cracking apart Kautsky&#8217;s and Hilferding&#8217;s tired old version of
Marxism as a theory of historical inevitability. Now human creative
agency could again be given its proper, central place. But Eley
argues that the revolutionary politics of the new generation suffered
in two respects. On one hand, &#8216;post-revolutionary constitutions
were still conceived in parliamentary terms,&#8217; while on the other,
&#8216;the new revolutionaries neglected building the coalitions so
crucial to the practical survival of revolutionary regimes, given the
social, religious and ethnic heterogeneity of all European
countries.&#8217; The first criticism ignores the way the socialist
movement divided sharply over whether &#8216;post-revolutionary
constitutions&#8217; should be conceived in parliamentary terms, and thus
how these divisions set up new strategic and tactical questions. As
for the second, the issue of coalitions was certainly crucial.
However, it was not merely about the survival of revolutionary
regimes, but about whether revolution ought to happen at all.
Furthermore, the problem of &#8216;coalitions&#8217; was not just about
sociological heterogeneity within Europe, but above all concerned the
question of how to respond to the existence of varied political
currents within the working class itself.</p>

<p>What is striking about the years 1918&#8211;1923 is the combination of
immensely powerful popular revolutionary impulses with an absence of
strategic clarity among the newly emerging revolutionary socialist
parties and groups. Eley catches something of this with the remark
that (in Germany) &#8216;during 1919&#8211;1921, the passions and hopes of
rank and file insurgents constantly outstripped the capacity of
existing left organisations to represent them&#8217; <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a>, a judgment
which could be extended well beyond Germany. If one thing tended to
unite the emerging revolutionary left, it was a rejection of
parliamentarism and an aspiration to a form of society based on
workers&#8217; councils, an impulse that took on different organisational
forms and names in different countries. However, the realisation of
such visions necessarily required a strategic capacity that was
mostly wanting. For &#8216;council communism&#8217;, Eley&#8217;s term for these
impulses, brought the movement into direct conflict with trade union
officialdom and with the leadership of the social democratic parties.
In order to win out, its supporters must necessarily face up to a
range of practical as well as theoretical issues. Eley mentions some
of these &#8211; although his list is curiously ordered:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There were huge areas council communists ignored.
Questions of women, the family, and the sexual division of labour
were one. Coalition building was another, for the council movement
refused to worry about peasants, petty bourgeoisie and other
non-proletarian social groups. Council militants were untroubled by
the administrative consequences of organising revolutionary
government around the point of production. If the councils had a
factory rather than a territorial basis, training workers for running
production rather than society in general, then how would the
non-economic functions of government be addressed? How would the
councils deal with social welfare and education? How successfully
could they represent the interests of non-workers? <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Yet if these weaknesses were real &#8211; and they were &#8211; even more
central was the question, how are the defenders of such revolutionary
programmes to win over real, practical majorities, given the still
predominant influence of social democracy and its associated union
bureaucracies within popular movements? Council communism&#8217;s
opponents were not simply the capitalist classes and the state
machineries, but the forces of &#8216;moderation&#8217; inside the labour
movements of Europe. &#8216;The left&#8217; was now not just openly divided &#8211;
it was facing in opposite directions.</p>

<p>Nowhere was this more apparent than in Germany. November 1918 saw
the Kaiser&#8217;s regime fall, in a rerun &#8211; on a still more massive
scale &#8211; of February 1917 in Russia. Also as in Russia, an immediate
division appeared between &#8216;moderates&#8217; and &#8216;militants.&#8217; The
SPD, which had supported the war until the end, was suddenly thrust
into government, alongside a left whose forces lacked anything like
the ideological clarity the Bolsheviks had possessed and won in
Russia. Eley comments on the SPD, &#8216;The most striking thing about
the German revolution was the unrelenting intransigence of the SPD&#8217;s
moderation. Rather than harnessing working class militancy, the
leaders did their best to suppress it&#8217;. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a> Even the term
&#8216;moderation&#8217; is understated: the SPD leaders allied themselves
with the former Kaiser&#8217;s army high command, and deliberately
assisted in the creation of the Freikorps, a right wing military
formation established to destroy working class militancy. While the
SPD were hard-headed and determined, the USPD offered no convincing
alternative, despite attracting large new forces, while the newly
formed Spartacists and the rest of the far left were fragmented and
inexperienced. Indeed, within weeks of their founding conference, the
Spartacists allowed themselves to be drawn into a minority effort at
socialist revolution, the Spartacist uprising of January 1919, which
was put down with ferocity. Among those deliberately killed were the
new party&#8217;s leaders, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. Urged on
by the SPD leaders, the Freikorps marched about Germany crushing
working class resistance with murderous force.</p>

<p>In Eley&#8217;s account, the emergent workers&#8217; councils in Germany
represented the possibility of a &#8216;third way&#8217; between the SPD&#8217;s
constitutionalism and the insurrectionary politics of the left,
inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a> For Eley, the tragedy is
that the SPD failed to offer any support to such a &#8216;third way&#8217;.
He finds Ebert and the other SPD leaders &#8216;lamentably unimaginative
in failing to harness this popular upsurge ... [The SPD&#8217;s]
constitutionalist course was imposed at a double cost: the bases of
authoritarianism in the state and economy had been saved, indeed
renewed, in their time of greatest vulnerability; and the best
expressions of popular democracy had been rebuffed, even brutally
repressed&#8217;. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a> He continues:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The real tragedy of 1918&#8211;1919 was not the failure to
force through a socialist revolution. The abstract merits of such a
course may be endlessly debated, but it could only have succeeded
through a long and bloody civil war, and for many socialists this was
too high a price to pay. The real tragedy was the SPD&#8217;s excessively
legalistic, stolidly unimaginative, and wholly conservative notion of
what a democratically ordered polity might be. In 1918, the SPD had
an unprecedented chance to expand the frontiers of democracy, both by
dismantling the bases of authoritarianism in the discredited <em>ancien
r&#233;gime</em> and by harnessing the new popular energies the council
movement released. The chances of a further-reaching reformism were
squandered. It was by its own democratic lights that the SPD failed
the test. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Here his judgment seems to me to be seriously at fault. It is not
that socialist revolution could be on the immediate agenda in 1918 or
early 1919. That would require the left winning a majority among
German workers and others in support of such a project. &#8216;Civil war&#8217;
was, in any case, unavoidable: it is exactly what occurred in
Germany, on and off, from 1919 to 1923. The real problem with Eley is
that he thinks it appropriate to chide the SPD leaders for their
policies and lack of imagination, as if they could in any sense still
be counted as part of the left. It was the achievement of the
Zimmerwald left during the war to realise that the SPD and the other
parties of the Second International had already not only declared
their bankruptcy as agencies of socialist change, but become part of
the problem rather than of the solution. The fact that the SPD still
gained the largest slice of the working class vote was,
strategically, of no more significance than the adhesion of many
workers in Britain to the Tory and Liberal parties. The real tragedy
in Germany was the left&#8217;s failure to find a way to challenge and
transcend the SPD&#8217;s hold over workers&#8217; political loyalties, a
hold that was &#8211; as Eley notes &#8211; never a given. Separate communist
organisation did not even appear until after the November Revolution.
The Spartacists, and subsequently the KPD, were marked by lack of
clarity about how to respond to the explosion of popular movements,
and subsequently veered between ultra-leftism and rightist
accommodation in ways that cost the German left dearly &#8211; and, in
costing them dearly, it would cost a lot more, not just for German
working people but for the whole world. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a></p>

<p>The struggle to gain such clarity was hard. An entire theoretical
and organisational heritage had to be critically explored and remade,
often in the heat of difficult new developments. Nor was the problem
in any sense confined to Germany. In Italy, for example, the central
source of confusion lay in the PSI (the Socialist Party of Italy),
whose leader, Serrati, was responsible for the infamous statement,
&#8216;We, as Marxists, interpret history; we do not make it.&#8217; Eley comments:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Maximalist failings were an object lesson in how not to
conduct a revolution. They fed expectations without resolving them.
They fanned a mood of revolutionary excitement but refused to shape
it into a revolutionary challenge. They fashioned socialism into a
barrier against the bourgeois world and from behind this ideological
stockade released a fusillade of rhetorical provocation. But when the
masses took them at their word and acted, they counselled discipline
and patience. <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p class="fst">He goes on to add, rather confusingly for those who have just read
him on Germany, that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">One lesson of Maximalist failings, then, was
organisational: the need for revolutionary leadership, a Bolshevik
party. This was Bordiga&#8217;s position, and during 1920 Gramsci joined
him ... Italian socialism encapsulated the left&#8217;s dilemma in the
post-war revolutionary conjuncture. The obstacles to socialist
revolution, in Italy no less than Germany, were formidable. But among
them was a failure of revolutionary leadership, which &#8216;faded away
at the moment of truth&#8217;. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It might seem, then, that Eley agrees that the problem in Germany
too was the failure of revolutionary leadership. And might we then
expect some discussion of the specific failures of both the German
and Italian communists, and of what a &#8216;Bolshevik leadership&#8217;
ought actually to have done in the midst of the crises that convulsed
these countries?</p>

<p>Not at all. Eley&#8217;s real agenda is different. He is interested in
asking how the &#8216;transition to a new social democratic era&#8217; might
have been achieved, even if that might then become the prelude to &#8216;a
restabilisation of capitalism&#8217;. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a> After their electoral
successes in November 1919, and again at the height of the factory
occupations in September 1920, Eley thinks the PSI&#8217;s best hope was
to join and help shape &#8216;a broader democratic bloc&#8217;. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a></p>

<p>In both Germany and Italy, Eley looks for what never had a basis:
&#8216;A successful non-Bolshevik left needed the best of both worlds:
radical yet democratic extraparliamentary energies mobilised and
channelled through the parliamentary process&#8217;. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a> There is no
sense of the process, repeated time and again in potentially
revolutionary situations in the course of the 20th century, whereby
just such &#8216;channelling through the parliamentary process&#8217; is the
very means by which extraparliamentary popular energies have been
regularly demobilised. Nor is any concrete analysis offered of the
emerging shapes of the actual &#8216;radical and extraparliamentary
energies&#8217; that most certainly did develop.</p>

<p>Within a remarkably short space of time after the 1920 factory
occupations, Mussolini&#8217;s fascists had taken power. It was a
stunning defeat for the left, and indeed for democracy in any sense.
<a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a> But, extraordinarily, Eley has nothing to say about it, about
how it happened, whether it was preventable, and what it can tell us
about the left&#8217;s failings. The lapse in his narrative is
astonishing &#8211; and he is, as we&#8217;ll see, to repeat it on an even
more serious scale in his next section.</p>

<p>Part of the difficulty with Eley&#8217;s account of the whole period
consists in an apparent failure to understand what, in shorthand, we
might term &#8216;Leninism&#8217;. While he gives a generally good account of
the Russian Revolution itself, his sense of the logic of Lenin&#8217;s
politics is deficient. He writes that, once insurrection in Europe
was no longer on the agenda, &#8216;Lenin would find himself,
willy-nilly, conceding the importance of parliamentary, trade union
and other &#8220;legal&#8221; fields of action, however tactical,
subordinate, or cynical these concessions claimed to be&#8217;. <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a>
Lenin&#8217;s whole political career before 1917 is thus dismissed: his
arguments for and involvement in factory and union agitation, the
Bolsheviks&#8217; work in the Duma, their activity in &#8216;sickness funds&#8217;
and so on. <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a> Eley makes nothing of Lenin&#8217;s reproof to European
&#8216;left&#8217; communists in <strong>Left Wing Communism: An Infantile
Disorder</strong>. And he makes nothing, either, of the whole debate
within the new Communist International about the importance of
&#8216;united fronts&#8217;. He does note that the new Communist Parties
faced national &#8216;lefts&#8217; that included a whole gamut of positions
from left reformists to ultra-lefts, identifying this as their
&#8216;thorniest dilemma: how successfully they shaped such militancy
would decisively influence the kind of Communist parties they would
become&#8217;. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a> But what the parameters of debate among them were,
and which were the better and the worse responses, he doesn&#8217;t say.
Nor, therefore, does Eley generally explain why various revolutionary
attempts in this period were defeated. Were they simply inappropriate
leftist adventures, were they overcome by the &#8216;thickness&#8217; of
civil society&#8217;s institutions in West European countries, or did
serious failings in communist strategy and tactics play any
significant role? Eley is generally not very interested in the
revolutionary left, especially as far as its actual politics are
concerned, and thus there are no direct answers to such questions in
his book. Sometimes, as in his brief remarks on the failed Hungarian
soviet revolution of 1919, it seems as if these things just happened
&#8211; rather like his treatment of Mussolini&#8217;s victory in Italy.</p>

<p>In part because he treats these matters as relatively unimportant,
Eley&#8217;s judgment on the political outcome of the period has two
faces. On one side, he sees the split within international socialism
&#8211; most obviously represented by the sharp division between social
democrat and communist, between the Second and Third Internationals &#8211;
as &#8216;disfiguring the left&#8217;s politics until the flux of 1956&#8211;1968
and beyond&#8217;. <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a> On the other, he sees the years of war and
revolution as bringing real gains for democracy and for the left:
1918 brought them to the brink of governing for the first time; they
benefited from universal suffrage, emerging social rights, a large
increment of reform. Those gains were sustained by extraparliamentary
social movements, ranging from the huge growth in trade unions to
women&#8217;s movements of various kinds along with a wide array of
single-issue campaigns, many of them locally based. &#8216;Indeed, the
failures of central European socialists to break through to socialism
during the revolutions of 1918&#8211;1919 mattered far less than the new
democratic capacities and legal resources that the improved
constitutional frameworks now supplied&#8217;. <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a></p>

<p>Was the split in the left at the time disfiguring, or necessary?
What could a &#8216;unity&#8217; resting on the suppression of profound
differences have achieved? How could the followers of the murdered
Rosa Luxemburg sit in the same organisation with those who organised
her killing? What really &#8216;disfigured&#8217; the politics of the left
was not the split, but the trajectories of the two sides thereafter.
As for the social and political gains of the period, it seems
reasonable to ask how securely founded they were. In this respect,
the debacles in Italy and Hungary were as much indicators of crises
that would, all too soon, convulse democracy and the left alike.</p>
<p>There are fundamental issues here. To approach them, we must step
back from Eley&#8217;s text, to explore the rational core of the
&#8216;Leninism&#8217; that Eley opposes and misunderstands, indeed to argue,
in Luk&#225;cs&#8217;s words, that &#8216;the organisation and tactics of
Bolshevism are the only possible consequence of Marxism&#8217;. <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a></p>

<p>Marxism&#8217;s political project is the self emancipation of the
working class, as the key to the emancipation of humanity. That
requires the self constitution of the working class as a collective
subject aiming to abolish its own condition of wage slavery. This is,
it must be stressed, a political project, and not some inevitable
outcome inscribed in imagined laws of history. &#8216;Barbarism&#8217; &#8211;
its potential shapes in advanced capitalism including fascism,
nuclear warfare and ecological degradation &#8211; always remains as an
alternative. History always poses choices.</p>

<p>The key to the Marxist revolutionary project is working class
agency, consciousness and organisation. Its crucial opponent is
ruling class ideology, itself arising not simply from the obvious
effects of capitalist media and the like, but also from the everyday
workings of capitalist economy and politics. Working people, divided
among themselves in manifold ways by competition, come to see their
alienated existence within capitalist social relations as &#8216;natural&#8217;,
even if they contest aspects of this alienation. Popular
consciousness, in Gramsci&#8217;s phrase, is inherently &#8216;contradictory&#8217;,
containing in spontaneous combination elements of the most advanced
and backward thought and activity. Yet it is this working class, with
its actual contradictory tendencies of self development, which
Marxism envisions as the salvation of humanity.</p>

<p>The realities of life within the exploitative and oppressive
social relations of capitalist society constantly regenerate forms of
opposition to the <em>status quo</em>. That opposition takes practical
appearance in an enormous variety of shapes, in a multiform array of
&#8216;social movements&#8217;. Never and nowhere are such movements,
especially as they take on mass form, composed either of members only
of a single class, or of all the members of any one class. Rather,
constructed out of diverse social networks, they typically contain
within themselves a wide spectrum of opinions, aspirations and
prejudices. Just as the working class as a political actor is
anything but homogeneous in its outlook, so it is with the movements
in which it (variably) participates. &#8216;Consciousness&#8217; &#8211;
theoretical and practical alike &#8211; develops unevenly, at different
speeds and degrees and in divergent directions.</p>

<p>Movements are themselves networks of social relations and activity
marked by inner contestation and practical argument. They are not
characterised by unified and coherent ideologies. Furthermore, they
are anything but immune to influence by their opponents, or by ruling
class ideas. What the debates within movements concern is not just
general ideas, or goals, but also the very meaning and nature of the
movements themselves, the kinds of practical methods it is
appropriate for them to employ, the ways they ought to organise
themselves, particular strategies and tactics and so forth. Movement
opponents &#8211; notably employers and states &#8211; have a decided
interest in these various debates. Where, as in liberal democracies,
they have learned that they cannot easily exist without
movement-based oppositions, they have definite interests in shaping
the forms such movements take.</p>

<p>What they prefer are movements without teeth, led by &#8216;responsible&#8217;
people who use their leadership positions to contain supporters
within the &#8216;normal channels&#8217; of legality and constitutional
respectability, and to oppose and demobilise more radical currents.
They want unions that do not step beyond wage demands to challenge
&#8216;managerial prerogatives&#8217;, just as in the 19th century they
wanted even Friendly Societies to remain within the bounds of decency
and good order. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a> And ruling classes have various factors working
for them in their search for self limiting movements: not only the
everyday effects of the very workings of capitalism itself, in which
the wages system and employer authority come to seem &#8216;natural&#8217;,
but also the mechanisms of law, media influence, and even the
material and symbolic rewards offered to co-optable and
&#8216;statesmanlike&#8217; leaders.</p>

<p>However, contrary to those theories of ideology which see nothing
but ruling class domination, the actual experiences of exploitation
and oppression within capitalist society produce countervailing
pressures. There are dual tendencies, both to the containment and to
the regeneration of opposition. As a result, the interior life of
movements consists of permanent contestation of ideas &#8211; permanent
ideological struggle, not least &#8216;over the terms in which the actors
in the class struggle are to construe their experience of it&#8217;. The
very institutions and practices of movements are generated in a
history of victories, defeats and compromises which mark working
class experience, and through which both ruling class ideology and
popular experience come in part to constitute each other mutually.
<a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a> Marxists are numbered among the participants in the arguments
within and about what movements are, can be, and should do and say.</p>

<p>These struggles have to be grasped theoretically, not just in
abstract and general terms, but in relation to a succession of
concrete and particular situations, which are always changing. A
Marxism, on the one hand, which does not deal with the concrete and
immediate is condemned to practical irrelevance, to mere academicism.
On the other hand, a set of oppositional ideas that does not
constantly seek to tease out the dialectical interrelations between
concrete and abstract, between the particular moment and the
totality, is open to &#8216;economism&#8217; and other forms of partial
critique. Thus, for example, it can ignore the varieties of forms of
oppression (and resistance to oppression) that constitute the whole
concrete situation. Each specific situation poses strategic and
tactical issues for all sides, in which the various forces at play
may learn, devise new stratagems, respond and invent. Movement
opponents may put forward new means by which they may seek to confine
or disrupt movement activity, in ways whose implications are not
always easily decoded. Movements in this sense are always, in
Shandro&#8217;s term, &#8216;in the strategic sights&#8217; of their adversaries,
compelling ideological struggle within movements over the
interpretation of events along with the meanings and purposes of
opponents&#8217; actions and words. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a> Such conflicts concern battles
not just over matters of &#8216;distribution&#8217; or &#8216;rights&#8217;, but over
movements&#8217; very self constitution, organisation and self understanding.</p>

<p>Each situation thus constitutes a significant event, whose outcome
will have consequences for future struggles. Every separate event is
always relatively &#8216;open&#8217;, its outcome depending on who does and
says what. All large and small events in the class struggle have
&#8216;turning points&#8217;, moments when the practical and ideological
stances adopted by the various parties and the actions they undertake
set the stage for what is possible next. If this is most obvious in
the case of &#8216;revolutionary situations&#8217;, the principle is by no
means restricted to these. Events involve narratives of struggle,
involving consciousness, organisation and the reformulation of ideas
in the light of experience. Marxists, to be effective, have to be
able to respond creatively to the concrete developments occurring
within each particular situation.</p>

<p>In all of this, the revolutionary socialist standpoint remains
that outlined in the Communist Manifesto: stressing the basic
incompatibility of interests that lies at the heart of capitalism,
advancing arguments for the maximum unity of the movement, always
holding to the overall socialist goal of working class power. What is
quite alien to this is the kind of narrow &#8216;classism&#8217; that Eley
imputes to the left, in which the focus necessarily falls on
apparently immediate working class interests. Here one of Lenin&#8217;s
central arguments in his much-maligned early pamphlet <strong>What Is To
Be Done?</strong> is vital: socialists have to advance the interests of
all the oppressed, acting always as &#8216;tribunes of the people&#8217;.
Working class power as a goal requires that Marxists struggle to
advance the interests of all those who are oppressed in different
ways within class society, and must fight for those interests within
working class movements themselves. Marxism, in other words, always
involves a critical stance towards the very working class movements
that it seeks to influence and advance. <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a> The vital interest of
the working class is to constitute itself as the hegemonic force
within all movements, whether against national, gender, racist or any
other form of oppression, since the alternative is always its own
division, its own narrowness of outlook and aspiration &#8211; and thus
its own containment within capitalist limits.</p>

<p>In this light, Marxism must be a developing rather than a fixed
and finished theory, advancing itself through continual interrogation
of movement practice and ideas, and in a permanent dialogue between
Marxist organisations and the movements in which they participate and
intervene. Its proponents cannot simply be &#8216;educators&#8217;, for they
have to be constantly open to learning. The impulses to Marxism&#8217;s
own creative development often come, not from &#8216;within&#8217; organised
Marxist parties and groups, but from &#8216;without&#8217;, from the
inventive practice of movements themselves. <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a> Indeed, one
important criterion by which to judge Marxists themselves consists in
their capacity to listen and learn as well as to speak and to teach,
to develop their own theory in the light of others&#8217; creative
responses. All of this assumes the position we suggested earlier:
that workers are themselves active, both theoretically and
practically, as subjects of history.</p>

<p>At the same time, Marxism must involve the kind of ruthless
realism that Eley seems to find objectionable in Lenin. If the ruling
class has an interest in shaping the inner world of movement
organisation, ideas and activity, then at any time the movement as a
whole may include forces whose practice and ideas work to mediate
ruling class ideas within the movement. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a> The implication of that
should be very clear: one part of the movement is a problem for the
left, and needs to be opposed effectively. Thus issues of strategy
and tactics concern the interior life of movements. It is necessary
to differentiate within &#8216;the left&#8217; between left and right, with
the right understood as systematically opposed to working class
revolution, i.e. in the strict sense counter-revolutionary. At best,
the right within the movement is always an unreliable ally, and may
come to adopt completely the standpoint of capital and the state.</p>

<p>That was a key lesson Marx derived from the experience of the 1848
revolutions. Later Marxists would further elaborate the practical
implications. The left must establish its own organisational and
ideological identity, separate from and opposed to the &#8216;moderate&#8217;
wing within movements. It needs to do this so that, at any juncture,
it has the capacity to clarify the critical questions facing the
movement, and to argue from within for the adoption of its own
strategy and tactics, as against those whose alternative leadership
would mislead it. The left must stand ready, always, to take sides in
intra-movement disputes and debates, and make continuous
reassessments of successive situations in terms of their particular
limits and potentialities.</p>

<p>A Marxist politics understood in these terms is not &#8216;revolutionism
at any price&#8217;. It demands careful assessment of the balance of
forces at any given moment both within and between movements and
their class opponents. It demands the kind of practical judgment
displayed, for example, by the Bolsheviks in the &#8216;July Days&#8217; in
Petrograd when, faced with a vast armed demonstration of sailors,
soldiers and workers, they were able to say &#8216;Not yet&#8217; to
insurrectionary calls &#8211; on the grounds that a majority of workers,
let alone others, were not yet convinced of the necessity of a second
revolution. That same capacity to judge the situation and act
accordingly was, tragically, absent from the German Spartacists and
the Hungarian communists in 1919. Practical Marxism never meant
abstention from specific struggles. As Luk&#225;cs argued, against his
&#8216;Menshevist&#8217; opponents, the defeat in Hungary occurred, not
because &#8216;historical processes&#8217; did not allow victory, but because
&#8211; in essence &#8211; the new Hungarian Communist Party &#8216;blew it&#8217;
through inexperience. <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a> It was precisely the capacity to make
serious assessments of situations, and then to intervene actively and
effectively, that Lenin, Trotsky and the best leaders of the new
Communist International attempted to instill in their comrades in
post-war Western Europe.</p>

<p>In the event, they failed. But for several years it was a
close-run thing. The consequences of the failure would mark the rest
of the 20th century. There followed a whole series of political
crises in which the possibility of significant revolutionary
intervention was posed. But by the mid-1920s those who held to the
tenets of Bolshevism had been marginalised. For the rest of the
century, they did not achieve implantation in Europe&#8217;s movements to
shape their development. They could and did provide a series of often
brilliant commentaries on events, demonstrating the dangers and the
bankruptcies of other tendencies, and outlines of how things might
have been different &#8211; but without the practical capacity to see
their standpoint win out.</p>

<p>Social democracy proved, time and again, incapable of responding
adequately to major crises or, worse, it played a conservative role &#8211;
in a pattern already established in the period before, during and
after the First World War. What was new was the evolution of the
official communist movement. The Russian Revolution&#8217;s isolation,
along with the multiple defeats and mistakes across Europe in the
early years after 1917&#8211;1918, produced the conditions for a
conservative &#8216;degeneration&#8217; of the Russian regime and, in
parallel, of the guidance it provided to communist parties elsewhere.
The internationalism of 1917 was replaced, by the mid-1920s, by the
predominance of Stalin&#8217;s doctrine of &#8216;socialism in one country&#8217;,
and an increasing subordination of the international communist
movement to the <em>raison d&#8217;&#233;tat</em> of the Russian state.
Official communist policy would veer and zigzag in all manner of
directions over subsequent decades, but never in a direction that
involved the development of a consistent revolutionary policy based
on real working class power.</p>

<p>Geoff Eley provides much of the materials from which it would be
possible to assemble this argument about post-1923 European
developments, and in that sense his book is useful as a source for
mining by socialists. But he doesn&#8217;t offer the argument itself. The
revolutionary left rather disappears from view in the rest of his
history &#8211; and thus also in his prognoses for the future.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>1924&#8211;1967</h4>

<p class="fst">The inter-war years turned into disaster both for the left and for
democracy in Europe. Social democracy collapsed in the face of
economic crisis, Stalinism triumphed in the USSR, the Nazis came to
power in Germany and then Austria, the Spanish republic was defeated,
and the world was plunged into the even more barbarous slaughter of
the Second World War. Eley&#8217;s book is unevenly helpful in
understanding these dreadful defeats.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s at his best dissecting the weaknesses of social democracy.
Organised reformism had emerged in a seemingly stronger position once
the years of revolutionary crisis had passed. Nowhere did this seem
more true than in &#8216;Red Vienna&#8217;. Yet, as he notes, there was a
&#8216;reformist conundrum&#8217; underlying the Austrian socialists&#8217;
achievements: &#8216;they depended ultimately on a prosperous
capitalism,&#8217; and they had no strategy for transcending capitalism&#8217;s limits:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The labour movement wielded impressive social power, as a
subcultural complex organising the community solidarity and everyday
lives of the working class in all the ways Red Vienna professed. Yet
the bridge from this subaltern collectivism to genuine political
leadership over society &#8211; hegemony in Gramsci&#8217;s sense &#8211; had yet
to be found. Translating the labour movement&#8217;s subcultural
influence into power in the state, through a non-insurrectionary
revolutionary strategy, was the problem. <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Reformism&#8217;s key theorists completely misestimated their
prospects. Hilferding argued that capitalism was now &#8216;organised&#8217;,
making democratic public control of the economy easier. Napthali and
others developed what they claimed was an alternative strategy to
Leninism, in which either reformism was capable of having
revolutionary consequences or (as Kautsky argued), since capitalism
automatically led to socialisation, socialists should do no more than
encourage capitalism&#8217;s maturation. As Eley notes, &#8216;This reliance
on capitalism&#8217;s future foundered in the 1929 crash&#8217;. <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a> The
German SPD accepted huge cuts in social spending and wages, believing
it more important to restore capitalism&#8217;s profitability than to
hasten its demise. They backed Germany&#8217;s conservative forces,
chiefly because of their fear of the Nazis, &#8216;while the socialist
rank and file suffered creeping demoralisation&#8217;. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a> Eley&#8217;s
summary of social democracy&#8217;s stance is correct:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Having rejected the Bolsheviks&#8217; vanguardist model of
proletarian democracy as authoritarian and counter-productive, a
recipe for destructive violence and self isolating dictatorship,
social democrats adhered rigidly to parliamentary rules, trapped in a
psychology of proceduralism and forever shying from the fight. This
hardwiring of social democratic imaginations into the integrated
circuits of parliamentary legality was the key to the post-1918
period. <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Faced with the threat of Nazism, the social democrats adhered, to
the bitter end, to their parliamentary cretinism, leaving their own
rank and file, many of whom were ready to fight, leaderless and
demoralised. Given their whole previous history, that was hardly
surprising. The problem in Germany was that no force to the SPD&#8217;s
left had a policy capable of pulling whole sections of the SPD&#8217;s
membership into joint anti-Nazi activity. And here the question of
the Communist Party, and the whole problem of Stalinism, is critical.</p>

<p>What is extraordinary about Eley&#8217;s treatment of this question is
that he has almost nothing to say about it. Famously, the German
Communist Party, following Stalin&#8217;s lead, declared that the German
social democrats were not potential allies in resistance to the Nazis
but &#8216;social fascists&#8217;, enemies of the working class equivalent to
Hitler&#8217;s forces. The KPD pursued a lunatic &#8216;ultra-left&#8217; course,
splitting rather than uniting the German workers&#8217; movement. But
Eley has nothing to say about the political effects of the theory and
practice of the Stalinist &#8216;Third Period&#8217;, or indeed about the
processes by which the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933. He
only notes that their &#8216;seizure of power&#8217; was a disaster for the
left, a &#8216;democratic catastrophe&#8217;. <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a> Nowhere does he consider
the respective roles of the SPD and the KPD in allowing this
catastrophe. If ever there was a case where events, and the
responsibility of various left forces for outcomes, demanded
analysis, this surely was it. But Eley &#8211; a notable historian of
Germany &#8211; offers nothing. If his lapse over Mussolini&#8217;s victory
was weird, his silence over Hitler&#8217;s victory, in a history of the
left and democracy, is an unbelievable error.</p>

<p>Eley&#8217;s treatment of Stalinism presents problems. The distance
between Eley and the tradition represented by this journal comes out
in a choice of phrase: &#8216;Revolutionary agency was exercised on
gargantuan scale in the Soviet industrialisation drive after 1929, as
Bolsheviks transformed their society <em>from above</em>&#8217; (my
emphases). <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a> Given that the Stalinist industrialisation drive was
premised on massive cuts in workers&#8217; wages, the reversal of
peasants&#8217; land gains in the 1917 revolution, and the extirpation of
any last remnants of soviet democracy, the term
&#8216;counter-revolutionary agency&#8217; seems more appropriate; while any
notion of serious political continuity between the revolutionary
Bolsheviks and Stalin&#8217;s Communist apparatchiks seems more than
dubious. While Eley offers some bare facts concerning the USSR,
European Communists&#8217; uncritical identification with its rulers,
their policies and purges, and the failures of the Popular Front and
the Stalin-Hitler Pact, he never offers any serious account of why
and how events in Russian happened as they did, and why the history
of the 20th century left is therefore so tragic. Yet the matter is
significant for his theme: were Russia&#8217;s rulers always in some
sense part of the left, or did they transmute into something else, to
become part of the problem facing the left? Did they indeed, as this
journal&#8217;s tradition has argued, become part of the ruling class of
modern world capitalism? If the former, then the story of the left
must be told in one way; if the latter, the history must be told
differently. Eley doesn&#8217;t pose the question, but his failure to do
so makes for an incoherent history that seems to straddle both
positions without recognising its own dilemmas.</p>

<p>Our tendency has argued for more than half a century that the
degeneration of the Russian Revolution of 1917 did produce a
qualitative shift to a form of capitalist class society. The
implication is, then, that Stalin and his heirs, and their policies,
are only part of the story of the left in two senses. First, they
developed as a significant part of world capitalism, with which the
left had to interact and which it had to oppose. Second, however,
large forces on the left failed to recognise that situation, with
immensely confusing and demoralising effects that revealed themselves
time and again. This is, in principle, quite as open to analysis as
the dependence of the German social democrats on the old regime, the
existence of many Tory voters within the ranks of the British working
class, and so on. The influence of Stalinism in working class and
&#8216;progressive&#8217; politics across the world for two generations
became nothing other than a case of the normal dominance of ruling
class ideas over the consciousness of the exploited and oppressed &#8211;
with the difference, of course, that the ruling class in question
happened to be abroad. Such a perspective makes it easier to
understand how, probably from the adoption of &#8216;socialism in one
country&#8217; in 1924 and the debacles of the British General Strike and
the Chinese Revolution, through the &#8216;Third Period&#8217;, and most
certainly from the adoption of the Popular Front onwards, &#8216;communism&#8217;
became a politics which first failed to threaten capitalism and
eventually &#8211; via Eurocommunism and its successors &#8211; turned into a
politics that embraced capitalism in the name of &#8216;realism&#8217;. Along
the way, &#8216;communism&#8217; in Europe became, like social democracy, in
practice counter-revolutionary in the strict sense that it opposed
popular revolution &#8211; in Spain during 1936 and after, in Eastern
Europe and Western Europe from 1944, in Hungary in 1956, in France in
May 1968, etc. Eley is too good a historian not to record the
transitions empirically. But he does not account for them. That
failure makes his history far less interesting and useful than it
might have been.</p>

<p>Eley&#8217;s history is better on the politics of the Popular Front in
France and in Spain, where he catches the subordination of class
politics to national politics. On France, he notes the revival of the
direct action spirit of 1917&#8211;1921, and the <em>&#233;lan</em> that
accompanied this. However, the Blum government wagered &#8211; like the
Austrian social democrats of the 1920s &#8211; on capitalist success to
fund their programmes, and then had no answer when capital went on
strike, abandoning its commitments and cutting back its social
legislation. Even here, Eley has no sense of the need for an
&#8216;eventful&#8217; history, in which the responses of different players
are analysed and explained at each juncture, and in which it is
possible to explore the kind of left interventions that were needed.
The sharpest light needs to fall on the French Communist Party, as
the most left wing of the forces involved. However, beyond noting
rightly that the PCF &#8216;sought to leash militancy as much as drive it
on&#8217;, Eley tells us little. <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a> He offers a summary answer to the
question, how might the debacle in France have been avoided?</p>

<p class="quoteb">This situation needed leaders of vision who commanded the
necessary political will &#8211; capitalising on the opening of June
1936, feeding the sense of historic opportunity, driving the
advantage home against the dominant classes, and finding the broadest
unity in the PCF&#8217;s sense. <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But if this is what was needed, what would it have demanded of,
say, the leaders of the PCF &#8211; given that such leadership would
never have come from the SFIO or the Radicals? In the real world, any
such leadership of vision must always be constructed in the face and
teeth of other, non-visionary leaderships within popular movements,
and that implies a struggle inside movements between rival
tendencies. Either such a struggle can be pursued with clarity, along
lines indicated by the earlier remarks about &#8216;Leninism&#8217;, or it
can be evaded in the spurious interests of an abstract &#8216;unity&#8217;
which involves conceding the struggle to those who would moderate and
disable the movement. <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a> How could or should the left have
responded to crises like the strike of capital? What would it mean in
practice to &#8216;drive the advantage home against the dominant
classes&#8217;? One feature would have to be further moves towards
socialisation, surely &#8211; and that would have involved, indeed
demanded, the further mobilisation of workers in the factories and
mines, etc. A logic akin to that of &#8216;1917&#8217; would have supervened
&#8211; against Stalin&#8217;s wishes, to be sure, and going far beyond the
limiting logic of the Popular Front. Popular mobilisations like that
in France in 1936 develop in one of two directions: either forward,
to an institutional remaking of politics and society that depends on
the mobilising power of millions, or backwards, to their own
demobilisation and demoralisation, and to a recuperation of ruling
class positions &#8211; sometimes at deadly cost. That choice of
direction appears at critical turning points in each movement&#8217;s
development, when the balance of forces within the movement as well
as between itself and its opponents is tested. Specific moments and
events matter. The experience of two centuries of mass movements
suggests that, even if each movement has its own historical
particularities, there is a kind of inescapable logic to these
moments of dilemma, and a left that is unable to respond decisively
to them declares its irrelevance or worse.</p>

<p>The Spanish Civil War produced yet another terrible defeat for the
left and for democracy. Eley offers sufficient materials to show what
a disaster the Popular Front was, both in Spain itself and
internationally, though he offers no suggestions about what
alternative policies were required. Though he&#8217;s correct, it&#8217;s not
enough to say, &#8216;Prosecuting the war with a central command while
securing the revolutionary gains were not mutually exclusive&#8217;. <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a>
As he says, the whole Popular Front strategy failed. That might
suggest that he would argue for some alternative, but he doesn&#8217;t.
He writes of Spain:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Comintern hoped to combine both the United Front of
working class parties and the broader Popular Front ... But many
divisions undermined the effort. The biggest of these pitted the
Comintern&#8217;s advocacy of self limiting republican defence, from
which specifically socialist demands were dropped, against the
desires of the people militant, for whom revolution was all. <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a></p>

<p class="fst">That &#8216;pitting&#8217; (as he records) included the Comintern&#8217;s and
the GPU&#8217;s use of terror against the POUM, etc. &#8216;in a disgraceful
copy of the Soviet purges&#8217;. <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a> From all of this, who could and
should learn what? In particular, who on the left should learn what?
While history may have been &#8216;bunk&#8217; for Henry Ford, for socialists
it can at least be a book of shocking lessons. But Eley doesn&#8217;t
draw any.</p>

<p>All in all, the 1930s were a dreadful decade for the left, only to
be followed by the barbarity of the Second World War. Perhaps the
&#8216;midnight of the century&#8217; was provided by Stalin, not just
entering a (soon to be dissolved) non-aggression pact with Hitler
that included the carving up of Poland between them, but actually
handing over German Communists to the Gestapo&#8217;s tender mercies as a
terrible coda to &#8216;socialism in one country&#8217;.</p>

<p>The death toll and destructiveness of the war were appalling, yet
the reformist left did manage to make some gains &#8211; not so much by
its own actions as a result of the Allies&#8217; final compulsion to
contain the fascist powers of Germany and Italy and also the Japanese
empire. In their victory, the Allies remade the world&#8217;s political
map, constructing new empires in place of the old and redividing the
world on new lines. That new world, by accident rather than design,
then entered a period of unparalleled growth and prosperity for a
quarter of a century. <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a></p>

<p>Eley suggests there was a brief moment at the end of the war when
other possibilities seemed to open up:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The left&#8217;s situation in 1945 was close to what the 1935
Popular Front strategy had imagined. The international coalition
against fascism had worked. Mussolini was deposed, Hitler defeated;
of the other rightist dictators only Franco in Spain and ... Salazar
in Portugal remained. The &#8216;workers&#8217; state&#8217;, the Soviet Union,
had emerged triumphantly from a war that had immensely boosted its
prestige. Broad coalitions for democracy and reform, so called
national fronts, were formed in most countries. United fronts between
Socialists and Communists were also common, especially locally all
over Europe. Radical changes seemed afoot. <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a></p>

<p class="fst">However, as he says, &#8216;the chance was fleeting&#8217; &#8211; it lasted
at most from 1943 to 1947. He dubs those years the &#8216;moment of
anti-fascist unity&#8217;, which he sees as a period of &#8216;radical
openness&#8217;. My feeling is that Eley rather exaggerates the potential
of this moment. His argument is that the Resistance organs in France,
Italy and elsewhere represented the seeds of a more democratic and
participatory alternative, and that their disbanding and disarming &#8211;
under Communist Party pressure especially &#8211; was a key defeat.
&#8216;These were&#8217;, he proposes, &#8216;the molecular forms of a different
course, analogous to the workers&#8217; councils that mushroomed across
Europe in 1917&#8211;1921. Both movements aspired to remake society in
just and egalitarian ways, organising food supplies, social
administration, and public order in the end of the war emergency,
while enlisting ordinary people&#8217;s energies and skills.&#8217; Eley
comments, by now characteristically, that what was lost was &#8216;the
chance for creative intermediate solutions ... for harnessing the
energy, idealism, and commitment of the people in motion, by building
new participatory forms into emerging constitutional settlements,
bridging the gap between national arenas and the local everyday&#8217;
(my emphasis). <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a> The difficulty is that the comparison with the
end of the 1914&#8211;1918 war goes only so far. First, the scale of
anti-fascist committees&#8217; organising capacity, their rootedness in
popular militancy and their connections to both workplace strength
and military mutinies were very much less; second, nowhere were
significant political forces capable of harnessing the undoubted
radical moods at the end of the war for really transformative
purposes, in competition with the demobilising policies of both the
Communist and social democratic parties. In Britain, nationalisation
was, as he says, &#8216;the socialisation of loss not profit&#8217; and
lacking any real socialist content. <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a> In his judgment,
&#8216;participation was the democratic fault-line of the post-war
settlements in Western Europe ... [There was] a sad contraction of
the democratic imagination. Politics was squeezed back into
parliamentary frames; other forms were forgotten&#8217;. <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a></p>

<p>The US played a key role in the post-war conservative
consolidation of Western Europe at the same time that, in Eastern
Europe, Moscow&#8217;s conservative ascendancy was brutally enforced. All
across Europe, even if by different means and even if in ways that
promoted popular living standards, labour remained firmly
subordinated to renewed capital accumulation.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>1968 and after</h4>

<p class="fst">&#8216;There is not much enthusiasm abroad among intellectuals in our
time&#8217;, wrote the (then) Trotskyist Alasdair MacIntyre in 1960, &#8216;for
the day when the last king will be strangled with the entrails of the
last priest&#8217;. <a href="#n83" name="f83">[83]</a> For more than two decades after 1945,
revolutionary (indeed, even radical) ideas were the property only of
tiny isolated sects &#8211; the groupuscules that Charles de Gaulle
derided (even as he banned them) in 1968. The predominant
conservative consensus, denying the possibility of radical social
change, affected even leading thinkers on the left. The most that
happened in the 1950s and early 1960s was a degree of repositioning
among the radical left: in particular, the brutal crushing of the
1956 Hungarian Revolution undermined the hegemony of Communist
parties on the left, and independent &#8216;new&#8217; lefts played
significant roles in, for example, French opposition to the Algerian
war and in the growth of CND in Britain. Two decades of full
employment bred a new degree of confidence among shopfloor workers,
represented by a rising tide of unofficial and wildcat strike action.
In addition, though Eley doesn&#8217;t mention this, a number of
important impulses crossed the Atlantic to Europe. The civil rights
movement in the US not only seized the imagination of European
radicals, but also provided the seedbed for several other important
developments. The student movement, which rapidly developed open
opposition to the US war in Vietnam, the first stirrings of a new
women&#8217;s movement, some of the earliest critiques of capitalist
ecology, and (a little later) new gay and lesbian liberation
movements all spread east from the US, to take on their own local
colours and forms across Europe.</p>

<p>These and other impulses came together in the extraordinary
explosion in France in 1968 &#8211; also the year of the Tet offensive,
of the birth of the civil rights movement in Ireland, and of much
more. May-June 1968 initiated a new period in the history of the
left. Eley provides a lively narrative of the May events, observing
about the crisis that followed the workers&#8217; rejection of the
Grenelle agreements:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The gap between the popular movement and the left&#8217;s
existing national leaderships now really mattered. The former had no
national structure. Ideal for some purposes, anti-centralism was
disabling in a general crisis of the state. <a href="#n84" name="f84">[84]</a></p>

<p class="fst">He goes on to discuss the government&#8217;s use of its centralised
forces to attack those strikers who continued, and equally the way
that the centralised French Communist Party stepped up its
denunciations of the students. Yet he draws no general lesson that
might inform the rest of his history of the last third of the 20th
century. What he does say is that &#8216;two lefts faced each other
across the frontier of de Gaulle&#8217;s 30 May address &#8211; one anxiously
awaiting normal politics to return, the other disbelieving they ever
could&#8217;. <a href="#n85" name="f85">[85]</a> On one side was an &#8216;old left&#8217; typified by the PCF,
and marked by conservatism; on the other was a &#8216;new left&#8217; marked
by anti-authoritarianism and the ideal of self management. I&#8217;m not
sure that Eley draws the line of division very accurately. The &#8216;old
left&#8217;, he suggests, spoke of &#8216;seizing power in the state&#8217; while
the new left spoke of beginning with a change in everyday life. These
ideas are what marks the post-1968 period from what went before:</p>

<p class="quoteb">From the fascination with direct democracy and
participatory forms through &#8216;permissiveness&#8217; to the enabling of
sexuality and the counter-culture&#8217;s hedonistic excess, from the
practical experiments with autogestion to the obsessive critiques of
alienation &#8211; in all these respects &#8216;1968&#8217; challenged the
hegemony of &#8216;1945&#8217;. The resulting conflicts took many years to
work themselves out, but over the longer term their effects were
huge. They redefined the ground of politics. They complicated notions
of the left. They changed established assumptions about where radical
democratic agency could be found. <a href="#n86" name="f86">[86]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Eley&#8217;s terminology is ambiguous: the old left&#8217;s concern, to
&#8216;seize power in the state&#8217;, might mean seizing state power
through revolution and might mean contesting elections in order to
obtain a modicum of state office. In reality the French Communist
Party (and other essentially reformist parties) saved the language of
&#8216;revolution&#8217; for May Day purposes &#8211; though Eley, oddly, refers
later to the (by then, Eurocommunist) parties of Italy, France and
Spain as &#8216;the last organised advocacy of revolutionary socialism in
Western Europe&#8217; <a href="#n87" name="f87">[87]</a>, rather ignoring the fact that they had ceased
to take such positions seriously since the 1920s! It might be more
illuminating to see the dividing line between the conservatism of an
old left and the radicalism of a new left as an issue between a
politics from above and from below. Among the new left there
continued to be a quite fluid debate about the appropriateness of
continuing with the language of &#8216;revolution&#8217;. Parts of the &#8216;new
left&#8217; proved perfectly capable of stepping back across the divide
and rejoining the &#8216;old left&#8217; (in the shape of the Communist and
social democratic parties). The new feminism or sexual
permissiveness, for example, was not automatically linked to
anti-authoritarianism or to ideals of self management.</p>

<p>That the &#8216;ground of politics&#8217; changed in important respects is
undeniable. Part of that involved a major (re)discovery of the
politics of gender and sexuality &#8211; the issue that most exercises
Eley. The very idea of socialism was hugely enriched by this. But
equally, an increasingly urgent critique of capitalist ecology
reshaped socialist thought, even if Eley has less to say about this.
His focus on matters posed by feminism means that he rather downplays
the importance of issues to do with immigration, racism and the
revival of fascism across Europe. He records the importance of racial
and other divisions, but remarks that &#8216;left parties largely evaded
the challenge of this popular divisiveness&#8217; <a href="#n88" name="f88">[88]</a>, which rather lets
those parties off the hook. In reality, they promoted racist division
via tightened immigration controls and the acceptance of arguments
about &#8216;acceptable numbers&#8217; of immigrants. That &#8216;New Labour&#8217;
under Blair and Blunkett has been even worse than &#8216;Old Labour&#8217; is
beside the point: Old Labour adopted shamefully racist positions from
1965 onwards <a href="#n89" name="f89">[89]</a>, while Communist parties accepted the &#8216;need&#8217;
for immigration controls, urging only that these should be
&#8216;non-racist&#8217; &#8211; whatever that meant!</p>

<p>Despite his attention to &#8216;second-wave feminism&#8217;, I suspect
that Eley actually underestimates its impact. He writes that it
&#8216;failed to institutionalise itself nationally&#8217; <a href="#n90" name="f90">[90]</a>, but doesn&#8217;t
allow for another possibility, which is that the women&#8217;s movement
did succeed, to adapt an idea from Edward Thompson, in warrening
society from end to end, even if like the 19th century workers&#8217;
movement it did not achieve its multiple ends. <a href="#n91" name="f91">[91]</a> If there was one
part of society it warrened with particular success, it was the
European left, many of whose fundamental assumptions about &#8216;class&#8217;,
&#8216;democracy&#8217; and the like were reshaped after the 1960s under its pressure.</p>

<p>Where Eley parts company with our tradition most seriously is in
his discussion of &#8216;class and the politics of labour&#8217;. <a href="#n92" name="f92">[92]</a> In
essence, he offers a version of Hobsbawm&#8217;s arguments about &#8216;the
forward march of labour halted&#8217;. Where, in the past, he suggests,
the socialist project was tied to an idea of the centrality of the
working class, itself rooted in &#8216;Fordism&#8217; (in essence, big
factories and Keynesianism), now that very basis of identification
has gone, along with the working class itself as a political
formation. Eley concedes that &#8216;class as an analytical category, and
as an organising condition of social life, may have remained&#8217; (I
like that may!), and indeed he is also correct that &#8216;its structure
and manifest forms had profoundly changed&#8217;. <a href="#n93" name="f93">[93]</a> It&#8217;s true that
&#8216;with new employment patterns, the geography and gender of
working-classness changed, as did the architecture of everyday life
in housing, family, sexuality, friendship, schooling, recreation and
leisure, and taste and style. So too did the cultures of
identification. It made a difference if the representative trade
unionists were coal miners, dockers, steel workers, machine builders,
and other men applying muscle and intelligence to arduous physical
tasks, or men and women sitting behind computers, canteen or laundry
workers in public institutions, or nurses&#8217; aids in big city
hospitals. The valencies of class as a basis for politics were
different&#8217;. <a href="#n94" name="f94">[94]</a> But so what? And how is that different from the
&#8216;cultures of identification&#8217; of the 1930s in the new car and
aircraft (mostly men) and light engineering (mostly women) factories,
which were initially seen as inherently closed spaces for trade
unionism, yet later viewed as central bastions of labour militancy
(and indeed of safe Labour voting)? In the end, the whole argument
comes down to this: is the place of class struggle in the battle for
socialism altered by ongoing sociological and cultural changes within
capitalism by, as it were, &#8216;structural&#8217; shifts in the
occupational composition of the working class, or is the politics of
the class struggle far more decisive? If, as Eley is inclined to
think, &#8216;class&#8217; as a basis for socialist politics is finished,
what on earth does &#8216;socialism&#8217; now mean? Are we to assume that
the politics of &#8216;new social movements&#8217; are to take the place of
class-based radical politics? Eley, picking up a widespread notion in
the 1980s and 1990s, is inclined to think that way. The view is one
he shares with the former Communist intellectuals who went on to
establish (and then dissolve) Marxism Today in Britain, and who gave
intellectual expression to the drift of much of the European left
away from &#8216;ultra-leftism&#8217; and towards an accommodation first with
social democracy and increasingly &#8216;market socialism&#8217; and indeed
just &#8216;marketism&#8217;.</p>

<p>The root of Eley&#8217;s view is a kind of sociological determinism,
which also underpinned much of the uncritical celebration of &#8216;new
social movements&#8217; in the 1980s and 1990s. <a href="#n95" name="f95">[95]</a> Eley inclines that way:</p>

<p class="quoteb">By the 1970s, the left had a central problem. As parties
traditionally based on the industrial working class, socialists and
Communists were appealing to ever smaller populations. Furthermore,
the remaining workers no longer saw themselves collectively in the
same way. As an operative identity &#8211; as the socialist tradition&#8217;s
organising myth, capable of inspiring collective action, of uniting
disparate categories of working people inside the same solidarity,
with enduring efficacy in politics &#8211; the &#8216;working class&#8217; was
losing its motive power.</p>

<p class="fst">In this double sense &#8211; in social structure and social
understandings, as the social aggregation of wage-earning positions
in industrial economies and as an organised political entity &#8211; the
working class declined. <a href="#n96" name="f96">[96]</a></p>

<p>True, he immediately adds, one kind of worker was being replaced
by another &#8211; Eley is too sophisticated to fall for a general thesis
of &#8216;deproletarianisation&#8217; &#8211; but nonetheless he identifies an
&#8216;unmaking&#8217; of the working class where previously there had been a
&#8216;making&#8217; (to borrow again from Thompson). And the logic
underpinning that unmaking is a semi-structural one.</p>

<p>There is an alternative account, which in my view makes far better
sense of the last three decades. <a href="#n97" name="f97">[97]</a> The great wave of popular
struggle that climaxed in Europe in the late 1960s and early 1970s
ran into essentially political barriers produced by the continued
dominance of social democratic and official Communist politics. It
subsided, and its decline was registered above all in terms of
industrial struggle. What contained and then pushed back working
class militancy was not immediately a direct offensive by capital and
states, but the collaborationist politics of union leaders and the
parties to which they were tied. Here our interpretation of the 1970s
differs very sharply from Eley&#8217;s. For him, the Social Contract
between the unions and the Labour government of the 1970s was given
&#8216;some much-needed social idealism and ethical drive&#8217; by Jack
Jones of the TGWU. <a href="#n98" name="f98">[98]</a> Eley makes no mention of the way both Jones
and the other major &#8216;left&#8217; union leader at the time, Hugh
Scanlon, encouraged scabbing, or of the fact that the British left
(both the International Socialists and the CP!) campaigned against
the Social Contract. Even his account of the decline of union
membership has to be qualified. The TUC&#8217;s weakness in Britain is
explained in terms of &#8216;the politics of a virulent anti-union drive&#8217;
<a href="#n99" name="f99">[99]</a> as if that determined the TUC weakness, rather than its own
bankrupt &#8216;new realism&#8217;, whose path had already been prepared by
the same Jones and Scanlon. None of the major defeats that working
class organisation undoubtedly suffered in the 1980s was somehow
inscribed in automatic social processes. Perhaps the greatest of
those defeats, that inflicted on the British miners, was quite as
&#8216;resistible&#8217; as fascism&#8217;s victories in the inter-war years.
Both problems in the strike&#8217;s leadership, and failures by other
union leaderships in the delivery of solidarity action created the
conditions for Thatcher&#8217;s victory over the miners. <a href="#n100" name="f100">[100]</a></p>

<p>Recovery from periods of defeat is a drawn out process, requiring
a regrowth of confidence, sometimes the emergence of a new generation
less marked by the scars of old battles, but should not be confused
with some terminal decline due to a change in the occupational
composition of the working class. <a href="#n101" name="f101">[101]</a> That there was a &#8216;downturn&#8217;
in working class combativity from the mid-1970s onwards is undeniable
<a href="#n102" name="f102">[102]</a>, but the sense we make of that period of retreat and defeat
must necessarily shape our whole political conception of what is
possible and necessary, and what the future may hold. Eley&#8217;s rather
deterministic position leads him to look for substitutes for working
class power as an agency of transformation, and thus not to consider
the possibility of a revival of working class organisation and
militancy. He does not, for example, take serious note of the huge
public sector strikes in France in 1995, nor does his whole account
prepare the reader for the large strike waves in Italy, Greece and
Spain in the context of the anti-war movement of the past year and
more. What he draws is a contrast between a rather rosy past and a
grim present:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Through these changes trade unionism lost its credentials
as a progressive force. Unions had always been intimately connected
with socialism. Beyond party-union relations was the larger sense of
trade unionism as the weapon of the weak, mobilising workers&#8217;
collectively organised strength as their only defence against
exploitation, social inequalities, and the power of capital. Trade
unionism was a class capacity, through which masses acting in unison
could have effects. Industrial strength was essential for immediate
improvement in wages and working conditions. But trade unionism was
also a larger vision, a collectivist ideal of the general good, a
desire for improving society, a general ethic of social solidarity
... Under welfare states, however, trade unionism stopped carrying
these hopes of the poor ... mainly trade unionism narrowed into
sectionalism. <a href="#n103" name="f103">[103]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One would not guess from this account that sectionalism had ever
been a problem in the past, and certainly not that trade union
history involves a dialectic of sectionalism and collectivism. The
history of trade unionism includes the engineers, who only admitted
women to membership in 1940, and even then in a special &#8216;section&#8217;.
Nor was sectional strength always a necessarily backward feature,
standing against the possibility of class identification: witness the
deployment of craft union strength in the shop stewards&#8217; movement
of the First World War.</p>

<p>By the 1990s, in Eley&#8217;s account, &#8216;the left was divided between
advocates of change and defenders of the faith. The former carried
the day&#8217;. <a href="#n104" name="f104">[104]</a> By 1990, it would be more accurate to say that his
&#8216;advocates of change&#8217; were giving up entirely on the possibility
of change, conceding victory to capitalism. That the left &#8211;
&#8217;defenders of the faith&#8217; &#8211; were very weak in 1990 is true, but
it will hardly do to place them in the camp of sad conservatives,
unable to see that the world had changed. It was not from the ranks
of the &#8216;advocates of change&#8217;, after all, that the new movements
against global capitalism at the turn of the new century would come;
the &#8216;defenders of the faith&#8217; embraced them readily.</p>

<p>Yet Eley also continues to provide good materials on this final
period. As so often, he is at his best documenting the failures of
reformist parties. He notes the way that the Eurocommunist strategy
in Italy ran into the sand, as the PCI (the Italian Communist Party)
became &#8216;the party of law and order, the bulwark of democratic
legality, the shield of the constitution&#8217; &#8211; only this was a
bulwark and shield defending a corrupt state still honeycombed with
DC vested interests, and a well-oiled machinery of paybacks and
private enrichment. Restricting public rights and expanding police
powers, the PCI&#8217;s anti-terrorist stance painfully compromised its
guardianship of civil liberties. By its strong alignment with the DC,
the PCI damaged its links to the broader left. &#8216;In the Historic
Compromise, the PCI rehearsed an old socialist dilemma, familiar from
Weimar and Red Vienna. By accepting the system&#8217;s premises &#8211; NATO,
the DC, Catholicism, and capitalism &#8211; the PCI took a deck already
stacked&#8217;. <a href="#n105" name="f105">[105]</a> Like Jones and Scanlon in Britain, they espoused a
version of the Social Contract, on the theory that workers&#8217;
sacrifices would save the economy and enable its reconstitution on
more equitable bases, linked to social reforms and stronger
democracy. What the theory meant in practice was demobilise your own
side, and expect to gain reforms! As Eley says, &#8216;By 1979, there was
little to show for this compromising. Inflation was down to 12.4
percent, and unions made big concessions on wage indexing,
redundancies, and productivity. But unemployment was rising and
workers&#8217; dissatisfaction was rife&#8217;. <a href="#n106" name="f106">[106]</a> In Spain, too, the
Communist Party pursued the politics of &#8216;pacts&#8217;, and lost out to
a revived social democratic party, the PSOE. In France they did no
better. Eley credits Eurocommunism with some civil reforms, and also
with a truly ambiguous achievement: &#8216;Eurocommunism brought southern
Europe into the fold of social democracy&#8217;. <a href="#n107" name="f107">[107]</a> Despite its
failures, he is warm to Eurocommunism: in making &#8216;broader appeals
to socially diverse support, from new professionals and white collar
strata to the university-educated and women&#8217;, the CPs:</p>

<p class="quoteb">... implied a different kind of party from before &#8211;
away from the Leninist party of militants, with its demands of time
and energy, and exclusive Communist loyalties; and toward the broadly
campaigning electoral party, with its looser structure of alliances
and less exacting identification, based on varied social
constituencies. Eurocommunist calls to democratise the party meant
not only dismantling centralism but also opening the party to diverse
currents and issues. Such issues posed a distinct challenge for
parties of the left, given their powerful class-political reflexes.
This agenda remained on the table.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, Eurocommunism opened greater space on the left for
radical democracy, suggesting a &#8216;third way&#8217; between Western
European social democracy and the official Communisms of the East. <a href="#n108" name="f108">[108]</a></p>

<p>Here Eley&#8217;s inexhaustible search for a &#8216;third way&#8217; leads him
seriously astray. Eurocommunism represented a further shift to the
right in Western Europe, with the rhetoric of &#8216;radical democracy&#8217;
as a partial cover. Moreover, the idea that some desirable path could
be found between a rightward moving social democracy and a decaying
Stalinism is hardly full of attractions for any kind of left!</p>

<p>Part of the difficulty is that, as we noted above, Eley never
really comes to terms with Stalinism. Its crisis in the 1980s leaves
him somewhat adrift. He continues to allow the use of the term
&#8216;socialist&#8217; in relation to Russia and Eastern Europe. <a href="#n109" name="f109">[109]</a> True,
many on the left in the West still maintained all manner of illusions
and identifications with the USSR and its satellites, but Eley never
gets behind this to consider its effects. As a result, he has some
difficulty with the explosions in Eastern Europe. While he notes,
rightly, that Solidarity in Poland &#8216;belonged squarely within
socialist traditions&#8217; even while its ideas had great difficulty in
finding expression in socialist language, and while he can properly
record that &#8216;it was certainly Europe&#8217;s most impressive working
class insurgency since 1917&#8211;23&#8217;, for him the outcome in
Jaruzelski&#8217;s declaration of martial law was &#8216;inevitable&#8217;. <a href="#n110" name="f110">[110]</a>
Sadly, he allows the Italian Communist Party to draw the moral from
Solidarity&#8217;s defeat:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We must accept that this phase of socialist development
(which began with the October Revolution) has exhausted its driving
force, just as the phase which saw the birth and development of
socialist parties and trade union movements mustered around the
Socialist International also ran out of steam ... <a href="#n111" name="f111">[111]</a></p>

<p class="fst">His halfway treatment of the nature of Stalinist societies leaves
Eley with an unanswered question: if these societies were in some
sense socialist, then isn&#8217;t his whole book&#8217;s stated theme that
there is a profound connection between socialism and democracy
flawed? Also, two things need to be explained about the East European
revolutions of 1989. First, why was there a low level of &#8216;social
movement&#8217; involvement, for example by comparison with the
Solidarity period in Poland, 1980&#8211;1981? Second, why did the new
governments embrace the market so eagerly?</p>

<p>On the first, he writes with some accuracy that &#8211; outside
Romania &#8211; the common organisational medium of the revolutions was
&#8216;the Forum&#8217;, which he describes thus: &#8216;a broad informal front,
hastily improvised, comprising mainly intellectuals, with unclear
popular support and not representative in any procedurally democratic
sense ... self constituted committees&#8217;. Yet he treats these as
somehow embodying &#8216;revived civil societies where democracy could be
regrounded, the sites of a &#8220;parallel polis&#8221;;&#8217; and he writes,
&#8216;The intense moment of the revolution as an immediate event was an
extraordinary laboratory of popular democratic initiative &#8211;
especially in the massed insurgencies of Czechoslovakia and the GDR
but also in the popular ferment of the negotiated transitions as
well, and in every small and everyday statement of rebellion across
the region&#8217;. <a href="#n112" name="f112">[112]</a> There&#8217;s a contradiction here, which Eley
doesn&#8217;t explore properly. Something was &#8216;missing&#8217; in 1989, and
it was surely any popular institutional initiative, itself a
necessary component of popular democratic insurgency. The Forums were
a way of avoiding this: in Poland, Lech Walesa was explicit about the
matter, declaring it a matter of principle that &#8216;the street&#8217;
should be excluded from the negotiations. The East European
revolutions had something in common with the &#8216;negotiated
transitions&#8217; in Spain, in Argentina and Brazil, etc: the people
were largely excluded, except when called on to participate in mass
demonstrations. In the GDR, indeed, the people seem to have
explicitly rejected the politics of the Civic Forum, and its
class-bound assumptions. <a href="#n113" name="f113">[113]</a></p>

<p>On the second question, Eley perceives a &#8216;painful dilemma for
the left&#8217; in the way that post-Communist governments shared a
neo-liberal belief in privatisation and marketisation. He comments,
&#8216;Private property, the market, capitalism &#8211; these were what
socialists wanted to overturn. Socialist readiness to embrace the
market, not in some Keynesian sense of the mixed economy but in a
more absolute sense, was a profound change. It became the common
ground of Eastern European reform&#8217;. <a href="#n114" name="f114">[114]</a> That it became &#8216;common
ground&#8217; is certainly true. But &#8216;socialist readiness&#8217;? Surely
the point is that there were never revolutions in which specifically
socialist ideas were less prevalent? The intelligentsia, by and
large, had given up on socialism, in any meaning of the term.
Thinking that Stalinism was socialism, and seeing the &#8216;socialism&#8217;
of social democracy as anyway largely empty and lacking in moral
vigour, they bought the neo-liberal idea that &#8216;freedom&#8217; was
indissolubly linked to the market. If critical Marxist voices were
thin on the ground in the West, they were even thinner in the East.
The few there had been (notably Kuron and Modzelewski in Poland) had
long abandoned their own revolutionary ideas; the Yugoslav Marxists
(and <strong>Praxis</strong>) had gone silent or converted to nationalism. Eley
writes of the &#8216;shock therapy&#8217; applied across the region, &#8216;This
was less the transition to democracy than the region&#8217;s brutal
subjection to the global capitalist system&#8217;. <a href="#n115" name="f115">[115]</a> His phrasing
would have been clearer if, in place of &#8216;less ... than&#8217;, he had
said &#8216;both ... and&#8217;, forcing the paradox to the surface, and
compelling inquiry into both the conditions that permitted such an
association to persist for a time and that, in the longer run, would
draw people from Eastern Europe into the anti-capitalist
demonstrations in Prague, Genoa and so on.</p>

<p>Eley&#8217;s account of the 1990s begins &#8211; rather peculiarly, given
that he has just recorded a whole series of revolutions in Eastern
Europe &#8211; by suggesting that the days of insurrection are past, &#8216;the
popular uprising, a pitched battle for the state amid the sudden
collapse of the system&#8217;. That he has a poor understanding of
insurrections is suggested by his comment that the &#8216;storming of the
Winter Palace&#8217; was the emblematic event of the October Revolution
in Russia. After 1917, he thinks, insurgencies became rare: &#8216;There
was one case of popular insurrection under late capitalism, namely
France in 1968, where liberal democracy was brought to a halt. And
the revolutions of 1989 produced systemic change on a transnational
scale. But otherwise, the insurrectionary fantasy &#8211; of a massed
uprising, paralysing government and violently seizing power &#8211;
largely disappeared&#8217;. <a href="#n116" name="f116">[116]</a> The whole account is a bit fantastical.
First, outside the imagination of movie-makers, there was never a
&#8216;storming of the Winter Palace&#8217;, which was actually taken by a
tiny group who slipped in through the back door. Nor was there, as
Eley&#8217;s own earlier account shows, an &#8216;insurrection&#8217; in France
in 1968. That any serious idea of socialist revolution has little in
common with Eley&#8217;s fantasies needs stressing: its &#8216;emblematic
events&#8217; are more likely to involve workers&#8217; self organisation,
often of a non-murderous kind, and not all at once, but as a
spreading and deepening movement combining economic and political
demands that pulls into its orbit all manner of other struggles
against oppression and the like.</p>

<p>Never mind. That was the fantasy, says Eley, and in his account
the disappointments of 1968 led some student radicals to chase it,
recreating the Leninist model &#8216;in the form of small and
hyperdisciplined sects, rejecting participatory ideals for the
panacea of the party&#8217;. I don&#8217;t know what company Eley kept, but
that was anything but universally true. That many leftists lapsed
into sectarianism is correct, but not all did. Perhaps what he terms
&#8216;sectarian militancy was thus little more than a noisy sideshow&#8217;,
but he needs at least to get his facts right about it. He has a
footnote saying that &#8216;Wishfully, the Socialist Labour League and
International Socialists declared Britain pre-revolutionary,
launching respectively the Workers Revolutionary Party (1973) and the
Socialist Workers Party (1976), each reaching a membership of several
thousand&#8217;. <a href="#n117" name="f117">[117]</a> If we leave aside the SLL/WRP, which was rather
prone to declare every temporary blip a terminal crisis, the IS/SWP
never declared Britain pre-revolutionary, and changed its name for
much more mundane reasons. But Eley, who has little time for the
revolutionary left, doesn&#8217;t bother to do his homework properly here.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s inclined to hope that &#8216;DIY&#8217; politics as exemplified by
raves, roads protests and Reclaim the Streets might offer part of a
way forward. Tentatively he suggests that some modest kind of
&#8216;localism&#8217; in economic policy might enable socialist ideas to
regain ground lost to neo-liberalism, and partly reclaim
collectivism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Modified Keynesianism was feasible &#8211; involving
decentralised public enterprise, tax concessions and public funds for
local initiatives, use of public resources like land and planning
permission for smaller-scale projects, community-based planning, none
of which meant reversing privatisation or relegitimising
nationalisation <em>per se</em>. <a href="#n118" name="f118">[118]</a></p>

<p class="fst">However, in a &#8216;brutally adversarial national climate&#8217;, those
backing such ideas &#8211; like the GLC of the 1980s &#8211; were
overwhelmed. The outcome was the &#8216;confusing picture&#8217; he finds at
the end of his story, in the late 1990s. &#8216;Socialists were governing
almost everywhere&#8217;, he suggests, adding, however, that these
&#8216;socialists returned to office with no economic design&#8217; <a href="#n119" name="f119">[119]</a> &#8211;
a judgement that is breathtakingly misdirected, certainly as far as
Britain is concerned. Blair and his &#8216;New Labour&#8217; government had a
definite economic design, taken over and developed from essentially
Thatcherite ideas, and they eschewed completely even the language of
socialism. In Germany, an official SPD intellectual declared that
&#8216;the left must stand up for consumer rights, free investment
decisions, the free disposal of assets, and a decentralised decision
making process&#8217;. <a href="#n120" name="f120">[120]</a> The &#8216;established socialist tradition&#8217;
had been left behind, capitalism&#8217;s ascendant forms were embraced,
and the rule of the market was accepted. Eley laments: &#8216;Socialists
had lost their confidence in the state. Without this Archimedean
point, <em>their capacity for imagining anti-capitalist alternatives
dissolved</em>&#8217; (my emphasis). <a href="#n121" name="f121">[121]</a> This catches the problem of
&#8216;the left&#8217; in ways Eley can&#8217;t quite grasp. What does seem true
is that the brand of reformist socialism that always looked to
statist solutions, which Marx and Engels criticised in its early
manifestations in the 19th century, and whose regular failings Eley
himself has documented in his account of the 20th century, is now
immensely weakened, as the rival statist &#8216;socialism&#8217; associated
with Stalinism is also finished.</p>

<p>Eley is inclined to regret their passing. We should not. What Eley
regards as the steady undermining of the socialist left over the past
third of a century involves several interrelated but partly
contradictory developments. What has not occurred is a diminution in
the potential strength of working class organisation, although the
undeniable shifts in occupational composition have altered the inner
organisational character of the social networks that make up the
contemporary working class. Stalinism &#8211; a huge impediment to
socialist politics all through the extended middle of the 20th
century &#8211; has been fatally weakened. As for social democracy, while
(as Eley remarks) its capacity for regeneration is considerable, the
very capitalist success on which it is premised looks more doubtful,
and the national-state reformism to which it appeals has been
extensively undermined by contemporary developments in world economy.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Looking forward and back</h4>

<p class="fst">So, finally, where are we now? Not, I think, in the rather
depressed environment that Eley offers us as his book ends with a
farewell to the 20th century. In the very last days of that century,
it was already apparent that rapidly expanding spaces were being
opened up, across Europe and the world, for new movements of
opposition to both capitalist globalisation and imperialist
war-making. If the demonstrations in Seattle at the very end of
November 1999 were a brilliant signal of what was to come, the
materials to make them had been prepared for several years before.
There are indeed plenty of &#8216;reasons to be cheerful&#8217;. <a href="#n122" name="f122">[122]</a></p>

<p>The long &#8216;downturn&#8217; of working class containment and defeat
that followed the upsurge of the 1960s no longer constrains the
aspirations and imaginations of new generations in the way it did
during the 1980s and much of the 1990s. The space for socialists to
spread their ideas has expanded hugely. Terms like &#8216;capitalism&#8217;
and &#8216;imperialism&#8217;, which might have seemed part of an antique
lexicon only a decade ago, are now part of everyday radical currency.
And all the issues in the great debates of the past are now
resurfacing: not just utopian ideas but also arguments about whether
and how they can be reconciled with practical strategising; serious
books on the feasibility of socialist economics are selling well
<a href="#n123" name="f123">[123]</a>; thousands upon thousands of activists organised the largest
demonstration in Britain&#8217;s entire history in February 2003, against
the war on Iraq; it may be that we are no nearer agreement about how,
in the words of a famous banner of 2002, to replace capitalism with
&#8216;something nicer&#8217;, but the question itself is very alive, as are
wide-ranging questions about the expansion of participatory
democracy. Barely commented on, too, because so taken for granted, is
the leading role that many young women play in the new
anti-capitalist movements, in ways that a previous generation of
women might only have dreamed of.</p>

<p>What, in the end, is sad about Eley&#8217;s history is that, as a
product of the dominant political sensibilities of the downturn
years, it never prepares the reader for the possibilities that are
now erupting around us. If Geoff Eley were to prepare a second
edition in a few years&#8217; time, I hope he might tell his tale rather differently.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f28" name="n28">28.</a> The same recognition was also manifested on the right. Roberto
Michels, in his <a href="https://archive.org/details/politicalparties00mich" target="new"><strong>Political Parties</strong></a> (first published in 1908),
developed the conservative side of the revisionist argument in the
direction of total elitist pessimism. The need for organisation, he
suggested, always and everywhere generated &#8216;oligarchy&#8217;, which
must itself impede the struggle for socialism. Thus socialism was,
through its inner necessities, impossible to achieve. For a critical
assessment of Michels&#8217; thesis, see C. Barker, <em>Robert Michels and

<p class="note"><a href="#f61" name="n61">61.</a> As above.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f62" name="n62">62.</a> In this respect, there is an important difference between the
mostly uncritical modern literature on &#8216;new social movements&#8217; and Marxism.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f63" name="n63">63.</a> Marxism was born out of reflection on the already developed
achievements and experience of workers&#8217; movements in Britain,
France, Silesia and elsewhere; Marx and Engels drew their account of
&#8216;the dictatorship of the proletariat&#8217; from the practices of the
Paris Commune; the Bolsheviks learned the significance of soviets
from the organisational accomplishments of Russian workers; Marxists
(where they were not utterly bone-headed) learned from the women&#8217;s
movements and the gay and lesbian movements of the 1960s and 1970s,
etc., etc. If, on the one hand, Lenin insisted that Marxist ideas
have to be imported into the spontaneous movement &#8216;from without&#8217;,
key steps in Marxism&#8217;s own development came to it equally from
&#8216;outside&#8217; its own ranks.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f64" name="n64">64.</a> If repeated sequences of events suggest there are
organisational patterns to such &#8216;mediating forces&#8217;, then further
theorisation is required. That theorisation may be initially rather
vulgar and insufficient. Thus it was with both &#8216;residual petty
bourgeoisie&#8217; and &#8216;labour aristocracy&#8217; theories of the roots of
revisionism in the early 20th century. On the former, see for example
C. Johnson, <em>The Problem of Reformism and Marx&#8217;s Theory of
Fetishism</em>, <strong>New Left Review 119</strong> (January&#8211;February 1980),
pp.&nbsp;70&#8211;96. On &#8216;labour aristocracy&#8217; theories of reformism,
see T. Cliff, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1957/06/rootsref.htm" target="new"><em>Economic Roots of Reformism</em></a>, <strong>Socialist Review</strong>
(June 1957); reprinted in T. Cliff, <strong>Marxist Theory After Trotsky:
Selected Writings</strong>, vol.&nbsp;3 (London 2003), pp.&nbsp;177&#8211;186.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f69" name="n69">69.</a> As above. One qualification: the &#8216;hardwiring&#8217; had been
largely accomplished well before 1914, as, for example, R. Miliband
showed long ago in his great <strong>Parliamentary Socialism</strong> (London
1961), a work unaccountably missing from Eley&#8217;s references.</p>
