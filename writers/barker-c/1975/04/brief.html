<h2>Colin Barker</h2>

<h1>In Brief</h1>

<h3>(April 1975)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>International Socialism</strong> (1st series), <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index3.html#isj077" target="new">No.77</a>, April 1975, p.32.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">WE&#8217;VE HAD plenty of occasion to call attention to interesting publications from Penguin Books Ltd. Their books have probably received more review space than any other publishers. It&#8217;s therefore especially appropriate that we express our solidarity with the trade unionists currently fighting 40 redundancies proposed by this company. Penguin are now owned by Longman-Pearsons, whose chairman, Lord Cowdray has a personal fortune estimated at the end of the 1960s at around &#163;100 million. Readers who feel that a little of Lord Cowdray&#8217;s money could be well spent saving jobs should send messages of support to Bert Williams, ASTMS Group Chairman, Penguin Books, Bath Road, Harmondsworth, Middlesex.</p>

<p>Pluto Press have a number of special offers which should prove to be of interest to <strong>IS</strong> readers. Their next four titles are all available at special pre-publication prices provided orders accompanied by cash reach them by the end of the stated month. April sees the publication of Moshe Lewin&#8217;s latest book, <strong>Political Undercurrents in Soviet Economic Debates</strong> (&#163;3.95, special price &#163;3.00) which will be a highly-prized item for anyone who has read any of his other books, most notably the fine <strong>Lenin&#8217;s Last Struggle</strong> (now in Pluto paperback at 90p). Also in April, a reprint of Carter Goodrich&#8217;s <strong>The Frontier of Control</strong>, the 1920 study of workshop politics in Britain (&#163;2.95, &#163;2.00 to those who have the readies in quickly).</p>

<p>In May come two books on the period of the Italian factory occupations: Paolo Spriano&#8217;s <strong>The Occupation of the Factories</strong> (&#163;2.00 special offer &#163;1.50) and Gwyn Williams&#8217; <strong>Proletarian Order, Gramsci and the factory councils</strong> (&#163;2.70 special price &#163;2.00).</p>

<p>Methuen Playscripts have just brought put an up-dated edition of Alan Plater&#8217;s <em>Close the Coalhouse Door</em>, with songs by Alex Glasgow (75p). Those who know the old version will enjoy the new scene and song on the 1972 miners&#8217; strike, with Ted at the helm. Glasgow fans will appreciate the music at the end.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t often give puffs to rivals, but the last but one <strong>New Left Review 87-88</strong> (double issue, 90p) has a first rate article by Jon Halliday, <em>Hong Kong: Britain&#8217;s Chinese Colony</em>. As Halliday says, the revolutionary left in Britain has largely ignored Hong Kong. The article proves we were wrong.</p>

<p>Basil Bernstein buffs might note a socialist magazine concerned. with language: <strong>Language and Class Workshop</strong>, 20p from Harold Rosen, 41a Muswell Avenue, London N10 2EH.</p>

<p>Teachers should read the latest &#8216;Rank and File&#8217; pamphlet, <strong>Teachers&#8217; Salaries: The Fight for a Single Scale</strong>, 20p plus postage from 86 Mountgrove Road, London N5. More than a discussion of wages, it&#8217;s about what a white-collar union ought to be.</p>
