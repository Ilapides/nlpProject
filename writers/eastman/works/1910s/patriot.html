<p>Nothing could be more calamitous than for patriotism to become the
established religion of this country. I do not know exactly what
religion is. Every psychologist has a different theory of its origin
and nature. Some say it originates in fear, others in wonder, others in
the filial affection, others in gregarious instinct&#8212;a desire for
infinite companionship. But I doubt if the religious emotion is any of
these single things, the same in different cases. I think that any
object or any idea which appeals to a <em>considerable number</em> of
our instincts, and offers them a <em>combined satisfaction,</em> may
become the focus of an attachment so controlling, and so <em>fix&eacute;,</em>

as to gain that uncanny and unreasonable priority among our feelings
which we call religious. The religious object binds us (as the Latin
original of the word implies), not by a single tie, but by gathering
into itself so many threads of our impulsive nature that no one motive
whatever can break its hold. God is indeed a refuge to our fear, a
temple to our wonder, a parent for the little child that lives in our
heart. He is an infinite companion. He satisfies so many of those
native cravings which the terms of life leave thwarted, that His hold
upon us becomes supernormal and sovereign, and our whole being is
transfixed by His name as though we were maniacs and He our obsession.</p>
<p>In order for this to happen, however, it is necessary that we have
the gift of making God seem real. In past ages, with a Christ or a
Virgin Mary giving the warmth of flesh to the picture, and a general
consensus of mankind supporting the opinion that God <em>is</em> real,
it was not difficult to acquire this gift. Perhaps almost a majority of
mankind possessed it, and the religion of God was one of the
determining forces in history. In this day, however, for many reasons,
it is growing difficult to make God seem real. The money and machine
character of our civilization leaves little room for miracles. A belief
in supernatural causes is dangerous in a factory and impractical in a
bank. And, moreover, Jesus Christ expressed so many principles of
conduct wholly out of accord with our industrial life, that the
ministers of his gospel are forced to deny him and betray his ideals
continually while asserting his godhead, and this makes them seem weak
and queer, and his godhead dubious. Deity is identified with the
church, and the church is hypocritical and alien to everyday life, and
so deity grows slippery and unpleasant to our minds. God is a long way
off. There is no sovereign motive in our lives.</p>
<p>That is good&#8212;It allows us to be intelligent and agile in various
kinds of enjoyment and enterprise. It lets us love truth more
whole-heartedly, and become acquainted with liberty. It is so lofty a
state, in fact, that most people have not the strength of stem to
endure it; they think they must find something to lean on and bind
themselves around. And so our godless age has been characterized by a
wistful hunger and search after religions. It is the age of &#8220;isms.&#8221; And
some of these isms have been able to bind together a number of native
impulses, and hold men almost as strongly as God did. Socialism with
its doctrine of Universal Brotherhood to be attained by the method of
Class War, offers almost infinite indulgence of two otherwise
unreconciled impulses&#8212;pugnacity and social love. With its system of
revealed economics, it offers, too, an Absolute in which mental
curiosity ran rest. It has its gospel according to Marx. Socialism is
no mean religion. But it is not a religion that binds or blesses the
rich and powerful, and so it could hardly become established in a
country like ours. For an established religion we needed something a
little more like God&#8212;a little vaguer and more elegant and better
adapted to bind in among other motives the economic self-interest of
those who rule. We needed something that would give us the same
emotional crystallization without greatly disturbing the profits on
capital.</p>
<p>Quite consciously a great many good people were searching for a
thing of this kind, for a new and vigorous religion. And now, through
the lucky accidents of history, they have found it. For there is
nothing more copiously able to bind into its bosom the multiple threads
of human impulse, and establish that fixed and absolute glorious
tyranny among our purposes, than military patriotism. You will see how
everything that was erect in this country bows down to that sentiment.
The love of liberty, the assertion of the rights of man, what little of
the ethics of Jesus we had&#8212;these things must obviously yield. And not
only these, either, but the common principles of morality and truth. We
shall see men devoting their utmost energy to an endeavor which they
declare to be evil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladly would I have given my life to save my country from war,"
says William J. Bryan, &#8220;but now that my country has gone to war, gladly
will I give my life to aid it.&#8221; This Christian gentleman, whose
morality was perhaps the most rigid thing we had in the country, thus
boasts that he will devote his declining years to a cause which he
considers wicked. Like Abraham who would slaughter his son at the
bidding of God, Bryan is ready to do murder&#8212;he has called it
murder&#8212;for the sake of his country. And this seems entirely right and
noble to his countrymen. To me it seems utterly ignoble.</p>
<p>Not only morality, either, but the ideal of intelligence itself, of
truthful seeing, will be abandoned. Men will glory in the ignorance and
celebrate the stupidity of what they are doing. &#8220;I shall vote,&#8221; said
Senator Stone, against &#8220;the greatest national blunder of history,&#8221; but
after that &#8220;my eyes will be blind to everything but the flag of my
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>When ordinary alert perception has been renounced, it is needless to
say that the extreme ethical visions of Jesus must go, and that
God&#8212;long suffering God&#8212;will be denounced from the pulpits that were
his last refuge. I suppose the pew-holders of Henry Ward Beecher&#8217;s
church are satisfied with Newell Dwight Hillis, for they have stood a
good deal from him besides his preaching, and here is his creed of
patriotism:</p>

<p class="quote">"All God&#8217;s teachings about forgiveness should be
rescinded for Germany. I am willing to forgive the Germans for their
atrocities just as soon as they are all shot. If you would give me
happiness, just give me the sight of the Kaiser, von Hindenburg and von
Tirpitz hanging by the rope. If we forgive Germany after the war, I
shall think the whole universe has gone wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>When God is thus enthusiastically ejected from the rostrum of the
most famous church in the country, to make way for the patriotic
emotion, I think we are justified in the fear that patriotism may
become our religion.</p>
<p>Patriotism indulges that craving for a sense of union with a
solitary herd, which is an inheritance of all gregarious animals. It is
a craving which our modern sophisticated, citified, and diverse
civilization leaves unfed in normal times. There is a great swing
towards war on this account even among the most pacific people. They
are flocking for a drink of this emotion. Men are willing to be dead,
if they can only be dead in a pile.</p>
<p>This quite organic and almost animal craving is what makes us talk
so much about the &#8220;great spiritual blessing&#8221; that war will bring to our
unregenerate characters. When a desire springs so deeply from our
ancient inheritance as this gregarious hunger does, we always feel it
as mystic and inscrutable, we attribute a divine beneficence to the
satisfaction of it. As a matter of fact, it would be better for the
progress of society, in science and art and morality and happiness, if
this terrible solidarity could be mitigated instead of enlarged. For it
inhibits individual experiment, and it falsifies the facts of life,
always pretending the nation is more socially and brotherly organized
than it is. The &#8220;great spiritual blessing&#8221; is in fact a distraction of
men&#8217;s minds from the pursuit of truth and from realistic progress. It
is the temporary indulgence of a facile emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I pray God,&#8221; said President Wilson at the dedication of a Red Cross
Memorial, &#8220;that the outcome of this struggle may be that every element
of difference amongst us will be obliterated....The spirit of this
people is already united and when effort and suffering and sacrifice
have completed this union, men will no longer speak of any lines either
of race or association cutting athwart the great body of this nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the instinctive man, the altogether righteousness of this
aspiration, and the entire beneficence of the condition outlined, is as
much taken for granted as the goodness of virtue. And yet, if seriously
considered, such a state of affairs would be aesthetically monotonous
and morally stagnant. Aside from the mere satisfaction of the old
instinct for herd-union itself, there would be no health, no beauty, no
life in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liberty and Union, One and Inseparable, Now and Forever,&#8221; is the
watchword that adorns the statue of Daniel Webster in Central Park. And
that too seems obvious&#8212;it has become a proverb. And yet if it has any
meaning whatever, the meaning is false. It has become proverbial merely
because it celebrates, with some show of regard for individual freedom,
this gregarious instinct of mankind which is the central armature of
the religion of patriotism.</p>
<p>According to my idea, however, the satisfaction of a single
instinct, even though so arbitrary and ancient-rooted as this, cannot
acquire that peculiar hypnotizing force upon us which makes us name it
religious. We might love union and the monotony of the herd very much,
and still continue to act morally, and exercise intelligent judgment,
and perhaps love God and walk humbly with our neighbor. But it happens
that the moment we declare for the herd, and let loose our enthusiasm
into that vent, especially at war time, a half dozen other starved
monsters of passionate desire that our lawful and cultivated life has
caged and thwarted rush to this outlet and find satisfaction.</p>
<p>One of them is angry hate. Men are full of it, and they get small
chance to exercise it in these days of legality and respectable
convention. The war liberates them. They can rage and revile and spit
upon the enemy with the sanction of all contiguous society, and without
immediate personal danger. I think this is what makes a declaration of
war especially palatable to ministers of Christ. They have repressed so
much more personal spleen, as a matter of professional necessity, than
the rest of us, that they let go all the more violently into the
national spout. Nobody will demand that they apply the ethics of Jesus
to the relations between nations; they can go on preaching forgiveness
as a personal matter, while enjoying in this national festival the
emotions of implacable hate.</p>

<p>Here is a conversation overheard in a restaurant conducted by two
innocent and colorless Germans, man and wife. The talkers are American
patriots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you read what Ambassador Gerard said about the German boys
torturing foreigners in Germany?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and it&#8217;s true too. They&#8217;re cruel. They&#8217;re savages, the
Germans. They wouldn&#8217;t stop at anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet, look at these people. I bet they&#8217;re spies. We&#8217;ll be over
there and string them up one of these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sudden and copious flow of malice which follows a declaration of
war suggests that a really dire condition of the natural organs has
been relieved just in the nick of time. Another and even more bursting
reservoir that ordinary moral conduct never half relieves is rivalrous
egotism. Society suppresses the braggart, for the reason that if
bragging is to be done, each member of society feels fully entitled to
do it, and there is no other solution short of bedlam. In consequence
every individual is full as a bladder with inexpressible self-esteem.
And by a quickly articulated emotional device, this passion too is
sluiced into the channel of patriotism. A man identifies himself with
his country, and then he brags about his country to his heart&#8217;s desire,
and nobody observes that he is bragging about himself. Only sensitive
people know that patriotic loyalty is so much less flame-like and
beautiful than loyalty to a friend or an idea&#8212;they feel this cold vein
of complacence in it.</p>
<p>The patriotic religion has a hold here that God never had. God
wanted people to be humble. A religion that lets us brag without
knowing that is what we are doing is far more gratefully adjusted to
our constitutions. We can love our country and make sacrifices for it,
we can have all those altruistic satisfactions, and yet not suffer the
self-abasement that is inevitable in loving a Supreme Being. It is our
country; it is not simply Country, abstract and awful.</p>
<p>Our country comforts us too, even as God&#8217;s fatherhood did. Our
filial affection is gathered up into the bosom of the fatherland. We
were conceived and born in its bosom; it is our native place, the place
that sheltered us long ago when we were happy; it will still care for
us (especially while we are fighting for it), and give us that sense of
the Everlasting Arms without which perhaps no religion would retain its
extreme dominion among our feelings.</p>
<p>Yes, patriotism binds us by as many ties as God. We need not be
surprised at those Methodist conventioners, who denounced for treason
the lowly delegate who wished to put God before his country. In the
very nature of the case, if our theory of religion is true, there can
be no two religions. If God will not fall in step with the United
States army, God must go. That has been made plain in every pulpit in
this vicinity, with the noble exception of the Church of the Messiah,
where John Haynes Holmes spoke not only for the sovereignty of God, but
even for the ethics of Jesus, on the eve of War.</p>
<p>Patriotism has, like other religions whose object of worship is a
little open to question, its extreme sensitiveness, its fanatical
intolerance. The ceremonial observances are enforced with zealotry, and
those who blaspheme with unassenting presence are likely to be thrown
out bodily or confined in jail. At one of the meeting-places of
patriots on Broadway, known as Rector&#8217;s, one night at two A. M. the
ceremonial of the national anthem was being enacted, and while all the
devotees were rising or being assisted to their feet, Mr. Fred Boyd and
two companions&#8212;heretics of this religion&#8212;endeavored quietly to remain
in their seats. Chairs, tables and salad bowls were employed by the
orthodox to enforce the tenets of their creed, and these failing, a
policeman was summoned in the name of the fatherland, and Mr. Boyd and
his companions arrived at the night court. Here they were severely
reprimanded by a judge, who acknowledged, however, that they had
disobeyed no law, not even the law of God, which is usually invoked
upon such unfortunates as wish to act upon their own judgment in public.</p>

<p>To me patriotism, in practically all of its forms, is distasteful.
And I confess to a feeling of strange solitude in these days of its
divinity that no other revolutionary opinions have brought me. Much of
the time I wonder what it is that separates a handful of us from the
concourse of mankind. We are so motley a handful: Christians, Atheists,
Quakers, Anarchists, Artists, Socialists, and a few who just have a
fervent pleasure in using their brains about truth. You could bring us
together, and we would not agree upon anything else under the sun&#8212;but
we agree in disliking the religion of patriotism. We can not stand up
when the national anthem is played, not because we have any theory
about it, but because the quality of the emotion expressed is alien and
false to us. We cannot partake of the communion and be true to
ourselves. And so many of us do not go to these meeting-places at all,
or we come in late, or otherwise we try to avoid the acute discomfort
of sitting quiescent under the scowling malice and ignorant suspicion
of a mob indulging its fixed and habitual emotion.</p>
<p>As I count over the little group that I know who feel this way about
committing themselves to the new religion, I find two or three traits
that seem somewhat to explain it. Some of the group are platonic in
their temperament&#8212;given, that is, to falling in love with ideas. And
so many beautiful ideas, like justice and proportion and mercy and
truth, have to be renounced and reviled in abandoning oneself to this
religion, that they find it absolutely impossible. They can not tear
themselves away from their loves.</p>
<p>Others are temperamentally solitary. They are actually lacking in
gregarious impulse, or have an opposite impulse to kick out and desert
whenever the herd agrees upon something. They cannot even understand
patriotism, and these modern days make them not only sad, but bitter
and contemptuous of men.</p>
<p>Others are rationalistic, and have a theory about patriotism, and
their emotions are controlled by a theory. But there are not many whose
emotions are controlled by a theory.</p>
<p>The character that is most common to those who cannot commit
themselves to this religion, is the character of having already really
committed themselves to something else. And this too is rare enough.
Most of the people in our days of nervous modernity&#8212;busy with labor,
or busy with entertainment-never heartily abandon themselves to
anything. Such people welcome the orgy of nation-worship merely as a
chance to feel.</p>
<p>I think of Mayor Mitchel, for example, as a little fox-like
political man, who has stepped very carefully here and there, taking a
bit, giving a bit, to this and to that&#8212;church, politics, business,
society, dress. He shows very plainly that he never abandoned his soul
to any purpose or any experience. But now he has&#8212;and it is doing him
good. One cannot but smile in sympathy with the Mayor&#8217;s boyish
extravagance in this the first experience of his life. One cannot but
wish him the good luck of other experiences before he dies. And he is
typical of the average man and man-of-affairs. They go in for this
facile religion of the fatherland, or at least they show no resistance
against it, because they not only are not committed to anything else,
but they never have been committed to anything. Other religions always
seemed to require courage, or faith, or loneliness, or
energy-of-intent; this requires only the most social and joyful
abandonment of intelligent judgment and moral restraint. It is the
easiest religion under the sun to feel and feel deeply, for it gives
the highest quantity of satisfactions, requires no imaginative faith,
and demands only at the most that physical crowd-courage which is our
common heritage.</p>
<p>I do not believe many people will ever be led to feel unpatriotic.
To argue against these tribal and egoistic instincts is like arguing
against gravitation. But I do hope that a fair proportion of the
intelligent may be persuaded to resist the establishment, in their own
minds or in American society, of patriotism as a religion. Let them
understand that to indulge and satisfy some one or two of the emotions
that enter into this compound, is a very different thing from binding
all these satisfactions into a fixed and rigid and monumental sentiment
which will exercise absolute dictatorship in their minds. Strong minds
do not need any religion. They are able to bear the responsibility and
the labor of thinking and choosing among the values of life anew every
morning. But even for those who must have a religion, an exposure of
the extreme easiness of patriotic enthusiasm, its quality of general
indulgence, might make them wish to bind themselves, if they must be
bound, to some god that is more arduous and demanding of personal
character.</p>
