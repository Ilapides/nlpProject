 <p>It was never a question of making people believe in the benefits of
women&#8217;s freedom, it was a question of making them <em>like the idea.</em>
And all the abstract arguments in the world furnished merely a sort of
auction ground upon which the kindly beauties of the thing could be
exhibited. Aristotle, in his hopeful way, defined man as a &#8220;reasonable
animal,&#8221; and the schools have been laboring under that delusion ever
since. But man is a voluntary animal, and he knows what he likes and
what he dislikes, and that is the greater part of his knowledge.
Especially is this true of his opinion upon questions involving sex,
because in these matters his native taste is so strong. He will have a
multitude of theories and abstract reasons surrounding it, but these
are merely put on for the sake of gentility, the way clothes are. Most
cultivated people think there is something indecent about a naked
preference. I believe, however, that propagandists would fare better,
if they were boldly aware that they are always moulding wishes rather
than opinions.</p>
<p>There is something almost ludicrous about the attitude of a
professional propagandist to his kit of arguments&#8212;and in the suffrage
movement especially, because the arguments are so many and so old, and
so classed and codified, and many of them so false and foolish too. I
remember that during the palmiest days of the abstract argument (before
California came in and spoiled everything with a big concrete example)
I was engaged in teaching, or endeavoring to teach, Logic to a division
of Sophomores at Columbia. And there was brought to my attention at
that time a book published for use in classes like mine, which
contained a codification in logical categories of all the suffrage
arguments, both pro and con, and <em>a priori</em> and <em>a
posteriori,</em> and <em>per accidens</em> and <em>per definitionem,</em>

that had ever been advanced since Socrates first advocated the
strong-minded woman as a form of moral discipline for her husband. I
never found in all my platform wanderings but one suffrage argument
that was not in this book, and that I discovered on the lips of an
historical native of Troy, New York. It was a woman, she said, who
first invented the detachable linen collar, that well-known device for
saving a man the trouble of changing his shirt, and though that
particular woman is probably dead, her sex remains with its pristine
enthusiasm for culture and progress.</p>
<p>But the day of the captious logician, like the day of the roaring
orator, is past. What our times respond to is the propagandist who
knows how to respect the wishes of other people, and yet show them in a
sympathetic way that there is more fun for them, as well as for
humanity in general, in the new direction. <em>Give them an hour&#8217;s
exercise in liking something else</em>&#8212;that is worth all the proofs
and refutations in the world. Take that famous proposition that &#8220;womans
sphere is the home.&#8221; A canvass was made at a women&#8217;s college a while
ago to learn the reasons for opposing woman suffrage, and no new ones
were found, but among them all this dear old saying had such an
overwhelming majority that it amounted to a discovery. It is the
eternal type. And how easy to answer, if you grab it crudely with your
intellect, imagining it to be an opinion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Woman&#8217;s sphere is the home!&#8221; you cry. &#8220;Do you know that according
to the census of 1910 more than one woman in every five in this country
is engaged in gainful employment?</p>
<p>&#8220;Woman&#8217;s sphere is the home! Do you know where your <em>soap</em>
comes from?</p>
<p>&#8220;Woman&#8217;s sphere is the home!&#8212;do you know that in fifty years all
the work that women used to do within the four walls of her house has
moved out into  the &#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Woman&#8217;s sphere is the home! Do you know that, as a simple matter of
fact, the sphere of those women who most need the protection of the
government and the laws is <em>not</em> home but the factory and the
market!</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, to say that woman&#8217;s sphere is the home after the census says
it isn&#8217;t, is like saying the earth is flat after a hundred thousand
people have sailed round it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well&#8212;such an assault and battery of the intellect will probably
silence the gentle idealist for a time, but it will not alter the
direction of her will. She never intended to express a statistical
opinion, and the next time you see her she will be telling somebody
else&#8212;for she will not talk to you any more&#8212;that &#8220;woman&#8217;s <em>proper</em>
sphere is the home.&#8221; In other words, and this is what she said the
first time, if you only had the gift of understanding, &#8220;I like women
whose sphere is the home. My husband likes them, too. And we should
both be very unhappy if I had to go to work outside. It doesn&#8217;t seem
charming or beautiful to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now there is a better way to win over a person with such a gift of
strong volition and delicate feeling, than to jump down her throat with
a satchel full of statistics. I think a propagandist who realized that
here was an expression primarily of a human wish, and that these
wishes, spontaneous, arbitrary, unreasoned, because reason itself is
only their servant, are the divine and unanswerable thing in us all,
would respond to her assertion more effectively, as well as more
pleasantly.</p>
<p>The truth is that any reform which associates itself with the name
of liberty, or democracy, is peculiarly adapted to this more persuasive
kind of propaganda. For liberty does not demand that any given person&#8217;s
tastes or likings as to a way of life be reformed. It merely demands
that these should not be erected into a dogma, and inflicted as
morality or law upon everybody else. It demands that all persons should
be made free in the pursuit of their own tastes or likings.</p>
<p>Thus the most ardent suffragist might begin by answering our
domestic idealist&#8212;"Well, I suppose it is a charming and beautiful
thing for you to stay in your home, since you are happy there. I myself
have a couple of neighbors who have solved their problem of life that
way too, and I never have an argument with them. Why? Because they
recognize that all people&#8217;s problems are not to be solved in the same
way. They recognize the varieties of human nature. They recognize that
each one of us has a unique problem of life to solve, and he or she
must be made free to solve it in her own unique way. That is democracy.
That is the liberty of man. That is what universal suffrage means, and
would accomplish, so far as political changes can accomplish it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us agree that woman&#8217;s proper sphere is the home, whenever it
is. But there are many women who, on account of their natural
disposition perhaps, or perhaps on account of their social or financial
situation, cannot function happily in that sphere; and they are only
hindered in the wholesome and fruitful solution of their lives by the
dogma which you and your society hold over them, and which is
crystallized and entrenched as political inequality by the fundamental
law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus our agitation of the woman question would appear to arise, not
out of our own personal taste in feminine types, but out of our very
recognition of the fact that tastes differ. We would propagandize, not
because we are cranks and have a fixed idea about what everybody else
ought to become, and what must be done about it at once, but because we
are trying to accept variety and the natural inclinations of all sorts
of people as, by presumption at least, self-justified and divine. We
want them all to be free.</p>

<p>Such is the peculiar advantage that the propaganda of liberty has
over all the evangelical enthusiasms. It does not at the first gasp ask
a man to mortify his nature. It merely asks him to cease announcing his
own spontaneous inclinations as the type and exemplar of angelic
virtue, and demanding that everybody else be like him. It tries to
remove another old negative dogmatic incubus from the shoulders of
life, aspiring toward variety and realization. That is what the
suffrage propaganda is doing.</p>
<p>It would be folly to pretend, however, that the principle of equal
liberty is the only motive behind the suffrage movement. I have said
that it is the primary one. It is at least the broadest, the surest,
the one upon which the conversion of a person whose taste opposes yours
can be most graciously introduced.</p>
<p>But there is yet another way of changing a person&#8217;s wish, and that
is to show him that he himself has deeper wishes which conflict with
it. And there is one deep wish in particular that almost all women, and
most men possess, and that is a wish for the welfare and advancement of
their children. And just as &#8220;Woman&#8217;s sphere is the home&#8221; typifies the
voluntary force opposing woman suffrage, so &#8220;Women owe it to their
children to develop their own powers,&#8221; typifies the force that favors
it.</p>
<p>Universal citizenship has meant in human history universal
education. That has been, next to a certain precious rudiment of
liberty, its chief value. That will be its chief value to women for a
long time to come. And by education I do not mean merely political
education. I do not mean that it will awaken in women what we call a
"civic consciousness,&#8221; though it will, I suppose, and that is a good
thing.  Then that by giving to women a higher place in our social esteem, it will
promote their universal development.</p>
<p>We are not educated very much by anything we study in school or see
written on the blackboard. That does not determine what we grow up to
be. The thing that determines what we grow up to be is the natural
expectations of those around us. If society expects a girl to become a
fully developed, active and intelligent individual, she will probably
do it. If society expects her to remain a doll-baby all her life, she
will make a noble effort to do that. In either case she will not
altogether succeed, for there are hereditary limitations, but the
responsibility for the main trend of the result is with the social
conscience.</p>
<p><br>
"Sugar and spice and everything nice,<br>
That is what little girls are made of;<br>

Snips and snails and puppy-dogs&#8217; tails,<br>
That is what little boys are made of."<br>
</p>
<p>There is an example of what has been educating us. That kind of
baby-talk has done more harm than all the dynamite that was ever let
off in the history of the world. You might as well put poison in the
milk.</p>
<p>All that is to be ended. And this is the chief thing we expect of
women&#8217;s citizenship. It will formulate in the public mind the higher
ideal that shall develop the young girls of the future. They will no
longer grow up to be, outside the years of motherhood, mere drudges or
parlor ornaments. They will no longer try to satisfy their ambitions by
seeing who can parade the most extreme buffooneries of contemporary
fashion on the public highway. They will grow up to be interested and
living individuals, and satisfy their ambitions only with the highest
prizes of adventure and achievement that life offers.</p>
<p>And the benefit of that will fall upon us all&#8212;but chiefly upon the
children of these women when they are mothers. For if we are going
anywhere that a sane idealism would have us go, we must first stop
corrupting the young. Only a developed and fully constituted individual
is fit to be the mother of a child. Only one who has herself made the
most of the present, is fit to hold in her arms the hope of the future.</p>
<p>We hear a good deal about &#8220;child-welfare&#8221; in these days, and we hear
the business of child-welfare advanced as one of the arguments for
woman suffrage. To me it is almost the heart of the arguments, but it
works in my mind a little differently from what it does in the minds of
the people who write the child-welfare pamphlets. I do not want women
to have, for the sake of their children, the control of the milk-supply
and the food laws, half so much as I want them to have, for the sake of
their children, all the knowledge-by-experience that they can possibly
get. That is the vital connection between child-welfare and woman
suffrage&#8212;that is the deeper ideal. No woman is fit to bring children
into this world until she knows to the full the rough actual character
of the world into which she is bringing them. And she will never know
that until we lift from her&#8212;in her own growing years&#8212;the repressive
prejudice that expresses itself and maintains itself in refusing to
make her a citizen.</p>
<p>A man who trains horses up in western New York put this to me very
strongly. &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to breed race-horses,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you don&#8217;t
pick out your stallions on a basis of speed and endurance, and your
mares according to whether they have sleek hides and look pretty when
they hang their heads over the pasture fence. And if you&#8217;re going to
raise intelligent citizens you&#8217;ll have to give them intelligent
citizens for mothers.&#8221; I do not know whether he was aware that an
actual tendency to <em>select</em> the more intelligent, rather than a
mere training of the intelligence of all, is the main force in racial
evolution. But that is what he said. And, either way, it is a piece of
cold scientific fact. The babies of this world suffer a good deal more
from silly mothers than they do from sour milk. And any change in
political forms, however superificial from the standpoint of economic
justice, that will increase the breadth of experience, the sagacity,
the humor, the energetic and active life-interest of mothers, can only
be regarded as a profound historic revolution.</p>

<p>In these broad effects upon the progress of liberty and life, not in
any political result of equal suffrage, are to be found an object of
desire which can rival and replace the ideal that opposes it. They are
the material for the propaganda of the will. And while we noisy orators
are filling the air with syllogisms of justice, and prophecies of the
purification of politics, and the end of child labor, and what women
will do to wars, and the police department, and the sweat-shops, and
the street-cleaning department, and the milk-wagons, and the dairy
farms, and how they will reform the cows when they come into their
rights, we ought to remember in our sober hearts that those large warm
human values, which have nothing to do with logic or politics or
reform, are what will gradually bend the wishes of men toward a new age.<br>
