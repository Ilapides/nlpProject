<h4>Indicted for Criminal Libel</h4>

<br />
<br />
<p>Our readers will wish to know these facts:</p>

<p>Last summer, after a number of publications, including <em>Collier&#8217;s
Weekly</em> and <em>The Independent,</em> had delicately intimated
that the Associated Press gave the country no fair amount of the
struggle between labor and capital in West Virginia, <em>THE MASSES</em>
decided to look into the case. It decided that if this thing were true,
it ought to be stated without delicacy.</p>
<p>The result was a paragraph explicitly and warmly charging the
Associated Press with having suppressed and colored the news of that
strike in favor of the employers. Accompanying the paragraph was a
cartoon presenting the same charge in a graphic form.</p>
<p>Upon the basis of this cartoon and paragraph, William Rand, an
attorney for the Associated Press, brought John Doe proceedings against
<em>THE MASSES</em> in the Municipal Court of New York. Justice Breen
dismissed the case.</p>

<p>Rand then went to the District Attorney. And the District Attorney
considered the case serious enough to receive the attention of the
Grand Jury. He secured an indictment of two editors of <em>THE MASSES</em>
for criminal libel. Max Eastman and Arthur Young were arraigned on
December 13, pleaded not guilty, and were each released on $1,000 bail.
The date for the trial is not set. The penalty for criminal libel may
be one year in prison, $5,000 fine, or both.</p>
<p>We do not invite your solicitude over the fate of these two editors
of THE MASSES. But we do invite you to arouse yourselves against any
attempt to put down by force of legal procedure the few free and
independent critics of the Associated Press. The hope of democratic
civilization lies in the dissemination of true knowledge, and every man
must be free to keep vigilance over the sources of knowledge. The
Associated Press boasts of supplying news to one-half the population of
this country. And if that boast is true, or if it remotely approximates
the truth, then a criticism of the Associated Press is a criticism of
the very heart of the hope of progress for mankind in America. And if
the Associated Press proves powerful enough&#8212;as it may, for it is the
biggest political force we have&#8212;to silence such criticism, we may as
well forget all about the New Haven Railroad, and the Telephone Trust,
and the Standard Oil Trust, and the Steel Trust, and the Money Trust,
and every other problem of combination that confronts us, for they are
little or nothing by comparison with a sovereign control of true
knowledge.</p>
<p>In our effort to secure a just decision of this case and the
principles involved in it, we expect the support of every man and woman
who believes in democratic civilization and the freedom of the press.</p>
<p>If you control or influence any avenue of publicity in the country,
go out and help us get the case before the public. And if you know any
other way to contribute to a legal struggle, do not pause or postpone
it. The issue is not ours, it is yours.</p>
<p>The defense is in the hands of Gilbert E. Roe, 55 Liberty street,
New York, a former law partner of Senator La Follette and a
distinguished fighter against Privilege.</p>
<p>FLOYD DELL</p>
<p>&#8212;January 1914</p>

<h4>THE ASSOCIATED PRESS</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p>We print below a defense of the Associated Press which appeared in
the <em>New York Times</em> of March 7, and a reply to that editorial
by Mr. Amos Pinchot. This reply was sent to the <em>Times,</em> but
was not printed there. It appeared later in the columns of the <em>New
York Sun</em>. We offer our readers the choice between the two views of
the Associated Press and its activities.</p>
<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The <em>Times</em> Editorial</h4>

<br>
<br>
<p>The men who centuries ago fought and won the great fight for freedom
of speech and of the press were stout and worthy champions of the
liberties of the people. Nowadays those who bawl loudest for freedom of
speech are persons who make or wish to make the unworthiest use of the
privilege. When men or women inciting mobs to riot and pillage come
into collision with the police we always hear much prating about
freedom of speech.</p>
<p>The freedom of speech and of the press found defenders of the &#8220;free
press protest meeting&#8221; held in Cooper Union Thursday evening, under the
management of the Liberal Club. Mr. Lincoln Steffens was there and
spoke. There were feminists and suffragists. But Mr. Amos E. Pinchot
was the star of the evening. The meeting was called as a measure of
protest against the Federal indictment for criminal libel that has been
found against Max Eastman and Art Young, the editor and the cartoonist
of a Socialist publication, <em>THE MASSES.</em> These men published
in their paper a cartoon representing Mr. Frank B. Noyes, President of
The Associated Press, as poisoning the waters of public opinion by
causing to be sent out false and distorted news to the newspapers
served by that organization. This cartoon was examined by a Federal
Grand Jury, adjudged to be libelous, and an indictment for criminal
libel was brought. Mr. Amos E. Pinchot insisted that a protest should
be made against the use of the Federal District Attorney&#8217;s office for
the muzzling of those who criticised The Associated Press monopoly. In
a matter of criminal libel the office of the public prosecutor can be
"used&#8221; only when the prosecutor finds a case for submission to the
Grand Jury, and the Grand Jury in its finding represents not the
prosecutor but the people. Mr. Pinchot should understand that this is
not an Associated Press suit; it is a Government suit, an action
brought by the people to punish the lawless.</p>
<p>The speakers at the Cooper Union meeting, and others besides, insist
that there should be an investigation of The Associated Press. The
indictment of Eastman and Young makes certain that an investigation
will be had, a thorough, searching, and perfectly impartial
investigation. The Socialists who perpetrated the libel will have every
opportunity in the world to show that Mr. Noyes does in fact poison the
news, mislead the public, and pervert its notions of current affairs.
If The Associated Press has guilty secrets they will get full
publicity. What more can be asked by the volunteer defenders of the
press against an odious monopoly? The surface appearance of the
transaction is that The Associated Press has courted an investigation
of the most far-reaching kind.</p>
<p>Mr. Pinchot is a careless man. He made this statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had a long acquaintance with The Associated Press. I am
perfectly willing to stand behind the charge made by Eastman and Young
that The Associated Press does color and distort the news, that it is
not impartial, and that it is a monopolistic corporation, not only in
constraint of news but in constraint of truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not necessary to say that Mr. Pinchot does not know what he is
talking about and to apply unpleasant epithets to him and to his
utterance. He is confuted and made ridiculous by the facts of the case.
The condition he describes is impossible, it could not arise and
continue in The Associated Press. This is made clear by an admirable
statement of the matter which we take from the editorial columns of The
Springfield Republican. Referring to the charge that The Associated
Press has power to color the news, and so determine &#8220;in what form and
to what extent the news of the world shall be given from day to day to
the average citizen,&#8221; The Republican says:</p>

<p>&#8220;But The Republican knows from actual experience and from many
years&#8217; study of the daily press of the United States that the worst
abuses of news publication are perpetrated by the reporters of
individual newspapers in their local field or by the special
correspondents directly serving them at a distance. The more papers a
reporter or a correspondent serves&#8212;papers with interests and
sympathies far from uniform&#8212;the closer he approximates usually to
impartial presentation of facts. And that is precisely the position of
the news-gathering representatives of The Associated Press.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anybody but a Socialist champion of freedom of the press would find
this statement convincing. All sorts of newspapers are served by The
Associated Press&#8212;Republican, Democratic, Bull Moose, Independent,
pro-Bryan, anti-Bryan, some that insist that the corporations are too
much abused, and others insisting that they are not abused enough&#8212;in
short, newspapers representing every shade of opinion. Now, if Mr.
Noyes should attempt to use his dyestuffs on the news served to all
these papers there would be a deafening uproar and tumult all over the
country. The Associated Press would be split into fragments and the
views openly expressed of its management would make the cartoon of <em>THE
MASSES</em> look like an expression of confidence and esteem. If there
were a church press association and the management should serve purely
Methodist news or Dutch Reformed news to the subscribers, the case
would be an exact parallel to that alleged by <em>THE MASSES</em> and
declared by Mr. Pinchot on knowledge to exist. Mr. Pinchot has no such
knowledge. He bears false witness and foolishly butts his head against
a rough stone wall. If the assailants of The Associated Press would now
and then find something true to say about it, if they would base their
arguments on some other structure than one built up of glaring
falsehoods and owlish stupidities, their antics would be more
interesting.</p>
<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>
<h4>MR. PINCHOT&#8217;S REPLY</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p>To the Editor of the Sun&#8212;Sir: The subjoined letter in reply to an
editorial article in defense of the Associated Press and in
condemnation of its critics was sent to the <em>New York Times</em> on
March 7, but has not been made public by that newspaper:</p>

<p><br>
To-day&#8217;s <em>Times</em> publishes an editorial over a column long
defending the Associated Press as to the indictments against the
editors of THE MASSES and attacking myself and others who &#8220;insist that
there should be an investigation of the Associated Press.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <em>Times</em> says that the Associated Press could not
possibly color the news, because it serves all kinds of
newspapers&#8212;"Republican, Democratic, Bull Moose, Independent, etc."&#8212;so
that if it was not impartial &#8220;there would be a deafening uproar and
tumult all over the country.&#8221; I do not think that this is either an
impressive argument or a fair statement of the case.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact there has been a tumult of protest against
Associated Press news coloring throughout the country. And with this
protest newspaper owners who are members of the Associated Press and
dependent upon it for their information are in many instances heartily
sympathetic. Within the last month I have talked with a number of
editors of newspapers that are members of the Associated Press. They
assured me that the charges of suppression and misrepresentation made
by <em>THE MASSES</em> are well within the truth. They, each of them,
expressed the sincere hope that there would be a searching
investigation which would result in a change of policy.</p>
<p>These gentlemen, however, are not free to state their opinion of the
Associated Press openly, either in their papers or otherwise. For,
under the bylaws of the Associated Press, they would at once be subject
to fines or other discipline. Moreover, Section I of Article II
provides that the corporation shall have the right to expel a member
"for any conduct on his part, or on the part of any one in his employ
or connected with his newspaper, which in its absolute discretion it
shall deem of such a character as to be prejudicial to the interest and
welfare of the corporation and its members, or to justify such
expulsion. The action of the members of the corporation in such regard
shall be final and there shall be no right of appeal or review of such
action.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Sun to-day reprints an editorial from the <em>Peoria Star,</em>
which describes how membership in the Associated Press is restricted.
It says: &#8220;Membership is restricted in each city, and no new member can
be taken in except by consent of every member in the city belonging to
the trust. In some places membership is held at an exorbitant figure
running up into hundreds of thousands of dollars. * * * It can readily
be seen that this is the worst possible monopoly, because the
newspapers belonging to it are obliged to print what the management
desires, and they are prohibited from criticising any of its acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>When, in addition to this, we note that the ultimate control of the
Associated Press does not lie in the vote of the newspapers belonging
to it but in its bond ownership we realize that partiality and news
coloring can be indulged in by the Associated Press, even though, as
the <em>Times</em> says, all sorts of newspapers are served by it.</p>
<p>No newspaper can itself gather all its news. It must depend on some
news agency for its information. The Associated Press is the only great
news-providing agency that serves morning newspapers. To the morning
newspapers it is more important than the railroads are to industrial
organizations. For, while railroads merely transport the product of
industry, the Associated Press both gathers and transports the material
of which newspapers are made.</p>
<p>The Associated Press is certainly a monopoly. It is a monopoly
controlling the distribution of a vital necessity of civilization,
controlling the price at which this necessity shall be sold; and it
goes still further than other trusts in monopolistic power, for it
exercises an absolute discrimination as to whom its products shall be
sold to.</p>
<p>The <em>Times</em> editorial, in denouncing those who hold that the
District Attorney&#8217;s office shall not be used by the Associated Press,
seems to me to be inclined to cover up the real issue. It does not
mention that two criminal indictments were brought against Eastman and
Young for publishing the same editorial and cartoon.</p>

<p>In the first indictment the figure depicted as poisoning the
reservoir of public news and labelled &#8220;The Associated Press&#8221; is alleged
to refer, as in fact it was meant to refer, to the Associated Press, a
corporation. In a trial under such an indictment there would naturally
be admitted the broadest evidence upon the questions whether the
Associated Press colors news and exercises a monopolistic control over
the distribution of information to the public. In a trial upon such an
indictment a searching investigation into the policy and organization
of the Associated Press, its attitude toward labor and capital, its
control by bond ownership, etc., would be inevitable.</p>
<p>But it seems that the Associated Press is unwilling to appear in
court as a complainant in such a trial. For, just thirty-three days
after Eastman and Young were indicted and admitted to $1,000 bail each,
Mr. Noyes again complained to the District Attorney, and they were
again indicted. This time, however, the figure in the cartoon  labeled &#8220;The
Associated Press&#8221; is alleged to be a picture of Mr. Noyes, and the
charge in this indictment is not that the Associated Press is libelled,
but that Mr. Noyes personally is libelled. The Assistant District
Attorney in charge of the case now expresses his intention of
dismissing the first indictment, and only trying Eastman and Young on
the second. He contends that upon the trial of the second indictment
evidence in regard to suppression and coloring of news by the
Associated Press shall be inadmissible, and the trial shall be limited
to the narrow question as to whether Mr. Noyes and the dignity of the
people the of the County of New York were injured by the publication of
this cartoon.</p>
<p>It would seem as if this was an unfortunate change of ground,
because it is much more important for the public to discover whether
the Associated Press is guilty of news coloring and monopolistic
practices than whether Mr. Noyes and the public have been harmed by the
publication of Art Young&#8217;s picture.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that all this agitation, the indictments of Eastman
and Young, the mass meeting of protest, the discussions and
recriminations in the papers and, finally, the approaching trial in the
criminal courts, will have some beneficial and constructive outcome. It
is perfectly clear to those who have thought of the question calmly
that this outcome must inevitably be along legislative lines. The
nature of the Associated Press, its control over the distribution of
news and the size and scope of its operations demand that it shall be
considered a common carrier in the sense that rail roads are common
carriers. Its service must be open to all those who can pay for it, its
control known and all of its operations conducted with the fullest
publicity.</p>
<p>The initial and necessary step in this programme is an investigation
which will go deeply into very important questions involved. Many
people have hoped that in the trial of Eastman and Young such an
investigation could be secured.</p>
<p>I hope that in spite of the by-laws of the Associated Press, which I
realize would, under ordinary circumstances, prohibit your publishing
what I have written, you may decide that the present situation would
justify you in doing so.</p>
<p>AMOS PINCHOT.</p>
