<p class="fst"><b>ANDREW GLYN exposes Tory lies about the cost of producing coal
on the basis of the NCB&#8217;s own accounts (in table below). Below that he
indicates some of the costs of the strike which the government
conceals.</b></p>

			<p class="smc"><b>Accounting for subsidies</b></p>

			<p class="sm1">AS PART of its propaganda campaign against the NUM, the
			government has quoted huge figures for the amount of &#8216;subsidy&#8217;
			it pays to the coal industry. Peter Walker, the Energy Secretary,
			said that the taxpayer contributed &#163;1.3 billion last year, or
			nearly &#163;130 per week for each miner.</p>

			<p class="sm">If the NCB really is &#8220;insolvent&#8221;, as he alleged, it is not
			surprising to hear Chancellor of the Exchequer Lawson claiming
			that the cost of the industry <i>not</i>
			working during the strike is &#8220;only&#8221; &#163;300&#8211;&#163;400 million.</p>

			<p class="sm">In fact both these figures are entirely misleading. The NCB is
			not bankrupt and the cost of the strike is many time greater than
			the government admits.</p>

			<p class="sm">The government &#8220;subsidy&#8221; for 1983 covered the NCB&#8217;s
			operating losses (&#163;385 million), its interest payments (&#163;467
			million) and around &#163;500 million of &#8220;social costs&#8221;. The
			accounts for 1983&#8211;84 allow each of these items to be considered in turn.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td >
			<p class="smc"><b>&#8216;Operating losses&#8217;</b></p>

			<p class="sm1">&#8220;Operating losses&#8221; sounds as though it means the excess of
			the costs of producing coal over the NCB&#8217;s revenue from sales.
			Yet included here are a number of items which are not costs of
			production at all.</p>

			<p class="sm">The biggest of these is &#163;245 of provision for payments of
			&#8220;surface damage&#8221;, the costs of meeting claims for subsidence
			in mining areas. The near doubling of this item in 1983/84
			reflects a rush of claims in the Mansfield area. But it does not
			reflect the estimated costs arising from this year&#8217;s mining;
			rather it is the historical legacy of past coal mining operations.</p>

			<p class="sm">Another major item is &#163;130 million of pensions and other
			payments to retired miners. In no sense can a pension paid to a
			retired miner, or compensation to people whose houses suffer
			subsidence damage, be regarded as costs of getting out coal now.
			Certainly they have to be paid but there is no reason why they
			should be met (via higher prices or worse wages) by those who now
			use coal or produce it. It is perfectly fair for the taxpayer (via
			government grants) to cover these payments; in no sense does this
			make them a subsidy to the production of coal.</p>

			<p class="sm"><i>These two items more than account for the NCB&#8217;s operating
			loss. If they are left out then the NCB made an operating profit
			in 1983/84. And, but for the &#163;200 million or so effect of the
			strike and the overtime ban, the NCB would even have financed
			practically all of its &#163;698 million investment programme out of
			its own revenue.</i></p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td >
			<p class="smc"><b>&#8220;Social costs&#8221;</b></p>

			<p class="sm1">&#8220;Social costs&#8221; is the next chunk of &#8220;subsidy&#8221;. These
			are &#8220;costs in respect of the closure of uneconomic capacity or
			redundancy of employees which are wholly or partially met by
			government grants&#8221;.</p>

			<p class="sm">Again, they are not a cost of producing this year&#8217;s coal;
			indeed, they are a cost of not producing coal! The costs of
			maintaining workers who are put out of work by pit closures make
			up part of the economic argument for not closing pits in the first
			place (see my article in <b>Militant</b>, no.&nbsp;705). They do
			not, as the NCB&#8217;s accounting suggests, represent an additional
			charge making the existing pits less economic, thus seeming to
			justify more closures.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td >
			<p class="smc"><b>Interest payments</b></p>

			<p class="sm1">Interest payments is the final item which has to be
			&#8220;subsidised&#8221; by the government. This represents &#163;467 million
			(&#163;400 million of which goes straight back to the government).</p>

			<p class="sm">This huge figure directly reflects both the high interest rate
			policy of the government and the fact that so much of the NCB&#8217;s
			investment has been financed by fixed interest loans. It actually
			represents a return of 6.3% on the NCB&#8217;s capital employed. This
			is nearly double the corresponding rate of profit in private
			manufacturing industry in recent years. So this part of the
			&#8220;subsidy&#8221; is mainly paid by the government itself. It gives
			itself an inflated rate of profit and the NCB an inflated loss.</p>

<h4 class="western">Extra costs of Tory attack</h4>

<p class="fst">This analysis (above) shows that production of last year did not
require <i>any</i> government subsidy at all. The value of coal
produced, some &#163;4,150 million, more than paid the miners and for the
cost of the inputs actually used in coal production.</p>

<p>It is the loss of coal production, put by the NCB at some 1.7
million tonnes per week, worth some &#163;73 million, which is the
biggest cost of the strike. This is not the end of the story, for the
reduction in the take home pay of miners, and those in industries
supplying inputs into mining must amount to some &#163;20 million per week.</p>

<p>Their reduced spending must lead to reduced production in
industries making the consumer goods they would otherwise be buying.
In addition the NCB is forced to postpone part of its investment
programme (which was running at &#163;14 million per week) which again
means a fall in the output of the construction industry and others
involved. So leaving aside any effects on the production of steel,
from fuel and ore shortages, it is likely that the total cost of the
strike in terms of lost production is running at around &#163;100 million
per week.</p>

<p>Finally the CEGB is using more expensive oil in its power
stations, reckoned by stockbrokers Simon and Coates to be costing an
additional &#163;18 million per week as compared with using coal. This
cost too will eventually have to be borne, probably by electricity
users in higher prices, and this must be added to the loss in
production to reach the total cost. This total must be well over &#163;100
million per week, and probably as much as &#163;120 million.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Chancellor cooks the books</h4>

<p class="fst">Considering all this how can Lawson possibly come up with a figure
of &#163;20 million per week as the cost of the strike?</p>

<p>First of all he is concerned only with the cost to the government
(NCB and other nationalised industry losses, lost tax revenue from
miners, social security and costs of policing).</p>

<p>It is not surprising that he does not bother to count the cost of
the strike to miners and other workers, preferring not to see the
miners as part of society at all. But still his figure is only
one-third of that suggested by Simon and Coates.</p>

<p>Their explanation is that he has not counted the cost of running
down coal stocks as a cost at all. His &#8216;cash flow&#8217; estimate of
the government&#8217;s real costs is no real guide to the true cost of
the government, let alone to the real cost to the country which is at
least five times his figure.</p>

<p>The government has been cooking the books on the balance of
payments as well. Whilst Tebbit told the House of Commons that the
effect of the strike was &#8220;minimal&#8221;, Simon and Coates reckon the
extra coal and oil imports as &#8220;at least &#163;237 million per month,
without making any allowance for higher imports in other industries
such as steel. There appears no way that these estimates can be
squared with the government&#8217;s own indications of the strike&#8217;s losses&#8221;.</p>

<p>The government likes to pretend that the costs of the strike are a
modest investment required to reorganise an insolvent industry. In
fact it is imposing massive costs in lost production and higher
priced oil. These average out at around &#163;2 per week for each person
in the country. Even looked at in narrow financial terms workers are
paying an enormous cost for the government&#8217;s attempt to smash the
NUM.</p>
