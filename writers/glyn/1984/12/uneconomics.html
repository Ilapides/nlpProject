<p class="fst"><strong>A recent report by leading accountants which backed the NUM&#8217;s
arguments that the government&#8217;s calculations of the cost of pit
closures vastly underestimates the effect of redundancy pay, dole and
lost tax was banned from the pages of the <em>Accountancy</em> magazine
and severely embarrassed the government. Ironically one of its main
authors is Price Waterhouse professor of accountancy at UMIST. ANDREW
GLYN, a leading figures in this debate, returns to the attack:</strong></p>
<p class="fst">OPERATING LOSSES certainly do not in themselves justify closure.
They do imply that the value of the coal produced is less than the
various costs attributed to the pit. But to conclude that the pits
should be closed presupposes that the resources which those costs
represent would have been used elsewhere to produce something of
greater value.</p>
<p>If on the contrary, those resources (both workers and equipment)
would otherwise be idle, there is no real cost to society from their
use in producing coal. Society as a whole gains the value of the
coal. The miners gain the difference between their take-home pay at
work and what they would receive if unemployed. If the value of the
coal they produce exceeds what they gain then the rest of society
benefits as well (since costs of closure exceed operating
subsidies).<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Closure costs</h4>
<p class="fst">Four pits, whose scheduled closure by the NCB precipitated the
strike, illustrate the case (the fifth was not producing during the
relevant period). Costs of closure can be estimated from the figures
for employment, costs and profits in the pits in 1983 prior to the
overtime ban (supplied to the NUM by the NCB). Assumptions can be
made about the costs to the government of the unemployment generated
amongst miners, other NCB employees, workers in supplying industries
and in industries affected by reduced spending.</p>

<p class="smc"><em>Note: The reason that the estimates of costs of closure in column (1) vary between pits<br/>

<p class="fst">They show that even Snowdown pit, burdened at the time with
development work which gave it the lowest sales revenue per miner of
all the NCB pits (£103 per week) would cost the government more to
close than to keep open. For the other &#8216;uneconomic&#8217; pits the net
costs of closure are even greater, often much greater.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Economic</h4>
<p class="fst">On this basis, not only are <em>all</em> the NCB&#8217;s pits &#8216;economic&#8217;
in the sense of making a contribution to production. They are all
actually so &#8216;economic&#8217; that keeping them open benefits the rest
of society as well as the workers involved.</p>
<p>The broad conclusion is strengthened by alternative (unfavourable)
estimates about the cost of unemployment etc. The two crucial
assumptions which <em>are</em> required are that closure would lead to
long-term unemployment, and that the output produced by the higher
cost pits does in fact have a substantial value (as the NCB accounts
themselves assume).</p>
<p>If the unemployment effect of closure was temporary, then the
losses of coal output would soon be offset by traditional output in
the industries where new jobs are created. Equally if the coal was
really worth no more dug out of the ground than left in the pit
(because there was no prospective use) then keeping the pits open
would simply be a way of subsidising incomes of those involved
(requiring a different justification).</p>
<p>For the unemployment effect to be temporary, it is not enough for
those whose jobs are immediately lost by closure to find jobs
elsewhere (by transferring to nearby pits for example). If no
<em>additional</em> jobs are created such moves must be at the expense
of other workers who would otherwise have filled the vacancies. The
decisive question is what happens to total employment, not the fate
of particular individuals.</p>
<p>The only argument advanced for the idea that making workers
unemployed will of itself generate substitute jobs is the theory that
the increase in unemployment will drive down real wages and thereby
(somehow) increase employment. But the persistence of mass
unemployment discredits this theory. So it is wholly implausible that
pit closure will lead to increased production elsewhere to compensate
for less coal produced.</p>
<p>But is the coal from the &#8216;marginal&#8217; pits really worth
anything, given the piling up of coal stocks in recent years? This
stockbuilding, however, just like rising unemployment, reflects the
government-induced contraction in the economy. If growth after 1979
had continued even at the slow rate achieved after the first &#8216;oil
shock&#8217;, then production in 1984 would have been some 7% higher and
coal use correspondingly increased.</p>
<p>Coal stocks in October last year before the overtime ban would
have been under 30 million tonnes, less than before the disputes of
1971 and 1973. So there is no shortage of valuable uses to which the
coal from the higher cost pits would be put, just as there is no
shortage of valuable jobs which the unemployed could do.</p>
<p>Labelling these pits as &#8216;uneconomic&#8217; and casting them out of
the NCB&#8217;s accounts is just the same trick as redefining registered
unemployment to reduce reported numbers out of work. Neither can
disguise the damage that is being done to the economy by government policies.</p>
