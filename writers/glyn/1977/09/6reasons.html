<br />
<p class="fst"><i>North Sea Oil has come to be like Britain&#8217;s El Dorado: a
province of abundant wealth holding out the promise of golden
salvation &#8211; but unfortunately entirely mythical.</i></p>

<p>It is argued, both on the right and left of the labour movement,
that North Sea Oil will provide the means of solving Britain&#8217;s
economic crisis.</p>

<p>Jim Callaghan, for instance, speaking recently in Cardiff, said
that &#8220;Thanks to a combination of factors, including the great bonus
of our own oil, Britain is about to enter a decade of opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the hard-headed representatives of big business, having
overcome their initial enthusiasm at the unexpected field of profits
opened up in the North Sea, are now taking a more realistic view.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;While North Sea oil,&#8221; comments the <b>Financial
Times</b> (8.9.77), &#8220;is a fairly unambiguous benefit &#8211; one need
only imagine our present condition without it to see this &#8211; it does
leave most of our fundamental problems largely untouched.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In other words, North Sea oil is a bonus without which British
capitalism would be in an even worse position than it is. But against
this &#8220;optimistic&#8221; view, other capitalist economists, notably
Wynne Godley of the Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge, are
now arguing (as we shall see) that North Sea oil will actually have
an overall adverse effect on the British economy.</p>

<p>From the beginning, however, this paper has pointed out that a
strategy for economic recovery based on the benefits of North Sea oil
must be illusory.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Marginal</h4>

<p class="fst">Production of oil from the North Sea is now about 13m tons, or a
seventh of Britain&#8217;s present requirements. By 1980 it is estimated
that this will rise to between 95m and 115m tons, more than enough to
meet total home demand. It would be the equivalent of about 10% of
current exports on 2&#189;% of Gross National Product.</p>

<p>While certainly easing Britain&#8217;s balance of payments problem,
the oil will have a marginal effect on other problems. Here we will
simply summarise six main reasons why the oil will not rescue British
capitalism from continued, catastrophic decline.</p>

<ol>
<li>The improvement from North Sea oil will hardly be any
greater than the effect of the balance of payments that has already
come from North Sea gas. The balance of payments would now be much
worse without gas, but the benefits from gas have not led to any
improvement in the performance of British industry.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>North Sea oil will do no more than offset the impact on the
balance of payments of the quadrupling of the price of OPEC oil in
1973. Only somebody who argues that there was no crisis in the
British economy before 1973, and that all the problems stem from
OPEC price rises can consistently argue that North Sea oil will
solve the crisis now.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>In fact, overall, North Sea oil will not even fully offset
the rise in oil costs since 1973. This is because the offshore oil
has been developed by foreign, mainly US, oil companies using
largely imported machinery. This machinery will have to be paid for,
and the US companies will send home a large proportion of their
profits. As a result, North Sea oil will cost more in foreign
exchange in 1980 than OPEC oil cost in 1973.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Apart from repatriated profits and payments for equipment,
a further chunk of North Sea oil revenues will be required to pay
off the foreign debts built up in the last four years in a desperate
attempt to prevent the complete breakdown of the economy. According
to the Governor of the Bank of England, some $20 billion falls due
by 1985.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The profits resulting from North Sea oil will be very big:
around &#163;2&#189; billion in 1980, or 1&#189;% of Gross Domestic Product.
This compares with company profits at the moment of &#163;9 billion. If
all the North Sea oil profits were invested in British industry &#8211;
something implied by those who argue that the oil will benefit the
rest of industry &#8211; that would go over half way towards doubling
manufacturing investment.<br/>
<br/>
But there is no likelihood of
this happening. Nearly two-thirds of these profits will go abroad to
foreign oil companies which took the biggest share of the licences.
They will have no reason to invest these profits back into British
industry with its low level of profits. Nor is there any guarantee
that British firms making profits from the North Sea will invest
their profits here. The big monopolies, whether British or American,
will invest wherever they find it most profitable.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Tax gains from North Sea oil profits will be very small. It
is estimated that in 1980 taxes from the oil (even including about
&#163;300m revenue from the British National Oil Corporation) will be
less than 10% of current revenue.<br/>
<br/>
Although <b>Labour&#8217;s
Manifesto</b> promised &#8220;full government participation with
majority public participation&#8221;, under pressure from the oil
monopolies the government retreated even on its taxation proposals.
The Petroleum Revenue Tax is set at the comparatively moderate rate
of 45% and is not charged at all if it would drive profits from a
particular oil field below 30%!<br/>
<br/>
The recent &#8220;participation
agreements&#8221; do little more than guarantee British access to North
Sea oil, at market prices, in case of emergency. Thus while the oil
companies are going to be able to reap super profits, the BNOC will
get only about a tenth of the profits from North Sea oil in the
early 1980s.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h4>Pessimism</h4>

<p class="fst">In addition to these points, however, a number of economists have
now come to the conclusion that the improvement in the balance of
payments resulting from North Sea oil will not at all be an unmixed
blessing for British capitalism. They fear that the consequent
strengthening of the pound will lead to an overvaluation of sterling
internationally which will actually further undermine the
competitiveness of British exports and, far from giving a boost to
British manufacturing industry, will actually accentuate its decline.</p>

<p>This view has recently been put forward by Wynne Godley of Cambridge:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Foreign earnings from North Sea oil could result in a
failure of the external value of sterling to fall sufficiently ...
Domestic unemployment, on extremely plausible assumptions would reach
3m by 1985 ... Industrial profits would be eroded, and our industry
become derelict ...&#8221; (<b>Financial Times</b>, 8.9.77)</p>

<p class="fst">It is surely clear from all these points that, in any case, if
North Sea oil is to make any real contribution to the recovery of the
British economy, its development and production must be taken out of
the hands of the big oil companies and be placed under public control
through nationalisation under workers&#8217; control and management.</p>

<p>But the fundamental point here is that North Sea oil, even in the
short run, can be no substitute for socialist measures to tackle the
crisis created by British capitalism.</p>
