<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<br />
<p class="fst"><em>The disastrous [policies] of Labour&#8217;s right wing have been completely
rejected by the great majority of Labour Party members and active
trade unionists.</em></p>

<p><em>The attempts of the right-wing &#8216;Solidarity&#8217; spokesmen to
justify the record of the last Labour government, claiming that it
implemented most of its manifesto policies, cut no ice with Labour&#8217;s
ranks.</em></p>

<p>Amazingly, Denis Healey himself, interviewed recently in <strong>New
Socialist</strong>, says he now supports an expansion of demand, increased
public spending, &#8220;new public enterprise and a strengthened NEB&#8221;,
&#8220;reshaped&#8221; financial institutions to provide cheap long term
credit, selective import controls and a massive expansion of
industrial training.</p>

<p>All these are elements of the Alternative Economic Strategy (AES),
originally put forward as an alternative to Healey&#8217;s monetarist
policies during the 1974&#8211;79 government. The Party has moved left
and, it seems, Healey has moved left with it.</p>

<p>The main components of the AES are now restated in the NEC&#8217;s
conference document, <em>The Socialist Alternative</em>. The
overwhelming majority of the Party supports the reforms proposed,
reforms which would be an enormous step forward for the working class
&#8211; if they could be implemented.</p>

<p>Does Labour&#8217;s economic programme really present a <em>socialist
alternative</em> to monetarism? As the NEC&#8217;s new document
(<em>Statements to conference</em>, pp.&nbsp;1&#8211;33) quite rightly says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Our whole economic strategy should be the discussion
and debate in the labour movement. Unless our policies are widely
understood and supported both within and outside the party, we cannot
hope to carry through the radical transformation they entail ...</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The crisis we shall inherit cannot be met by cautious
tinkering or piecemeal measures. It demands an imaginative and
sweeping programme, based on coherent strategy and guided by
socialist values.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The statement begins with a vivid and well-argued account of the
effects of Thatcher&#8217;s policies. Scorn is poured on the theoretical
pretensions of monetarism: &#8220;Milton Friedman&#8217;s equations have had
a more devastating effect on British industry than Hitler&#8217;s bombs.&#8221;</p>

<p>It points out the absurdity of policies costing &#163;18 billion a
year in lost output (a less conservative estimate would be more than
double that figure).</p>

<p>Moreover, in contrast to some previous denunciations of it as
absurd and &#8220;outdated&#8221;, the political purpose of monetarism, an
all-out attack on the labour movement, is clearly recognised:
&#8220;Unemployment is not an accidental side-effect &#8211; it is the
central weapon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The document boldly says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Just as the government demobilised three million
servicemen and women returning from the war, so the next Labour
government must demobilise the three million who have been
conscripted onto the reserve army of the unemployed.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">It knocks on the head the idea that we cannot afford more public
spending to provide jobs.</p>

<p>But it also admits that in the past the hostility of the
capitalist class, expressed in a &#8220;fall in business confidence and
the flight of capital has created an atmosphere of crisis in which
Labour governments have been forced to abandon their social
priorities in favour of economic orthodoxy ... we must be prepared to
counter this disruption when it occurs.&#8221;</p>

<p>But how? The NEC calls for exchange controls and the &#8220;monitoring&#8221;
of foreign investment; but even preventing the outflow of capital
does not mean the controllers of finance will lend to the government
to finance an expansion.</p>

<p>A &#8220;strike of finance&#8221; is in their power. How can what the
document calls their &#8220;unwarranted degree of control&#8221; be ended?</p>

<p>The answer must be nationalisation of the major banks, insurance
companies and other financial institutions. But unfortunately this
vital component of any socialist programme is now dropped from
Labour&#8217;s plans.</p>

<p>All we have in its place is the news (p.&nbsp;17) that &#8220;we are
looking at the possibilities for orderly sales of debt through
<em>agreements</em> (our emphasis) with lending institutions.&#8221;</p>

<p>This would be how the Labour government would finance the
increased public borrowing which the statement says would be
necessary &#8220;in the short run&#8221; to finance increased public
spending. The new arrangements would cut through the monetarist
mystifications now surrounding monetary targets and the PSBR (public
sector borrowing requirement) and reduce the &#8220;unwarranted degree of
control by the financial institutions&#8221;.</p>

<p>But what price would the Labour government have to pay for such
agreements? Surely it would be the abandonment of social priorities
in favour of economic orthodoxy ...</p>

<p>The NEC believes that the risk of retaliation to import controls
should be minimised by proceeding &#8220;through negotiation&#8221; with
trading partners. But negotiation implies something is offered in
return for closing markets to further import prevention. What has the
NEC in mind?</p>

<p>The NEC points out that expansion will help to curb inflation as
costs are reduced. It argues for price controls to &#8220;prevent
companies taking advantage of new economic conditions just to
increase profits.&#8221;</p>

<p>But providing a market is not simply a question of generating
demand at any old price. There is enough demand in the world from the
point of view of people&#8217;s needs to keep all Britain&#8217;s factories
blasting at full stretch, if only they could produce <em>profitably</em>.</p>

<p>Increasing profits will be necessary to induce the capitalists to
expand production in many of the worst hit industries. And even if a
system of price control would be cunningly juggled to make an overall
expansion worthwhile, what about increased investment, without which
any expansion will peter out?</p>

<p>There is now way that the capitalists would contemplate ploughing
back extra resources into their businesses in the absence of a
significant increase in the rate of profit &#8211; now standing at around
2% and only a fraction of the rate even of the mid-1960s.</p>

<p>The establishment of a &#8220;publicly owned stake in each important
sector of industry&#8221;, whether that is intended to mean a
nationalised company or some form of government holding, certainly
will not encourage the rest of the capitalist to invest. On the
contrary big business &#8211; and they will not have to read Labour&#8217;s
programme to understand this &#8211; will see it as a first stage to &#8220;the
common ownership of the means of production.&#8221;</p>

<p>They will show how they feel by refraining from investment, which
would be throwing good money after bad as far as they were concerned.
Nor will planning agreements with major firms in each sector succeed
in creating jobs and new investment unless this is profitable.</p>

<p>Indeed, the document seems to regard planning as a dialogue
between government, trade unions and business:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;While some big companies will make political
objections to Labour&#8217;s plans, they have good business reasons for
welcoming arrangements by which industrial realities can be fully
taken into account in government ...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">We have had plenty of experience in past Labour governments taking
into account &#8220;industrial realities&#8221;.</p>

<p>The problem raised in implementing socialist policies are not
unique to Britain. Proposals very similar to those in <em>The
Socialist Alternative</em> are currently being put into practice in France.</p>

<p>Already, important reforms, in terms of a higher minimum wage, a
shorter working week, better pensions have been brought in. The
government is proceeding with its plans to nationalise a number of
important industrial groups.</p>

<p>But already, only 100 days into office, the familiar attempt to
reassure the industrialists is in full swing. <strong>The Financial Times</strong>
reported (8 September 1981):</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The French government has embarked on a campaign to
soothe employers&#8217; fears over a socialist administration and to try
to urge industry to boost investment ... The prime minister ... sought
to reassure employers on two accounts.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;There was no question, he said, of interfering with
the decision-making powers of the heads of companies or imposing on
them a veto over dismissals. Trade unions have been claiming
consultative powers over both management and dismissals that have
frightened employers.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;He also said that is was necessary to halt the rise in
social security costs payable by industry ...</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;M Francois Ceyrac, head of the employers&#8217;
federation, queried last week some of the contradictions in the
government&#8217;s policy. How was it possible, he asked, both to woo
industry and to saddle it with new taxes, higher social security
charges, restrictions on employers&#8217; powers and now
nationalisation?&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The previous week the <strong>Financial Times</strong> reported that the
Minister for the Economy was resisting union demands for a freezing
of some consumer prices. The likelihood is of inflation of 18% this
year, and there is strong pressure to devalue against the D-Mark to
restore French competitiveness (i.e. profitability).</p>

<p>Despite the government&#8217;s expansionary programmes, growth is
expected to be only 3¼% next year, which would certainly not prevent
unemployment staying above the 2 million mark.</p>

<p>If Mitterand has these problems in implementing his programme,
despite his huge popular support and parliamentary majority, imagine
the situation faced by the next Labour government with a crisis even
more severe than in France.</p>

<p><strong>British Business</strong> (4 September 1981) reported that the rate
of profit was twice as high in France as in Britain according to the
most recent figures.</p>

<p>The NEC&#8217;s <em>Socialist Alternative</em> warns that it would be
dishonest to pretend that full employment could be quickly restored.</p>

<p>Yet the post-war experience to which they refer was that in two
years, between 1945 and 1947, 2&#189; million jobs were created outside
the armed forces, and unemployment in 1947 was less than 2% despite
the demobilisation. Investment rose from 5% to 16% of total
production, and consumption per head of the population rose by 13%,
as the burden of military expenditure was reduced.</p>

<p>A crucial difference between then and now, however, is that
profits were high in 1945 &#8211; 12% of domestic product. So the
employers were quite ready to raise production and boost investment.</p>

<p>With profits a fraction of that level, and their position
threatened by price controls, future nationalisation, etc. there is
no way the next Labour government could get the same response whilst
the economy remains dominated by private capital.</p>

<p>Yet just as rapid an expansion is needed now.</p>

<p>The document does state clearly that it believes that common
ownership should be substituted for private ownership of the means of
production. But this is said to be a &#8220;long-term goal&#8221;.</p>

<p>It cannot be relegated to the misty future in this way.</p>

<p>The NEC says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Transformation of the economy in a socialist direction
<em>is not</em> (our emphasis) to be postponed until we have achieved a
reconstruction of industry.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">But not even the reforms proposed in the document will be
implemented in a lasting way within the rotten framework of
capitalism. They could be achieved only through a fundamental
socialist transformation, not through &#8216;half-way&#8217; measures &#8220;in a
socialist direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>To give reality to the social improvements outlined, therefore,
the next Labour government must link them to a programme for the
nationalisation of the banks, finance houses, and the 200 or so big
monopolies which dominate the economy.</p>

<p>Nationalisation should not be with exorbitant compensation, as in
the past, but minimum compensation on the basis of proven need. If
the financiers and big investors are incapable of working and an
prove they are hard up, they could be paid decent social security
under a socialist government.</p>

<p>Nationalised industry should not be run by massive bureaucracies
composed of ex-owners, ex-private managers, retired civil servants
and super-annuated politicians, as they have been up until now.</p>

<p>Industry should be run under democratic workers&#8217; control and
management, under boards composed of a third from trade unions in the
industry, a third from the TUC, and a third from the government.</p>

<p>Then there could be a socialist plan of production. Under a plan,
there would be an enormous growth of production, science and
technique, creating the conditions for rapid cuts in the working day
and working year, and for immeasurable improvements in workers&#8217;
living standards.</p>

<p>Without a socialist plan, the irreversible decline of British
industry will continue, with untold suffering for working people.</p>

<p>Transformation of the economy cannot be postponed. But
transformation is possible only through the working class being
mobilised to implement through-going socialist measures.</p>
