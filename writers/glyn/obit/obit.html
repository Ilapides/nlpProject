<p class="fst">WITH GREAT sadness we report the death of Andrew Glyn, an internationally renowned socialist economist and a former supporter of the <strong>Militant,</strong> the Socialist Party&#8217;s precursor. Andrew died on 22 December, aged 64, only a few months after being diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer.</p>

<p>Over three decades, Andrew&#8217;s books, together with many articles, provided socialist activists with vital analysis and factual ammunition for the fight against contemporary capitalism. <strong>British Capitalism, Workers and the Profit Squeeze</strong> (written with Bob Sutcliffe in 1972) analysed the deep malaise of British capitalism at the end of the world post-war upswing and, at the same time, stirred up controversy among Marxists over the fundamental causes of capitalist crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Capitalism Since 1945</strong> (written with Phil Armstrong and the late John Harrison, 1984, second ed. 1991) quickly became an indispensable handbook for anyone seeking to understand the rise and fall of the post-war capitalist order, from Keynesianism to neo-liberalism.</p>

<p>Andrew was a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, for 38 years. He came from a wealthy banking family and went to Eton. But from his early years he rejected the inequality and privilege of the existing system, actively supporting workers&#8217; struggles and working for a socialist change of society. His research and writing was always focussed on issues that, in some way, would provide useful material for the labour movement.</p>

<p>During the 1970s and early 1980s, Andrew was an active supporter of the Militant, helping to build a strong group in Oxford. In 1978, Andrew wrote a Militant pamphlet, <strong>Capitalist Crisis or Socialist Plan</strong>, a critique of the &#8216;Alternative Economic Strategy&#8217; put forward by the Tribune group of left Labour MPs.</p>

<p>Andrew later left our ranks, while continuing to participate in many struggles, notably the 1984&#8211;85 miners&#8217; strike and the battle to defeat Thatcher&#8217;s poll tax. He was very willingly enlisted by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) as an expert advisor, and quickly researched and wrote <strong>The Economic Case Against Pit Closures</strong> (NUM, 1984), which exposed Thatcher&#8217;s energy policy as a politically motivated vendetta against the miners.</p>

<p>Later, Andrew elaborated on the devastating effects of the miners&#8217; defeat in clearing the way for the implementation of ultra-free-market (neo-liberal) policies by Thatcher and then New Labour. In 2006, he published an illuminating analysis of the system&#8217;s latest phase, <strong>Capitalism Unleashed</strong> (<a href="http://www.socialismtoday.org/105/capitalism.html" target="new">reviewed</a> in <strong>Socialism Today</strong>, No.&#160;105, November 2006). This latest book shows the links between accelerated globalisation and the international neo-liberal offensive against the working class. It also highlights the growing domination of finance capital, driven by the short-term drive for maximum profits.</p>

<p>Andrew spoke at a well-attended session on globalisation at the Socialist Party&#8217;s Socialism 2006 event.</p>

<p>Andrew&#8217;s enthusiasm for ideas was undiminished until the end. He would have made many more valuable contributions on the latest developments in capitalism, and they will be greatly missed.</p>

<p>Andrew&#8217;s work as an economist has been widely admired, even by many who do not share his socialist outlook. Yet he was a very modest person, with a great sense of humour and a generous gift for friendship. Conversations with Andrew were always immensely stimulating and a lot of fun. He loved jazz, playing the double bass and recently learning the piano. He should not have died so soon.</p>
