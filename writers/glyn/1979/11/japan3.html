<p class="fst"><i>For Japan&#8217;s Prime Minister Ohira, and his cronies in the
ruling [and mis-named] Liberal Democratic Party, this autumn seemed
the ideal time for a general election.</i></p>

<p><i>The Japanese economy, geared to investing for &#8216;high-speed
growth&#8217;, suffered a bigger decline than any other major capitalist
country in the 1974&#8211;75 recession. Rapid inflation, the end of the
&#8216;economic miracle&#8217; and a particularly damaging scandal cost the
LDP the absolute majority in the Diet [Parliament] in 1976, though
they have had few problems subsequently in getting the support of the
minor parties.</i></p>

<p>Since then an intensive export drive, together with Keynesian
policies of expansion by the government, have generated a modest
upswing with growth at 5&#8211;6% a year; inflation has eased from more
than 20% to around 3%.</p>

<p>What made this October especially suitable was that the relatively
favourable economic situation will not last. The recent fall in the
value of the Yen, together with oil price increases, have recently
pushed wholesale prices up to a rate of 10% a year; this will soon
show up in faster price rises in the shops.</p>

<p>Faced with a government deficit which has been running at about
4&#8211;5% of GNP, the big capitalists&#8217; have declared a virtual
&#8216;financing strike&#8217;, demanding that the deficit be cut to make way
for financing their own investment. Ohira himself favoured the
introduction of a consumption tax which would raise prices, and cut
workers&#8217; spending power by 3%.</p>

<p>The budget has been pruned to prevent real increases in spending.
Monetary policy has been tightened with interest rates pushed up by
the Bank of Japan. The prospects for export have deteriorated with
the slowdown, and possible fall, in world trade.</p>

<p>All this adds up to the prospect of a renewed bout of stagnation
in the Japanese economy; no wonder Ohira decided to strike while the
iron was hot.</p>

<p>In view of these relatively favourable circumstances, the fact
that the LDP actually lost a seat was labelled as a &#8216;catastrophe&#8217;
by the press. In fact overconfidence, and factional rivalry led to
the LDP standing more candidates in the multi-member constituencies,
so splitting the vote.</p>

<p>But even their 20% recovery in their share of the poll is less
impressive than it looks as much of it was gained at the expense of
the &#8216;independents&#8217;, who are mainly loyal LDP hacks who have been
disgraced in some scandal and who are tactfully left off the LDP ticket.</p>

<p>The press has blamed the failure of the LDP to improve their
position on Ohira&#8217;s gaffe early in the campaign when he more or
less admitted he would introduce the consumption tax. But in reality
such a tax would underline the fact that the recovery has been at the
expense of the working class.</p>

<p>Productivity has increased very sharply since 1975 &#8211; by 27%
between 1975 and 1978 in manufacturing industry as a whole; by 61% in
electrical engineering for example. This increase in productivity has
not been the result mainly of investment in new technology.</p>

<p>Capital accumulated is in fact only running at half the rate of
the boom years of the late sixties. Rather the Japanese capitalists,
especially in the major export industries and firms, have carried out
a savage process of rationalisation.</p>

<p>Between 1974 and 1978 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries cut employment
by nearly 12,000 (15%), Hitachi by 10,000 (12%), Toyota by 7,000
(20%), Toyo Spinning by 7,000 (30%). Taking all the manufacturing
firms employing more than 1,000 workers, the average cut in
employment was 10% between 1974 and 1977.</p>

<p>Older workers have been especially hit because they cost more &#8211;
in the big firms workers aged 50&#8211;55 are paid double the wages of
20&#8211;25 year olds. Unemployment amongst the older age groups has
doubled since 1973; young workers, because of their cheapness can
more easily get a job &#8211; for a time. More and more workers are taken
on a temporary rather than &#8216;regular&#8217; basis. They are paid as
little as a third of the regular rate.</p>

<p>Women workers, typically paid two-thirds of the male rate, have
been taken on in huge numbers. More and more male workers have been
forced to attempt to scratch a living by becoming self-employed,
particularly in the service industries, or by getting a worse paid
job in the small scale firms.</p>

<p>Japanese workers work long hours &#8211; an average of four hours a
week more than German workers (taking account of fewer holidays);
less than a quarter of them work a five day week. Their real wages
have risen by only 2&#8211;3% a year in the last few years, far slower than productivity.</p>

<p>A recent comparison of the purchasing power of wages in Japan put
them at about half those of the USA and under two-thirds of the rate
in Germany. Japanese workers are famous for their high savings &#8211;
the average workers&#8217; family saves around one-fifth of their income.</p>

<p>These have been savagely eroded by inflation. They are forced to
save so much for old age (pensions are around &#163;8 a week), for
education (a family with one child in primary school and another in
secondary school will be paying at least &#163;300 a year), for medical
expenses (most beds in the big university attached hospitals require
steep extra charges not covered by insurance and these can mount up
to several hundred pounds) and most importantly to try and buy a house.</p>

<p>Against this background the real question has to be, not why the
LDP did a bit better or a bit worse at this or that election, but,
how have they maintained their unbroken reign of more than 30 years?
The rural social basis of the LDP has been eroded by the massive wave
of industrialisation and urbanisation.</p>

<p>Between 1955 and 1975 the proportion of the rural population
living in rural areas fell from 40% to 12%, whilst the LDP&#8217;s share
of the vote declined from nearly 60% to less than 45%. The LDP keeps
this rural vote loyal by generous support to rice farmers, leaving
the industrial workers to buy rice at way over the market rate.</p>

<p>Moreover, the leverage of the rice subsidy is much greater than it
appears for many industrial workers commute from the countryside
whilst one member of the family tills the land; others leave the
country intending to return to the land at some later stage. Very few
farming families have sold their plots.</p>

<p>The election boundaries based on 1940s&#8217; population figures, also
hugely favour the LDP which gets many more seats than their share of
the votes justifies. In 1976 an LDP candidate was elected with 37,000
votes in a rural area whilst a Communist was defeated with 147,000
votes in an urban seat.</p>

<p class="fst">Bribing of the electorate is also carried out in quite blatant
ways. Although campaign spending is legally restricted to &#163;30,000 a
candidate nobody pays attention to the rules. The <b>Japan Times</b>
(August 11) reported that &#8220;an estimate currently circulating in LDP
quarters is that a Diet seat might cost as much as 200 million Yen&#8221; (&#163;400,000).</p>

<p>&#8220;A candidate with &#163;100,000 to spend won&#8217;t stand a chance.&#8221;
As well as being used for free meals and other benefits for
supporters, outright bribery is common. The <b>Financial Times</b>
reported that &#8220;It is an open secret that in one Tokyo suburban
constituency votes are &#8216;worth&#8217; about 5,000 Yen (&#163;10) apiece.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many constituencies are handed down from father to son like
&#8216;rotten boroughs&#8217; in Britain at the beginning of the last
century. At this election more than 100 LDP candidates were sons,
nephews etc. of former Diet members.</p>

<p>The politicians get the money from big business of course. The
methodical drafters of the election law have even imposed a means
test for the capitalist &#8211; there is a sliding scale of maximum
permitted donations increasing with the size of the firm and with a
maximum for the biggest firms of 150 million Yen (around &#163;100,000)!</p>

<p>But as one LDP official told the <b>Japan Times</b>: &#8220;We can
even solicit campaign funds from companies affiliated with the big
corporations as well as personal contributions from the business
bosses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes, of course, the payments require very specific services
to be rendered by the politicians concerned. Summarising the case of
former Prime Minister Tanaka, charged with taking a million pound
bribe to make sure that All Nippon Airways bought the Lockheed
Tri-Star the <b>Japan Times</b> said: &#8220;there seems to be little
dispute about the transfer of cash &#8211; prepared by Lockheed&#8217;s Japan
office, transported in a Marubeni car (the trading firm acting as
go-between), transferred to the trunk of a car driven by Tanaka&#8217;s
chauffeur (who committed suicide after giving details to the
prosecution), received by Tanaka&#8217;s secretary and placed in Tanaka&#8217;s
mansion&#8221; (August 11).</p>

<p>One Marubeni executive described how his boss came out of the
meeting with Tanaka and simply showed him the five fingers of his
hand, saying &#8216;this is it&#8217;!</p>

<p>The <b>Japan Times</b> reported:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Recent revelations concerning the Defence Agency&#8217;s
purchase of the F-4E fighter have suggested that 500 million Yen was
standard figure as a bribe for fixing a deal of this kind. It was the
same amount that Nissho-Awai (another trading company) had given
Raizo Matsuno, a former Minister of Defence, for presumably
facilitating the government purchases of the US-made military
aircraft.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h4 class="western">&#8216;Centre&#8217; Parties</h4>

<p class="fst">Tanaka but not Matsuno was a successful candidate in the election.
Neither stood as official LDP candidates, but as &#8220;Independents&#8221;
who, of course, co-operate 100% with the LDP. Tanaka, in fact, is
still the boss of one of the strongest LDP factions, and the power
behind Ohira.</p>

<p>Another argument for an October election was that further
revelations in the Tanaka trial might be even more embarrassing.</p>

<p>The ruling class also makes use of the &#8216;centre parties&#8217; to
maintain the LDP in power. Nearly half the voters live in the three
major urban areas around Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya. There the LDP gets
less than a third of the vote. While the right-wing candidates swept
the board in the April elections, this was the result of the LDP
supporting &#8216;moderate&#8217; candidates which were also backed by the
right-wing Democratic Socialists and the Komeito (the Buddhist &#8216;clean
government&#8217; party supported by a section of the petty bourgeois and
most oppressed layers of the population).</p>

<p>These parties have seen that, with the workers&#8217; parties
floundering, their best chance of sharing in the spoils of office is
to act as the urban prop of the LDP.</p>

<p>The leadership of the unions helps the ruling class immeasurably
in its task of ensuring the burdens of the economic crisis fall on
the workers.</p>

<p>Large scale industry is quite extensively unionised. Two-thirds of
workers in firms employing more than 500 workers are in unions while
one-third of all employed are unionised. These unions operate on an
&#8216;enterprise&#8217; basis, covering just one firm and excluding the
miserably-paid temporary employees because they are not &#8216;regular employees&#8217;.</p>

<p>But many really are company unions, in the sense of tools of the
management. In Nissan (Datsun) for example, the industrial relations
department and the trade union, together, form one well-trodden
promotion system. A worker will be promoted from full-time trade
union work into the industrial relations department.</p>

<p>This is not unknown in Britain, of course, but in Japan he may
well move back to the union on a further promotion.</p>
