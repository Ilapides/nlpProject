<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="fst">The boom in the capitalist world during the 1950s and 1960s
represented the fastest growth of production in human history. But
even this could conceal only to a degree British capital&#8217;s headlong
plunge into oblivion as a world economic power. While continuing to
invest much less than their rivals, the British capitalists blamed
their decline on the improvements in living standards and social
services they were forced to concede to the workers. Their
humiliation was sealed by the defeat of the Tory Government after the
miners&#8217; strike of 1974.</p>
<p>Against this background there is an element of grim satisfaction
amongst the bosses in presenting as an inevitable scaling down of the
pretensions of the mass of workers the developments of the last two
or three years. The million rise of unemployment is said to be the
inevitable &#8220;natural&#8221; result of &#8220;too high&#8221; employment in the
past, the cut in public expenditure is presented as a cut in
&#8220;unproductive&#8221; spending which &#8220;cannot be afforded&#8221;, the cut
in living standards is explained as a facing up to &#8220;economic
reality&#8221;. The real hardship involved in long periods of
unemployment, in hospital wards being closed down, in school children
inadequately fed, in housing waiting lists growing must be endured as
&#8220;facts of life&#8221;.</p>
<p>Revenge is all the sweeter because these &#8220;sacrifices&#8221; are
being imposed by a Labour Government, forced also shelve its plans to
curb the power of capital &#8211; the wealth tax, land nationalisation,
planning agreements, nationalisation of profitable firms. This
pamphlet examines first the depth of the crisis and the policy of the
capitalists which they have forced on the Labour Government. This is
essential in order to take up in a detailed fashion the <em>Alternative
Economic Strategy</em> proposed as an alternative to capitalist
policies by many on the Left of the Labour movement. Given our
assessment of the inadequacy of this strategy in the final section we
consider the basic elements of a socialist plan of production capable
of surmounting the crisis and mobilising society&#8217;s resources.</p>
<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<a name="pt1"></a>
<h3>I. Capitalist Crisis</h3>
<h4>Unemployed Resources and Social Needs</h4>
<p class="fst">As well as the incalculable cost of the demoralisation and misery
of the unemployed and their families, unemployment represents a
monstrous waste of society&#8217;s resources in terms of what those
workers could produce.</p>
<p>There are at present around one and a half million workers
registered as unemployed. Many more people want a job but are not
registered because they are not entitled to benefit or live in areas
where there is no chance of finding work. The Cambridge Economic
Policy Group has estimated that these unregistered unemployed total
nearly one million, bringing total unemployment to around 2&#0189; million
or 10% of the labour force.</p>
<p>10% lost production would be bad enough. But in fact, if all these
workers were employed, production would rise much more than 10%. Not
because t hose out of work are much more energetic than those in
jobs. Nor because they would be working with better equipment &#8211;
firms will obviously try to keep their most efficient plant operating
in a recession.</p>
<p>But the reality is that in many industries unused capacity also
means low productivity. A good proportion of jobs are not tied
directly to the level of production &#8211; the capitalists have to keep
on most office and sales staff even during a fall in production. Also
a growing number of direct production jobs cannot be cut out by the
capitalists as soon as sales fall. Most nineteenth century factories
consisted of large numbers of workers doing a small range of jobs,
and it was simple to layoff a proportion as soon as output fell. But
now many industries involve integrated processes with each worker
like a cog which cannot be removed without the machine grinding to a
halt. And even where there is the technical possibility of culling
employment as output sags, the capitalists&#8217; freedom of action
curtailed by the opposition of the workers.</p>
<p>These technical and &#8216;labour relations&#8217; difficulties explain
why so many redundancies now take the form of the bosses trying to
find an opportune moment to close down a whole plant or section of a
plant, particularly if it is old and inefficient, or one with a high
level of militancy. But they also explain why a low level of
production means low productivity. And conversely that an expansion
of production sufficient to provide jobs for the unemployed would
involve a very substantial increase in productivity as well. The
economists&#8217; calculations are that to increase employment by 10%
(and thus eliminate unemployment) would require increased production
of about 20%. Or to put it in another way, the <em>unemployment</em> of
10% of the labour force involves <em>underproduction</em> of 20%.
Confirmation of this figure, and for the really enormous increase in
production which could be achieved without any increase in employment
at all, comes from a survey of spare capacity in industry.</p>

<h4>Why Has Unemployment Risen?</h4>
<p class="fst">This immediately raises the question of why all these resources
are left unused. If it was true that the unemployed were scroungers
it would certainly be a magnificent testimony to capitalism, that it
turned a large section of society into parasites. Parasites there are
of course, who live on the labour of others, but out of choice and in
great comfort derived from their stocks and shares. The vicious and
reactionary theory that the unemployed are there from choice has no
basis. One of the reforms of the 1964&#8211;70 Labour Government was to
raise the level of unemployment and supplementary benefit relative to
earnings. Bearing in mind that unemployment is concentrated amongst
low-wage sections it has been calculated that the average dole for a
married worker relative to earnings in their most recent job rose
from about 50% in the early sixties to around 60% since the late
sixties; those receiving earnings-related benefit get 75&#8211;80% of
their &#8216;probable earnings&#8217; in work, but only for 6 months
(<strong>Cambridge Economic Policy Review 1978</strong>). It is possible to
find individual cases where these &#8216;improved&#8217; rates have caused
workers to quit a lousy job a bit earlier or to stay on the dole a
week or two longer before being forced into some sweatshop on
starvation wages. But there is no evidence whatsoever that this
applies to very many workers on the unemployment register. And even
if it did, it just means that their place in a particular job is
being taken by somebody else. The Tories and the gutter press never
explain how cutting down workers&#8217; capacity to hold out on the dole
while looking for a job will increase total employment. It would do
nothing of the sort since production is not low because there are not
enough workers but because there are not enough profitable markets.
The campaign against scroungers and in favour of making the dole less
&#8220;generous&#8221; has got nothing to do with reducing unemployment. What
the capitalists are after is making unemployment even more
intolerable, so that fear of the sack is a more potent weapon for
&#8216;disciplining&#8217; the workers.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Technological Unemployment</h4>
<p class="fst">A hundred years ago the Church told people to accept their fate as
the will of God. In 1978 a TV pundit mutters darkly about technology
and presses a button which makes &#8220;2 to 4 million unemployed in the
1980s&#8221; appear in computer-readable lettering on the TV screen
beside him. He is also conjuring up the idea of a process beyond the
control of man. But this new technological fatalism is just as much
of a smoke-screen as its religious counterpart.</p>
<p>For the idea that the mass unemployment of recent years is due to
a sudden acceleration in technical progress has no basis. Certainly
the tendency to replace men by machines (the increase in what Marx
called the technical composition of capital) has been a feature of
capitalist development in recent years. But this is always the case.
It was just as true of the boom of the fifties and early sixties when
there was more or less &#8216;full&#8217; employment. There is absolutely no
evidence that there has been an acceleration in this process in
recent years. Certainly there now seems to be the possibility of a
leap forward in automation opened up by the use of micro-processors &#8211;
the tiny silicon chips with the power of a computer. But this process
has hardly begun and has no connection with present mass unemployment.</p>
<p>And, even if the possibilities for the replacement of human labour
in the direct production process are speeding up, this would only
spell unemployment in the context of stagnant production.</p>
<p>The reason for the rise in unemployment over recent years has not
been a sudden acceleration of productivity &#8211; in fact it has
stagnated. Rather it is explained mainly by the slower provision of
new jobs rather than the faster destruction of old jobs. No more male
workers are joining the dole each year than was case 10 years ago.
The rise in unemployment reflects the fact that each worker put out
of a job, or leaving for some other reason, is finding it much more
difficult to find a new one &#8211; the average unemployed worker had
been looking for a job for 17 weeks in 1977.</p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t there an insoluble contradiction? If investment does
not rise British industries are driven out of world markets and
unemployment rises. If investment does increase it means more and
more workers replaced by machines and unemployment rises. But the
fundamental point is that investment in new equipment does not itself
cause loss of jobs. Certainly in the context of a stagnant market
investment will tend to have that effect, as new capacity, which can
produce more cheaply and which employs fewer workers, displaces older
plant. But in the context of an expanding market, higher investment
would increase employment immediately in the industries producing the
investment goods. And in the longer run extra workers could be taken
on to work with the new plant to supply the growing market, without
requiring the scrapping of old plant. To see investment and technical
progress as destroying jobs is to see just one side of the two-fold
relation between the accumulation of capital and employment. As Marx
explained, on the one side accumulation of capital means more jobs on
the new capacity. On the other hand accumulation &#8216;repels&#8217; workers
as competition from the new capacity drives out old. In Japan for
example in the 1950s and 1960s the industrial capital stock grew at
12.5% a year, three times as fast as the British capitalists managed.
But far from meaning that employment grew slower, it grew at 3.7% a
year in Japan and not at all in Britain. This, despite the fact that
industrial productivity in Japan also grew three times as fast. The
crucial difference is that Japanese capitalists were able to expand
their share of world markets on the basis of this tremendous rise in
productivity, and that their home market was propelled forward by the
massive growth of investment. So the basic reason for the rise in
unemployment faced by British workers over the past ten years is not
too high investment, it is too low a growth of production. In
capitalist terms this means just one thing. Too slow growth of a
<em>profitable</em> market.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Market</h4>
<p class="fst">If the immediate factor behind the rise in unemployment is the
slow growth of the market perhaps the whole problem is due to the
crisis in the world economy. Dennis Healey might be right when he
said in his 1978 Budget speech that &#8220;If we are to solve this
country&#8217;s problems we need to take action on a world scale&#8221;.
However, the idea that the rise in UK unemployment can be blamed
simply on the stagnation in the world economy is completely false.
The following table shows that it is not exports which have slowed
down and account for the slow growth of the last four years. The
stagnation has come predominantly from workers&#8217; living standards
(private consumption), public investment and investment by the
capitalists.</p>

<p class="fst">These cuts cannot be blamed primarily on the world economy. The
basic factor behind these developments was the catastrophic fall in
the rate of profit sustained by British capitalism &#8211; from 13.5% in
1960 to 3.5% in 1975 according to the Bank of England&#8217;s figures for
the pre-tax rate of profit of industrial and commercial companies.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Cuts</h4>
<p class="fst">In response to this decline in profits the British capitalists
have reduced Investment and demanded reductions in living standards
which the Labour Government has implemented through the various
stages of the Social Contract. Moreover they have insisted that the
government cuts its expenditure. There seems at first sight to be
something very contradictory about big business demanding these cuts.
For public expenditure provides markets for private industry directly
(building council houses etc.) or indirectly (through the spending by
teachers of their wages etc.). Moreover, lending to the government to
finance its deficit (the excess of its spending over taxation) has
been (for many capitalists) a more lucrative avenue for investment
than buying more machines, factories etc. So cuts in public spending
mean less markets and less opportunity for lending to the government,
at a time when other markets and investment opportunities are scarce.
In 1975, in fact, interest paid out by the government on the national
debt (which represents the deficits of past years) was actually
greater (at &#0163;4,500 million) than the net profits of industrial and
commercial companies. Isn&#8217;t the CBI cutting off its nose to spite
its face when it calls for further cuts?</p>
<p>But the capitalist class in Britain, even the financiers of the
City who have reaped the immediate profits, have seen the ultimate
futility of lending to the government at the expense of neglecting
reinvestment in industry. For it is only investment in industry which
would allow British capitalism to compete with its rivals on world
markets on the basis of the latest technique of production and halt
the decline of its share of world trade. Only the ploughing back of
profits into new factories and plants, will increase the productivity
of labour in the future and enable concessions to be granted to the
labour movement in terms of wage increases and improved social
services. By contrast, investing profits in government bonds does not
lead to greater productivity in the future. Except in the most
indirect and long-term fashion (via improved health or educational
standards), expenditure on the social services financed by borrowing
from the capitalists is not productive as far as the capitalist
system is concerned. Although the capitalists who lend to the
government receive interest they are in effect sharing in the surplus
value produced, without increasing it. Most government investment, in
schools or hospitals for example, does not lead to cheaper public
services in the future and thus savings for the capitalist class.
Rather it tends to lead to improved services (better hospitals
allowing more sophisticated treatment) and thus more expenses in the
future. The capitalist class in Britain has seen that continuing on
the road of accumulating 10% or more of the national product in the
form of government bonds spells ultimate ruin. The offensive against
public spending, the CBI&#8217;s message that &#8220;it is good to create
wealth&#8221; and that &#8220;wealth has to be created before it is
distributed&#8221; reflect the realisation that lending to the government
to provide concessions for the working class in the form of improved
social services cannot be a long-term strategy. Only driving down
living standards to increase profits, and ensuring they are ploughed
back into investment which improves its competitive position can
restore the position of British capital.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Catch 22</h4>
<p class="fst">The phases of the Social Contract have held down living standards
whilst profits doubled between the summer of 1976 and early 1978. The
massive planned cuts in spending of &#0163;2&#0189; billion per year have been
supplemented by &#8220;unplanned&#8221; cuts of &#0163;4 billion through the
operation of the vicious cash limits system. Still investment is
stagnating. The explanation is that to justify new investment
capitalists do not only require to be earning an &#8216;acceptable&#8217;
rate of profit on their existing investments.</p>
<p>An adequate market in which to sell the extra products turned out
by the new factories is necessary as well. And the attempt to improve
profitability by cutting wages and pushing up unemployment reduces
the level of spending which workers can afford. Sales fall and excess
capacity develops in the consumer goods industries. Cuts in public
spending compound the problem. It seems as though the capitalists are
caught in a &#8220;Catch 22&#8221; situation. If they don&#8217;t succeed in
driving down living standards, profitability is too low to justify
investment. If they do, then there is no market for the goods which
would be produced with the extra plant and equipment.</p>
<p>An individual capitalist can avoid this logic if he can find a
market at the expense of his rivals by driving down his costs (the
living standards of the workers he employs) to a sufficient extent.</p>
<p>Capitalists tend automatically adopt this attitude when confronted
with an overall decline in profitability; the profit margin can be
restored by driving down real wages so that is the first priority.
And, for the capitalist class in an individual country, the strategy
of driving down living standards would work if it could expand its
sales at the expense of its rivals; that is by increasing the share
of its exports in world trade and reducing imports. In the crisis
each country relies on an export boom cutting into the others&#8217;
markets to provide the growing market needed to justify investment.
This is why the CBI announces boldly:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;The aim must be to increase the penetration of
world markets including our own domestic market. All other strategic
objectives, notably high employment, depend on this.&#8221;</em> (<strong>The
Road to Recovery</strong>)</p>
<p class="fst">So it is not that the stagnation in the world economy is the
immediate cause of the crisis in Britain; it is rather that it makes
a way out from the crisis much more difficult.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The World Crisis</h4>
<p class="fst">To hope to secure an export boom on the basis solely of cutting
into other capitalists&#8217; markets is a pipe dream, especially because
capitalists abroad are attempting just the same policies of wage cuts
and rationalisation. Any chance of an export boom depends crucially
on the growth of the world market. If there was rapid growth in the
other capitalist countries then British firms could increase their
exports without the need to secure a higher share of the market. But
the world boom of the fifties and sixties, which to a certain extent
dragged limping British industry along in its wake, is over for good and all.</p>
<p>The most dramatic indicator of this is the slump in investment,
which is the real motor of the capitalist economy. In Europe and
Japan the rates at which the capitalists increased their expenditure
on new factories and machinery, declined, during even the feverish
boom of the early seventies, to little over half the rate of the
early sixties. In the crisis of 1974/5 investment slumped by between
7% (UK) and 22% (Japan). The forecasts for 1978 show private
investment (excluding housing) only at about the 1973 level in all
the major countries except Japan where it is still 15% below the 1973
level. The report of the Bank for International Settlements pointed
out that in Europe investment in new factories and machinery is one
third below the level it would have reached if the trend of the
sixties had continued; in Japan it is less than one half of the trend level.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has
labelled the capitalists&#8217; refusal to invest &#8220;investment shyness&#8221;.
But far from being hesitant to press their claims, all that the
capitalists are shy about is losing their money. For underlying this
decline in investment has been a more or less drastic fall in
profitability in the various major countries. While figures for
profits are notoriously difficult to calculate on a comparable basis
as between countries, the following table does give an indicator of
the decline in profitability within each country:</p>

<p class="fst">The process by which the huge rates of capital accumulation in some
countries such as Japan, and the relatively low rates in others such
as Britain, combined to give a generalised decline in profitability
is a complex question which cannot be gone into here. But the fact
that in each of the major capitalist countries the rate of profit had
fallen by one half or more as compared with the early sixties, shows
the depth of the crisis with which the capitalist class is faced with
on a world scale.</p>
<p>While total profits certainly rose since 1975 in a number of
countries, they have not recovered earlier heights. The first task of
capitalists in all the countries is to restore rate of profit by
driving down real wages, through wage controls and unemployment, and
by increasing productivity through rationalisations and speedups.
Like the British capitalists each group hopes to solve the problem of
markets by expanding at the expense of the rest. But only the strong
capitalists will succeed.</p>
<p>Moreover it is no good the weak countries like Britain calling on
the strong countries to expand their own economies by tax cuts or
higher public spending. They all know that their last attempt in
1972/3 to drive the world economy forward through tax cuts and money
supply increases collapsed in a disastrous acceleration of inflation.
The cuts in living standards have not restored profitability
sufficiently, whilst the resulting stagnation has driven out the
memory of the booming markets of the sixties. Meanwhile the mass
unemployment has not materially weakened the trade union and labour
movement. Together with the cuts it has built up a legacy of
bitterness likely to lead to industrial struggles and Left
governments. Against this background the successive economic summit
statements have a hollow ring. &#8220;We will not allow recovery to
falter&#8221; (Paris, November 1975); &#8220;the soundness and breadth of our
recovery&#8221; (Puerto Rico, June 1976); &#8220;sustained non-inflationary
growth&#8221; (London, April 1977). Not surprisingly the Bonn meeting
(July 1978) sounded a plaintiff note: &#8220;We need an improvement in
growth&#8221;. The Japanese government summed up all their fears when it
pointed out that &#8220;it was important not to end up making everybody
equally weak rather than trying to get all countries equally strong.&#8221;
(<strong>Times</strong>, March 2 1977)</p>
<p>Excess capacity is running at 15% or more in the capitalist world.
Profits are still extremely low. The strong countries are refusing to expand.</p>
<p>The OECD survey of the world economy in July 1977 pointed out the
failure of investment to rise.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The difficulty of stimulating business fixed
investment in conditions of moderate recovery and remaining slack may
have been underestimated. In most Member countries business fixed
investment is likely to remain below &#8211; or only fractionally above &#8211;
the peak attained in 1973. Capacity utilisation rates, already low in
most countries, are unlikely to rise. much over the next twelve
months. Stronger growth in the United States might be expected to
boost business expectations elsewhere, but there are as yet no
indications of this in business surveys. The persistence of inflation
probably weighs heavily on business expectations. Profits, although
recovering over the last 18 months, remain well below pre-recession
levels, and a further shirt to profits may be necessary in many
countries to restore a position which &#8211; other conditions being
satisfactory would encourage productive investment to rise.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">At the end of 1977 the story was the same: &#8220;any marked revival
in business investment &#8211; the essential motor if expansion is to be
sustained &#8211; is now extremely unlikely&#8221;. The July 1978 survey
echoed the same point. &#8220;There is little indication of an impending
upswing in capital formation &#8211; neither profits, capacity
utilisation nor confidence have recovered sufficiently&#8221;.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Protectionism</h4>
<p class="fst">The effect of sluggish investment is that the capitalist world has
stagnated and the possibility is growing that control of imports will
escalate as individual countries seek to protect their markets from
the increasingly fierce competition. One economic historian has
recently described how in the 1930s there was &#8220;a headlong stampede
to protection and restriction on imports, each country trying to ward
off deflationary pressure of imports, and all together ensuring such
pressure through mutual restriction of exports&#8221;.</p>
<p>The April 1978 <em>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</em>
pointed to &#8220;a worldwide and disturbing resurgence of protectionist
pressures which in recent months have reached a level not experienced
for more than a generation&#8221; It blamed &#8220;a search for new panaceas
in the face of unacceptably high unemployment, low investment, an
unhappy combination of recession and inflation, monetary disturbances
and doubts about the stability of the postwar monetary and trading order&#8221;.</p>
<p>The IMF&#8217;s report said &#8220;that by early 1977 it was apparent that
there had been an interruption to the reduction of protectionism that
had characterised the commercial policy of the industrial countries&#8221;
since the War. So far few of these measures have comprehensive,
across the board restrictions (Sweden for example invoked a security
of supply clause, always reserved for strategic materials, to justify
keeping out imports of tennis shoes and Wellington boots!). But the
trend is unmistakeable, as the usually cynically cheerful <strong>Economist</strong>
reported in an extraordinary review-of-1977 article worth quoting at length:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It was easy to believe in free trade when everyone
seemed to benefit. Today, the best it receives is lip-service; and,
in any seriously affected industry, not even that. Subsidies, though
widely practised, were officially regarded as a support to the halt
and the lame &#8211; the Mezzogiorno or the farmers, for instance. Today,
they are, in many countries a normal part of industrial policy. The
industrial development of the third world was proclaimed a case for
public sympathy; now it is privately cursed as a bloody nuisance.</p>
<p class="quote">Another country&#8217;s trade surplus is no longer a virtue
to be emulated but a vice to be denounced; and your own appreciating
currency no longer reason for pride but cause for lamentation.</p>
<p class="quote">The change did not happen suddenly. But 1977 was the year
when it became all but respectable. Near the start of the year, when
the French prime minister used the words &#8216;organised free trade&#8217;,
it was the word &#8216;organised&#8217; that raised eyebrows. So he changed
the slogan to &#8216;orderly growth&#8217; of trade &#8211; and today quite a lot
of eyebrows go up at the &#8216;growth&#8217;.</p>
<p class="quote">The trouble may arise, as in domestic electricals, from a
growth in world capacity as new, cheaper sources of supply are
established, typically in low-wage countries. Or, as in steel and
shipbuilding, it may come from dramatic fall in world demand; those
industries would be struggling today even if the third world had
never set a finger to them. The results in both cases are much the
same: fierce competition, price-cutting and dumping, then protection
to secure home markets and subsides to grab markets abroad. And the
problems look much the same: to protectionists, how to keep the
bastards out, to all but purist free-traders, how to allow time for,
and to ensure, orderly rather than instant and chaotic adjustment.</p>
<p class="quote">But the rich countries are singularly short of any agreed
rules for orderly adjustment. They have no mechanism at all except <em>ad
hoc</em> get-together, as between Europe and Japan in shipbuilding, to
handle proposals for a general reduction of capacity (or the parallel
problem, as in synthetic fibres, the non-installation of gross over-capacity).</p>
<p class="quote">So, instead, the world has built up its private armouries
of unilateral protective measures, bilateral &#8216;orderly marketing&#8217;
or &#8216;voluntary restraint&#8217; agreements, and the multilateral
multi-fibre arrangement.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>North Sea Oil</h4>
<p class="fst">Many people are bound to wonder whether the promised bonanza of
North Sea Oil will allow Britain to escape from the ravages of the
world crisis. Tony Benn, for example, recently said that the
countries to whom the British Government was going cap in hand to
borrow cash will soon come begging to Britain for energy supplies. To
answer this it is necessary to go into the economic effects of North
Sea Oil in some detail.</p>
<p>The Government&#8217;s forecasts are that the UK will be
self-sufficient in oil by 1980; that is equivalent to a saving of
about 13% of imports by 1981.</p>
<p>But while this improvement in the balance of payments does ease
that problem, the following points indicate just how &#8216;marginal&#8217;
is the effect of North Sea Oil.</p>

<ol>
<li>The improvement from North Sea Oil is hardly any greater
than the effect on the balance of payments which has already come
from the earlier development of North Sea gas and which has quite
failed to stem the catastrophic performance of the rest of British industry.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>North Sea Oil does no more than offset the impact on the
balance of payments of the quadrupling of the oil price in 1973. So
only somebody who held that there was no crisis in British industry
before 1973, and that all the problems stemmed from the rise in the
price of Arab oil, could possibly argue that North Sea Oil solved
the crisis. Given the increasingly rapid decline in the position of
British capitalism before 1973, such a view is quite unsustainable.
In fact North Sea Oil does not even fully offset the 1973 rise in
oil costs. North Sea Oil will actually cost more foreign exchange in
1980 than Arab oil cost in 1972. This is because of the profits sent
home by the US oil companies, which have developed much of the
field, and the imports of machinery etc., used in the exploration
and production.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">Using the oil to buy extra imports, takes some pressure off the
pound but any argument that North Sea Oil will transform the position
of British capitalism must rest not on its direct impact, but on
indirect effects on the rest of industry. Can the revenues from North
Sea Oil production be seriously expected to get an investment boom
going?</p>
<p>Now it is certainly the case that the production of North Sea Oil
itself is extremely profitable. The Labour Government did introduce a
special Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) to mop up some of the extra
profits resulting from the huge 1973 increase in the world price of
oil. But this only applied to fields yielding less than 30%.
Estimates of the expected rate of profit from the individual fields
range from around 20% at the bottom and to practically 50% in the
case of Occidental&#8217;s Piper field (<strong>Financial Times</strong>, February
27th, 1976), many times rate of profit in UK industry.</p>
<p>Moreover Labour&#8217;s original plan that the Government share in
these high rates of profit, through compulsorily taking a majority
share holding in all the oil fields already licensed, was dropped in
the face of opposition from the oil companies. It was no good the
government saying that there would be &#8220;no unfairness to the
licensees (of the oil fields) since the state contributes its share
of the costs, including past cost.&#8221; The oil companies obviously
objected bitterly and successfully to losing part of their
super-profits. All that is left of direct state participation is the
right of the British National Oil Corporation to take a majority
shareholding on fields resulting from the much less important rounds
of license allocation in 1977 and later, plus the interests in
various fields inherited from the Gas Council and Coal Board. BNOC
will only get about one tenth of the profits from North Sea Oil in
the early 1980s.</p>
<p>The &#8220;participation agreements&#8221; for existing fields stipulate
that the BNOC should be able to purchase 51% of the oil at market
prices. But in the cases of Shell and Esso the Government has agreed
to sell back an equivalent amount of North Sea Oil for refining in
Britain. These agreements simply have the minimal effect of
guaranteeing British access to North Sea Oil in case of emergency.</p>
<p>The profits resulting from North Sea Oil will be very large &#8211;
around &#0163;2&#0189; billion in 1981 or 1&#0189;% of national product (<strong>National
Institute Economic Review</strong>, November 1977). If all the North Sea
profits were reinvested in British industry they would go over half
the way towards the target of doubling manufacturing investment. But
there is no likelihood that this will happen. Nearly two thirds of
these profits will go abroad to the foreign oil companies which took
the major part of the licences. They will have no reason to invest
these profits back into unprofitable British manufacturing industry.
Nor indeed will the UK firms receive a share.</p>
<p>Of itself North Sea Oil production does nothing to increase the
profitability of the rest of UK industry (since the oil is sold at
world market prices), nor does it widen the market (with the rather
minor exception of those industries supplying the rigs etc.). So this
leaves the question of whether the taxes paid by the companies
extracting the oil could be used to transform the profitability of industry.</p>
<p>The National Institute&#8217;s figures suggest that in 1981 taxes
would be a little less than the profits earned from the oil (together
with revenues of &#0163;300 million or so for BNOC, the taxes from the
North Sea Oil would be less than 5% of public expenditure).</p>
<p>So could the extra revenue equivalent to around 1&#0189;% of GOP be
used to initiate an investment boom? But even if it was all offered
to the capitalists as grants it would not provide a profitable market
which would make it worthwhile investing.</p>
<p>North Sea Oil does improve the balance of payments but not through
a profitable &#8220;export-led boom&#8221; in the rest of industry; and it is
the profitable export-led boom, not the improvement in the balance of
payments, which would be necessary to &#8220;justify&#8217; investment.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A Service Economy</h4>
<p class="fst">One section of the capitalists based in the City of London,
far-sighted enough perhaps to see that the restoration of British
industry on a capitalist basis is a pipedream, has turned to a new
solution. Former Tory minister David Howell has called for an end to
the restrictions on overseas investment, which have been labelled &#8220;a
most sinister infringement of personal freedom&#8221; (<strong>Times</strong>,
January 3, 1978) by Lord Cromer, ex-Governor of the Bank of England.
Sam Brittan of the <strong>Financial Times</strong> explained the advantages
for the capitalists:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8221;To attempt to force still more (!) resources into
domestic manufacturing investment when we are already on the
threshold of negative returns makes very little sense ... with
overseas investment the case is utterly different ... A policy of
overseas investment would not run into the problem of rapidly
deteriorating marginal productivity of capital (i.e. profitability!)
which would beset any forced investment drive at home.&#8221; (<strong>Financial
Times</strong>, September 15, 1977)</p>
<p class="fst">But even if investment overseas promised fabulous profits for the
capitalists, which is certainly not the case in the context of world
crisis, a policy of investing overseas is a policy for driving more
and more industries in Britain out of business. For they are
uncompetitive because they have invested too little. The effect of
more overseas investment on the domestic manufacturing sector is more
or less admitted by Howell when he calls for &#8220;still further
expansion of an immensely profitable service industries at which we
are so good and which earn so much in world markets&#8221; (<strong>Evening
Standard</strong>, November 7, 1977). Could these service sectors provide
jobs for the industrial workers put on the dole by the further
rundown manufacturing? The overseas earnings of service sectors are
very large:</p>

<p class="fst">But most of these sectors employ tiny numbers of people. 88,000
people were employed in sea transport, 78,000 in air transport in
1975. While 690,000 were employed in the financial sector, the great
majority work in the routine High Street operations of the banks,
building societies, and insurance companies. Only a fraction handle
the big international deals, and so expansion of these overseas
financial operations would provide next to nothing in terms of
employment. That is even if it could be achieved anyway. UK
&#8220;invisible earnings&#8221; have fallen from 14.6% of the world total in
1964 to 11.1% in 1973, and there were falls in the British share in
every major category. Howell never explains how the falling behind in
these sectors as well could be reversed.</p>
<p>About the only service sector with big overseas earnings which
does employ large numbers of people is tourism. But what are the
ex-industrial workers of the Midlands, Tyneside, and Liverpool
supposed to do during the long winter months when there are no more
jobs dressing up as beefeaters or selling (Italian) ice-creams on the
beaches? Apart from the dream of establishing financial dominance,
the call for an expansion of the services sectors is really a
recognition that the one advantage British capital has is cheap
labour and that this gives the biggest advantage in &#8216;labour
intensive&#8217; service sectors. But the task of driving industrial
workers into being the skivvies of Europe is no more realistic than
the industrial capitalists&#8217; hope of recreating their lost
industrial might.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Programme of the CBI</h4>
<p class="fst">The capitalist class as a whole is too closely dependent on
industry to succumb to such ridiculous fantasies. The CBI&#8217;s
pamphlet <strong>The Road to Recovery</strong> published at the end of 1976 was
an agenda for wage controls and public spending cuts which has still
not been completed. The CBI said:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The balance of power has been distorted(!)
overwhelmingly in favour of many groups of employees so that
collective bargaining has ceased to be a process whereby voluntary
agreement on terms and conditions is sought to the satisfaction&nbsp;(!)
of both sides and consistent with economic needs.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Subsequently they proposed that all bargaining over wages should
be concentrated in three months after the Budget and that would be a
&#8220;restructured free bargaining system&#8221; to distribute an overall
increase in the wage bill agreed by the CBI, TUC and Government. In
effect there would be &#8220;freedom&#8221; allowed to workers to fight
amongst each other for a bigger share of what the capitalist class
reckoned it could afford.</p>
<p>The CBI&#8217;s pamphlet goes on to document the decline in
profitability in British industry over the last 10 years, together
with the parallel decline in the rate of investment. Even the
increase in profits since the pamphlet was written has not reached
the CBI&#8217;s target of restoring profitability.</p>

<p class="fst">Although profitability has risen by nearly one half since the
summer of 1976 it is still not quite half the level of the mid-1960s.
And a third of the increase in profits has been from North Sea Oil
and so does not reflect higher industrial profits generally.</p>
<p>The hard-liners of the Tory party have no faith in further use of
incomes policy, but are at one with the CBI in wishing to hold down wages.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8221;Monetary restraint, including the setting of targets
for monetary expansion, is a key feature of economic policy.
Excessive wage chums should clearly not be accommodated by an easy
expansion of bank lending. In the public sector this must be
supplemented by the use of cash limits. Every organisation, including
those in the public sector should be put in the position in which
workers and management are obliged to face together an inescapable
choice between realistic pay levels and job security or excessive
earnings and a doubtful future.&#8221; (<strong>The Right Approach</strong>)</p>
<p class="fst">Sir Keith Joseph has made it all too clear how he would like to
proceed. &#8220;As we know, the right to work has come to mean the right
not to work, the right to go on receiving wages, usually high wages,
unrelated to economic contribution,&#8221; and he called British Leyland
and Chrysler, &#8220;foci of highly-paid outdoor relief&#8221; (<strong>Monetarism
is Not Enough</strong>). The leaked Ridley report gave a crude insight
into the strategy of class confrontation which the Tories are working
out, a strategy mapped out much more subtly by Jan Gilmour, the Tory
defence spokesman, in his book <strong>Inside Right</strong>. (See the long
analysis by Peter Taaffe in <strong>Militant International Review</strong>, Summer 1978)</p>
<p>The CBI&#8217;s pamphlet gives some revealing pointers to how they
foresee the dismantling of the so called Welfare State:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li class="quote">&#8220;Rents on municipal housing could be increased
to more realistic levels&#8221; (the CBI does not point out that in 1975
rents paid by council tenants more than paid for maintenance and
depreciation on the houses &#8211; the true cost of the housing &#8211;
while the subsidies of more than &#0163;1,000 million all went to pay
interest on the money borrowed by the local authorities to pay for the houses).<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li class="quote">&#8220;Transport subsidies should be substantially reduced.&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li class="quote">&#8220;There is scope for commercial charging for some
of the services provided which could save several hundred million
pounds. A few examples that could be considered include pre-schools,
leisure courses, school meals, higher charges for certain medical
services. More radical changes, such as the substitution of loans
for grants in higher education and personal insurance to cover the
cost of health care, should also be considered to reduce the burden
on the general tax payer.&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">What is surprising is that the CBI seems to take seriously the
view that if workers are charged more for public services, and if
their taxes were cut by an equivalent amount, they will feel better
off and will be content with lower wage claims. Here we have the
ideology of the free market deceiving not a raving Tory backwoodsman
like Heseltine, but the representative of big capital. A worker faced
with say an extra &#0163;3 per week to payout for rents, school meals,
health charges etc. (this is roughly what the cuts of &#0163;3,000 would
amount to for the average worker if they were all concentrated on
charges for social services) is supposed to be so pleased with the
extra &#0163;3 he receives in reduced taxation (more likely it would be &#0163;1
of course) that he foregoes his next wage claim. Because some of his
consumption is &#8220;privately financed&#8221; (i.e. he pays for it directly
himself), implying a &#8220;wider freedom to choose between public and
private services&#8221;, he is supposed to feel better off. This may seem
plausible to the authors of the CBI&#8217;s programme who no doubt do
feel better off &#8216;privately financing&#8217; their children&#8217;s
schooling and their own private hospital care (at the expense of the
rest of society). But it does not take much imagination to visualize
the attitude of most workers to the suggestion that they should feel
the glow of satisfaction from handing over more cash to the rent
collector or to the doctor&#8217;s receptionist.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Labour Government</h4>
<p class="fst">The perspectives of the capitalist class whether for the
regeneration of industry or the expansion of services offer no
solution to the problems of workers. The Labour Government, under
relentless pressure from the CBI and the City, ably supported by the
IMF, has faithfully followed the demands of the big business, as
described earlier.</p>
<p>In his 1976 budget speech, Dennis Healey said:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8221;It is because our manufacturing industry has declined
since the war both in size and efficiency by comparison with those of
our competitors that our economic record since the war has been
inferior to theirs.&#8221; Remedying this would require &#8220;a major shift
in the use of our resources away from private and public consumption
(i.e. workers&#8217; living standards &#8211; <em>AG</em>) towards export and
investment.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">He summed it up in a remark at the Overseas Bankers Club in
January 1977 that &#8220;firms will only expand and invest if they can
see scope for making profits.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Job Schemes and Subsidies</h4>
<p class="fst">The rising tide of unemployment that has resulted from these
policies has led the government to introduce a barrage of special
employment and training measures to try and keep down the numbers on
the register. Albert Booth claims that after the various
modifications recently announced the total number of workers involved
in the schemes will be 400,000 by March 1979. At the end of 1977
177,000 workers were said to be covered by the temporary employment
subsidy, 47,000 by Job Creation and around 80,000 more by other
experience programmes and training schemes.</p>
<p>The Job Creation Scheme has been correctly criticised for
sometimes involving youngsters in meaningless make-work projects like
knocking down World War II pillboxes. And even the genuinely useful
projects in the area of public services often do no more than stem
the ill effects of the public spending cuts. The left hand obviously
knows what the right hand is doing, but it is convenient to pretend
that some of the effect on employment of the spending cuts is being
offset by the government. But the pretence is thoroughly hypocritical
for in the context of the government accepting that spending has&#8217;
to be cut by so many hundred million, then the more spent on schemes
like the JCS the more that has to be cut elsewhere. In reality, then,
all that happens is that a number of younger workers are taken off
the dole to work on the schemes and in order to &#8216;pay&#8217; for them,
more cuts are made elsewhere, pushing other workers on to the dole.</p>
<p>This effect of shuffling around who is unemployed, rather than
reducing the total number, was even more obvious with the subsidy to
firms to take on school leavers. The <strong>Department of Employment
Gazette</strong> (July 1977) reported a survey which showed that three
quarters of the school leavers taken on by firms claiming the subsidy
would have been taken on anyway, and half of the rest merely replaced
other workers. The school leavers&#8217; subsidy was replaced by the
Youth Employment Subsidy which gives &#0163;10 per week for up to 26 weeks
for firms taking on workers under 20 years of age who had been out of
work for six months or more. The DE dutifully carried out another
survey into its effects (<strong>Gazette</strong>, April 1978) and found almost
exactly the same results. Three quarters of the &#8220;subsidised young
people would have entered their employment regardless of the subsidy&#8221;
and half of the rest were filling jobs which would have gone to
somebody else. However desirable it may be to break up extended
periods of unemployment for youngsters it just shares the misery out
more evenly (and salves the government&#8217;s reputation by allowing it
to boast of the number of jobs covered by its schemes).</p>
<p>Much the biggest employment subsidy is the Temporary Employment
Subsidy which gives &#0163;20 per week for a year for each worker kept on
who would otherwise be made redundant (recently restricted under EEC
pressure to cover only 70% of a firm&#8217;s labour force with the rest
being eligible for a subsidy to make up 75% of lost wages while on
short time). In principle this gets round the problem of giving money
to capitalists to employ people they would take on anyway, since the
applications are supposed to be rigourously scrutinised to ensure
that the redundancies really would take place. The TUC is pressing
for a Job Expansion Subsidy of &#0163;20 per week per job to be provided
for one year to all firms providing an increase in manufacturing
jobs, and so far the Government has responded with the Small Firms
Employment Subsidy (SFES) which does just that (for six months) but
limited to small firms. All these schemes, if they really do save
jobs, have a great attraction for the government since &#0163;20 a week is
much less than the government makes in terms of not having to pay the
dole and in getting the tax and national insurance contributions paid
by the worker. As the DE put it, referring to the TES &#8220;flowbacks to
the Exchequer might amount to three quarters of the worker&#8217;s
earnings&#8221; &#8211; so if the job &#8220;saved&#8221; paid &#0163;60 the government
would gain &#0163;45 and only spend &#0163;20 on the subsidy. Pure magic ... a
scheme which cuts unemployment and government borrowing at the same time!</p>
<p>But do the jobs &#8220;saved&#8221; by TES, or &#8220;created&#8221; by SFES
really reduce unemployment? Or do the subsidised jobs simply
&#8220;displace&#8221; unsubsidised jobs in other firms leading to no real
difference in total unemployment at all? The argument that this
&#8220;displacement&#8221; does occur is straightforward. If a given amount
of commodities are being produced, one firm producing more as a
result of a subsidy, means another firm producing less which will
have to cut its labour force. Since the subsidies do little or
nothing to increase demand for commodities they will not increase
employment. And the government will lose as much tax and national
insurance from the worker &#8220;displaced&#8221; as it gains from the job
&#8220;created&#8221;. All that&#8217;s left is an addition to the numbers which
the government can claim to be helping. And those individuals are
kept off the dole, but just to make way for somebody else. These
schemes must be condemned as basically cosmetic operations.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Industrial Strategy and Rationalisations</h4>
<p class="fst">Dennis Healey, described the &#8220;industrial strategy&#8221;, as the
means by which &#8220;the government, the trade unions and the employers
are seeking to improve the performance of our manufacturing industry,
in particular its productivity and its ability to compete in world
markets.&#8221; The main function of the Sector Working Parties so far
has been providing a forum in which the employers pressurise the
government for more hand-outs. The favoured ones have been successful
in getting a larger slice of the &#0163;3,000 million currently handed out
to big business via Regional Development Grants (&#0163;393 million),
Selective Assistance (&#0163;144 million), Export Credits (&#0163;544 minion),
Industrial Training &#0163;286 million), Employment Subsidies (&#0163;181
million) &#8211; nor to mention the &#0163;4000 million tax concessions to
encourage investment.</p>
<p>The object of such &#8220;planning&#8221; as there has been is not to
expand industry, but rather to savagely &#8220;rationalise&#8221;, as the TUC
sadly noted when it wrote that &#8220;implicit in some of the reports is
the idea that employment reductions are needed&#8221; (<strong>TUC Economic
Review</strong>, 1977). The capitalist hope that by closing down old
plants, and speeding up the production process in the rest they can
reduce costs and increase profits. Indeed the government has used the
companies controlled by the National Enterprise Board to give a lead
to this process (see table below) &#8211; a vicious parody of what the
Board was supposed to do (see pages 43&#8211;45).</p>

<p class="fst">Even with all these efforts manufacturing productivity rose by
only 3% in Britain between 1973 and 1977, as compared with 12% in the
USA, 14% in France and Italy, 19% in Germany and Japan. So the period
of acute crisis since the early seventies has seen a further falling
behind of British capital.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Mass Unemployment Into The Eighties</h4>
<p class="fst">Despite the profits explosion no boom in investment is in
prospect. Forecasts for the growth of manufacturing investment in
1977 were reduced from 15&#8211;20% to 10&#8211;15% and the outcome was only
8%. The same process of downward revision occurred for 1978. The
first forecast was for a 12&#8211;17% rise, revised down to 10&#8211;13%.
Even this is above the National Institute&#8217;s forecast of 5% growth,
slowing down to 4% in 1979. It is no good Dennis Healey bleating to
the City that:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;At a time when ... working men and women are being
asked to show their confidence in the future by continued
self-discipline in pay negotiations, I do not believe it is unfair to
ask that British firms should match that confidence by their
discussions on investment and show for once (!) that their announced
intentions are fulfilled in the event&#8221; (<strong>Financial Times</strong>,
October 21, 1977).</p>
<p class="fst">The stark fact is that after deduction of depreciation net
investment in manufacturing is little over one third of the level of
1961, and probably less than in 1951. Manufacturing output in
mid-1978 was hardly above that of January 1974, at the height of the
3-day week. Stagnation in the world economy is deepening. OECD In
July 1978 forecast that growth in the capitalist world would be
around 3&#0189;% in 1978, and would tend to slow further in 1979. They
forecast UK export growth of only 1% per year. So the dream of an
export-led boom remains just that; and the higher profits of British
firms will be channelled into financial assets. The surplus on the
balance of payments reflects the huge excess capacity in industry
which means lower imports. The enormous rise in the reserves of
foreign currencies &#8211; more than &#0163;15 billion during 1977 &#8211;
represents cash which the multi-national banks and firms have decided
to deposit in the City because interest rates are high and confidence
in the pound improved. But this is simply borrowed money, which could
leave quicker than it arrived. To use it to pay off IMF debts would
merely change creditors, following the advice of the Chicago money
lender who advertised his services with the slogan &#8220;We will lend
you enough money to get you right out of debt&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Government&#8217;s own <em>Public Expenditure White Paper</em> of February
1978 was based on virtually no fall in unemployment up to 1981. <strong>The
Times</strong> (December 14, 1977) reported a Bank of England paper
concluding that it would be impossible to reduce registered
unemployment below the one million mark in the 1980s. Even the
usually optimistic National Institute was unable in its November 1977
discussion of &#8220;medium-term policy options&#8221; to construct a
&#8220;scenario&#8221; with unemployment below a million in the early 1980s.
The Institute for Manpower Studies (<strong>Times</strong>, May 15. 1978)
suggests that in 1986 unemployment of people under 25 will be 1
million, twice as high as in 1976. The Cambridge Economic Policy
Group foresees unemployment of 3 million by 1985 if existing policies
continue. The unanimous view of all the serious capitalist
commentators, then, is that mass unemployment will persist and most
probably increase substantially if present policies continue.</p>

<h3>II. The Alternative Strategy of the Left</h3>
<p class="fst">The conclusion of the first section of this pamphlet is that the
continuance of orthodox policies has no chance of guaranteeing jobs
and living standards. In response to the cuts and mass unemployment
the majority of the left in the Labour Movement, led by the Tribune
Group of MP&#8217;s a number of prominent trade unionists and the
Communist Party are now advocating an <em>Alternative Economic
Strategy</em> to the policies advocated by the CBI and implemented by
the Labour Government. While there are many variants suggested &#8211;
from the &#8220;soft&#8221; version of the <strong>TUC Economic Review</strong> to the
hard versions of some of the Tribune Group and the Communist Party
(CP) &#8211; the measures listed by Brian Sedgmore (<strong>Tribune</strong>,
October 29 1976) under the headline <em>The Alternative Strategy</em>,
provide a useful starting point for discussing the different measures
involved. He gives the following nine points as the &#8220;invisible
bedrock upon which the alternative strategy is founded&#8221;:</p>

<p class="fst">Other ideas usually given a fairly prominent position are the
wealth tax (e.g. <strong>Tribune Group Economic Report</strong>, No.&nbsp;2,
June 1975) and the call for the government to expand the economy
through higher real wages and increases in public spending e.g. Bert
Ramelson&#8217;s pamphlet <strong>Bury the Social Contract</strong>. We also
discuss the 35-hour week, included for example in Stuart Holland&#8217;s
latest version of the Alternative Strategy.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that armed with these policies, a Labour
Government could pressurise what would remain a capitalist economy,
in that the overwhelming majority of the means of production would
remain in private hands, into providing sufficient jobs and
improvements in living standards. One assumption behind this approach
is that the severity of the economic crisis is exaggerated, so that
simply a more determined approach by the government will succeed in
securing a &#8216;better performance&#8217; from industry. If the basic
conditions for the capitalist to invest are present then removing
some of the temptations (property speculation, investment overseas),
together with more pressure from the government and trade unions will
do the trick. Playing down the extent of the crisis ties in with the
even more fundamental assumption that the capitalists will accept the
directives of a socialist government. If more government intervention
could really lead to a boom in the economy, then the capitalist would
stand to gain a great deal in higher profits, as compensation for
allowing the government a more active part in directing the economy.
Moreover the distinctly nationalistic flavour about these policies,
the idea that Britain&#8217;s economic problems can be solved by Britain,
rather than seeing them in the context of a crisis for the labour
movement in the world as a whole, is also related to the depth of the crisis.</p>
<p>The capitalist class abroad has more freedom of manoeuvre
economically and politically to adapt to policies adopted to protect
British capital&#8217;s interests (e.g. import controls), the less
serious is the situation in the world economy. But with the present
crisis in the world economy there is no possibility of the
capitalists abroad accepting measures to restore the position of
British capital at their expense. Much of the detailed criticism of
particular aspects of the <em>Alternative Strategy</em> which follows
rests on the view, argued for in the first section of this pamphlet,
of the deep-seated and international nature of the economic crisis.
But is it really fair to claim that the proposers of the <em>Alternative
Strategy</em> play down the depth of the crisis?</p>
<p>Calculations like those given on p.&nbsp;16 above show the drastic fall
in the rate of profit in the UK over the last ten years. These
figures attempt to measure real profits, that is to exclude the
fictitious element arising from inflation, which is counted in the
profits announced by the companies. The CP&#8217;s pamphlet, <strong>Bury the
Social Contract</strong>, says that these calculations are a swindle &#8220;to
relieve the bosses from the major part of taxes as well as to hide
the real profits being made&#8221;, and that the old conventional methods
of accounting show that there has been no fall in profitability.</p>
<p>Of course the capitalists will use every means available to reduce
the taxes they pay. But the fact that the new methods of accounting
have been devised with this in mind does not mean they are a swindle.
A story from the German inflation of 1923 will show why it is quite
correct to only reckon profits after taking account of the cost of
replacing stocks of goods and machinery at current prices. The story
concerns a young iron monger whose father had always told him that if
he kept the money value of his stocks intact he could treat all the
rest of his takings as profit and spend it on himself. All went well
until inflation began to rocket and then he found that keeping stocks
to the same money value led to his shelves becoming emptier and
emptier. But he kept on enjoying himself, reckoning all his takings
over and above what was required to maintain the money value of his
stocks as profit, as he had been told. Eventually he found himself
without any stocks at all except one nail and a piece of rope, which
were now worth the same as his whole stock has cost at the beginning.
Bert Ramelson points out that all the textile industry&#8217;s reported
profits for 1976 would disappear if the accounts were adjusted for
inflation. But the fact that these methods for adjusting for
inflation are new (for the very good reason that they have only
become necessary with the acceleration of inflation) does not make
them wrong. Profits &#8220;appear to have been squeezed&#8221; on the new
methods of accounting because they have been squeezed; they appear
not to have been squeezed on the old methods of accounting because
these methods are wrong. The textile industry was earning no profit
which it could plough back into expanded plant. The fact that these
methods &#8220;are not applied to measuring wages&#8221; (presumably meaning
that the extent to which wages have been hit by inflation is
concealed where possible) is absolutely right. But &#8220;retaliation&#8221;,
by denying the fall in profits, is to lose sight of real depth of the crisis.</p>
<p>Stuart Holland also suggests that the growing involvement of
British companies in overseas operations has increased than ability
to understate profits earned in the UK by charging low &#8220;transfer
prices&#8221; for their products shipped abroad to overseas subsidiaries
and that &#8220;this factor alone could account for a considerable
proportion of any profits squeeze&#8221; (<strong>The Socialist Challenge</strong>,
p.&nbsp;396). Of course the capitalists will use this method to
transfer profits to where they pay least tax, but it is unbelievable
that there devices could have increased sufficiently to account for
much of the drastic decline in profitability. And the string of huge
firms in dire trouble (Rolls Royce, British Leyland, Alfred Herbert
etc.) shows that it is quite wrong to regard the multinational firms
as substantially immune from the overall decline in profits.</p>
<p>It is a gross exaggeration to suggest that the profits crisis is
fundamentally a reflection of the power and manipulations of the
multinationals &#8211; in squeezing out the small firms and then
syphoning off their own profits abroad. Without the fall in
profitability all the policies of the capitalist class, such as wage
cutting, appear simply as evil-minded greed, rather than as something
which they are forced to do if their system is to survive.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Expand the Economy</h4>
<p class="fst">Expanding the economy is an obvious first step to eliminate
unemployment. This is how <strong>Bury the Social Contract</strong> puts it:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There is only one way to expand the economy and that
is by an incentive to Increase output. The only incentive ... is to
ensure a market for the increased output. The only way to ensure a
market for the increased output is to increase the demand which is
within Britain&#8217;s control. That in turn means and end to wage and
public spending cuts.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">But this approach only sees one side of the dilemma of the
capitalist class &#8211; the question of markets &#8211; while ignoring the
other and equally fundamental, question of profitability. Any policy
which increased real wages, while temporarily improving the market
situation, would further. drive down profits. On the basis of
capitalist production &#8211; that is production for profit &#8211; such
gains in employment as would result from higher demand would soon be
wiped out by a further rush of closures of factories by firms which
could not meet the higher wage bills. The only way this could be
avoided is through the government pumping in sufficient cash into the
economy and letting the pound slide, so that prices could rise at
least as fast as wages and maintain the profitability of production.</p>
<p>The C.P. calls for price controls to prevent the inflation which
would tend to result from an expansion of demand. But to impose rigid
and effective price controls in a situation where workers were taking
advantage of a temporary upswing and an ending of wage controls to
put in for big wage rises would be to drastically worsen
profitability. This would eliminate any possibility of the temporary
rise of production being translated into a sustainable boom through
higher investment. The extra credit would flow into speculation as in
Barber&#8217;s ill-fated boom of 1972/3. The strategy of the capitalist
class sees quite correctly that the contradiction between
profitability and markets can only be solved by expanding at the
expense of the rest of the capitalist world. It is unacceptable to
the labour movement, in terms of reductions in living standards, the
unemployment and the social spending cuts involved; its chances of
success are negligible given the situation in the world economy and
the opposition of the labour movement at home. But the implication
drawn by the CP is to opt for a policy which ignores the workings of
the capitalist system by asserting that in a situation of crisis
production and investment can be expanded by driving down
profitability further. What the CP and the other proponents of the
<em>Alternative Strategy</em> will not face up to is that there is no way to
reconcile the interests of the working class and the continuation of
production for profit. Keynesian policies to expand demand) provide
no solution at all. Obviously all socialists would support the call
for a massive programme of public works to soak up unemployment, but
the proponents of the <em>Alternative Strategy</em> never face up to the
contradictions involved if this is implemented while the economy
remains on a capitalist basis.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Import Controls</h4>
<p class="fst">Superficially the idea of import controls is attractive. A system
of licenses for imports (quotas) would reduce the volume of imports
of those commodities which could be produced at home. The balance of
payments would be improved, and, most important, unemployment reduced
as consumers switch to home produced commodities. The great advantage
claimed for import controls is that, unlike devaluation, the price of
imported commodities is not automatically pushed up.</p>
<p>The first point to be clear about is that import controls would,
mean that British workers would be faced with higher prices. With
their sales limited, foreign capitalists would no longer have any
incentive to undercut British firms and they would raise the price of
the imports which were allowed in. Not only would workers also be
forced to switch to already dearer British goods, but these would
also be increased in price as British capitalists would no longer be
restrained by foreign competition. To a substantial extent, then,
import control is just a variant on the old capitalist theme of the
necessity for the working class to pay, with a wage cut, for the
&#8220;privilege&#8221; of maintaining employment.</p>
<p>Moreover if import controls were introduced there is no reason at
all to suppose that the capitalists would take advantage of the
breathing space afforded them to boost investment and radically
improve efficiency. All experience points in the opposite direction.
In the ten years or so after the War, British capital was virtually
totally protected from foreign competition, both in the home market
and in the colonies. Profits were high, credit was available, the
firms were flush with cash due to investment being held back during
the war. Yet even in the late forties the British capitalists were
only investing half to two thirds as much as their rivals abroad. Of
course <strong>Tribune</strong> pins its faith in boosting investment and
efficiency on the NEB and Planning Agreements. The point being made
here is that without effective government control of industry import
controls would certainly not lead to a revitalisation of British industry.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most basic question is that of retaliation. If other
capitalist countries took similar action against British exports the
whole scheme would be ruined as employment and the balance of
payments would be hit. <strong>Tribune</strong> has suggested that capitalists
abroad should be just as happy to see their exports to the UK limited
by import controls as they would be to see them held down by
deflationary policies. But a deflationary policy-cutting workers
living standards and keeping up unemployment &#8211; is the orthodox, and
correct in capitalist terms, response to the crisis. Import controls
would be seen by foreign capitalists as an attempt to deal with
Britain&#8217;s problems at their expense.</p>
<p>Their reaction would be all the fiercer since the import controls
would have to be concentrated on a relatively narrow range of
manufactured commodities, since more raw materials would have to be
imported to sustain a higher level of production. The Cambridge
Policy Group sees a reduction of imports of manufactures of nearly
one quarter as necessary; and since some sorts of machinery cannot be
produced in the UK with the present capacity, the degree of
restriction on other manufactured goods, such as cars, would have to
be sharper still. Such imports come mainly from the major capitalist
countries &#8211; the EEC, Japan the USA &#8211; which are precisely those in
the best position to take the most damaging retaliatory action. To
label retaliation by major exporting capitalists abroad as based on
&#8220;spite or ignorance&#8221; (Brian Sedgemore, <strong>Tribune</strong>, August 18,
1978) may not be spiteful but it certainly is ignorant; it ignores
the fact that they are bound to protect what are their real interests.</p>
<p>The fact that they have the most to lose from a trade war is
irrelevant. They would use their control of international
institutions like the IMF, on which a capitalist Britain depends, to
do all in their power to prevent the introduction of the controls in
the first place.</p>
<p>The experience of the 1964 Labour Government of Temporary Import
Surcharge is instructive in this respect. Harold Wilson&#8217;s memoirs
(p.&nbsp;35) record the situation less than one month after the measure
was introduced:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;On the night of Thursday 19 November I had an
emergency, almost panic call from Patrick Gordon Walker in Geneva. He
needed my clearance for a firm assurance that the 15% import
surcharge would be reduced in a matter of months. Otherwise the
discussions (with EFTA) would break down and country after country
would be likely to retaliate against our trade.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Within two years Wilson was forced to scrap the surcharge
entirely; and the TIS was a feeble measure, calculated to have
reduced imports by about &#0163;100 million a year, and that at a time
when the capitalist world was still enjoying an unprecedented boom.
For <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme 1976</strong> to say that retaliation did not
occur when &#8220;Britain imposed import controls in the mid-sixties&#8221;
is irrelevant because there was no need for retaliation given the
ineffectiveness of the measures and the successful pressure to end them.</p>
<p>Similarly the reference in the programme to Italy&#8217;s import
deposit scheme not provoking retaliation is not convincing. It was a
very mild measure (simply requiring advance payments for imports), it
was of limited duration (1 year, though subsequently reapplied) and
it was partly aimed at the orthodox objective of deflating the
economy. It is not difficult to imagine what reception a Labour
Government would receive if it attempted to introduce really tough
import controls (<strong>Tribune</strong> talks of &#0163;3,000 million) in a time of
crisis in the capitalist world. With markets shrinking, and
competition intensified, each government would be under overwhelming
pressure from big exporting industries to prevent British capitalists
getting away with the controls, however &#8220;intelligently&#8221; they are
applied, and however much &#8220;care is taken that they do not fall too
heavily on any individual country&#8221; (Bob Rowthorn, <strong>Comment</strong>,
13 May 1978).</p>
<p>The depth of the economic crisis, and the competitive nature of
the capitalist system, make it inconceivable that the British state
could get away without retaliation to the introduction of really
tough import controls. If they were introduced as a last resort it
would probably tip the balance in the world economy towards
widespread protectionism. Workers abroad whose jobs would be
threatened by the controls would be pushed into supporting their
bosses in the campaign for retaliation, and the same thing would
develop in the UK as export industries met retaliation from import
controls abroad. The competitive scramble for tighter import
controls, rather than solving the mass unemployment faced by workers
in every capitalist country, would just make the situation worse as
world trade spiralled downwards, after the pattern of the thirties.
So the demand for import controls must be recognised as being
nationalistic &#8211; an attempt to preserve the interests of the
&#8216;British nation&#8217;, workers and capitalist&#8217;s alike, and on this
basis there would be no possibility of British workers appealing to
the labour movement abroad to oppose the retaliatory action of their
capitalists. A class approach, by contrast, sees the only solution to
the problems faced by workers in all the capitalist countries in a
common struggle against the capitalist system which is the source of
these problems. So any measure which sets workers in this country
against workers in other countries must be rejected. It weakens the
struggle for socialism by strengthening one of the strongest
ideological weapons in the hands of the capitalist class &#8211; the
appeal to workers to make sacrifices in the name of a national
interest being threatened by actions of foreigners.</p>
<p>How do proposers of import controls counter these arguments? In an
article in <strong>Tribune</strong> (November 21, 1975) Brian Sedgemore says
that &#8220;every socialist country in the world, including China, Cuba,
Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, uses such controls on a scale
undreamed of by the Tribune Group&#8221; implying that it is absurd to
call them reactionary. But what he fails to understand is that the
content of a policy depends on the context in which it is introduced.
It is perfectly correct that under a socialist plan of production,
such as Militant argues for, a monopoly of foreign trade would be an
essential planning tool. But there is every difference between a
policy introduced to protect a section of domestic capitalist class
(Sedgemore has never proposed the immediate nationalisation of every
industry where he wants to see import controls introduced) and its
introduction as a necessary part of a socialist plan to control the
economy in society&#8217;s interests.</p>
<p>On the question of exporting unemployment he says that the
purists, &#8220;conveniently forget that the alternatives of deflation
and devaluation do precisely that&#8221;. Sedgemore is perfectly right as
to the effects of these policies; but we do not accept, like him,
that the only alternatives to import controls are devaluation or
deflation (or rather both). These, just like import controls, are
both capitalist policies for meeting the crisis at the expense of
working class living standards. Socialists should never be forced
into arguing for one capitalist solution to the crisis on the basis
that it will be less harmful than other capitalist solutions.
Opponents of capitalist import controls are not thereby supporting
the nineteenth century liberal principle of free trade as Bert
Ramelson suggests. Indeed it is symptomatic of the CP&#8217;s failure to
see beyond capitalist solutions that Ramelson can talk in this way.</p>
<p>Sedgemore says we forget that &#8220;it is capitalist countries such
as Germany and America which, by their insistence on running balance
of payments surpluses despite the colossal rise in oil prices, are
exporting unemployment to Britain&#8221;. But what an argument for a
socialist to use; that we should reply in kind to the capitalist
policy of unemployment. Sedgemore says we forget that &#8220;the Tribune
Group has always excluded the goods of Third World Countries from
such controls&#8221;. But all that means is that the effect on workers on
the advanced countries will be greater (and as we pointed out above
the capitalists in those countries are best able to retaliate).</p>
<p>Sedgemore says that &#8220;it is a demonstrable truth that reflation
behind widespread import controls would lead to such economic growth
that world trade would quickly increase&#8221;. Here he seems to be
arguing for all the major countries to expand behind import controls.
But to the extent that the policy worked it would be the reflation
which would push up world trade, and not the import controls which
would have the opposite effect. Sedgemore gives no analysis whatever
of why the major capitalist countries will not reflate, why they are
all waiting for an export led boom, why they fear growth substantial
enough to push down unemployment. Without an understanding of the
real situation in the world economy, such as we tried to give
earlier, Sedgemore can only complain about the wrong headedness of
the policies of the main capitalist countries.</p>
<p>Finally Sedgemore says that &#8220;every argument which can be adduced
against import control can be adduced against the control of the
movement of capital&#8221;. This is quite ridiculous. How can it be
argued that controlling the outflow of capital will lead to lower
living standards and retaliation costing the jobs of those in export
industries? The effects on the British economy of limiting the
outflow of capital are much over-rated by many of the left (see
below). But controlling the ability of British capital to move funds
overseas is at least a fundamentally anti-capitalist measure (and one
bitterly opposed by the CBI for example). Limiting imports protects a
section of the capitalist class (though it is opposed by the
capitalist class as a whole for fear of retaliation).</p>
<p>Neither import controls nor free trade provide a solution to the
crisis of British capital; the fact that the capitalist class in
Britain may be forced by the growing tide of protectionism, and by
its own weakness, to impose import controls is all the more reason
why socialists should give no credence to them.</p>
<p>Lawrence Harris (<strong>Marxism Today</strong>, April 1977) professes to
find the argument that import controls will tend to export
unemployment to be a Keynesian one. He says that it is impossible to
know the precise effects without &#8220;a detailed analysis of each
country&#8217;s particular circumstances&#8221;. But it is possible to
understand the basic implications of import controls without waiting
for detailed analysis. Harris&#8217; paralysis has nothing in common with
Marxism and serves to cloak the Communist Party&#8217;s nationalistic
approach.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>End Sterling&#8217;s Role as a Reserve Currency</h4>
<p class="fst">This proposal has a slightly dated feel since the government is
already putting into effect a scheme whereby governments which
previously held their reserves in Britain (the sterling balances) are
to be given guaranteed bonds. But this does little to deal with the
speculation that afflicts sterling periodically. For while overseas
governments will no longer be moving their funds out of London the
huge international companies can move billions of pounds out of the
country simply by delaying or speeding up payments to their
subsidiaries abroad. Whether or not they decide to do this has
nothing to do with the role of sterling, but depends on how they view
the underlying prospects for the British economy. It is also rather
bizarre that Brian Sedgemore should advocate handing over the
sterling balances to the IMF as a way of &#8220;free(ing) us from the
dictates of international bankers&#8221;.&nbsp;(!)</p>
<p>This also raises the question of controlling the outflow of
private capital from the UK. There is no exchange control system
imaginable which can determine which overseas payments made by the
monopolies are strictly commercial, and which are tied to protecting
themselves from fluctuations in the exchange rate. The only way to
effectively control such payments would be for these companies to be nationalised.</p>
<p>This was the experience of the Labour Government of 1945&#8211;51
which imposed apparently rigid controls, and when firms had many
fewer overseas links than now. Lord Balogh, an ardent supporter of
exchange controls estimated at the time that there was illegal export
of capital of &#0163;2,000 million between 1946 and 1948.</p>
<p>Control of long-term investment abroad (the setting up of
factories overseas) is a more feasible proposition as identifiable
financial transactions are involved. Indeed quite stringent controls,
in terms of how the investment is financed, how quickly there will be
inflows of profits etc. have been in operation for a number of years,
though are currently being weakened under pressure from the City.</p>
<p>It is often suggested that more stringent controls on foreign
investment would lead to higher investment in the UK. In 1974&#8211;75
overseas investment by British firms was 37% of investment inside the
UK, almost double the ratio of three years earlier. <strong>Tribune</strong> comments:</p> 
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Clearly this trend holds serious dangers for the British
economy. It means that British manufacturing industry is being
starved of the new capital needed to buy the new machinery, expertise
and plants required to improve our international competitiveness and
economic potential.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Now any suggestion that overseas investment involves a drain of
profits generated in the UK is completely incorrect. As the <strong>Treasury
Progress Report</strong> (September 1976) shows direct investment overseas
has actually been less than the profits earned overseas by British
firms, so that there has been a net flow into the British s economy
as a result of past investment abroad. This inflow has been as big as
&#0163;1,500 million per year because the British firms investing overseas
have raised very considerable sums of finance in the foreign
countries concerned.</p>
<p>Of course if the big firms were forced to repatriate all the
profits they earn by exploiting workers overseas this would increase
what they have available for investment in the UK. But it is wrong to
suggest that there would be some more or less automatic increase in
the amount they invest in new capacity. Stuart Holland points out
that British firms produce twice as much abroad in their subsidiaries
as they export, whereas for German and Japanese firms the figure is
about one half. But simply reducing the amount which British firms
can produce abroad, would not lead them to produce at home. In many
cases transport and other costs, or import policies, would make
exporting too expensive. And the capitalists will only plough back
more in capacity in the UK if they see a profitable market to supply.
Rather than additional productive capacity, they always have the
alternative of investing in government bonds or other financial
assets and this would happen if stiffer controls on capital export
were introduced. Simply preventing the capitalists from doing
something, will not automatically cause them to do what the
government wants, especially given the political advantage for them
in showing the government&#8217;s policy to be a failure. Stressing the
role of the multinationals in moving capital around tends to divert
attention from the basic issues as to why capitalist production in
Britain is falling behind. The fact that a government introducing a
real socialist plan of production would certainly have to clamp tight
controls on movement of funds to prevent capital flights, should not
delude anybody into thinking that applying the same type of measure
within the context of the capitalist system would have very
significant results, in terms of higher investment etc.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Muscle to the National Enterprise Board</h4>
<p class="fst">The industries nationalised by the Labour government of 1945&#8211;51
provided the basic inputs of fuel, steel and power for the private
sector. They were mainly unprofitable industries that the capitalist
class in Britain was manifestly incapable of reorganising and
rationalising into the large production units necessary for efficient
operation. The best known example of this is the coal industry, where
as early as 1919 the Sankey Commission had recommended
nationalisation in the interests of efficiency.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of the plan, in Labour&#8217;s <strong>1973
Programme</strong>, to use the National Enterprise Board to take over a
range of giant manufacturing companies was that they were to be
profitable. The original Labour Party Study Group&#8217;s proposal was
for the N.E.B. to take, within a five year period, a controlling
interest in 20&#8211;25 companies controlling about one third of the
turnover and half the employment of the top 100 manufacturing
companies. Labour&#8217;s plan for nationalisation has always been in
terms of industries or firms which were &#8216;failing the nation&#8217; (the
actual phrase used in the <strong>1951 Programme</strong>). The realisation that
profitable (or relatively profitable) manufacturing industry was
&#8216;failing the nation&#8217; in terms of investment, jobs etc. marked a
definite watershed and one which was distinctly threatening as far as
the capitalist class was concerned. The plan for selective
nationalisation remains a cornerstone of the Left&#8217;s policy, being
reiterated for example in Labour&#8217;s <strong>1976 Programme</strong> in terms
of there being publicly owned firms in &#8220;each of the key sectors of
industry&#8221; covering the 32 industries identified by the N.E.D.C.
plus industries &#8220;whose main customer is nationalised&#8221;. In the
shorter term Brian Sedgemore wrote (<strong>Tribune</strong>, April 2 1976):</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The National Enterprise Board might legitimately be
expected within the next two years to extend its coverage and/or move
into the process plan, instrument systems, petrochemicals, chemicals,
ferrous foundry, machine tools, telecommunications and food process
plan, instrument systems, petrochemicals, chemicals, continued growth&#8221;.</p>
<p class="fst">Before examining the political implications of such a programme it
is important to look at whether it really represented a viable plan
significantly increasing government control of the economy. The
theory behind the plan for selective nationalisation of profitable
manufacturing firms is most fully spelt out in <strong>The Socialist
Challenge</strong> by Stuart Holland, an economist influential in drawing
up the plan.</p>
<p>The vital point in Holland&#8217;s analysis is that the group of 25 or
so nationalised manufacturing companies would not merely carry out
expanded investment programmes of their own. (<strong>Tribune</strong> has
often mentioned &#0163;1,000 million per year being invested in this way).
They would also exert a &#8220;pull effect on other big firms,&#8221; based
on &#8220;oligopoly leadership, or the situation in which one of the new
firms at the top end of an industry breaks from the pack and pioneers
a new product or technique on a major scale. While the remaining
leading firms might otherwise have hung around and delayed
introducing a similar project or process, they cannot any longer
afford to do so without risk of losing sales, profits and market
share to the pioneer firm&#8221; (page 185).</p>
<p>Here we have the essence of Holland&#8217;s economic case for
selective nationalisation &#8211; that the extra competition, which the
nationalised firms with the expanded investment programmes would
represent, would force the majority of large firms left in private
hands to invest more. For the competitive pressure proposed by
Holland to work, the private firms would have to have profitable
markets, which for some reason they were not taking advantage of.
This is precisely what they do not have at present. Holland in fact
wants the nationalised firms to be used to get more information on
costs which would &#8220;increase government capacity to levy effective
taxation on real profits&#8221; (page 201) and to act as price cutters
themselves in order to reduce &#8220;excessive&#8221; profit margins. This of
course would simply make the crisis of I profitability worse. The
idea that the industrial capitalists are just &#8220;hanging around&#8221;
waiting for more competition to prod them into massive investment
programmes is a grotesque misrepresentation of the true situation of
British capital over the last decade. Far from there having been
insufficient competition, British capitalists have been manifestly
unable to meet the growing competition in home and export markets
from foreign capitalists. Holland gives no reason why nationalised
competitors should spur them on more successfully. A nationalised
competitor pouring millions into new plant which is uneconomic,
because it is not used to full capacity or because it is too
expensive, would not compel the private firms to follow their lead.</p>
<p>If the finance, the markets and the underlying profitability were
present, then it would not take the leadership of nationalised firms
to persuade the capitalists to invest; their own self interest and
pressure from competitors overseas would be sufficient.</p>
<p>The NEB does have the possibility of taking over profitable
manufacturing companies. The regeneration of British Industry (<em>White
Paper</em>, August 1974) said:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The NEB will be the instrument by which the Government
ensures that the nation&#8217;s resources are deployed to the benefit of
all, by extending public ownership into profitable manufacturing
industry. The Government consider that suitable criteria for the
acquisition of a company should include the following: danger of its
passing into unacceptable foreign control; and stimulation of
competition in a sector where that is weak.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">But even at that stage the potential strength of the NEB had been
virtually annihilated by the phrase &#8220;holdings in companies ...
should be acquired by agreement&#8221;. This was far removed from the
Study Group proposal for compulsory purchase. The guideline for the
NEB published in 1976, stipulated that if the NEB could not get
agreement from the directors of the company it wanted to take over
(which would never happen if the company was not going bankrupt) it
would have to make a bid for the shares in the normal way. The chance
of the NEB persuading a majority of share holders, including the
financial institutions, to agree to the nationalisation of the firm
against the advice of the directors is negligible. It is not simply a
question of the NEB having access to &#8220;a bottomless private purse&#8221;
which would mean that &#8220;prices would obviously be marked up when the
Board arrived on the scene&#8221; (<em>Study Group Report</em>). Rather the
directors, supported by the CBI, the City etc. would launch a
tremendous campaign calling on shareholders to refuse to sell their
shares to the government at any price in order to defend free
enterprise. Such a campaign, given the interest of the big
shareholders, would obviously be successful. No wonder the <strong>Economist</strong>
(February 28 1976) crowed &#8220;The NEB&#8217;s guideline favour the bosses&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the event the NEB, under tycoon Lord Ryder, has been confined
to conducting rationalisations of bankrupt or near-bankrupt firms
(British Leyland, Ferranti etc. see p.&nbsp;29 above) plus a few
deals with small firms. With no real power, and a maximum of &#0163;1,000
million (which would not buy ICI!) it bears no relation to the
original conception.</p>
<p>Why was there such a successful campaign from big business against
the proposal of the NEB to take over 20&#8211;25 of the largest
manufacturing companies? It was never suggested that full
compensation should not be paid to shareholders. There was no
suggestion that they would compete &#8220;unfairly&#8221; with their private
competitors. Surely the power of the capitalist class in Britain was
not threatened by the plan. But the fundamental point is that the
nationalisation of any profitable companies is unacceptable to those
who own and control industry, simply because of what it represents.
The very fact that it would not revitalise the British economy, as
the capitalist class must have known very well, that it would not
give the government real leverage over the non-nationalised
companies, would immediately raise the need for a much more
thorough-going programme of nationalisation, which would give the
government adequate control over the economy.</p>
<p>Every socialist would support the demand for nationalisation of
profitable firms. But those who advocate the type of selective
nationalisation outlined here have never explained how they would
deal with the fundamental question of how to overcome the opposition
of the capitalist class to any measure which seriously threatens to
erode their position, while still leaving them with the main levers
of economic power.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Public Ownership of the Financial Institutions</h4>
<p class="fst">The nationalisation of major banks and insurance companies,
carried overwhelmingly at Labour&#8217;s 1976 Conference, represents a
major piece of unfinished business for the Labour movement. The 1931
Party Conference unanimously passed a resolution calling for the
nationalisation of the banks and the direction of investment. Banking
was the only major sector included for nationalisation in Labour&#8217;s
1945 programme which was left in private hands, only the Bank of
England being taken over.</p>
<p>The most important proposal of the National Executive&#8217;s
statement in 1976 was for: &#8220;A major publicly-owned stake in the
financial system comprising the top seven insurance companies
(sufficient to account for 30% of premium income), a merchant bank
and the four major private clearing banks&#8221; (i.e. Lloyds, Barclays,
Midlands, National Westminster).</p>
<p>The implementation of a real socialist plan of production for the
economy is inconceivable without government control of the financial
system. To produce for need rather than profit requires the whole
financial system to be used for mobilising society&#8217;s resources
wherever they can most usefully be put to work. At the moment the
reverse is the case. It is production which is subjected to the
search by the financiers for fatter profits. A classic example of
this, as the National Executive&#8217;s statement made clear, was the
property boom of the early seventies. The hysterical chase for
super-profits by the City caused a boom in the price of office blocks
and diverted much of the resources of the construct ton industry into
quite superfluous buildings. A socialist plan, by contrast, would use
the financial system to ensure that the cash was available to finance
the undertaking by the construction industry of a huge housebuilding
programme, expanded on the basis of the needs of workers and their
families.</p>
<p>The weakness of the National Executive&#8217;s statement was, that it
tended to exaggerate what could be achieved simply by taking over the
banks. It stressed the low rate of investment in British industry,
and argued that the key to success in reaching the target of doubling
manufacturing investment &#8220;lies in developing a publicly owned stake
in the very areas of the financial system where critical lending and
investment decisions are made: the banks and the insurance
companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>But simply channelling more funds in their direction will not
cause the capitalists to invest. In their evidence to the Wilson
Committee the banks pointed out that Manufacturing industry was
borrowing less than one half of what the banks had made available to
them. The CBI said that:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The clear conclusion of an overwhelming majority of
our members is that it has not been a shortage of external finance
[for example bank credit] that has restricted industrial investment
but rather a lack of confidence that industry will be able to earn a
sufficient return.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">In other words they did not require even more unused borrowing
facilities, but rather higher profits. The NEC&#8217;s original statement
contrasted the lack of government control of finance in the UK with
the situation in other major capitalist countries like France, Italy
and even Japan. But over the last four years fixed investment has
actually fallen or stagnated in all these countries just as in the UK
(see page 15).</p>
<p>Nationalising the banks would in no way give the government the
power to force industry to invest. You can take a capitalist to the
bank but you cannot force him to borrow if he cannot see a profitable
use for the cash.</p>
<p>It is true that the insurance companies hold large volumes of
shares, so that taking over the largest seven would give the
government big shareholdings in many of the monopolies (the
Prudential for example holds more than 1% of the shares of 35 of the
biggest 50 companies). But this is nowhere near control, and the rest
of the shareholders would certainly prevent government
&#8216;interference&#8217;. The situation is quite different from that in
Portugal for example, where nationalisation of the banks gave the
government control over much of industry, for in Britain the banks
lend to industry rather than owning it.</p>
<p>The real conclusion from this is that securing the full use of
society&#8217;s resources requires nationalisation and planning not only
of the financial system, but of industry as well. The two sectors are
inextricably linked in the economy and have 10 be combined in a
socialist plan of production.</p>
<p>The TUC-Labour Party statement of July 1978, however, abandons
nationalisation of the financial system. It calls for the Bank of
England &#8220;to act on behalf of the Government in monetary affairs and
not as an independent body&#8221;; for the Department of Trade and
Industry to &#8220;take the lead in ensuring proper connection between
the financial institutions and the industrial strategy&#8221;, both
entirely vacuous suggestions while the financial system stays in
private hands. It does see &#8220;a need to regroup certain institutions
notably GIRO and the National Savings Bank so that a new
publicly-owned bank can compete on equal terms with the big four
clearing banks&#8221;. But as a concession to those who voted for the
NEC&#8217;s Statement this is derisory. Look at the pathetic size of such
a bank! Whilst the Clearing Banks in 1976 controlled nearly &#0163;24
billion capital, other banks &#0163;8&#0189; billion, and Building Societies
&#0163;33 billion, the National Savings Bank could muster &#0163;2 billion and
the Giro a mere &#0163;176 million. Some competition!</p>
<p>Nationalising the banks, like a number of other elements of the
Alternative Strategy, is an essential element of a real socialist
programme for transforming the economy, and as such every socialist
must support and fight for its inclusion in <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme</strong>
and for its implementation in a socialist fashion. But it is
essential not to be misled about what it could achieve within the
essentially capitalist framework which the <em>Alternative Strategy</em>
accepts &#8211; that is with the overwhelming majority of means of
production in industry in private hands.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Planning Agreements</h4>
<p class="fst">The third string to the alternative industrial strategy is the
proposal that the government should enter into planning agreements
with the major firms. As summarised in <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme 1973</strong>
the role of planning agreements would include:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;1. Securing up-to-date information of a systematic and
continuing basis from all companies and enterprises within the
system. This information will concern both past performances and
advance programmes &#8211; programmes which can be checked later against
results. It will cover such areas as investment, prices, product
development, marketing, exports and import requirements.</p>
<p class="quoteb">2. Using this information to help the government to
identify and achieve its planning objectives, and to plan for the
redistribution of resources which will be needed to meet those
objectives.</p>
<p class="quoteb">3. Securing the agreement of the firms and enterprises
within the system &#8211; the written Planning Agreement &#8211; that they
will help the government to meet certain clearly defined objectives
(e.g. a certain number of new jobs in a Development Area) &#8211; while
leaving the tactics needed to achieve these strategic objectives to
the companies and enterprises.</p>
<p class="quoteb">4. Providing for the regular revision of the agreements
in the light of experience and progress.</p>
<p class="quoteb">5. Providing a basis for channelling selective government
assistance directly to those firms which agree to help meet the
nations planning objectives.</p>
<p class="quoteb">6. Providing a systematic basis for making large
companies and enterprises accountable for their behaviour, and for
bringing into line those which refuse to cooperate &#8211; using, where
necessary, the extensive powers under the proposed Industry Act as
well as the activities of new and existing public enterprises and the
powers of public purchasing.</p>
<p class="quoteb">7. Publishing a detailed annual report to the nation on
the record of the companies and enterprises in the system, and on
their progress &#8211; or lack of it &#8211; in meeting the nation&#8217;s
economic objectives.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">So one aspect of the proposed agreements was the requirement on
the monopolies to reveal a great deal more information to the
government, and to the trade unions concerned. Holland&#8217;s list of
information to be required includes details of past levels and
planned trends of turnover, investment and profits for each main
product (information very seldom available in published accounts),
trade with subsidiaries abroad, amount of government assistance
received, management salaries and all fringe benefits (including
private health arrangements, mortgage benefits, stock option
schemes), details on wages-by work category and plant, advertising
expenditure, main supplying firms and purchasers.</p>
<p>The TUC&#8217;s <em>Checklist for Trade Union Representatives</em>
included the demand for an inventory of capital equipment in the firm
with age specified (<strong>Economic Review</strong>, 1976). This is just the
type of information which socialists have long demanded under the
slogan &#8216;Open the Books&#8217;, in order to reveal the manipulation of
the capitalists and their incapacity to properly develop production.</p>
<p>But the objective of those who argue for planning agreements is
not simply to expose the capitalists, but rather to enable the
government to get the firms to carry out policies (notably investment
programmes) which they would not otherwise do, i.e. which they
consider unprofitable. There is a strong hint in the TUC&#8217;s
checklist that a role for trade unionists in this type of discussion
of management&#8217;s plans is to ensure that management is really acting
in management&#8217;s best interests! How else can one interpret the
TUC&#8217;s suggestion that union representatives should press companies
to set maximum levels of investment overseas, asking &#8220;are companies
satisfied that investment would not be more worthwhile (profitable
presumably &#8211; <em>AG</em>) in the UK&#8221;. But the general drift of
planning agreements is undoubtedly to pressurise firms to do things
which they do not consider profitable. Holland says that the
monopolies should &#8220;be <em>required</em> to reach deep into the kind
of funds which they have been siphoning abroad through transfer
pricing in meeting their future investment needs in this country&#8221; (p.&nbsp;234).</p>
<p>One important weakness of the system as proposed by Holland (and
his is the most comprehensive discussion of how the agreements might
work) is that he envisages the government department playing no role
in drawing up the programmes of the individual companies, but merely
scrutinising them to see whether they conformed With &#8220;the
government&#8217;s overall economic and social objectives&#8221; (p.&nbsp;230).
This is a hopeless task unless the government department concerned
also has a detailed plan for the particular sector(s) where the firm
operates. If the system was to achieve anything it would have to be
in terms of forcing individual firms not just to conform with
&#8216;overall objectives&#8217; but rather with a detailed programme for the
particular sector, based on an overall plan for the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>But the vital question is how <em>could</em> the government force
the individual firms to conform to its requirements. Holland mentions
four ways. He suggests the government could use the nationalised firm
in the sector concerned to carry out the programme if a private firm
refused. How this is supposed to be a- effective threat against a
firm which does not consider the project profitable is quite unclear.
He suggests publication of the government&#8217;s requirements, but the
firm could always counter accusations that it failed to invest enough
by pointing out that it did not consider it to be profitable, that it
had a duty to its shareholders etc. Though the publicity would
obviously be valuable in exposing what the capitalists were failing
to do, it is most implausible that simply bad publicity would change
their minds. Finally Holland echoes <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme</strong> and
suggests withholding government financial assistance (including
presumably refusing loans from the nationalised banking sector) or in
the last resort nationalising the recalcitrant company. Labour&#8217;s
1976 programme talks of power under an Industry Act to issue
directives to companies &#8220;on a wide range of individual matters&#8221;,
of using price controls (presumably making price increases contingent
on investment levels) and of putting in an official trustee to assume
&#8220;temporary control&#8221;.</p>
<p>But as Holland himself says &#8220;A government Bill requiring leading
private companies to expand would be likely to result in at least
widespread non-co-operation, if not a capital strike ...&#8221; (p.&nbsp;186).
Any idea that a capital strike would be frustrated by the activities
of a small number of nationalised firms (how he does not say. perhaps
the capitalists would fear that the nationalised firms would seize
their markets?) is wildly unrealistic. The proponents of the
<em>Alternative Strategy</em> have given no other explanation for their
belief that the capitalists in the vast majority of non-nationalised
firms will forego a capital strike and be prepared to accept the
direction of the government. And they certainly must believe this. or
putting forward the idea that the government can direct the economy
via planning agreements would just be a deception. If they believe
that sufficient pressure can be brought to bear on the capitalist
class to force it to surrender its autonomy, what is the advantage of
leaving them in control of the firms at all? Why don&#8217;t they put
forward a policy for expropriating all the big monopolies which would
give a socialist government the &#8220;leverage&#8221; necessary to introduce
real planning?</p>
<p>So far nothing has come of the planning agreements proposal. <strong>The
Times</strong> (February 17, 1977) reported a statement from one major
company that &#8220;we would sign a planning agreement tomorrow if we
could do it Our way ... We are not reassured by the way in which the
government sees planning agreements and so we will not sign one&#8221;.
The article speculated that by the end of this year the only
companies which will have signed them would all be &#8220;seeking
abnormal nourishment by the Exchequer or some favoured gain in
government policy&#8221;. <strong>The Economist</strong> (November 27, 1976)
reported that in its desperation the government &#8220;would now be
prepared to sign quite meaningless bits of paper if only companies
would be prepared to negotiate them&#8221;. A year or so later the Under
Secretary of State for Industry, Bob Cryer, was bleating &#8220;in view
of the massive amounts of aid to industry which this government has
been giving ... it seems that industry could develop a more
co-operative attitude towards planning agreements&#8221; (quoted in
<strong>Tribune</strong>, by Jeff Rooker, January 13, 1978).</p>
<p>Despite this <strong>Labour&#8217;s 1976 Programme</strong> reiterates the need
for planning agreements in similar terms to previous programmes.
Nowhere in the massive document is there any analysis of why these
proposals have not yet been implemented by the Labour Government.
This is all it has to say on this key issue:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8221;In <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme 1973</strong> we argued that our
planning strategy must be underpinned by new powers and public
enterprise. The Government, we said, must be able to bargain with big
companies from a position of strength. In the <em>White Paper</em>, <strong>The
Regeneration of British Industry</strong>, however, the Government based
the emphasis of its strategy upon winning the co-operation and
confidence of private industry: the planning effort would be on an
entirely voluntary basis. We recognise the Government has made some
progress on this basis. But we believe the analysis and strategy set
out in the <strong>1973 Programme</strong> remains the right one for Britain today.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The proponents of the <em>Alternative Strategy</em> have never made
clear why Government was forced to &#8220;base the emphasis of its
strategy&#8221; on submitting to the C.B.I. The attempt to impose the
outlines of a socialist plan (production for need rather than profit)
on a capitalist economy, which is what the planning agreements amount
to, is bound to be hopeless while the capitalists still hold the main
levers of economic power.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Price Control and Incomes Policy</h4>
<p>Brian Sedgemore says that his alternative strategy will not work
without an incomes policy. Now it is obvious that a socialist plan of
production would have to include a plan for incomes growth, for the
growth of workers&#8217; purchasing power is a central element in such a
plan. As we saw above, the &#8220;alternative industrial strategy&#8221; is
designed to give a Labour government the kind of control &#8211; to
decide investment, production, employment, exports, imports and
<em>prices</em> &#8211; that a socialist plan would allow, but on the basis
of the overwhelming majority of major firms which dominate the
economy remaining in private hands. But as argued above we do not
believe this &#8216;as if&#8217; socialist plan is possible, because those
who own and control the major monopolies will never consent to it. So
it would be quite wrong to call on workers to sacrifice their one
weapon to maintain and improve their living standards &#8211; their
ability to bargain with these self-same monopolists &#8211; and to
jeopardise the maintenance of the strength and independence of the
trade unions.</p>
<p>Brian Sedgemore says in his pamphlet, <strong>The How and Why of
Socialism</strong>:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Are we to go on and agree with the extreme right that
planning incomes is incompatible with a free society? And if this is
the case how do we view planning generally? Surely the essential
point is that planning in whatever sphere it takes place should be
democratic &#8211; not that planning is wrong. What has been wrong with
incomes policies to date is that they have all been used in periods
of economic depression to shift resources from wages to profits ...&#8221; (p.&nbsp;40).</p>
<p class="fst">But it&#8217;s not an abstract question of democracy; after all
incomes policies have been implemented by &#8220;democratically&#8221;
elected governments, and usually agreed with trade unions. The
fundamental point is that under capitalism incomes policies will
always have to conform to capitalist logic of maintaining profits,
and no tinkering with the system removes that fact. Sedgemore never
faces the fact, more of less admitted by John Grahl (<strong>Comment</strong>,
April 29, 1978) that the rate of profit has fallen so low in Britain
that the price controls would have to allow profits to rise, rather
than fall, if there was any chance of persuading the capitalists to
invest. The idea that in general there are fat monopolistic profits
which can be squeezed, while at the same time forcing those self same
firms to invest more by means of offering them cheap loans, just does
not come to grips with the reality of how the capitalist system
operates. How does Sedgemore propose to deal with the strike of
capital which would certainly result?</p>
<p>Of course holding down of prices is essential for workers, but
whilst the economy is run according to capitalist criteria price
controls inevitably degenerate into the kind of farce of the last
year when they are used to ensure huge profit increases. Real
supervision of prices, carried out by committees of trade unionists
and housewives would immediately raise the question of overall
control of the economy given the incompatibility of real price
controls and capitalist criteria.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Maintenance of Labour&#8217;s Social Programmes/Defence Cuts</h4>
<p class="fst">No socialist could quarrel with these ideas. On the first Brian
Sedgemore quotes the <strong>1976 Cambridge Economic Policy Group Report</strong>
suggesting that if the <em>Alternative Economic Strategy</em> were
adopted there would be the possibility of increasing public spending
if full employment could be maintained. The Cambridge Group&#8217;s
strategy has only one thing in common with <strong>Tribune</strong>&#8217;s and
that is import controls. Since Sedgemore points out that import
controls do not add up to an alternative economic strategy (let alone
a socialist one) why does he seek respectability behind the Cambridge
academics? Does he believe his strategy is a <em>socialist</em>
alternative or not? Also how does he feel now that in their <strong>1977
Report</strong> the Cambridge Group say that unemployment could only be
got down to 1,200,000 by 1981 if import controls were used (p.&nbsp;31).
They are admitting that simply using import controls will not secure
enough investment to secure rapid return to full employment. Given
the amount of spare capacity it is quite obvious that returning to
full employment would allow an increase in social expenditure. The
question is whether the <em>Alternative Strategy</em> add up to a
viable way of achieving it.</p>
<p>On defence cuts socialists will want to know if the &#8216;alternative
industrial policy&#8217; is powerful enough to ensure alternative
employment for workers in munitions industries made redundant. It is
precisely one of the major advantages of a socialist plan based on
real control of the economy that whenever it was necessary to run
down a particular industry it would be entirely possible to convert
the plants to produce commodities which were needed, or to build new
factories to take on workers who leave that industry. But the NEB
plus planning agreements would not give that sort of control over
society&#8217;s resources, because the capitalist class would never
permit it.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The 35-hour week</h4>
<p class="fst">Although not one of the original demands of the Alternative
Strategy the 35-hour week has effectively been incorporated into it.
Stuart Holland, for example, calls for a national debate, sponsored
by the NEC of the Labour Party, on the case for the 35-hour week. In
<strong>Full Employment</strong> (edited by Michael Barratt Brown and others)
he says &#8220;The 35-hour week could, and should, be stressed to relate
to the trend of technological unemployment&#8221; (p.&nbsp;135). This,
whilst perfectly correct in particular industries like the Post
Office, is misleading in its suggestion that the mass unemployment of
recent years is primarily a technological question (see p.&nbsp;10
above). The 35-hour week should not be advanced as a desperate last
attempt to hang on to full employment in the face of inexorable
technical trends. The justification in terms of excessively long
hours of work rather gains extra force from the absurdity of these
long hours coexisting with massive unemployment. In 1977 average
hours worked by full-time employees were 41.3 per cent. If these were
cut to 37 (by for example a cut of the &#8216;normal&#8217; working week to
35, plus a reduction of average overtime from 3 to 2 hours) then at a
stroke 10% more jobs would be created, enough to absorb all the
unemployed registered and unregistered.</p>
<p>Whilst every socialist would wholeheartedly support such a
reduction of the working week and elimination of unemployment the
vital question posed is of wages. Any suggestion that the 35-hour
week should be &#8216;paid for&#8217; by a corresponding cut in the weekly
pay packet is quite unacceptable, particularly in view of the cuts in
living standards of recent years. Yet a reduction of say 10% in the
number of hours worked weekly would lead to a corresponding increase
in costs for the capitalists If the weekly wage was maintained. On a
capitalist basis this would involve profits being slashed by at least
half. The capitalists would then press for extreme inflationary
policies of devaluing the pound and pumping up the money supply in
order to allow them to recoup their profits by raising prices. This
is exactly what happened in France when under the Popular Front
Government of 1936 the French workers won wage increases of 30% and a
cut in hours from 48 to 40. Whilst such inflationary policy at the
present time would be fraught with dangers for the capitalist in
terms of the bitter response it would provoke, and the possibility of
hyperinflation developing, they would have no alternative.</p>
<p>Much of the discussion of the 35-hour week is evasive on this
issue. John Hughes, in his detailed discussion of many aspects of the
35-hour week (in <strong>Full Employment</strong>), merely notes that part of
the extra costs for the capitalists &#8220;is likely to be offset ... by
the greater willingness of organised labour &#8211; in return for the
shorter working week &#8211; to settle for more moderate advances in
weekly pay&#8221; (p.&nbsp;114). But in the context of continuing
inflation &#8220;more moderate advances in weekly pay&#8221;, amounts to
exactly the same thing as a wage cut, however much certain trade
union leaders may try to disguise it.</p>
<p>John Hughes says that &#8220;the critics of the 35-hour week raise the
danger of damage to our comparative cost position, the danger of
weakening competitiveness.&#8221; His answer to this is for the TUC to
press other trade union centres abroad to make the same advance,
which, he says, would mean that &#8220;the transition to the 35-hour week
would not be delayed by employer and government resistance based on
fears of adverse effects on the competitive comparative cost position
of anyone country&#8221; (p.&nbsp;122). But it is completely misleading
to suggest that the prime objection of the capitalists to the
reduction in the working week comes from the fact that it would
weaken their relative position. This is certainly an argument that
each individual capitalist class will use to demonstrate the
impossibility of such a demand. But their real objection, which is
that their profits would be reduced because they would have less time
to force their workers to produce surplus value for them, would
remain just as strong if the reduction in the working week was
implemented universally.</p>
<p>The CBI has already begun the attack on the 35-hour week by
arguing that according to its calculations &#8220;a reduction in the
standard working week from 40 to 38 would cut employment across the
country by 100,000&#8221; (<strong>Financial Times</strong>, July 22, 1978). The
answer to this and the wave of propaganda which is developing is not
to delay the campaign until the cut in the working week is agreed
internationally. Rather the argument must be that if the capitalist
system cannot afford a rational system of sharing work and
determining the length of the working week then so much more reason
for replacing the profit system by a socialist plan of production. In
the meantime any firm declaring redundancies on the grounds that it
cannot afford the 35-hour week must be nationalised and the jobs
preserved under the control of the workers&#8217; organisations.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Industrial Democracy</h4>
<p class="fst">The most important proposal under the heading of <em>Industrial
Democracy</em> in <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme for Britain 1976</strong> is that
companies employing over 2,000 workers must establish a Main Policy
Board of which half the places &#8220;would be available for workers&#8217;
representatives, elected through the recognised trade union
machinery.&#8221; This idea is also the main plank of the majority
recommendation of the Bullock Committee, though in the watered down
form of equal numbers (x) of workers&#8217; and shareholders&#8217;
representatives electing an additional number (y) of other members of
the Board. Fundamental to such a concept is the idea that the
interests of capital and labour can be reconciled, that acceptable
compromises can be reached.</p>
<p>The section in <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme</strong> points out that:</p> 

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If a company decides on a five-year plan which involves running down its
British operations, the first workers know about the plan is usually
when the redundancies are announced. All that can be done, through
collective bargaining, is to salvage a compensation agreement.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The implication is that with workers having 50% of the votes on the
Board, which would decide such things as investment programmes, then
an acceptable compromise on a question of closures for example, could
be reached. Lying behind this is the further assumption that with the
benefits of advanced warning, and the powers implicit in the NEB and
Planning Agreement, that &#8220;justified&#8221; closures could be made
acceptable by the provision of alternative jobs, Stuart Holland
writes in his book.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;By the same token, it is crucial that workers in
those enterprises faced with rationalization should secure advance
information on closures if they are to negotiate effectively through
their union structures, either for the provision of new jobs in
acceptable industries, or for the maintenance of the previous
employment where they consider that the management&#8217;s reasons for
closure are inadequate or based on short-term profit maximization
against the longer-term interests of both the workers concerned and
the economy at large.</p>
<p class="quote">In practice, the longer-term view and wider framework of
Planning Agreements bargained on the tripartite basis can also
benefit management itself. If the closure is considered to be
justified, the government should seek advance information from the
unions on the proportion of the existing labour force which would
freely accept severance and redundancy pay. For the remainder of the
labour force, for whom unemployment would be involuntary the
government should seek to assure the provision of alternative jobs at
comparable levels of pay. The government would be able to make major
progress in ensuring the abolition of large-scale redundancies in the
economy, provided that new public enterprise is established on a
sufficient scale both to provide new jobs directly, and indirectly to
lever leading firms in the private sector to cooperate with the
specific location of new plant.&#8221; (pp.&nbsp;274/5)</p>
<p class="fst">The assumption that capitalism can be planned in the interests of
society, that reforms in terms of improved living standards etc. can
be guaranteed, not by the free market itself, but by the free market
tamed by the N.E.B. and Planning Agreements, would provide an
objective basis for the class collaboration implicit these schemes.
The objection to the schemes follows from the belief that such
extensive clipping of the wings of free enterprise is impossible, as
we have argued before. The capitalists would accept some trade union
members on the Board as a way of trying to give them a sense of
power, so that they will more readily take a share of responsibility
and blame. This is especially clear in the minority report of the
businessmen which recommends simply a Supervisory Board with workers
represented. But the difficulty of achieving class collaboration in a
time of crisis means that such plans would develop into demands for
real workers&#8217; management. This makes the capitalist class violently
opposed to even the modest Bullock recommendations &#8211; one of their
representatives on the Committee describing the majority report as
leading to &#8220;bloody chaos&#8221;. But nevertheless such moves should be
opposed since they do give the Illusion that class collaboration, be
it on the basis of much greater planning, is in fact in the interests
of workers. They arise from the unwillingness of the advocates of the
alternative strategy to put forward a demand for real workers&#8217;
control, that is not collaboration with the management, but full
supervision of every action the management takes. Brian Sedgemore
says that the most important aspect of workers being on company
boards is that &#8220;they would be able to inject arguments about their
interests into the boardroom &#8211; an area where such arguments are
inadequately represented at the moment.&#8221; Again this suggests that
class collaboration is feasible, once the workers&#8217; arguments are
&#8220;adequately represented&#8221; no reasonable capitalist could refute them.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Wealth Tax</h4>
<p class="fst"><strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme for Britain (1972)</strong> pointed to the
&#8220;gross maldistribution of wealth in Britain today&#8221; and said &#8220;we
shall therefore introduce a wealth tax, consisting of an annual levy
on the large concentration of private wealth.&#8221; As the government&#8217;s
<em>Green Paper</em> on the tax explained it (in August 1974) &#8220;the
fundamental purpose of the wealth tax is to make the distribution of
the tax burden accord more closely with taxable capacity and thereby
contribute to the creation of a more equitable society in which
social divisions characterised by differences of wealth are reduced
and in which social and economic power created by the possession of
wealth is less concentrated than at present&#8221;.</p>
<p>Figures provided by the Royal Commission on the Distribution of
Income and Wealth give some indication of present degrees of
inequality. In 1972 the top 1% of income receivers got 6% of total
pre-tax income and the top 5% got 17%. Nor does taxation at present
do much to reduce the share of the best off; as the report says
(para.&nbsp;150) &#8220;the effect of all taxes on the distribution is
small, with the progressive effect of direct taxes (income tax,
insurance contribution) ... largely offset by the regressive nature
of indirect taxes (on commodities).&#8221; Since so many people have
virtually no wealth at all the degree of inequality in this respect
is even greater than for incomes. The Royal Commission calculated
that in 1974 the top 1% and 5% of the population held roughly one
quarter and one half respectively of total personal wealth (Table 49).</p>
<p>Of course the apologists of capitalism point to the fact that
there has been some reduction in the degree of inequality (for
example the richest 5% probably held around two thirds of total
wealth in 1960). But this has been largely due to the spread of
ownership of consumer durables, like cars and houses, as workers
secured some improvement in their living standards (by 1973) these
items accounted for more than one half of personal wealth). The rise
in house prices, and fall in share prices, have reduced the value of
ordinary shares. which represent control over the key sections of
British capital, to not much more than 5% of total personal wealth &#8211;
a sure indicator of the declining fortunes of industrial capital. But
of course shares are decisive for controlling the whole economic
system, and they are as unequally distributed as ever &#8211; the top
0.6% of wealth owners held 54% of privately held ordinary shares in
1973 and the proportion of land they hold is greater still.</p>
<p>As the Royal Commission&#8217;s <strong>Second Report</strong> shows the
proportion of shares held by individuals has fallen from nearly 70%
in 1963 to about 50% in 1973, with more and more shares being bought
up by pension funds and insurance companies. But it would be quite
wrong to see the benefit from these as evenly spread; in 1973 less
than one quarter of those with incomes between &#0163;1,000 and
&#0163;2,000&nbsp;p.a. contributed to occupational pension schemes,
whereas 60% of those with incomes above &#0163;3,000&nbsp;p.a. did. In any
case the fact that the pension funds and insurance companies control
these huge chunks of shares in industrial firms in no way disperses
control of the economy in a &#8220;democratic&#8221; fashion, but if anything
concentrates it even further among the handful of directors of the(
huge industrial and financial companies.</p>
<p>The <em>Green Paper</em> of 1974 proposed a wealth tax with rates
beginning at 1% on wealth in excess off &#0163;100,000 rising to either
2&#0189;% or 5%, according to two alternatives, on wealth in excess of &#0163;5
million. It discussed in detail what assets might be included and how
they should be valued; how trusts by which the rich have avoided
taxation should be dealt with (the Inland Revenue now reckons these
to stand at &#0163;6,000 million, excluding another &#0163;2,500 million in
trust for wives); how to deal with problems of small businesses etc.
The question was then referred to a Select Committee of the Commons
to &#8220;hear the views of those directly affected and of anybody else&#8221; ...</p>
<p>The views of those directly affected came in thick and fast,
taking up well over one thousand pages. The CBI describes the
proposals as &#8220;confiscatory&#8221; because &#8220;the combined burden of
income and wealth tax could, after allowing a reasonable margin (!)
for living expenses, exceed the net income of the tax payer in a
particular year, forcing a sale of assets&#8221;; their objection to this
method of redistributing wealth is that it would redistribute wealth.</p>
<p>The CBI proposed that income plus wealth tax should not take more
than 70% of income (considerably less than the theoretical weight of
income tax on the very rich, though they contrive to avoid paying
anything like this by taking their income in the form of capital
gains). They tried to frighten the Committee with a horror story of
how the owner of a business worth &#0163;&#0189; million could find himself
after 35 years owing more in deferred wealth tax than his business
was worth (the Inland Revenue pointed out that with less ludicrous
assumptions than the CBI&#8217;s he would have &#0163;900,000 left after
paying the tax!).</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange thought that &#8220;abiding damage could be
inflicted on the delicate balance of the mixed economy. The
Government seeks to increase investment in industry, but it is
effectively prohibiting the flow of capital through the Stock Market
by the existing and proposed taxation policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the event the Government yet again bowed to the pressure of big
business, and the tax was shelved, though it remains in Labour&#8217;s
1976 programme and seems likely to be revived. But in any case it
would be wrong to overestimate the significance of the tax as
proposed. The Treasury in fact summarised the effects in its own
evidence to the Committee:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is unlikely that the reduction in consumption
associated with the tax will be large ... it is not envisaged
therefore, that the tax will provide scope for any significant
increase in personal consumption (financed by reduced taxation) or
for the financing of additional public expenditure (without the need
to increase taxation) ... the main effect will be to increase total
tax revenue in relation to government expenditure. this means that
over a long period of time the National Debt will fall (or its rate
of growth be lessened) as a result of the imposition of the tax.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">What this amounts to is that the tax would not be heavy enough to
reduce the consumption of the rich, nor to force them to hand over
part of their shares. It would simply reduce the increase in the
national debt. Certainly a slower rate of increase of interest
payments on the national debt would be an advantage and all
socialists would support any measure which reduces the wealth of the
rich. But the reduced holdings by the rich of government securities
would in no way reduce their domination of the economic system
through their ownership of shares; the Labour Party has not been
contemplating a wealth tax sufficiently sweeping to force the
capitalist class to hand over its shares to the government, and if it
did their response to the modest Green Paper proposals would be as
nothing to what would follow. In any case if the objective is, as it
should be, to remove the power from the owners of industry there is
nothing to be said for a really punitive wealth tax, which would take
several years to have this effect, as against nationalisation with
compensation according to need. This would go to the heart of the
matter without trying to make confiscation respectable by doing it
via the tax system.</p>
<h4>* * * * *</h4>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p class="fst">Though we concentrated on the Tribunite version of the <em>Alternative
Strategy</em> is virtually indistinguishable from other versions &#8211;
with the significant exception that many who support virtually all of
the <strong>Tribune</strong> demands would reject any control of wages. This
goes for example for the programme advocated by the Communist Party
for a future Left Labour Government (the <strong>British Road to
Socialism</strong>, Draft 1977, lines 1179&#8211;1245). It contains all the
<strong>Tribune</strong> demands, while on wages says &#8220;a government carrying
out such a progressive programme could be assured that the unions
would take this into consideration in forming their wage demands.&#8221;
On the central question of capitalist resistance the draft has stern
words, but muddled thinking:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The fierce resistance to this policy which would come
from the monopolists and bankers at home and abroad would have to be
met by mobilising wide popular support for it on the basis of full
democratic discussion at every level in society. The right of the
democratically elected government to carry out its programme would be
firmly maintained. Concentrating the measures of nationalisation on
the main monopoly groups would create possibilities for dividing the
capitalist class and preventing united capitalist counteraction.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">A programme of nationalising just the &#8220;key firms among the top
firms which dominate the economy&#8221; (how many, 25?) would still leave
the &#8220;great majority&#8221; of top firms in private hands, subject to
&#8220;drastic controls&#8221;. But the idea that this creates a difference
of interest between the capitalists singled out for immediate
nationalisation, and the rest of the top firms which would simply be
subject to &#8216;drastic control&#8217;, is ludicrous. The rest would know
that the drastic controls must be the prelude to their
nationalisation, and they would be as vigorously opposed to such a
programme of selective nationalisation as the firms immediately
threatened. Only a programme of nationalisation of <em>all</em> the
major monopolies would remove from the capitalist class the crucial
levers of economic sabotage which are at present concentrated in
their hands. Attempts to play off one section of the capitalist class
against another are doomed to failure, since their interests must be
fundamentally the same when it is a question of the implementation of
a socialist programme.</p>
<p>If one theme runs through the various points of the <em>Alternative
Strategy</em> it is that they attempt to implant in a partial fashion
aspects of a fully-blooded socialist plan on what would remain
fundamentally a capitalist organism. Thus we have:</p>

<p class="fst">As already argued the character of these measures of the
<em>Alternative Strategy</em> varies from those which, in general terms
at least, represent a limitation on the power of private capital
(e.g. nationalisation of the banks) to those which many agree can
only be in the interests of big business if instituted while the
economy remains on a capitalist basis (e.g. incomes policy).
Socialists should demand that those elements of the <em>Alternative
Strategy</em> which are in <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programmes</strong> and which do
impinge on capitalists&#8217; freedom should be implemented. But the
fundamental point is that even in combination they do not form a
coherent strategy for planning the economy. And there is a danger
that if put forward in a piecemeal way these demands will form an
easy target for the capitalist media. This was shown clearly by the
opposition stirred up amongst bank workers to Labour&#8217;s ideas of
nationalising the banks. But the solution is not to water down the
policy &#8211; to &#8220;public control&#8221; over the banks as Brian Sedgemore
suggests. But rather to mould them into a coherent and convincing
programme, thoroughly argued for and explained.</p>
<p>By attempting to go part of the way towards a socialist programme,
this strategy is not &#8216;transitional&#8217; to such a programme, but is
transitional to a tremendous disaster. An attempt simply to implement
such a programme would be met by the capitalist using the enormous
economic power left in their hands to sabotage the government&#8217;s
plans. The danger is not just that the ideas of socialism would be
discredited in this way, but that the economic chaos which would
result would pave the way for a reactionary takeover on the basis of
crushing the organisations of the working class, as the Chilean
experience makes clear. From this point of view a thorough critical
analysis of the alternative strategy, despite its support in the
labour movement, does not constitute sectarianism. Rather it is a
vitally serious question for all socialists.</p>
<p>The <em>Alternative Strategy</em> is aimed at meeting the problems of
redundancies, cuts in living standards, cuts in public spending by
means of government policy within the context of a capitalist
economy. We do not accept that this is a coherent strategy, but this
does not mean that these issues should be ignored until the
conditions for implementing a socialist plan have been achieved. On
the contrary the struggle for these immediate questions is essential
for the interests of the working class. Rather than relying on the
<em>Alternative Strategy</em> these interests can only be safeguarded by
workers&#8217; own struggles around the slogans of work or full pay; a
minimum wage of &#0163;70; a 35-hour week; a sliding scale of wages, with
the price index to be worked out by trade unionists; a crash
programme of public works; open the books. The struggle for these
demands by the organisations of the labour movement immediately
raises the question of whether workers&#8217; basic requirements can be
guaranteed under capitalism, and the corresponding need to generalise
these struggles around a programme to transform society. The
transformation of society will never be achieved by the wizardry of
economic tinkerers. It is a political act of the working class; the
need for which will become apparent to broader and broader sections
as their struggles over living standards etc. shows the inability of
capitalism to provide jobs and a decent wage for all.</p>
<p>Analysing the <em>Alternative Strategy</em> in some detail has already
covered, by means of the criticisms made, many of the central ideas
of what we consider a real socialist programme. The next section
takes up some basic issues about what a socialist plan could achieve
and how it would operate.</p>
<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<a name="pt3"></a>
<h3>III. A Socialist Plan of Producton</h3>
<p class="fst"><strong>Militant</strong> campaigns for a socialist programme summarised in
the slogan &#8220;Nationalise the 200 monopolies and the banks under
workers&#8217; control and management, and with compensation according to
proven need&#8221;. This is not intended as a blueprint for the
establishment of socialism, rather to indicate the indispensable
basis for replacing production for profit, by production according to
need, for replacing the blind play for market forces with conscious
social control.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Nationalisation of the 200 monopolies plus finance</h4>
<p class="fst">The extent to which a small number of firms dominate the economy
can be demonstrated by many different statistics. The 100 largest
manufacturing firms are estimated to control nearly one half of
manufacturing production, and the largest 200 about 60%. Drawing the
net rather wider to include commercial firms (retailers, wholesalers
etc.) and property companies, the top 200 companies hold 80% of the
assets held by the top 1,000. Of course there are hundreds of smaller
companies (turnover less than &#0163;13&#0189; million in 1975) which are not
included In the top 1,000, so the 80% figure is an overestimate of
the share of total assets owned by these companies. Yet the 80%
figure is more indicative of the power of the giant companies, and
the extent of control that nationalisation of them would give. In
fact it manifestly understates the degree of control even for
industries where smaller firm predominate. For many of the smaller
firms are basically component suppliers to, or retailers for, the
giant firms. So the top 200 companies are monopolies, not in the
sense that each individually dominates the supply of a particular
product (though many do of course), but in the sense that as a group
they dominate the economy as a whole and practically every sector of
it. There is nothing magical about the figure of 200; it serves to
indicate that just as the giant arms dominate the economy under
capitalism, so they form the basis for carrying out a socialist plan.
For example the huge car firms effectively determine the operations
of the smaller engineering firms supplying components, and the car
distributors. The decisions of the great chain stores control
numerous small producers of consumer goods (Marks and Spencers
already has the reputation for exercising this control in a
particularly active fashion in the case of many textile suppliers).
The giant firms dominate the supply of virtually all the major inputs
of fuel: metals, chemicals etc. So planning the operations of the
monopolies would force the smaller firms to conform to the
requirements of such a plan. There can be hardly one commodity which
in whole or part does not pass through the hands of the monopolies.
Even fish and chips are cooked with corn oil made by Unilevers!</p>
<p>Finally there is control of finance: at the end of 1974 there were
25 financial institutions (excluding insurance companies) each with
capital in excess of &#0163;500 million, and in total they controlled &#0163;72
billion or more than 87&#0189;% of the assets of the top 100 financial
institutions. The biggest 10 insurance companies also comprise around
two thirds of the insurance industry. Nationalisation of the
financial giants is necessary to gain control over the credit system
which as argued earlier is essential to secure the implementation of
plans to expand production and investment.</p>
<p>Obviously, no socialist government would simply nationalise the
largest 200 in mechanical fashion; the London Brick Company which
lies just outside the 200 is obviously of more central importance to
a socialist plan than is the Nestl&eacute; company or Consolidated Gold
Fields (which operates mainly in South Africa). The list of priority
companies to be incorporated into a socialist plan would have to be
drawn up on the basis of detailed information about the different
sectors. This 10 turn could only be done when full access to the
books. of the different companies was a achieved by the action of the
workers. The demand for the nationalisation of the 200 monopolies
plus finance indicates the indispensable basis for planning the
economy. To attempt this on the basis of nationalising 20&#8211;25
companies would be like trying to wag the dog with its tail.</p>
<p>But how would a plan of production actually operate. Is it
possible to plan an organism as complex as the British economy?</p>
<p>As Marx pointed out in <strong>Capital</strong>, the same people who extol
the organisational excellence of capitalist factories and businesses
and the sophistication of the planning techniques available to the
individual capitalist enterprise, also deny the possibility that the
same techniques can be applied to the co-ordination of production
between the different giant enterprises which dominate the economy.
If General Motors is capable of planning of its worldwide operations
(according to its own interests of course) why could not a workers&#8217;
government in Britain apply the same systems to planning the British
economy? General Motors sets production targets for its various
different models produced in the various different countries and
works out the implications for all its factories making the different
mixes of components etc.</p>
<p>In broad terms, exactly the same approach applies to the
implementing of a socialist plan of production. The starting point
must be the broadest political decisions as to how national
production should be divided up between consumption, investment and
provision of social services. The implications for individual sectors
of industry can be worked out using techniques of input-output
analysis which show how the different industries feed into one
another. From this follows output targets for the giant enterprises
which dominate each of these sectors (this is exactly what did not
follow when a similar approach was tried out under the conditions of
capitalist competition with George Brown&#8217;s <em>1965 National Plan</em>.
Then, after an overall production target for the motor industry was
set it was found that each of the giant producers was planning on the
basis of increasing its own share of the market &#8211; a manifest
impossibility of course and a clear example of the futility of trying
to impose a plan on the anarchy of capitalist production). Production
requirements for the giant firms would imply orders for all the
smaller component suppliers. These production targets also imply
labour requirements, volume of imported raw materials required etc.
Investment targets would be set for the different industries to
ensure a balanced growth of production; from these targets would
follow production levels for the industries producing the relevant
items of plant and equipment. While it would be wrong to
underestimate the problems involved in working out the detailed
implications of the plan, it is essentially a technical problem. The
development of capitalist production itself, in terms of computers,
information systems, has rendered planning possible to a level of
sophistication and complexity that could hardly have been dreamed of
40 years ago. In fact the capitalist system has in a sense taken the
process of planning a good way itself by the tremendous
centralisation of production 10 a relatively small number of
enterprises. Essentially it remains to crown the achievements in
technical terms, of the giant capitalist enterprise with a rationally
and democratically worked out plan of society&#8217;s resources, rather
than allowing so much of its productive potential to be wasted by its
subjection to the anarchy of the market.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Workers&#8217; Control and Management</h4>
<p class="fst">Workers&#8217; management of industry refers to the fact that a
socialist plan for the economy as a whole, can only be formulated by
a workers&#8217; government, that is a government subject to workers&#8217;
democracy with all representatives subject to the right of recall by,
and paid no more than, those whom they represent.</p>
<p>What is clear from the history of attempts to plan 10 a socialist
fashion are the twin dangers of an over-centralised bureaucracy on
the one hand or a lack of central direction essential to planning, on
the other. Obviously workers in a particular industry, workers in
other industries (as consumers of the industry&#8217;s products at home
or at work) and representatives of the government (who have the plan
for the economy as a whole to implement) all have a role in the
democratic management of a particular industry. In individual plants
workers&#8217; control means control over the technical specialists, to
ensure the implementation of the plan for the plant, and control over
the immediate issues of hiring and firing, safety etc. The forms of
control would obviously vary from industry to industry depending on
the historical traditions of the workers in those industries and how
these practices, such as control over hiring and firing evolves as
the struggle to dislodge the capitalists develops.</p>
<p>This control would naturally extend to firms not immediately
nationalised and would ensure that these firms too fitted into the
requirements of the plan through fulfilling their obligations to the
State sector.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Compensation Only According to Proven Need</h4>
<p class="fst">The capitalists accuse the Marxists in the labour movement of
wanting to expropriate everything in sight, strewing the country with
destitute widows, orphans and old people. Our programme is certainly
to remove the vast wealth of the tiny proportion of the population
who use it to control society. But the working class would pay
compensation to the dispossessed owners on the basis of proven need.
They would be as free to earn their living by working, or to draw
social security if that was impossible, as anyone else. But small
savings, pension rights etc. would be guaranteed by the state to cut
through the crude propaganda of the press that the socialists would
implement the immediate abolition of all private property. Workers&#8217;
control, in the factories concerned and in the financial institutions
would be essential to prevent evasion by the big capitalists, a
flight of capital etc.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What a Socialist Plan of Production could achieve</h4>
<p class="fst">The proof of the viability of planning is demonstrated by the
experience of Russia, where production grew six and a half times
between 1913 and 1965. And this tremendous development of production
in Russia has been despite the monstrous mismanagement and waste
imposed by the totalitarian rule of the bureaucracy which ever since
the mid-1920&#8217;s has been the source of interminable inefficiencies.
The argument that planning inevitably leads to such a bureaucratic
degeneration is just assertion, based on a crude extrapolation of the
history of the USSR with no attempt to understand the historical
circumstances. Ultimately too it is based on a contempt for the
capacity of workers to maintain democratic control of their society.</p>
<p>Because it is impossible to foresee all the circumstances it is
impossible to draw up a blueprint as to the precise methods of
working out and implementing a socialist plan. A proper analysis of
socialist planning, concentrating on the wealth of experience
accumulated over the last 60 years is beyond the scope of this
pamphlet. But a few general indications of the advantages of
socialist planning and answers to some common objections may be helpful.</p>
<p>The wastes of capitalism are so pervasive that the following is a
sample list:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cost of capitalist competition (duplication of product
ranges between different firms where specialisation would be more
economical, duplication of research facilities, unnecessary model
changes and differentiation of products, advertising etc.)<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Costs of the capitalist financial system (the stock
exchange, a good proportion of the banking system &#8211; not all of
course; the banking system would become an essential part of the
implementation of a socialist plan and workers would require the
banking services to be available, but all the speculative activity
and a tremendous amount of the duplication of facilities, the
existence of numerous banks and building societies in every High
Street, could be eliminated).<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Costs dependent on the antagonistic relations between
capital and labour. Any factory or office obviously requires people
whose job it is to organise and supervise work, but under capitalism
there is a further function (often performed by the same
individuals) of maintaining discipline. Under workers&#8217; control
this function, as a specialised one would disappear, (as would the
whole industrial relations department). It should not be forgotten
of course that, modes of decision making within the factory would
take time; one of the effects of the drastic shortening of the
working week would be that workers would have the possibility of
full involvement in the running of their firms. Similarly many of
the repressive functions of the state (army, police, law) would
cease, at least in, part, to be specialised functions, and costs
could be drastically reduced.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">It is not possible to calculate what resources would be released
by the elimination of these costs of capitalism. While some of the
benefits would come rapidly others would inevitably take a longer
time.</p>
<p>Take the question of duplication of financial services. It would
be foolish to immediately implement a huge rationalisation of the
banking system as soon as the big banks were nationalised, involving
closing thousands of branches. Widespread unemployment of bank staff
would result, and the prospect of this would obviously rally this
section of the working class against the prospect of a socialist
transformation of society. Rather it would be necessary to work out
in advance alternative employment for these people (many for example
might be required in the local offices of the planning apparatus
where their skills and training could be put to good use). The
superiority of socialist planning lies precisely in the potential for
doing this.</p>
<p>The difficulty of quantifying the extent and timing of the savings
involved from the elimination of these wastes should not prevent
socialists from stressing their importance. A similar problem of
quantification arises in respect of the potential increases in
productivity resulting from unleashing the creative ability of the
workforce. The stories about workers suggesting improvements to the
productive process and ending up with a brass handshake of a few
pounds convey a basic truth about capitalist production. Bur even
under what are effectively capitalist relations a recent study of
technical change in the coal mining industry found that about one
third of innovations patented by the NCB on coal cutting technology
came from ideas of those working outside the research departments,
and that more than one half of the ideas in 1973/74 came from
non-professional groups of workers (i.e. not engineers).</p>
<p>Another cost of capitalism which would be eliminated is the
production of luxury goods for the consumption of the capitalist class.</p>
<p>How much could be saved for society by cutting out luxury
consumption? It is extraordinarily difficult to calculate this as the
statistics for the consumption of the rich just are not available
(the figures for their incomes are notoriously deficient, especially
in respect of capital gains which is the main way of becoming
wealthy; there is no adequate information on what they save rather
than consume and there is no overall information about the fringe
benefits supplied by their firms). But looking at the figures for
total consumption, in relation to what workers, pensioners etc. have
available to spend suggests that luxury consumption must be of the
order of 5% of national production.</p>
<p>This may seem quite a small figure though it is larger than some
other estimates. But one family consuming goods worth &#0163;1 million a
year &#8216;only&#8217; consumes 5% as much as do 10,000 families consuming
&#0163;2,000 a year; there just are not that many extremely rich people &#8211;
for example in 1973 less than 1 in 1,000 families had post-tax
incomes estimated greater than &#0163;10,000 a year. The basic point is
that the major gains from socialism will be through full utilisation
and development or the productive forces, which capitalism prevent,
rather than through redistributing what capitalism does produce.</p>
<p>The final and most glaring cost of capitalism is unemployment. As
explained at the beginning of this pamphlet the full utilisation of
society&#8217;s resources would allow a massive increase in production
even before the longer-term advantages of a socially rational
deployment of resources were realised.</p>
<p>But is there some elementary fallacy in this argument as to the
possible increase in production? Where will the money come from? How
could a socialist plan be financed? These objections are based on a
very common misunderstanding about the role of money. The fundamental
point is that commodities are produced by human labour working with
machines etc. There is no problem about a socialist government having
sufficient money to pay the increased wage bills of the nationalised
firms, or for the goods and services consumed directly in the state
sector. All it has to do is to print sufficient cash and distribute
it where necessary through the banking system. There is no question
of this being inflationary as there will be a corresponding increase
in production. The extra cash will perform a purely subsidiary role
in allowing the different commodities to be sold. In fact a planned
expansion is definitely anti-inflationary in that inflation
fundamentally reflects shortages of one sort or another. It would be
necessary that the extra wages paid out should not exceed the extra
production of wage goods planned. But apart from this there is no
question of the &#8220;country&#8221; being &#8220;unable to afford&#8221; the extra
production potentially available. The whole notion is a piece of
capitalist mystification designed to conceal the fact that the reason
for the waste of resources under capitalism is that the capitalists
will not &#8220;afford&#8221; to produce more, in the sense that it is not
profitable for them to do so. Obviously many goods might be
distributed directly rather than by being purchased out of wages. The
point is, though, that even money and wages perform a quite different
role in the context of planning &#8211; that is tools for the social
allocation of resources rather than reflections of the anarchy of the market.</p>
<p>But what of the balance of payments? Would there be a problem
about selling sufficient exports to pay for necessary imports. The
fundamental point is that control over the giant firms means a
virtually automatic monopoly over foreign trade, extended to the rest
of industry through state control of the banking sector. Import
limitation to conserve foreign exchange would serve as one instrument
of a socialist plan, rather than bolstering up backward capitalist enterprises.</p>
<p>It may be objected that this would provoke just the retaliation
which is claimed to be the basic failing of import controls under
capitalism. But the problem of retaliation, and indeed sabotage, from
other capitalist countries does not revolve around the extent of
limitation of imports or indeed the amount of foreign assets
expropriated (26 of the top 200 companies are foreign owned &#8211;
depending on the particular situation it might be expedient to leave
some of them unnationalised but the nationalisation of others would
probably be indispensable &#8211; for example it would be impossible to
implement an effective plan of production for the motor industry
while three of the big four companies remain in capitalist hands).
Bob Rowthorn says &#8220;widespread confiscations, especially of
European-owned property, might lead to a crippling trade boycott&#8221;
(<strong>Marxism Today</strong>, August 1974) and he advocates the use of
British capital&#8217;s vast overseas assets to pay off the foreign
capitalists who own factories in the UK.</p>
<p>But this fundamentally misses the point that the opposition of
world capitalism to a socialist transformation of Britain would not
be based on what it stood to lose directly in the form of assets
expropriated or export markets curtailed. Rather it would derive from
the fear of capitalists abroad that the success of socialism in
Britain would act as a beacon to the working class in their own
countries. Bearing in mind the crisis in their own countries they
would fear expropriation not just of their assets in Britain but of
their assets in their home base. This makes any attempt to buy off
the capitalists abroad an ultimately futile one, for just the same
reasons as attempts to use salami tactics on the capitalists class at
home &#8211; slicing off bit by bit, meanwhile appealing for support to
the rest of the sausage &#8211; must be futile. The only protection
against the attempts of world capitalism to sabotage a socialist
Britain would lie in solidarity action from the labour movement in
the rest of the world. Selling off British owned factories to foreign
capitalists would hardly be the type of action designed to secure
such solidarity. The only way to ensure solidarity is by a clear call
for the rest of the working class on a world scale to support the
expropriation of British capital and to follow suit with the
expropriation of their own bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>Many people who support the alternative strategy of <strong>Tribune</strong>
say that <strong>Militant</strong>&#8217;s programme is unrealistic in the sense
that the majority of people in the labour movement do not accept the
need for such a far-reaching transformation of society. This is not
surprising given the enormous weight of propaganda against socialism
which comes not just from the capitalist press, but from the leaders
of the labour movement as well. But if the organisations of the
labour movement can be won to the necessity of a thoroughgoing
socialist programme this would provide the basis for a tremendous
campaign to explain how the everyday problems of unemployment and
living standards are caused by capitalism and can only be solved
through socialism. It is not in the least unrealistic to believe in
the success of such a campaign once the issues are clearly explained.
To argue like the CP against an &#8220;extensive nationalisation
programme&#8221; on the grounds that &#8220;it would seem to many people like
out and out socialism&#8221; (Michael Bleaney, <strong>Comment</strong>, April 15,
1978) betrays a crippling pessimism about the capacity of the labour
movement to swing the rest of society behind it.</p>
<p>What would be thoroughly unrealistic would be to suggest that the
capitalist class could be dislodged from their dominating economic
position simply by winning the argument and securing a parliamentary
majority for a socialist programme. It is only necessary to look at
the lessons of history, most recently Chile, to be convinced that no
ruling class will ever surrender its power without a struggle. But
such a mobilisation must be around a coherent and effective
programme, not based, as we have argued in the case for the
<em>Alternative Strategy</em>, on a failure to appreciate the necessity
for definitively depriving the capitalist class of its economic power.</p>
