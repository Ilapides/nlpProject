<p class="fst"><em>&#8220;The Trade Unions have it in their power to price their
members or fellow workers out of a job&#8221;.</em> With words like these
Sir Keith Joseph laid it on the line that capitalism in its present
crisis can only provide sufficient jobs on the basis of a deep cut in
living standards for the working class.</p>
<p>He and many other capitalist &#8220;economists&#8221; are speculating
about 1&#0189; million or even more unemployed becoming the new
&#8220;acceptable&#8221; level.</p>
<p>The boom period of the 1950s and 1960s, with relatively low
unemployment (less than 1% in the middle of 1955 for example) was, he
said <em>&#8220;a cruel deception on those whom it was designed to help&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>When the inevitable crisis and recession developed, they were to
be put out of work. This was a clear, if unintentional, indictment of
the whole system&#8217;s inability to provide work on a continuing basis.</p>
<p>In the face of Joseph&#8217;s attempts to smear many of the unemployed
as shirkers, unemployable, or in some way &#8216;voluntarily&#8217;
unemployed, the Labour Movement must reply that all unemployment is
the result of the capitalistic nature of the system. In a unplanned,
anarchic labour market, it is inevitable that many of those who are
sacked, or who find their existing job intolerable, will have to go
on the dole before they find another.</p>
<p>Anxiety about whether a job will turn up builds up from the first
day of unemployment. This often forces workers rapidly into wretched
jobs (half those signing on stay on the unemployment register for
less than two weeks) but this is no justification for Joseph to
assert that anybody who has been on the dole for less than two weeks
is not really unemployed!</p>
<p><em>The other side of this rapid turnover is that each year there
are between 3&#0189; and 4 million registrations of unemployed people
seeking work according to Department of Education (DEP) figures.</em></p>
<p>Though a number of workers will be on the dole more than once a
year (20% of the unemployed at any one time have had more than one
job in the previous year) the level of job insecurity shown by these
figures is horrific.</p>
<p>The fact that in the past there were often more unfilled vacancies
than registered unemployed does not imply that there has been
&#8220;negative real unemployment&#8221; as Joseph says. Rather, it shows
that pursuit of private profit means that capitalism is incapable of
providing jobs where workers live, or to provide training in the
necessary skills. This is despite the huge bribes which Governments
have used to encourage firms to move to regions of high unemployment
and to stimulate private training.</p>
<p><em>Particularly scandalous is the fact that unemployment of lads
under twenty grew twice as fast as male unemployment as a whole
between 1959 and 1972.</em></p>
<p>And this was in a period when increasing numbers stayed on at
school beyond the statutory leaving age.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>&#8220;Unenthusiastic&#8221;</h4>
<p class="fst">Staff in DEP local offices, reckon according to a recent survey in
the <strong>DEP Gazette</strong>, that about one third of the unemployed have
poor prospects of finding work because of old age and ill health.
This does not show that they are &#8220;unemployable&#8221; as Joseph would
have us believe.</p>
<p>Capitalism, having exploited and abused their capacity to work,
has no further need for them. Indeed, many of the quarter million who
are out of work due to sickness, but are not registered as
unemployed, should also be counted as being out of a job due to the
ravages of capitalist living and working conditions.</p>
<p>In 1971 there were 5,000 accidents per week in factories which
caused absence from work of more than 3 days.</p>
<p>The same survey reported that the DEP offices regarded one third
of the unemployed as &#8220;somewhat unenthusiastic for work&#8221;. To
argue, as Joseph does, that these people are &#8220;voluntarily&#8221;
unemployed is ludicrous. No doubt the majority of those with a job
are &#8220;somewhat unenthusiastic&#8221; about it! They, like more than one
in ten of the unemployed, show &#8220;reluctance to accept the discipline
of work&#8221;, that is, of the capitalist factory.</p>
<p>Another survey showed that only 14% of those out of work had left
their job voluntarily; most of these would immediately take up a
reasonable job offer.</p>
<p>Joseph&#8217;s suggestion that unemployment has been increased by a
larger dole finds no support in the survey. Only 7% of the unemployed
were judged by the DEP to be liable to earn as low sum as the dole if
employed, and only half of these were thought to be &#8216;unenthusiastic&#8217;
as a result!</p>
<p>In any case it is a miserable reflection on the system that
anybody&#8217;s prospective pay is no more than the disgracefully
inadequate dole.</p>
<p>As well as those out of work due to sickness there is another
large group who have no job but who do not register as unemployed for
one reason or another. From the 1971 census it was estimated that
there were 300,000 in this category (230,000 women). The report
recognised that this is probably a large understatement.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Over One Million Now</h4>
<p class="fst">Number of people who know they have no hope of a job, particularly
in areas of high unemployment &#8211; won&#8217;t bother even to tell the
Census that they are looking for work.</p>
<p><em>If we add to the official figures all those who the workings of
the capitalist system keep out of a job, the total of unemployment
even now is certainly over one million (or about double the official
figure).</em></p>
<p>All this is mild in comparison with what might lie in store.</p>
<p>The spectre of mass unemployment is now held out by the
capitalists. They have talked about a figure in &#8220;the low millions&#8221;
for some years. What does that mean in human misery and degradation?
The rich regard it as a small price to pay to &#8220;stabilise&#8221; their
system.</p>
<p>Labour must wage a remorseless campaign against redundancies.
There can be NO &#8220;acceptable&#8221; level of unemployment. If the bosses
cannot provide work then they must provide full pay.</p>
<p><em>If they will provide neither then that must be used as a
rallying point for Labour to take them over and finish the system
that breeds the horrors of unemployment.</em></p>
