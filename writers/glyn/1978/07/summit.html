<p class="fst"><i>The Bonn Economic Summit between the heads of the seven most
powerful capitalist countries was the fourth annual meeting of its
sort. Taking place in a blaze of publicity and with statements from
individual leaders as to their &#8216;purposeful&#8217;, &#8216;frank&#8217; and
&#8216;constructive&#8217; nature, these meetings are supposed to give the
impression that things are in hand, that the world economy is capable
of being controlled in an effective fashion.</i></p>

<p>But the &#8216;currency&#8217; issue by these summits &#8211; statements about
the imminence of a sound recovery &#8211; has far exceeded their real
effects. Just like any other currency issued in excess of real
production, the result has been a devaluation &#8211; a scepticism about
the real value of these jamborees. The cynicism with which the
<b>Financial Times</b> greeted the Bonn get-together &#8211; &#8220;no real
harm may be done&#8221; (July 15th) &#8211; was matched by the <b>Economist</b>&#8217;s
verdict that &#8220;it steered just clear of disastrous failure&#8221; (July 22nd).</p>

<p>In 1976 they set a growth target of 5&#189;% a year until 1980; the
increase in production in 1977 was 3Â¾%, and in 1978 will be about
3&#189;%. Unemployment has stuck at around 5&#189;% since 1976, and the
inflation rate has only inched down &#8211; from 9% in 1976 to a forecast
7&#189;% this year.</p>

<p>In 1977 Japan committed itself to a 6.7% rise in output for that
year, but achieved 5%; West Germany reaffirmed a 5% growth target but
grew at 2&#189;%.</p>

<p>This time they were more cautious. Federal Chancellor Schmidt
undertook to take measure to boost demand by 1% of GNP, whereas
Fukuda, the Japanese Prime Minister, said he was &#8220;striving&#8221; for
growth 1&#189;% faster than the previous year. The Italian Prime Minister
undertook to raise growth by 1&#189;% by, among other things, cutting
public expenditure &#8211; a highly paradoxical &#8216;solution&#8217; which will
provide no consolation to the million Italian workers on the dole.</p>

<p><b>The Times</b> (July 18th) summarised the prospects as follows:
&#8220;If all the stimulus measures go into effect and if there is no
downturn in other countries during the second half of 1979 it may be
possible to get the overall growth of the world up to about 4 or 4&#189;
per cent by the end of 1979. This would be enough to stabilise
unemployment, although probably at a higher level than the 17 million
in the industrial world at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fundamental reason for the stagnation of the world economy is,
as explained many times in <b>Militant</b>, the world-wide refusal of
the capitalist to invest.</p>

<p>The recent report of the &#8220;authoritative&#8221; Bank of International
Settlements shows (p.&nbsp;47) that in Europe investment in new
factories and machinery is one third below the level it would have
reached if the trend of the &#8216;Sixties has continued; in Japan it is
less than <i>one half</i> of the trend level.</p>

<p>The <b>National Institute Economic Review</b> (May 1978, p.&nbsp;38)
shows that investment in the capitalist world fell by an
unprecedented 11% in 1974 and 1975, and that its recovery
subsequently has only been at half the 10% growth rate of previous expansions.</p>

<p>The capitalists themselves will not invest because their profits
are low, excess capacity is very high, and they are totally
demoralised about the prospect of a sustained recovery. The
governments of the major countries know that their last attempt in
1972/3 to drive the world economy forward through tax cuts and money
supply increases collapsed in a disastrous acceleration of inflation.
The cuts in living standards and public services have not been enough
to restore profitability but have further contributed to the
stagnation of markets.</p>

<p>The mass unemployment has not materially weakened the trade union
and labour movement, but together with the cuts has built up a legacy
of bitterness likely to erupt in major industrial struggles. The
prospect of &#8216;left&#8217; governments in France and Italy has only been
postponed. All these factors are reflected in the capitalists&#8217;
profound &#8216;lack of confidence&#8217;, against which summitry has no impact.</p>

<p>The summit statement says &#8220;we are concerned, above all, about
worldwide unemployment because it has been at too high a level for
many years,&#8221; and that &#8220;we need an improvement in growth where
that can be achieved without rekindling inflation.&#8221;</p>

<p>But these are just crocodile tears and pious wishes. It was no
accident that when pressed on what had been achieved Jim Callaghan
hastily changed the subject to the agreement on terrorism.</p>
