<h1><small><em>Cambridge Economists Predict:</em></small><br/>
Five Million Unemployed by 1990</h1>
<h3>(April 1978)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;402, 21 April 1978, p.&nbsp;6.<br />
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<br />
<p class="fst"><em>Denis Healey said that the &#8220;first purpose&#8221; of his Budget
was to &#8220;get unemployment moving significantly down.&#8221; This is most
unlikely to happen this year even on his own figures, and for the
longer term he contented himself with platitudes about the industrial
strategy and the need for world expansion.</em></p>

<p>Recent <em>White Papers on Public Spending </em>and <em>North Sea Oil</em>
(<strong>Militants</strong>, Nos.&nbsp;398 and&nbsp;400) show that the
government has no strategy for eliminating unemployment.</p>

<p>The <em>Cambridge Economic Policy Group</em>&#8217;s recent <strong>Review</strong>
has now come up with the chilly prediction that, if present policies
are continued, <em>unemployment will rise towards five million by
1990</em>. In fact you don&#8217;t need their elaborate computer model to
reach that figure if you assume that unemployment will continue to
rise at the recent rate of nearly 250,000 a year.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Idle Machines</h4>

<p class="fst">The Group suggests that a 50% increase in manufacturing investment
is necessary to avoid mass unemployment. But it is absolutely wrong
to suggest that it is impossible to employ more workers in
manufacturing without an investment boom. Hundreds of thousands more
workers could be employed in existing manufacturing plant, if only it
were profitable to do so.</p>

<p>The industrial areas are littered with empty factories and idle
machines. Much of it may be old and inefficient but it could still
produce socially useful things. In the context of a socialist plan,
based on social need rather than profit, full employment would not
have to await an investment boom.</p>

<p>But granting that higher investment is desirable to raise
efficiency, how could new investment, plus rapid expansion, be
achieved? The Cambridge Group quite rightly points out that large
scale closures of factories, as in shipbuilding and electrical
engineering, have not brought recovery to those industries; nor have
government handouts.</p>

<p>But they conclude:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In our view, there is no possibility of
carrying through such a programme <em>without protection by means of
import controls or other means of discriminating in favour of home
industries</em>, because this alone will provide an assurance that new
capacity can be operated at a high level of utilisation.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">As to whether the capitalists would really modernise, the Group
just puts its faith in &#8216;financial incentives or controls&#8217; (type
unspecified, planning agreements perhaps), ignoring the fact that in
the past the capitalists have reacted to protection by complacency
and profiteering rather than expansion and modernisation.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Retaliation</h4>

<p class="fst">But what of retaliation, which the Cambridge Group regards as the
one &#8216;really serious&#8217; objection to import controls? All they say
is that if the refusal of other capitalist governments to &#8220;sanction
import restrictions is the major obstacle to industrial and economic
recovery in Britain, this should be made plain and the matter argued
out on that basis.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is just about as helpful as bluntly telling the Scottish fans
that their team won&#8217;t win the World Cup because the other sides
won&#8217;t agree to hop about on the field on one leg!</p>

<p>The failure of the Cambridge Group to face up to the reality of
the capitalist world system is strikingly revealed in the chapter by
Francis Cripps, adviser to Tony Benn. He proposes not simply import
controls, but discriminatory controls against the strong countries &#8211;
precisely those best able to retaliate.</p>

<p>So the Brazilian, Dutch and German teams are supposed to accept
being confined to hopping all the more readily as that handicap would
be restricted to those teams the Scots know they couldn&#8217;t beat anyway!</p>

<p>As <strong>The Economist</strong> (1 April) sourly notes, the Cambridge
Group do not &#8220;notice that every controlled import is a lost job in
the exporting country. And then it, too, could control its imports.
As the process spreads, balance of payments constraints would melt
away. Along with much else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unlike most capitalist economists, they see that the capitalist
system, uncontrolled, means mass unemployment. They are quite right
to hammer the government&#8217;s complacency. But their own policy of
import controls is a fantasy, not a magic solution of a new Keynes as
Brian Sedgemore suggests (<strong>New Society</strong>, 8 April).</p>

<p>What the Cambridge Group, and Brian Sedgemore, cannot admit is
that it is impossible to control the capitalist system &#8211; other than
by replacing it with a socialist plan.</p>
