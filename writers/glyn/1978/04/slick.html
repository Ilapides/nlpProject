<p class="c"><em>Andrew Glyn [Oxford Labour Party] assesses the government&#8217;s
White Paper, <strong>The Challenge of North Sea Oil</strong></em></p>
<p class="fst">A small part of the promised bonanza from North Sea Oil has
already been squandered &#8211; on producing a <em>White Paper</em> on the
<strong>Challenge of North Sea Oil</strong> full of vague platitudes.</p>
<p>The document smugly refers to the participation agreements between
the nationalised BNOC and 44 oil companies. But it does not mention
their content:&#8211; agreement by the companies to sell 51% of their oil
to British National Oil Corporation, provided the Corporation sells
it back to them at the same price! It boasts that Petroleum Revenue
Tax, royalties, and Corporation Tax will get the government 70% of
the revenue from the fields. But it fails to mention the rates of
profit of up to <em>50% after tax</em> received by the companies.</p>
<p>The flavour of the <em>White Paper</em> is brought out best by the
list of the uses the government has in mind for the oil revenues,
reproduced below (capital letters and all) from the introduction:</p>
<ul>
<li>GUARANTEEING general investment incentives.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>EXPANDING selective assistance (to particular capitalists).<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>SUPPORTING the NEB.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>TACKLING the problems of Scotland and the development areas.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>FURTHERING the industrial strategy.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>REDUCING personal taxation to improve incentives.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>BOOSTING investment in new sources of energy.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>CONSERVING existing energy supplies.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>SUPPORTING the planned expansion of communications, docks etc.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>STRENGTHENING the programme for reinvigorating inner city areas.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>DEVELOPING even more ambitious training programmes to prepare young people for the world of work.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>HELPING people to continue education and training throughout life.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>PROVIDING more and improved social services.</li>
</ul>
<p class="fst">This is a pretty long list over which to spread the expected tax
revenues from the North Sea of £2 billion in 1980 or even the £4
billion hoped for in 1985. In fact, it is amazing that the government
has the nerve to include expansion of the social services as one of
its priorities when its own Public Spending White Paper plans for
school building in 1981 to be one third of the 1972 level and
hospital building only two thirds (<strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;397).</p>
<p>All the talk of a &#8216;fairer and more compassionate society&#8217; is
no more than a cover-up for a programme of restoring the position of
British capitalism. How else could you have the statement &#8220;many new
jobs should become available in the service sector, including the
public services&#8221;, followed by the sentence &#8220;The government
intends to retain a firm control over public expenditure so that it
does not absorb too high a proportion of the nation&#8217;s resources?&#8221;</p>
<p>The White Paper starts out by bemoaning the feeble performance of
British industry. It quite correctly says that &#8220;the inadequacy and
poor productivity of investment in a number of sectors of United
Kingdom industry has been an important factor&#8221;.</p>
<h4>Strategy?</h4>
<p class="fst">It goes on:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It would be all too easy for Government to use the
extra revenue simply to finance a quick improvement in living
standards through tax reductions and increased social benefits to an
extent which left insufficient room for increased productive
investment ... It would be wrong to spend the benefits of North Sea
Oil this was. It will be recalled that a useful balance of payments
surplus was built up in 1969&#8211;70; but that this was rapidly
dissipated in a short lived consumer boom in the early seventies
leaving no permanent improvement in our economy ... Sustained
economic growth and a return to full employment would not be possible
if our investment strategy were to fail.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Now it is rubbish to say that if living standards and the social
services were increased by the extent of the oil revenues, then there
would be &#8216;insufficient room&#8217; for productive investment. The extra
resources from North Sea Oil are less than one fifth of the size of
the resources wasted each year in British industry due to the unused
capacity of 20% or more, as revealed in the National Institute&#8217;s
survey of last year.</p>
<p>The reason that capacity is not used is simply that it is not
profitable to do so. If it were mobilised there would be plenty of
resources for additional consumption, social expenditure and
investment. What the White Paper is really saying is that the
capitalists will not expand production and increase investment unless
the workers&#8217; share of the wealth (&#8216;living standards&#8217; and
&#8216;social benefits&#8217;) is held back to &#8216;make room&#8217; for higher profits.</p>
<p>What then is the Government&#8217;s &#8220;investment strategy&#8221;? It is
summarised in the memorable sentence: &#8220;Investment can be planned
and executed only within industry itself.&#8221; The best the Government
can do is to &#8216;help&#8217; by using the oil revenues to guarantee the
continuation of the present level of investment incentives (currently
worth more than £4,000 million a year), which the <em>White Paper</em>
concedes to be &#8220;already comprehensive and generous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the CBI&#8217;s protests at the proposed expansion of
selective grants to particular industries and firms &#8211; their
objection is to the <em>selectivity</em> not the grants of course &#8211;
there is no question of the government really getting control of
profitable manufacturing investment as envisaged in <em>Labour&#8217;s
Programme 1973</em> (or 1976 for that matter) through the NEB and
Planning Agreements.</p>
<p>True, the NEB has a &#8220;vital role&#8221; through its major
subsidiaries &#8220;exploiting important growth opportunities or
assisting industrial restructuring&#8221; (along the lines of Speke?) and
through backing &#8220;enterprising small firms in areas of high
unemployment&#8221; (which won&#8217;t disqualify any enterprising small
firms). Buried, though for good and all as far as the White Paper is
concerned is the idea of nationalising major, profitable companies in manufacturing.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Contradiction</h4>
<p class="fst">There is also a ritual bow to Planning Agreements to &#8220;provide a
means of concerting action by Government and individual firms&#8221; but
there is no discussion, of course, of why only one has been signed;
that one, with Chryslers, showed that the only action the capitalists
will agree should be &#8220;concerted&#8221; is bailing them out when they
are bankrupt.</p>
<p>But will the government&#8217;s strategy of bigger handouts, combined
with its general policies of trying to hold down the exchange rate
and wages to maintain competitiveness (profitability), really work?</p>
<p>The White Paper admits that &#8220;no programme designed to stimulate
investment can succeed unless the economic background encourages
industrial expansion.&#8221; Simply giving the capitalists more cash will
not lead to increased investment unless they can see a profitable market.</p>
<p>But generating a rapid expansion by cutting taxation and
increasing social spending would not lead to an investment boom
either as the experience of the early seventies shows. Because of the
increased share of wealth which would go to the workers, the
capitalists would not foresee profitable investment opportunities in
private industry and would invest their profits in property
speculation and the like.</p>
<p>So the government faces a contradiction. Without an expansion of
the economy, the capitalists will not invest. With too rapid an
expansion, they will not invest.</p>
<p>If only other countries would respond to the Government&#8217;s urging
of &#8220;the need for effective action to bring the world economy out of
the present recession&#8221;.</p>
<p>But the very day before the <em>White Paper</em> was published <strong>The
Times</strong> reported from Brussels that Denis Healey had failed to
persuade the German government to take more expansionary action, and
the EEC was foreseeing growth of less than 3% this year as compared
with the target of 4&#8211;4&#0189;% set last autumn.</p>
<p>The fact is, that the Government has no coherent strategy for
North Sea Oil revenues, or anything else for that matter, to restore
full utilisation of society&#8217;s resources. All it can do &#8216;if the
world economy does not recover rapidly&#8217;, is to &#8220;start expanding
the economy through appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Illusions</h4>
<p class="fst">Presumably Dennis Healey&#8217;s Budget will contain measures aimed at
securing perhaps 3&#8211;3&#0189;% growth. But this with 20% excess capacity
would leave the extent of unemployment and wasted resources unaffected.</p>
<p>The government has totally abandoned Labour&#8217;s policies to get
control over the investment and production decisions of the private
sector, policies which <strong>Militant</strong> has always argued would be
insufficient, but which would at least be a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>The only useful purpose served by this White Paper would be if it
finally lays to rest the idea that the cuts of the past three years,
plus North Sea Oil, will see the economy right &#8211; and thereby brings
it home to those who had illusions in North Sea Oil as a magic
solution that socialist policies provide the only means of planning
the resources of the North Sea and the UK as a whole.</p>
