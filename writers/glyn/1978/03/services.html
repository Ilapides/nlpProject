<p class="c"><em>Andrew Glynn reviews the Government&#8217;s White Paper on public
spending.</em></p>
<p class="fst">After the cuts of the past three years, many Labour Party members
looked forward to a major expansion of the public services in the
late &#8216;Seventies, in line with the <em>Manifesto</em> promises. The
government&#8217;s public spending <em>White Paper</em>, published in the middle
of January, has dashed these hopes.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, current expenditure, on keeping the health and
education services going and on social benefits, is planned to rise
in line with &#8216;demographic factors&#8217; &#8211; the number of people
needing these services and benefits. Meanwhile, capital expenditure
on new hospitals, schools, roads, etc. will hardly grow from its
present, slashed level.</p>
<p>Overall, real public spending will rise at about 2% per year till
1980, but this will rule out practically any improvement in services,
and with staff having to cope in older and older buildings in many
sectors, further deterioration is inevitable.</p>
<p>Here are some &#8216;highlights&#8217; of this wretched document:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1981 total investment by the public sector will be only
<em>three quarters</em> of the level of 1973; increases between now
and 1981 will make up for only about one sixth of the cuts made up
to now.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Subsidies made by the government to hold down the prices of
food, goods and services provided by the nationalised industries,
housing, etc. will be cut by a further Â£500 million from the
present level and by 1981 will be only slightly above one half of
the 1974 level.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Local authority capital expenditure on housing in 1981 will
be more than 10% below the 1974 level.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>School building in 1981 will be less than <em>one third</em>
of the level of 1972.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hospital building in 1981 will be <em>two thirds</em> of the
level of 1972.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Despite an increase in number of teachers employed of 9,500
as compared with previous plans, the total number will still fall by
21,000 between 1978 and 1981. So much of the potential benefit of
falling numbers of school children in reducing class sizes will be
lost.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Debt interest in 1981 will be double the 1974 level, and
about three times the level of spending on school and hospital
building.</li>
</ul>
<p class="fst">No less horrifying than these details from the document, are the
underlying assumptions on which it is written. For the government is
planning for growth in the economy up to 1981 of no more than 3&#0189;% a
year. Not that this isn&#8217;t an improvement on the last four years
when there&#8217;s been virtually no growth at all.</p>
<p>But this should not hide the fact that the government is quite
openly budgeting for mass unemployment on into the &#8217;Eighties. The
White Paper suggests that those receiving unemployment benefit will
fall from 710,000 this year to 510,000 in 1981. What it never makes
clear is how much of this fall is due to a fall in the total number
out of work, or to fewer of those unemployed being eligible.</p>
<p>Any conclusion from those figures that unemployment will fall by
almost a third would be quite wrong. With output only growing &#0189;%
faster than capacity (according to the government&#8217;s estimate of 3%
capacity growth), and with current excess capacity around 20%
(according to surveys of industrial capacity), it would take <em>twenty
years</em> to reduce unemployment by one half.</p>
<p>No more obvious example of the bankruptcy of the government&#8217;s
policies is imaginable. Any programme for regaining full employment
rapidly must include a programme of public works to ensure the public
services have up-to-date facilities.</p>
<p>But without real control of the economy, and without fitting the
plan for public spending in a socialist plan for the expansion of the
whole economy, any gains in reduced unemployment would soon be wiped
out as firms took advantage of higher demand to restore profits to
the level investors are demanding.</p>
<p>That is why the campaign against the Labour government&#8217;s cuts
cannot be separated from campaign to implement a socialist economic programme.</p>
