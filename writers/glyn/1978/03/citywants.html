<p class="fst">With all the jubilations from Denis Healey about his &#8216;financial
miracle&#8217; and how we are about to reach the promised land of
economic recovery as North Sea Oil flows in, people are beginning to
ask where the oil money will actually go.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&#163;&#163;&#163;</h4>

<p class="fst">The January issue of the magazine <b>The Banker</b> reported a
survey of the views of a sample of stockbrokers and bankers on the
decline of sterling and what should be done with North Sea Oil revenues.</p>

<p>More than three quarters said that the City had suffered from the
decline in sterling over the last ten years. They blamed the
uncertainty which it caused and also the fact that it reduced the
size of UK banks, measured by their assets in comparison with banks
in countries whose currencies had risen relative to the pound. This
meant a scaling down of the City&#8217;s pretensions to world financial dominance.</p>

<p>One third admitted that relaxing exchange controls to allow more
foreign investment, a process which the Labour government has already
begun and is under strong pressure to step up, would lead to a large
outflow of funds.</p>

<p>The most interesting answers, though, were in reply to the
following questions:</p>

<p class="fst">Repaying overseas debt and increasing overseas investment were
both rated as twice as important as expanding domestic demand to
reduce unemployment. This reflects the fear of the bosses that a
substantial reduction in unemployment would stoke up inflation and
lead to wage claims which would jeopardise the recent recovery of
profits.</p>

<p>The City does recognise the necessity of a strong industrial base
for their financial operations: &#8216;directing&#8217; oil revenues into
British industry was rated as an important priority, and a quarter of
those asked also felt that the government should try to hold the
pound down, presumably to increase industrial competitiveness.</p>

<p>Of course their ideas of &#8216;directing&#8217; probably involve greater
handouts from the government in the form of investment grants etc.
Obviously any realistic &#8216;direction&#8217;, that is nationalisation of
the banking sector and the major industrial monopolies to ensure that
extra funds made available actually were invested, is far from what
these financiers have in mind!<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&#163;&#163;&#163;</h4>

<p class="fst">Any thought that they might be going soft in the defence of their
interests is corrected by their attitude to public spending. Cutting
corporation tax and reducing public sector borrowing is evidently <i>at
least fifteen times as important to them as increasing public
spending on the welfare services. For these well-heeled gentlemen who
send their kids to private schools and can afford the privilege of
private medicine such things as free education, the NHS, council
housing etc., are just a waste of money!</i></p>
