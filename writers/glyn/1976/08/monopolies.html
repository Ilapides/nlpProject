<p class="fst"><i>In 1909 the largest manufacturing firms produced 16% of UK
manufacturing output. In 1970 their share had grown to 46%, and the
compiler of these statistics speculated that the figure would be two
thirds by the mid-1980&#8217;s.</i></p>

<p><i>The fundamental factor behind this tremendous &#8216;centralisation&#8217;
of capital [to use Marx&#8217;s words] has been the pressure on the
individual capitalists to make the maximum profits from the
exploitation of their work force and to grow at least as fast as
their rivals. This is essential if they are to stay in the race for
technical efficiency, which is continually demanding larger and
larger scales of production.</i></p>

<p><i>In one quarter of the industries studied by one economist,
maximum technical efficiency could only be reached by a firm actually
producing more than that required to supply the total British market
[aircraft and diesel engines were two examples].</i> Large size also
allows advertising costs to be spread and better terms to be squeezed
out of suppliers of components or finance: these of course simply
constitute gains for the particular capitalists in relation to other
capitalists, rather than potential advantages of society in terms of
greater productivity. To fall behind in the race for size means,
therefore, that the firm has higher costs, lower profits, less to
plough back in more advanced equipment, yet higher costs, and so on
until it is swallowed up.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Competition?</h4>

<p class="fst">Some of the giant firms are more or less monopolies in the literal
sense of the word &#8211; that is they dominate the market for a
particular product. Information on this is hard to come by, but the
list of monopolised markets (<b>see chart A</b>) includes a large
number of basic commodities. The more usual situation, however, is
that a small number of firms produce a particular type of product.
The car industry is a classic case of what bourgeois economists call
&#8220;oligopolistic&#8221; competition, in which none of the small group of
producers has an overwhelming advantage. To take another example,
government statistics split up the electrical industry into 24
sub-sectors (TV sets, electric motors etc.) and on average the
largest 5 firms in each sub-sector capture over three quarters of the
sales. This does not mean, however, that there are more than 100
important firms in the industry &#8211; a giant like GEC operates in
nearly every sub-sector, and in fact the largest five firms in the
industry as a whole produce around two thirds of the total output of
the industry.</p>

<p class="sm1">In answer to a parliamentary question on April 6th, 1970 Edmund
Dell stated that no comprehensive list was available of industries
in which more than one half of the market was controlled by one
company or group, but that it was believed to be true of a list of
156 commodities including:</p>

<p class="fst">A pure monopolist can set as high a price as the market will bear,
but where there are a number of large firms competing, each one has
to take account of its rivals reactions. When times are good, and no
one firm has any particular advantage, there is tacit recognition
that they all gain by charging as high a price as possible. Of course
if they charge too much other firms will come into the industry and
undercut them. But even where there is little price competition, the
different firms will generally still fight for a bigger share of the
market through advertising, product changes etc. And as soon as one
of the firms gains a marked cost advantage, what was previously a
stable situation will be rapidly transformed as the firm tries to
exploit its technical advantage to drive out weaker rivals and
capture some of their market. Such &#8216;disruptive&#8217; behaviour also
intensifies in slumps when it becomes a matter of survival for a firm
to increase its market share in order to maintain sales and meet
fixed costs.</p>

<p>Competition takes place increasingly on an international, rather
than domestic scale. The tremendous capital accumulation in Japan and
Continental Europe relative to Britain, has been reflected in the
disastrous erosion of the market shares of British firms in the home
and export markets. With lower costs, based on the most advanced
techniques and therefore more efficient exploitation of the workers,
foreign producers have been able to undercut their British rivals,
forcing down prices and profits, reinforcing the vicious cycles of
low investment and growth. Of course, on occasions, the stifling of
competition through cartels operates on an international level as well:</p> 

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Groups of cable manufacturers in at least 20 countries
have been collaborating through a Liechtenstein registered
organisation, with an operational headquarters in London, to restrict
their competition in world markets. Export contracts offered by
customers have been secretly shared out at agreed minimum price
levels.</p>

<p class="quote">Under the aegis of the neutrally titled International
Cable Development Corporation, some British companies have recently
played a leading role in strengthening the confidential arrangements
for controlling competition. Tenders received from developing
countries have been subject to particular market-sharing controls.</p>

<p class="quote">A large contract for the supply of cables to Iran is
known to have gone to British interests after rival German cable
makers ceded their own offer in order to avoid needless competition
between ICDC members. Machinery for allocating exports was used to
settle who won the business ...</p>

<p class="quote">... Arrangements to which they were parties include the
sharing out of export tenders, collective negotiations of guidelines
for price quotations, and agreed methods for undermining competitors
not belonging to the ICDC.</p>

<p class="quote">London appears to be the nerve centre of a complex
network of manufacturers who have been staging regular committee
meetings in top hotels around Europe. Executives travel from as far
as Japan ...</p>

<p class="quote">... Last year, nearly two thirds of all export business
monitored by the organisation was conducted at what are known as
&#8220;tolerance&#8221; price levels. A <i>Guiding Price List</i> has been
used by member companies to deal with customers&#8217; orders.</p>

<p class="quote">Some 20 national groups of companies of companies are
expected to counter competition in their own home markets themselves.
But they can call in the international organisation if they require
help. Centrally determined procedures exist for stage-managing
competitive fights to undermine competition from outsiders...&#8221; (<b>The
Times</b>, 7/4/75)</p>

<p class="fst">Competition does not necessarily lead to the weaker firms being
bankrupted, through there have been spectacular examples in recent
years; the centralisation of capital has been enormously accelerated
by the merger boom. Since the mid fifties more than half the
companies whose shares were quoted on the London Stock Exchange have
been taken over through their shares being purchased by other, almost
invariably larger, firms. In the peak years for mergers, 1968, &#163;1,530
million was spent by manufacturing companies in buying up other
firms, as compared with &#163;1,590 [million] investment in new factories. Mergers
are also an important route for giant companies expanding into
different industries, when possibilities for growth in their own
markets are limited; in 1972, another year of intense merger
activity, more than half the mergers involved moves into another industry.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Ownership</h4>

<p class="fst">The legal owners of the giant firms are the shareholders. Whilst
there are around two million people in Britain who own shares, half
of the shares are held by the wealthiest &#188;% of the population,
according to the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Wealth
(<b>Report 1</b>, Table 31). Apologists for capitalism proclaim that there
has been a &#8216;managerial revolution&#8217; &#8211; that a diminishing
proportion of the major companies are actually run on a day to day
basis by major shareholders and that in a growing number of companies
there are no longer identifiable groups of families with a
controlling interest. As a result of this, they say, managers are no
longer interested in profits for their own sake and can rule
benevolently with an eye to the interests of workers and consumers.
These trends have in fact often been exaggerated; Burmah Oil &#8211; the
sixth biggest company in Britain in 1974 &#8211; is a good example of a
company which despite appearances is controlled by a small group:</p>

<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="6" border="6" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="smc"><big><b>LARGE SHAREHOLDERS IN BURMAH OIL</b></big></p>
<p class="smc"><i>Scottish Widows Funds and Life Assurance Society<br/>
Murray Johnstone managed investment trusts<br/>
Robert Fleming managed investment trusts<br/>
Save and Prosper unit trusts<br/>
Scotbits Securities unit trusts</i></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Scotbits Securities is a Scottish-based subsidiary of
Save and Prosper, the latter being jointly owned by Burmah&#8217;s two
merchant bankers &#8211; Robert Fleming&#8217;s and Barings &#8211; and by the
Bank of Scotland and Atlantic Assets Trust, the latter being managed
by Ivory and Sime. The Murray Johnstone trusts have had a long
association with Burmah &#8211; the company was founded by David Cargill
and developed under the chairmanship of his son, Sir John Cargill,
who was a chairman during the inter-war years of a number of trusts
managed by Brown, Fleming and Murray (the forerunner of the Murray
Johnstone group). The chairman of Burmah until 1974, now deputy
chairman, is also chairman of all the Murray Johnstone trusts.
Fleming&#8217;s Bank has long been associated with these same trusts
through the Fleming family&#8217;s association with the Murray family and
the large Scottish accountancy firm of Whinney, Murray, and the legal
firm of Maclay, Murray and Spens. Ivory and Sime manage the Scotbit
unit trusts, and through Atlantic Assets, have a large stake in Save
and Prosper. Scottish Widows Fund is interlocked through
directorships with the Murray Johnstone group (twice), the Fleming
trusts (twice), Save and Prosper (once) and Ivory and Sime (twice).
Finally, and strongest argument of all, Burmah&#8217;s board consists of
seven executive and six non-executive directors; of the latter, three
directors are also on Fleming&#8217;s trust, one is on Fleming&#8217;s bank,
one is on various Murray Johnstone trusts, one is on Scottish Widows,
and one is on the Bank of Scotland. Thus, the dominant proprietary
interests in Burmah are heavily interconnected through shareholdings,
directorships, management and other associations. The conclusion must
be that these groups <i>do</i> exercise influence over Burmah&#8217;s
operations ...&#8221; (<b>Sociology</b>, January 1976)<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Coercive Laws</h4>

<p class="fst">But in any case, capitalism throughout its history has been
dominated by pursuit of profit not because of the personal greed of
individual owners of firms, but because the competitive nature of the
system imposes this behaviour. As Marx pointed out:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The development of capitalist production makes it
constantly necessary to keep increasing the amount of capital laid
out in a given industrial undertaking and competition makes the
immanent laws of capitalist production to be felt by each individual
capitalist as external coercive laws. It compels him to keep
constantly extending his capital in order to preserve it, but extend
it he cannot except by means of progressive accumulation.&#8221;
(<b>Capital</b>, Vol.&nbsp;1)</p>

<p class="fst">This is just as true for the chief executive of a present day
company as it was of the traditional capitalist owner-entrepreneur.
Even if the directors and managers hold a minute proportion of the
company&#8217;s shares, their jobs, salary and prestige all ultimately
depend on the success of the company, which in turn requires
sufficient profits and investment. Similarly the position of the
directors of the banks, insurance companies and pension funds, which
together hold more than half the shares of industrial firms depend on
the success of the firms in which they invest. These financial
institutions are definitely in a position to ensure that their
interests are taken care of; in 1970 out of the largest 50 industrial
companies, 22 had directors of the clearing banks on their boards, 15
had directors of merchant banks and 18 had directors of insurance
companies. There are also numerous links through joint directorships
between the different financial institutions (<b>see chart B</b>).
The cohesion of the industrial and financial sectors is further
increased by links with the state &#8211; the top 50 industrial firms had
(in 1960) 9 directors of the Bank of England and 5 other nationalised
industries on their boards, whilst the big financial institutions had
5 directors of the Bank of England and 7 of other nationalised
industries &#8211; <i>No doubt highly useful as &#8216;channels of
information&#8217;.</i></p>

<p class="fst">This also refutes the idea of the &#8216;democratisation of capital&#8217;,
that nearly everyone now owns shares through their company pension or
TU pension fund or life insurance and that we live in a &#8216;property
owning&#8217; democracy. On the contrary, the tremendous centralisation
of productive capital in larger and large plants has been paralleled
by the centralisation of control over these resources in the hands of
the group of directors, chief executives and major shareholders,
numbering a few thousand, who control the major companies.</p>

<p class="fst">The activities of the Monopolies Commission, which occasionally
publicises the most extortionate uses of <i>particular</i> monopoly
power, as in the recent investigations of tranquilisers and
contraceptives, and even achieves some concessions, serve mainly to
divert attention from the <i>general</i> situation of monopoly
control which they never consider.</p>

<p class="fst">These figures do overestimate the dominance of the largest
companies over the total of all companies, in that the top 1000
excludes a host of &#8216;small&#8217; firms (turnover less than &#163;13&#189;
million); the only estimate available suggests that the largest 200
manufacturing companies produce about 60% of total manufacturing
output, as compared with the higher figures quoted above. Yet the 80%
figure is more indicative of the power of the giant companies, and
the extent of control that nationalisation of them would give. In
fact it may well understate the degree of control even for industries
where small firms predominate. For many of the smaller firms, both
these included in the 1,000, and the smaller ones, as well, are
basically component suppliers to, or retailers for, the firms
included in the top 200. They are completely dependent upon them for
markets. The large firms may well find it more profitable to use
their monopoly power to force down their suppliers&#8217; prices rather
than produce the same goods themselves.</p>

<p>Control of the motor industry (all of which is effectively
included in the top 200) would enable planning to be extended
immediately to the smaller engineering firms supplying components
(the larger firms like Dunlops, Lucas, Smiths, GKN are included in
the top 200), and also would allow control to be extended to the
smaller car distributors. Similarly ownership of the great chain
stores would allow effective government control of numerous small
producers of consumer goods (Marks and Spencers already has the
reputation for doing this in the case of many textile suppliers) even
without their immediate nationalisation. Again nationalisation of the
top 200, plus those industries already nationalised, would give
control over virtually all the major inputs of fuel, metal, chemicals
etc, and this could be used to bring smaller firms into conformity
with the requirements of a socialist plan of production.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>

<p class="fst"><i>Finally there is control of finance; at the end of 1974 there
were 25 financial institutions [excluding insurance companies] each
with capital in excess of &#163;500 million and in total they controlled
&#163;72 billion or more than 87&#190;% of the assets of the top 100
financial institutions.</i> Nationalisation of these 25, plus the
biggest 10 insurance companies which compromise around two thirds of
the insurance industry, would give the government effective control
over the credit system. This could also be used to direct the firms
which would not immediately be taken over.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Potential</h4>

<p class="fst">Obviously, however, it would be absurd to simply nationalise the
top 200 in a mechanical fashion; the London Brick Company which lies
just outside the 200 is obviously of more central importance to a
socialist plan than is the Nestl&#233; company or Consolidated Gold
Fields (which operates mainly in South Africa). The list of priority
companies to be nationalised would have to be drawn up on the basis
of detailed information on the different industries.</p>

<p>The biggest 65 overseas investors, almost all of which are in the
top 200, owned almost two-thirds of UK foreign investment, worth
about &#163;4,000 [million] at the end of 1971 (even excluding the oil companies
assets). The way in which these assets would be used, and the 26 of
the 200 companies owned overseas (mostly the USA) would be
controlled, would obviously depend on the international circumstances
surrounding the socialist transformation of Britain. But it is clear
that nationalisation of 200 top companies, plus the 35 leading
financial institutions, would give a workers&#8217; government the
control over the economic system. Only then would the tremendous
centralisation of production which the dominance of the monopolies
under capitalism has developed, be used for the benefit of society.</p>
