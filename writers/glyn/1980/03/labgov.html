<p class="fst"><strong>In a previous issue of <em>Militant</em> [29 February] Andrew
Glyn reviewed a Fabian pamphlet on the 1974&#8211;79 Labour
government. In this article, he looks at the arguments contained
in <em>What went wrong?</em> edited by Ken Coates [Spokesman Books
&#163;2.95]</strong></p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<br/>
<p class="fst">The Fabian pamphlet provided a wealth of information on how the
Labour government, despite some achievements, failed completely to
bring about a fundamental shift in the balance of power and wealth in
favour of working people and their families as promised in the 1974 manifesto.</p>

<p>In fact as it showed, living standards for working people fell
over this period. The Fabian writers totally failed though to explain
why a Labour government should so diligently carry out the dictates
of the ruling class.</p>

<p>The Spokesman volume, representing generally a Tribunite position,
does not really advance the argument that much further.</p>

<p>Francis Cripps and Frances Morrell (Tony Benn&#8217;s advisers) make
the extraordinary statement that if only the Labour government had
been prepared to break with the EEC &#8220;they would then have been free
to implement Labour&#8217;s re-nationalisation programme, control excess
imports by trade agreements and maintain full employment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The absurdity of this obsession with the EEC should have been
clear from Tom Forrester&#8217;s article on industrial strategy, in which
he points out that even the top civil servant in the Department of
Trade admitted that Labour&#8217;s plans had to be modified &#8220;because of
intense hostility from industry.&#8221; (Readers of Forrester&#8217;s
notorious mole-baiting article in <strong>New Society</strong> will be
surprised to learn he can actually put together an article not
composed entirely of gossip.)<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Low profitability</h4>

<p class="fst">Michael Barratt Brown says the decline in British industry can be
attributed &#8220;directly to the outflow of industrial and finance
capital&#8221; which meant that &#8220;the wealth generated in Britain has
been siphoned out to the main centres of capital accumulation, above
all inside the EEC.&#8221; He ignores the fact that private investment
overseas, even at its peak of &#163;3 billion in 1978, was actually less
than profits earned abroad, so in no sense represented a siphoning
off of wealth created in the UK.</p>

<p>As he himself emphasises it was low profitability and lack of a
docile labour force which explained low UK investment.</p>

<p>Michael Meacher points out the links between the civil servants
and industry (between 1974 and 1977 26 civil servants of Permanent
Secretary level were recruited by private firms), and explains how
civil servants can obstruct a minister attempting to implement party
policy (a theme also taken up by Tony Been recently).</p>

<p>But what good would more sympathetic civil servants have been to
Benn, when Wilson, as prime minister, had accepted that</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Private industry must have the necessary confidence to maintain and increase
investment. And confidence demands that a clear frontier be defined
between what is public and what is private industry&#8221;?</p>

<p class="fst">While the authors accept that it was pressure from the capitalists
that forced the government to retreat, the discussion of how a future
Labour government could defeat the pressure is quite inadequate. Of
course, control by the PLP is essential (and Geoff Bish gives a
graphic description of how the NEC was outmanoeuvred by Callaghan
over the 1979 Manifesto).<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Labour&#8217;s programme</h4>

<p class="fst">But there is very little analysis in the book of whether Labour&#8217;s
programme was adequate in the first place, of whether it is in fact
possible for a Labour government to control the economy while leaving
the overwhelming majority of the means of production in private hands.</p>

<p>Stuart Holland correctly emphasises that no serious attempt was
made to implement Labour&#8217;s programme but that does not mean that
all that is necessary is to repeat the demands of the Alternative
Economic Strategy without reassessing if they are feasible in the
light of the experience of the last Labour government.</p>

<p>It is also indicative of a narrow parliamentary view to say
&#8220;without the accountability of government to parliament and
parliament to the Party, there is little chance of reversing the
dominance of capital over labour in class relations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holland does not appear to recognise that any attempt to break the
power of private capital could only be based on a mass mobilisation
of the labour movement, a condition a hundred times more important
than the views of civil servants, the integrity of parliamentary
leaders, or the rights of backbench MPs.</p>

<p>Whether the Alternative Economic Strategy put forward by the
parliamentary left is adequate, how to achieve the active support
necessary to carry through a socialist programme, these should be the
central questions raised in the minds of the activists by the
experience of the 1974&#8211;79 government.</p>
