<p class="fst"><em><strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme for Britain</strong> [1972] pointed to the
&#8220;gross mal-distribution of wealth in Britain today&#8221; [page 21] and
said &#8220;we shall therefore introduce a wealth tax, consisting of an
annual levy on the large concentrations of private wealth.&#8221; As the
Government&#8217;s <strong>Green Paper</strong> explained it [in August 1974] &#8220;the
fundamental purpose of the wealth tax is to make the distribution of
the tax burden accord more closely with taxable capacity and thereby
contribute to the creation of a more equitable society in which
social divisions characterised by differences of wealth are reduced
and in which social and economic power created by the possession of
wealth is less concentrated than at present.&#8221; [page 20]</em></p>
<p>Up to date figures provided by the Royal Commission on the
distribution of income and wealth give some indication of present
degrees of inequality. In 1972 the top 1% of income receivers got 6%
of total pre-tax income and the top 5% got 17% (<strong>1st Report</strong>,
Table 15). Nor does taxation at the present do much to reduce the
share of the best off; as the report says (paragraph 150) &#8220;the
effect of all taxes on the distribution is small, with the
progressive effect of direct taxes (income tax, national insurance
contributions) ... largely offset by the regressive nature of
indirect taxes (on commodities).&#8221; Since so many people have
virtually no wealth at all the degree of inequality in this respect
is even greater than for incomes. The Royal Commission calculated
that in 1974 the top 1% and 5% of the population held roughly one
quarter and one half respectively of total personal wealth (Table
49).</p>
<p>Of course the apologists of capitalism point to the fact that
there has been some reduction in the degree of inequality (for
example the richest 5% probably held around two thirds of total
wealth in 1960 &#8211; Table 45). But this has been <em>largely due to the
spread of ownership of consumer durables, like cars and houses, as
workers secured some improvement in their living standards [by 1973
these items accounted for more than one half of personal wealth]</em>.
The rise in house prices, and fall in share prices, have reduced the
value of ordinary shares, which represent control over the key
sections of British capital, to not much more than 5% of total
personal wealth &#8211; a sure indicator of the declining fortunes of
industrial capital. But of course it is this section which is
decisive for controlling the whole economic system and ordinary
shares are unequally distributed as ever &#8211; the top 0.6% of wealth
owners held 54% of privately held ordinary shares in 1973 (Table 31)
and the proportion of land they hold is greater still.</p>
<p>The Green Paper of 1974 proposed a wealth tax with rates beginning
at 1% on wealth in excess of £100,000 rising to either 2&#0189;% or 5% on
wealth in excess of £5 million. (Labour&#8217;s Programme had talked of
£50,000 being the lower limit and inflation could not justify
doubling the exemption level). The question was referred to a Select
Committee of the Commons to &#8220;hear the views of those directly
affected and of anybody else.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>CBI pressure</h4>
<p class="fst">The views of those &#8216;directly affected&#8217; came in thick and fast,
taking up well over one thousand pages. The CBI described the
proposals as &#8220;confiscatory&#8221; because &#8220;the combined burden of
income and wealth tax could, after allowing a reasonable margin&nbsp;(!)
for living expenses, exceed the net income of the tax payer in a
single year, forcing a sale of assets.&#8221; (As though this was not
precisely what a tax aimed at reducing private holding of wealth
would have to do). The CBI proposed that income plus wealth tax
should not take more than 70% of income. They tried to frighten the
Committee with a horror story of how the owner of a business worth £&#0189;
million could find himself after 35 years owing more in deferred
wealth tax than his business was worth. The Inland Revenue pointed
out, that with less ludicrous assumptions than the CBI&#8217;s, he would
have £900,000 left. The City Tax Committee warned that without a
ceiling &#8220;the flow of money and able executives out of the country
will continue.&#8221; The Institute of Directors called it an &#8220;oppressive
and inequitable tax.&#8221; The Stock Exchange thought that &#8220;abiding
damage could be inflicted on the delicate balance of the mixed
economy ... The Government seeks to increase investment in industry,
but it is effectively prohibiting the flow of capital through the
Stock Market by the existing and proposed taxation policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps it is not surprising that the Committee wilted under this
pressure. The Chairman&#8217;s draft, meant to represent some kind of
balance between the views of the Committee, <em>but not adopted due to
the absences of two Labour members,</em> proposed a string of
concessions as compared with the Green Paper &#8211; on forestry, works
of art, aggregation of husbands&#8217; and wives&#8217; incomes, limiting tax
for owners of businesses, the starting rate (&#0189;% was suggested). It
was even argued that the revenue should be used &#8220;for the reduction
of the high rates of tax on earned income.&#8221; (So that effectively
some wealth owners would pay more tax while directors and managers
with &#8216;earned&#8217; income would pay less). <em>The Labour members&#8217;
own report contained many of these concessions in less extreme form,
while Maurice MacMillan&#8217;s followed even more closely the promptings
of big business, and only Jeremy Bray stuck out for more or less the
<strong>Green Paper</strong> proposals.</em></p>
<p>The <strong>Financial Times</strong> reported (December 11th) that &#8220;it now
seems unlikely that the Government will take early action to
introduce the tax in any form,&#8221; mentioning &#8220;the small sum at
stake (£100&#8211;£200 million on Douglas Jay&#8217;s draft as compared
with £300&#8211;£400 million on the stiffer Green Paper set of rates)
the possible effect on business confidence and the administrative
problems involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously this is a particularly transparent case of the Labour
Government yielding to the pressure of big business, and the Labour
Movement should demand that the Government implements a wealth tax
along with the other measures in its programme. But it would be
wrong, now that the prospect of early action has receded, to foster
any illusion that the implementation of the Green Paper proposals
would have fundamentally changed British society.</p>
<p>The Labour Party has not been contemplating a wealth tax
sufficiently sweeping to force the capitalist class to hand over its
shares to the Government, and if it did their response to the modest
Green Paper proposals would be as nothing to what would follow. In
any case if the objective is, as it should be, to remove power from
the owners of industry there is nothing to be said for even a
punitive wealth tax, which would take many years to have this effect.
A programme of nationalisation with compensation according to need
would give much less time for opposition to be mounted and the
economy to be disrupted and is therefore a much more effective alternative.</p>
