<p class="fst"><strong>The <em>White Paper on Public Expenditure</em> up to 1978&#8211;79
gives the clearest indication so far of thoroughly capitalist
economic perspective offered by the Labour Government.</strong></p>
<p>The most dramatic figure is the Treasury&#8217;s estimate that, even
if the economy grows at 2&#0189;% per year between 1973 and 1979, then the
living standards of employed workers can only be allowed to grow at
less than &#0189;% per year.</p>
<p>If growth in production is less than 2&#0189;% p.a., and even the
Treasury (though they &#8220;hope&#8221; growth will be faster) admits the
possibility of this given &#8220;world conditions&#8221;, then a sustained
fall in living standards would be necessary.</p>
<p>But what are the other claims on production which require living
standards to grow so much slower than output as a whole? First there
is the &#8220;balance of payments&#8221;. The White Paper budgets for almost
one fifth of extra production to be devoted to plugging the deficit
through higher exports.</p>
<p>Even though this would barely eliminate the &#8220;non-oil&#8221; deficit,
still leaving the extra cost of oil to be dealt with later, the
necessary increase in exports would certainly require further devaluation.</p>
<p>Capitalists hope that the extra profits from higher prices for
exports, and for production sold at home will finance the 5% p.a.
increase in private investment in factories, machine tools etc. which
the White Paper regards as essential.</p>
<p>But given workers&#8217; resistance to having their living standards
eroded much of the extra cash would probably have to come through
higher taxation on workers, which is then funnelled to the
capitalists, through more lavish investment incentives or via the NEB.</p>
<p><em>In actual fact, nothing is included in the estimates for
Labour&#8217;s nationalisation proposals on the grounds that the policies
have not yet been fully worked out! </em>While pointing out (quite
correctly) that nationalising existing assets does not cost anything
in terms of current production used up, the Treasury mutters darkly
that the speed at which such policies can be developed <em>&#8220;must pay
full regard to general financial conditions in the country&#8221;</em> (page 126).</p>
<p>Labour is, in effect, being warned by the Treasury mandarins,
orthodox servants of Big Business to a man, of possible chaos in the
financial markets if it carries out its programme! But the way to
avoid such chaos is not to hold back on nationalisation but to extend
it to the financial system itself, and to limit compensation to cases
of need (for, ironically, it is extra governmental bonds issued to
compensate the capitalists which are <em>supposed</em> to cause the
chaos which the Treasury imagines would result from nationalisation!)</p>
<p>Set beside the planned expansion in exports and investment, at
least the 2.8%&nbsp;p.a. growth of public expenditure on the surface looks
hopeful. Obviously every socialist would welcome the fact that
pensions are budgeted to rise in real terms by about 3%&nbsp;p.a. up to
1978. (But there is a ready made excuse for going back on this later,
since the commitment is to keep pensions growing in line with real
earnings which are supposed to stay nearly constant.)</p>
<p>But in any case, there is virtually nothing in the programme for
the average employed worker. Investment in new housing and
improvements are expected to fall by £230 million between 1974 and
1978; school building to fall to less than half the 1972 level, and
hospital building to only three-quarters the 1972 level.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the rise of nearly £300m between 1974 and 1978
in defence expenditure (even after cuts); of £160m in spending on
&#8220;Law, Order and Protective Services&#8221;, another £160 million in
extra &#8220;incentives&#8221; to capitalists for investment in the regions,
and with the tenfold increase to £310 million in the net
contribution to the EEC housing budget. Even the £300 million
increases in housing subsidies will be more than offset by the
reduction of subsidies on food and on the huge increase in cost of
products and services which workers buy from nationalised industries.</p>
<p>All this shows the hollowness of Len Murray&#8217;s plea that unions
should not compensate for higher taxation which is <em>&#8220;needed to
pay for essential spending ... and is part of our collective living
standards.&#8221;</em> (<strong>Times</strong>, 22/1/75)</p>
<p>In fact, the Government has produced a thoroughly capitalist plan
for the economy with take home pay and public services held down, and
in many cases cut, in order to (hopefully!) permit an increase of one
third in the capitalist&#8217;s rate of investment.</p>
<p>Only with the Labour movement in control of the economy can the
real problem of sorting out priorities for future spending, between
take-home pay, public services and investment be tackled in the
interests of the mass of the people.</p>
