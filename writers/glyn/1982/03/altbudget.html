<p class="fst"><i>Workers in their millions, including many who were &#8216;conned&#8217;
into voting Tory in 1979, have been made bitterly angry by Thatcher&#8217;s policies.</i></p>

<p><i>Cuts in living standards generally, in health, in education,
but above all the monstrous rise in unemployment have all added
greatly to the unpopularity of the government.</i></p>

<p>But to win mass support at the next election, the Labour Party
itself must have a convincing programme to deal with the economy and
especially with unemployment.</p>

<p>The focus on economic policy after the Budget provides an
excellent opportunity to explain Labour&#8217;s alternative. And compared
to Sir Geoffrey Howe&#8217;s studied complacency in the face of havoc his
policies are causing, the proposals put forward by Labour last week
at least have an encouraging optimism about them.</p>

<p>The policy gives priority to overcoming unemployment and creating
new growth in the economy, things that all workers would welcome
after years of Tory-induced recession. But in relation to the drastic
situation in the economy, the objectives of creating only 500,000
jobs a year and a 5 per cent growth rate are wholly inadequate, and,
given the whole logic of the policy, confining the strategy within a
capitalist framework, they are utopian in any case.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s modest target to reduce dole queues to 1 million in the
five years looks hopelessly inadequate when the hidden unemployed and
the increase in the workforce are taken into account.</p>

<p>Unemployment was only 235,000 in 1955 and only 70,000 in 1944.
Labour should set itself the goal of reducing unemployment to at
least these sort of levels. <i>Between 1945 and 1948 three million
new jobs were created. The same rate of job expansion &#8211; a million a
year for five years &#8211; has to be the basis of Labour&#8217;s policy; and
bold socialist policies have to be adopted to make sure it is possible.</i></p>

<p>But far from securing the required 5 million extra jobs, it is
highly unlikely that the plans recently detailed by Peter Shore would
yield the 2&#189; million he hopes for.</p>

<p>Indeed in broad outline the plans bear an uncanny resemblance to
the last great Keynesian package, launched by Tory Chancellor Tony
Barber just 10 years ago in April 1972</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shore proposes to increase public spending by &#163;4&#189;
	billion; Barber increased spending by &#163;4&#189; billion at today&#8217;s
	prices.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li>Shore proposes tax cust of &#163;4&#189; billion; Barber cut taxes
	by &#163;1.8 billion, equivalent to &#163;7 billion now.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li>Shore calls for a &#8220;more realistic level of the exchange
	rate&#8221; (that is a fall in the value of the pound); Barber said that
	&#8220;an unrealistic exchange rate&#8221; would not be allowed to frustrate
	his determination to reduce unemployment.</li>
</ul>

<p class="fst">After Barber&#8217;s package, production did actually grow at 6 per
cent a year, faster than Shore&#8217;s 5 per cent target. But the pace of
expansion could not be maintained despite a massive increase in the
budget deficit. Inflation rose in two years &#8217;72 to &#8217;74 from 6% to
24%.</p>

<p>Furthermore, instead of ploughing back their increased profits
into investment in manufacturing industry, which would maintain or
improve competitiveness on world markets, cash poured into office
blocks, stocks of commodities, indeed anything which promised a
faster return than producing real wealth. Little more than a year
after the &#8216;give-away&#8217; budget the growth in production had ground
to a halt.</p>

<p>In the present situation, it is doubtful if the same pace of
expansion could be maintained even for as long as under Barber. The
first, and most crucial, point, is that the capitalist class were
wholly behind Barber&#8217;s policies but they are implacably opposed to
Labour&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Early in 1972 they had just received their first drubbing at the
hands of the miners. The attempt to hold down wages by means of mass
unemployment (at that time one million unemployed was regarded as
mass unemployment) had collapsed and capitalism sought salvation in a
reflationary boom.</p>

<p>The collapse of the boom, with the crisis in secondary banking,
caused a torrent of recrimination to be heaped on the head of the
luckless Barber.</p>

<p>It was precisely the experience of those years that explained the
wholesale conversion of the City and much of industry to hardline
monetarism. The City would now totally reject Labour&#8217;s plan.</p>
<p>Far from pursuing the Tory strategy of pulling public sector
borrowing down Peter Shore would push it up by &#163;5&#189; billion in one
year, with presumably more to come the year after and the year after
that. But the strategy has not a word to say about how the big City
institutions will be persuaded to lend all this money to the government.</p>

<p>No one can have faith in the &#8216;negotiations&#8217; mentioned in this
connection by the NEC&#8217;s statement <i>The Socialist Alternative</i>,
because it is not only the total size of Shore&#8217;s package, but its
shape which will antagonise the finances.</p>

<p>Peter Shore has correctly called for exchange controls &#8220;to keep
capital at home.&#8221; But keeping &#8220;capital at home&#8221; does not mean
that it will be lent to the government.</p>

<p>He also proposes to raise an extra &#163;1 billion in taxation of top
incomes. But doctoring a growing PSBR in this way will only enrage
the City all the more and speed up the financial sabotage of
government plans.</p>

<p>Peter Shore&#8217;s plan includes chunks of the CBI&#8217;s programme; he
calls for the abolition of the National Insurance Surcharge, an
increase of government capital spending, as well as a lower interest
rate. But the CBI sees these as part of an overall package of reduced
government intervention.</p>

<p>Shore&#8217;s plan to offset some of the Tories&#8217; cuts with &#163;2&#189;
billion extra current spending on restoring the social services and
the value of welfare benefits, is anathema to the CBI just as much as
to the City. The CBI in fact wants cuts in this area to the tune of
&#163;1&#189; billion. With their rate of profit at only 2 per cent &#8211; a
quarter of the level at the time of Barber&#8217;s boom &#8211; the chances
of business being launch onto a substantial boom are negligible. They
will not invest in any case where so much capacity is unused &#8211;
about 20% in industry overall.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the reported statements of Peter Shore to
indicate what measures he would propose as Chancellor to force
employers to comply with Labour&#8217;s priorities.</p>

<p><b>Militant</b> has consistently argued that Labour conference
policies themselves are not sufficiently strong in this respect and
that substantially further nationalisation is required. But there is
no mention of these policies at all in Labour&#8217;s strategy. <i>The
logic of the policy is yet another attempt to push the socialist
content of Labour&#8217;s programme to one side, on the pretext that it
is necessary first to get the economy right.</i></p>

<p>Most alarming of all is what has now become a clear statement that
Shore and the other Labour leaders foresee involving the trade unions
once again in a new &#8220;Social Contract.&#8221; Despite all the
experiences of 1974&#8211;79 the Labour leaders are canvassing again for an
incomes policy.</p>

<p>The hope that economic expansion would not increase inflation by
any more than 2&#189;%, is also distinctly optimistic if a major fall in
the exchange rate is contemplated. Peter Shore indicated his
&#8220;continuing strategy for cost restraint in the second and
subsequent years ... necessarily included a national economic
assessment, in which the trade union movement is closely involved
with government, on the use of resources and the share of the
nation&#8217;s income ... which would go to profits, earnings and other
forms of income.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pressure to restore profits from the CBI will be enormous. To
meet the CBI&#8217;s target of 10% for the rate of profit, the first 20%
increase of production would have to go to profits.</p>

<p>There is no way that a &#8220;national economic assessment&#8221; can
reconcile the demands of workers, enthused by Labour&#8217;s victory, to
restore their living standards and the welfare state, with the
dictates of capital for vastly higher profits.</p>

<p>Enormous pressure &#8211; in reality economic blackmail &#8211; would be
used by big business and the finance houses to push a Labour
government into seeing the &#8216;right priorities&#8217; in their economic
assessment. Otherwise, they would sabotage the government through a
strike of investment, massive factory closures and capital movements.</p>

<p>If the basis of Labour&#8217;s appeal to workers in the next election
is the conquest of unemployment and other social ills &#8211; and that
without doubt is the feeling of Labour Party members &#8211; then bold
socialist policies would have to be adopted in the economic sphere.</p>

<p>Labour should explain that a Labour government would have to take
over the commanding heights of the economy &#8211; the 200 or so
industrial companies, banks, insurance and finance companies that
dominate the wealth of the country. A genuine National Plan for
economic recovery can only be based on genuine control of the wealth
and resources of the economy and their democratic management and
running in the interests of all.</p>

<p>Labour must fight for a clear alternative to the misery and chaos
of capitalism. But workers will not be inspired by the call for more
sacrifice &#8211; even if it is dressed up as a new Social Contract. The
call must go out for a fundamental change in society, as the only way
to give workers a future.</p>
