<br />
<p class="fst"><em>SIX MONTHS after announcing an austerity policy, the PASOK
(Socialist) government of Greece suddenly decided in mid-March to
invite the two Communist parties, as well as three small liberal
parties, to begin a &#8220;national dialogue&#8221; on foreign, economic and
social policies.</em></p>

<p>An invitation for discussions was also sent to two right-wing
parties, but this was immediately turned down.</p>

<p>The press hailed this as a brilliant move by Socialist prime
minister A. Papandreou to embarrass his opponents and regain the
initiative after the recent period of turmoil provoked by his
austerity measures.</p>

<p><em>In reality the last months have marked a decisive turn into a
new period of immense uncertainty and instability.</em></p>

<p>Behind this &#8220;initiative&#8221; lie the fears of PASOK&#8217;s leadership
about the catastrophic crisis of Greek capitalism and the bosses&#8217;
need for further unpopular measures, continuing opposition to those
measures, and the serious crisis in Pasok itself.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Serious struggles looming ahead</h4>

<p class="fst">The drops in the price of oil, in interest rates and the value of
the dollar could save the Greek economy almost $1 billion in 1986,
and possibly offset the inflationary effects of devaluation.</p>
<p>However, the outlook is not at all rosy. Interest payments on the
enormous foreign debt of $12&#8211;$15 billion alone will cost $1 billion
this year. It is estimated that Gross National Product may drop by 4
per cent. Private and public investment will probably decrease by 26
per cent and 15 per cent respectively, and unemployment will grow
from 8.5 per cent to 11 per cent.</p>

<p>The government itself hopes for, at best, no growth, 18 per cent
inflation, and a balance of payments deficit of $1.7&#8211;2 billion. And
all this in a period of relative upswing in the world economy!</p>

<p>Such is the collapse of confidence of the Greek bourgeoisie that
the bourgeois ex-President Karamanlis recently blurted out: &#8220;Only
PASOK and A. Papandreou can now take the measures to modernise the
economy and re-establish normal relations with the USA&#8221;.</p>

<p>The power and determination of the working class to break with
capitalism was again the major factor influencing events in the last
period. Two near general strikes in the space of two weeks last
October, a semi-general strike in February, and major strikes in
March have so far been the workers&#8217; answer to the government&#8217;s
austerity policy. (See <strong>Militant</strong>, 7 March)</p>

<p><em>In a period of deep crisis, workers realise that only major
struggles for major goals can change their lives. Small-scale or
isolated struggles, with limited aims, cannot enthuse the working
class. Even when such a strike is successful, the bosses quickly take
back with the right hand what they were forced to give with the left.</em></p>

<p>The workers&#8217; leadership, however, do not want to understand
these simple facts. The Communist parties and left Socialist trade
union leaders have, again and again, had to be forced to fight by the
sheer pressure of their rank and file.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not against private enterprise. We are not against
profits and even certain super-profits, but only against the
super-super-profits of the monopolies,&#8221; stated the leaders of the
pro-Moscow CP at the very moment that their members were calling for struggle.</p>

<p>As a result, the workers have had to fight not only without
leadership, but against it. So naturally after these battles and
without clear perspectives, some tiredness is creeping in among
certain sections of workers.</p>

<p>At the same time, new layers of the class, as well as the youth
and peasants, are joining the struggle.</p>

<p>Universities, technical colleges and high schools were closed down
in March with national, regional and local strikes against youth
unemployment and cuts in education.</p>

<p>Peasant associations are also mobilising. After three years of
almost continuous growth of their income through EEC and government
hand-outs, this year will be different.</p>

<p>The EEC decided on an average price increase of only 11 per cent
for Greek agricultural products, while inflation is around 20 per
cent. The government is also cutting back rapidly on subsidies.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Leadership</h4>

<p class="fst">Even the employees of the Greek Secret Service threatened to go on
strike, demanding demilitarisation of the service! Members of the
riot police told the press that they do not want to be used any more
against strikes or demonstrations.</p>

<p>The mood of the workers was shown on 26 March when 50,000
demonstrated in Athens, at a moment&#8217;s notice, against the US attack
on Libya.</p>

<p>An important step forward was taken when <strong>Xekinima</strong> (Marxist
paper in PASOK) called a conference of union representatives from
&#8220;problematic factories&#8221; (many of which were nationalised by
PASOK, but are now on the verge of collapse under the burden of
enormous debts accumulated by the former owners).</p>

<p><em>Under the threat of &#8220;modernisation&#8221; by the government &#8211;
which will mean closures and redundancies &#8211; representatives of 40
factories employing 30,000 workers took part. They accepted the
programme and united action proposed by the Marxist trade union
leaders, and elected a committee.</em></p>

<p>On 27 March, a five-hour stoppage was organised, with tremendous
success throughout the country. There was 100 per cent participation
in all major &#8220;problematic&#8221; factories, and a militant rally in
Athens attracted about 10,000 workers.</p>

<p>The main slogans were: &#8220;The workers in the factories, the bosses
on the dole&#8221;; &#8220;Nationalisation is here to stay&#8221;, etc.</p>

<p><em>This success was only possible because a socialist programme
was adopted, calling for the nationalisation of all major branches of
industry under workers&#8217; control. The workers were enthused because
united action was organised, with a campaign that took the issues to
every factory.</em></p>

<p>PASOK has been shaken again and again, from top to bottom, by the
struggles of the last few months.</p>

<p>A conference called by the recently expelled trade union leaders
of PASOK and former Central Committee members attracted 1,400 trade
unionists, youth and local party members, despite threats of expulsion.</p>

<p>At the meeting, the policies and undemocratic manoeuvres of the
leadership were decisively opposed by the rank and file, led by the
Marxists. A call for the formation of a new party was defeated, while
the formation of a trade union &#8216;broad left&#8217; (to be called the
Socialist Workers&#8217; Union Movement &#8211; SWUM) was overwhelmingly carried.</p>

<p>The struggle within PASOK is continuing, despite the expulsion of
leading left-wingers and the mistaken resignation of others. The
major forces of the left rank and file remain within the party.</p>

<p>In a recent conference of PASOK trade unionists the leadership was
decisively opposed and a few party hacks were shouted down. When the
bureaucrats attacked <strong>Xekinima</strong>, delegates shouted: &#8220;They have
done very well!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same time, recent elections in the trade unions prove that
PASOK still enjoys tremendous support among the workers. This shows
that the Marxists were correct when campaigning against a new party,
in favour of fighting to win PASOK to a socialist programme.</p>

<p>Not only PASOK but both the CPs are in crisis. The leadership of
the pro-Moscow CP has been forced to expel whole sections of the
party in the Federation of Hospital Workers and in their youth section.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that the only tendency in the
workers&#8217; movement which is growing in influence and support is the
Marxist opposition in PASOK.</p>

<p>The leadership of PASOK is facing two major challenges in 1986.
One is the trade union conference, with the election of a new
leadership. The other is the local elections next autumn.</p>

<p>The strongly pro-government trade union leadership (appointed by
the court after the expulsion of their predecessors) is already
involved in secret deals to secure re-election. The government is
already trying to minimise the possibility of defeat in the local elections.</p>

<p>The bourgeois parties, on the other hand, are not at all eager to
challenge PASOK and risk stirring up the workers. However, the ruling
class has not abandoned the struggle. It is pressuring Papandreou to
do more dirty work for them, so that they can attack when the
workers&#8217; movement weakens and bring the government down.</p>

<p>Papandreou, glimpsing the defeat which he himself is preparing,
hopes to play it like Mitterrand. He plans to move to the presidency
in 1989, or before and change to proportional representation so that
the right cannot form a majority government.</p>

<p>But the defeat of the ruling class will not be achieved by clever
parliamentary manoeuvres. Only united class struggle for power on a
socialist programme will smash the reaction. With Marxist leadership,
the rank and file of PASOK, the workers and youth can transform the
party into a fighting organisation that will carry through this task.</p>
