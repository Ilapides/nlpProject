<p class="fst"><em>The narrow electoral accession of Karamanlis to the Presidency
reflects the growing polarisation of Greek society. Only 183 MPs
voted for him in the final ballot. As his own party had 174 MPs, this
means he only got 9 voted from the smaller opposition parties.</em></p>

<p><em>Since last autumn, Greek capitalists have been faced with a
serious economic crisis, and a growing radicalisation of the working
class, the peasants and the youth, resulting in further erosion of
ND&#8217;s social support. This, combined with the threat that the left
party PASOK could win the next election forced the ruling class to
begin &#8216;preparing&#8217; Karamanlis for the presidency.</em></p>

<p>The result of the Presidential election reflects, in a distorted
way, the deep polarisation of society, the serious weakening of &#8216;New
Democracy&#8217; and the collapse of the &#8216;national image&#8217; of
Karamanlis himself. It is an expression of the radicalisation of the
working class, the peasants and all oppressed layers of society, who,
despite the lack of unity in their own ranks and despite temporary
defeats, still represent today an enormous potential power.</p>

<p>Despite the demand of both PASOK and pro-Moscow Communist Party
(KKE) for elections, so that the new President could be voted in by a
representative parliament, the capitalists worked to elect Karamanlis
to the presidency and to maintain ND in office. This was made
possible because the leaders of the workers&#8217; parties gave no lead
to the working class militants, and for months refrained from even
recognising the importance of this election for future developments.</p>

<p>No attempt was made to connect the struggle of workers and
peasants against wage restraint and the cuts in social expenditure
with the question of the Presidency and the semi-bonapartist
constitution, or to prepare a national struggle to oust the
right-wing government.</p>

<p>On the contrary, in the first three months of the year when the
workers, peasant youth, and even shopkeepers and local councils were
taking actions against the policies of ND, the leaders of the left
split these mobilisations into unco-ordinated attacks which, despite
the determination of the strikes, led them eventually into
frustration and temporary defeat.</p>

<p>The Bank workers&#8217; strike, the most important of these
mobilisations, defied the courts and terrified the government and
ended after 35 days of national struggle with a compromise, because
the workers&#8217; parties supported it only with &#8220;messages of solidarity&#8221;.</p>

<p>As a result, after making a few concessions on the side to the
most powerful unions, the government has managed, albeit with
difficulty, to impose its wages policy of 11&#8211;15% increases. This,
when inflation is increasing at a rate of 24%. It also refused to
give in to the demands of the peasants or the local councils.</p>

<p>The KKE leaders maintained that all the hue and cry in the
capitalist press about the Presidential election was intended to
distract the workers from their immediate problems and demands. So it
was not until a few days before the vote that the KKE daily paper
suddenly called for parliamentary elections on the grounds that the
constitution gives the President autocratic powers.</p>

<p>Andreas Papandreou (leader of PASOK) did not make clear his
party&#8217;s position, and even allowed leading members of its central
committee to maintain publicly that Karamanlis in the Presidency
would only be a tame figurehead. Not until March did PASOK&#8217;s
leadership decide to oppose Karamanlis, stating that this parliament
should not elect the new President because it was no longer
representative, and demanded new elections. PASOK mentioned that in
1975 they did not vote for the constitution and had called for a
constituent assembly.</p>

<p>These decisions created fury among the capitalists, who were
counting on the support of the right-wing of PASOK. However, even
then no action was taken in order to actually mobilise the workers
and force the government to hold elections.</p>

<p>Both PASOK and the KKE once again limited their opposition to
within parliament. Eventually they simply abstained, without even
proposing any alternative candidate. This was at a time when a common
candidate of the left could have been a symbol of unity in action,
and a starting point for a co-ordinated campaign to oust the
right-wing government and to prepare the way for a government of
PASOK-KKE, and for a constituent assembly to vote in a socialist constitution.</p>

<p>The Greek economy is already in the middle of a new crisis. The
GNP is expected to have zero growth this year (3.5% in &#8217;79),
industrial production is declining fast (6% increase in &#8217;79), and
agricultural production has remained stagnant for the last five years.</p>

<p>Investment in industry is at the same level as in 1973. The
balance of payments problem has reached critical proportions as the
deficit in 1980 is expected to be between $2.5&#8211;3 billion, whilst
the real value of the drachma is falling lower and lower, with a 15%
drop in the last four months alone.</p>

<p>The government, under pressure from the capitalists and the IMF
and EEC, is trying hard to deflate the economy further, hoping to
lower inflation and cut imports. The bankers are asking for higher
interest rates, the industrialists for more grants and concessions,
and both of them demand wage restraint and reductions in state
expenditure. The capitalists are now facing a serious dilemma; how to
impose harsher policies with an even weaker government.</p>

<p>The most probable course they will now follow is to reshuffle the
government and try to stick it out, hoping for the best. They will
try and take advantage of the wait-or-see policies of the workers
leaders to manoeuvre, using the carrot and stick methods to cling to
office for as long as possible.</p>

<p>However, every attack made by the &#8220;new&#8221; ND government on
standards of living will create more resistance by the workers, who
now sense its weakness, and will push their leaders to take action.
In effect, the longer this government of crisis lasts the worse will
be the outcome for the capitalists.</p>

<p>This is why the ruling class has now promoted Karamanlis to the
Presidency and is also thinking of introducing proportional
representation at the next elections, so to make sure that PASOK will
not get a working majority. Their intention is that Karamanlis, will
be able in a &#8216;constitutional&#8217; way to block any attempt by a left
government, under the pressure of the workers, to take socialist
measures that could put in danger the control of the monopolies over
the economy and the state.</p>

<p>The deep crisis of capitalism, which has shown the disparity
between the high sounding promises and the actual centrist and
reformist policies of the leaders of PASOK and KKE has already begun
to cause concern among the rank-and-file of both parties.</p>

<p>This is particularly so in PASOK, where the issues of taking
power, socialisation of the means of production, workers&#8217;
management and how to fight the reaction of the imperialists against
a socialist government, are becoming more and more subjects of
discussion in the local branches.</p>

<p>In the party, which at present claims a total of 65,000 members,
the left s now composed of fresh and young elements, who, despite the
fact that they are not as yet organised and conscious of their
strength, represent the majority in the local branches and even the
area committees of the party.</p>

<p>This development, which is of course a reflection of the processes
taking place in society today, is also a vindication of the
perspectives of the Marxists in PASOK, who, even during the dark days
of mass expulsions and defeat of the left, predicted its rebirth and
increased power. The fight for a Marxist programme has begun again in
the ranks of PASOK because the battle for power tomorrow means
Marxist policies today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wage increases tied to inflation; a 40-hour week; abolition
of all anti-union laws; lower taxes for workers&#8217; families; work
for the unemployed.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Unite the struggle of poor peasants, youth and local
government with the workers in a common fight to oust the right-wing government.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Build a mass socialist party, based on the organisations of
workers, peasants and youth.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Organise against the new President and the semi-bonapartist
constitution, for a constituent assembly and a socialist constitution.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Fight for the nationalisation of the banks and all the
major industries under workers control and management; the monopoly
of foreign trade; a socialist plan of production.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Campaign for a left government of PASOK-KKE that can open
up the way to workers&#8217; power and the socialist transformation of society.</li>
</ul>
