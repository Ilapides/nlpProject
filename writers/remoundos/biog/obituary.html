(CWI Greece)</em></p>
<p class="fst"><em>On the afternoon of Tuesday, 4 September, Comrade Nicos
Remoundos, founding member of Xekinima (CWI Greece), and its
General Secretary until the late 1980&#8217;s, passed away at the age
of 71. On Friday, 7 September, Xekinima comrades organized an
excellent political funeral for Nicos Remoundos, with chants,
revolutionary songs, red flags and speeches by friends and
comrades. Among the speakers were Peter Taaffe, General Secretary
of the Socialist Party (CWI in England and Wales) and also
representing the International Secretariat of the CWI. Peter first
met Nicos in 1974 during the period of the overthrow of the
military dictatorship in Greece. Nicos and other comrades
subsequently joined the CWI. As well as Peter, other speakers at
the funeral included Doros Michael, from the Cyprus section of the
CWI, and other old comrades from the 1970&#8217;s, and Andros
Payiatsos, General Secretary of Xekinima.</em></p>
<p><em>Nicos&#8217;s coffin was draped by a huge CWI flag as it was
lowered into the ground, while his comrades and friends sung the
<strong>Internationale</strong>. When the coffin was finally lowered, the
call, &#8220;Comrade Nicos Remoundos &#8211; Present!&#8221; was made by
members of Xekinima and echoed throughout the First Cemetery of
Athens.</em></p>
<p><em>The following short obituary appeared in the last issue of
the <strong>Xekinima</strong> newspaper and on the website of
the Greek section of the CWI the day after Nicos&#8217; death. Much
more commentary and videos of the funeral of Nicos can be seen

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<br/>
<p class="fst">Nicos, our comrade, our friend, our brother, is no longer among
us. He lost the battle against his ill health and particularly from
Parkinson&#8217;s Disease from which Nicos suffered during the course of
the last decade. Although we all were aware of his health problems,
Niko&#8217;s death was a shock to all of us who knew him. Nicos was a
fighter and until his last moments had a vivid interest in political
developments, the struggles of the working class and the activities
of our organization.</p>

<p>Nicos will always be with us. This is not just a figure of
speech. Nicos&#8217; contribution to the development of <a href="http://www.xekinima.org/">Xekinima</a>
has been historic. In the course of the 1970s Nicos had a crucial
role in Xekinima&#8217;s first steps. As its General Secretary, until the
late 1980&#8217;s, Nicos played a major role in laying the foundations
that allowed Xekinima to be one of the most sizeable and important
organizations of the revolutionary socialist left in Greece today.</p>

<p>Nicos started his political contribution in the period of the
Greek military junta, playing a leading role in a small, clandestine
group, fighting against the military dictatorship, called the
&#8216;Workers&#8217; Group&#8217;. This group, which took part in the
revolutionary revolt at Athens Polytechnic in 1973, a prelude to the
collapse of the Junta in 1974, searched for the ideas and methods
required by the Left to answer the dead end of capitalism and
imperialism, based, among other things, on the experiences of the
1960&#8217;s. Thus, rejecting the barbaric one-party dictatorships of the
Stalinist regimes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and having
lived through the betrayals of the Stalinist Communist Party of
Greece, Nicos and his group moved towards the ideas of Leon Trotsky.</p>

<p>Nicos was always part of the mass working class movement and
strong opponent of any kind of sectarianism. Because of that he
decided, along with his small group of comrades, to participate in
PASOK from its inception in 1974. PASOK (The Panhellenic Socialist
Movement) was, at that time, a party with a working class base and a
radical left platform.</p>

<p>The newspaper <strong>Xekinima</strong> was founded one year later, in 1975,
and developed as a left opposition against the bureaucratic
leadership of the PASOK party and its policies. Soon after its
foundation, Xekinima played a key role in the creation of the
&#8216;Horizontal Connection&#8217;, a network of rank and file workers,
party branches and activists, in favor of a revolutionary socialist
programme for PASOK and for real party democracy. Because of this
call, Xekinima was expelled shortly afterwards from PASOK.</p>

<p>The years that followed were difficult. Xekinima was to a large
extent isolated in a very small group. People&#8217;s huge illusions in
the populist PASOK leader, Andreas Papandreou, and the Stalinist
politics of KKE (Greek communist party) allowed very little room for
efforts to build a strong base for the revolutionary Left. The space
for the left parties and organizations seemed to be entirely covered
by the huge illusions in social democray and Stalinism. During this
time, Xekinima was struggling to clarify its political, ideological
and organizational methods &#8211; a process whereby the Committee for a
Workers&#8217; International (CWI), in which Xekinima participated,
played a key role.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Deeply internationalist</h4>

<p class="fst">After the fall of the military dictatorship in 1974, Nicos and his
group had their first contacts with CWI. For Nicos, internationalism
was not just a &#8220;good idea&#8221; or to follow what was happening around
the world. Nicos&#8217;s internationalism reflected his keen
understanding of the necessity for co-ordinated struggles with
revolutionary socialists of other countries, based on the common
organization of an international revolutionary party. This was the
legacy of revolutionaries over the last two centuries and Nicos
followed in their footsteps. Nicos was deeply internationalist and
his internationalism characterized every aspect of his political
intervention. He remained a loyal supporter of the CWI, following its
steps forward and its development with extreme interest until his
last days.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 1990s, Xekinima came to a turning
point. PASOK had fully transformed into a party of the establishment
and big capital and the collapse of the Soviet Union caused a
tremendous crisis in the Left worldwide. This made it necessary to
re-evaluate revolutionary tactics. Nicos supported the tactical
changes of the CWI and stood by the new generation of fighters who
struggled to put them into practice.</p>

<p>During the last decade, Xekinima was able to become one of the
better known and sizeable organizations of the revolutionary Left in
Greece. This achievement is also a vindication of Nicos&#8217; political efforts.</p>

<p>Xekinima will always honour Nicos&#8217; political contribution to the
building of revolutionary Left in Greece. Besides that, we will
remember Nicos for two additional reasons. The first was his deep
connection and loyalty to the working class and his strong belief in
its ability to emancipate itself. The second was Nicos&#8217;s genuine
humanism and closeness to his friends and comrades. Nicos would
always assist in any way he could other comrades who were in need.
That was part of his humanism. For Nicos, socialism was not only a
correct social, political and economical model but also a way of
life, to the extent that the capitalist system, of course, allows.</p>

<p>Nicos we will miss you! But we will always remember you and honour you!</p>
