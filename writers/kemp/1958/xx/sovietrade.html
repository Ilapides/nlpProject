<p class="c"><strong>Conflicting hopes and fears have been aroused in
other countries by the increased exports from the Soviet bloc. What is
the real perspective?</strong></p>
<p class="fst">RECENT spectacular evidence of the technological prowess
of the USSR has made the capitalist world increasingly conscious of the
economic challenge from that quarter. Serious attention has been paid
to Khrushchev&#8217;s reiterated boasts of the ability of the Soviet Union to
catch up with and outstrip the advanced capitalist countries
economically. But while that is a matter for the next few decades, the
increasing activities of the USSR, and the other countries in its bloc,
in the sphere of international trade and, more recently, as a source of
aid for former colonial and &#8220;backward&#8221; countries, in direct competition
with the USA and the advanced countries, has raised the prospect of a
new and even sharper immediate challenge.</p>
<p>It is true that not only Soviet propagandists, but also those
Americans concerned with impressing Congress and public opinion with
the need to step up military spending and foreign aid, have an interest
in exaggerating the volume of this Russian aid. Even when allowance has
been made for this, there can be no doubt that the Soviet bloc
countries are now pressing into the capitalist world market to an
extent which was impossible only a few years ago; moreover there are
considerable potentialities for this to go much further in coming
years. A new, and it must be admitted, incalculable factor is being
injected into the political, as well as economic, world relationship of
forces. Despite deficiencies and contradictions in the available
evidence it is advisable to summarize these new trends and estimate
their significance for the future.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Background</h4>
<p class="fst">As a preliminary, the past relationship of the USSR with
the capitalist world market needs to be sketched in. <a id="f1"
href="#n1" name="f1" target="_blank" >[1]</a> Lack of exportable surpluses, the
hostility of the outside world and to no small degree deliberate policy
had, by the 1930&#8217;s, reduced the foreign trade of the USSR considerably
below that of Czarist Russia. During the Five Year plans, especially
the first, the direct impact was felt of conditions in the world
market. An indispensable minimum of imports had to be obtained from the
capitalist countries, especially of machinery to be paid for with
agricultural products. The collapse of prices during the depression,
and, consequently, the deterioration of Russia&#8217;s &#8220;net barter&#8221; terms of
trade, had a markedly unfavorable effect on the plan. <a id="f2"
href="#n2" name="f2" target="_blank" >[2]</a></p>

<p>The policy of building &#8220;socialism in one country,&#8221; apart from its
political aspect, meant a degree of self-exclusion from the world
market which could only increase the burden of heavy investment
required by industrialization under pressure. Not that the USSR could
be completely self-sufficient &#8211; certain raw materials, machine tools
and manufactured goods could only be obtained in the course of trade.
Indeed, when the normal channels were interrupted by the outbreak of
war in the West in 1939 it was indispensable to rush through trade
deals with countries which were still accessible.</p>
<p>Then, after 1941, the economic contact  with the
capitalist world greatly increased, primarily because of the need for
strategic commodities and armaments. This took the form of a large
import surplus covered by the Lease Lend agreements with the USA,
Britain and Canada. No doubt in the short-lived false dawn of the
Teheran and Yalta conferences closer economic ties with the Western
countries were expected.</p>

<p class="fst">However, the extension of the Soviet sphere in Eastern
Europe, the Marshall Plan and the &#8220;cold war,&#8221; culminating in the Korean
affair, resulted in the East-West exchanges being greatly reduced. The
USA sought to deprive the USSR, and later China, of strategic materials
and imposed this policy on her clients in the Marshall Plan itself in
1948. The Labour government in Britain imposed its own ban in 1949. In
the course of the next few years these restrictions were made more
detailed and were reinforced by the passage of the Battle Act in the
USA in 1951. In addition an embargo was imposed upon trade with China
through a resolution of the United Nations.</p>
<p>From the Soviet side a theoretical consecration of the reduction in
trade was given by Stalin in his last work, <strong>Economic Problems
of Socialism</strong>, in which he spoke of &#8220;two parallel world
markets.&#8221; He claimed that this outcome represented an aspect of &#8220;the
general crisis of the world capitalist system&#8221;; with the &#8220;socialist
camp,&#8221; as a result of its fast rate of industrial development, moving
to a position where its members will &#8220;not only be in no need of imports
from capitalist countries, but will themselves feel the necessity of
finding an outside market for their surplus products.&#8221; <a id="f3"
href="#n3" name="f3" target="_blank" >[3]</a></p>

<p>Not long before in the same year, 1952, an International Economic
Conference was held in Moscow as a climax to a great campaign to break
through the trade embargo and increase the volume of exchanges with the
capitalist countries. In terms of its effects on trade, this piece of
junketing was a failure, though it no doubt scored some propaganda
points. On the basis of Stalin&#8217;s pronouncements the persistent demands
for East-West trade voiced by the Communist parties in the capitalist
countries appear contradictory &#8211; unless it was to provide a market for
those &#8220;surplus products&#8221; of which Stalin spoke. It was more likely that
Stalin was rationalizing a situation which was far from being to the
advantage of the USSR and that the trade embargoes were having adverse
effects not only on the Eastern European countries &#8211; cut off from their
traditional markets &#8211; but on the USSR itself. <a id="f4" href="#n4"
name="f4" target="_blank" >[4]</a></p>
<p>Looked at from the technical standpoint of, say, the economists of
the Economic Committee for Europe at Geneva, the price that was being
paid by both sides for the artificial division of the old continent was
harmful and unnecessary. <a id="f5" href="#n5" name="f5" target="_blank" >[5]</a> It
was not difficult to point out that the abnormal reduction in the
volume of exchanges did nobody any good, and that complementary
economies were being kept apart at great cost. In practice, however, no
iron curtain divides politics and economics. There were, of course,
politicians and businessmen in the West who would have liked to see a
greater volume of East-West trade, which could have eased the balance
of payments difficulties of the Western countries and provided a way
out of economic, political and military dependence on the USA. However,
in the main, and no doubt correctly, the West European bourgeoisie
estimated that its survival was linked with the USA, as the dominant
segment of the capitalist world system. The costs and risks of the

&#8220;cold war&#8221; &#8211; with American support &#8211; were preferred to the problematic
advantages of &#8220;peaceful coexistence&#8221;; that is, maintenance of the
status quo in face of gathering revolutionary processes which Western
imperialism felt must be rolled back if capitalism were to avoid
extinction. Of course, the nature of the problem changed with the
development of the world situation. By the mid-1950&#8217;s, if not earlier,
among the allies of the USA there was growing dissatisfaction with the
trade restrictions.</p>

<p class="fst">East-West trade, as such, offered no panacea for an evil
which was rooted historically in the dire problems of an outworn social
system on the one hand and the contradictions of bureaucratically
degenerated, or deformed, regimes on a progressive base on the other.
Although the prosperity of the capitalist world in this period made the
problem less serious, the latent trade war breaking into the open
became increasingly burdensome to both sides &#8211; the demands of the world
market were reasserting themselves.</p>
<p>Not only, as Stalin had foreseen, did the Eastern bloc have export
surpluses, but it also needed goods from the rest of the world in
increasing volume to carry through its industrial plans and meet the
demands of consumers for a greater choice and variety of goods. At the
same time, the world political situation offered possibilities of
strengthening relationships with the &#8220;uncommitted countries,&#8221; such as
India, Burma and Indonesia, through the offer of industrial, technical
and military aid. On the side of the capitalist states, the passing up
of lucrative trading possibilities became increasingly irksome,
especially as the danger of imminent war receded and problems of
overproduction and increased trade competition loomed ahead for certain
industries.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>&#8220;Peaceful Coexistence&#8221;</h4>

<p class="fst">In the view of the Soviet leaders, &#8220;peaceful
coexistence&#8221; presupposes increased trade between the &#8220;two world
markets.&#8221; Thus Mikoyan, at the Twentieth Congress of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union, brought out the doctrine of comparative
costs to underline the point. <a id="f6" href="#n6" name="f6" target="_blank" >[6]</a>
No doubt such arguments express a sincere desire for a <em>modus
vivendi</em> through the normalization of trading relations with the
capitalist states. At the same time they express the fact that the USSR
is not, and cannot be, isolated from the capitalist world market.</p>
<p>Since 1955, when summit talks took place in Geneva, trade between
Eastern and Western European countries has been increasing. In 1956 it <em>rose</em>

by 20% and a further rise occurred last year. But on both sides
restrictions remain which are bound up with the political division of
the world. In any event, the further industrialization of the USSR, and
more particularly Eastern Europe, may have reduced the possibility of
export from the area of the &#8220;traditional exports,&#8221; mainly food and raw
materials. Their demands upon the world market will likewise have been
undergoing change. The simple complementarity of the two &#8220;halves&#8221; of
Europe is no longer as plain. By this time more manufactured exports
could figure in the trade of the East European countries; on the face
of it they may penetrate more easily into the less developed countries
outside the Soviet bloc rather than into Western Europe.</p>
<p>The goods which Western Europe has been sending East in greater
quantities in recent years are &#8220;raw materials for capital goods
industries&#8221; and &#8220;engineering products&#8221; &#8211; an index of the demands of
industrializing countries. For example, the Soviet Union and Poland
have, in recent years, placed important orders for complete industrial
plants and power station equipment. <a id="f7" href="#n7" name="f7" target="_blank" >[7]</a>

On the other hand, it is well known that such countries also export
complete plants or &#8220;aggregates,&#8221; mostly to others in the bloc, but in
some cases outside it. Thus specialization and the advantages of the
international division of labor are asserting themselves once again, if
at a higher level.</p>
<p>The end of the phase of apparently boundless prosperity in the
capitalist countries reinforces the demand for a reappraisal of the
possibilities offered by these markets. In 1957 Britain decided to seek
trade with China, despite the embargo, though still within the limits
of the restrictions on strategic exports. Under conditions of a
spreading trade crisis in the West there may well be a struggle for a
place in these markets. <a id="f8" href="#n8" name="f8" target="_blank" >[8]</a> While
these openings cannot avert a trade decline they can alleviate the
position for those countries which are prepared to go along with the
Soviet Union and her allies in other respects. A situation might,
therefore, arise in which the USSR would be able to drive hard bargains
because of the anxiety of the capitalist countries to find a market for
their goods. On the other hand, the arrival on the world market of
goods of which the USSR has an oversupply herself might aggravate the
decline in prices of such products and worsen trading problems in the
capitalist world. A recent example of this is the sale of aluminum,
which has obliged Canadian producers to lower their prices. <a id="f9"
href="#n9" name="f9" target="_blank" >[9]</a> However, the role which foreign trade
plays in the capitalist economies and those which are centrally planned
is different in certain important respects. The capitalist countries,
as well as having to provide themselves through foreign trade with
commodities which it is impossible or uneconomic for them to produce in
their own territory, need markets to realize their goods at a profit.
At the same time, because of the anarchic nature of capitalist
production relations, to continue to realize goods at a profit in the
internal market may depend upon not merely maintaining but increasing
the export market. For capitalist countries, &#8220;export or die&#8221; becomes an
economic imperative in time of slump. While, as regards the USA, its
disproportionate development in relation to the rest of the capitalist
world market has produced unrealizable surpluses &#8211; in goods or
productive capacity &#8211; and to sustain the level of profits and activity
a permanent unpaid export surplus is necessary. Of course, the
surpluses are disposed of in such a way as to serve the interests of
American capitalism.</p>

<p>In the case of the USSR and similar planned economies, foreign trade
is bound up with the plan itself. However, it does present some special
problems. For example, since agricultural production varies with the
harvests there may be years in which surpluses are available for export
or when imports are required in order to meet a shortage in the
harvest. For the rest, the endeavor will be made to regulate the volume
of import-export flows in accordance with the requirements of the plan.
Of course, plans may not be achieved, or they may be overfulfilled;
but, once the plan is operating, changes in exports and/or imports will
require reallocation of resources within the plan. This may limit the
willingness of such countries to participate in multilateral trade in
the world market. Generally, they will have a preference for bilateral
agreements which determine in advance the amount and kind of goods to
be exchanged &#8211; and for a capitalist economy it may be difficult for
such an undertaking to be fulfilled. <a id="f10" href="#n10" name="f10" target="_blank" >[10]</a></p>
<p>If some inflexibility in foreign trade arises from a plan, the plan
does not dominate foreign trade to the extent it does internal economic
developments. As one authority puts it: &#8220;If the State is master of all
the economic levers of command inside the USSR, the bodies concerned
with external trade have, on the contrary, to take account of price and
production movements, fluctuations in supply and demand, which occur
independent of their will. Also, given the profound repercussions
which, in certain circumstances, the non-fulfillment of
the plan for foreign trade will have on the execution of the production
plan, one reaches here one of the weakest points of all planning
carried out on the scale of a single country, large as it may be. <a
id="f11" href="#n11" name="f11" target="_blank" >[11]</a></p>
<p>Under planning, then, there are definite limitations to the scope
for altering the volume of imports or exports in the short run &#8211;
assuming that they first have to be paid for out of current (planned)
production by the sale of goods at world market prices; while exports
can only be increased at the expense of (planned) investment or
consumption unless output has exceeded that planned. Failure to import
on the scale planned or to sell what had been planned at favorable
prices will affect the plan adversely. On the other hand, the necessary
readjustments can be made under the control of the planning bodies.
There is not the same drive to dispose of export surpluses at all
costs, such as is found in the capitalist economies. It is, of course,
fundamental that there should be a state monopoly of foreign trade.</p>
<p>What this very terse summary of a complex problem shows is (1) that
the world market and the international division of labor impress
themselves on a planned economy in one country; (2) that in the short
run the foreign trade of such an economy cannot be varied entirely to
order. It is true that increased imports can be paid for from reserves
of gold and foreign exchange, or even from credits, while exports could
be supplied on credit or made as grants, but, apart from
overfulfillment of the plan in that line, only at the expense of
domestic consumption and/or investment.</p>

<p>This implies that there are definite, and it may be, in the short
run, quite narrow limits to the increase possible in East-West trade.
Within these limits, however, trade and aid can be consciously directed
and employed with deliberation by the USSR and, to some extent by the
East European countries, as a political weapon. Again its effectiveness
will depend upon circumstances. The ability to turn trade on and off,
to switch imports from one country to another and provide aid in the
service of foreign policy has been demonstrated many times over the
past decade or two. Thus the political significance of the purchase of
part of the Egyptian cotton crop or even of the Icelandic trawler
catch. Credits were withdrawn from Yugoslavia at the time of the break
with the Cominform; new credits were extended after the reconciliation
in 1955, and withheld as part of the virulent anti-Tito campaign in the
summer of 1958. The entry of the USSR into the world economy on a
growing scale as buyer, seller and creditor opens up ways of altering
the political balance in her favor.</p>
<p>Even with the growth in trade between East and West which has taken
place in recent years it remains below the prewar level. It is still
very small in relation to the total trade of Western Europe. Thus
imports from East Europe and the USSR were 8.4% of the total in 1937;
in 1956 they were only 3%. Exports at 6.8% in 1937 were down to 3.5% in
1956. The only countries whose trade with the Eastern European
countries exceeded 15% of the total were Iceland, Finland, Yugoslavia
and Turkey &#8211; geography, rather than politics, played a major role here.
<a id="f12" href="#n12" name="f12" target="_blank" >[12]</a></p>
<p>As far as the Soviet Union is concerned it seems probable that means
of payment are no problem when goods are urgently required &#8211; gold,
foreign exchange, arms, or whatever it may be, are made available. Use
is made of multilateral payments; for example, earnings in sterling
from the sale of goods to the United Kingdom may be used for the
purchase of raw materials from the Sterling Area. Since the absolute
volume of the exchanges with the Western countries is still so low, it
seems likely that they would have to increase many times over before
means of payment became a real problem. Political factors at present
play the main role. This seems to have been the case, for instance,
with the large &#8220;shopping list&#8221; publicized at the time of the
Bulganin-Khrushchev visit to Britain. Only a fraction has been bought,
even though much of it was not covered by the embargo on strategic
goods. <a id="f13" href="#n13" name="f13" target="_blank" >[13]</a></p>
<p>For the other East European countries the political obstacles are
even more apparent. Their desire to sell in the West &#8211; their main
prewar market &#8211; is no doubt still important and they would be only too
happy to follow Poland in obtaining credits from the same sources,
although they may not like to say so openly, since imports could ease
internal economic strains. It is difficult to see any possibility of
closer economic inter-penetration on the basis of &#8220;peaceful
coexistence.&#8221; Indeed, the development of the European Common Market, so
far as it succeeds, will probably constitute an obstacle to
reestablishing trade links between East and West. <a id="f14"
href="#n14" name="f14" target="_blank" >[14]</a><br>

&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Recent Appeals</h4>
<p class="fst">Notable efforts have been made lately by the USSR to
develop a larger volume of East-West exchanges. American newspapermen,
economists and finally the President himself have been appealed to with
arguments of mutual interest. Thus the Soviet economist, Aboltin, in a
special communication to the American Economic Association, indicated
that the &#8220;socialist&#8221; countries &#8220;offered a stable market not subject to
cyclical changes.&#8221; Attuned to the current recession, he made the point
which is a frequent standby of Soviet propaganda; that is, that &#8220;In
case of an economic crisis the guaranteed stable market provided by the
countries of the socialist system can substantially improve the lot of
the working class and the peasantry and also alleviate the difficulties
of industrialists hit by the crisis.&#8221; <a id="f15" href="#n15"
name="f15" target="_blank" >[15]</a> Khrushchev made a similar point in his letter to
Eisenhower of June 2, 1958. The substantial purchases from the USA
which he contemplated &#8220;would enable American industries to work at a
higher percentage of their capacity and would raise the level of
employment.&#8221; <a id="f16" href="#n16" name="f16" target="_blank" >[16]</a></p>

<p>It can hardly be assumed, however, that Khrushchev and his academic
cohorts are only thinking of the welfare of the working class, or of
industrialists, in the capitalist countries. Khrushchev is capable of
speaking for hours about the future, with its competition between
socialism and capitalism, without referring at all to the role of the
working class in the advanced countries. Nor should the contradiction
in the idea of the Soviet Union offering itself to capitalism as a life
line in a period of crisis have escaped his academicians. Indeed, the
goods which are obtained by trade still have to be realized in the
internal market. How can that be accomplished when such commodities are
glutting the market owing to depression?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Khrushchev acts quite empirically, and speaks as
he acts &#8211; by definition, as it were, he cannot be a &#8220;revisionist.&#8221; In
the letter to Eisenhower the motives of the East-West trade campaign,
from the Soviet side, seem quite transparently revealed. If the
grandiose 15-20 year plans upon which Khrushchev is staking his
reputation are to be realized, tremendous additional investment will be
needed &#8211; he loses no occasion, for example, to stress &#8220;the paramount
task of developing heavy industry.&#8221; However, the lags and
disproportions in Soviet economy, for all the rapid expansion of recent
years &#8211; and in part because of it &#8211; are manifest. There is, therefore,
an imperative necessity to alleviate the strains, as far as possible,
and to increase the flow of goods on to the market without prejudicing
the fulfillment of the plans.</p>

<p>Here foreign trade can play an important role. Especially when there
is a desire to &#8220;catch up&#8221; in fields where the Soviet Union is
especially backward. If finished goods can be obtained in such fields,
considerable investment can be avoided and valuable time bought. This
is especially true in relation to plastics and chemicals &#8211; in which
serious lags behind developments in the advanced capitalist countries
exist. Although Khrushchev says: &#8220;The Soviet Union has every
opportunity, and all the necessary resources, for successfully
fulfilling the programme&#8221; <a id="f17" href="#n17" name="f17" target="_blank" >[17]</a>,
he goes on straight away to admit, in effect, that this is only so in
the long run. Meanwhile he proposes a long list of machinery which the
USSR would like to buy in the USA at once, offering in exchange, it may
be said, the raw materials which typically figure in the export lists
of a less developed country.</p>
<p>The attractive prospect held out to capitalism of alleviating crisis
by trade with the Soviet Union disguises Khrushchev&#8217;s purpose of
diminishing the strains of the present phase in Soviet economic
development. This recognition is not, of course, an argument against
East-West trade. But it does stand in contrast to some of the official
boasts or claims that the Soviet Union has broken away from the
capitalist world market, built &#8220;socialism in one country,&#8221; and so on.</p>

<p>The Economic Committee for Europe falls into such a mistake when it
says: &#8220;The costs of autarchy are by now probably insignificant for the
Soviet Union ...&#8221; and draws a contrast between its situation and that
of the smaller countries of Eastern Europe. <a id="f18" href="#n18"
name="f18" target="_blank" >[18]</a> The statement is valid only in the most abstract
way; i.e., in the light of the mass and variety of Soviet natural
resources. In terms of the real world it is meaningless.</p>
<p>For one thing the USSR is closely tied up with the other countries
in the bloc, and through them with the world market. And more directly,
as has been seen, not only the political but also the purely economic
costs of autarchy are far too high for Khrushchev to be able to meet.
His efforts to secure a larger place in the capitalist world market
give the lie, too, to Stalin&#8217;s pretensions regarding the parallel world
market.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The &#8220;Second&#8221; World Market</h4>

<p class="fst">The economic relations of the USSR with the &#8220;peoples
democracies&#8221; have shown many contradictions over the past decade. Most
of these countries were economically backward; the first task, after
the reconstruction phase in the early postwar years, was
industrialization. At the same time, the economic links of these
countries had formerly been predominantly with the Western European
area. Under the new conditions, however, the leading trading role was
played by the USSR both as an exporter and an importer. In addition,
some of these countries were obliged to pay reparations to the USSR. <a
id="f19" href="#n19" name="f19" target="_blank" >[19]</a></p>
<p>What was most remarkable was the limited nature of the progress
achieved in coordinating the economies of these countries, although
they were all, after 1948, organized on a planned basis under the
control of Communist parties, The Council of Economic Mutual Aid
(CEMA), set up in 1949 as a counter to the Marshall Plan (which some of
the East European countries might have sought to join but for Soviet
opposition), did little more than facilitate agreements for trade and
industrial and technical assistance between pairs of countries. <a
id="f20" href="#n20" name="f20" target="_blank" >[20]</a> There were innumerable
bilateral bargains amounting to barter deals &#8211; nothing as flexible as
the multilateral clearings possible between the Western countries in
the European Payments Union (EPU). <a id="f21" href="#n21" name="f21" target="_blank" >[21]</a></p>
<p>At the same time, within these countries, all of which were small,
and all except East Germany and Czechoslovakia backward, the attempt
was made, in a short space of time, to establish a rounded industrial
structure with emphasis on heavy industry on the lines of the Five Year
plans of the Soviet Union. This served to underline their dependence
upon the USSR &#8211; especially for industrial raw materials such as iron
ore &#8211; which also became a main outlet for their exports. There was,
however, little specialization between the countries in the
industrialization plans, apart from that which was obviously imposed by
physical factors.</p>

<p>The upshot of the unimaginative following of the Soviet model was a
sequence of strains and stresses, particularly marked from 1953 onwards
and culminating in the Polish October and the Hungarian Revolution in
1956. These methods had been costly in popular good will as well as in
resources. It was particularly obvious that there had been inadequate
coordination of planning and trade, despite CEMA.</p>
<p>At its sixth session in December 1955, CEMA took steps to bring in a
greater degree of division of labor as far as engineering products and
fuels were concerned. Provision was also made for greater coordination
in the separate national plans. However, it was not until the Warsaw
meeting of CEMA, in July 1957, that proposals were put forward for
long-term coordination of the national plans for ten or fifteen years.
Permanent commissions were set up to consider the problems of
particular industries and to secure a greater degree of cooperation in
research and development. A multilateral clearing was also to be worked
out for facilitating trade within the area. These belated projects,
which are still in the formative stage, are a token of the previous
lack of such coordination, of which there have been many complaints in
the East European countries in the last two years. <a id="f22"

<p class="fst">It has now become customary to castigate the mistakes of
the earlier period and to accept the proposition that considerably
greater advantage must be taken of the international division of labor.
Of course, the advanced countries, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, in
this area were particularly disadvantaged by the shrinkage of foreign
markets as well as by the inadequate degree of division of labor within
the bloc itself. Thus V. Kaigl, Director of the Economic Institute of
the Academy of Science of Czechoslovakia, has stressed the elementary
truth that in order to take advantage of the economies of large-scale
production and automation the heavy fixed costs must be spread over a
large volume of output. <a id="f23" href="#n23" name="f23" target="_blank" >[23]</a></p>

<p>For a country with a small home market and a high degree of
specialization in manufacturing, like Czechoslovakia, that means fuller
participation in external trade, &#8220;the need to intensify specialization
and the co-ordination of production between all the countries of the
socialist camp.&#8221; It is true the Kaigl speaks only of the &#8220;socialist
camp,&#8221; but no doubt it would be greatly to the advantage of
Czechoslovakia to extend its market more broadly in other parts of the
world, in the underdeveloped countries, for example, to which it could
export machine tools and other products needed for developing industry.</p>
<p>The economic strains experienced by the countries in the Eastern
European bloc has led to greater interest being taken in participation
in the international division of labor. In order to determine the goods
which it will be advantageous to trade with the rest of the world,
however, more careful assessment will have to be made of relative costs
of production.</p>
<p>According to a recent number of the Economic Bulletin for Europe it
is anticipated that endeavors to take fuller advantage of the
international division of labor will result &#8220;in some reversion to
commodities traditionally exported to Western Europe which had been
neglected in the past, and increased efforts may be made to push the
production of those commodities among the new export items which appear
to be competitive on western markets at prices more or less reflecting
domestic production costs.&#8221; <a id="f24" href="#n24" name="f24" target="_blank" >[24]</a>
The same journal notes that Hungary, East Germany and Poland have
&#8220;granted enterprises the right to conclude deals directly with foreign
firms in some industries.&#8221; An instance of such a deal is that between
Poland and India in 1956, concerning state enterprises on both sides in
which Polish steel and cement were exchanged for Indian iron ore. <a
id="f25" href="#n25" name="f25" target="_blank" >[25]</a></p>

<p>Up to now, however, the East European countries have been highly
dependent on the USSR. To a considerable extent Soviet trade took the
form of an export of raw materials which later, in part, returned to
the Soviet Union in finished form. But a good deal of the
industrialization of the area was carried through with the help of
machinery and even fully equipped plants from the Soviet Union.
Continuing industrialization, especially because of the disproportions
involved in the method by which it was undertaken, has increased
dependence on the USSR. Meanwhile the flow of finished goods back to
her market now constitutes an important addition to supplies for
consumers increasingly insistent upon the availability of more and
better quality goods.</p>
<p>No doubt these countries have been assets to the Soviet Union, at
least until the last two years or so &#8211; she has been able to get the
better of trading bargains. Since no balance of payments figures are
published and such items as military aid are unknown it would be an
impossible task to draw up a balance sheet. Even hostile critics now
admit that the current net balance is flowing the other way. <a
id="f26" href="#n26" name="f26" target="_blank" >[26]</a> Hungary has become a heavy
liability. Considerable aid and concessions have had to be made to
Gomulka&#8217;s Poland and, in a lesser degree, to East Germany and Albania. <a
id="f27" href="#n27" name="f27" target="_blank" >[27]</a><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>China Needs Aid</h4>
<p class="fst">The victory of the Chinese Communists and the need to
carry forward the economic development of a backward Asiatic country of
600,000,000 people simultaneously raised new and immense problems. The
major part of the capital for investment in Chinese industrialization
had to come from domestic resources. But outside assistance was
imperative and, with the hostility of the capitalist world, it could
only come from the USSR and Eastern Europe &#8211; themselves by no means
endowed with a surplus of capital in this period.</p>

<p>Although a great deal of equipment for industries and collective
farms was received from these countries, this aid was offset to some
extent by that which China had to grant to North Korea and Viet Nam.
The Chinese economy was under considerable pressure to export, and
still is, in order to expand trade with its trading partners in Eastern
Europe or anywhere else so far as trade restrictions allow. The
economic problems of China have not been unlike those of the East
European countries in recent years. The Soviet Union has taken the
place of the rest of the world as a trading partner &#8211; accounting for
about 80% of Chinese trade in 1954. Several loans have been obtained
from the USSR to
be paid off in agricultural and mineral products and handicraft goods.</p>
<p>Still capital is short and some raw materials have to be bought
abroad. This imposes a strain on agriculture, which is the main sector
from which exports can be derived. While agricultural production
increases too slowly, domestic consumption tends to rise; as a
consequence, &#8220;planned targets for export often have to be lowered
because of increased domestic demand.&#8221; <a id="f28" href="#n28"
name="f28" target="_blank" >[28]</a> There is no doubt that the trade embargo imposed
by the United States has, as was intended, increased the strain of
industrialization. <a id="f29" href="#n29" name="f29" target="_blank" >[29]</a> Or
putting it another way, if China could have participated more freely in
the world market her economic development would have been smoother.</p>
<p>Whether in its European or Asian segments the so-called &#8220;parallel
world market&#8221; has been inherently incapable of compensating for lack of
fuller participation in the world market. Indeed, the fullest
possibilities of international division of labor within this market
have not been seized as they could have been. In large part because of
the nature of the economies which compose it, the volume of their
exchanges is very much smaller than those in the rest of the world. The
raising of income levels within it both depends upon, and will make
necessary, increasing specialization and exchange &#8211; thus does the world
market impose itself.<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Soviet Prestige</h4>
<p class="fst">In the last decade or so the attractive power of Soviet
central planning has been particularly marked in those countries which,
having recently acquired political independence, have been seeking to
carry forward policies of economic development. Even where this
influence has not taken the form of the emergence of an influential
Communist party, it has, nonetheless, been evident in the prestige of
the USSR and the interest taken in its economic achievements. Indeed,
the experience of the USSR is directly relevant to countries faced by
the need to embark upon heavy investment programs in order to raise
future income levels. The remarkable economic development in Soviet
Central Asia, for example, cannot fail to impress when compared with
the continued stagnation or sluggish growth of similar areas. <a
id="f30" href="#n30" name="f30" target="_blank" >[30]</a></p>
<p>Further, the existence of a non-capitalist group of powers provides
the ruling groups in the newly emancipated countries with valuable possibilities of
maneuver and of leaning upon the Soviet Union in order to counter the
influence of imperialism. <a id="f31" href="#n31" name="f31" target="_blank" >[31]</a>
Until the last few years, however, although the USSR might proffer
counsel and facilitate cultural exchanges and the like it could hold
out little in the way of material assistance to compare with the flow
of US dollars. But this pattern is changing. To a certain extent, and
in growing measure, the countries of Asia today, perhaps those of
Africa tomorrow, can turn to the USSR for technical and financial
assistance, thereby reducing their dependence on the capitalist
countries and contributing to the rounding out of their new-won status.</p>
<p>As already pointed out, there is a double possibility of propaganda
exaggeration in the extent of the aid so far given. On the other hand
some capitalist critics have been busy deflating these exaggerations to
something like their true dimensions.</p>
<p>Of the total of $1,900,000,000, for total Soviet aid to
&#8220;uncommitted&#8221; countries since 1955 publicized by the State Department,
one-quarter went to Yugoslavia, one-quarter in arms to Egypt, Syria and
Afghanistan, and, according to <strong>The Economist,</strong> of the
remainder, &#8220;only a fraction has actually reached the recipients.&#8221; <a
id="f32" href="#n32" name="f32" target="_blank" >[32]</a> There are, of course, sour
grapes in this writing down of a new threat to world capitalism which
actually cannot but give grave concern both in the USA and in Britain
Indeed the increasing attention it receives in the press is an index of
mounting anxiety. After all, the arms shipments to Egypt were a thorn
in the side of the imperialists; nor can the more recent aid to
Indonesia, relatively small as it is, be brushed off so easily. <a
id="f33" href="#n33" name="f33" target="_blank" >[33]</a> Since the credits so far
granted are for a period of years, the whole sum has not yet actually
been received in goods; but it will be &#8211; and there will be more to
follow. The significant thing is that a beginning has been made.</p>

<p>However, when all has been said and done, both aid and trade are, so
far, on a relatively small scale. Future aid depends upon the ability
of the Soviet economy; and also upon the health of the East European
countries and China, which will undoubtedly have prior call on
available resources.</p>
<p>What are the prospects here? Clearly, continued rapid growth on the
scale necessary to fulfill Khrushchev&#8217;s promises will require
considerable new capital investment in the USSR. Some sectors of the
economy, in particular, will require either expansion or a greater
effort at re-equipment. Certain geographical areas, including Central
Asia, lag behind in income levels and still need much new investment if
they are to be brought up to the level of the more advanced regions.
Agriculture, transport and power, for example, all need huge new
investments of capital if per capita income is to be brought up to West
European levels. Likewise, in Eastern Europe, further Soviet aid may be
needed in order to bolster the economy. As for China, there will, for
many years to come, be an inexhaustible demand for capital.</p>
<p>Great demands are therefore likely to be made on Soviet productive
capacity in the coming period, so great that a tremendous outflow of
aid to &#8220;uncommitted&#8221; areas is unlikely. On the other hand, there will
undoubtedly be &#8220;surpluses,&#8221; both of raw materials and of capital goods,
as capacity expands, which it will be in the interests of the Soviet
Union to exchange on the world market or to deploy in aid in accordance
with international political needs. Indeed, it may, in the interest of
external security, be worthwhile, or necessary, to supply these goods
on long credit terms to underdeveloped countries. On the other hand,
taking Khrushchev&#8217;s protestations of &#8220;peaceful coexistence&#8221; at their
face value, the Western countries may propose, as <strong>The Economist</strong>

suggests, Soviet participation in a United Nations program of aid to
the underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p>Trade, as distinct from aid, between the USSR and Eastern Europe and
the other continents, also remains of comparative insignificance. Thus
a United Nations report states, &#8220;Even after the increases in recent
years, trade with overseas areas is still of relatively small
importance in the foreign trade of East European countries. In 1956 it
probably accounted for some 6-8% of their total foreign trade and some
30% of their trade with the Western trading region.&#8221; Similarly, &#8220;For
the overseas trade-partners the relative importance of the trade is
even smaller and rarely amounts to more than 3%.&#8221; <a id="f34"
href="#n34" name="f34" target="_blank" >[34]</a></p>
<p>Trade with Latin America is small &#8211; since that area is under the
dominance of the USA &#8211; so is that with Africa. Even in Asia and the Far
East, where the prestige of the USSR is highest, trade is still small
compared with that of the capitalist countries. Thus India&#8217;s trade with
the USSR and Eastern Europe is roughly only one-tenth that with the
United Kingdom. The same is true of Indonesia, where trade with the
USSR in the first six months of 1957 amounted to only  &pound;8,000,000 for
imports and exports combined.</p>

<p>The Soviet impact on world trade, while growing, so far remains
small. There is no special pressure to sell, though there is clearly an
advantage in exchanging surpluses for goods which can contribute
positively to internal economic development. But Soviet transactions &#8211;
selling, buying or making credits &#8211; can be pursued with one eye on the
political implications. The politically independent underdeveloped
countries, seeking to extricate themselves from economic subservience
or wishing to find a support in opposition to the imperialist powers,
turn increasingly to the USSR for economic aid. Political expediency,
as well as the claims of economic advantage, will in fact largely
determine the kind of bargains into which the USSR will enter. And in
the existing political division of the world there is not the choice of
abstaining. From this standpoint, too, the USSR finds itself
inextricably involved in the world arena. In particular it cannot stand
by and watch the &#8220;underdeveloped&#8221; countries swinging into the balance
against the Soviet Union, behind the USA under the rule of American
stooges.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p class="fst">This survey suggests that the economic impact of the
&#8220;Eastern bloc&#8221; on the capitalist world market, while growing, is still
modest. There appear to be distinct limitations to spectacular growth
in the immediate future, though no doubt the trends of recent years
towards a greater volume of exchanges will be continued.</p>

<p>The further growth of those economies will impose the need for
greater specialization &#8211; both within the so-called &#8220;socialist camp&#8221; and
between its component countries and others in the capitalist orbit. As
pointed out, the Czechs, with their advanced industry and confined
territory, are especially sensitive to this factor. But to a greater or
lesser degree these needs are felt from China to Rumania.</p>
<p>Increasing contact with the world market will impose the need for
greater flexibility and will reveal weaknesses &#8211; exposing bureaucratic
mismanagement to the scrutiny of comparison. Indeed this has long been
the case, especially with East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Thus the
United Nations Economic Bulletin for Europe pointed out that in both
these countries in 1957 &#8220;the relatively high rates of growth of
over-all output which have so far been maintained conceal continuing
failures to produce the assortment and quality of goods required and to
reduce production costs according to plan. The familiar reports of
failure to meet export contracts continue in Eastern Germany, where the
annual plan for export deliveries was fulfilled only to the extent of
44% in the first 8 months of this year [1957].&#8221; In Czechoslovakia
&#8220;equally familiar complaints persist &#8211; of failure to deliver machines
and equipment of required type and quality, both to domestic users and
to export, and of shortfalls in planned supplies of rolled steel and
other foundry products.&#8221; <a id="f35" href="#n35" name="f35" target="_blank" >[35]</a></p>

<p>In the period of the first Five Year plans in the USSR, what
impressed world opinion was not only the tempo of growth which was
achieved but the coincidence of it with falling production, chronic
depression and stagnation in the capitalist world. In assessing the
full economic impact of the USSR in the coming period, therefore, it is
not only its relations with other countries and the world market which
will be significant. To a greater extent this will reside in the
possibility of economic difficulties, stagnation or even decline in the
capitalist world side by side with continued expansion in the centrally
planned economies. Then, for example, the question of the influence
which this will have, not only on the underdeveloped countries, but
also on the working class of the advanced countries becomes of
paramount importance.</p>
<p>The terms of the problems of East-West economic relationships are
simplified and vulgarized in the current propaganda of the Soviet
leadership and its faithful echoes throughout the world. In fact, far
from being straightforward, these relationships are shot through with
all the contradictions which arise from the confrontation of the two
systems resting on incompatible bases.</p>
<p>On the one hand both &#8220;camps&#8221; are part of a world market &#8211; which
asserts itself upon all countries despite political barriers. Indeed,
these two &#8220;camps&#8221; compete and conflict in and through this market &#8211; for
example to win the allegiance of &#8220;uncommitted&#8221; countries &#8211; just as they
carry on economic dealings which are mutually advantageous. But beyond
this the development of the non-capitalist segment weakens permanently
and progressively the economic and political hold of the capitalist
world system. It withdraws whole areas of the world from imperialist
exploitation. It provides a point of leverage which other peoples use
to win or extend their freedom of action.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the weakening position of capitalism, which shows
through despite the prosperous recent phase of its development, leads
individual countries to look to their own possibilities of extending
their market by trade with the Eastern bloc. This tendency has been
more pronounced precisely since the boom has shown signs of flattening
out and has even given place to the probability of recession on a world
scale. Under these conditions it becomes more difficult for a common
policy of trade embargoes and restrictions to be imposed at the command
of the USA.</p>
<p>At the same time, the economic development of the Eastern European
countries, the USSR and China proceeds amid disproportions, distortions
and sudden turns. Their productive forces expand, but not smoothly and
in a straight line. There are weak links, unsolved problems, and the
overhead of the bureaucratic political regime. A prime need is that of
increased coordination and specialization to smooth the process of
industrialization and to satisfy the demands of consumers for more
goods, greater variety and quality. The pressure towards fuller
participation in the world market follows &#8211; but not on the lines
indicated by the &#8220;peaceful coexistence&#8221; nostrum of maintenance of the <em>status
quo</em>. The 
basic issue in the long run is: Will capitalism be able to continue to
dominate the world market? This is already so apparent that even
comparatively slight encroachments by the USSR cause alarm and
speculation, especially where the &#8220;underdeveloped&#8221; countries are
concerned.</p>

<p>The working out of the issues discussed here will be inextricably
involved with all those political and economic forces determining the
fate of mankind in coming years. No tidy set of slogans can provide an
answer; but in elaborating policy for the working-class movement
careful note must obviously be taken of all the trends and
possibilities, of which some indication has been given, in order to
utilize them to the best advantage.</p>

mean &#8220;that the sphere of exploitation of the world&#8217;s resources by the
major capitalist countries (USA, Britain, France) will not expand, but
contract; that their opportunities for sale in the world market will
deteriorate, and that their industries will be operating more and more
below capacity.&#8221; Thus it was inferred that Stalin&#8217;s theory &#8220;regarding
the relative stability of markets in the period of the general crisis
of capitalism&#8221; and Lenin&#8217;s &#8220;that in spite of the decay of capitalism,

&#8216;on the whole, capitalism is growing far more rapidly than before&#8217;,&#8221;
were both now valid. See pp.34-I.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n4" href="#f4" name="n4" target="_blank" >4.</a> There have been
many discussions, about this from the Communist party standpoint in the
past decade or so. For an early example, see A. Rothstein, <em>Economic
Relationships Between the Two Worlds</em> in <strong>The Modern
Quarterly</strong>, No.4, 1951. His conclusion was that it was time to
normalize trade relations and that this should be &#8220;the particular duty
of all those engaged in trade, industry and economic studies &#8211; whatever
their political standpoint &#8211; who are concerned for the welfare of their
respective countries.&#8221; This in the leading &#8220;Marxist&#8221; theoretical
journal in Britain.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n5" href="#f5" name="n5" target="_blank" >5.</a> In the section
devoted to East-West economic relations in the <strong>Economic Survey
of Europe Since the War</strong> (1952), the Economic Commission for
Europe deplored the keeping apart of &#8220;two areas with highly
complementary production structures.&#8221; It went on to say that the
economic effects of this split are profound, as witnessed by western
Europe&#8217;s difficulties in financing food imports from overseas, and in
the strains involved in eastern industrialisation under conditions of
low imports of commodities (not to speak of capital) from outside the
area. The economic loss arising from this political split does not lend
itself to measurement?
 (P. 215) In purely &#8220;economic&#8221; terms the ECE was right &#8211; but to
sever
the economic from the &#8220;political&#8221; and regard the latter as opposing an
artificial barrier to the first was to misunderstand the whole nature
of the problem.</p>

peaceful co-existence is inconceivable without trade, which provides a
good basis for it even after the formation of two world markets.&#8221;
(Mikoyan&#8217;s emphasis) Trade would be &#8220;mutually beneficial&#8221; being
&#8220;determined by the very necessity of the social division of labour, by
the generally known fact that not all goods can be produced to the same
advantage in all countries.&#8221; <strong>Soviet News Booklet</strong>,

Bulletin for Europe</strong>, Vol.9, No.2, p.47. &#8220;Press reports
indicate substantial eastern European orders for western European
machinery during the current year [1957]. Poland, for example, has
ordered mining equipment and electrical equipment in several western
European countries. The Soviet Union is reported to have ordered
several complete industrial plants from the United Kingdom, including
one for the manufacture of rubber tires.&#8221; Total exports of machinery
from West to East totalled $150 million in 1956, but this represented
only 2.4% of total machinery exports. <strong>Ibid.</strong>, p.46.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n8" href="#f8" name="n8" target="_blank" >8.</a> This was in
Mikoyan&#8217;s mind when, in referring to the Western embargo on trade to
China, he said that this &#8220;could enable some of them [i.e., the Western
countries] to avoid curtailing production during the period of
inevitable crisis.&#8221; On the other hand. Communist party demands for
East-West trade are often couched in terms which suggest that it can
provide a specific against unemployment. While to a limited extent this
may be true, the market in the Eastern bloc could only provide an
outlet for certain countries, or parts of industry in such countries.
The basic problem of capitalist crisis still remains.</p>

were reported in <strong>The Manchester Guardian</strong>, March 31,
1958, with the comment: &#8220;The range and size of Russia&#8217;s exports of
primary materials is rapidly growing.&#8221; It was suggested that in certain
lines &#8211; raw materials, heavy industry &#8211; output had grown ahead of
ability of user industries to absorb it. The changes in the composition
of armaments was instanced as another factor.&#8221; The article concluded:

&#8220;We must expect growing Russian exports of raw materials and capital
goods, if necessary, financed by loans, credits, and aid.&#8221; Should this
influx of raw materials reach sufficient dimensions it could have a
serious effect on markets already suffering for some time from
oversupply and falling prices; and the &#8220;underdeveloped countries&#8221; would
be the first and worst affected in all probability.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n10" href="#f10" name="n10" target="_blank" >10.</a> This point
is made in virtually all studies of Russian foreign trade.</p>

Bettelheim, <strong>L&#8217;Economie Sovietique</strong>, 322.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n12" href="#f12" name="n12" target="_blank" >12.</a> <strong>Economic
Bulletin for Europe</strong>, Vol.9, No.2, Table 3. D.37. Other points
to note: &#8220;The share of western Europe in total eastern European trade
increased from only a little over 15% in 1952 to almost 19% in 1956.&#8221;
(p.36) In the world context, the <strong>World Economic Survey</strong>,
1956, reported: &#8220;Although in 1956 the value of trade of the centrally
planned economies with the rest of the world reached an all time high
of more than 5 billion dollars, it still accounted for less than 3% of
world trade ... The trade of mainland China with countries outside the
centrally planned group rose by more than one-third, and that of the
Soviet Union by nearly 30%. The trade of other eastern European
countries with the rest of the world rose by only 15%.&#8221; The increase in
the share of Western trading regions with the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe, in the <strong>Economic Survey of Europe</strong>, 1956, was
stated as &#8220;probably to be explained-largely as a result of special
difficulties in trade between east European countries and the Soviet
Union.&#8221; (p.17)</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n13" href="#f13" name="n13" target="_blank" >13.</a> According to
<strong>The Financial Times</strong>, March 25, 1958, &#8220;only a trickle&#8221;
of these orders have been received, although a billion pounds sterling
was spoken of at the time of the Bulganin-Khrushchev visit.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n14" href="#f14" name="n14" target="_blank" >14.</a> This is put
as follows in the <strong>Economic Survey of Europe</strong>, 1956:
&#8220;One effect of the Free Trade Area rules will be to make it more
difficult for west European countries to enter into trade agreements
with the countries of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union which involve
any discrimination in favour of imports from these countries as
compared with imports from other members of the area.&#8221; As Soviet trade
is carried on through bilateral agreements, the FTA would cut at the
root of East-West trade bargains. No doubt this will not at all disturb
the initiators of the BCM and FTA. It may lead, however, as the
Economic Commission suggests to an intensified trade drive by the
eastern European countries in other areas.</p>

cooperation which, according to him, was leading, until 1953, to
&#8220;autarchy and economic isolation.&#8221; He points out that successful
industrialization requires &#8220;the largest possible development of the
international division of labour within the socialist camp,&#8221; etc.</p>

see the very biased article by V. Winston in the US Information
Service&#8217;s <strong>Problems of Communism</strong>, Jan.-Feb. 1958.
According to Winston the Soviet economy will, for the future, have to
bear &#8220;the added burden of supporting a weakened satellite system&#8221; which
will constitute &#8220;a significant irritant and strain.&#8221;</p>

Survey of Asia and the Far East</strong>, 1956, for a short study of
recent trends in Chinese foreign trade. The share of Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union in Chinese trade rose from 23.4% in 1950 to about 80%
in 1954. The USSR has supplied numerous industrial plants and equipment
for state farms on long-term loans. Detailed figures of Chinese trade
are not available.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>The Economic Bulletin for Asia and the Far East</strong>,
reported that the volume of Chinese trade was expected to fall in 1957
owing to a cut in food exports.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n29" href="#f29" name="n29" target="_blank" >29.</a> By 1957 the
embargo on trade with China was becoming increasingly irksome to
Western countries. Thus Britain placed her trade with China on the same
basis as that with the rest of the Soviet orbit. (The embargo remains
on &#8220;strategic exports.&#8221;) A Commercial and Technical Mission from China
visited Britain in the winter of 1957. (See <strong>Board of Trade
Journal</strong>, March 7, 1958. ) It was reported to he willing to
purchase some &pound;700,000 of
textile machinery. But the Board of Trade Journal also noted: &#8220;Most
firms reported that a serious impediment to their prospects of
expanding their trade with China was the continuance of the strategic
embargo, and it was instructive to note in this connection that a very
wide range of the products in which the Mission was most interested
were embargoed goods.&#8221; There seems little doubt that it is only in
deference to the US State Department that these restrictions are
maintained. Without restrictions it is doubtful whether China could
afford to buy &#8220;strategic&#8221; commodities in sufficient quantities to have
any real strategic significance.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n30" href="#f30" name="n30" target="_blank" >30.</a> See, for
example, the article in <strong>The Economic Bulletin for Europe,</strong>

Vol.9 No.1, on Soviet Central Asia, which gives a balanced picture of
what has been accomplished, what remains to be done and the
deficiencies which have persisted.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n31" href="#f31" name="n31" target="_blank" >31.</a> Hence a note
of anxiety in newspaper items. Thus in <strong>The Times</strong>,
March 28, 1958, while recording that the USSR had made one hundred
agreements with underdeveloped countries in 1957, the correspondent
wrote, &#8220;It seems certain that the Soviet Government intends to win its
competition with the free world in the fields of trade and aid in the
uncommitted countries.&#8221; While insisting that so far aid from the
Western countries far exceeds that from the Soviet Union it was added
ominously that &#8220;the pace is likely to get hotter. &#8220;</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n32" href="#f32" name="n32" target="_blank" >32.</a> <em>Escape
from the Aid Maze</em>, <strong>The Economist</strong>, March 1, 1958.
There is some truth in the point made that &#8220;the Communist powers can
reap a rich propaganda harvest even from their <em>more</em> hollow
gestures.&#8221; This was demonstrated at the Cairo Conference. The Economist
does not, of course, understand why this is so. It arises essentially
from the anti-imperialism of the former colonial or semi-colonial
countries whose people hail with relief the prospect of what they view
as disinterested assistance through which they can move towards
economic emancipation. It is true that their hopes are exaggerated and
there may also be truth in what this journal of the City writes &#8211; &#8220;that
the novelty of Soviet aid is wearing off, and that the recipients are
learning to scrutinise it more carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n33" href="#f33" name="n33" target="_blank" >33.</a> Recent
Soviet sales to the Indonesian government include ships and aircraft,
the latter for use against the rebels. The State Department meanwhile
affirms that it will not sell arms to the Indonesian government and
appears to be supporting, at least morally, the reactionary military
rebellion.</p>
