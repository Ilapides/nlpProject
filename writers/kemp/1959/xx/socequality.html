<p class="c"><strong>What is the significance of the goals announced by
Khrushchev at the Twenty-First Congress? Study of the Seven Year Plan
provides illuminating data</strong></p>
<p class="fst">THE targets adopted at the Twenty-First Congress of the
Communist party of the Soviet Union are claimed not only to mark the
entry into the last leg of the race to catch up and outstrip the
advanced capitalist countries in per capita output but also to lead to
the threshold of communism. These claims need to be appraised carefully
and realistically on the basis of the present and potential capacity of
the Soviet economy, their relationship to the balance of social forces
inside the USSR and their consequences for international political
developments in the coming fifteen years.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Industrial Growth</h4>
<p class="fst">The economic tasks are defined by Khrushchev as
entailing &#8220;the all-round development of the productive forces&#8221; while
conserving the priority development of heavy industry. <a id="f1"
href="#n1" name="f1" target="_blank" >[1]</a> Indeed, capital investments provide the
limiting factor in the rate of growth of the economy and the attainment
of figures in the plan turns upon their full realization. The scope and
nature of the investments comprised in the seven-year target figures
give a fairly full guide to the way in which the economy will have to
be redirected to take advantage of what has been achieved in past
plans, as well as to make good, as rapidly as possible, the lags and
deficiencies which still hold back the Soviet economy. Without
overcoming these weaknesses it is idle to talk of &#8220;balanced
development.&#8221;</p>

<p>The range and abundance of minerals to be found in that part of the
earth&#8217;s surface within the USSR apparently ensures that the physical
possibility for the achievement of the target figures is sound enough.
However, it will be necessary to bring about considerable shifts in the
relative importance of the various areas in total output of iron ore,
petroleum and other minerals. This means further rapid development in
Central Asia, the Urals and Siberia and will involve the urbanization
of new areas and the recruitment of workers for the new enterprises
from the countryside or perhaps from Western Russia. Although there may
be disadvantages in this, it will be possible for the new productive
units to be built on an optimum scale, making use of the latest in
technology.</p>
<p>At the same time technical efficiency now imposes wider use of
alloys, especially in developing branches of industry such as
electronics. Nonferrous metal production therefore takes prominent
place in the plan. In chemicals the Soviet leadership has been
expressing dissatisfaction with output, especially of artificial and
synthetic fibres and plastics. Output of the former is to grow four
times, that of the latter to be stepped up over sevenfold. In addition,
though not mentioned by Khrushchev at the Congress, production is to be
greatly increased in East Germany and Czechoslovakia and machinery is
to be obtained from those countries. It will be recalled that machinery
for building up this lagging sector of industry was one of the items
which Khrushchev sought for purchase from the USA  in his letter to
Eisenhower in the summer of 1958.</p>
<p>Special attention is being paid to the power base, and significant
changes in the relative importance of different fuels is involved. The
share of oil and gas is to rise from 31% to 51% and that of coal to
decline correspondingly. This follows a trend already marked in the USA
and Western Europe. In the case of electric power the need for speed
has clearly dictated the preference for thermal over hydroelectric
stations. The figures announced for electric power output will bring
Soviet per capita consumption in 1965 up to only 73% of the American
level for 1957, a sobering thought which prompted Academician Strumlin
in an article published last December to query the adequacy of the plan
in this direction. <a id="f2" href="#n2" name="f2" target="_blank" >[2]</a> He also
proposed the completion of the Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric station. It is
difficult to tell whether his criticisms carried any weight in the
adopted target. Khrushchev did, however, have to explain that to keep
the existing proportions between thermal and hydroelectric station
construction would either involve a cut in the planned capacities in
operation or greatly increased investments.</p>
<p>This underlines the inevitable limiting role of investment as well
as the heavy burden of &#8220;catching up.&#8221; What it means is that the period
of planning has to be confined within a time-span which cramps the
rational allocation of resources and which threatens to provoke waste,
if not disproportions. Thus Lenin&#8217;s ideas on electrification are being
deformed to suit the specifications of &#8220;socialism in one country.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great distances of Russia and the spacing out of natural
resources and fertile and populated areas has always given the
transport system a key place in economic development. All advance
hinges upon the transport system which, if it lags behind, spreads high
costs and disorganization far and wide. The pressure on the transport
system has always been immense and it has barely kept pace with the
demands imposed upon it. Inevitably, therefore, considerable funds have
to be provided for the modernization of the railways and the extension
and improvement of the road system. The railways, again following in
the wake of the advanced countries, will be turned over to diesel and
electric propulsion, while traffic capacity is planned to double.</p>
<p>As for the road system, that has always trailed behind. For a
country of such distances and with such a large and scattered rural
population the number of motor vehicles is remarkably small; an index
of the still considerable weight of inherited backwardness. <a id="f3"
href="#n3" name="f3" target="_blank" >[3]</a></p>
<p>Likewise many of the roads are incapable of coping with the speeds
and loads of modern vehicle traffic. &#8220;Motor roads will be built with a
durable cement and concrete surface,&#8221; Khrushchev says, implying that
too many still have the rough dirt track of the days of the peasant
cart.</p>
<p>Both roads and houses consume immense quantities of concrete and
cement. The clear lag here makes necessary a gigantic target: an
increase in the next seven years equal to the present output of the USA.</p>
<p>All the constructional industries will be subjected to heavy strains
to attain such targets. Nor is it any longer merely the comparatively
crude task of adopting and assimilating a ready-make technique from the
more advanced capitalist countries. The tasks now being set are far
more delicate and difficult, involving the carrying forward of the
all-round level of technology to a higher level and fitting it to the
requirements of a planned economy. At least one element in the
reorganization of economic areas carried out in 1957 was precisely
determined by the changing level of the Soviet economy.</p>
<p>Realization of the new difficulties likely to be encountered has
evidently prompted the setting of a lower rate of growth than that
attained in the earlier five-year plans, a point which has been seized
on by most hostile critics. Khrushchev&#8217;s own words are no doubt true
enough when he states that the plan &#8220;is being drawn up in such a way
that it can be carried out without overstrain&#8221; and in order to make it
easier to avoid disproportions, the great nightmare of Soviet planners.</p>

<p>In other words, it might be said that a slackening growth rate is,
among other things, a precautionary step. The current planners and
their regime cannot in fact release all the energies inherent in a
planned and nationalized economy. They are constantly launching
broadsides against waste, neglect and mismanagement &#8211; to no apparent
avail. They are constantly exhorting one or another section of the
population to work harder and better. In words, at any rate, they pay
respects to the need for the support and active participation of the
masses. But it is clear, if only from these repeated pleadings and
warnings that they do not have, and cannot attain to this situation.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Promises of More and Better</h4>
<p class="fst">Nevertheless it is undeniable that the fruits of past
economic development are now being reaped, if still laboriously &#8211; and
if still unequally distributed. The expansion in production means that,
even with no change in the proportionate production of consumer goods,
there is more to distribute in absolute terms. The growing availability
of many goods which until recent years could not be found even in the
Moscow shops is attested to by all visitors to the Soviet Union. It is
true that they mostly tell about the capital, where per capita retail
sales may be as high as three or more times those in the provinces.
Even so, improvement has been taking place, and the insistence of the
Russian workers and peasants upon more and better consumer goods of all
kinds means that there can be no turning back. Not only that but it is
evident from the words and deeds of the Soviet tops in the past few
years that, even while defending their privileges and the prevailing
inequality in the receipt of the good things of life, they are
increasingly sensitive to criticism. To defend their order it is no
longer enough to distort Marx, it is also necessary to deliver the
goods.</p>
<p>Their ability to do this, greater than before because they now
handle an economy at a higher level of industrialization, is still
limited by many factors. Their own incomes and perquisites obviously
constitute one barrier. A closed book in the official record, for
obvious reasons, unequal distribution of the &#8220;good things of life&#8221; is
itself admitted. When Khrushchev states, however, in reply to the
unmentioned offstage critics with whom he frequently debates, that what
he calls &#8220;equalitarian Communism&#8221; <a id="f4" href="#n4" name="f4" target="_blank" >[4]</a>

&#8220;would only eat up our stockpiles, make extended reproduction
impossible and block successful expansion of the economy&#8221; he says
precisely nothing about the point at issue.</p>
<p>He seems to be trying to say that more equal distribution would mean
reduced production, but that is not necessarily so. Once a certain
volume of consumer goods production has been planned the problem is how
it shall be distributed &#8211; and that can have nothing to do with eating
up stockpiles, preventing extended reproduction or blocking economic
expansion. Perhaps the wrong things are being produced for a more
equitable distribution &#8211; too many limousines and not enough washing
machines &#8211; just because <em>incomes</em> are unequal &#8211; that is what
happens in capitalist countries; there is no doubt that it occurs in
the USSR as well.</p>

<p>In order to defend the privileges of the bureaucracy, for that is
what it amounts to, there has to be constant insistence that the actual
distribution of income follow the socialist principle of &#8220;from each
according to his abilities, to each according to his work.&#8221; The incomes
of the ruling stratum are thus assimilated to their &#8220;labor
contribution,&#8221; which it is implied, is greater than that of other
members of society. Let us leave aside here the theoretical
difficulties of reconciling this view with the claim that the USSR is
in sight of communism, and consider how Khrushchev faces up to the
critics.</p>
<p>He refers, for example, to &#8220;some scientific workers&#8221; who alleged
that &#8220;distribution according to work signifies application of bourgeois
law to Socialist society.&#8221; He wriggles round this charge by asserting
that inequality of shares are inevitable in &#8220;the first phase of
Communist society&#8221; and has nothing to do with &#8220;bourgeois law.&#8221; Either
the &#8220;scientific workers,&#8221; out of discretion, perhaps, did not state
their case very well, or, which is more probably the case, Khrushchev
has distorted it as wilfully as he distorts Marxism. Certainly, and
that is the important thing, the bourgeois norms of distribution
penetrate everywhere into Soviet society hidden behind such expressions
as &#8220;payment according to work performed&#8221; and &#8220;material incentives.&#8221; The
bad faith, bluster and apologetics of the spokesmen of the ruling group
bear witness to their bad consciences and their sensitivity to
criticism.</p>

<p>In fact it is constantly necessary to refute what the <strong>Political
Economy Textbook</strong> called the &#8220;petty bourgeois doctrine of the
equality of wages.&#8221; Doubtless no one has put forward such a demand, but
the strong current of opinion rising against special privileges and
glaring inequalities can be inferred from the space devoted in Soviet
publications to an oblique, but increasingly sophistical defense of
them. Not long ago, for example, the same Professor Ostrovityanov who
was editor-in-chief of the textbook showed signs of some second
thoughts.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;As we advance to communism,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;the gulf
between maximum and minimum wages will be reduced by further raising
the wages of the lower paid workers, which will be brought about by the
growth of production, the lowering of production costs, <em>the
cutting of the staff apparatus and the reduction of the excessively
high incomes of various groups</em>.&#8221; <a id="f5" href="#n5" name="f5" target="_blank" >[5]</a>

(My emphasis.)</p>
<p class="fst">It is not often that reference is made to &#8220;excessively
high incomes&#8221; and Khrushchev did not feel called upon, at the Congress,
to ask for any sacrifices from the assembled functionaries and members
of the staff apparatus. <a id="f6" href="#n6" name="f6" target="_blank" >[6]</a> Even
the members of the &#8220;anti-party group&#8221; were not given the severe
punishment of having their emoluments reduced to the level of the
lower-paid workers.</p>
<p>Definite promises have been made, however, to raise the wage levels
of the lower-paid grades, and what has been said about them points to
the existence of a submerged fifth of the working population still on
the standard of bare necessities. Thus it is promised that workers paid
from 270 to 350 rubles a month will be raised to 500-600 rubles over
the seven-year period. In other words there are many workers whose
day&#8217;s wages can buy no more than a quart of milk, a meter of cotton
cloth or twelve pounds of potatoes. Where there is talk of an increase
in real incomes of 40% note must be taken of the actual level of
consumption prevailing among the working class. Even a skilled worker,
taking home about 1,000 rubles a month, is not able to buy the quantity
or variety of goods available to the employed worker of comparable
skill in the advanced capitalist countries. For example, he will need
about 150 rubles for a pair of shoes (not of very good quality) and
over half a month&#8217;s pay to acquire a bicycle. <a id="f7" href="#n7"
name="f7" target="_blank" >[7]</a> No doubt he will be adequately fed, with the help of
cheap meals in the factory, but his standards are still creeping up
rather slowly &#8211; and far from fast enough to satisfy his aspirations.</p>

<p>To counter this, Khrushchev has to emphasize the importance of
&#8220;social income&#8221; not included in the wage and maintain the dogma of an
actual increasing pauperization of workers and peasants under
capitalism. In fact income levels so far attained, or even to be
reached in seven years, if all goes according to plan, hardly make good
the claim to have built &#8220;socialism,&#8221; let alone to be on the threshold
of communism. Abundance has not yet come for the Soviet working class,
nor is it around the corner as long as inequalities of an injustifiable
kind exist and the bureaucracy itself, through its domestic and foreign
policies, stands in the way of a more rational utilization of resources.</p>
<p>Consumption has risen, and will rise, there is no doubt about that.
Continued advance will have a particularly great impression, as in the
past, on the peoples of the underdeveloped countries, there is no
doubt about that either. Nevertheless, as the working class in the
Soviet Union imposes an improvement in its living conditions, as it
grows in skill and self-confidence, so it will desire more and faster
improvement, an end to bureaucratic privileges and an actual, not a nominal, place
as the leading force in the state and in society.</p>
<p>Even the realization of the promises on consumption could not
forestall this deep-running social process, but only speed it up.
Moreover, the antagonism between accumulation and consumption continues
to have profound consequences for Soviet economic development and
social relations.</p>

<p>In relation to consumption a word needs to be said about housing.
Despite the pace of new construction &#8211; which opens up further
possibilities for inequality in the distribution of &#8220;the good things of
life&#8221; &#8211; there is still a chronic shortage of house space. In many towns
the actual level of overcrowding is hardly less than in 1928 and the
further expansion of the economy, requiring movement into the towns, as
well as prospective increases in population, mean that a good deal of
new housing construction will be needed actually just to keep pace with
demand.</p>
<p>The target figure set is &#8220;to bring about a change in housing
distribution, that of providing a separate flat for each family,&#8221; and
not on a very lavish scale either. No wonder that Soviet citizens, to
escape the squalor and overcrowding of their home life, spend a good
deal of their recreational time on the streets or in other public
places. <a id="f8" href="#n8" name="f8" target="_blank" >[8]</a> How much better off
they will be in respect to housing in seven years largely remains to be
seen, but it is doubtful whether what is achieved will measure up, in
respect to quantity and quality of living space for the ordinary
family, to the demands of socialism. <a id="f9" href="#n9" name="f9" target="_blank" >[9]</a>

In any case housing and its corollary, the furniture and domestic
equipment industries, will absorb considerable resources, and
consequently limit the expansion possible in other sectors. It will
certainly be impossible to cut back on the housing program without
raising the ire of the Soviet people.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Peasantry and the Plan</h4>
<p class="fst">Since the slashing exposure of the defects of Soviet
agriculture which he made in the stocktaking that followed Stalin&#8217;s
death in 1953, Khrushchev has been associated with a succession of
spectacular policy changes. The virgin lands campaign, the planting of
corn, the promises about meat and milk production, the sale of
machinery by the Machine Tractor Stations to the collective farms, new
policies on purchasing and on prices &#8211; these represent so many gambles
designed to extricate agriculture from its stagnation, increase urban
food supplies and win the good will of the peasantry. Khrushchev&#8217;s
personal reputation is more closely tied up with these than perhaps
with any other part of government policy of recent years and his clash
with the Malenkov-Molotov faction seems to have been a result in large
part of their doubts about such innovations.</p>
<p>To draw up a full balance sheet of Khrushchev&#8217;s policies will be
possible only at the end of the Seven Year Plan. Results in agriculture
take time to prove themselves, especially when they concern measures of
such immense scope. It can be taken that the main lines of approach to
agriculture have been established for the next few years and will only
be disturbed by an <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">untoward
</span></span>event or by their failure to do what is expected of them.</p>
<p>So far Khrushchev has been favored by the context within which he is
operating. In 1953 agriculture was in a serious impasse. The peasantry
was resentful, food shortage endemic and bad harvests could still spell
disaster. According to Khrushchev, Malenkov was responsible for a gross
overestimation of grain production and Beria for the sorry state of
livestock production. As compared with 1910-14, the period 1949-53
showed scarcely any increase in sown areas, crop fields and grain
returns &#8220;though,&#8221; Khrushchev asserts, &#8220;in numerical strength the
population, and especially that of the industrial centers and cities,
had considerably increased, and the state&#8217;s grain requirements were
immeasurably greater than those of Czarist Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>No doubt to shed contempt on his predecessors &#8211; the great culprit,
after all, being Joseph Stalin, who was said never to have visited a
collective farm &#8211; Khrushchev overcolors the picture and depicts his own
retrieval of the situation as all the greater by comparison. <a
id="f10" href="#n10" name="f10" target="_blank" >[10]</a> There has been no miracle,
but by dint of great efforts &#8211; including much time and energy on his
own part &#8211; the peasant has been cajoled and encouraged into producing
more.</p>
<p>Khrushchev is able to claim big increases in output over the past
five years, part of which is attributable to a measure of luck. <a
id="f11" href="#n11" name="f11" target="_blank" >[11]</a> But big concessions have had
to be made to the peasants. Furthermore, as far as grain production is
concerned, a considerable contribution has been made by the once virgin
lands. Not only has the supply of such areas diminished, but those in
cultivation are subject to lower yields and the risks of drought. <a
id="f12" href="#n12" name="f12" target="_blank" >[12]</a> In other words, it is from
the collective farms that the great additions to output necessary to
fulfill the Seven Year Plan must largely come, by higher yields per
acre and by increasing the number and improving the quality of farm
animals. This involves immense new investments in agriculture, an
increase in the supply of agronomists and technicians and improvements
in farm management and cost controls.</p>

<p>Emphasis on technique and organization will be inadequate unless the
peasants can be won for complete confidence in, and co-operation with,
the ruling power. But the collective farm peasantry has a will of its
own. Besides, the twenty million or so peasant households by no means
form a homogeneous group. There are rich peasants, such as the cotton
farmers of Central Asia with their cars and good frame houses; and poor
peasants, even around Moscow, who prefer to migrate to the cities. <a
id="f13" href="#n13" name="f13" target="_blank" >[13]</a> Differences in income and
influence run through the collective farms as well. Concessions to the
strong peasants may not suit those on the poorer farms, and so on. <a
id="f14" href="#n14" name="f14" target="_blank" >[14]</a></p>
<p>A big problem is that of the collective farmers&#8217; private plots.
These plots were conceded after the first mass collectivization drive
of the 1930&#8217;s had fanned revolt in the villages. Since the war they
have diminished in size but still provide an important addition to the
family income of the peasants, as well as some office and factory
workers. Peasant individualism, still strong because of mistrust of the
regime, plus the general low level of living has caused the private
plots to be worked to the utmost, while the work on the collective
farms has been half-hearted. The peasants&#8217; own plots and animals
continue to provide an important addition to the food supply, and
wistful gazes are cast at the contrasts between the intensity of work
put in them compared with that in the collective. On the one hand the
plots are necessary, and at least have to be recognized &#8211; the market
for private produce has now been made completely free; i.e., no more
obligatory deliveries. At the same time, no occasion is lost to point
out that it is really to the advantage of the peasants (the peasant
women in particular) to merge their fields and animals with the
resources of the collective farms.</p>
<p>As part of the progress towards communism, it is argued, not only
the private plots but also the collective farms themselves must be
merged into an integral form of state property. <a id="f15" href="#n15"
name="f15" target="_blank" >[15]</a> To speed up matters, some officials, who earned
the appropriate rebukes, have put pressure on the peasants to surrender
their private plots. For the moment the problem still remains on the
agenda. The peasantry as a whole appears to take the concessions
offered it with both hands, but to be reluctant to accept changes which
might mean a weakening of its position. It understands what Khrushchev
means by material incentives, because the bureaucracy itself &#8211;

including that on the farms &#8211; enjoys these in full measure and it wants
to do likewise. When it comes to Khrushchev&#8217;s theoretical propositions
it is not so interested &#8211; unless they can be linked with real
improvements too; and there is obviously still plenty of skepticism.
But this represents not only the legacy of Stalinism in the village, it
also flies in the face of the claim to have built socialism. The
peasant question in Russia has still not been solved; and this fact
makes problematical the achievement of the target figures set for
agricultural production.</p>
<p>It is, however, more than a question of increasing the food supply &#8211;
much as that is imperative to meet the expectations of urban consumers
&#8211; it is also one of social and political power relations. Relatively,
too, the proportion of the population engaged in agriculture in the
USSR is excessive; it represents a factor of backwardness which bears
down upon the per capita income figures of the population as a whole.
It means, further, that the peasantry remains a powerful social force.
It has to be reckoned with, maneuvered this way and that and used,
where necessary, as a counterweight to the working class.</p>
<p>The bureaucracy, despite Khrushchev&#8217;s muddled theoretical effusions,
remains quite empirical in its approach to the peasant. It makes
sweeping concessions at the same time that it reminds the peasants of
the leading role of the working class (your &#8220;elder brother,&#8221; Khrushchev
recently told the peasants of Ryazan, completely reversing the sequence
of class development). Behind the abstraction &#8220;the working class&#8221; lurks
the will of the bureaucracy intimating to the peasants, &#8220;Play ball with
me and I&#8217;ll play ball with you; if not, concessions may shrink.&#8221;<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Challenge to Capitalism</h4>
<p class="fst">What remains when the layer of propagandistic
exaggeration and theoretical distortion surrounding the record and
future prospects of the Soviet economy is stripped off is a testimony
to the capacity of planning to transform a backward country into an
industrial giant. During the 1970&#8217;s &#8211; if targets are reached &#8211; per
capita output will begin to overhaul that of the United States, and the
Soviet Union will have become the foremost industrial country.
Economists and politicians in the capitalist countries, while casting
doubt on this or that portion of the plan targets, are still digesting
the significance of this prospect.</p>
<p>The current appears to be flowing swiftly in favor of Khrushchev and
Company. But the deep undertow which the rate and extent of the changes
taking place in the USSR generate in fact makes it ever more difficult
for them to keep their feet. They cannot master the forces which they
have unleashed; behind their confidence is an acute awareness of storms
and stresses in prospect both at home and abroad as a result of Soviet
successes. Hesitation and switches in policy, wide divergences of
interest and outlook within the ruling group and the main themes of
propaganda and policy indicate such awareness.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Soviet Union is no longer in capitalist encirclement,&#8221;
announces Khrushchev, the theoretician. &#8220;We shall be able to repel any
attack by any enemy,&#8221; proclaims Khrushchev, the practical man. &#8220;The
triumph of socialism is not only complete but final,&#8221; the theoretician
goes on; &#8220;the question of building Socialism is one country has been
decided by the course of the historical development of society.&#8221; &#8220;As
long as capitalism exists there may always be people who, contrary to
common sense, will want to launch out on a hopeless venture&#8221; (i.e., war
against the Soviet Union), says the man-in-charge.</p>

<p>Such confusion of thought, like the attribution to Lenin of the
theory of &#8220;socialism in one country,&#8221; is only to be expected from one
who is primarily concerned with protecting the position of the caste he
represents and who selects bits and pieces from Marxism as occasion
demands.</p>
<p>The facts show that the nature of Soviet society is still
transitional. The targets set for the next seven years are a clear
refutation of the claim to have built socialism. The &#8220;abundance&#8221; of
which Khrushchev speaks is still ahead and looks suspiciously like an
output per head no greater than in advanced capitalist countries today.
For the present it is still a &#8220;socialism&#8221; that can guarantee materially
little more than the necessary minimum for the mass of the people, and
with the minimum in some spheres low indeed.</p>
<p>On the political side the claim is no better grounded. To the
question, &#8220;Who rules?&#8221; the official doctrine replies with a tissue of
sophistries. The working class is promised benefits, told to be
inspired by the economic achievements of the USSR and to give active
participation in carrying out plans; that it has entered into its
heritage and now rules the state no one can believe. The elaborate
pretense of nationwide discussions of theses sent down from the Central
Committee of the CPSU enables the popular pulse to be felt and minor
changes to be made. In practice firm and narrow limits are set to
dissidence &#8211; imposed by the antagonisms inherent in a society in which
indefensible disparities in income and power still exist. In short,
decisions are made at the top, there is no real democracy in the sense
of responsibility from the top to the bottom.</p>

<p>Of course, since 1953, and more rapidly since 1956, there has been a
rationalization of procedures made necessary by social forces and made
possible by economic improvement. The arbitrary repression of the
Stalin era would now be intolerable. The old strict curbs on
consumption by the masses can now to some extent be dispensed with.
Life is easier, tension has relaxed. The coercive apparatus is no
longer a blind power, striking into the ranks of the bureaucracy
itself. It is now a conscious force, subdued and less obtrusive
(&#8220;socialist legality&#8221;). Nevertheless, tense conflicts are still fought
out behind closed doors, revealed as and when the victor deems
expedient and in such a way as to leave the defeated no possibility of
stating their case. The &#8220;anti-party group&#8221; then provides a convenient
scapegoat for anything which has been going wrong and members of the
lower echelons of party and state hasten to add their obloquy to that
already heaped on once powerful figures.</p>
<p>The ways of &#8220;liberalization&#8221; are indeed mysterious to behold &#8211; but
not impossible to explain, once it is understood that there has been no
real shift in power, only a change in the balance of forces. The ruling
bureaucracy retains power through all mutations and has no intention of
relinquishing it or sharing it. But the very economic expansion which
it is obliged to promote strengthens the hand of the working class and
undermines its own position.</p>
<p>The external policy of the Soviet leadership is composed of a
complex combination of strength and weakness, of bluster and caution,
of desire for peace and fear of war, of a special theory of capitalist
&#8220;collapse&#8221; with anxiety for a deal with the capitalist states.</p>

<p>Completely missing is any reliance on the working-class movement in
the capitalist countries to overcome capitalism and take power. The
Seven Year Plan is spoken of as &#8220;a powerful moral supp</span>ort for the
international workers&#8217; and Communist movement.&#8221; At the same time the
&#8220;socialist&#8221; and capitalist systems are to expose their wares and the
peoples are to &#8220;choose.&#8221; How and under what conditions is not made
clear. If the statements of Mikoyan are to be taken at their face value
a new version of &#8220;Marxism&#8221; has been adopted in which the capitalists
are going to improve the lot of their workers in order to prevent them
from wishing to emulate the USSR. Fresh from his American trip, Mikoyan
went on the Congress platform to say that improving living standards
would increase the power of attraction of &#8220;the land of Soviets&#8221; and, he
added, this &#8220;will be indirectly instrumental in improving the condition
of the working people in the capitalist countries, for it will inspire
them to still more effective struggle against their exploiters and will
make it easier for them to wage this struggle as it will compel the
capitalists to make concessions to the working class and to the
peasantry and to do something to improve their lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little more crass than the platitudes of Khrushchev, and perhaps
closer to the real nature of Soviet international policy, Foreign
Minister Gromyko, for instance, considered that the continued economic
advance of the USSR &#8220;changes the correlation of world forces and puts
the policy of peaceful coexistence on a new and still firmer
foundation.&#8221; Nevertheless, he went on to speak of the new military
treaties directed against the USSR, the feverish efforts to increase
the number of nuclear and missile bases aimed at the USSR and the
unwillingness of the Western powers to reach an agreement on nuclear
weapons and the use of outer space. He described this as representing
the hopes of &#8220;certain influential circles&#8221; that &#8220;it may somehow be
possible to turn back the wheel of history ...&#8221; Gromyko was confident,
however, that &#8220;the ground was slipping away from under their feet&#8221; and
realization of the need for peaceful coexistence was growing and such
trends would be met halfway by the Soviet government.</p>
<p>Such is the overt policy of the USSR. It can only mean a willingness
to reach an understanding with capitalism which, in fact, would entail
its indefinite existence. &#8220;Peace-loving&#8221; capitalists are to be
supported against warmongers. Agreements are to be reached on nuclear
disarmament and other matters. Trade between the &#8220;world socialist
system&#8221; and capitalist countries will be welcomed, in accordance with
the reinstated principle of the international division of labor. <a
id="f16" href="#n16" name="f16" target="_blank" >[16]</a> It is a reasonable deduction
that working-class initiative to overthrow capitalism is not favored,
for that would rear up powerful social and political forces which the
bureaucracy could not control and which would reverberate throughout
Eastern Europe, the USSR and China.</p>

<p>If the latter possibility throws up innumerable undesirable
possibilities, a deal with capitalism, brought about by a measured
mixture of flexibility, firmness and bluff, can only have advantages,
the bureaucrats reason.</p>
<p>Above all, diminution of the foreign threat would enable full
concentration on economic tasks and would bring considerable prestige
to the ruling group itself. Reduction of armaments would be a positive
advantage of great importance to the USSR, though not to the capitalist
countries. More resources would become available which could then be
deployed as circumstances warrant between investment, consumption and
aid to underdeveloped countries. This would also mean fewer risks of
strain as the plan proceeds.</p>
<p>Likewise, there can be no doubt that a political understanding with
the main capitalist states would permit fuller participation in the
international division of labor. The USSR would thus be able to obtain
equipment for which otherwise heavy investment will have to be made and
from which results, in the shape of consumer goods adequate to satisfy
the appetite of the population, might not otherwise be forthcoming for
six or seven years. While it is true that the USSR demonstrates mastery
of the most advanced techniques in some spheres, in others there is
still backwardness &#8211; freer intercourse with the capitalist states could
help here too. Likewise, it might be expedient to import some consumer
goods directly from the manufacturers in the capitalist world who
possess many advantages in efficiency and price, not to speak of
quality.</p>
<p>Such is the attractive vista which peaceful coexistence presents.
Meanwhile, it is hoped, the balance of advantage will tilt steadily in
the direction of the USSR and its allies of the &#8220;socialist camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are, however, a number of omissions from this estimate of
future prospects. Even Khrushchev and Gromyko know full well that there
are, in the West, sections of the ruling class who would prefer to see
an attack on the USSR despite the frightful risks and undoubted heavy
costs of a nuclear war. There is no guarantee that &#8220;the peace-loving
forces&#8221; will win &#8211; if it is left to the capitalists. That goes likewise
for the Communist parties &#8211; in the USA a discredited fragment, in
Western Europe a declining force for a whole decade.</p>

<p>The growing challenge of Soviet economic strength is just as likely
to increase hostility in the capitalist ruling classes as to impress
them with the need for a deal; and if they make a deal they, in turn,
will require concessions ...</p>
<p>The effect, too, of the changing relationship of world forces will,
as Khrushchev suggests, stimulate the colonial liberation movement.
Eventually, and perhaps the time is not distant, the colonial
revolution will pass beyond the control of the national bourgeoisies,
so far largely supported by the Moscow bureaucracy. At the same time,
the all-round weakening of capitalism which can be expected, and to
which the growth of the Soviet economy contributes, provides the basis
for the intervention of the working class outside, and against, the
control of the official Communist parties. The repercussions this would
have within the USSR have already been indicated.</p>

report, <em>Results of the Development of Agriculture in the Past Five
Years</em>, made to the plenum of the Central Committee Dec. 15, 1958.
This is an attempt to vindicate his policies through reference to
increases in crop areas, farm animals and yields. The &#8220;anti-party
group&#8221; is accused of having opposed all these policies, of not
understanding agriculture and of having had &#8220;a wrong attitude to the
peasantry, regarding it as a force resisting the building of socialism.&#8221;</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n11" href="#f11" name="n11" target="_blank" >11.</a> But perhaps
not. When a representative from the Stavropol region claimed a two and
one-half increase in maize production in 1958 as compared with 1953
before the Central Committee, Khrushchev intervened. &#8220;In 1958,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;you sowed part of the maize on top of winter grain which had
perished, and you got a good crop. One might say that you would not
have been lucky if bad luck hadn&#8217;t helped. So God helped you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n12" href="#f12" name="n12" target="_blank" >12.</a> <strong>The
Economic Survey of Europe</strong>, 1957, mentioned as disadvantages of
the virgin lands the need for more fertilizers (this links up clearly
with the strain on the chemical industry), heavy ancillary investment
and the patchy nature of the soil, giving stalks of uneven length and
reducing the efficiency of combine harvesting. Khrushchev claims a big
success not only because they have been decisive in increasing grain
production but also since they have been &#8220;a major source of state
accumulation.&#8221;</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n13" href="#f13" name="n13" target="_blank" >13.</a> During his
election speech in Moscow, March 1958, Khrushchev spoke of industrial
executives who recruited workers for &#8220;rough&#8221; work from other areas,
presumably the surrounding countryside.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n14" href="#f14" name="n14" target="_blank" >14.</a> Differences
between the income of peasants on different farms can hardly fail to
increase since the farms took over (or rather bought) the machinery
formerly held by the Machine Tractor Stations.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n15" href="#f15" name="n15" target="_blank" >15.</a> Production
on the state farms is cheaper than that on the collectives: hence (a)
the emphasis on increasing productivity in the latter, and (b) the
suggestion that collective and state property should be merged.
Khrushchev says this is &#8220;historically inevitable&#8221; &#8211; thus squaring
himself with theory and trying to satisfy those who believe he is
leaning too far towards the peasants. In the meantime, to win the
peasants to increase yields, he has to take practical steps tending in
the opposite direction. He steers a tricky course.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n16" href="#f16" name="n16" target="_blank" >16.</a> &#8220;The Soviet
Union is in favor of an international division of labor, not only

the higher the industrial standard of a country, the greater is its
need and possibility for extensive foreign trade.&#8221; <strong>Idem</strong>.</p>
