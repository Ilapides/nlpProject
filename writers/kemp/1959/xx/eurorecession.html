<p class="c"><strong>America&#8217;s recession terrified capitalists in
Europe. But the dreaded impact has not been felt as yet. A Marxist
explains why</strong></p>
<p class="fst">ONE of the most significant aspects of the American
recession of 1957-58 was the attention which it received in the
European press. Even before it became clear that it was to be the most
acute since the war, it had probably occupied more space in the press,
especially in Britain, than the two previous postwar recessions
together.</p>
<p>The defenders and beneficiaries of capitalism in Europe began to lay
bare some of the anxiety which had been dormant during the great boom
era. Some resentment against the transatlantic big brother, whose every
minor ailment was liable to afflict its weaker brethren with
debilitating disease, was to be detected. Others sought in the lessons
of the past the key to the &#8220;American Enigma&#8221; <a id="f1" href="#n1"
name="f1" target="_blank" >[1]</a> and some dire predictions were circulating by
midsummer, 1958, even in the sober pages of United Nations
publications. It is true that all good men accepted that a recurrence
of anything like the depression of the 1930&#8217;s was out of the question. <a
id="f2" href="#n2" name="f2" target="_blank" >[2]</a> But if their arguments were
subjected to rational appraisal it could be seen that faith played an
important role in them.</p>

<p>As it happened, of course, more by good luck than judgment, the
predictions of numerous economists on both sides of the Atlantic that
the recession would be sharp but short seems to have been confirmed.
The revival currently proceeding could be a mere respite before a more
drastic downward plunge; such things have happened before. On the other
hand the prospect of a renewed powerful upswing, based on a high level
of new business investment, seems improbable for the moment. It seems
unlikely, therefore, that the European economy will, in the coming
months, receive much impetus from the United States; if anything the
situation on this side of the Atlantic is likely to set limits to the
extent of American recovery.</p>
<p>Both segments of world capitalism are in positions today somewhat
unlike anything predicted. How did this occur? Even those who were
confident that the recession in the USA would not be prolonged, often
tended to be gloomy about its impact upon the rest of the capitalist
world. Thus a long, leading article in the London <strong>Economist</strong>,
regarded as an organ of City business, put forward a series of detailed
proposals intended to deal with the threatened shortage of dollars
consequent upon the recession. <a id="f3" href="#n3" name="f3" target="_blank" >[3]</a>
Dollar injections into the world economy on a sufficient scale to
prevent the volume of world trade being curtailed were to be effected
either directly or through the underwriting of the Sterling Area and
the turning of the International Monetary Fund into a &#8220;super central
bank&#8221; well supplied with dollars. A heartfelt appeal to &#8220;economists in
the American administration&#8221; to &#8220;start working on the minds of the
non-economists among their colleagues&#8221; concluded the article, which
reflected the prevalent anxiety in business circles at the time of its
appearance in May 1958.</p>

<p>In the following month the <strong>Economic Bulletin for Europe</strong>
contained a highly technical article on <em>The International Impact
of the United States Recession</em> which made less specific proposals
but was based on similar premises. <a id="f4" href="#n4" name="f4" target="_blank" >[4]</a>
That is, a chronic shortage of dollars was in the offing and if world
capitalism was not to be severely shaken by the inevitable trade
contraction which would ensue, the United States should &#8220;take part in
arrangements designed to alleviate the impact of the recession on
international liquidity.&#8221; And these &#8220;would be needed even if domestic
action were to be taken in the near future to raise demand in the
United States.&#8221; There was another alternative to which the authors of
the article pointed: &#8220;concerted action by the industrialized countries
of western Europe to maintain high levels of output and trade in the
international economy outside the United States.&#8221; <a id="f5" href="#n5"
name="f5" target="_blank" >[5]</a> And this would entail some measure of discrimination
against imports from that country.</p>

<p>The Labour party&#8217;s economic program, published in July, while seeing
the &#8220;possibility of a world slump arising out of the present American
recession,&#8221; evaded the question of how its effects in Britain could be
countered. The main line of defense suggested was the restriction of
dollar imports; i.e., discriminatory practices hardly to the liking of
the US government. <a id="f6" href="#n6" name="f6" target="_blank" >[6]</a> Clearly the
authors of this document sincerely hoped that the danger would never
have to be faced. Not long before, one of the Bank reviews, discussing
possibilities for government action to maintain home demand, added that
it was &#8220;certain that the UK could not hope to spend itself out of a
serious American recession.&#8221; <a id="f7" href="#n7" name="f7" target="_blank" >[7]</a></p>
<p>From about May 1958 an undercurrent of serious doubt crept into
discussion of the American recession for several months, especially in
Britain which was particularly vulnerable to cold blasts blowing in
from a disorganized world economy.</p>

<h4>Precarious Equilibrium</h4>
<p class="fst">The reason for the anxiety was that even before the
recession began European capitalism faced the prospect of a serious
recession of its own. <a id="f8" href="#n8" name="f8" target="_blank" >[8]</a> In both
the previous postwar recessions in the United States powerful upward
movements had persisted in most European countries. Then, throughout
the 1950&#8217;s, Europe had experienced a surge forward of investment and
production with a classic capitalist boom superimposed upon a high
level of activity generated by armaments and other state expenditures.
As a consequence there was a strong pull on the industries producing
means of production both to expand their own capacity and to equip the
industries turning out consumer goods. The extent of this investment
boom differed in each country, being generally most rapid and
far-reaching where wartime destruction and previous underinvestment had
left a terrific backlog of investment opportunities, which, in the
favorable conditions of an expanding world market and technological
change, could be profitably exploited.</p>
<p>In the nature of things such a boom tends to exhaust itself &#8211; rising
costs cut into profits, some sectors of industry grow
disproportionately and markets tend to become saturated. Already during
1956 the rate of expansion had slackened and in many countries it
slackened still further in 1957. <a id="f9" href="#n9" name="f9" target="_blank" >[9]</a>
During 1958 a distinct contraction was perceptible in Britain, Belgium
and the Netherlands and was incipient in a number of other countries.
The emphasis of economic policy had shifted from coping with the
inflation and recurrent pressures on the balance of payments, which had
accompanied the boom, to the problems involved in utilizing capacity
and maintaining the rate of new investment. Not only did the American
recession threaten to confront the European countries with a new
shortage of dollars to maintain their external trade but it could
precipitate a sharp and perhaps uncontrollable plunge in domestic
activity.</p>
<p>Despite the rapid recovery of the capitalist world market since the
war, largely made possible by dollar injections through the Marshall
Plan and other American aid programs, it is still in precarious
equilibrium. The disproportion between the United States and the rest
of that market still remains. It shows itself in the dependence of the
other countries upon their ability to earn dollars for essential
payments in the USA. And most capitalist countries &#8211; Western Germany is
the main exception in Europe &#8211; have very slender reserves available to
cushion adverse changes in their own balance of payments. The fear of a
repetition of the 1940&#8217;s, with their chronic dollar deficits, hangs
over foreign economic policy. Hence the measures taken by the British
government in September 1957 to meet a drain of sterling, though that
meant dampening down business activity at home. Hence, too, the
measures proposed in many quarters during 1958 to meet the apparently
imminent all-round shortage of dollars expected to be a consequence of
the US recession.</p>

<p>The boom in the industrial countries was closely interlocked with
the growth in their foreign trade, including increasing trade amongst
themselves and with the USA. The expansion of demand from the primary
producing countries consequent upon this boom in turn reinforced it.
For some time before 1957, however, commodity prices had been falling,
raising the prospect that within a foreseeable time they would have to
curtail their imports from the industrial countries &#8211; setting in train,
or contributing to, a contraction in world trade and depression in the
industrial countries. The US recession introduced a new fear, that of
further pressure on commodity prices by reason of the lower demand for
imports, likewise playing back upon the industrial countries.</p>
<p>Such expectations had shown themselves to be only partly valid in
the previous US recessions. As it happened in 1957-58 a number of other
factors entered the picture, obscuring the clear-cut outlines that had
been expected or feared. In fact the manifold relationships of the
capitalist world economy do not lend themselves to mechanical
representation as a series of two-way transactions or cause-and-effect
sequences. They are inherently dialectical in their complex
interactions; shot through with unevenness and contradictions.
Moreover, each boom-slump cycle in capitalist development shows its
special features: the effect of technology, harvest variations, wars
and war preparations are among the factors which may impose variants on
the abstract theoretical pattern. The resultant for any particular
national economy of the happenings in the world market &#8211; to which it
contributes in greater or lesser degree &#8211; are not easily deduced from
the original elements. Thus, for example, a recession in the United
States will not have easily predictable results on other countries. A
good deal will depend upon the nature and extent of the recession, as
well as upon the point at which it impinges upon the latter, whether
they are booming, as in 1953-54, or on the threshold of contraction as
during 1958. Likewise experience shows, as will be seen, that a
downturn in the USA does not necessarily aggravate the outstanding
economic problems of other countries. Some may, at any rate for a time,
derive more good than harm from the fact.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Why They Escaped</h4>
<p class="fst">The most direct way in which the recession could have
made its impact upon the European economy was through a fall in US
demand for its exports. All the main European producers have made
special drives in recent years to extend their direct sales in the
expanding American market, with not inconsiderable success. Had these
sales dropped, the effect on the industries most concerned would have
been severe. No doubt there would be a time lag until pre-recession
orders had been fulfilled, but repeats could have expected to be lower.
In fact, however, while some European exports did fall off others rose,
making possible an overall increase for the first nine months of 1958.</p>
<p>The key to this unexpected outcome lies in the nature of the US
recession to date. The main brunt fell on investment outlays,
inventories, industrial production, business profits and employment,
all spread unevenly over the economy. On the other hand, though
consumer demand ceased to rise as it had been doing during the previous
period, and even fell back a little in per capita terms, the aggregate
level of consumption fell by no more than about one per cent. If
European exports had entered the circuit of exchange via the production
of means of production (Department I) as raw steel, heavy machinery,
machine tools and raw materials, they would have felt the full blast of
the reduction of American industrial activity. Indeed, since imports
from Europe would have tended to be the first to be cut the effect
would have assumed an exaggerated form; Europe would
have become a depressed area. As it is, comparatively few European
exports pass through those parts of the economy most severely affected
by the recession. A considerable part enter more or less directly into
the consumption stream, either in competition with the American-made
article or as non-competitive specialties. The maintenance of
consumption meant that their market was preserved, especially as they
were not generally the kind of goods consumed by workers most affected
by unemployment and short time.</p>

<p>Had the recession become increasingly virulent during the second
part of 1958 there is no doubt that these favorable conditions would
have been in jeopardy. Consumption would have fallen, and had it
reached the higher income levels, European imports might have been
severely affected. In addition, had higher tariffs been imposed under
pressure from American manufacturers, or had they switched successfully
to compete with the imported article, a valuable market might have been
greatly reduced.</p>
<p>A special factor of considerable force was the ability of European
automobile manufacturers not merely to maintain, but greatly to
increase, the volume of their sales, despite the depression in the
American industry. Not only did that mean valuable dollar earnings; but it
contributed to the high prosperity of the European car industry which,
both through its heavy investment outlays and its rising production
figures, had been a star performer in the boom of the fifties. <a
id="f10" href="#n10" name="f10" target="_blank" >[10]</a></p>
<p>The behavior of American consumption was clearly a vital factor in
preventing direct contagion of the European industrial countries. At
the same time, the influence of American conditions on already existing
world trends contributed to easing rather than intensifying their
dollar problem as had been expected. It is true that these expectations
had foundation in the light of the experience of the latter part of
1957 when there was some constriction of the flow of dollars into the
world economy. Thanks to the maintenance of American consumption,
decline of exports and continued foreign investment there was no
overall shortage of dollars in the course of 1958.</p>
<p>As far as the industrial countries of Europe were concerned, the
main operative factor was a continued improvement in their terms of
trade as the prices of primary products continued on their downward
course &#8211; assisted on their way by the fall in American demand.
Consequently, coincidental with the recession in 1958, has gone a
strengthening in their balance of payments, and additions have been
made to their international liquidity in the shape of gold and dollar
reserves despite a falling off in world trade. <a id="f11" href="#n11"

<p class="fst">This process has imposed a serious strain on the primary
producers, more particularly those whose staple exports have been
subject to marked declines in world prices. Some have been running
heavy deficits in their current balance of payments, drawing down
reserves of foreign exchange previously accumulated in other centers,
London in particular. Loans and credits from various sources, including
the United States, have enabled them to go on buying from the
industrial countries. In general, however, their position has become
more precarious and will be made even more so to the extent that
production falls in Europe. At any rate the industrial countries of
Europe have automatically profited from their embarrassments up to now.
Unless the recent slight recovery in primary product prices is
confirmed and continues for some time, or further injections of foreign
aid can be obtained, some of the underdeveloped countries will have to
make cuts in imports and impose further trade restrictions. The
attractions of trade with, or aid from, the Soviet Union will increase.
The recent agreement between Argentina and the USSR is but another sign
of the times, for Latin America is a comparatively new field for such
deals as far as the latter is concerned. <a id="f12" href="#n12"
name="f12" target="_blank" >[12]</a> It is noteworthy that business representatives of
Germany, France, Britain and other countries have been scouring the
region for years in an effort to extend their trade; rivalries would
certainly intensify if Europe&#8217;s difficulties increase.</p>

<p>Up to the last quarter of 1958 the American recession has had few
appreciable effects on European capitalism and may even have
temporarily alleviated some of its more pressing problems. The fears
which were so widespread a few months ago have tended to be dissipated.
Confidence seems to have been favorably influenced by the behavior of
Wall Street prices as well as by the easier foreign exchange position.
The usual seasonal pressure on sterling, for example, did not occur
this year; instead there has been an unusually high surplus on the
balance of payments. Nevertheless, in Britain, Belgium, the
Netherlands, and to some extent in France, recession is either
developing or is feared.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Respite for How Long?</h4>
<p class="fst">The threat to the equilibrium of the world market, and,
even more dangerously, to the very survival of capitalism which would
have followed upon a severe American slump spreading out on a world
scale seems to have receded into the background for the moment. The
spokesmen for European business are visibly relieved. Now they are
wondering what sort of respite they have secured. As one of them wrote
recently:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Europe has so far remained largely insulated from
American developments. Unfortunately it looks as though she will
continue to be so in the immediate future, for it is unlikely that the
American recovery will produce a rapid improvement in the economic
climate here.&#8221; <a id="f13" href="#n13" name="f13" target="_blank" >[13]</a></p>
<p class="fst">In other words, a number of European countries &#8211; West
Germany seems the most important exception at present &#8211; are facing
their own recession unaided by any powerful uplift from a full-scale
expansion across the water. In this negative sense the American
recession has had an important bearing on the situation of European
capitalism. The mere failure of the United States to continue its boom
through 1957-58 may deprive Europe of the spur it needed, and still
needs, to prevent it from lapsing into a comatose state of
semi-stagnation, symptoms of which have been apparent in Britain for
some time. <a id="f14" href="#n14" name="f14" target="_blank" >[14]</a></p>

<p>For the present, facing lowered production and unemployment that has
risen above the 500,000 mark, the Conservative government consoles
itself with the improvement in the strength of sterling. The shape of
the problems looming before European capitalism are perhaps most
sharply delineated in the case of Britain, but in essence they are to
be found everywhere. In France and Germany they have been slower in
coming to the forefront for a number of special reasons, but they may
not be long delayed and would break through very quickly were there to
be a sharp contraction of world markets, such as might be precipitated
by a worsening of the position of the primary producing countries.</p>
<p>In the meantime the governments of the capitalist countries, under
the pressure of business interests, have been considering how they can
maintain their share of trade in the more intense competition now
expected. The proposals for a European Free Trade Area for the sixteen
OEEC countries (those which benefited from the Marshall Plan) and for a
customs union, known as the European Common Market, of France, Germany,
Italy and the Benelux countries, have been given a new appraisal in the
light of changing prospects. Each country is now afraid of being at a
disadvantage if others have their way; threats, menaces, bickering and
horse-trading have characterized the negotiations of recent months over
initiating the new structures. <a id="f15" href="#n15" name="f15" target="_blank" >[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">No substantial agreement has been arrived at
internationally to deal with the eventuality of a deepening of the
recession. Instead, steps have been taken to give exporters more
generous credits or to diminish the threat of outside competition by
restrictive policies. Each national capitalism seems likely to seek a
solution of its own problems regardless of whether the measures adopted
will adversely affect the prospects of the others. The race will be to
the strongest. Thus the French industrialists, with their high
production costs, seek to avoid a situation where they will have to
confront their German competitors in their own territory with the lower
level of protection which entry into the Common Market will impose.
Likewise the British cotton textile manufacturers, hard hit by
competition from Hong Kong (and to some extent from India, as well as
from China in Far Eastern markets), have been trying to secure a
&#8220;voluntary&#8221; limitation of exports into their home market from Britain&#8217;s
colony.</p>
<p>Moreover, in general, recession seems to have a loosening effect on
the common front which the capitalist powers have put up against the
Soviet bloc since the war.</p>
<p>The immediate prospects of European capitalism depend upon the
capacity of the system to extract and realize surplus value on an
expanding scale. Clothed in special forms, concealed, if not modified,
by the changes which it has undergone in recent decades, the classic
dilemmas of capitalism still impose themselves. The most pressing
question is whether markets can be expanded to enable the capacity
built up during the boom to be profitably employed and to enable the
producers goods industries &#8211; most threatened or affected by falling
output &#8211; to resume their advance. <a id="f16" href="#n16" name="f16" target="_blank" >[16]</a>
Even the adherents of the system are mostly convinced that this can
only be done by some measure of state intervention amounting, in
effect, to the provision of markets in which surplus value can be
realized and which would not otherwise have come into being. <a
id="f17" href="#n17" name="f17" target="_blank" >[17]</a></p>

<p>In Britain there has already been some decline in arms spending as a
proportion of national income, and Prime Minister Macmillan has offered
this as one of the reasons for the growth in unemployment. On the other
hand the continued rise in industrial production in France through 1957
was accounted for in part by &#8220;a steep rise in public expenditure,
consisting primarily of higher military outlays connected with the
Algerian conflict.&#8221; <a id="f18" href="#n18" name="f18" target="_blank" >[18]</a></p>
<p>Although some German sources claim that the slight recession
experienced in some sectors earlier in the year has been overcome,
there is little doubt that performance will be less brilliant in 1958
than for many years. <a id="f19" href="#n19" name="f19" target="_blank" >[19]</a> In
the first half of the year the rise in exports came to an end; they
were expected to fall in the second half. The effects of this
slackening has so far been counteracted by continued construction and
investment, but the United Nations <strong>Economic Bulletin for Europe</strong>
doubts whether this &#8220;will suffice to secure an accelerated increase in
total output in the rest of the year given the tendencies towards
stagnation or decline of private consumption and exports.&#8221; <a id="f20"
href="#n20" name="f20" target="_blank" >[20]</a> The prospects of West Germany depend
to a large extent upon the future behavior of world trade and whether
incentives will be found for a continued high level of investment. Its
comparative immunity from the effects of the American recession does
not signify that it. will be able to continue on an upward course.</p>

<p class="fst">Now and in the near future the Keynesian claims that
appropriate fiscal measures and government spending can avert
depression will be put to the test. Already in Britain the rapid
increase in unemployment within the last nine months has induced the
government to step up investment in the nationalized sector, lower the
interest rate from its crisis height of 7% down to 4&frac12;% and take
measures to encourage installment buying of homes, cars and consumer
durables. There is not much doubt that these measures can give some
relief by creating, as it were, an artificial market. The volume of
consumer credit, for example, is only about one-fifth that current in
the USA. <a id="f21" href="#n21" name="f21" target="_blank" >[21]</a> With one car to
twelve people, against one to three in the USA, the automobile
manufacturers look hopefully towards a growth in the home market
demand. At present, however, cars carry a luxury tax (known as
&#8220;purchase tax&#8221;) amounting to 60% added to the factory price. Even with
10% deposit and two to three years to pay, as under the new credit
terms, few workers can expect to buy a new car. <a id="f22" href="#n22"
name="f22" target="_blank" >[22]</a> The Conservative government will no doubt
consolidate electoral support with the middle class with such measures,
but whether they will stem the drift into recession depends upon many
factors, including important ones quite beyond their control.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Not Immune</h4>
<p class="fst">Countries with high export ratios, such as those of
Western Europe, cannot expect to expand for long unless the whole world
market is doing so. A great deal depends upon whether the present
limitation of the market is a passing phase or merely the prelude to a
resumed expansion. The shift towards a more optimistic view of market
prospects which has been taking place in the past two or three months
in business circles is obviously based upon the latter view. <a
id="f23" href="#n23" name="f23" target="_blank" >[23]</a> The growth in foreign
exchange reserves &#8211; a result of falling import prices &#8211; has given the
industrial countries the means whereby to finance the larger volume of
imports needed in the early stages of a re-expansion. On the other
hand, if their exports continue to fall not only would this tend to
dissipate the reserves once more but government spending and fiscal
policy would be of doubtful efficacy against the cumulative
deceleration taking place within the economy. The main difficulty would
be of maintaining those industries and sectors hardest hit by the loss
of overseas orders, as well as by cut-backs in private investment which
would also follow. <a id="f24" href="#n24" name="f24" target="_blank" >[24]</a></p>
<p>A situation of this kind could have been expected to follow for
Europe had the American recession deepened and extended through to
1959. As has been seen, other counteracting forces, largely of a kind
which cannot be counted upon to recur, were sufficiently potent to
alleviate, rather than intensify, the tendency to recession already
apparent in Europe. Certainly the experience of the past year does
nothing to prove the immunity of Europe &#8211; or of one or more countries
on that continent &#8211; to a subsequent depression. Should it coincide with
a contraction of the world market the most exposed sections of European
capitalism would be thrown into an economic crisis which, while perhaps
not as profound as that of the early thirties, might be even more
significant in its political results.</p>

<p class="fst">That is not to say that the strengthening of the
working-class movement in the European countries necessarily depends
upon a sharp deterioration in the economic situation. The growing
uncertainty, the threat to jobs, the swings from inflation to
recession, the inability of the system to justify itself in terms of
living standards will provide increasing opportunities for developing a
new leadership on a militant socialist program. At the same time, the
crisis of confidence on the part of the advocates and beneficiaries of
the system, which came close to the surface under stress of recent
events &#8211; in Britain the fear of an American depression, in France the
crisis of the colonial system &#8211; may break through and stand fully
revealed.</p>
<p>It is not suggested that these possibilities are immediate; but they do
seem
to sum up the tendencies in European capitalism. Taking account of the
complex interplay of all the components; considering the effect of the
spread and consolidation of the colonial revolution; adding the
possible consequences of increased rivalry and pressure from the
Soviet-Chinese bloc &#8211; then the prognosis of an indefinite smooth
expansion of world capitalism seems entirely excluded.</p>

<p>A primary unknown is the time schedule. It is impossible to foresee
how long it will take for these various processes to work themselves
out and at what time conditions will be most favorable for superseding
a system which has long outlived its historic usefulness.</p>
<p>Nor should it be assumed that capitalism will break down of itself.
Without the intervention of the subjective factor, a conscious
socialist movement, capitalism will always be able to &#8220;solve&#8221; its
problems as it has done before: through crises, fascism and war.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n1" href="#f1" name="n1" target="_blank" >1.</a> An article under
that title in <strong>Barclays Bank Review</strong>, November 1957,
concluded by stressing the need for a resurgence of  production in the
United States because &#8220;in a world so divided ideologically, capitalism
as exemplified by the American way of life must demonstrate its ability
to prevent a severe recession. &#8220;</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n2" href="#f2" name="n2" target="_blank" >2.</a> Thus in the <strong>World
Economic Survey</strong>, 1957 it was asserted that <span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">th</span>ere is no
question of the recession taking on the dimensions of the pre-war
depression; a decline on any such catastrophic scale is inconceivable,
on social and political, as well as on economic, grounds.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n3" href="#f3" name="n3" target="_blank" >3.</a> <strong>The
Economist</strong>, May 3, 1958. A panacea long favored by some
economists: e.g., R. Harrodin <strong>International Affairs</strong>,
June 1958, was an increase in the world price of gold, a step which
would depend upon the good graces of the American government. It would
add automatically to the purchasing power of gold reserves, thus
increasing the international liquidity of other countries. It would
also boost gold-producing countries, such as South Africa and the USSR).</p>
<p class="note">Another favorite is, while praising the United States
government, &#8220;so friendly and so generous as we know them to be,&#8221; to ask
them &#8220;to remove the obstacles to the growth of international trade.&#8221;
The words are those of the British Minister Sir David Eccles at the
meeting of GATT, October 1958.</p>
<p class="note">Among other economists of similar opinion, R.R. Neild
suggested: &#8220;Since the negotiation of a return to discrimination would
take some time, the rest of the world is placing considerable faith in
the US in abstaining from action now.&#8221; <strong>London and Cambridge

This article made clear that it was considerably easier for the West
European countries to withstand the United States depression than the
primary exporting countries, whose reserves had already been running
low in 1957. It also pointed to the danger of a cumulative contraction
spreading through the international economy. Another article in the
same issue hazarded the guess that &#8220;it seems likely that economic
activity in western Europe will be easier to revive than in the United
States.&#8221;</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n8" href="#f8" name="n8" target="_blank" >8.</a> Thus Andrew
Schofield, one of the most influential of British financial
journalists, wrote in <strong>The Observer</strong>, June 29, 1958:
&#8220;Even if the American recession gets no worse, clear evidence that it
was failing to revive in the autumn could have a serious effect on
business sentiment, on consumer-buying, and perhaps most important, on
stock markets. <em>The danger is that the second phase of the American
slump and the first phase of the European slump might coincide</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n9" href="#f9" name="n9" target="_blank" >9.</a> A useful summary
of the phases in postwar capitalist development is given in chapter
four of the <strong>World Economic Survey</strong>, 1957. The ending
of the boom in Europe &#8211; though that did not lead immediately to
recession &#8211; may have had some influence on precipitating depression in
the United States, where expansion continued until about the middle of
1957. It is doubtful whether it could have been a major element.
Policies of American businesses in Europe seem to have been more
influenced by what happened in America than vice versa.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n10" href="#f10" name="n10" target="_blank" >10.</a> In the first
half of 1958, foreign car registrations in the USA amounted to nearly
160,000, accounting for 6.7% at a time when new car registrations were
the lowest for six years. The American market was the largest single
overseas market for the automobile industries of Britain, France and
Germany. Its growth in 1957-58 was an important factor in the
prosperity of the industry in those countries. (Statistics from the
London <strong>Financial Times</strong>, <em>Motor Industry Supplement</em>,
October 20, 1958).</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n11" href="#f11" name="n11" target="_blank" >11.</a> The American
angle on this is to be found in the <strong>Survey of Current Business</strong>,
September 1958, which comments: &#8220;The fact that the rise in foreign
reserves was limited to the more advanced industrial nations, while the
reserves of most of the other countries remained low with little field
for maneuver, affects our export prospects.&#8221; Likewise it pointed out
that &#8220;An increase in exports to Europe cannot be expected until the
upward movement in general business activity there is resumed.&#8221; This
was particularly so because of the supplementary nature of certain US
exports to Europe. For example, coal has still been exported to Europe
on the basis of longstanding contracts; meanwhile Europe&#8217;s unsold
stocks of coal have reached unprecedented heights.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n12" href="#f12" name="n12" target="_blank" >12.</a> The $100
million deal with Argentina allowed for the credit purchase of
oil-drilling plant, in certain lines of which the USSR enjoys an
undoubted technical advantage. A severe shortage of foreign exchange
threatens Argentina&#8217;s economy with disaster; increased production of
oil from domestic sources would ease the strain and reduce dependence
upon foreign oil companies. These later offered Argentina increased
credit. A deal with Brazil followed, comprising barter of Brazilian
surplus commodities against needed imports from the USSR.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n13" href="#f13" name="n13" target="_blank" >13.</a> <strong>The
Financial Times</strong>, October 20, 1958. This article looked to &#8220;a
renewed upsurge in demand for Europe&#8217;s exports from the raw material
producing countries overseas.&#8221; The same journal stated November 1 that
&#8220;There is general agreement among businessmen that exports will
probably tend to decline over the next few months.&#8221;</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n14" href="#f14" name="n14" target="_blank" >14.</a> It is worth
noting that while exports to the USA have continued to increase, trade
between the European countries themselves has been falling, a trend
which has affected Britain to an important extent.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n15" href="#f15" name="n15" target="_blank" >15.</a> The French
Patronat is afraid of German competition inside the Common Market;
British and other businessmen are afraid of Common Market
discrimination against their exports; the Commonwealth countries are
afraid that their interests might suffer from some bargain reached
between Britain and the &#8220;Six&#8221;; and so on. The prospect of the division
of capitalist Europe into two rival trading blocs is now being
considered as a possibility. &#8220;It is idle to speculate as to which side
would come off worst &#8220; writes the November 7 <strong>Financial Times</strong>.
&#8220;The only thing that is certain is that both would come off badly.&#8221;</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n16" href="#f16" name="n16" target="_blank" >16.</a> Thus,
despite an apparent revival in business confidence in Britain and
government measures against depression, the November 1 <strong>Financial
Times</strong>, in commenting on the problem of unemployment in regions
dominated by heavy industry, writes: &#8220;None of the expansionist measures
taken by the Government so far has been able to make an appreciable
impression cm this problem.&#8221;</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n17" href="#f17" name="n17" target="_blank" >17.</a> &#8220;What is
wanted is a general expansive force to raise output to something nearer
its potential level and give an incentive to further investment.&#8221; <strong>London

<p class="note"><a id="n18" href="#f18" name="n18" target="_blank" >18.</a> <strong>World
Economic Survey</strong>, 1957. A marked slowing of the growth in
industrial output has been apparent since the summer, and talk of
&#8220;recession&#8221; has been growing. Unemployment remains minimal, however.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n19" href="#f19" name="n19" target="_blank" >19.</a> Witness to
continuing optimism is shown by the readiness with which  the <strong>Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung</strong> (September 25) claims that Germany has
already overcome the slight recession in the internal market of which
there were signs earlier in the year. It adds, &#8220;The repercussions of
the American economic crisis, with the exception of a few sectors, were
slight. Proof has again been given that, in a large measure the West
German economy is independent of the American conjuncture.&#8221;</p>

capacity may emerge in the industry as the present plans for extending
capacity are carried out.&#8221; A. Silberston in <strong>The Structure of
British Industry</strong>, Vol.2.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n23" href="#f23" name="n23" target="_blank" >23.</a> In a
much-quoted speech made October 16, Cobbold, Governor of the Bank of
England, while anticipating boundless expansion for the future, said
that he did not see what the existing business confidence was based
upon. In the course of his speech he suggested that Britain &#8220;may still
have to feel more strongly the effects of the world-wide change in the
last year or so from a sellers&#8217; market to a buyers&#8217; market&#8221; and &#8220;may
not yet have felt the full effects of lower commodity prices on some of
our best customers&#8217; spending power. (Speech reported in the November <strong>Banker</strong>).
Loss of earnings by Sterling Area countries, such as Australia and New
Zealand, has, besides involving them in a foreign payments crisis,
threatened them with severe depression which has so far been warded off
mainly through expanding credit. In the first half of 1958 Australian
exports fell 33% and those of Pakistan by 23%.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n24" href="#f24" name="n24" target="_blank" >24.</a> As perusal
of the many articles on the possible repercussions of the American
recession shows, the Keynesians are well aware that the kind of
anti-cyclical measures they recommend depend upon two factors. The
first is international cooperation &#8211; which, despite pious talk, does
not seem likely to be realized, and would be hardly likely to succeed
without the participation of the United States. The second  is timely action. As
the British economist E.A.G. Robinson puts it in the June <strong>London
and Cambridge Economic Bulletin</strong>, &#8220;There is good reason to
think that, as recession deepens, it becomes more difficult to reverse,
and that in an anti-cyclical policy one of the most essential
ingredients is promptness of action.&#8221; That also was not forthcoming in
the United States; nor can it be said to have happened in Britain. The
Conservative government waited until October before taking its very
mild action against stagnationist tendencies which had been visible for
many months.</p>
