<p class="fst">EVEN THE BRITISH press, for which Italy is normally a land of comic opera and holidays, has been forced to turn its attention to events there in the last two weeks.</p>

<p>A nationwide wave of strikes and mass demonstrations followed the shooting of two agricultural labourers, striking for higher wages, at Avola in Sicily on Monday, December 2.</p>

<p>Is Italy on the verge of a crisis like the one which shook France in May and June?</p>

<p>The events are not isolated or sudden. In the last year Italy has had a wave of strikes and demonstrations with roots in both working-class and student discontent.</p>

<p>The national economy is prospering, with a high export growth rate and a favourable balance of trade, which builds up currency reserves and benefits speculators and financiers.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Corruption</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>But wages have been firmly held down to enable this to take place, the social services are in a state of neglect, corruption and inefficiency in government are as widespread as ever, and the still-promised educational reforms have failed to materialise.</em></p>

<p>One-day general strikes, as on November 14, have been called by the three trade union federations (Communist, Catholic and social-democrat) against the inadequacy of the social services, particularly the miserable pension schemes.</p>

<p>More significantly, strikes in particular industries and factories throughout the country have been becoming more militant, such as the northern textile workers&rsquo; strike which occupied a factory last summer, or the link-up between Pirelli tyre workers in Milan and Turin who have cut productivity to a third in support of their wage claim.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Clashed</h4>

<p class="fst">The strikers have also been becoming more violent. Avola was the second occasion in a week that the Sicilian police clashed with demonstrating workers. At Palermo on November 26 they broke up 400 metalworkers striking for higher pay.</p>

<p>The armed police (carabinieri) have also been used freely against the student movement, which has grown in size and militancy since the occupation of Turin university a year ago and the wide spread demonstrations before and during the crisis in France.</p>

<p>Increasingly disillusioned with the parliamentary politics of the Socialist and Communist parties, the students have as yet no clear Left-wing leadership. There are many Maoist and anarchist groups, and a hippy tendency of recent growth &ndash; enough for the Communist Party to dissociate itself firmly from &lsquo;student extremism&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The most important recent development is the attraction of high school pupils into the movement. Their city-wide strike in Rome on December 3 followed the surrounding of an occupied school by armed police on November 19, and only incidentally coincided with the protests over the deaths at Avola.</p>

<p>Last week&rsquo;s protests were, however, an important step forward. They united, for the first time, students and workers in demonstrations all over the country.</p>

<p>The biggest was in Rome, where 50,000 students and workers took part in the second demonstration, on Thursday and the university was occupied.</p>

<p>There were similar protests in most big cities. The unions&rsquo; tactic of calling only a few hours&rsquo; general strike outside Rome was defied by workers in Pavia.</p>

<p>In Milan and Bologna students and workers marched together, while in Genoa the police used teargas against demonstrators said to have been mainly students. The wealthy audience at a premiere at <em>La Scala</em>, the Milan opera house, was pelted with fruit and ink.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Farce</h4>

<p class="fst">Parliamentary politics have reached a high point of farce and irrelevance. The centre-left coalition of Socialists, Christian Democrats and Republicans is back in office.</p>

<p>Months of argument between the veteran right-wing Nenni (who never wanted to leave the government) and the other four factions of the Socialist Party culminated in a fist-fight at the close of the party congress in October.</p>

<p>The Christian Democrats, also split several ways, refused to carry on with a minority government. So the coalition has been re-formed and the promises begin all over again.</p>

<p>The Communist Party, which holds 27 per cent of the seats in the Chamber and 30 per cent in the Senate, cannot win power by negotiation in a country where the Vatican does not hesitate to intervene to keep it out.</p>

<p>The party is nevertheless devoted to its parliamentary perspective, and even now appears co be reluctant to use its large working-class support in any form of direct action apart from one-day or half-day strikes.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Provoked</h4>

<p class="fst">There are other discontents and frustrations in Italian society. The Church has provoked protest demonstrations not only over birth control, but also its immense wealth, the Vatican&rsquo;s refusal to pay investment tax, and its interference in national and local politics.</p>

<p>Disastrous floods have again caused death and unemployment in northern Italy this autumn &ndash; while two-thirds of the money allotted to flood prevention measures remains in the Treasury.</p>

<p>Italy is in crisis, but it is a long-term crisis. It seems unlikely that events will follow the course they took in May.</p>

<p>There is no single political focus for protest, such as de Gaulle provided in France, in fact, last week there was no actual government to protest against.</p>

<p>The Communist Party, itself divided, is unwilling to play even the role that its sister party played at the start of the general strike in France &ndash; perhaps by the very force of the French example, which struck fear into the hearts of party bureaucrats hoping for a peaceful access to power.</p>

<p>The Left is weak and disunited. Students and workers have come together in action (it is interesting to note that the &lsquo;detonator&rsquo; in this case was a workers&rsquo; and not a students&rsquo; clash with police), and this may be a valuable beginning, but where it will lead to remains to be seen.</p>
