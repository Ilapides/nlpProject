<p class="fst"><strong>The Triumph of the Middle Classes</strong><br />
C. Moraz&#233;<br />
<em>Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 70s.</em></p>

<p class="fst">This book is subtitled &#8216;a study of European values in the 19th century.&#8217; At first sight it would seem to be an interesting attempt to integrate economic, social and cultural history in a survey of European society, with its expansion into other continents, between 1780 and 1895. Unfortunately, M. Moraz&#233; does not know enough about any of these subjects. The book is facile, impressionistic and opinionated, and teems with factual errors. One cannot even say the translation is competent &#8211; it consistently has &#8216;Jacobite&#8217; for Jacobin.</p>

<p>Some of M. Moraz&#233;&#8217;s opinions are as follows: the French Revolution was entirely due to the failure of the monarchy to provide adequate credit facilities &#8211; and the Third Estate was purely and simply wasting its time in discussing other legal and social reforms; the triumph of the 19th century was the rediscovery of &#8216;the Greek art of proof by reason,&#8217; otherwise defined as &#8216;science;&#8217; and 1848 saw &#8216;the definitive failure of socialism.&#8217; Meanwhile, the grand sweep of European society turns out to be a catalogue of the &#8216;We cannot leave the south without a glance at Sicily&#8217; type.</p>

<p>This book has been taken seriously by at least one eminent English historian in the pages of a quality Sunday. It does not merit even that distinction.</p>
