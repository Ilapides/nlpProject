<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;DURING the lifetime of great revolutionaries the
oppressing classes constantly hounded them, received their theories
with savage malice, the most furious hatred and the most unscrupulous
campaigns of lies and slander. After their death attempts are made to
convert them into harmless icons, to canonise them, to hallow their
names ... while at the same time robbing the revolutionary theory of
its substance, blunting its revolutionary edge and vulgarising it ...
The bourgeoisie and the opportunists within the labour movement
concur in this doctoring ... They omit, obscure or distort the
revolutionary side the theory, its revolutionary soul. They push to
the foreground and extol what is or seems acceptable to the
bourgeoisie.&rsquo; V.I. Lenin, <B>The State and Revolution</B></p>

<p class="fst">ANTONIO Gramsci died forty years ago, on April 27 1937. His death
was brought on by years of ill-treatment in Mussolini&rsquo;s gaols.
Yet in some ways, he has suffered more misfortune since his death
from the distortion of his ideas by those who have nothing in common
with his revolutionary principles.</P>
<P>Gramsci was a professional revolutionary from 1916 until his
death. Throughout this period he was insistent on the need for a
revolutionary transformation of society through the overthrow of the
capitalist state.</P>
<P>It was this that put him as a journalist in various socialist
papers in the front rank of those demanding revolutionary action from
the Italian Socialist Party in the fight against capitalism and war
in the years 1916-1918. It was this that led him to the centre of the
Turin factory councils&rsquo; movement in 1919 and 1920. It was this
that led him to take part in the split from the reformist Socialist
Party in 1921 to set up a genuinely revolutionary Communist Party. It
was this that led him to take charge of that party in 1924-6. It was
this, finally, that led him into Mussolini&rsquo;s prisons, where he
tried in note form &ndash; the famous <B>Prison Notebooks</B> &ndash;
to develop his own ideas about Italian society, the strategy and
tactics of the struggle for state power, the building of the
revolutionary party, the revolutionary press. He hoped that these
notes would provide some help to others who had the same
revolutionary goal as himself. Yet his writings have been seized upon
by those who want to turn Marxism into an academic and
non-revolutionary area of study. This has been made possible by the
systematic distortion of Gramsci&rsquo;s ideas by the Italian
Communist Party (PCI).<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The First Period of Distortion</h4>

<p class="fst">THE first period of this distortion began as soon as Gramsci died.
The Stalinist leader of the PCI Palmiro Togliatti, had the <B>Prison
Notebooks</B> in his hands within weeks. He left them unpublished for
ten years.</P>
<P>When the <B>Notebooks</B> finally began to appear in 1947, it was
in a truncated, censored form. Salvatore Sechi has shown what forms
the censorship of Gramsci&rsquo;s letters from prison took:</P><blockquote>
<OL>
	<li>To remove references to various Marxists &ndash; Bordiga,
	Trotsky and even Rosa Luxemburg &ndash; who were being portrayed as
	&lsquo;fascists&rsquo; by Togliatti at the time;</li>
	<li>To conceal the fact that Gramsci had broken with the CP&rsquo;s
	political line in 1931;</li>
	<li>To portray Gramsci&rsquo;s private life as based on an
	idealised marriage, &lsquo;a useful myth for making people believe,
	on the basis of a concrete example, in Communist loyalism with
	respect to the unity of the nuclear family, an instrument of the
	collaboration with the Catholics that the Communist Party followed
	in the post-war period&rsquo;;</li>
	<li>To suppress the fact that Gramsci had tried repeatedly to get
	hold of books that would give him access to Trotsky&rsquo;s thought
	after his expulsion from Russia in 1929. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></li>
</ol></blockquote>

<p class="fst">The aim of such distortions was to present Gramsci as the loyal
Stalinist <I>par excellence</I>. As such Gramsci could provide an
extremely useful weapon for an ideology that inspired virtually no
social thinkers of note itself &ndash; a weapon that could be used to
impress other Italian intellectuals with the rich theoretical
heritage of the PCI and to conceal the intellectual poverty of the
Kremlin and its followers, a weapon also to use against the left, to
show that the PCI which governed jointly with the Christian Democrats
after 1945, was the same party that split with even the extreme left
reformist Maximalists of the Socialist Party in 1921.</P>
<P>The censorship and distortion of his thought was necessary because
Gramsci in reality did not fit the Stalinist myth. His last letter
before entering prison had been a protest to Togliatti about the
bureaucratic treatment given to the Left Opposition inside Russia by
Stalin. Togliatti tore the letter up. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></P>
<P>In 1931 Gramsci&rsquo;s brother visited him in prison. Gramsci
told him that he rejected completely the Stalinist &lsquo;third
period&rsquo; policy which Togliatti was implementing. (Togliatti had
expelled three central committee members for opposing the line, and,
under the pseudonym Ercoli, was himself in the forefront of those
defending the line against Trotsky&rsquo;s criticisms.) His brother
was too afraid to transmit the news to Togliatti &ndash; he knew it
would mean the party abandoning his brother&rsquo;s defence.</P>
<P>Gramsci gave up his attempts to hold discussions with the other
Communist prisoners because some of them, faithfully parroting
Togliatti, denounced Gramsci as a &lsquo;social-democrat&rsquo; (the
line at the time ruled out all collaboration with reformists because
they were &lsquo;social-fascists&rsquo;). One of the last political
statements Gramsci made to his friends before his death expressed
disbelief in the evidence against Zinoviev at the Moscow trials.
Togliatti, of course, was in Moscow applauding the trials. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></P>
<P>After Gramsci&rsquo;s death Togliatti tried to present himself as
his lifelong political confidant. However, although they worked
together closely in 1919-20 and again in 1925-6, they were often far
apart over questions of revolutionary strategy and tactics in the
intervening years. And there was no contact at all between them after
Gramsci&rsquo;s imprisonment in 1926.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The &lsquo;Eurocommunist&rsquo; Period of Distortion</h4>

<p class="fst">YET in the end it was Togliatti who allowed the truth about the
previous distortions to come to light by releasing Gramsci&rsquo;s
uncensored letters and notebooks for publication. In part this was
because he was forced, as other old Communists began to spill the
beans about what Gramsci really thought. In part this was because the
passing of time made Gramsci a distant and less dangerous figure.
But, above all, the aim was to inaugurate a new period in the
distortion of Gramsci&rsquo;s ideas.</P>
<P>In the early 1960s the PCI began to draw away from Moscow. Its
leaders dreamed of being readmitted to the Italian bourgeois
government from which they had been kicked out in 1947. To achieve
this goal they tried to show the bourgeois parties that they were no
longer dependent on the Kremlin. Togliatti, one of Stalin&rsquo;s
chief collaborators in the 1930s, became one of his main critics
after 1956.</P>
<P>The switch in line led to bitter disputes with the defenders of
Stalin internationally and with Stalinist loyalists within the PCI
itself. It was a battle on two fronts &ndash; to assert the party&rsquo;s
independence from Stalin&rsquo;s heirs in the Kremlin and to prove
that a government that included the PCI would not mean a drastic
change in the state machine. Gramsci&rsquo;s previously censored
criticism of Stalin became a weapon on the first front. And a
distortion of Gramsci&rsquo;s ideas on the state was useful on the
second.</P>
<P>Gramsci, previously the patron saint of Italian Stalinism, became
the patron saint of what is now called Eurocommunism. It is in this
form, that Gramsci has been taken up by the intellectual right wing
within the Communist Party of Great Britain. He has become the
apologist for the &lsquo;historic compromise&rsquo; and the PCI&rsquo;s
&lsquo;benevolent neutrality&rsquo; towards the Andreotti
government&rsquo;s policy of wage controls and spending cuts. He is
called upon by one of the CPGB&rsquo;s would-be young intellectuals,
David Purdy, to defend the view that the breakdown of the Social
Contract would be reactionary &ndash; because of the harm to the
Labour lefts&rsquo; &lsquo;alternative economic strategy&rsquo;. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>
It is no coincidence that the new draft of the CPGB programme, <B>The
British Road to Socialism</B>, is full of phrases torn out of
Gramsci&rsquo;s <B>Prison Notebooks</B>.</P>
<P>Yet there are few Marxist thinkers whose spirit was further
removed from Eurocommunism than Gramsci&rsquo;s. His ideas were based
on notions today&rsquo;s Eurocommunists castigate as
&lsquo;insurrectionist&rsquo;, &lsquo;workerist&rsquo;,
&lsquo;spontaneist&rsquo;, and &lsquo;rank and filist&rsquo;.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>&lsquo;Insurrectionism&rsquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">FROM HIS FIRST involvement in the socialist movement Gramsci had a
bitter contempt for parliamentarians. He likened them in May 1918 to
&lsquo;a swarm of coachman flies on hunt for a bowl of blancmange in
which they get stuck and perish ingloriously&rsquo;. In words that
could be applied to Italy today he argued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The political decadence which class collaboration
brings is due to the spasmodic expansion of a bourgeois party which
is not satisfied with merely clinging to the state, but also makes
use of the party which is antagonistic to the state (i.e., the
Socialist Party &ndash; <I>CH</I>).&rsquo; <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The emphasis by Gramsci on the building of factory councils in
1919 arose from his conviction that only with new, non-parliamentary
institutions could the working class carry through its revolution:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The socialists have simply accepted the historical
reality produced by capitalist initiative. They believe in the
perpetuity and fundamental of the institutions of democratic state.
In their view the form of these democratic institutions can be
corrected, touched up here and there, but in fundamentals must be
respected.</p>

<p class="quote">&lsquo;We on the other hand remain convinced that the
socialist state cannot be embodied in the institutions of the
capitalist state ... The socialist state must be a fundamentally new
creation&rsquo;. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Gramsci&rsquo;s hostility to reformism was to increase still more
in the following years. This hostility was aimed not only at the
right-wing social democrats around Turati but also at the extreme
left social-democrats led by Serrati &ndash; the so-called
Maximalists, who mouthed a terminology that would send shivers down
Eric Heffer&rsquo;s spine. These reformists first stood back and
allowed the workers of Turin to be isolated and defeated by the
employers in a great strike of April 1920. Then they refused to give
revolutionary leadership to the vast upsurge in militancy that
produced in September 1920 the occupation of the factories throughout
northern Italy. These betrayals led Gramsci to join those who split
from the Socialist Party and founded the Communist Party of Italy in
1921.</P>
<P>Gramsci&rsquo;s hostility to left and right reformists alike was
not a sign of &lsquo;political immaturity&rsquo;, which he later
outgrew as Betty Matthews of the CPGB would have us believe. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> It
remained an emphatic note in his last major effort for the Communist
Party, before his imprisonment the <B>Theses</B> presented to the
Lyon Congress of the PCI in 1926.</P>
<P><B>The Lyons Theses</B> were the most mature of Gramsci&rsquo;s
published writings. And they were directed mainly against the
ultra-left Bordiga group, which had hitherto dominated the PCI. The
main point of disagreement was Gramsci&rsquo;s insistence on exposing
the reformist leaders by proposing to them united fronts on specific
issues. But at the same time he was adamant that</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The social-democratic party must be regarded, in
respect of its ideology and political function, as the left wing of
the bourgeoisie and not the right wing of the workers&rsquo;
movement, despite its social base, to a very large extent in the
working class.&rsquo; <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This is very close to Lenin&rsquo;s definition of the reformist
parties as &lsquo;bourgeois workers&rsquo; parties&rsquo;.</P>
<P>It is not surprising that, although they are among the best
analyses Gramsci made, the <B>Lyons Theses</B> were among the last of
his writings to become widely available (they are still not
translated into English and are barely mentioned in the main
biographies). Gramsci&rsquo;s hostility to reformism was matched by a
clear understanding of the necessity of armed insurrection. As the
<B>Lyons Theses</B> put it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The defeat of the working class (in 1919-20 &ndash;
<I>CH</I>) was due to the political, organisational, tactical and
strategic deficiency of the party of the workers. As a result of this
the proletariat did not succeed in putting itself at the head of the
insurrection of the great majority of the population.&rsquo; (my
emphasis &ndash; <I>CH</I>)</p>

<p class="fst">Hence the need for a &ndash; Communist Party, whose tasks include
&lsquo;putting to the proletariat and its allies the problem of the
insurrection against the bourgeois state&rsquo;. Moreover, &lsquo;the
Communist Party has to demonstrate the impossibility of the regime
installed by fascism being transformed in a &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; and
&ldquo;democratic&rdquo; sense without a mass struggle that must
inexorably develop into civil war.&rsquo; (my emphasis &ndash; <I>CH</I>)
So much for the &lsquo;negotiated break&rsquo; with fascism preached
by the Eurocommunist Spanish CP!</P>
<P>Of course, there is no open mention of armed insurrection in the
<B>Prison Notebooks</B>, written under the watchful eyes of fascist
jailers. But Gramsci showed in one of the few conversations he had in
prison that he had not dropped his &lsquo;immature&rsquo; insistence
on insurrection:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The violent conquest of power necessitates the
creation by the party of the working class of an organisation of the
military type, pervasively planted in every branch of the bourgeois
state apparatus, and capable of wounding and inflicting grave blows
on it at the decisive moment of struggle.&rsquo; <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a><BR>&nbsp;</p>

<H4>&lsquo;Workerism&rsquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">THE key to the fight for power for Gramsci was the working class -
&ndash; the flesh and blood workers who toiled in the Turin
factories, not the mythical, idealised workers of Stalinist and
Maoist vintage. &lsquo;Capitalist concentration&rsquo;, he wrote in
1919, &lsquo;produces a corresponding concentration of working human
masses. This is the fact that underlies all the revolutionary theses
of Marxism.&rsquo; <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></P>
<P>This stress on the central role of the working class underlay
Gramsci&rsquo;s involvement in the Turin factory councils in 1919 and
1920 and is to be found in the <B>Lyons Theses</B>. &lsquo;The
party&rsquo;, he insists repeatedly, &lsquo;must be based on the
place of production.&rsquo; It is &lsquo;the party of a single class,
the working class&rsquo;. &lsquo;All the objections to the principle
of basing the party on the place of production arise from conceptions
that are foreign to the proletariat ... They are the expression of
petty bourgeois intellectuals who don&rsquo;t see the workers as the
conscious and intelligent agents of revolution.&rsquo; The party must
have intellectuals and peasants in it, but &lsquo;it must fight
energetically as counter-revolutionary every conception that makes
the party a &ldquo;synthesis&rdquo; of heterogeneous elements&rsquo;.
The reason is simple &ndash; it is the working class that is the
decisive revolutionary force:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The practice of the movement of the factories
(1919-20 &ndash; <I>CH</I>) has shown that only an organisation fixed
in the place and system of production can permit the stabilisation of
contact between the different strata of the labouring mass.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Gramsci was far from denying the vital importance of winning the
landless agricultural labourers and peasants to the revolution. He
also saw great advantage to the working class in winning over
sections of the middle class. But this meant for him the working
class giving a lead, not hiding its socialist aims. The
revolutionaries around had to be prepared fight alongside
non-revolutionaries around slogans that stopped far short of
socialism, like the demand for a Constituent Assembly. But it had to
be clear that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;There does not exist in Italy the possibility of a
revolution that would not foe a socialist revolution. In the
capitalist countries the only class that can bring about a real and
profound social transformation is the working class.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">It was on this basis that even after he had broken with Bordiga&rsquo;s
ultraleftism, Gramsci remained bitterly opposed to the right current
in the CP led by Tasca (whose politics would put them way to the left
of today&rsquo;s Eurocommunists). Gramsci insisted that it was
&lsquo;pessimism&rsquo; and a &lsquo;deviation&rsquo; to believe that</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;the working class is not capable of overthrowing
the regime, that the better tactic would be a bourgeois-democratic
bloc ... This programme is presented by the formula of the Communist
Party as the &lsquo;left wing&rsquo; of the opposition of all forces
that conspires to bring down fascism.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The Communist Party had to put forward the some of the same
democratic slogans as the bourgeois opposition &ndash; but in order
to &lsquo;unmask&rsquo; the bourgeois parties.</P>
<P>No doubt if Gramsci were alive today his would-be admirers in the
PCI and the CPGB would insult him, as they insult us, for not
understanding the need for a &lsquo;broad democratic alliance&rsquo;
of all &lsquo;anti-monopoly&rsquo; forces.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>&lsquo;Spontaneism&rsquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">THE most developed single area of Gramsci&rsquo;s thought concerns
the fight to develop a revolutionary working-class consciousness.</P>
<P>He begins from the insistence that the working class cannot be
trained mechanically for the struggle, like an army. Its discipline
depends on its consciousness. And this in turn grows in relation to
practical experience of struggle.</P>
<P>Gramsci&rsquo;s ideas on this issue grew out of a polemic against
the three other main currents on the left in Italy in the first year
after World War One.</P>
<P>The largest, led by Serrati, saw the Socialist Party as the
embodiment of class consciousness. The dictatorship of the
proletariat would be the &lsquo;dictatorship of the Socialist Party&rsquo;,
as he put it. For him class consciousness was identified with the
slow, methodical task of building up the party. The second current,
the ultra-left revolutionaries around Bordiga, did not believe that
Serrati&rsquo;s party would ever dare to take power. But they also
saw consciousness as embodied in a party, the Communist Party,
conceived as a small elite group of highly trained and disciplined
cadres. Only after it had taken power for the class would Soviets be
formed. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> The third current, the right wing of the CP led by Tasca,
stressed teaching the workers on the one hand, agreements with the
&lsquo;left&rsquo; trade union leaders on the other. All three
groups, despite their other differences, shared the notion that class
consciousness was thrown down by the party leaders to the workers,
like crumbs to sparrows.</P>
<P>For Gramsci, by contrast, the character and the lead given to the
spontaneously developing struggles and institutions of workers
determined the growth of their consciousness. For him, as for Lenin
and Trotsky, the Soviet was not an abstraction to be set up by the
party at the right moment, but something born as an organ of workers&rsquo;
struggle in the factory, perhaps initially around an apparently
insignificant issue &ndash; the semi-insurrectionary occupation of
the factories in September 1920 was sparked off by the breakdown of
union-management negotiations over the engineer&not;ing national wage
agreement. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> The Soviet had to develop out of an organisation that
bound workers together, regardless of their craft, regardless of
their union, regardless of whether they were even in unions, around
the point of production, an organisation that united their struggles
with those other workers linked to them in the productive process, an
organisation that could express their growing awareness of their
unity, strength and ability to control production. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></P>
<P>The workers&rsquo; councils in Turin did not emerge out of thin
air. They began life as &lsquo;internal commissions&rsquo; in the
factories with similar functions in many ways to those of shop
stewards&rsquo; committees in Britain. Gramsci saw the role of
himself and his comrades on <B>L&rsquo;Ordine Nuovo</B>, the paper
they produced in Milan as being to foster this spontaneous
development, to generalise the internal commissions, to broaden their
base, to encourage them to take over more and more powers from
management, and to link up. As Gramsci wrote: 
</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The problem of the development of the internal
commissions became the central problem, the idea of <B>L&rsquo;Ordine
Nuovo</B>. It came to be seen as the fundamental problem of the
workers&rsquo; revolution: it was the problem of proletarian
&ldquo;liberty&rdquo;. For ourselves and our followers, <B>L&rsquo;Ordine
Nuovo</B> became the &ldquo;journal of the Factory Councils&rdquo;.
The workers loved <B>L&rsquo;Ordine Nuovo</B> and why did they love
it? Because in its articles they discovered part, the best part, of
themselves. Because they felt its articles were pervaded by the same
spirit of inner searching that they experienced: &ldquo;How can we
become free? How can we become ourselves?&rdquo; Because its articles
were not cold, intellectual structures, but sprang from our
discussions with the best workers: they elaborated the actual
sentiments, goals and passions of the Turin working class, that we
ourselves had provoked and tested. Because its articles were virtual
a &ldquo;taking note&rdquo; of actual events, seen as moments in a
process of inner liberation and self-expression on the part of the
working class. That is why the workers loved <B>L&rsquo;Ordine Nuovo</B>
and how its idea came to be &ldquo;formed&rdquo;.&rsquo; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When he wrote these lines in 1920 Gramsci was still a member of
the Socialist Party. It was only later in the same year, after the
defeat of the occupations, that he saw the need to break with left
reformism and to form a homogeneous revolutionary party. His writings
on factory councils therefore lack any explicit discussion of the
notion of how a revolutionary party is to work in them. But these
writings do emphasise how individual revolutionaries, and the
revolutionary paper, should operate to seize on the embryonic
elements of communist organisation and consciousness as they emerge
spontaneously, to generalise and co-ordinate them, to make workers
aware of them.</P>
<P>Gramsci returned to the same questions in 1923, when he criticised
his own willingness for three years to bury his views beneath
Bordiga&rsquo;s dogmatism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;We have not thought of the party as the result of
a dialectical process in which the spontaneous movement of the
revolutionary masses and the organisational and directive will of the
centre converge, but only as something floating in the air, which
develops in and for itself, and which the masses will reach when
their situation is favourable and the revolutionary wave has reached
its height.&rsquo; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Building the revolutionary party is not a matter of inculcating
ideas into the masses through abstract propaganda. Nor is it a matter
of waiting until the masses act, stirred on by the effects of
economic crisis. It is a question of relating to every spontaneous,
partial struggle and attempting to generalise from this. Gramsci took
up exactly the same theme again expressed in the more abstract
terminology of the <B>Prison Notebooks</B>.</P>
<P>He writes that the job of a party has to be to draw out the
elements of &lsquo;theory&rsquo; implicit in the collective struggles
of a class, and to counterpose this &lsquo;theory&rsquo; with all the
other backward, preexisting &lsquo;theories&rsquo; in the workers&rsquo;
heads. To &lsquo;construct a determined practice a theory that,
coinciding with and being identified with the decisive elements of
the same practice, accelerates the historical process in act, by
making the practice more homogenous, coherent and efficacious ...&rsquo;
<a href="#n15a" name="f15a">[15a]</a></P>
<P>This is a far cry from the reformist vision of Eurocommunism &ndash;
the struggle for socialism as a slow, purely ideological process of
education that leads workers to vote in ever greater numbers for the
correct combination of MPs and trade union officials.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>&lsquo;Rank and Filism&rsquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">GRAMSCI had nothing but contempt for reformist politicians who
sought to restrict the development of the class struggle to narrow
preconceived channels, &lsquo;to obstruct its clear course,
arbitrarily, by pre-established syntheses&rsquo; (e.g., the historic
compromise &ndash; <I>CH</I>). <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> In 1919 he began to analyse the
source of this obstruction, locating it in the Socialist Party
parliamentarians and the trade union bureaucracy. He stressed the
alienation many workers felt from their own unions and went onto
analyse the origins of this phenomenon in the fact that trade unions
operate to gain reforms within capitalism, and are staffed and
structured accordingly.</P>
<P>The unions, Gramsci explained,</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;are all types of proletarian organisations
specific to the period of history dominated by capital ... In this
period, when individuals are valued only to the extent that they own
commodities and trade their property, the workers too have become
traders too in the only property they possess, their labour-power ...
They have created these enormous apparatuses for concentrating living
labour, and have set prices and hours and disciplined the market The
trade union has an essentially competitive, not communist character.
It cannot be the instrument for a radical renovation of society.&rsquo;
<a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p class="quote">&lsquo;Thus a veritable caste of trade union officials
and journalists came into existence, with a group psychology of their
own completely at odds with that of the workers.&rsquo; <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This analysis and the experience of the Turin factory councils led
Gramsci progressively to come to see the trade union bureaucracy as
an active saboteur of the class struggle: &lsquo;The trade union
official sees industrial legality as a permanent state of affairs.
Too often he defends the same perspective as the proprietor.&rsquo;
<a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> After the betrayal of 1920 Gramsci became fully aware of the
counter-revolutionary role of the trade union leadership:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The Turin and Piedmont general strike clashed head
on with the sabotage and resistance of the trade union organisations
... It highlighted the urgent need to combat the whole bureaucratic
mechanism of the trade union organs, which form the most solid
bulwark for the opportunist activities of the parliamentarists and
reformists who aim to stifle every revolutionary initiative on the
part of the working masses.&rsquo; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">He could write in the <B>Lyons Theses</B> that &lsquo;the group
that leads the Confederation of Labour must be considered as a
vehicle for the dissolving influence of another class upon the
working class&rsquo;.</P>
<P>Nor did the Gramsci of the <B>Prison Notebooks</B> abandon these
&lsquo;immature&rsquo;, &lsquo;workerist&rsquo; and &lsquo;rank and
filist&rsquo; positions. He wrote in 1930:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;Neglecting, or worse still despising, so-called
&lsquo;spon&not;taneous movements, i.e., failing to give them a
conscious leadership or to raise them to a higher plane by inserting
them into politics, may often have extremely serious consequences.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">He related the defeat of 1920, which paved the way for Mussolini&rsquo;s
coup in 1922, to the failure of Serrati, Bordiga and Tasca alike to
offer such leadership to the spontaneous movements of workers and
peasants:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;It is almost always the case that a &lsquo;spontaneous&rsquo;
movement of the subaltern classes (i.e., working people &ndash; <I>CH</I>)
is accompanied by a reactionary movement of the right wing of the
ruling class for concomitant reasons. An economic crisis, for
instance, engenders on the one hand discontent among the subaltern
classes and spontaneous movements, and on the other conspiracies
among the reactionary groups, who take advantage of the objective
weakening of the government in order to attempt coups d&rsquo;etat.
Among the effective causes of the coups must be included the failure
of the responsible groups (i.e., the Socialist Party &ndash; <I>CH</I>)
to give any conscious leadership to the spontaneous revolts or to
make them into a positive political factor.&rsquo; (my emphasis &ndash;
<I>CH</I>) <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Of course, Gramsci was not a &lsquo;workerist&rsquo;, a
&lsquo;spontaneist&rsquo;, a &lsquo;rank and filist&rsquo; in the
real sense of the words, in the sense of devaluing the
interventionist role of Marxists in the class struggle. Quite the
contrary. His own activity in 1919-20 and 1924-26 was a shining
(although not, of course, perfect) example of such intervention.</p>
