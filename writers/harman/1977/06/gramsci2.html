</td></tr></table><BR><hr CLASS="section" SIZE="1" NOSHADE>

<p class="fst">Eurocommunist distortions of Gramsci&rsquo;s thought base
themselves on the following argument:</P>
<p class="fst">Gramsci is said to show that Western societies are quite different
from Tsarist Russia. The power of the ruling class in the West rests
mainly, not on physical control through the military-police
apparatus, but on its ideological domination exercised through a
network of voluntary institutions that pervade everyday life (&lsquo;civil
society&rsquo;) &ndash; the political parties, the trade unions, the
churches, the mass media. The repressive state apparatus is only one
among many defences of capitalist society.</P>
<P>It follows that the key struggle for revolutionaries is not a
direct assault on state power, but the struggle for ideological
dominance, for what Gramsci calls &lsquo;hegemony&rsquo;. Hegemony is
won by a long drawn out process that takes many years and demands
infinite patience and sacrifice on the part of the working class. In
particular, the working class can only become &lsquo;counter-hegemonic&rsquo;
by winning over the main sections of the intellectuals and the
classes they represent, because of the crucial role they play in
manning the apparatus of ideological domination. The working class
has to be prepared to sacrifice its own short-term economic interests
in order to do this. And until it has achieved this task, has become
the &lsquo;hegemonic&rsquo; class, attempts to seize state power can
only end in defeat. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></P>
<P>Justification for this position is claimed to rest on the
distinction Gramsci makes in the Prison Notebooks between two types
of war:</P><blockquote>
<OL>
	<li>War of manoeuvre, which involves rapid movement by the rival
	armies, with thrusts forwards and backwards as each tries to
	outflank the other and its cities;</li>
	<li>War of position, a long drawn out struggle in which the two
	armies are deadlocked in battle, each hardly able to move forward,
	like the trench warfare of 1914-18.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;Military experts maintain that in wars among the
more industrially and socially advanced states the war of manoeuvre
must be considered as reduced to more of a tactical than a strategic
function ...</p>

<p class="quote">&lsquo;The same reduction must take place in the art and
science of politics, at least in the case of the most advanced
states, where &lsquo;civil society&rsquo; has become a very complex
structure and one which is resistant to the catastrophic &lsquo;incursions&rsquo;
of the immediate economic elements (crises, depressions, etc.)&rsquo;.
<a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The last successful example of war of manoeuvre applied i.e.
frontal assault on the state &ndash; was the October revolution in
1917:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;It seems to me that Ilitch (i.e., Lenin &ndash;
<I>CH</I>) understood that change was necessary from the war of
manoeuvre applied victoriously in the East in 1917, to a war of
position that was the only form possible in the West.&rsquo; <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The basis for this switch in strategy lay in the different social
structures of Tsarist Russia and Western Europe:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;In Russia the State was everything, civil society
was primordial and gelatinous; in the West ... when the State
trembled a sturdy structure of civil society was at once revealed.
The State was only an outer ditch, behind which there stood a
powerful system of fortresses and earthworks&rsquo;. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The formula of permanent revolution &ldquo;belongs to a historical
period in which the great mass political parties and the great
economic trade unions did not yet exist, and society was still, so to
speak, in a state of fluidity from many points of view ... In the
period after 1870 ... the internal and international organisational
relations of the State became more complex and massive, and the Forty
Eightist formula of the &lsquo;Permanent Revolution&rsquo; (Marx
adopted this slogan after the 1848 revolution &ndash; <I>CH</I>) is
expanded and transcended in political science by the formula of
&lsquo;civil hegemony&rsquo;.&rdquo; <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></P>
<P>Gramsci&rsquo;s formulations should not be accepted uncritically,
as I shall show below. But first it must be made clear that they do
not permit the Eurocommunists&rsquo; conclusions.</P>
<P>In the first place, war of position is a <I>war</I>. It is not
<I>class collaboration</I> of the sort pursued by the PCI today.
Gramsci&rsquo;s contempt for the reformists who preached class
collaboration did not alter one whit in prison. He compared their
passivity in the face of the fascists to &lsquo;the beaver (who),
pursued by trappers who want his testicles from which medicinal drugs
can be extracted, to save his life tears off his own testicles&rsquo;
<a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> (so much for that old friend of the CPGB &ndash; Jack Jones).</P>
<P>In the second place, it is not a startling revelation to claim
that revolutionary politics is devoted for much of its time to &lsquo;war
of position&rsquo;. After all, Lenin and Trotsky had argued at the
Third Congress of the Communist International in 1921 <I>on the basis
of the Russian Bolsheviks&rsquo; experience</I> for united fronts
with reformist parties in order to win a majority of the working
class to communism. They fought bitterly against the ultra-left
&lsquo;theory of the offensive&rsquo; then much in vogue particularly
in the German Communist Party &ndash; the view that the Communist
Parties could simply storm forward to the seizure of power without
the support of the majority of the class through repeated
insurrectionary adventures. Gramsci acknowledged Trotsky&rsquo;s role
in turning the Comintern toward the tactic of united fronts. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> And
he explicitly identifies the &lsquo;war of position&rsquo; with &lsquo;the
formula of the United Front.&rsquo; <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></P>
<P>In the <B>Lyons Theses</B> Gramsci sought to apply the united
front tactic to Italy. The adoption of this tactic (which he had
previously followed Bordiga in opposing) did not represent any
slackening of Gramsci&rsquo;s hostility towards the reformists. He
wrote: &lsquo;The tactic of the united front is a political tactic
designed to smash self-styled revolutionary and proletarian parties
and groups with a mass base.&rsquo; The tactic is adopted towards
&lsquo;intermediate formations that the Communist Party sees as an
obstacle to the revolutionary preparation of the working class&rsquo;.</P>
<P>In the third place, the battle for hegemony is not simply as
ideological battle. It is true that Gramsci continually rejects the
belief that the deterioration of workers&rsquo; economic conditions
leads automatically to revolutionary consciousness. He stresses this
point because in the <B>Prison Notebooks</B> he is concerned to
refute the then current Stalinist &lsquo;third period&rsquo; thesis
that the world crisis on its own would lead to world revolution. He
bends the stick in order to deal with this mechanistic deviation from
Marxism.</P>
<P>But Gramsci never denies the determining role of the economy in
political life. So while &lsquo;it may be ruled out that immediate
economic crises of themselves produce fundamental historic events&rsquo;,
&lsquo;they can simply create a terrain more favourable to the
dissemination of certain modes of thought, and certain ways of posing
and resolving questions involving the entire subsequent development
of national life.&rsquo; <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> He formulated the relation between the
economy and ideology in these terms: &lsquo;mass ideological factors
always lag behind mass economic phenomena&rsquo; and so &lsquo;at
certain moments, the automatic thrust due to the economic factor is
slowed down, obstructed or even momentarily broken by traditional
ideological elements.&rsquo; It was precisely because of this lagging
of ideology behind the economy that the intervention of the
revolutionary party in the economic struggles of workers was
necessary to win them from the reformists.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;Hence ... there must be a conscious, planned
struggle to ensure that the exigencies of the economic position of
the masses, which may conflict with the traditional leadership&rsquo;s
policies, are un&not;derstood. An appropriate political initiative is
always necessary to liberate the economic thrust from the dead weight
of traditional policies.&rsquo; <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">And in one of the central passages of the <B>Prison Notebooks</B>
Gramsci returned to the experience of the Turin factory councils
movement of 1919-20 in order to contrast the convergence of Marxist
theory and spontaneous workers&rsquo; struggles that took place there
with both narrow, sectional, &lsquo;corporatist&rsquo;, economic
struggles and a purely intellectual and &lsquo;voluntaristic&rsquo;
approach that preached politics to workers from the outside:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The Turin movement was accused simultaneously of
being &ldquo;spontaneist&rdquo; and &ldquo;voluntarist&rdquo; ...
This contradictory accusation, if one analyses it, only testifies to
the fact that the leadership was not &ldquo;abstract&rdquo;; it
neither consisted in mechanically repeating scientific or theoretical
formulae, nor did it confuse politics, real action, with theoretical
disquisition. It applied itself to real men, formed in specific
historical relations, with specific feelings, outlooks, fragmentary
conceptions of the world, etc., which were the result of
&ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo; combinations of a given situation of
material production with the &ldquo;fortuitous&rdquo; agglomeration
within it of disparate social elements. This element of &ldquo;spontaneity&rdquo;
was not neglected and even less despised. It was <I>educated</I>,
directed, purged of extraneous determinations; the aim was to bring
it in line with modern theory (i.e. Marxism &ndash; <I>CH</I>) &ndash;
but in a living and historically effective manner. The leaders
themselves spoke of the &ldquo;spontaneity&rdquo; of the movement,
and rightly so. The assertion was a stimulus, a tonic, an element of
unification in depth; above all, it denied that the movement was
arbitrary, a cooked-up venture, and stressed its historical
necessity. It gave the masses a &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo;
consciousness of being creators of <I>historical</I> and
institutional <I>values</I>, of being founders of a State. This unity
between &ldquo;spontaneity&rdquo; and &ldquo;conscious leadership&rdquo;
of &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; is precisely the real political action of
the subaltern classes.&rsquo; <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the fourth place, the struggle to win over other oppressed
classes (or for that matter the more backward layers of the working
class) does not mean the abandonment by the proletariat of the fight
for its own interests. When Gramsci contrasted the &lsquo;corporatist&rsquo;
with the &lsquo;hegemonic&rsquo; approach <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a>, he was contrasting
those who merely defend their own interests within capitalist
society, as reformist trade unionists do, with those who project
their struggle as holding the key to the liberation of all oppressed
groups.</P>
<P>In Italy in the 1920s and 1930s the hegemonic approach implied a
break with the old reformist strategy of trying to gain concessions
for the workers of the North by acquiescing in the impoverishment of
the landlord-and-priest-ridden South. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a> Instead the working class
had, as well as fighting for improvement in its own situation, to
offer land to the peasants and the prospect of a more worthwhile
society to the intelligentsia.</P>
<P>As in the struggle for working class consciousness, the key to
winning the peasantry was to be found in the linking of political
questions to practical demands. Again and again, Gramsci criticises
the extreme radicals (the Action Party) in the struggle to unify
Italy in the nineteenth century (and by implication the reformist
socialists in the 20th century) for failing to take the only <I>action</I>
that would break the hold of reaction and Catholicism in the South &ndash;
the fight to divide the big estates among the peasants. Because it
saw the struggle for hegemony as a purely <I>intellectual</I>
struggle, the Action Party missed out. &lsquo;The failure to solve
the agrarian problem led to the near impossibility of solving the
problem of clericalism.&rsquo; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></P>
<P>The working class might have to make &lsquo;certain sacrifices of
an economic-corporative kind&rsquo; in order to gain the support of
other classes.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;But there is also no doubt that such sacrifices
and such a compromise cannot touch the essential; for though hegemony
is ethical-political, it must also be economic, must necessarily be
based on the decisive function exercised by the leading group (the
working class &ndash; <I>CH</I>) in the decisive nucleus of economic
activity.&rsquo; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There is no indication whatsoever that Gramsci had in the <B>Prison
Notebooks</B> abandoned his position in the <B>Lyons Theses</B>,
according to which the workers had to go out of their way to win over
the peasants, but this could only be done by building workers&rsquo;
committees based on the economic position of workers in the factories
and using these committees to stimulate the formation of peasants&rsquo;
committees. Interestingly, although Gramsci spoke of &lsquo;ruling
blocs&rsquo; and although he stressed the need of the working class
to win the peasantry, he did not use the then fashionable Stalinist
jargon about &lsquo;worker-peasant blocs&rsquo;. Still less did
he conceive of the middle-class intellectuals as an ally on the level
of equality with the working class. They could only be won to follow
its lead in the course of struggle. <a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a></P>
<P>In the fifth and final place, Gramsci <I>never</I> suggests in the
<B>Prison Notebooks</B> that the struggle for hegemony can by itself
solve the problem of state power. Even in a period when the &lsquo;war
of position&rsquo; plays a predominant part, Gramsci speaks of a
&lsquo;&ldquo;partial&rdquo; element of movement&rsquo; <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a>, of &lsquo;the
war of manouevre&rsquo; playing &lsquo;more a tactical than a
strategic function&rsquo;. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></P>
<P>To put it another way: most of the time revolutionaries are
involved in ideological struggle, using the tactics of the united
front in partial struggles to win leadership from the reformists.
Nonetheless, there are periodic moments of violent confrontation,
when one side or other tries to break through the other&rsquo;s
trenches by frontal assault. Armed insurrection remained for Gramsci,
as he made clear in his prison conversations, &lsquo;the decisive
moment of struggle&rsquo;.</P>
<P>The stress on &lsquo;war of position&rsquo; in the <B>Prison
Notebooks</B> must be set in its historical context. It is a metaphor
designed to hammer home a concrete political point &ndash; the
revolutionary will of a few thousand revolutionaries at a time of
crisis does not create the preconditions for a successful
insurrection. These preconditions have to be prepared by a long
process of political intervention and ideological struggle. To think
otherwise, as did Togliatti and other &lsquo;third period&rsquo;
Stalinists in the early 1930s, was sheer madness. In the
circumstances, Gramsci was less concerned to argue for the necessity
of armed insurrection &ndash; after all, the Stalinists were at the
time hell-bent on organising armed uprisings however hopeless &ndash;
but to stress, as Lenin had in July 1917, and again in the case of
Germany in 1921, that an insurrection can only succeed with the
active support of the majority of the working class.</P>
<P>It is therefore misleading to apply the metaphor as if it were of
universal validity independent of its historic context. After all,
even in purely military terms, static &lsquo;war of position&rsquo;
is not always appropriate &ndash; as the French general staff
discovered to its cost when the German tanks bypassed the Maginot
line in 1940.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Ambiguities in Gramsci&rsquo;s Formulations</h4>

<p class="fst">ANY metaphor as liable to misinterpretation as Gramsci&rsquo;s
&lsquo;war of position&rsquo;, &lsquo;war of manoeuvre&rsquo;
distinction must itself be open to criticism. Perry Anderson has
pointed out in an interesting article that Gramsci&rsquo;s metaphors
involve a number of ambiguities and contradictions, a conceptual
&lsquo;slippage&rsquo; capable of being used by reformists to distort
the revolutionary essence of Gramsci&rsquo;s work. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></P>
<P>Certainly, Gramsci&rsquo;s contrast between &lsquo;war of
manouevre&rsquo; and &lsquo;war of position&rsquo; is rather vague.
At one point the transition from the political &lsquo;war of
position&rsquo; takes place after 1871; yet at another it is shifted
to the post-stabilisation of the world capitalist economy in the
early 1920s. This confusion over timing is important because it
leaves unsettled whether &lsquo;war of position&rsquo; is an eternal
strategy or one appropriate only in certain periods. Some of
Gramsci&rsquo;s formulations suggest the former interpretation. But
it must be ruled out by his repeated insistence on the interaction
between the revolutionary party and the &lsquo;spontaneous struggles&rsquo;
of the class, and belief in the necessity of armed insurrection.</P>
<P>A second confusion lies in the contrast between Russia and the
West. The contrast involves a misrepresentation of the history of the
Russian revolutionary movement. In fact, the first attempt at a &lsquo;war
of manouevre&rsquo; &ndash; the armed attacks on the Tsarist regime
by the Decembrists in the 1820s and the Populists who succeeded in
assassinating the Tsar in 1881 &ndash; failed. Subsequent generations
of revolutionaries <I>had to adopt a different strategy</I>. The
overthrow of the autocracy required a prolonged &lsquo;war of
position&rsquo; &ndash; ten years of Marxist discussion circles and
another ten years of &lsquo;economistic&rsquo; agitation before the
mass party could emerge in 1905, and then 12 years of recuperation of
forces. This &lsquo;war of position&rsquo; was necessary to prepare
the ground for the &lsquo;war of manouevre&rsquo; in 1905-6 and 1917.</P>
<P>To extend Gramsci&rsquo;s metaphor: the military war of position
becomes obsolete and dangerous with the discovery of a new weapon
that can break through the other side&rsquo;s defences, as the tank
could at the end of World War I (although it was not used to real
advantage) and at the beginning of World War II. The political
equivalent of the tank is the sudden, spontaneous revolutionary
&lsquo;thrust from below&rsquo; (in Gramsci&rsquo;s words) of the
masses, that took even Lenin by surprise in February 1917.
Revolutionaries cannot adapt to these sudden changes without a <I>rapid
switch</I> from a defensive posture to one that relates to the new
&lsquo;war of manouevre&rsquo;, attempting to guide and influence the
forward surge. Lenin&rsquo;s greatness, as Tony Cliff has shown, lay
in his ability to grasp when the strategic switch from &lsquo;war of
position&rsquo; to &lsquo;war of manouevre&rsquo; must be made.</P>
<P>What Lenin (and Trotsky and Rosa Luxemburg) grasped was that the
long drawn out struggle for hegemony, for an organisation and
consolidation of one&rsquo;s own forces, is necessary at certain
stages in the history of the revolutionary movement. But it contains
within it a danger &ndash; the very success of organisation at one
stage in the struggle leads to conservatism when there is a shift in
the mood of the masses.</P>
<P>After all, the archetype of the party waging the &lsquo;war of
position&rsquo; in pre-World War I Europe was the German Social
Democratic Party (SPD). It built up a huge network of
&lsquo;fortifications&rsquo; within bourgeois society &ndash;
hundreds of papers, hundreds of thousands of party members, local
co-ops and clubs, a woman&rsquo;s movement, a powerful trade union
machine, even a theoretical journal capable of attracting admiration
from some sections of established intellectuals. Its attempt to
maintain these &lsquo;positions&rsquo; when the World War broke out
led to it moving from opposition to class collaboration.
(Interestingly, the very metaphor of the &lsquo;war of positions and
manoeuvre&rsquo; was employed in terms very close to Gramsci&rsquo;s
by Kautsky against attacks by Rosa Luxemburg on the SPD&rsquo;s
reformist leadership in 1912 <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a>).<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Russia, Italy and the West</h4>

<p class="fst">ITALY is taken by Gramsci as the prototype of the society in which
&lsquo;the war of position&rsquo; is necessary. Yet Italy in the
1920s and 1930s was far from being a typical advanced capitalist
society. The things Gramsci regards as characteristic of &lsquo;civil
society&rsquo; &ndash; the church, urban political and cultural
association, the plethora of bourgeois and petty bourgeois parties,
the influence of &lsquo;functional intellectuals&rsquo; like
teachers, lawyers and priests &ndash; seem today to be a <I>transient</I>
historical phenomenon, symptomatic of Italy&rsquo;s <I>backwardness</I>
in the 1920s and 1930s, the numerical preponderance of the peasantry,
the lumpenproletariat and the petty bourgeoisie. Even <I>urban</I>-based
political and cultural societies tend to decline in importance in
truly advanced capitalist societies.</P>
<P>In Britain, and the same is true of the other advanced capitalist
countries, the post-war period has been characterised by the
phenomenon of &lsquo;apathy&rsquo; &ndash; a falling away of mass
participation in political and cultural associations like the Labour
Party and the WEA, the decline in the political influence of the
Orange Lodges in Liverpool and Glasgow, a halving in the number of
active church members in ten years. The &lsquo;functional
intellectuals&rsquo; &ndash; the lawyers, teachers, priests, doctors
&ndash; no longer play a key role in local opinion formation.</P>
<P>Advanced capitalism leads to a <I>centralisation</I> of
ideological power, to the atomisation of the masses &ndash; with the
crucial exception of workplace-based union organisation &ndash; and
to a weakening of old political and cultural organisations.</P>
<P>On the one hand the intensification of the labour process has
played a role &ndash; shift work makes the organisation of local
political or cultural associations difficult; on the other hand, the
commer&not;cialisation of social life, the advent of radio and
television, and the concentration of control over the mass media has
weakened the attractiveness of other &lsquo;leisure&rsquo;
activities. The number of effective structures of &lsquo;civil
society&rsquo; between the individual and the state has fallen. More
and more the means of mass communication provide a direct
intermediary. At the same time, the significance of workplace-based
trade union organisation has grown dramatically; to become the one
institution of&rsquo; civil society&rsquo; not subverted by the
atomisation.</P>
<P>In the circumstances, the &lsquo;defensive network of trenches&rsquo;
available to the ruling class in a time of crisis becomes very weak
indeed once workers really move into action. Indeed, the bourgeoisie
becomes critically dependent upon the trade union bureaucracy, and to
a lesser extent upon the reformist political organisations, to hold
back the working class. But over time this leads to an erosion of
faith in the reformist leaders and to spontaneous eruptions by
workers that even they cannot control. Under such circumstances a
real &lsquo;war of manouevre&rsquo; can develop, in which workers,
despite their lack of revolutionary consciousness, find themselves in
direct conflict with the capitalist state.</P>
<P>As Tony Cliff pointed out in a very important article in 1968,
advanced capitalism creates &lsquo;privatisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;apathy&rsquo;.
But &lsquo;the concept of apathy is not a static one. When the path
of individual reform is closed apathy can transform itself into its
opposite, direct, mass action. Workers who have lost their loyalty to
the traditional organisations are forced into extreme, explosive
struggles on their own.&rsquo; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></P>
<P>Gramsci&rsquo;s metaphors were used 45 years ago to deal with
concrete problems of strategy. His epigones attempt to deploy them in
a crude way to block off discussion today, without noticing that in
the years since society has changed in certain crucial ways. That is
a piece of dogmatism no different to the treatment Marx, Lenin or
Trotsky have suffered on so many occasions.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Gramsci&rsquo;s Weaknesses</h4>

<p class="fst">THE conditions in which Gramsci lived and wrote imposed certain
built-in limitations to his thought. In the case of the <B>Prison
Notebooks</B> these limitations provide the basis for the distortions
to which his ideas have been subjected.</P>
<P>The first and most obvious limitation was that the fascist state
was looking over Gramsci&rsquo;s shoulder, reading every word he
wrote. To avoid the prison censorship he had to be vague when
referring to some of the most pointed concepts of Marxism. He had to
use an ambiguous Aesopian language that concealed his real thoughts,
not only from his gaolers, but also from his Marxist readers and
sometimes, one suspects, from himself.</P>
<P>To take a crucial point, Gramsci often uses the bourgeois struggle
for power against feudalism as a metaphor for the workers&rsquo;
struggle for power against capitalism. But the comparison is
dangerously misleading. Because capitalist relations of production
have as their starting point commodity production, which can develop
within feudal society, the bourgeoisie can use their growing economic
dominance to build up their ideological position within the framework
of feudalism before seizing power. However, the working class can
become economically dominant only through taking collective control
of the means of production, which requires the armed seizure of
political power. It is only then that they will gain control of the
printing presses, universities, etc, where the capitalists could buy
these up long before becoming politically dominant. Gramsci
necessarily had to seem ambiguous on this point. But today the
ambiguity provides an excuse for would-be intellectuals who want to
pretend they are fighting the class struggle through &lsquo;a
theoretical practice&rsquo;, &lsquo;a struggle for intellectual
hegemony&rsquo;, when in fact they are only advancing their own
academic careers.</P>
<P>Moreover, Gramsci could not write openly about armed insurrection.
This gap in the <B>Prison Notebooks</B> has enabled his epigones to
ignore the harsh reality of the state power that held Gramsci in its
grip.</P>
<P>But there were other, non-physical limitations on Gramsci. He went
to gaol just as Stalin was tightening his hold on Russia. His failure
to come to terms with this process marked his thought more deeply
than may at first be apparent.</P>
<P>Gramsci declared his support for the Stalin-Bukharin bloc formed
in 1925. He seems to have accepted as part of an international &lsquo;war
of position&rsquo; the attempt to build &lsquo;socialism in one
country&rsquo; through making concessions to the peasants. So he
identified Trotsky&rsquo;s opposition to socialism in one country
with an ultra-left rejection of the united front &ndash; even though
he knew perfectly well that Trotsky was one of the main authors of
the tactic of the united front.</P>
<P>Gramsci, as we have seen, was very aware and very critical of the
suffocating bureaucratism of Stalinism. But his acceptance of the
Bukharin-Stalin version (1925-28) of &lsquo;socialism in one country&rsquo;
prevented him analysing what had gone wrong in Russia.</P>
<P>He writes, in the <B>Prison Notebooks</B>,</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;The war of position demands enormous sacrifices by
infinite masses of people. So an unprecedented concentration of
hegemony is necessary, and hence a more &ldquo;interventionist&rdquo;
government which will take the offensive against the oppositionists
...&rsquo; <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Yet this half-apology for totalitarian trends is followed by a
warning quotation from Marx,</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;A resistance too long prolonged in a besieged camp
is demoralising in itself. It implies suffering, fatigue, loss of
rest, illness and continual pressure, not of the acute danger which
tempers, but of the chronic danger which destroys&rsquo;.</p>

<p class="fst">Gramsci seems to want to both criticise this state of affairs, and
to say that it is based upon a correct strategy. This contradiction
cannot fail to have debilitating effects on other aspects of his
theory.</P>
<P>In 1919-20 he grasped as no-one else in Western Europe the
interrelation of the struggle in the factory and the creation of the
elements of a workers state. He also came to see the dialectical
interplay between the development of workers&rsquo; democracy and its
propellant, the revolutionary party. This understanding remains in
much of the work <B>Prison Notebooks</B> &ndash; but at points it is
corroded by the tendency to see the Stalinist &lsquo;socialism in one
country&rsquo; as providing a method for waging the &lsquo;war of
positions&rsquo; to be copied elsewhere.</P>
<P>Gramsci was not unique in failing to come to terms with Stalinism.
At the time he was imprisoned and lost contact with the international
movement the full horrors of Stalinism were a thing of the future.
Revolutionaries as varied as Andreas Nin and James P. Cannon still
supported Stalin against Trotsky at that time. But in Gramsci&rsquo;s
case the failing left an element of confusion in his theory that is
seized on by those trying to justify reformist policies today.</P>
<P>There is one final more fundamental weakness in Gramsci. Although
he provides a correct <I>abstract</I> account of the relation between
economics and politics, Gramsci is alone among the great Marxists in
not integrating a <I>concrete</I> economic dimension into his
political writings. This produces arbitrariness in his writings that
does not exist in Marx, Engels, Lenin, Luxemburg or Trotsky. For
instance in 1925 he thought fascism was about to collapse. Yet in the
<B>Prison Notebooks</B>, a few years later, he wrote as if it faced a
long life. Again, he talks of the dangers of a &lsquo;corporate&rsquo;
integration of the working class into the system, without discussing
the economic conditions that could make this possible.</P>
<P>In general, there is a failure to show the real interrelation
between a particular economic situation and political and ideological
struggles of individuals it affects. In the years 1918-26 he was able
to fill this gap to some extent by relying on his direct experience
of the class struggle. So his best writings are those where, mixing
with the workers and trying to guide them, he is grappling with
central problems of current struggles.</P>
<P>But in 1926 the fascist state snatched him away from any contact
with the masses. Gramsci was only too aware of what this meant:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;Books and magazines contain generalized notions
and only sketch the course of events in the world as best they can:
they never let you have an immediate direct, animated sense of the
lives of Tom, Dick and Harry. If you are not able to understand real
individuals, you are not able to understand what is universal and
general.&rsquo; (<I>Letter to Tatiana</I>, November 1928, quoted in
Boggs p.62)</p>

<p class="fst">This was true of Gramsci, who was unable, without direct personal
experience, to grasp the concrete interrelation between the economic
situation and the political reaction to it of individuals. But it was
not true, say, of the Marx who from exile could write the <B>18th
Brumaire</B>, or the Trotsky who from confinement in Turkey could
write profoundly about daily developments in Berlin.</P>
<P>The <B>Prison Notebooks</B> suffer above all from this inability
to move from abstract concepts to concrete analyses of concrete
situations. It is this, of course, that appeals to those bureaucrats
and academics who want a reformist &lsquo;Marxism&rsquo; divorced
from the mass struggles of workers.</P>
<P>If such a project runs counter to the main thrust of Gramsci&rsquo;s
life and thought, we should not ignore the weakness in the <B>Notebooks</B>
that arises from their lack of concreteness. Whatever their insights
they do not have the greatness of the finest works of Marx, Lenin or
Trotsky.</P>
<P>The fascist prosecutor at Gramsci&rsquo;s trial demanded his
imprisonment &lsquo;to stop this brain working for 20 years&rsquo;.
The fascists did not succeed in this attempt. But, by cutting Gramsci
off from direct involvement in the class struggle, they did succeed
in preventing his Marxism from fully realising the potential
displayed in <B>L&rsquo;Ordine Nuovo</B> and the <B>Lyons Theses</B>.</p>
