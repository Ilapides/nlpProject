<p class="fst">FLINT, Mich., Mar. 31 &ndash; A large protest meeting held under the auspices of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, heard a rousing talk by Genora Dollinger, representative of the Socialist Workers Party, condemning the recent bloody assault against the Negro people in Columbia, Tennessee. Mrs. Dollinger, a well-known UAW unionist in Flint and Detroit, delivered the main address.</p>

<p>Other speakers who addressed the 150 present were Jesse Governor, president of the Local NAACP branch, Joe Brandt, Organizer of the Flint Communist Party; John Young, Flint attorney, and George Stevens, candidate for State Legislature on the Democratic ticket.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dollinger reviewed the facts behind the recent wave of anti-Negro terror sweeping the country, terming it a part of the boss offensive against the labor movement.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The powerful unity of the workers in the recent huge strike wave,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;has shown the capitalist rulers how great, how mighty is the working class united ... The bosses recognize this threat to their imperialistic interests and are beginning to build up their fascist organizations to spread their gospel of hate and poison among us.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Standing Ovation</h4>

<p class="fst">Advocating an independent labor party, she continued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The politicians of the rich in our Congress at one and the same time kill FEPC and draw up legislation to smash labor unions.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">In conclusion she stated:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The Socialist Workers Party, which I represent, will leave no stone unturned until the Columbia Tennessee victims are freed and vindicated and their murderers placed behind bars. The Socialist Workers Party will leave no stone unturned until this rotten system of discrimination, wars, poverty and misery is replaced by a system of true equality and justice and real liberty for all.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Her address was greeted by a standing ovation from all present. The audience composed primarily of GM workers and their wives, contributed $165 for the defense of the Columbia Tennessee victims.</p>
