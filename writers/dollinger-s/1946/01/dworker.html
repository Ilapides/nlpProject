<p class="fst">FLINT, Mich., Jan. 9 &ndash; A red-baiting &ldquo;anti-Trotskyite&rdquo;
attack on the Flint auto union militants in the Stalinist <B>Daily
Worker</B>, January 5, has aroused great indignation among the
General Motors strikers here and boomeranged against the Stalinist
slanderers.</p>

<p>Tex Owens, UAW Chevrolet Local president here, who is &ldquo;quoted&rdquo;
in the <B>Daily Worker</B> as one source of its &ldquo;information&rdquo;
against the &ldquo;Trotskyites,&rdquo; has repudiated statements
attributed to him in the Stalinist article, <I>Why Chevrolet Local
Fights The Trotskyites</I>. Owens gave the lie to the article in the
presence of this reporter.</p>

<p>After seven weeks of the GM strike, this article provided the
occasion for the first public appearance of the Communist (Stalinist)
Party in Flint. This issue of the <B>Daily Worker</B> was distributed
to CIO auto workers attending a mass meeting addressed by top UAW
officers on the progress of negotiations with the corporation.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the Stalinists hoped that this article, written
by William Allan, a professional hack writer, would lay the
groundwork for a campaign against the Flint progressives, the
Trotskyists and <B>The Militant</B>, which has gained great
popularity among the GM strikers for its accurate and sympathetic
reporting of their strike.</p>

<p>Allan&rsquo;s article is based on statements allegedly made by Tom
Kelly, recording secretary of Chevrolet Local, and confirmed by Tex
Owens. Interviewed by Allan, Kelly is reported as saying, &ldquo;He
would be glad to tell us about the Trotskyites.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Horrendous Tale</h4>

<p class="fst">Then comes a horrendous tale, attributed to Kelly, about some
&ldquo;Trotskyites&rdquo; posing for newspaper pictures before the
Chevrolet gate, with copies of <B>The Militant</B> in their hands.
Kelly stated, according to Allan:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;I checked up later on this quartet and found that
they had sent the workers home. Let me tell you some more about these
people because we are sick of them in Flint and we are going to do a
job on them, right, Tex?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Tex Owens is then said to have replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,
Tom, tell him about the meeting.&rdquo; Throughout the article Owens
is quoted as a chorus to Kelly.</p>

<p>The article continues with a harassing account about the
&ldquo;Trotskyites&rdquo; allegedly disrupting a Chevrolet Local
meeting. Kelly is then quoted as saying:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;In conclusion we passed a motion in our local that
their lousy sheet, <B>The Militant</B>, shall not be allowed to be
distributed ... They are the fifth column alright and it&rsquo;s time
we stopped ignoring them throughout the union and take the bull by
the horns like we did in Chevrolet. Our next move is to boot them out
if they continue to disrupt and we know they will.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Allan then writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;We asked Tex Owens, union president, what he
thought of Kelly&rsquo;s statement. Tex said, &lsquo;Tom speaks my
sentiments about these birds, exactly.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Answers Stalinists</h4>

<p class="fst">Immediately after the mass meeting at which the <B>Daily Worker</B>
with this lying account was distributed, I sought out Tex Owens and
found him surrounded by Chevrolet workers.</p>

<p>One executive board member was questioning Owens in regard to the
article. He asked, &ldquo;Was it true that there was any disruption
at the last meeting of the local?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Owens replied, &ldquo;No. There was none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was then shown a copy of the <B>Daily Worker</B>. In answer to
a question from this reporter about the other statements attributed
to him in Allan&rsquo;s article, Owens said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;I never confirmed any of these statements in this
paper. I don&rsquo;t recall Kelly making any such statements to
Allan. You can quote me on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Kelly did not deny giving the report to Allan. However, he
sheepishly dissociated Owens from his own remarks to Allan!</p>

<p>The statement about the Chevrolet Local barring <B>The Militant</B>
by passage of a motion is a pure Stalinist invention. One wonders how
even the brazen Stalinists hoped to palm off such a piece of outright
fiction on the Chevrolet workers.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Pure Invention</h4>

<p class="fst">No ruling against <B>The Militant</B> has ever been passed by the
local. Even Kelly has admitted to this reporter that this is the real
fact of the matter. On the contrary, <B>The Militant</B> is being
distributed, and has been each week, to thousands of Chevrolet
pickets, who receive it eagerly.</p>

<p>As for the truly fantastic charge that Trotskyists, who fought the
no-strike pledge throughout the war and have called for extension of
the CIO strikes to aid the GM workers, sent pickets home &ndash; that
is a lie that requires no answer for any thinking person. Only a
Stalinist poison pen artist would have the gall to attempt to peddle
this to the GM strikers here.</p>

<p>The Chevrolet local has the best picket lines in the city of
Flint, perhaps in the state of Michigan. After reading <B>The
Militant</B> for seven consecutive weeks, these workers know that <B>The
Militant</B> wholeheartedly supports the GM strikers in every way
possible. It is for this reason that the paper is accepted in the
most friendly spirit by all workers on the picket lines.</p>

<p>Thus, from beginning to end, the <B>Daily Worker</B> article is
constructed with crass falsehoods. It is an attempt to stir up the
corporation stooges and the conservative elements in the unions to
begin a red-baiting campaign in Flint and elsewhere.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Red-Baiting Campaign</h4>

<p class="fst">For the last few days General Motors Corporation has hinted to
their stooges through paid advertisements that such a disruptive
red-baiting campaign is in order. Walter Reuther, UAW vice-president,
in his speech at the GM strike mass meeting, nailed this attempt
immediately when he pointed out that in the eyes of the corporation
all new demands of the workers are viewed as &ldquo;revolutionary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several members of the Communist Party of Flint have openly
expressed to this reporter dissatisfaction with the <B>Daily Worker</B>&rsquo;s
article. As one of the CP leaders at Chevrolet put it, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know why Allan had to lie about those points. He sure botched the
job!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These Stalinist rank and filers know that a red-baiting campaign
in Flint, such as this article attempts to provoke, will be directed
not only against the Trotskyists, but also against members of the
Communist Party. Only the corporation and its stooges can benefit
from it.</p>

<p>This first attempt of the Stalinists to open a smear campaign
against the militant workers here has boomeranged. But this miserable
flop should serve as a warning to all thinking workers and members of
the Communist Party of the lengths to which the cynical and corrupted
Stalinist leaders will go to halt the advance of the militant forces
in the union.</p>
