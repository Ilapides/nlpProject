<p class="fst">FLINT, Mich., Dec. 28 &ndash; Under threat of
injunctions, the four General Motors union locals of Flint have
permitted office and supervisory employees into the strike-bound GM
plants. This policy was decided upon most reluctantly by the CIO
United Auto Workers officials and members at Buick, Fisher Body, AC
Spark Plug and Chevrolet.</p>

<p>Whereas last week witnessed several picket-line
skirmishes at AC before GM applied for the injunction, this week the
Buick local went through the same process.</p>

<p>At a specially called strike strategy meeting of the
Buick local it was decided to allow salaried help to enter the plants
providing they applied for permits at the union headquarters. After
scores of supervisors were denied admittance because of their refusal
to obtain passes from the union, terrific pressure was brought to
bear on the Buick strike committee by the regional UAW office.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Confusing Policy</h4>

<p class="fst">By a very close vote it was decided to permit entry
to all salaried employees who had passes. However, those who refused
to obtain permits would not be kept out if they insisted on crossing
the picket lines.</p>

<p>At all 15 gates, of the Buick factory, scores of
pickets circled the gates. Numerous cars were turned back when
pickets refused to open their lines.</p>

<p>Some of the union-hating supervision, knowing that
pickets would not stop them, edged their cars through the picket
lines. The confusing policy of the UAW regional officers produced
endless bewilderment among the pickets. More than one picket captain
threw up his hands in disgust when the cars started going through the
lines.</p>

<p>Several cops at the Leith Street gate advised
supervisors to go through the picket lines. &ldquo;The pickets won&rsquo;t
stop you,&rdquo; was the usual comment.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that two of the locals are
discussing ways and means of organizing the office workers. Union
officials see this as one possible solution to the present problem.
No organizational steps have been taken as yet.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Ranks Dissatisfied</h4>

<p class="fst">Despite a lull in the strike over the holidays there
is noticeable a growing dissatisfaction in the ranks over the policy
of the UAW International leaders. In discussion with this reporter
scores of militants mention time and again the vast difference
between the sit-down strikes and the present strikes. These militants
were the second rank leaders at Chevrolet and Fisher Body during the
heroic 1937 battles.</p>

<p>This undercurrent of criticism has been stirred by
the UAW top leaders&rsquo; proposal to provide &ldquo;company security&rdquo;
to Ford, a proposal quickly grabbed up by GM. Hundreds of militants
have voiced their opposition to it and have declared openly they
would fight it with the same determination and vigor with which they
fought the no-strike pledge.</p>

<p>The International leaders are quite aware of this
dissatisfaction and intend to leave no stone unturned to ram their
policy down the throats of the GM workers. At the last Chevrolet
membership meeting, the International sent in Victor Reuther and
several local regional representatives to fight a proposal of the
Chevrolet militants who were recommending that the steel workers
advance their strike date from January 14 to January 1.</p>

<p>Despite the high-pressure speeches of the union brass
hats, 40 per cent of the members cast their votes for the proposal of
the progressives of the Chevrolet local.</p>
