<p class="fst">FLINT, Feb. 8 &ndash; A back-to-work movement started by two Flint women for the purpose of halting the General Motors strike fizzled out before it could even get under way. The two women announced, a special meeting for Flint women. Some 300 attended, but they were almost unanimous in support of the strike.</p>

<p>After wives of the striking workers explained the purpose of the strike and the necessity of backing it, the two women reversed their position and volunteered for strike and kitchen duty. A collection was taken to send President Truman a telegram asking him to take immediate steps to make General Motors Corporation bargain collectively with the CIO United Auto Workers. The remainder of the collection was turned over to the UAW-CIO strike fund.</p>

<p>A Buick union investigating committee this week discovered foremen working on hourly-rated jobs. Although the corporation is seeking an injunction against the local for so-called illegal picketing, the local decided to keep foremen out of the plant.</p>

<p>All 15 gates were blocked by Buick pickets. Only the personnel office was left open, for office help. As a result of the reinforced picketing an agreement was reached with the company, to be submitted at the membership meeting of the local this Sunday.</p>
