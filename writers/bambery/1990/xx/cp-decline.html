<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst">In 1938 Trotsky looked out from exile in Mexico on a Europe
entering a new world war. The Munich Agreement, handing the Nazis a
slice of Czechoslovakia, had just been reached between Hitler&#8217;s
Germany, Britain and France. The Western Communist Parties were
embracing their respective national flags, seeking alliances with the
most reactionary sections of society on the basis of opposition to
Germany. The Popular Front line imposed by Stalin was at its height.
Trotsky pinpointed a contradiction within the Communist Parties:</p>

<p class="quoteb">As regards the ex-Comintern, its social base, properly
speaking, is of a two-fold nature. On the one hand, it lives on the
subsidies of the Kremlin, submits to the latter&#8217;s commands, and in
this respect every ex-Communist bureaucrat is the younger brother and
subordinate of the Soviet bureaucrat. On the other hand, the various
machines of the ex-Comintern feed from the same sources as Social
Democracy, that is the super-profits of imperialism. The growth of
the Communist Parties in recent years, their infiltration into the
ranks of the petty bourgeoisie, their installation in the state
machinery, trade unions, parliaments, municipalities, etc., have
strengthened in the extreme their dependence on national imperialism
at the expense of their traditional dependence on the Kremlin.</p>

<p class="quote">Ten years ago it was predicted that the theory of
socialism in one country must inevitably lead to the growth of
nationalist tendencies in the sections of the Comintern ... Today we
can predict with assurance the inception of a new stage. The growth
of imperialist antagonisms, the obvious proximity of the war danger,
and the equally obvious isolation of the USSR must unavoidably
strengthen the centrifugal nationalist tendencies within the
Comintern. Each one of its sections will begin to evolve a patriotic
policy on its own account. Stalin has reconciled the Communist
Parties of the imperialist democracies with their national
bourgeoisies. This stage has now been passed ... Henceforth, the
communo-chauvinists will have to worry about their own hides, whose
interests will by no means always coincide with the &#8216;defence of the
USSR&#8217;. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky&#8217;s time scale was wrong. The monolith of World Communism
would remain intact through a number of further crucial shifts
imposed by Stalin. In particular the parties broke from their Popular
Front allies when Stalin sided with Hitler in September 1939 and then
again in 1947 when they were ordered to make a similar break with the
onset of the Cold War.</p>

<p>Yet within a year of that shift there came the first break in the
monolith, the split between Stalin and the Yugoslav leader Tito. The
Sino-Soviet split would produce further shock waves. Under pressure
from events in Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Poland in
1981 the Western Parties began openly distancing themselves from
Russia. At the same time Moscow relied less on using these parties as
a means of pressurising Western governments to establish friendly
relations with the Russian state.</p>

<p>By the mid-1970s the emergence of what would be termed
&#8216;Eurocommunism&#8217; saw Trotsky proved correct. A succession of
Western Communist Parties openly sought to transform themselves into
classical reformist parties. The Italian party (the PCI) led the way,
embracing support for Italian membership of NATO.</p>

<p>Finally, the shock of revolution in Eastern Europe in autumn 1989
and the collapse of its Stalinist regimes led to a further turn of
the wheel. In Italy the PCI announced it would be now named the
Democratic Party of the Left (PDS). The party leadership hoped to go
further and immerse themselves in a broad centre-left coalition. In
Britain the editor of <strong>Marxism Today</strong>, the magazine of the
Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), wrote in Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s
the <strong>Times</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Even the most conservative position on offer acknowledged
that democratic centralism, Marxism-Leninism, and the name Communism
should be ditched ...</p>

<p class="quote">Moreover, the death of the CPGB may well be part of the
slow death of the old Socialist left. If that is so &#8211; and I think
it is &#8211; the CP, in its final years, will have performed the useful
task of helping to bury it. That task is now more or less complete.
It is time to move on. RIP. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Jacques wishes to disband the party entirely. Its newly appointed
general secretary, Nina Temple, declared: &#8216;The title of the new
party is up for discussion. My personal preference is for the Radical
Party &#8211; or something like that.&#8217; She added: &#8216;I have never been
a Marxist-Leninist because it was too restrictive.&#8217; <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p>If one needed a precise moment for the death of the international
Communist movement 23 May 1990 would do-on that day Reuters sent out
this brief report:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The <strong>World Marxist Review</strong>, set up by Communist
Parties around the world to discuss the theoretical problems of
Marxism, is folding because of lack of interest. &#8216;There didn&#8217;t
seem to be any reason to continue publication&#8217;, the monthly
magazine&#8217;s liquidator, Jaroslav Precek, said in Prague yesterday. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The <strong>World Marxist Review</strong> was the last thread linking what
had once appeared a seamless Stalinist monolith, directed from Moscow.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>After the war</h4>

<p class="fst">The Western Communist Parties emerged from World War Two with
immense prestige. In France it was the Communist Party (PCF) that
formed the crucial cadre in the resistance to German occupation. The
Allied landings in Normandy were accompanied by a national uprising
which saw the Communist-led resistance forces liberate the bulk of
the country, including Paris. A national strike of railworkers
paralysed much of the transport on which the German army depended.
General de Gaulle confessed to his memoirs: &#8216;the leadership of the
fighting elements was in the hands of the Communists&#8217;. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p>In Italy on 24 April 1945 60,000 Milanese workers in the zone of
German occupation struck, setting up workers councils. The strike
spread to Turin and assumed insurrectionary levels, with 20,000
fascists executed (including Mussolini). In Greece the resistance
movement (EAM, dominated by the Greek Communist Party) liberated the
country without Allied help. A British observer reported that: &#8216;By
the time of liberation EAM numbered about 2 million members, out of a
total population of over 7 million ... There seemed to be nothing
that could stand against them.&#8217; <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p>In Spain, just six years after the victory of General Franco, it
seemed only a matter of time before the fascist dictatorship would
fall. Thousands of Communists and other leftists crossed the Pyr&#233;n&#233;es
to attempt to launch full scale guerilla war. Even in Britain and the
United States, the most stable of the Western powers, Communism was a
growing force. In 1945 two Communist MPs were elected to Britain&#8217;s
House of Commons. In the United States the CPS membership reached
100,000 by 1944.</p>

<p>The prestige of Stalin&#8217;s Russia, which had fought Hitler
virtually single handedly from 1941 to 1944, plus the CPs&#8217; role in the
resistance gave the Communist Parties immense prestige. That
coincided with a wave of radicalisation which raised the spectre of
revolutionary change in the West.</p>

<p>The PCF grew from 292,701 members in 1937 to 371,471 in 1944 and
616,348 in 1945. In Austria the CP grew from 16,000 members in 1935
to 150,000 in 1948; in Finland the party grew from 1,200 in 1940 to
150,000 in 1946; in Italy the PCI grew from 402,000 in 1944 to 2
million plus in 1946; in Denmark membership stood at 9,000 in 1939
but reached 75,000 in 1945; in in Norway membership went up from
5,272 in 1939 to 45,000 in 1946 whilst in Japan, where the CP was
underground and tiny before the war&#8217;s end, it polled two million
votes in 1946, winning five seats (by 1949 it took 3 million votes
and 35 seats). <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p>Nineteen forty-five seemed a year pregnant with possibilities for
socialist change. Yet as events were to show Western capitalism not
only stabilised itself, breaking free from the protracted crisis of
the 1920s and 30s, but entered into its greatest and most sustained
economic boom. Central to capitalism&#8217;s ability to achieve this was
the role played by the Western Communist Parties under the
instructions of Stalin. As the former Spanish Communist Party (PCE)
leader, Fernando Claudin writes: &#8216;only the Communist Parties could
halt the revolutionary movement of the proletariat, and in practice
this is what they did.&#8217; <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p>Stalin had already made it clear he wanted the continuation of the
grand wartime alliance and was content with the carve up of the world
achieved at Yalta. In 1943 he formally buried the corpse of the
Communist International. It meant little in practice but it
demonstrated to the Allies that Stalin renounced even the rhetoric of
what the US Vice President Henry Wallace called in March 1943 &#8216;the
Trotskyist idea of fomenting world-wide revolution&#8217;. Instead Stalin
wanted a far reaching agreement with US imperialism based on sharing
out &#8216;spheres of influence&#8217;. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p>In brutal terms Stalin was willing to restrain the hands of the
Communist Parties in order to get Eastern Europe. This can be traced
in the histories of the French, Italian and Greek Communist
Parties.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>i) Rebuilding &#8216;La France Eternelle&#8217;:</em> The exiled French
Communist leader, Maurice Thorez, returned from Moscow in November
1944 to declare &#8216;One state, one police force, one army.&#8217; <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a> De
Gaulle had only granted a pardon for Thorez when it became clear the
PCF was not going to challenge for power.</p>

<p>The concrete issue was the the maintenance of the patriot
militias and committees of liberation. Thorez backed their
dissolution by de Gaulle. The General commented in his memoirs: &#8216;From
the moment of his return to France Thorez has been helping to clear
up the traces of the &#8220;patriot militias&#8221;.&#8217; <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> The PCF now
threw itself into the restoration of what it termed &#8216;<em>la France
eternelle</em>&#8217; through a &#8216;battle for production&#8217;. The campaign
reached its peak when Thorez told striking miners, &#8216;we must stop
playing at civil war and not allow provocations against the working
class and our country&#8217;. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>Despite this, and despite a voting system discriminating against
the Communists, the PCF emerged as the biggest single party in the
election of October 1945. De Gaulle needed the PCF in order to keep
the working class in check. Their price for collaboration was not
high. De Gaulle made it clear they could have ministries in his his
government dealing with economic affairs but not with responsibility
for foreign affairs, the police or the army.</p>

<p>For the next two years the PCF in government loyally pursued the
policy of reconstructing &#8216;<em>la France eternelle</em>&#8217;. When
French troops gunned down thousands in response to the first major
demonstrations for Algerian independence in early 1945 the PCF&#8217;s
daily paper defended the shootings. This defence of France&#8217;s
overseas empire reached even more grotesque levels when France
launched an all out war against Ho Chi Minh&#8217;s Vietminh, who had
liberated the French colony of Vietnam. For four months at the start
of the war there was a Communist minister of defence conducting the
war against Ho Chi Minh.</p>

<p>In March 1947 the Communist ministers voted for war credits in
order to maintain &#8216;government solidarity&#8217;. In all of this the PCF
was slavishly following the line from Moscow.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>ii) Italy &#8211; revolution averted:</em> In March 1944 the PCI and
the Socialist Party (PSI) issued a joint appeal for a general strike
across the north of the country, which was still under German
occuption. Over a million workers responded, representing the most
important working class action in occupied Europe during the war.</p>

<p>The PCI&#8217;s exiled leader, Palmiro Togliatti, counterposed a
nationalist message to the struggle of the working class which had
reached the point of dual power in Turin, Milan and Genoa. Togliatti
arrived in Naples in March 1944. The situation was this: In July 1943
the king and Marshall Badoglio had ousted Mussolini in a coup. Both
had been loyal supporters of <em>Il Duce</em>. But now Badoglio saw his
chief aim as forestalling the bitterness accumulated under two
decades of fascism from exploding into a revolutionary upsurge.</p>
<p>The PCI and PSI had entered discussions with Badoglio but these
broke down because of the repressive moves he had initiated and his
benign policy towards the Germans. The PCI and PSI continued to call
for the removal of the king and Badoglio whom they argued, correctly,
were a survival of fascism. When Churchill mocked these views the
workers of Naples struck and the campaign against Badoglio swept the
southern half of the country.</p>

<p>But at the height of this agitation in March 1944 Badoglio could
announce the recognition of his government by Stalin (something
Churchill and Roosevelt had still not granted). At the end of March
the newly returned Togliatti, in the words of his officially approved
biography, proposed &#8216;the immediate setting up of a government of
national unity&#8217;. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p>Togliatti carried with him the full authority of Stalin and if
Moscow had backed the Badoglio government that is what Communists had
to accept. The whole affair was officially termed by the PCI, the
<em>svolta di Salerno</em> (the Salerno switch). The <strong>Soviet
Encyclopedia</strong> explained events thus: &#8216;On the initiative of the
USSR, which had established direct relations with the Italian
government on 11 March, the Badoglio cabinet was re-organised on 22
April 1944 to include representatives of the six parties of the
anti-Fascist coalition.&#8217; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>While the PCI joined in creating &#8216;national unity&#8217; the ruling
class concentrated on muzzling the movement of the masses in southern
and central Italy before the north was liberated. &#8216;The north wind&#8217;,
the radicalisation sweeping south from Turin and Milan dominated
Italian political life.</p>

<p>The PCI made its position on the partisans in the north clear. It
accepted the &#8216;Rome Protocol&#8217; with the Allies and the government
(now led by a former Socialist, Bonomi), which agreeing to Allied
instructions on the conduct of the war and an Allied officer as
overall military leader. The PCI&#8217;s own <strong>Storia della Resistenza
Italiana</strong> admits:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It seems as if the liberation movement was forced, with
this agreement, to make heavy concessions; in reality the Allies
simply obtained confirmation that the partisan movement &#8216;would not
make a revolution&#8217;, which, obviously, was worrying them. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Throughout the Winter of 1944&#8211;45 the Allies observed a <em>de
facto</em> truce whilst the Germans and their fascist allies launched
offensive after offensive against the partisans. In April 1945 (with
Germany on the verge of collapse) the Allies moved but by then the
partisans had liberated much of the north.</p>

<p>A retrospective view by PCI leader Luigi Longo described the
situation as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">When the Allied authorities reached the north with their
troops, they began to remove from important posts the men of the
resistance appointed by the national liberation committees, and
replaced them with officials from the old administrative apparatus. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Yet Togliatti told the PCI&#8217;s fifth congress in December 1945,
&#8216;We are all united by our agreement to have no recourse to violence
in the struggle between the parties. This agreement calls for the
disarming of all, and we were the first to carry it out.&#8217; <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a> In
the new post-war government the PCI, dragging the PSI with it,
offered concession after concession to the Christian Democrats. The
crunch came in December 1945 when the Christian Democrats appointed
one of their own leaders as head of government and consolidated their
hold on the state.</p>

<p>In the January 1946 elections the Christian Democrats became the
major party in Italy after two years of &#8216;national unity&#8217;. None of
this was inevitable. The Christian Democrats were far from being the
major political force when the war ended. Togliatti admitted the PCI
had not distinguished itself enough from the Christian Democrats:
&#8216;their economic and social programme was no different from that of
the Communists and Socialists&#8217;. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p>Whilst they had 40 percent of the population&#8217;s support the PCI,
with the PSI tailing behind, acted as loyal members of a Christian
Democrat government. The peace treaty imposed on Italy was massively
unpopular and it took all the efforts of the PCI (following Moscow)
to secure its acceptance. Togliatti agreed to recognition of
Catholicism as the state religion, a ban on divorce and recognition
of the privileged position of the Vatican.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>iii) The Greek tragedy:</em> Despite the fact that Greece had
been liberated by the forces of EAM resistance under the leadership
of the Greek Communist Party (KKE) the party&#8217;s leaders recognised
the agreement between Stalin and Churchill which placed Greece in the
British sphere of influence.</p>

<p>Following the Moscow line EAM entered a coalition government under
the regency of Archbishop Damaskinos. A KKE manifesto in October 1944
stated, &#8216;It is everybody&#8217;s primary national duty to ensure order
and a smooth political life for the country. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> While the British
troops who occupied Athens under General Scobie were welcomed as
&#8216;liberators&#8217;, Churchill was sending these instructions to Eden,
his representative in the Mediterranean:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In my opinion , having paid the price we have to Russia
for freedom of action in Greece, we should not hesitate to use
British troops to support the Royal Hellenic Government under M.
Papandreou ... I fully expect a clash with EAM, and we must not
shrink from it, provided the ground is well chosen. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When Scobie ordered EAM to disarm full-scale war followed.
Churchill visited Athens to tell EAM leaders: &#8216;The British had gone
into Greece with the agreement of President Roosevelt and Marshall
Stalin.&#8217; <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a> The head of the Russian mission, who stayed in the
British military&#8217;s headquarters throughout the fighting, was
present and confirmed Churchill&#8217;s statement. Two days later when
negotiations had broken down and the RAF was strafing Athens Stalin
appointed an ambassador to the Royal Hellenic Government.</p>

<p>The fighting ended when EAM signed an armistice to coincide with
the summit at Yalta. Stalin declared: &#8216;I have confidence in the
British government&#8217;s policy in Greece.&#8217; <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a> The ceasefire saw
the British and the monarchy unleash a wave of fascist terror on
supporters of the wartime partisans. At the end of 1946 full-scale
civil war began. But by now the Communists were in a far less
favourable position and the Americans provided more and more weaponry
(including napalm) supplanting the British.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The honeymoon ends</h4>

<p class="fst">At the beginning of 1947 countries which had Communists in
government included Austria, Belgium, France, Iceland, Italy, Chile
and Finland. Then in May of that year, in a universally repeated
move, both the PCF and PCI ministers were dismissed.</p>

<p>The post-war agreement could not hold. Neither side was satisfied
with the partition of the world agreed at Yalta. Whilst Russia had
dominance of Europe in conventional military terms, only America had
the atomic bomb. Above all in 1947 Western Europe&#8217;s economic
reconstruction was the crucial question. Unemployment and inflation
still dragged at many of Europe&#8217;s economies. Massive investment was
needed. The only possible source of this was the USA, but this
carried with it acceptance of US economic hegemony.</p>

<p>It also opened the door for the US in Eastern Europe. Many of
those ruling the countries of what was termed the &#8216;Buffer Zone&#8217;
were keen to gain US aid. Stalin could not countenance that.</p>

<p>The opening shots of the Cold War began in March 1947 when
President Truman announced US intervention in the Greek civil war.
This would become known as the Truman doctrine &#8211; the declaration of
America&#8217;s intention to intervene military to defend its perceived interests.</p>

<p>In June Washington announced the Marshall Plan for economic aid to
Europe. The aim was to revive western Europe as a market and to
integrate it fully into the US bloc. Part of the price of accepting
Marshall aid was removal of the CPs from office. Initially Togliatti
announced Italy would welcome the aid. And in July 1947 the Czech
government agreed to discuss aid terms with Washington. But then on 2
August Moscow rejected the plan and CPs everywhere fell into line.</p>

<p>Other pressures were also at work. In France growing working class
discontent with low wages and high prices threatened to undercut the
PCF&#8217;s base. In April a strike over wages swept through the giant
Renault car plants. In the absence of a lead from the PCF or CGT the
few Trotskyist militants in Renault seized the opportunity.</p>

<p>On 30 April Thorez, under growing pressure from this movement told
the cabinet the PCF could no longer support the government on prices
and wages. A vote of confidence was arranged and after voting against
the government the PCF left office.</p>

<p>Yet the party&#8217;s leadership had little inkling that an historic
chapter was over. The difficulties over Marshall aid were seen as
temporary. Thorez still presented the PCF as the real &#8216;party of
government&#8217;. And aging party leader Marcel Cachin asked the 11th
party congress in June of that year in reference to Thorez: &#8216;What
madness made them get rid of such a statesman?&#8217; <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p>In Italy the PCI was dismissed from government shortly after the
prime minister, de Gasperi, returned from a visit to Washington.
Togliatti complained that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">An intelligent and capable adversary would not have
removed us from the government. Quite the opposite, he would have
taken us at our word as regards our declared aims, and would have
dared us to stick to them. He would have worked to create a situation
in which we could have been overwhelmed with no hope of escape and
from which we could only emerge crushed. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Yet just as this was happening Stalin was preparing to pull the
PCF and PCI into line, demanding yet another change in their
political strategy. This would be as dramatic as the shift to the
Third Period in 1928, the shift to the Popular Front in the mid-1930s
and the somersaults over the attitude to War required in 1939 and 1941.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Cominform straitjacket</h4>

<p class="fst">In October 1947 the Communist Parties of the USSR, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, France and
Italy met in secret in Poland to found the Cominform, the Communist
Information Bureau. At first sight it must have seemed to Communists
throughout the world as the resurrection of the Comintern, the
Communist International. But the list of invitations, drawn up by
Stalin, gave the game away.</p>

<p>A number of the states in the &#8216;buffer zone&#8217; had responded
enthusiastically to the lure of Marshall aid. The economies of these
states were still closely linked to the West. On 4 July 1947 the
Czech government agreed to take part in the Paris conference summoned
to discuss the Marshall Plan. (The Communist Party was a minority
within the Czech government, albeit one which controlled the armed
bodies of the state).</p>

<p>In Poland Communists were discussing participating in the Marshall
Plan. Stalin decided the matter for them. On 8 July Radio Moscow
announced Poland had refused to participate in the Paris conference.
On the same day a Czech delegation left for Moscow to be told bluntly
by Stalin that there was no question of even discussing participation
in the Marhall Plan.</p>

<p>The satellites had to act as such. Within the &#8216;buffer zone&#8217;
the Communist Parties, using their control of the police and army,
backed by the Red Army, moved to oust their partners in the coalition
governments which had existed since 1945, and created People&#8217;s
Democracies. The people were not consulted.</p>

<p>Stalin&#8217;s response to Washington&#8217;s attempt at forcing its
political and economic hegemony on Europe was to switch to a hard
line in his dealings with his former allies. His aims were simple: to
secure control of Eastern Europe (winning recognition from the West
that the post-war division was permanent) and prevent the US from
combining all the Western European countries, including Western
Germany, into a single bloc under Washington&#8217;s control. The
Cominform was no indication of desire to launch a new revolutionary
wave against US imperialism. The aims were the same as at Yalta.
Stalin was simply changing from a soft to a hard line in order to
force Washington to recognise bipartite control of the world.</p>

<p>Stalin had already agreed to surrender the Third World to the
Allies. That explains the absence of the Chinese Communist Party from
the Cominform (at the moment they were on the verge of power). The
Greeks had already been abandoned: first to Churchill, and now to
Truman. The PCP and PCI were invited because they were the two most
important parties in the crucial area of Western Europe. The Albanian
Communist regime was barred from the Cominform at the insistence of
Yugoslavia. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p>When the Comintern was dissolved in 1943 the statement announcing
its termination spelt out the way ahead for the Communist Parties: a
supporting role for the wartime grand alliance, an alliance Stalin
wished to see continue after victory over the Axis.</p>

<p>Now the report delivered on behalf of Stalin by his henchman,
Zhdanov, argued the way ahead for a period which lasted until
Stalin&#8217;s death in 1953. Zhdanov argued that the world had split
into two camps: &#8216;the imperialist and anti-democratic camp on the
one hand and the anti-imperialist, democratic camp on the other&#8217;.
<a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a> The whole concept rested on a world divided between states and
blocs of states, not classes. The working class, and the Communist
Parties in the rival bloc, played an entirely subordinate role.
Nowhere in Zhdanov&#8217;s report or in the subsequent declaration of the
nine parties was there any mention of the fight for socialism. Rather
the &#8216;fundamental task&#8217; of the anti-imperialist camp was &#8216;to
ensure a lasting democratic peace&#8217;.</p>

<p>The tasks set out centred on achieving an alliance to preserve
&#8216;national independence&#8217; and &#8216;democracy&#8217;. The report did not
rule out alliances with sections of the European bourgeoisie who
might oppose Washington&#8217;s plans. Zhdanov went out of his way to
talk of the &#8216;possibility of collaboration between the USSR and
countries with different systems, on condition that the principle of
reciprocity is observed and agreements made are kept&#8217;. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p>The Cominform period also saw a return to a marked hostility by
the Communist press to social democracy. But unlike the Third Period
of 1928&#8211;34 reformists were not all labelled &#8216;social-fascists&#8217;.
Great care was taken to distinguish between those social-democrats
allied to Washington and those friendly to Moscow.</p>

<p>The Stalinist approach to the mass reformist parties in the West
always began with Moscow&#8217;s perception of whether it judged
particular Western powers to be potential allies. The orientation on
the reformist parties begins with their leadership. These leaders
orientate on <em>their</em> national states, and <em>their</em> ruling
classes. They could either influence these ruling classes or could
articulate the particular argument of these rulers within the labour
movement. Nowhere was the starting point the need to win common
<em>action</em> with reformist workers and, when possible, their
leaders, against the employers and their state.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Back to the streets</h4>

<p class="fst">The level of class struggle rose across Western Europe between
1947 and 1950. This was not the result of the Communist plot, alleged
by Western bourgeoisie. Rather it was a defensive response by the
working class to an employers&#8217; offensive aimed at imposing
rationalisation in order to lay the basis for participation in the
Great Boom opening before them.</p>

<p>Even before Cominform the Communist Parties been forced to shift
towards united identification with this resistance (witness the PCF&#8217;s
eventual response to the strike at Renault in 1947).</p>

<p>In the 18 months after the PCF left office strikes involving more
than 2 million workers swept France. Having been forced to react the
PCF tried to impress Moscow by giving this movement a political edge.
The CGT was forced to include amongst its aims opposition to the
Marshall Plan and a call for the banning of the atomic bomb (still a
US monopoly).</p>

<p>The French government &#8211; including the social-democrats &#8211;
conjured up a &#8216;Communist plot&#8217; which allowed it to unleash a wave
of repression against the strikes. In the major towns and cities
clashes took place between workers and the forces of repression.
Communist militants were in the front line, displaying great courage
and attempting to give a lead.</p>

<p>But what was the aim of the powerful resistance they spearheaded?
Was it simply to defend and improve living standards, or was it to
force the French ruling class to allow the PCF to re-join the
government, or to destabilise France and thus the emerging Western
Alliance? The PCF leadership itself was unclear.</p>

<p>Late in 1947 the CGT split. The Socialist leader, Leon Blum, had
used the PCF&#8217;s own statements to good effect, proving its
subordination to Moscow and the need for a new independent union
federation: the new federation, <em>Force Ouvri&#232;re</em>, took 500,000
CGT members. Massive amounts of US money and expertise were used to
stabilise the new union. <em>Force Ouvri&#232;re</em> probably never even
reached a million members but it helped undermine working class
resistance. A miners&#8217; strike in late 1948 collapsed after miners
began returning to work and the CGT ordered the strike&#8217;s end. In
1950 a strike across the crucial Michelin combine ended in failure.
The pattern of declining struggle soon became clear &#8211; CGT
membership which had topped 5 million in 1947 fell to just over 2
million by the mid-1950s. The PCF had also begun its long decline in
membership which has continued until today. In 1947 it claimed
700,000 registered members in 1954 it claimed to issue 500,000 party
cards (a figure which would be higher than those formally registered).</p>

<p>In Italy the PCI was in a more favourable situation. Whilst the
PCP found itself in complete isolation the PCI preserved its alliance
with Nenni&#8217;s PSI (a break away Socialist Party specialising in
witch-hunting the PCI, formed in January 1947). The two parties
entered the March 1948 election to speculation that they would
improve on the (almost) 40 percent of the vote they had won in 1946.</p>

<p>Faced with the threat of a left victory the US moved to buttress
the Christian Democrats. The first Marshall aid ships arrived amidst
much publicity, while Truman returned gold seized by the Nazis and
made a gift of 29 merchant ships. The US State Department stated that
PCI voters would be prevented from emigrating to America. Other more
direct measures were used. US and British warships anchored off major
Italian ports. The Vatican chipped in, threatening to deny absolution
to PCI-PSI voters.</p>

<p>Despite hopes of victory the left list gained only 31 percent of
the vote, whilst the Christian Democrats share climbed to 48.5
percent. As in France, the employers were able (with the help of US
cash) to split the CGIL, ensuring that it became more marginal in
firms like Fiat.</p>

<p>The PCI was able to limit the damage to its fortunes. It reached
its post-war membership peak in 1953 with over 2 million members and
took 22.5 percent of the vote that year. Because of this success
Togliatti has been held up as an independent figure by the PCI, one
relatively untainted by Stalinism. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a>But in 1951, ever the loyal
Stalinist, he told the Seventh PCI Congress he was willing to tame
working class action in return for changes by the Italian government
in their attitude to Russia.</p>

<p>Across Europe the Cominform period was one of declining membership
for the Communist Parties. Claudin offers the following figures:</p>

<p class="fst">In 1948 the American Communist Party (CPUSA) adopted what became
known as the &#8216;five minutes to midnight line&#8217;. The party warned of
a new depression, the triumph of domestic fascism and war between the
USA and Russia.</p>

<p>In line with this doomsday scenario the CPUSA threw its all into
the &#8216;Third Party&#8217; presidential campaign of Henry
Wallace-Roosevelt&#8217;s wartime vice-president who favoured maintaining
close links with Moscow. But Wallace came nowhere and in the trade
unions the bureaucrats moved to break the CPUSA&#8217;s not
inconsiderable presence in a number of key unions.</p>

<p>Isolated, the CPUSA&#8217;s central leaders found themselves brought
to trial under wartime legislation &#8211; more than a hundred would be
jailed. Members and ex-members were barred from jobs, deported or had
their war pensions rescinded. Amidst this witch-hunt, which would be
identified with Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy, the party reacted by
launching an internal purge of &#8216;unreliable elements&#8217;, in
imitation of the purges in the People&#8217;s Democracies and by going
underground. The effects were to decimate party membership and
deliver hundreds of embittered ousted members into the hands of the FBI.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the name of its journal &#8211; <strong>For a Lasting Peace</strong>
&#8211; suggests the overall goal of the Cominform was to create a
powerful peace movement. The aim was to create a classic
international Popular Front organisation, on the lines of the 1930s,
in order to pressurise Western governments into accepting what Moscow
termed &#8216;peaceful co-existence&#8217;. In 1950 the World Peace Congress
gave birth to the World Peace Council which issued the famous
<em>Stockholm Appeal</em> for the banning of nuclear weapons. Some 500
million signatures were collected including &#8216;the whole adult
population of the USSR, the whole adult population of the People&#8217;s
Democracies and of 223 million Chinese&#8217;. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p>The whole exercise &#8211; with its stress on winning the signatures
of individual &#8216;peace fighters&#8217; and on winning respectable
establishment figures &#8211; had a powerful effect on the day to day
work of the Communist Parties. Tied in with a need to climb the
ladder of trade union officialdom its effect was to lessen the
centrality of shopfloor organisation and, indeed, of class struggle.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The monolith cracks</h4>

<p class="fst">The first crack in the Stalinist monolith appeared on 28 June 1948
when the Cominform issued the following statement: &#8216;The Information
Bureau condemns the anti-Soviet attitude of the leaders of the
Communist Party of Yugoslavia as incompatible with Marxism-Leninism
and only fit for nationalists.&#8217; <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> In Paris <strong>Le Monde</strong> said
the news &#8216;was nothing short of a bomb&#8217;. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>Alone in Eastern Europe Tito had come to power on the back of a
mass movement. He had his own power base. Tito was an ultra-orthodox
Stalinist but his attempt to emulate Stalin by following his own
version of socialism in one country, i.e. of independent capital
accumulation on national lines, brought him into conflict with
Stalin&#8217;s determination to reduce Yugoslavia to the status of yet
another satellite.</p>

<p>In Eastern Europe a wave of show trials culminating in mass
executions were conducted against supposed sympathisers of Tito
(Communists who had led their respective parties on the ground and
not from Moscow during the war were suspected of being too
independent). The denunciation of Tito was accepted by the world
movement with little complaint.</p>

<p>For the KKE in Greece this was suicidal. They had depended heavily
on the Yugoslavs in the civil war. Now the party broke all links with
Tito (its border guards were told to fire on those attempting to
cross into Yugoslavia!). Victims of the subsequent purge included
many of the best elements in the partisan army. In the autumn of 1948
the CIA had been worried about the success of the KKE but from the
end of 1948 the balance of the war swung against the KKE.</p>
<p>All the Western parties churned out hack denunciations of the
Yugoslavs. By some coincidence both the French and British parties
produced literary delights with the identical title, <strong>From Trotsky
to Tito</strong>.</p>

<p>Tito quickly sought aid from the Western powers and Western
reformists. When the Cold War boiled over in Korea Tito backed United
Nations intervention. This helped ensure Tito&#8217;s breakaway did not
lead to any serious ruptures in the Western parties.</p>

<p>Another challenge to Moscow&#8217;s authority was also rising in the
East. In 1949 Mao Ze Dong proclaimed the Chinese Peoples Republic in
Tiananmen Square, Beijing. The Chinese Communist Party had seized
power despite Stalin. From the beginning relations between the two
powers were uneasy as both related to each other not through any
sense of proletarian internationalism but as two states thrown
together in the face of potential enemies.</p>

<p>Nineteen forty-nine was also the year the Russians completed a
successful atomic test. Washington hoped their hydrogen bomb would
maintain US advatange but the Pentagon knew Russia would soon be able
to deploy such an awful weapon. The nuclear gap was closing fast.</p>

<p>In fact it was announced that Russia had developed the hydrogen
bomb in August 1953. Until then the Western parties had been the one
threat which Stalin could employ, beyond risking war, to pressurise
the ruling classes of the West. Now the Russians were developing more
effective frontier guards.</p>

<p>But the Russians had other problems, a fact highlighted by
Stalin&#8217;s death. First, as more sophisticated means were needed to
administer a relatively modern industrial economy the old, simple
policy of overt repression could no longer deliver. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a> Second,
Stalin&#8217;s policy of rapprochement with the West was pursued more
vigorously by Russia&#8217;s rulers. Both blocs now stared out at each
other across a nuclear balance of power. That meant further
downgrading the Western Communist Parties. The Cominform ceased to
function in 1953, though its death was only pronounced in 1956.</p>

<p>Finally the idyll of Russia and Eastern Europe pictured to
millions of Western Communists and their fellow-travellers was ripped
apart. Vicious infighting between Stalin&#8217;s heirs also created its
own dialectic. At first the secret police chief, Beria, served as
scapegoat. In 1955 the new leader Khrushchev visited Yugoslavia
(which, as suddenly as it had become so, ceased to be a &#8216;fascist&#8217;
state) and explained to Tito that relations had been &#8216;disrupted&#8217;
because of material fabricated by that &#8216;agent of imperialism&#8217;,
Beria. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a> The presses churning out anti-Yugoslav propaganda had
ceased to turn sometime before.</p>

<p>Then came Khrushchev&#8217;s bombshell at the 20th party congress in
February 1956. He delivered two speeches. In public session he
limited himself to denouncing &#8216;the cult of the personality&#8217;
without named reference to Stalin. In private session, with foreign
visitors barred, it was now revealed that power had been not in the
hands of the workers or &#8216;the leading party&#8217; but an all-powerful
tyrant served by a vicious secret police. Evidence drew on matters
only tiny groups of Trotsky&#8217;s supporters had attempted to draw
attention to: the murder of the leaders of the Bolshevik Party,
Stalin&#8217;s responsibility for the disasters at the outset of the
German invasion and the glorification of the cult of the personality. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a></p>

<p>But all of this was blamed on the individual failings of Stalin.
In order to secure his own position and to institute a reform
programme to tackle emerging economic problems Khrushchev needed to
outmanouevre his opponents, but he could not undermine a system to
whose ruling class he himself belonged.</p>

<p>Stalin&#8217;s death had already led to the first explosion in Eastern
Europe, the workers&#8217; uprising in East Berlin. A building workers&#8217;
strike spread to other towns in East Germany. Russian tanks were sent
in to crush the uprising. The Western authorities in the other
sectors of the city showed they were prepared to let the Russians do
what they considered necessary in their sphere of influence.</p>

<p>But the biggest blow to Stalinism came with the crushing of a
mass, working class rising in Hungary in October 1956. This rising
reproduced all the features of working class revolts in Berlin 1919
or Barcelona 1936: the formation of workers councils; armed militia
units and mass strikes. At first Russian tanks &#8216;withdrew after
meeting popular resistance on the streets of Budapest. But the
Russians waited, beginning negotiations with the new government
before returning to raze whole areas of the capital to the ground.
The leaders of the government, headed by the old Communist Imre Nagy,
were to be executed. The whole affair stank of the suppression of the
Paris Commune.</p>

<p>All of this created a massive crisis within the Western parties.
At the time of the secret speech most activists had denied the leaks
in the Western press. The Australian CP&#8217;s paper argued: &#8216;don&#8217;t
fall for the press&#8217; series of attacks on the late J.V. Stalin at
the 20th congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union&#8217;. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a>
Delegates from the CPGB took shelter in denying any inkling of the
whole matter! At the congress itself Thorez alone among Communist
leaders mentioned Stalin&#8217;s name. Even Enver Hoxha of Albania
praised Khrushchev and refrained from mentioning the dead dictator.</p>

<p>In June 1956 the PCP politbureau criticised the lack of
consultation about the secret speech. In reality <strong>The New York
Times</strong>, to which the speech was deliberately leaked by the Russian
leadership, now counted for more than Thorez and the PCF. It was a
full two months after the speech before the CPGB&#8217;s Harry Pollitt
offered a &#8216;full explanation&#8217; in an article entitled <em>The 20th
Congress of the CPSU</em>. The standard Moscow line then on offer was
proffered: &#8216;in the last 20 years of Stalin&#8217;s life the carrying
through of the correct general line ... was accompanied by mistakes,
abuses and injustices arising from Stalin&#8217;s increasing dependence
on the security forces&#8217;. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p>But doubts were growing in the British party&#8217;s ranks. In July
1956 the first of three issues of a duplicated magazine, <strong>The
Reasoner</strong>, appeared. Copies were snapped up by party members who
flooded it with letters.</p>

<p>The editors, E.P. Thompson and John Saville, argued that within
the CP there were:</p>

<p class="quoteb">deep disagreements on the very meaning of &#8216;Marxism the
presence of grossly irrational and authoritarian attitudes
intermingled with claims to a &#8216;scientific analysis&#8217;; the
hardening of theory into dogma, of socialist education into
indoctrination. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thompson and Saville went further, casting doubts on the central
faith of Stalinism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">History has provided a chance for this re-examination to
take place; and for the scientific methods of Marxism to be
integrated with the finest traditions of the human reason and spirit
which we may best describe as humanism. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Both men would be suspended from the CPGB for their pains.</p>

<p>The Australian Communist Party admitted the party had developed
&#8216;tendencies towards exaggerated praise and adulation of individual
party leaders ... But it never grew to any proportions amongst us ...
it was rather alien to the Australian outlook for one thing&#8217;. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a>
In New York the effect of a reading of the secret speech to the
CPUSA&#8217;s National Committee was recalled by its chair, Steve Nelson:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I could see people, old Party leaders, crying in the
audience. When the report was finished, I made the first comment. I
said something like &#8216;This is not the reason why I joined the Party.
From now we have to reject this; we have to make our own decisions;
there are no more gods.&#8217; <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The American <strong>Daily Worker</strong> opened its letters pages to
discussion of the affair. When the State Department released a full
transcript of Khrushchev&#8217;s secret speech they printed it in full
with an editorial criticising the Russian leadership for not having
made it public.</p>

<p>Such was the atmosphere in the Western parties when the tanks went
into Budapest in October 1956. The delegates return and the
suppression of the workers&#8217; uprising triggered an earthquake which
shook the Communist monolith to its foundations. The party leaders
hurried to defend the line from Moscow.</p>

<p><strong>L&#8217;Humanit&#233;</strong> carried a statement from the Central
Committee of the PCP on 3 November which stated: &#8216;It is now obvious
that there existed in Hungary an illegal counter-revolutionary
movement, with foreign assistance and well-armed, prepared by
experienced cadres of the former fascist army.&#8217; <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a> But even the
disciplined PCF had difficulty getting their members to swallow this.
Pablo Picasso was among those who denounced the Russian invasion.
Militants within the CGT refused to distribute leaflets offering the
PCF&#8217;s explanation. By February 1957 the PCF had lost 70,000 members.</p>

<p>In Italy Togliatti loyally defended Khrushchev&#8217;s intervention.
In January 1957 he delivered a speech which stated: &#8216;... it was
clear that the aim was the annihilation of all the gains of the
revolution, the restoration of a new fascist regime, which would
quickly have become a cockpit of war provocation against all
socialist countries&#8217;. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p>But the PCI paid a price for this. The PSI leader Nenni defended
the Hungarian revolution and the alliance between the two parties was
breached. The CGIL also broke ranks to declare: &#8216;the CGIL ... finds
it deplorable that the intervention of foreign troops was requested
and occurred in Hungary&#8217;. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a> The PCI would retain its hold on the
CGIL but party membership fell from 2,036,000 in 1956 to 1,790,000 a
year later.</p>

<p>The crisis probably rocked the Communist Parties most deeply in
what were still the two major capitalist powers of the time: the US
and Britain. The British party leadership loyally toed the Moscow
line, referring to &#8216;the White terror in Hungary&#8217;. But the party
paper&#8217;s own correspondent in Budapest, Peter Fryer, was sending
truthful reports of the revolution, sympatheitic to the workers.
These had to be suppressed by <strong>The Daily Worker</strong>.</p>

<p>The CPGB historian Christopher Hill was among 30 CP intellectuals
who wrote a dissident letter to <strong>The New Statesman</strong> and <strong>Tribune</strong>,
both journals identified with the Labour Party. Within the party
dissidence went beyond a small circle of intellectuals. A breakdown
of reported votes within various bodies of the party a month after
the uprising&#8217;s suppression gives a representative, if incomplete,
picture. A total of 3,582 members voted to back the party executive,
but 1,080 voted against and 414 abstained. A quarter of the
membership were defying the leadership.</p>

<p>An exodus from the party began. Christopher Hill, who left
himself, estimated that 7,000 left. The party&#8217;s own membership
figures state that membership fell from 33,095 in February 1956 to
24,670 in February 1958. The party leadership tried to argue the loss
could be put down to &#8216;intellectuals, of whom many lack a firm class
outlook, easily panic, and see in mistakes and setbacks the end of
everything&#8217;. In fact among those who resigned were trade union
leaders in the Electricians Union, the Fire Brigades Union and the
Scottish miners! <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p>Among those intellectuals who remained loyal was the historian
Eric Hobsbawm who argued in a letter to <strong>The Daily Worker</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">All Socialists ought to be able to understand that a
Mindszenty Hungary [Mindszenty was Hungary&#8217;s Catholic cardinal],
which would probably become a base for counter-revolution and
intervention, would be a grave and acute danger for the USSR,
Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Rumania which border upon it. If we
had been in the position of the Soviet government, we should have
intervened. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Hobsbawm supported the intervention &#8216;with a heavy heart&#8217; and,
whilst criticising the CPGB&#8217;s lack of democracy, stayed within the fold.</p>

<p>Most of those who departed would leave politics altogether or
drift rightwards. But a minority would move leftwards to break with
Stalinism. Out of 1956 and <strong>The Reasoner</strong> came today&#8217;s <strong>New
Left Review</strong>, whilst a small but crucial layer of activists would
move toward Trotskyist ideas, albeit in a distorted form. That would
be crucial to the rebirth of the revolutionary tradition in Britain.</p>
<p>At the CPUSA&#8217;s 1957 convention the dissidents actually formed a
majority of the delegates but compromised with the old pro-Khrushchev
leadership. For some Communists who had stuck through the witchunts
and the internal purges Hungary was the final blow. They upped and
left, to drift out of politics. Steve Nelson, a leader of the
dissidents, recalled:</p>

<p class="quoteb">we had a chance to take over the Party. We had a
majority. But what are you going to do when Gates gets up and says,
&#8216;I&#8217;m walking out&#8217;. And Charney says, &#8216;I&#8217;m walking out&#8217;.
[Gates and Charney were the crucial party leaders who backed the
dissidents] And the whole New York leadership decides to walk out. I
remained there for another eight months or so, and then I said, &#8216;What
the hell am I doing here?&#8217; and I walked out. <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Party membership shrank from 20,000 in January 1956 to half of
that by the summer of the next year and to a mere 3,000 by the
following summer. One party loyalist admitted:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The core of those who left was that whole generation of
younger people who had come into the party from the YCL, the Spanish
vets, and the people who had been active in the mass movements.
Afterwards there just wasn&#8217;t any real know-how people left in the
party, and we weren&#8217;t able to pick up the pieces. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Holding the line</h4>

<p class="fst">Yet as the fallout from Hungary cleared the Communist Parties were
able to rebuild and the old leaders re-established their hold. By the
beginning of the 1960s the Western parties had in many cases made up
their membership and electoral losses. The myth of a world communist
movement was still potent. In 1960 Moscow could still assemble
representatives from 81 parties in a seemingly united conference.</p>

<p>Yet the strains were becoming more and more visible. The Russian
leaders themselves were increasingly dismissive of the Western
Communists. As the Cold War melted away new friends and opportunities
were opening before them. The PCF had to swallow hard when the
Kremlin&#8217;s new chief idealogist, Suslov, told their July 1956 Congress:</p>

<p class="quoteb">For its part, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is
strengthening its friendship with the brother Communist Parties,
while seeking to establish and develop relations with the Socialist
Parties, including with the French Socialist Party. It is convinced
that these contacts will serve the cause of peace and socialism. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These same Socialists were members of the government waging a
savage colonial war in Algeria.</p>

<p>Increasingly too the trend toward social democracy was receiving a
fillip from Moscow. As early as 1951 the British party had adopted a
programme &#8211; <strong>The British Road to Socialism</strong> &#8211; drafted by
Cominform experts with Stalin&#8217;s direct encouragement, which mapped
out a parliamentary road to socialism.</p>

<p>After Khrushchev told the 20th congress of the possiblity of
Western parties, in alliance with the reformists, &#8216;winning a solid
majority in parliament and transforming this organ of bourgeois
democracy into an instrument of the true popular will&#8217;. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a> <strong>Pravda</strong> published an article by Togliatti spelling out the universal
applicability of this parliamentary road to socialism.</p>

<p>Throughout the late 1950s the PCF searched unsuccessfully for
alliances with the Socialists (or indeed anyone else available). That
meant dropping any criticism of the war in Algeria and refusing to
mobilise against virtual pogroms of Algerian immigrants. But all to
no avail. The party remained in isolation. In 1958 the Fourth
Republic broke under the strains of the Algerian war. The French
bourgeoisie turned to de Gaulle who assumed power on the basis that
he could run France as a presidential regime. In the election to
ratify de Gaulle&#8217;s position the PCF vote dropped by a million. In
the &#8216;red belt&#8217; of Paris, the PCF&#8217;s stronghold, de Gaulle won 68
percent of the vote.</p>

<p>The PCF was able to make up this temporary loss of support. It
remained bigger both in membership and in terms of votes than the
largely discredited Socialists. Under de Gaulle it could maintain a
verbal militancy whilst searching for ways to break the isolation of
the party. In 1965 it succeeded in uniting with the Socialists in
support of the presidential candidature of Fran&#231;ois Mitterrand.
Under Communist leadership the CGT maintained a rather ritualistic
opposition to de Gaulle, which took the form of periodic one day strikes.</p>

<p>In Italy the PCI found itself drifting into isolation. The
disintegration of its alliance with Nenni&#8217;s PSI culminated in 1963
when the PSI entered government in coalition with the Christian Democrats.</p>

<p>As the Socialists shifted rightwards the PCI outstripped them
electorally. The party successfully manouevred to maintain control of
the CGIL.</p>

<p>The PCI was also concerned to develop its independence from
Russia. In 1956 Togliatti had laid out his concept of polycentrism
whereby each Communist Party was to be fully autonomous, i.e. free
from Moscow&#8217;s direction. Although forced to recant this view
formally in 1961 Togliatti had let the genie out of the bottle.
Togliatti had already made it clear he saw nothing, except the matter
of support for NATO, which prevented the PCI joining the Christian
Democrat-Socialist coalition. Later that condition would be dropped.</p>

<p>In France and Italy the Communist parties retained mass support,
although just 20 percent and 30 percent of the working class
respectively were unionised. In Franco&#8217;s Spain it remained central
to the underground opposition. But in Northern Europe the picture was
different. In 1956 the West German government felt able to ban the
German Communist Party. In 1966 the Belgian party ceased producing a
daily paper and the Austrian party decided not to contest elections.
In Britain the CPGB placed more and more emphasis on its
parliamentary road but each election saw its already tiny vote fall,
despite standing more and more candidates. In 1945 21 candidates
received 102,780 votes. By 1970 58 candidates got 37,966 votes. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the world Communist movement had seen its biggest split:
in 1963 China and Russia broke relations. Within four years they were
clashing on their common border. The split had been brewing for
years. Both sides had argued against each other in coded language.
The radical rhetoric the Chinese rulers employed, with its argument
that nuclear war was not something to be avoided, had little
attraction for most Western Communists. In Europe the Chinese were
not able to build anything but tiny groups of die-hard Stalinists at
this stage. But Moscow&#8217;s authority had again been defied. &#8216;National
roads&#8217; now meant two &#8216;Communist&#8217; states sparring militarily.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>May &#8217;68 and after</h4>

<p class="fst">The May 1968 student demonstrations in Paris, triggering the
greatest general strike in working class history, brought the spectre
of working class revolution to the West. <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a> In the beginning PCF
leader Georges Marchais used crude workerism to attack the students.
But the party was forced to backtrack and defend the students. When
strikes began swelling into a general strike the CGT gave the
movement its sanction.</p>

<p>Whilst de Gaulle fled to consult with the generals in West Germany
power seemed to lie in the streets and the factories. But the PCF&#8217;s
slogans did not echo this rank and file upsurge. On 17 May they urged
&#8216;For an authentic, modern democracy in conformity with the
interests of the French people&#8217;. <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a> The PCF wanted to force the
Socialists and former Radicals into an electoral alliance. The CGT
wished to be treated as the crucial element by the employers and the
government in the bargaining process. In this it reflected the
classic concerns of any social democratic party.</p>

<p>In order to achieve these aims the party had to place itself at
the head of the movement during the French May and then to divert it
into safer channels. Thus the CGT backed factory occupations and
spread the strikes. But increasingly it argued they were simply about
economic issues. Their cadre ensured radical students had no contact
with the strikers. The PCF took to the streets <em>en masse</em> but
argued for the calling of elections and a common left slate.</p>

<p>The working class still saw the PCF as its party. The
&#8216;groupuscules&#8217; of the revolutionary left were too small to carry
the argument that the power with which the workers had paralysed
France could go further, to oust de Gaulle and go further still.</p>

<p>When de Gaulle called his opponents&#8217; bluff by calling elections,
Seguy, the head of the CGT responded by welcoming the elections. At
the same time the government and employers made massive concessions
over wages, hours and conditions. The CGT and other union federations
urged acceptance and a return to work. As the revolutionary wave of
May rededed into June they began to overcome the initial resistance
of workers, many of whom had refused to go back. The French May was over.</p>

<p>Italy did not undergo one, violent explosion like the French May.
But student protests helped trigger &#8216;the long hot autumn&#8217; of 1969
when mass strikes spread across the giant industrial concerns.
Revolutionaries began to build support on the factory floor but
through lack of clarity and inexperience were not able to break the
hold of the CGIL officials who, by 1971, had regained control of the
factory floor.</p>

<p>These events had been accompanied by yet another crisis provoked
by Russian action. In August 1968 Russian tanks went into action
again, this time to crush the Prague Spring. Whilst the reformist
Czech leaders talked the students and workers took to the streets and
struck. Whilst resistance did not involve actual fighting it was
clear that in the Czechoslovakian Peoples&#8217; Democracy the people
were in opposition.</p>

<p>The government&#8217;s reforms and promised liberalisation of
Czechoslovakia had been lauded by the Western Communist parties. They
took up the talk of &#8216;socialism with a human face&#8217;. The events of
1968 and the crushing of the Prague Spring pushed the Western parties
further down the road to hard social democracy. They were emerging
from the extra-parliamentary ghetto. In many countries they could
envisage the possibility of being allowed access to government. They
wanted to jump ship from the world Communist movement and knew their
members would not stomach any repeat of the lies of 1956.</p>

<p>Little of this mattered to the Russians. The Western parties were
of little importance by the late 1960s. When the Spanish Communist
Party&#8217;s Santiago Carrillo and Dolores Ibarruri, <em>La Pasionaria</em>
of civil war fame, approached the Russian leader Brezhnev about their
concerns he told them that the Western parties could &#8216;sound off &#8211;
but so what? ... For 50 years they have not mattered one way or another.&#8217;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Compromise, austerity and Eurocommunism</h4>

<p class="fst">The years from 1968 to 1974 were one of rising struggle across
much of the Western world. Revolutionary organisations emerged in
country after country and began to build among a minority of workers.
Most of these looked to Beijing and the radical rhetoric of Mao, but
others identified with the anti-Stalinist tradition of Trotsky.</p>

<p>In November 1969 the PCI expelled a grouping around Lucio Magri,
Rossana Rossanda and others who had begun publishing a monthly
journal <strong>Il Manifesto</strong>. It rejected cross class alliances and
argued Western Europe was ripe for socialism, and that the working
class and oppressed could take power. Together <em>Il Manifesto</em>,
<em>Avanguardia Operaia</em> and <em>Lotta Continua</em> could, at their
height, boast some 15,000 members. <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a></p>

<p>Italy saw the far left at its strongest, but similar developments
took place across the Western countries. Yet despite these advances
the resources in the hands of these revolutionaries were outstripped
by the scale of events. They could make some impact, they could lead
particular struggles even, but they were too new and too small to
break the hold of the traditional workers&#8217; parties.</p>

<p>One result was that, despite their politics, the reformist and
Communist parties benefited from this upsurge. In part the ruling
classes were forced to turn to them in the hope that these parties
could parry the working class advance.</p>

<p>The PCF were in the &#8216;Union of the Left&#8217; with Mitterrand&#8217;s
Socialists between 1971 and 1977. The PCF remained the larger party
both in terms of votes and members. For the PCI these were years of
growth. Between 1968 and 1971 the party recruited some 15,000 youth.
The PCI&#8217;s vote was steadily climbing.</p>

<p>In the mid-1970s these developments coincided with an event in
Latin America which was to turn the quantitative adaption to social
democracy into a qualitative shift to the politics of classic
reformism. In 1970 Salvador Allende had been elected president of
Chile at the head of a Popular Unity government which embraced the
Socialist Party, the Communist Party and various radical parties.
Allende had an absolute majority. The parliamentary road was being
put to the test. Across the world Communist Parties focused attention
on the &#8216;Chilean experiment&#8217;. Space does not permit a full account
of the events in Chile. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a> Suffice it to say that Popular Unity
found itself obstructed at every turn by a powerful alliance of the
employers, the military and US imperialism. This resistance sparked a
growing radicalisation among the working class which Popular Unity
tried to guide into constitutional channels. Eventually, as civil war
threatened, it urged the working class not to act, to stay off the
streets and not &#8216;worsen&#8217; the situation. The scene was set for the
brutal coup under General Pinochet in September 1973.</p>

<p>In reaction to the disaster of Chile the PCI leader Enrico
Berlinguer delivered his verdict: Popular Unity had gone too far, too
fast in polarising the situation. Addressing the Italian context he
called for a new departure arguing:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It&#8217;s not by obtaining 51 percent of the vote that the left wing
parties can be sure of governing and achieving their work of renewal
because a vertical split down the middle of our country would not be
in the interests of the country and would ruin the experiment of
renewing our society. That is what happened in Chile ... the
necessity to open at long last a sure road of economic development,
social renewal and democratic progress ... make it increasingly
necessary and pressing to arrive at what we call the great new
&#8216;historic compromise&#8217;. <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The compromise was made with the Christian Democrats. The spectre
of civil war in Italy was used to urge a convergence between the two
great parties of the contending classes in Italian society. Writing
in Britain, Eric Hobsbawm commented:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I believe it underlines the importance of maintaining
both unity and the broadest possible from of support. This may mean
what the Italian Communists now call a &#8216;historic compromise&#8217; &#8211;
i.e. governing down the pace of social change to what is acceptable
to the potential allies or the political neutrals among the middle
class. <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The importance of this shift cannot be overemphasised. First, in
Italy itself the crisis of the Western capitalist states had reached
its peak. The workers&#8217; movement was the most combatative in Europe.
Italy&#8217;s Communist Party was the largest in the West. The
revolutionary left was also the largest of any in the world and of
some influence internationally. It was widely expected that the PCI
and PSI would win an overall majority in the 1976 elections.</p>

<p>Second, the historic compromise was seized on by bourgeoisies
elsewhere as a way of using reformist and Stalinist parties to
&#8216;govern down the pace of social change&#8217;. It would be utilised in
Britain under a Labour government where the unions agreed to the
&#8216;social contract&#8217;. It would be used in Spain where the Spanish
Communist Party and the militant union federation it controlled
signed the Pact of Moncloa, geared to ensuring a peaceful transition
from Franco&#8217;s dictatorship to stable bourgeois democracy.</p>

<p>Third, the PCI was now making an historic break with its past. One
sign of this was Berlinguer&#8217;s support for NATO. In 1976 he told a
journalist it &#8216;safeguarded the Italian road to socialism&#8217;, adding
in reference to the Eastern Bloc, &#8216;I feel safer being on this side
of the fence.&#8217; <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a></p>

<p>In the 1976 election the PCI&#8217;s vote went up 7 percent to 34.4
percent (an all time high), but the Christian Democrats increased
their share of the vote to 38.7 percent. The failure of the left to
win an overall majority created a degree of demoralisation. In
keeping with the historic compromise the PCI agreed to support the
Christian Democrat government without being admitted to office. In
1977 it agreed an &#8216;emergency programme&#8217; of austerity measures
with the Christian Democrats. The British <strong>Economist</strong>
commentated that it &#8216;contained precious little a British
Conservative would sniff at&#8217;.</p>

<p>By 1979 the Christian Democrats felt confident enough to ditch the
historic compromise and rule without the crutch of the PCI. In that
year&#8217;s elections the PCI vote fell by 4 percent. One observer,
sympathetic to the PCI, sums up the historic compromise in this way:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The PCI accepted the international rules of the game:
inflation was enemy number one: to defeat it enormous sacrifices were
necessary. A &#8216;Social Contract&#8217; was drawn up: working class
austerity in exchange for defence of full employment and existing
purchasing power. Yet, at the same time, it was believed that it was
not possible to offer state led economic growth. This, in the
conditions prevailing then, meant no growth at all. Thus the working
class had to tighten its belt now in exchange for the promise that
later (much later) there would be growth. When growth eventually came
Craxi [the PSI leader in coalition with the Christian Democrats], the
labour movement and the unions had been defeated and the ground was
clear for &#8216;modernisation without reforms&#8217;.</p>

<p class="quote">Readers old enough to remember a Labour government will
perhaps recall that Healey&#8217;s strategy in 1976&#8211;79 was similarly
based. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The comparison is exact. In both Italy and Britain working class
advance was turned into retreat, living standards were reduced (in a
way Thatcher has been unable to achieve) and the policies we know as
&#8216;monetarism&#8217; or &#8216;Thatcherism&#8217; introduced. In both cases the
winners were the right wing.</p>

<p>The PCI&#8217;s break was central to what was termed Eurocommunism.
What defined Eurocommunism was the need to make an explicit break
with Russia and &#8216;actually existing socialism&#8217;. By dropping the
rhetoric and not just the allegiances of Stalinism a number of
Western parties wanted to prove their acceptability to their own
rulers. After all, the reason for their isolation in the 19503 was
that they were marked off from the social democrats precisely by the
link with Moscow.</p>

<p>In 1977 the general secretary of the Spanish Communist Party,
Santiago Carrillo, published <strong>Eurocommunism and the State</strong>. In
explaining Stalinism it borrowed from Trotsky&#8217;s <strong>Revolution
Betrayed</strong>, but rather than give a revolutionary critique of
Stalinism the book&#8217;s aim was to make a public break from the very
idea of revolution. Carrillo argued it was necessary to transform the
capitalist state &#8216;into a valid tool for constructing a socialist
society, without needing to destroy it radically by force&#8217;. <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p>In France the PCF&#8217;s 22nd Congress dropped the term &#8216;dictatorship
of the proletariat&#8217; from its programme and renounced the Russian
model of socialism. But this flirtation with Eurocommunism came up
against a problem.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of Fran&#231;ois Mitterrand the Socialist Party
had modernised itself and had begun to rebuild its support,
benefitting from the Union of the Left. Increasingly Mitterrand was
emerging as the crucial figure in this alliance. In 1976 an opinion
poll showed 38 percent of industrial workers would vote Socialist
compared with 34 percent who would vote Communist. In 1977 the PCF
under Georges Marchais broke with the Socialists, denouncing
Mitterrand as an &#8216;unacceptable ally&#8217;. The series of faction
fights, expulsions and resignations continue today.</p>

<p>The PCF turned &#8216;left&#8217; &#8211; back towards its Stalinist legacy.
The PCF would back General Jaruzelski&#8217;s coup in 1981 and would
welcome Russia&#8217;s invasion of Afghanistan. Its propaganda focused on
attacking Mitterrand and the Socialists in order to recoup its
losses. At the same time the PCF was prepared to court rather more
unsavoury elements in French society. As racism began to rise the
party paper stated that &#8216;immigration must be stopped so as not to
worsen unemployment&#8217;.</p>

<p>None of this could halt the PCF&#8217;s decline. When the Socialists
won the election in 1981, the party&#8217;s share of the poll fell to a
record low, 16.1 percent. Worse was to follow.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A downward spiral</h4>

<p class="fst"><strong>Marxism Today</strong>&#8217;s Stuart Hall reacted to Thatcher&#8217;s third
electoral victory in 1987 by announcing &#8216;If I&#8217;ve got a glimmer of
hope at the moment it&#8217;s the Italian Communist Party.&#8217; <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a></p>

<p>Yet it was hard to see the hope which glimmered from within the
PCI. Since the 19405 the PSI had been in the electoral shadow of the
PCI. In the wake of the historic compromise its fortunes seemed about
to be reversed. In the 1987 elections the PCI vote fell by another
3.3 percent to 26.6 percent. But the PSI&#8217;s rose by 2.9 percent to
14.3 percent. In 1976 the PCI got four times the PSI&#8217;s vote; in
1987 it polled only twice as much. In 1988 in a series of
administrative by-elections the PCI polled 22.8 percent to the PSI&#8217;s
18.1 percent (the PSI&#8217;s vote stood at 9.63 percent in 1972). The
PCI faced the prospect of the PSI repeating the achievements of Mitterrand.</p>

<p>In 1985 the PCI had called a referendum to defend the <em>scala
mobile</em> &#8211; the automatic pay rises which compensated for
inflation. The PSI-Christian Democrat government under the Socialist
Craxi was proposing its abolition. The Communists expected to win,
and so inflict a major blow on the PSI. In the event Craxi won by 3
million votes, carrying Milan, Turin and Genoa!</p>

<p>This result reflected the damage inflicted on the Italian working
class and the atrophy of the PCI. The PCI had been unable to mount an
effective strategy in the wake of the historic compromise. Until 1989
its slogan called for a vague &#8216;democratic alternative&#8217;. Meanwhile
in 1983 Craxi had broken the PSI&#8217;s alliance with the PCI in running
Milan, Turin, Rome, Naples and Venice. The PSI was set to re-join the
Christian Democrats in office. In 1987 it tried to show its ability
to govern by including in its slate the likes of the financier Guido
Rossi. Craxi and the PSI were benefitting from being in government
during an economic upturn.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs in which the PCI confronted the
developing crisis in Eastern Europe and Russia. At first the new
party leader Achille Ochetto hoped he could cash in on the Gorbachev
phenomenon. At its March 1989 congress Gorbachev addressed the PCI
from a giant screen.</p>

<p>Ochetto claimed the party was on a new course. The watchword was
now <em>riformismo forte</em>, tough reformism. In contrast the PSI was
said to represent weak reformism. On this basis the PCI offered a
pact to Craxi. <em>Riformismo forte</em> did not mean tough on the
capitalist class. Rather it meant bitter medicine for the Italian
working class. Ochetto stated, &#8216;We are going beyond the old guard
over whether there should be more market and less state. We are
changing the terms of the problem by saying there has to be a better
state and a better market.&#8217; <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a></p>

<p>Events in Eastern Europe produced even further movement. Three
days after the Berlin Wall came down Ochetto travelled to Bologna to
announce the need for the PCI to &#8216;reconstruct&#8217; and change its
name, dropping the label &#8216;Communist&#8217;. Eight months previously he
had opposed this action. The speech followed consultations between
Ochetto, Neil Kinnock of the British Labour Party and Willy Brandt of
the West German SDP. Interviewed by Eric Hobsbawm in <strong>Marxism
Today</strong>, Ochetto argued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We have had basically three stages: first, we were the
most critical component of the international communist movement;
second, we were in open disagreement, and third, we left the movement
and declared ourselves an integral part of the European left ...</p>

<p class="quote">I think there can be a broad coalition, including the
Democratic Christians, in a government committed to constitutional
change ... <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At a Congress in Bologna in March 1990 the PCI voted to drop the
word &#8216;Communist&#8217; from its title. The most prominent visitor was
Craxi of the PSI. The party also announced its application to join
the Socialist (or Second) International. To head off all of this
Craxi moved to adopt the name Socialist Unity Party.</p>

<p>These shifts do not seem to have halted the party&#8217;s decline. In
the May 1990 local elections its share of the vote had slipped 5
percent from comparable elections in 1985. The root cause of this
decline is the downturn in the fortunes of the Italian working class
since 1976 and the PCI&#8217;s response &#8211; to move ever rightwards.</p>

<p>Yet, if the PCI&#8217;s story in the 1980s was of slow decline, the
PCF seemed trapped in an alarming collapse, not knowing which way to
turn. In 1981, having campaigned hard against Mitterrand and the
Socialists, the party did an about turn and agreed to two of its
members joining his cabinet. Throughout this period it stayed silent
on Mitterrand&#8217;s austerity measures.</p>

<p>In 1984 it quit the government despite the opposition of its two
ministers. In 1986 its 9.7 percent vote equalled that of Jean Marie
Le Pen&#8217;s Nazi National Front. In 1988 the party polled only 6.76
percent, compared to the Front&#8217;s 14.38 percent.</p>

<p>Clinging to Stalinist rhetoric created new problems with the
arrival of Gorbachev. In December 1988 Marchais was forced to state
that perestroika stopped at the borders of the USSR! All this created
the most serious split in the PCF&#8217;s post-war history: an opposition
formed around Central Committee member Pierre Juquin &#8211; it raised
3,000 signatures in 1986 for a special party congress to examine the
PCF&#8217;s electoral collapse. Marchais denounced it as factional.</p>

<p>By 1988 Juquin along with a number of key figures in the local
leadership and in the CGT had left the party. In the presidential
elections of that year Juquin ran in opposition to the PCF. The
French Section of Ernest Mandel&#8217;s United Secretariat of the Fourth
International, the <em>Ligue Communiste R&#233;volutionnaire</em>, backed
Juquin, arguing: &#8216;The whole landscape is being shaken. The
possibility of building a revolutionary party in France is formulated
in new terms.&#8217; <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a></p>

<p>Juquin got 2.10 percent of the vote (the candidate of the LCR&#8217;s
rivals <em>Lutte Ouvri&#232;re</em> got 2 percent on a straight
revolutionary programme). Far from moving in a revolutionary
direction Juquin&#8217;s supporters split three ways. One group
(including Juquin) favoured joining the Greens, another preferred
standing for &#8216;Communist renovation&#8217;, and another saw the way
forward as claiming to be part of the &#8216;presidential majority&#8217;
(i.e. joining Mitterrand&#8217;s camp).</p>

<p>By 1990 there were whole areas of the country where the party had
ceased to function. This included the Doubs where the crucial Peugeot
plant at Sochaux is situated, employing 23,000 workers. Within the
CGT crucial officials are departing for the Socialist Party. The
party leader, Georges Marchais, was so associated with the Stalinist
rulers in Eastern Europe that the party&#8217;s fortunes must suffer
further. Confronted with the overthrow of Ceausescu, Marchais could
still talk in terms of the &#8216;globally positive balance sheet&#8217; of
the Stalinist regimes and of &#8216;problems of growth&#8217; in Romania
itself! Another veteran leader, Jacques Denis, lamented:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It is a fact that the class struggle is now unrolling in
a context that is more favourable to the capitalist forces ...
Recently I visited Berlin and there I witnessed its annexation to
capitalism ... NATO has advanced and the Warsaw Treaty is no more. I
am not in agreement with Novosti which says that German unity is a
triumph of justice ... I cannot understand how comrades persist in
looking at events through rose coloured spectacles. <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If the Italian party was suffering a fall in support and the PCF
from anorexia nervosa, the British party was awaiting burial. In May
1990 the CPGB&#8217;s weekly paper <strong>7 Days</strong> reported, &#8216;... the
Communist Party of Great Britain decided to cease production of <strong>7
Days</strong> ... orders and subscriptions [are] now under 3,700 ...&#8217; A
month later the <strong>Independent</strong> reported:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Communist Party of Great Britain yesterday took the
first formal steps towards following the example of its Eastern
European counterparts by ditching the dreaded word &#8216;communist&#8217;
from its title.</p>

<p class="quote">One insider said: &#8216;With the options now before us, I

<p class="fst">In autumn 1990 the threat of war in the Gulf as the US and Western
forces lined up against Iraq produced further evidence of the
evolution of the Western CPs away from even formal identification
with opposition to imperialism. In Italy the PCI divided into three
currents. The right wing around Giorgio Napolitana aims at entering a
broad centre-left European coalition. The centre, around party
secretary Achille Ochetto and the current leadership, is a few steps
behind on the rightward march. An alliance of old conservatives has
formed around the figure most traditionally associated with Moscow,
Armando Cossutt, ex-party leader Pietro Ingrao and the ex-leaders of
the far left PdUP, Lucio Magri and Luciana Castellina.</p>

<p>In the parliamentary debate on whether Italy should send warships
to the Gulf in support of the US the leadership abstained, having
backed United Nations intervention against Iraq. Ingrao denounced the
war drive but the left walked out of the chamber leaving the
government a free hand. In Britain the CPGB&#8217;s international
secretary, Chris Myant, attacked &#8216;knee-jerk pacifism&#8217; and argued
in support of Western intervention. In France the PCF has echoed
Gorbachev in denouncing Iraq but insisting on the United Nations flag
flying over any intervention.<br/>

<h4>The exceptions?</h4>

<p class="fst">Communist Parties in two countries seemed to offer an exception to
the pattern of decline. One was the Chilean CP, the other the South
African CP.</p>

<p>Before the military coup of 1973 the Communist Party of Chile
(CPC) regularly enjoyed between 15 and 20 percent of the popular
vote. As one observer notes the party was:</p>

<p class="quoteb">deeply committed to the norms and procedures of
capitalist democracy and to a broad alliance policy geared especially
to &#8216;progressive&#8217; sectors of Christian Democracy-so much so that
it was ideologically and organisationally ill-equipped to confront
the bloody military coup and its aftermath. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thousands of party members were killed, tortured or jailed after
the coup. Over time a new &#8216;internal&#8217; leadership emerged which
began to look towards a political and military strategy against the
Pinochet dictatorship. Nineteen eighty-three saw the revival of mass
opposition to the Pinochet dictatorship on the streets of Santiago De
Chile. The Communist Party was central to the rebirth of resistance.</p>

<p>The Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front began an armed struggle in
1983 which, three years later, almost succeeded in assassinating
General Pinochet. The old, exiled leadership had to bow to the
Patriotic Front. Throughout the world Chile held a dear place in the
hearts of Communists, and now the Communist Party seemed set to
topple the butchers of 1973. The Chilean party offered a beacon of hope.</p>

<p>But the underlying strategy of the party had not changed. In 1986
came an abrupt switch. The attempt on Pinochet&#8217;s life had led the
centre-right opposition coalition to break all links with the CPC and
the organisations of popular resistance. These divisions plus a
series of crackdowns in the shanty towns led to a decline in the
protests. The old leadership and the old strategy reasserted themselves.</p>

<p>Corvalan was interviewed by the Chilean magazine <strong>ASPI</strong> and
stressed the need for dialogue with the armed forces. He recalled the
experience of Popular Unity:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Let me tell you something. At the moment of Salvador
Allende&#8217;s victory, in the very tense days between his election and
his inauguration, we Communists made contact with top officers of the
armed forces. Modesty aside, I can say that we helped establish a
certain understanding between them and the new president regarding
some problems.</p>

<p class="quote">In that period, we had many meetings with the generals
... They learned to know us on many levels ... many of them learned
to know us and to respect us for our successes and our honesty.</p>

<p class="fst">That interview was followed by the dropping of a boycott of
Pinochet&#8217;s 1980 electoral process; the party urged supporters to
register to vote.</p>

<p>On her return from exile in 1988 Volodya Teitelbaum was asked by
<strong>El Pais</strong> about the experience of Popular Unity. She replied:</p>

<p class="quoteb">One sector of the UP, mixing up the stages, decided to
speed through them quickly to socialism. This was not possible in
Chile at that time, and I believe that it even helped nourish right
wing propaganda.</p>

<p class="fst">The Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front was now denounced. The party
backed the Democratic Coordination under Patricio Aylwin, a Christian
Democrat who had backed the 1973 coup. The CP agreed not to formally
join the alliance so as not to alienate the military. In December
1989 Aylwin won the election to succeed Pinochet as president.
Pinochet himself was allowed to stay on as head of the armed forces.
His security council oversees the return to democracy. Guarantees of
no reprisals against military officers were made and the army was
even allowed to maintain control 15 percent of the economy. In
October 1990 it was reported:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Mass defections and criticisms of its inflexibility are
continuing to cause major problems for the Chilean Communist Party
... Chile&#8217;s return to democracy in March, combined with the death
of Communism in Eastern Europe, has fanned internal dissent. As the
CPC debates its future there is strong disagreement over democratic
centralism and over the party&#8217;s support for &#8216;popular rebellion&#8217;
and the Patriotic Manuel Rodriguez Front guerrilla movement.</p>

<p class="quote">Recently 488 party activists signed a petition
criticising the central committee&#8217;s &#8216;repressive attitude &#8217;
afier the &#8216;removal&#8217; of critics from the CC. Leading CP
intellectual Luis Guastavino has challenged the CPC leadership to
stop inciting confrontation and paramilitary activity and to promote
discussion about a clear political project to replace empty rhetoric
about revolution. <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The party seems to be tearing itself apart as growing
demoralisation seizes the country. Guastavino&#8217;s move rightwards has
been countered by a strong show of support for the Patriotic Front,
against the wishes of the CPC leadership.</p>

<p>&#8216;In most places, communism has waxed and waned ... Not in South
Africa ... Whenever the black, green and gold flag of the African
National Congress (ANC) [appears] the Red Flag follows nowadays&#8217;,
reported the <strong>Economist</strong> on 28 October 1989. By March 1990 the
South African Communist Party (SACP) was legalised, along with the
ANC. It mushroomed in size.</p>

<p>Following the explosion of mass resistance by black workers in
1984 SACP had provided an inspiration for those Communists who
yearned for an old, hard Stalinist party, loyal to Moscow. Above all,
whilst everywhere else Communism was in retreat, in South Africa it
was visibly popular amongst the Black population. In the summer of
1986 at the height of the township uprisings SACP was confident
enough to publish an article entitled <em>The Beginnings of Peoples
Power</em>. It argued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The time will soon come, if it has not come already, when
we shall have to measure the level of development of our revolution
no longer by the number of strike days the workers have had per year,
nor by the number of military battles we have waged during any given
period, but instead by the number of peoples communes we shall have
helped organise in both town and countryside, building them on the
ruins of apartheid structures.</p>

<p class="quote">Our immediate task is to provide administration for our
newly liberated districts ... peoples communes aim at seizing control
of every facet of life in their district. Schools, rent offices,
clinics, sports stadiums, beerhalls and other such state owned
infrastructures as exist in the townships should be transferred into
the hands of the community, so that these services will cease to
operate under the aegis of the apartheid state.</p>

<p class="fst">It was a radical vista. Yet socialism was still not considered to
be on the agenda. In its 1962 programme <strong>The Road to South African
Freedom</strong> SACP had argued that what existed in the country was
&#8216;colonialism of a special type&#8217;, that two societies existed
superimposed on each other, one an exploiter white imperialist
nation, the other a black colonised nation. The SACP&#8217;s aim, through
the agency of the ANC, was a &#8216;democratic state&#8217;. Regarding the
black population it held &#8216;there are no acute or antagonistic class
divisions at present among the African people&#8217;. Joe Slovo, SACP
general secretary, was clear on the nature of the &#8216;democratic
state&#8217;. In December 1986 he told <strong>Marxism Today</strong>: &#8216;I believe
there will be a mixed economy in the post-liberation period, in which
in particular the black middle class and small black bourgeoisie will
come into their own.&#8217; <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a></p>

<p>This stress on separating the fight against apartheid from that
for socialism meant much of SACP&#8217;s propaganda was aimed at
&#8216;workerists&#8217;, particularly in the new black trade union
federation, COSATU. They rejected cross class alliances and talked of
fighting for socialism. Thus the SACP magazine <strong>Umsebenzi</strong>
argued in late 1987, &#8216;We must therefore take guard against
premature attempts to formally incorporate the objectives of
socialism into programmes of trade unions ...&#8217;</p>

<p>All of this was accompanied by a language and a stress on
attacking evidence of Trotskyism which was a throwback to the days of
Stalin. In 1986, for instance, Joe Slovo turned on left wing critics
who argued socialism was on the agenda, saying, &#8216;It can only be an
indigenous representative of the disastrous Pol Pot philosophy.&#8217;</p>

<p>The high hopes of &#8216;peoples power&#8217; were dashed during the state
of emergency imposed by President Botha in 1986. The South African
Defence Forces moved to successfully crush the township resistance
and the guerrillas of the ANC were incapable of launching a serious
armed struggle.</p>

<p>In 1989 the Seventh Congress of SACP adopted a new programme, <strong>The
Path to Power</strong>. It rejected the previous insurrectionary
perspective. Instead it argued, &#8216;<em>Armed struggle cannot be
counterposed with dialogue, negotiation and justifiable compromises,
as if they were mutually exclusive</em>&#8217; (original emphasis). The
needs of the South African regime brought the possibility of a
negotiated settlement with the release of Nelson Mandela in March
1990 and the opening of negotiations with the ANC.</p>

<p>The crisis in Eastern Europe did not bypass the SACP. Earlier this
year Joe Slovo was forced to publish a pamphlet entitled <strong>Has
Socialism Failed?</strong> &#8211; by socialism he meant what had existed in
the Stalinist states. Breaking with years of party rhetoric he
denounced &#8216;Stalinism &#8211; socialism without democracy&#8217;, rejected
the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat and condemned &#8216;the
over-centralised and commandist economies of the socialist world&#8217;
which created what he termed &#8216;socialist alienation&#8217;.</p>

<p>At the time of Mandela&#8217;s release the SACP seemed set to go from
success to success. But already problems are starting to re-emerge.
One is the continuing crisis in the USSR itself. One consequence of
this crisis is that the Gorbachev leadership, in its search for
detente with Washington, is keen to resolve regional &#8216;difficulties&#8217;
like South Africa and Chile. Both Communist Parties were closely
linked to Moscow while in exile. In part the shifts outlined above
were initiated by the Russians.</p>

<p>The other area of difficulty is that the quest for a negotiated
settlement has led to a further extension of the stages theory. In
<strong>New Era</strong> magazine, produced in the Cape and closely linked to
SACP, Tony Karon argued, &#8216;the immediate phase of our own struggle
is not for a national democratic state. It is for the creation of
democratic conditions in which the political contest can continue&#8217;.
<a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a> Karon was previously known for his defence of the <em>Freedom
Charter</em> as an instrument for achieving socialism. Now any
expectations being raised by the release of Mandela were being
shattered by supporters of <em>the</em> organisation still identified
in popular eyes with socialism and the working class.</p>

<p>This shift towards a new realism has, tragically, been accompanied
by the collapse towards the SACP of some of its hardest critics
within the trade unions. That was summed up by the decision of the
leader of the metal workers&#8217; union, Moses Mayekiso, to join SACP.
In the mid-1980s the union had been at the centre of a network of
anti-Stalinist worker militants and intellectuals. In 1985, when the
SACP was talking of popular power and the mobilisations were at their
height, this network was deeply suspicious of the SACP, the ANC and
their stages theory. They in turn were labelled &#8216;workerists&#8217; by
the SACP. These militants have now dropped their previous positions.
They are entering the SACP on its terms, using the argument that it
is a &#8216;broad party&#8217;.</p>

<p>This shift has been accompanied by a growing bureaucratisation of
the crucial Black trade union federation, COSATU, and attempts of the
South African regime to co-opt the union leadership. A debate on the
&#8216;Soviet experience&#8217; has led to a rejection of revolution. Alex
Erwin of the metal workers&#8217; leadership, previously a key
intellectual for the &#8216;workerists&#8217;, moved first, initially
supporting a mixed economy with a degree of workers&#8217; control or
self-management and then arguing the case for the industrial
efficiency of the South African economy and co-operation with the
employers and state.</p>

<p>It is no longer just a question of the ANC/SACP alliance lowering
expectations. The lack of focus for struggle has allowed the regime
to use the right wing forces of Inkatha to attack ANC supporters in
the townships. In a classic trick of counter-insurgency the regime is
capitalising on a period of confusion and passivity following a
period of prolonged struggle to try and confuse and derail the opposition.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p class="fst">For six decades revolutionaries have had to confront the existence
of mass Stalinist parties in the West. Stalinism was the product of
defeat, of the defeat of the Russian Revolution and the success of
Stalin&#8217;s counter-revolution, of the defeat of the revolutionary
wave which passed over Europe following the First World War and of
the defeat of the Chinese Revolution of 1927. These defeats in turn
helped isolate revolutionary Russia and so created the conditions in
which Stalin could strangle the revolution.</p>

<p>The existence of these mass Stalinist parties cannot be separated
from the existence of the state capitalist regime in the USSR. But
for revolutionaries it is vital to separate the Communist Parties of
the East from those of the West. The Communist Parties in Eastern
Europe, Russia, China and the other state capitalist countries are,
or were, the parties of the ruling class, of the enterprise managers,
the secret chiefs and tire army generals. No doubt the heads of the
Western parties aspired to such positions, but they were excluded
from the ruling hierarchies in the West precisely because their first
loyalty was, or was perceived to be, to Moscow.</p>

<p>But rank and file CP members were some of the best elements of the
working class &#8211; fighters from the shipyards of Glasgow, the docks
of San Francisco and Sydney, the Renault and Fiat car plants. And to
be a Communist in the 1940s and 1950s meant to be ridiculed or
witch-hunted and, in a dictatorship like Spain, to risk death. It was
for similar reasons that Trotsky distinguished between Western and
Eastern CPs even after members of the Mexican Communist Party had
tried to assassinate him! In discussions with American Trotskyists in
June 1940 he pointed out:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Of course the Stalinists are a legitimate part of the
workers&#8217; movement. That it is abused by its leaders for specific
GPU ends is one thing, for Kremlin ends another. It is not at all
different from other opposition labour bureaucracies. The powerful
interests of Moscow influence the Third International, but it is not
different in principle ... the political current of Stalinism is a
current in the workers&#8217; movement.</p>

<p class="quote">In France the Stalinists show great courage against the
government. They are still inspired by October. They are a selection
of revolutionary elements, abused by Moscow, but honest.</p>

<p class="quote">We can &#8217;t let the antipathies of our moral feelings
sway us. Even the assailants on Trotsky&#8217;s house had great courage.
I think we can hope to win these workers who began as a
crystallisation of October. We see them negatively; how to break
through this obstacle. We must set the base against the top. The
Moscow gang we consider gangsters but the rank and file don&#8217;t feel
themselves to be gangsters, but revolutionists. <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky died at the hands of a Stalinist assassin. He believed
neither Stalin&#8217;s regime nor the mass Stalinist parties would
survive the war. He predicted World War Two would end with a global
revolutionary upsurge. In this last prediction he was not far wrong,
as we have seen. But we know that Stalin&#8217;s Russia emerged from the
war more powerful and that, far from collapsing, state capitalism was
consolidated in Eastern Europe. We described too how the Communist
Parties were able to strangle the revolutionary movement of the
masses in 1944 and 1945.</p>

<p>That circumstance created a massive problem for the Trotskyists.
The arguments about the nature of Stalin&#8217;s Russia, and what was
termed the &#8216;buffer zone&#8217; in Eastern Europe, influenced their
attitude to the Western Communist Parties. After much hesitation the
post-war leaders of the Fourth International, Michel Pablo and Ernest
Mandel, coined the phrase &#8216;deformed workers&#8217; states&#8217; to
describe the Stalinist states of Eastern Europe &#8211; capitalism had
been overthrown not by the self activity of the working class, but by
the Red Army. This discovery ripped the core from Marx&#8217;s thinking &#8211;
that the emancipation of the working class was the act of the working
class itself.</p>

<p>From that it flowed that, far from being counter-revolutionary as
Trotsky had argued, Stalinism had carried through the revolution,
however qualified. Faced with the onset of the Cold War the
Trotskyists therefore saw a world where two camps based on different
classes faced each other. Ultimately they accepted Washington&#8217;s and
Moscow&#8217;s view of the world. Since the threat of a third world war
loomed, Pablo and Mandel argued, the Stalinist states would be forced
to unleash the Stalinist parties on the Western bourgeoisie. The
perspective was one of &#8216;war-revolution&#8217;. The political
consequences for revolutionaries were spelt out by Ernest Mandel
(writing as Ernest Germain):</p>

<p class="quoteb">The possibility of the outstripping of the Communist
Parties by their own mass base which in action can go beyond the
objectives set by the Kremlin and escape from its control ... placed
in certain exceptional conditions, entire Communist Parties can
modify their political line and lead the struggle of the masses up to
the conquest of power ...</p>

<p class="quote">The growing pressure of the masses is liable to force the
French and Italian Communist Parties to modify their pacifist course
of &#8216;neutralising&#8217; the bourgeoisie. These parties could then ...
project a revolutionary orientation and see themselves forced to
undertake a struggle for power ... <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The job of Trotskyists, then, was to join these parties and help
this process. The whole mission of Trotsky, to create a revolutionary
organisation independent of the Stalinists and the reformists, should
logically have been thrown out of the window. Yet the same Ernest
Mandel and his followers under different circumstances were capable
of falling into Stalinophobia. This later attitude chimed with the
feelings of many of the revolutionaries of the 1970s who were
influenced by Maoist ideas. For them Communist Parties were simply
&#8216;revisionist&#8217; and would be automatically swept away as workers
grew in militancy.</p>

<p>Some believed Russia was &#8216;social fascist&#8217; and that the Western
Communist Parties were &#8216;social fascist&#8217; too. This fitted
Beijing&#8217;s world view which, in the 1970s, saw Moscow as the main
enemy. Taking the logic of this argument to its extreme one Maoist
group in Portugal, the MRPP, organised attacks on Communist Party
offices as part of the witch-hunt in Northern Portugal in the summer
of 1975.</p>

<p>When workers did not spontaneously break from their traditional
parties and the struggle began to wane many of these organisations,
whose leaders had broken from the CPs over &#8216;revisionism&#8217;, began
to see the possible electoral success of the CPS as a way forward.</p>

<p>This was especially true in Italy. In 1976 the PdUP began to see
its role as being &#8216;the motor to 25 million legs&#8217;, in other words,
as a ginger group on the PCI. <em>Democrazia Proletaria</em> offered
the perspective of &#8216;a left government&#8217; which would comprise
itself, the PCI and PSI. This would) &#8216;open the revolutionary road&#8217;.
The failure of the PCI to beat the Christian Democrats and the
experience of the historic compromise helped demoralise thousands of
Italian revolutionaries and led to the collapse of their
organisations. When the PCI dropped the label Communist, <em>Democrazia
Proletaria</em> seemed set to take up that title and aim for a
realignment with the traditionalist wing of the PCI.</p>

<p>Similarly Mandel&#8217;s supporters in France, the LCR, placed the
emphasis of their propaganda, following the collapse of the Union of
the Left in 1977, on the need for a joint electoral pact between the
PCI and Mitterrand&#8217;s Socialists. Whilst this was not incorrect in
itself, the weight placed on the need for such unity was such that
the impression created was that this was <em>the</em> way forward for
the French working class. Little effort was made to point to the
record of successive reformist governments and the need to create a
revolutionary alternative.</p>

<p>Mandel seems to have believed that the development of
Eurocommunism opened up a new pool in which his Fourth International
could fish. <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a> Yet by 1978 the struggle was entering a downturn.
Across Europe and in North America the working class was on the
defensive. The evolution towards Eurocommunism did not carry with it
any gains for the working class, as Mandel had hoped.</p>

<p>In contrast the Socialist Workers Party in Britain, faced with a
small Communist Party with significant working class roots, adopted a
radically different approach. It spent much of the 1970s proposing
joint activities to the Communist Party. On the basis of this united
front approach it was able to win an audience amongst workers
influenced by CP ideas and was able to build successful mobilisations
over racism and unemployment. This did not mean dropping
revolutionary politics: this approach was accompanied by constant
attacks on the CP&#8217;s support for the parliamentary road and the
Social Contract and the Communist Party&#8217;s role in Chile and Portugal.</p>

<p>In those few countries like South Africa where the Communist Party
remains a force this is the only approach revolutionaries can follow.
Today the collapse of Stalinism is creating a vacuum on the left
internationally. It is a vacuum which can be filled by
revolutionaries, but only on the basis of clarity of ideas. That is
one lesson we can draw from the failings of much of the revolutionary
left in the late 1970s.</p>
