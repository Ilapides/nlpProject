<strong>James P. Cannon and the Origins of the American Revolutionary Left 1890&#8211;1928</strong><br/>
<em>University of Illinois, 2007, &#163;29</em></p>

<p class="fst">For me the decisive moment in James P. Cannon&#8217;s life was when he
gave up his swivel chair.</p>

<p>In 1928 Cannon turned his back on a career as a Communist Party
leader in the United States, facing inevitable expulsion by coming
out in support of Leon Trotsky and the left opposition to Stalinism.
As Joseph Stalin began to exert complete control over both Russia and
the Communist International, Cannon must have been a prime candidate
to be installed as leader of the US party. Stalin liked his general
secretaries to be staunchly proletarian and devotedly loyal. Maurice
Thorez in France, Ernest Th√§lmann in Germany and, on a smaller
stage, Harry Pollitt in Britain all fitted that mould.</p>

<p>Cannon was a &#8220;native&#8221; radical, born and brought up in harsh
industrial conditions in Kansas and with a track record as a
frontline organiser for the Industrial Workers of the World (known as
the Wobblies) and a key figure in the creation of the US Communist
Party. By 1928 Stalin was moving to axe Jay Lovestone as general
secretary because he was aligned with the Russian leader&#8217;s rival
Nikolai Bukharin. Stalin was also distrustful of another contender
for the post, the trade union leader William Z Foster.</p>
<p>Looking back Cannon explained why he chose to surrender the
relative comfort of party office &#8211; a decision made all the more
honourable because he knew he was heading into obscurity (though he
could not possibly be aware just how isolated he would be over the
following six years):</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The footloose Wobbly rebel that I used to be had
imperceptibly begun to fit comfortably into a swivel chair,
protecting himself in his seat by small manoeuvres and evasions, and
even permitting himself a certain conceit about his adroit
accommodation to this shabby game. I saw myself for the first time
then as another person, as a revolutionist who was on the road to
becoming a bureaucrat. The image was hideous, and I turned away from
it in disgust.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I never deceived myself for a moment about the most
probable consequences of my decision to support Trotsky in the summer
of 1928. I knew it was going to cost me my head and also my swivel
chair, but I thought: What the hell &#8211; better men than I have risked
their heads and their swivel chairs for truth and justice.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This does not quite do justice to his growing unease with the
degeneration of the Russian Revolution and the Communist
International. That probably dates from Moscow&#8217;s directive to
British Communists to uncritically tail the trade union leaders
during the 1926 general strike.</p>

<p>At the sixth congress of the Communist International, held in
1928, Cannon went to Moscow representing the faction he led within
the US party. As the lesser force to Lovestone and Foster&#8217;s
groupings he was sidelined by being sent to the commission
considering a new programme to be adopted by the International.</p>
<p>Cannon was unexpectedly handed an English translation of <strong>The
Draft Programme of the Communist International: A Criticism of
Fundamentals</strong> (now available as <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1928/3rd/index.htm" target="new"><strong>The Third International After Lenin</strong></a>), by the Bolshevik leader
Leon Trotsky, who had been expelled from the Soviet Communist Party
and was in exile in Alma Ata. The document was a searing attack on
Stalin&#8217;s notion of &#8220;socialism in one country&#8221; and an appeal for
the International&#8217;s policy to be based on the primacy of
international revolution over Soviet diplomatic interests. Trotsky&#8217;s
document was smuggled out, apparently stuffed into a teddy bear
belonging to an offspring of one of Cannon&#8217;s pals.</p>

<p>On his return to the US Cannon won over his partner, Rose Krasner,
his young factional supporters, Max Shachtman and Martin Abern in New
York City, Albert Glotzer and Arne Swabeck in Chicago, and then a
group of worker militants in Minneapolis. They formed the nucleus of
the most stable international grouping that rallied to Trotsky.</p>

<p>Cannon and his allies spun out the disciplinary proceedings
against them, increasing their audience, before dramatically
declaring their support for Trotsky. Within 24 hours of their
expulsion, copies of their declaration were circulating in the party.
Within a week they had launched a new paper, <strong>The Militant</strong>, its
first edition headlined: <em>For The Russian Revolution</em>.</p>

<p>Bryan D. Palmer&#8217;s book pays tribute to Cannon&#8217;s courage, but
it does much more than that. It is a serious study of the US left in
the decade before and after the First World War.</p>
<p>James Patrick Cannon was born in 1890 to parents of Irish origin
who had immigrated to the US and pitched up in Rosedale, Kansas, just
as the town&#8217;s good times ended. By the age of 12 he was working in
a meat packing plant, having been denied a secondary education. When
a high school was opened in Rosedale he went back to secure an
education.</p>

<p>Cannon&#8217;s political involvement began at the age of 14 when he
got involved in the defence of Big Bill Haywood, who was being framed
on murder charges for his role in a miners&#8217; strike. At 18 Cannon
joined the Socialist Party, attracted by its presidential candidate,
Eugene Debs. The party had 100,000 members and Debs polled just short
of a million votes in 1912. But Debs refused to get involved in inner
party matters, allowing cautious reformists to dominate the party.
Cannon reacted to this by joining the Industrial Workers of the World
in 1910. Palmer&#8217;s account of this period is the most gripping part
of the book.</p>

<p>Starting in Kansas City, Cannon and his comrades would go into
working class areas, particularly where itinerant workers, &#8220;hoboes&#8221;,
teemed. Competing against Christians, the sellers of fake medicinal
cures and so on, the Wobblies had to draw a crowd and hold them.
Cannon was a great soapbox agitator. Later he recalled, &#8220;You are
either a soapboxer or you are not. You are tested by whether you hold
the crowd, by the literature sold, and the money given to the collection.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the 1912 congress of the Wobblies, Cannon caught the eye of the
union&#8217;s general secretary, Vincent St John. In February 1913 &#8220;The
Saint&#8221; pitched Cannon into a labour uprising in Akron, Ohio, where
23,000 workers were employed in the tyre industry.</p>

<p>A strike at the Firestone plant sparked a walkout across the
city&#8217;s plants. The Wobblies threw every organiser and agitator at
the uprising. Eclipsed by the silk weavers&#8217; uprising in Paterson,
New Jersey &#8211; which attracted the help of John Reed, Elizabeth
Gurley Flynn and Big Bill Haywood &#8211; Akron was a dispute uniting
American and foreign born workers, men and women. In a sense it was
more representative of the US proletariat at the time.</p>

<p>The Wobblies held meetings and issued leaflets in English,
Serbian, German, Slovak, Italian and Hungarian, holding mass pickets,
parades, street corner meetings and strike rallies. At the beginning
the dispute had a carnival atmosphere, but this was not to last.
Armed police and specially recruited &#8220;deputies&#8221; &#8211; in reality
anti-strike vigilantes &#8211; were unleashed on strikers. Street
fighting lasted a week but the forces of &#8220;order&#8221; emerged on top.
The official American Federation of Labour (AFL) chipped in,
denouncing the strike. The numbers attending strike mobilisations
fell away and a drift back to work began before the AFL brokered a
return to work. The Wobblies had little permanent organisation on the
ground. Their itinerant organisers and agitators were brilliant when
a strike was on the up, but found it difficult to hold the line when
things went into reverse, and far more so to build anything from defeat.</p>

<p>By the time the First World War broke out in Europe, Cannon was
back in Kansas City, married with two children and attempting to earn
a living. But in 1917 two events brought him back into the struggle &#8211;
US entry into the war and the Russian Revolution. Reading John Reed&#8217;s
<strong>The Liberator</strong> and other pro-Bolshevik journals, Cannon was won
to the idea of a new combat party, firm on principles but rooted in
the class.</p>

<p>Like Reed he rallied to the pro-Bolshevik left wing of the
Socialist Party, travelling to that party&#8217;s 1919 congress in New
York City. The events there are portrayed well in Warren Beatty&#8217;s
film <em>Reds</em>. The leadership used every procedural trick to
defeat the left, eventually calling the police to evict them. In the
process the left split, with one grouping based on the foreign
language sections of the party leaving to proclaim itself the
Communist Party, while Reed&#8217;s supporters wanted to fight to the
last in the Socialist Party to try to secure the largest possible
support. Eventually two Communist Parties formed.</p>

<p>A post-war strike wave and the fear of revolution led to a
ferocious witch-hunt with strikes suppressed, mass arrests and
deportation of leftists. The revolutionary left was forced
underground (and the Wobblies were effectively destroyed).</p>

<p>The largely foreign language Communist Party argued that
clandestine organisation was a matter of Bolshevik principle. Cannon,
by contrast, realised revolutionaries had to seize any opportunity
for open, legal work in order to get mass support.</p>
<p>From 1920&#8211;3 Cannon campaigned for Communist unity and for open
work. The matter was settled at the Communist International&#8217;s
fourth congress where the Russians Gregory Zinoviev and Nikolai
Bukharin supported those championing clandestinity. In Moscow Cannon
secured an interview with Trotsky who, together with Lenin, ridiculed
the &#8220;champions of the underground&#8221;.</p>

<p>On paper Cannon should have become party leader. He cheered
Zinoviev&#8217;s campaign to &#8220;Bolshevise&#8221; the Communist Parties,
though this amounted to greater bureaucratic control from Moscow.
Then disaster struck when a Comintern emissary Joseph Pepper
succeeded in installing himself as effective party leader, promoting
Jay Lovestone within the party leadership.</p>

<p>Whatever his doubts about the growing demonisation of Trotsky,
Cannon was formally a loyal supporter of the Communist International
until his final trip to Moscow, agreeing to suppress references to
Trotsky and Zinoviev (after he became an opponent of Stalin) in the
party press. This is important because some on the left, echoing Max
Shachtman after his break with Cannon, have tried to rubbish him as a
bureaucrat, while others have tried to paint him as an immaculate Trotskyist.</p>

<p>The former charge does not stand up to Cannon&#8217;s commitment to
revolution, which lasted until his death in 1974. The latter charge
ignores the fact that Trotsky made tactical mistakes in his fight
with Stalin in the 1920s, and few in the international movement were
in a position to understand the importance of that fight.</p>
<p>Palmer ends this volume with Cannon&#8217;s expulsion and the creation
of the grouping that would subsequently become the Communist League
of America and then the US Socialist Workers Party. A further volume
is planned on Cannon&#8217;s subsequent role in the Trotskyist movement.
On the basis of this volume&#8217;s conclusion I somehow feel this will
not be as satisfactory.</p>

<p>For a generation of Trotskyists Cannon&#8217;s book detailing the
1939&#8211;40 faction fight with Shachtman, Abern, Glotzer and James
Burnham, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/cannon/works/1940/party/index.htm" target="new"><strong>The
Struggle for the Proletarian Party</strong></a>, became a sort of manual
on how to conduct an internal faction fight. Unfortunately, it was a
fairly disastrous manual. The dispute centred on matters of deep
substance such as the class nature of Stalin&#8217;s Russia and Burnham&#8217;s
rejection of historical materialism. But factional quarrels had been
almost continuous throughout the 1930s, meaning that from start to
finish the fight was between two camps rigid in their loyalties.</p>

<p>Trotsky urged Cannon on, but was also critical of his refusal to
try to generalise the discussion. By taking the discussion to a
higher plane, educating all concerned and creating space for a change
of views, Cannon could have avoided the retreat into two armed camps.</p>

<p>The other problem with <strong>The Struggle for the Proletarian Party</strong>
was that it labelled the Shachtman-Abern faction a &#8220;petty bourgeois
opposition&#8221;. Cannon would subsequently portray all faction fights
within the party as a clash between a proletarian centre and alien
class forces. That implies matters can only be resolved by a split.</p>

<p>Cannon&#8217;s problems were compounded after the Second World War.
Trotsky had predicted that the Soviet Union, which he still saw as a
degenerated workers&#8217; state, would not survive the war, which would
end with recession and revolution. Cannon clung to this perspective
even as Western capitalism entered its greatest ever economic boom,
and Stalinism expanded into Eastern Europe and China. Arguing that
the Eastern European regimes were somehow workers&#8217; states led to
the notion that capitalism could be overthrown by Russian tanks,
rather than the self-emancipation of the working class.</p>

<p>On the domestic front Cannon and his allies tended to retreat into
a more propagandist approach following the Second World War,
stressing the centrality of &#8220;the programme&#8221; in an increasingly
sterile and lifeless manner. He finally ceased to direct the day to
day running of the US Socialist Workers Party in 1953, at the height
of the McCarthyite witch-hunts.</p>

<p>But whatever criticisms are made of Cannon, he remained a link to
the glory days of the US left &#8211; the days of John Reed, Vincent St
John, Big Bill Haywood, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Eugene Debs and the
Wobblies. He represented an authentic, &#8220;native&#8221; leftism &#8211; the
idea, which goes against the grain of much of the left, that US
workers can be won to socialism and revolution. This book is a
fitting tribute to Cannon &#8211; soapboxer, Wobbly and American Bolshevik.</p>
