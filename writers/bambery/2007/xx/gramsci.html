<p class="fst">Lenin, Leon Trotsky, the young Soviet Republic and the Communist
International saw Russia&#8217;s October Revolution as the prelude to a
European revolution. Their hope and attention were focused primarily
on Germany, but also on Italy. In April 1920 Giacinto Serrati, the
dominant figure in the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), told the French
revolutionary Alfred Rosmer:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The towns and countryside are with us; the workers follow
our calls. The peasants are no less keen: in many rural communes, the
mayors have replaced the portraits of the king in the town halls with
pictures of Lenin. We have the strength; we have it so absolutely
that no one, friend or foe, would think of disputing it. The only
problem for us is how to use that strength. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The PSI was the only social democratic party in Western Europe to
oppose the First World War and played a key role in organising the
Zimmerwald Conference, held in September 1915 to rally the European
anti-war left. It was the first mass party to join the Communist
International &#8211; the international grouping of parties, usually
known as the Comintern, which supported the October Revolution. The
impact of the October Revolution was so great that every component of
the left and the trade unions felt it necessary to identify with it.
In the summer of 1920 they all journeyed to Moscow for the second
congress of the Comintern.</p>

<p>The Comintern was prepared to accept the PSI&#8217;s affiliation only
if it expelled its reformist wing. But Serrati, leader of the
dominant group in the party, sought to maintain the party&#8217;s unity
even though it was cracking open as the revolutionary crisis in Italy
developed. The other brooding presence in Moscow was the energetic
Neapolitan, Amadeo Bordiga. He wanted to create a &#8216;pure&#8217;
Communist Party, free of any hint of compromise. There was one
tendency not represented in Moscow &#8211; the grouping around the Turin
journal <strong>L&#8217;Ordine Nuovo</strong>, edited by Antonio Gramsci. To the
astonishment of the Italian delegates, Lenin delivered a speech that
berated Serrati for failing to drive out the party&#8217;s reformist wing
and creating a genuine Communist Party:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We must simply tell the Italian comrades that it is the
line of <strong>L&#8217;Ordine Nuovo</strong> members that corresponds to the line
of the Communist International, and not that of the present majority
of the Socialist Party&#8217;s leaders and their parliamentary group. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So little was known about Gramsci and his comrades that the
Comintern&#8217;s leaders had to ask Bordiga to explain their position &#8211;
which he did in an honest way after stating his disagreements with
them. Lenin&#8217;s praise for <strong>L&#8217;Ordine Nuovo</strong> was based on an
article setting out the need for a party capable of addressing the
revolutionary crisis engulfing Italy. Gramsci wrote it after the PSI
and the CGL union federation refused to act in support of a crucial
general strike in Turin. It carried an awesome warning for the future:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The present phase of the class struggle in Italy is the
phase that precedes either the conquest of political power on the
part of the revolutionary proletariat ... or a tremendous reaction on
the part of the propertied classes.</p>

<p class="fst">It castigated the PSI for its failure to act as a national force,
saying it operated simply as a &#8216;spectator&#8217; and &#8216;... continued
to be merely a parliamentary party, immobilising itself within the
narrow limits of bourgeois democracy&#8217;. The cure centred on creating
a party of a new type:</p>

<p class="quoteb">A cohesive and highly disciplined Communist Party with
factory, trade union and cooperative cells, that can coordinate and
centralise in its central executive committee the whole of the
proletariat&#8217;s revolutionary action, is the fundamental and
indispensable condition for attempting any experiment with soviets. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Gramsci was calling on the vanguard of the Italian working class,
the workers&#8217; delegates to the factory councils &#8211; in Turin in
particular &#8211; to form the basis for the leadership of a renewed PSI
or, if that could not be achieved, a new Communist Party. Gramsci
came late to this position &#8211; even as the second congress of the
Comintern was coming to a close, the Italian working class was
entering on its decisive confrontation, the occupation of the
factories in September 1920.</p>

<p>The great strength of <strong>L&#8217;Ordine Nuovo</strong> was that it focused
on building the factory councils as the basis of a new workers&#8217;
state. Despite their differences Serrati and Bordiga were united in
opposing the factory councils. For them the party laid the basis for
the new order, not factory councils. Throughout September 1920
Bordiga&#8217;s paper, <strong>Il Soviet</strong>, never mentioned the factory
occupations in its editorials. In the following month it published an
attack on Gramsci and other &#8216;heterodox&#8217; Communists who had
championed the councils.</p>

<p>Gramsci won Turin&#8217;s factory councils to the necessity of
revolution, but in Milan and elsewhere the leadership of the PSI and
the CGL dominated. A revolutionary party organised on a national
basis was needed. However, Gramsci only began organising to create
such a party after the revolutionary moment had passed.</p>
<p>Prior to that Gramsci identified with Lenin because he recognised
a common concern with the centrality of the Soviets or factory
councils. Alastair Davidson has argued that at the end of 1920
accounts of Lenin&#8217;s theory of the party were not clear or prevalent
enough to make Gramsci reconsider his belief that the Russian&#8217;s
main contribution was a theory of factory councils. But &#8216;Gramsci&#8217;s
own activity during that year&#8217; led him to favour &#8216;a renewal of
the PSI&#8217; and then &#8216;a split from the PSI and the formation of a
Communist Party&#8217;. It was when the traditional union and PSI leaders
in Turin attacked him, and not before, &#8216;that he was compelled to
embark on a critique, first of the unions, and then of the party&#8217;. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Hindsight is no comfort to revolutionaries. The end of the factory
occupations was followed by rising unemployment, victimisations and a
fascist counter-offensive. Gramsci was haunted by a sense of failure.
Looking back in 1924 he wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In 1919-20, we made extremely serious mistakes which
ultimately we are paying for today. For fear of being called upstarts
and careerists, we did not form a faction and organise this
throughout Italy. We were not ready to give the Turin factory
councils an autonomous directive centre, which could have exercised
an immense influence throughout the country, for fear of a split in
the unions and of being expelled prematurely from the Socialist Party
... The problem is ... that of relations between the central
leadership and the mass of the party, and between the party and the
classes of the working population. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This became a recurrent theme, which echoes strongly throughout
Gramsci&#8217;s <strong>Prison Notebooks</strong>.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The botched birth of Italian Communism</h4>

<p class="fst">Gramsci&#8217;s warning of a &#8216;terrible reaction&#8217; if the
revolutionary moment was missed was almost immediately fulfilled.
From November 1920 fascism went on the offensive, initially targeting
the agricultural labourers&#8217; unions of north east and central Italy.
During local elections held a month earlier, Socialists won
majorities in 2,162 out of 8,059 communes, and in 25 of 69 provinces.
They broke the control exercised by the landowners in central Italy,
who, in their rage, switched in ever greater numbers to the fascists.
The fascist offensive began in Bologna where they attacked the
Socialist council, beginning a series of such attacks on Socialist
local authorities. The lack of any coordinated resistance encouraged
them. By the close of 1921 the strength of the fascist squads
approached 300,000. In the preceding 12 months they had destroyed 59
<em>case del popolo</em> Socialist centres, 119 <em>camere del lavoro</em>
union halls, 107 cooperatives, 83 peasant trade unions and 141 social
centres. They had left over 100 dead and thousands wounded, forcing
councillors out of office and leftists and trade unionists to flee
for safety. The attacks were not just on the left, but even on the
most moderate Socialists and on rural cooperatives run by Catholics.
Any independent organisations which threatened the dominance of the
landowning elite were legitimate targets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the overall success of the PSI in the local elections
meant that they now ran important local authorities, which had
control of public works and could enforce a closed shop for the
agricultural labour unions. This strengthened the hand of those who
wanted to keep the party united, avoiding a break with the
reformists; Serrati was confident of securing a majority of votes at
the forthcoming party congress, although some of those in his own
Maximalist group were prepared to expel the reformists in order to
qualify for membership of the Comintern.</p>

<p>A Communist faction was created in October and November 1920,
supposedly aimed at uniting all those prepared to act on the
Comintern&#8217;s strategic advice. But the driving force in the faction
was Bordiga&#8217;s followers, who were keen to keep out the left wing of
the Maximalists. Lenin&#8217;s tactical advice, by contrast, was that the
forces of the left should unite with the party&#8217;s leadership to oust
the reformist right wing of the party; after all, the far left and
the Maximalists shared a common fidelity to the Comintern and were
fervent supporters of the Russian Revolution.</p>

<p>But things took a different turn in January 1921 at the PSI
congress in Livorno. The far left walked out to launch a new
Communist Party after securing 58,785 votes to Serrati&#8217;s 98,028 and
the right wing&#8217;s 14,695. The voting figures exaggerated the new
party&#8217;s strength. Three months later Gramsci estimated it had just
25,000 adherents. Bordiga was the architect of this botched birth,
while Gramsci paid for his isolation in Turin. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a>
He did not speak at the congress, was not elected to the Communist
Party&#8217;s leadership and was subject to abuse from all the factions
for his supposed support for Italy&#8217;s entry into the First World War
(a canard based on a confused youthful article). As Davidson points
out, &#8216;Gramsci helped to create the sort of party he did not want&#8217;.
<a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> It was formed too late to act at the
decisive revolutionary moment in autumn 1920. It was too small and
too sectarian to meet the danger now bearing down like a locomotive
on the Italian working class &#8211; fascism.</p>

<p>The confusion was assisted by something else. A section of the
Comintern leadership, acting independently of Lenin and Trotsky (who
were preoccupied with civil war raging in Russia), had adopted &#8216;the
theory of the offensive&#8217; &#8211; the notion that if the new Communist
Parties in Western Europe adopted a continual insurrectionary
approach they could spur the working class to make the revolution.
<a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> Two Comintern emissaries to the
Livorno congress &#8211; the Hungarian Mátyás Rákosi and the Bulgarian
Khristo Kabakchiev &#8211; backed Bordiga&#8217;s approach. In March 1921 the
German Communists, influenced by these ideas, launched an
insurrection. It was a disaster, leaving 4,000 Communists in jail and
halving the party&#8217;s membership of 350,000. Lenin and Trotsky led a
full-scale attack on such adventurism, on the &#8216;theory of offensive&#8217;
in general and on the &#8216;left&#8217; Communists at the third congress of
the Comintern later that year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the failure of the Italian Communists to galvanise a
fighting United Front of resistance to fascism was one for which the
Italian working class and peasantry would pay a high price &#8211; as
would Gramsci. The entire left and working class movement was in
retreat. In 1920 the PSI had 216,000 members. A year later the
combined membership of the PSI and Communist Party was just 100,000.
<a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> The membership of the CGL fell from
two million to one million. The retreat quickly became a rout in the
face of mounting unemployment. In spring 1921 Fiat suddenly
threatened to sack 1,500 of its 13,000 workers. When the internal
commissions moved to oppose this, the company demanded they dissolve
themselves, declared a lockout and rushed in troops to occupy its
plants. The workers held out for three weeks before agreeing to
Fiat&#8217;s terms. The factory councils were finished. As the lockout
ended, a fascist &#8216;punitive expedition&#8217; burnt down the <em>casa
del popolo</em>. It was their first significant action in Turin.</p>

<p>No faction of the Italian left could offer a practical response to
the fascist terror. The reformists and the CGL union asked workers to
turn the other cheek, and even signed a truce with fascist leader
Benito Mussolini (the truce remained a dead letter). The Maximalists
intensified their rhetoric about revolution, acting as if it were
still on the immediate agenda, while the Communists retreated into
splendid isolation. All three groups turned in on themselves, in
denial about the victory nearing Mussolini&#8217;s grasp. The new
Communist Party turned its back on another piece of advice from Lenin
that Gramsci later recalled:</p>

<p class="quoteb">He told comrade Serrati: &#8216;Separate yourselves from
Turati [the leading reformist], and then make an alliance with him.&#8217;
This formula should have been adapted by us after the split ...
though continuing the ideological and organisational struggle ... we
should have sought to make an alliance against reaction. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Gramsci denies his instinct</h4>

<p class="fst">Gramsci was isolated even in Turin as the group around <strong>L&#8217;Ordine
Nuovo</strong> disintegrated. Gramsci&#8217;s closest collaborator, Palmiro
Togliatti, now sided with Bordiga. Gramsci slumped into nervous
exhaustion and a breakdown. Yet what is striking about Gramsci&#8217;s
writings in 1921 and 1922 is that his instinct was almost always
correct, but ultimately he always fell in behind Bordiga&#8217;s line.</p>

<p>This was shown over the question of the <em>arditi del popolo</em>.
These were groups made up of socialist, republican, anarchist,
revolutionary syndicalist and Catholic activists. They aimed to fight
off fascist attacks. They had close connections with the working
class &#8211; for example, in Rome they received donations from builders,
railway workers and post workers. They successfully prevented fascist
squads attacking the working class areas of Livorno, Civitavecchia,
Sarzana, Arezzo, Ferrara and Parma. On 9 November 1921 fascist bands
from Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany arrived in Rome for a national
fascist congress intent on carrying out another punitive expedition.
The <em>arditi del popolo</em> organised to counter them. The battle
lasted five days and left seven dead and 200 wounded. The fascists
were forced to beat a humiliating retreat from their national
conference, burning the theatre they had met in.</p>

<p>Gramsci&#8217;s <strong>L&#8217;Ordine Nuovo</strong> had printed a supportive
interview with Argo Secondari, a key figure in the formation of the
new anti-fascist movement. Three days later the paper ran a piece by
Gramsci himself in which he wrote, &#8216;Are the communists opposed to
the <em>arditi del popolo</em> movement? On the contrary: they want
the arming of the proletariat, the creation of an armed proletarian
force.&#8217; <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> Gramsci went on to argue:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In each home in which working class families live, groups
of proletarian defence should be formed in which able workers of all
parties should participate. Each group, linking with the groups of
neighbouring homes, should become an element of the neighbourhood
unit ... The <em>arditi del popolo</em> could effectively coordinate
the workers&#8217; squads, organising them in groups at pre-established
points in every neighbourhood to intervene, in case of need ... <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Three days later the paper published an appeal for the creation of
a single anti-fascist defence force. Turin&#8217;s Communists were
involved with Socialists, anarchists and a range of the city&#8217;s
working class organisations in creating a united <em>arditi del
popolo</em> group. But the Communist Party leadership issued a
circular instructing party members they could only belong to a
defence force that was under party control and calling for members to
quit the <em>arditi del popolo</em>. Later the leadership under
Bordiga went further and denounced the <em>arditi del popolo</em>.
Gramsci accepted this line. He not only bowed to the line of the
leadership, but repeated the claptrap that fascism was just another
form of bourgeois reaction, whose time in power would be brief, and
that if fascism destroyed parliamentary democracy this would benefit
the left because it would destroy illusions in parliamentary change.
Yet he understood that fascism represented a mortal danger to the
Italian working class. Later, in 1932, Trotsky recalled that Gramsci
was the only Italian Communist who saw the possibility of a fascist victory.</p>

<p>In October 1921, as fascist violence intensified, the CGL
announced it was forming an alliance of labour (<em>alleanza del
lavoro</em>) with the smaller anarchist and syndicalist union
federations, as well the rail workers&#8217; and seafarers&#8217; unions, to<p>
fight the fascist onslaught. Gramsci&#8217;s initial response was to
welcome this as a step forward, which the Communists could develop at
grassroots level. Once again, however, he accepted the leadership&#8217;s
rejection of any such alliance. Later Gramsci explained that he
wished to avoid a split with Bordiga. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a>
Of all the Italian leftists, Gramsci was the nearest to Leninism in
theory, but he lacked Lenin&#8217;s single-minded determination and his
readiness to take a minority position in the party if necessary.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The Comintern and the debate on revolutionary strategy</h4>

<p class="fst">Gramsci escaped his political purgatory when he was appointed as
the Italian Communist Party&#8217;s representative to the Comintern
executive committee in Moscow. He left for Russia in May 1922. The
stress of acting as a loyal party member while privately disagreeing
with Bordiga&#8217;s leadership had taken its toll. In Russia he suffered
a nervous breakdown. But his experiences in Russia enabled him to
mature as a revolutionary. Events in Italy also played no small part.</p>

<p>On 28 October 1922 Mussolini arrived in Rome by sleeper train to
be taken to the palace and appointed premier. Only then were the
fascist squads allowed to march past their leader and the king,
before being hurried on their way home. This was the reality of the
&#8216;March on Rome&#8217;. In truth the various fractions of the Italian
ruling class, the heads of the security forces and the king had
decided to accept Mussolini as prime minister in an effort to secure
stable government. As with Adolf Hitler 11 years later, Mussolini
initially headed a coalition government in which the fascists held a
minority of cabinet positions. Like their German counterparts, the
Italian ruling class turned to fascism with distaste, believing they
could co-opt and neuter the upstart they had ushered to power.</p>

<p>The Italian working class was far weaker than the German working
class &#8211; yet it offered far more spontaneous resistance to fascism.
It was badly served by its parties. Days before Mussolini&#8217;s
appointment Bordiga had penned a circular to party branches denying
that fascism could triumph. Palmiro Togliatti, who was allied with
Bordiga in the party&#8217;s leadership at the time, later admitted:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Right up to the eve of the March on Rome, and even while
it was taking place, the Communist Party was denying the possibility
and the actuality of the coup d&#8217;etat. Immediately after the march
on Rome the party&#8217;s theoretical journal published an article which
maintained that the advent of Mussolini to power would not
substantially change the country&#8217;s political situation. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The reality of fascism must have hit home to the exiled Gramsci
when, three days before Christmas 1922, fascist squads attacked the
capital of the Italian workers&#8217; movement &#8211; Turin. The offices of
<strong>L&#8217;Ordine Nuovo</strong> were sacked and 12 workers were killed. A
fascist bomb exploded in the CGL offices, killing 20 workers. Gramsci
grasped that fascism was not simply another form of reaction and that
its violence would go far beyond normal means of state repression &#8211;
destroying all forms of working class organisation and any body
independent of the state.</p>

<p>Despite his illness Gramsci was able to participate in the fourth
congress of the Comintern, held in November 1922, which centred on a
continuing debate about the need to win a majority among Western
European workers through the policy of the United Front. Powerful
Communist Parties now existed in some Western European countries, but
in none did they enjoy the allegiance of a majority of the working
class. That honour remained with the reformist parties. Only by
struggling alongside the reformists in defensive struggles could the
revolutionaries break that hold. The term &#8216;hegemony&#8217; was employed
to explain the domination of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat
through the latter&#8217;s acceptance of the division between economics
and politics:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The bourgeoisie always seeks to separate politics from
economics, because it understands very well that if it succeeds in
keeping the working class within a corporative framework no serious
danger can threaten its hegemony. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There was still opposition from many &#8216;left&#8217; Communists who
believed that the revolutionary offensive should be continued at all
times as the way to waken the working class and break it from
reformism. Almost simultaneously Trotsky, as head of the Red Army,
was countering those who argued that revolutionary military strategy
depended on a permanent offensive theory &#8211; a war of manoeuvre.
Trotsky argued that all wars require a combination of offence and
defence &#8211; in other words of manoeuvre and position. Gramsci would
have been familiar with these arguments among the leaders of the Red Army.</p>

<p>In Italy the fledgling Communist Party was the primary target of
fascist violence and repression. By early 1923 its membership had
slumped to around 5,000. Adopting the United Front strategy was now a
matter of life and death for a party desperately isolated in the face
of massive repression.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Rearming the Communist Party</h4>

<p class="fst">Victor Serge provides a vivid pen portrait of Gramsci when both
were living in Vienna working for the Comintern, in late 1923:</p>

<p class="quoteb">An industrious and Bohemian exile, late to bed and late to rise ... His head was heavy, his brow
high and broad, his lips thin; the whole was carried on a puny,
square-shouldered, weak-chested, humpbacked body. There was grace in
the movement of his fine, lanky hands. Gramsci fitted awkwardly into
the humdrum of day to day existence, losing his way at night in
familiar streets, taking the wrong train; indifferent to the comfort
of his lodgings and the quality of his meals; but, intellectually, he
was absolutely alive. Trained intuitively in the dialectic, quick to
uncover falsehood and transfix it with the sting of irony, he viewed
the world with exceptional clarity.</p>

<p class="fst">Serge explains Gramsci&#8217;s desire to return to fascist Italy:</p>

<p class="quoteb">When the crisis in Russia began to worsen, Gramsci did
not want to be broken in the process, so he had himself sent back to
Italy by his party; he who was identifiable at the first glance
because of his deformity and his great forehead. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Italy&#8217;s fascist rulers were unlikely to have forgotten Gramsci.
In a speech in December 1921, Mussolini had attacked a certain
&#8216;Sardinian hunchback and professor of economics and philosophy&#8217;
who had &#8216;an unquestionable powerful brain&#8217;. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p>From Vienna Gramsci began organising to win the leadership of the
Italian Communist Party from Bordiga, who had been arrested and
jailed. The first step was to win the support of his old comrades
from <strong>L&#8217;Ordine Nuovo</strong> &#8211; Togliatti and Umberto Terracini. In
April 1923 Bordiga smuggled out a document which was fiercely
critical of the Comintern leadership, which he asked other party
leaders to sign. Gramsci refused, although Togliatti urged him to
sign. This sparked a debate among the old <strong>L&#8217;Ordine Nuovo</strong>
comrades. Gramsci wrote to Togliatti, arguing in favour of adopting a
United Front approach:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Three years experience has taught us, not just in Italy,
how deeply-rooted social democratic traditions are, and how difficult
it is to destroy the residues of the past simply through ideological
polemics. An immense and at the same time painstaking political
action is necessary, that can break down this tradition day by day,
by breaking down the organism which embodies it. The tactics of the
International are adequate for this purpose. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In another letter Gramsci argued that Bordiga mirrored the
reformist Second International in preventing individual initiative
and leaving party members passively waiting on the party&#8217;s
leadership, encouraging the idea that the party&#8217;s strength and very
existence itself would determine the possibility of revolution: &#8216;The
party has not been seen as the result of a dialectical process, in
which the spontaneous movement of the revolutionary masses and the
organising and directing will of the centre converge&#8217;. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a>
He continued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In central and western Europe the development of
capitalism has not only determined the formation of the broad
proletarian strata, but also &#8211; and as a consequence &#8211; has created
the higher stratum, the labour aristocracy, with its appendages in
the trade union bureaucracy and the social democratic groups ... This
makes the action of the masses slower and more prudent, and therefore
requires of the revolutionary party a strategy and tactics altogether
more complex and long-term than those which were necessary for the
Bolsheviks in the period between March and November 1917. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">By March 1924 Togliatti and Terracini had swung behind Gramsci and
the Comintern intervened to impose a new executive committee of the
Italian party, including Gramsci. Bordiga and his key supporter
resigned from the executive. Gramsci pushed through the creation of a
cell structure, with factory groups, which better suited the new
political situation (and held out the future possibility of
initiating factory councils) and, in February 1924, the launch of a
daily newspaper, <strong>L&#8217;Unit&#224;</strong>. Gramsci suggested the title and
insisted it should involve the supporters of the Comintern expelled
from the PSI. He himself edited a new fortnightly <strong>L&#8217;Ordine
Nuovo</strong>. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a> He stressed a degree of continuity:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The specific aims of the review, in my opinion, should
still be the factory and the organisations of the factory ... We
should seek to reconstruct among ourselves an environment like that
of 1919&#8211;20 with the means we have at our disposal. Then, no
initiative was taken if it had not been tested against the reality,
if first we had not probed the opinion of the workers about it in
various ways. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In May 1924 Gramsci finally returned home to Italy after his
election to the chamber of deputies gave him parliamentary immunity
from arrest.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The search for the United Front</h4>

<p class="fst">The reorientation of the party came just as Mussolini&#8217;s regime
was thrust into a crisis that threatened its continued rule. On 10
June 1924 the Socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti was kidnapped on the
streets of central Rome after a speech in parliament denouncing
electoral fraud and then found murdered. The kidnappers were
identified as a fascist squad operating under Mussolini&#8217;s control.
The reaction to the assassination took Mussolini by surprise:
&#8216;Spontaneous demonstrations in favour of the opposition broke out
in the streets, which was something that had not been seen for a long
time.&#8217; <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a> Mussolini&#8217;s attempted
to crush the protests by calling out the fascist militia. But, as
Gramsci wrote, &#8216;The first attempt to mobilise the national minority
failed utterly, with only 20 percent answering the call; in Rome only
800 militiamen presented themselves at the barracks.&#8217; <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a>
This failure meant that between 14 June and 16 June the anti-Fascists
had a chance to control the streets.</p>

<p>The liberals, republicans and Socialists quit parliament in
protest, collecting together in an alternative assembly on Rome&#8217;s
Aventine Hill. Gramsci and the other Communist deputies joined them,
arguing that they should call a general strike and hold
demonstrations. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a> An anti-fascist living in Rome recalled the
atmosphere &#8211; and the paralysis which infected the opposition:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We went almost every night to a restaurant ... with the
leaders of the Socialist Party ... For a week or ten days there was
no sign of the fascists on the streets of Rome. It was known that the
people of Trastevere, all republicans, were ready to march with their
clubs and revolvers. They only awaited the orders of the Aventine
opposition ... But no one wanted to give the order. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Aventine leaders hoped they could appeal to the king to
dismiss Mussolini. But as Mussolini played for time, the fascist
squads rallied to him and the king reaffirmed his support for the
regime. By the end of 1924 Mussolini was able to unleash the fascist
squads again, this time targeting liberal and bourgeois opponents of
fascism as well as the left, and establishing a far tougher
dictatorship. Looking back Gramsci argued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">If the Mussolini government had fallen, whatever the
means which had caused it to fall, an extremely deep political crisis
would have opened up in Italy, whose development no one could have
foreseen or halted. But the opposition forces too knew this, and they
therefore excluded right from the beginning &#8216;one&#8217; way of bringing
fascism down, the only possible way, the mobilisation and struggle of
the masses. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Eventually Gramsci led the Communist deputies back into the
chamber, seeking to use it as a platform for their views.</p>

<p>The efforts to create an effective anti-fascist United Front
brought into the open the battle with Bordiga inside the party.
Gramsci debated with Bordiga in Naples. Here Gramsci argued the
necessity for &#8216;every member of the party&#8217; to be &#8216;an active
political element, a leader&#8217;. That required them, &#8216;each in his
own milieu&#8217;, being &#8216;made capable of orienting themselves, of
knowing how to derive from reality the elements needed to establish a
policy&#8217; so that &#8216;the working class will not lose courage but feel
it has leaders and is still able to fight ... Precisely because the
party is strongly centralised, a vast amount of propaganda and
agitation among its ranks is required. It is necessary for the party
in an organised fashion to educate its members and raise their
ideological level.&#8217; <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p>The party now experienced substantial growth, with 27,000 members
by the end of 1925. The fascist secret police reported that the
Communists had survived repression better than any of the other left
parties &#8211; not only &#8216;maintaining ties with the masses but ...
semi-clandestine, it had also partly salvaged the essential structure
of its organisation&#8217;. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a> This was
in part due to Gramsci&#8217;s insistence on a cell structure, rather
than Bordiga&#8217;s preferred geographical branches. The factory groups
in particular found it easier to hold together.</p>

<p>Gramsci now worked on theses for the party congress due to be held
early in 1926 in the safety of Lyon, France. The &#8216;Lyon theses&#8217;
argued that the party had not capitalised on the factory occupations
or intervened to attempt to stop fascism&#8217;s victory in October 1922:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The defeat of the revolutionary proletariat in this
decisive period was due to political, organisational, tactical and
strategic deficiencies of the workers&#8217; party ... the proletariat
did not succeed in placing itself at the head of the insurrection of
the great majority of the population, and channelling it towards the
creation of a workers&#8217; state ... The victory of fascism in 1922
must be seen, therefore, not as a victory won over the revolution,
but as a consequence of the defeat suffered by the revolutionary
forces through their own intrinsic weakness. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Gramsci offered his vision of a revolutionary party:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The principle that the party leads the working class must
not be interpreted in a mechanical manner ... The capacity to lead
the class is related, not to the fact that the party &#8216;proclaims&#8217;
itself its revolutionary organ, but to the fact that it &#8216;really&#8217;
succeeds, as a part of the working class, in linking itself with all
the sections of that class and impressing upon the masses a movement
in the desired direction and favoured by objective conditions. Only
as a result of its activity among the masses will the party get the
latter to recognise it as &#8216;their&#8217; party (winning a majority); and
only when this condition has been realised, can it ... draw the
working class behind it. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Leadership required the party taking up immediate or partial struggles:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Communist Party links every immediate demand to a
revolutionary objective; makes use of every partial struggle to teach
the masses the need for general action and for insurrection against
the reactionary rule of capital ... In every case, the party utilises
the experience of the movement in question, and of the outcome of its
own proposals, to increase its influence &#8211; demonstrating through
facts that its action programme is the only one which corresponds to
the interests of the masses and to the objective situation &#8211; and to
transport a backward section of the working class on to a more
advanced position. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The stress on the United Front does not stop Gramsci from
continuing to define the ultimate tasks of the Communist Party as:</p>

<p class="quoteb">(a) to organise and unify the industrial and rural
proletariat for the revolution; (b) to organise and mobilise around
the proletariat all the forces necessary for the victory of the
revolution and the foundation of the workers&#8217; state; (c) to place
before the proletariat and its allies the problem of insurrection
against the bourgeois state and of the struggle for proletarian
dictatorship, and to guide them politically and materially towards
their solution, through a series of partial struggles. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The vote at the Lyon congress reflected Gramsci&#8217;s rearming and
rebuilding of the party &#8211; he secured 90.08 percent of the vote.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The road to Calvary</h4>

<p class="fst">Gramsci had little time left in freedom after the success of the
Lyon Congress. In autumn 1926 Mussolini stripped deputies of their
parliamentary immunity and Gramsci was arrested on 8 November after
being forced by the fascist police to abort a meeting with a
Comintern representative. His Calvary at the hands of Mussolini
lasted from then until his death. The abortive meeting was to have
been with Jules Humbert-Droz. He had been charged with persuading
Gramsci to support Joseph Stalin and his ally at the time, Nicolai
Bukharin, in their campaign against the Joint Opposition within the
Russian party led by Trotsky, Gregory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev.
Gramsci was not a supporter of the Joint Opposition. But in October
1926 he had written to the leadership of the Soviet party stating
that this factional campaign was doing great damage at home and
abroad and should be halted. Togliatti, representing the Italian
party in Moscow, refused to pass on the letter, though he did read it
out to Bukharin. Gramsci responded angrily to Togliatti. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a>
The stage was set for a more serious break with Moscow and with
Togliatti. In 1929 Stalin declared that the world had entered a new
&#8216;third period&#8217; in which insurrection was on the cards virtually
everywhere and in which the social democrats would help the
bourgeoisie turn towards fascism. According to Stalin, the social
democrats&#8217; &#8216;social fascist&#8217; character ruled out any United
Front with them. Togliatti, under pressure from a pro-Stalin young
guard in the party, agreed that Italy too was on the verge of a
revolutionary crisis. Activists were dispatched across the Alps to
stimulate mass work &#8211; in reality returning to arrest and
Mussolini&#8217;s jails.</p>

<p>Gramsci refused to endorse such lunacy. He had fought hard for the
United Front policy against fascism, the strategy now being denounced
by Stalin and Togliatti. He challenged the idea that the mass of
Italian workers was breaking with reformism, and that the country was
approaching a revolutionary situation that would sweep fascism away
and install the dictatorship of the proletariat. Instead he pressed
for united action with the Socialists and other anti-fascists, and
for the raising of a demand for a constituent assembly. He believed
that if fascism fell, as a result of the global recession that
followed the 1929 Wall Street Crash, for instance, the strongest
likelihood was this would be followed by a period of parliamentary
rule. In his prison writings he outlined his hopes that this might
allow for the reconstruction of the factory councils and that they
could prepare the way for a future insurrection. Interestingly, at
almost precisely the same time, in May 1930, Trotsky was engaged in a
correspondence with some of Bordiga&#8217;s sympathisers in the
International Left Opposition over their attempt to combine the
demand for a constituent assembly with a demand for workers&#8217; and
peasants&#8217; committees. Trotsky argued that if fascism fell it might
well be superseded by a period of democratic rule, rather than
socialist revolution, and argued that revolutionaries could raise
democratic demands and &#8216;invest them with the most audacious and
resolute character possible&#8217;. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a>
Gramsci&#8217;s argument led to attacks from fellow Communist prisoners,
who refused to talk to him, while Togliatti refused to let the wider
world know of his criticisms of the new policy.</p>

<p>Gramsci had entered prison a staunch revolutionary. His final
speech to the Italian parliament, where the small Communist group of
deputies faced Mussolini and the massed fascist ranks with
blackshirts guarding every exit, was brave and uncompromising:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We are sure that we represent ... the essential interests
of the majority of the Italian people. Proletarian violence is
therefore progressive and cannot be systematic. Your violence is
systematic and systematically arbitrary because you represent a
minority destined to disappear. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But Gramsci&#8217;s work as a mature revolutionary has been passed
over or bowdlerised by those keen to utilise his name. This process
started with the publication of his prison writings just after the
Second World War, when Togliatti portrayed Gramsci&#8217;s strategy as a
precursor for the Italian Communist Party&#8217;s decision to rebuild a
capitalist Italian republic in alliance with Christian Democracy. The
attempt to paint Gramsci as a figure who rejected insurrection and
presented an alternative to Leninism continued into the 1970s and
1980s with the Eurocommunists and into the 21st century with today&#8217;s
neo-Gramscians.</p>

<p>Gramsci&#8217;s <strong>Prison Notebooks</strong> can only be fully understood
as a continuation of his political fight to rebuild and rearm the
Italian Communist Party. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a> Above all
they are a sustained defence of the political strategy he championed
during those years and drew heavily on the debates in the Comintern
at its third and fourth congresses. Martin Clark points out that
&#8216;Gramsci in prison thought constantly about the &#8220;revolution that
failed&#8221; in 1919&#8211;20&#8217; and that the &#8216;analysis of why revolutions
fail is a major theme of the <strong>Prison Notebooks</strong>,&#8217; providing
&#8216;the stimulus&#8217; for his views on hegemony, political organisations
and parties, and intellectuals&#8217;. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p>One of the key sections of the <strong>Prison Notebooks</strong> contrasts
revolution in Russia and the East with revolution in the
parliamentary democracies of the West. It is not to belittle the
importance of the <strong>Prison Notebooks</strong> to point out that this was
hardly controversial within the Comintern. Lenin recognised that &#8216;in
Western Europe it will be much more difficult to begin the
proletarian revolution than in Russia. But it will be much easier to
continue and complete it.&#8217; Bordiga had argued at the Comintern&#8217;s
second congress for a policy of abstention from parliament and
parliamentary elections because conditions for making a revolution
were different in the West, where &#8216;bourgeois democracy has
functioned for many years and ... the revolutionary crisis will
consist simply of a direct transition from that political system to
the dictatorship of the proletariat ...&#8217; This &#8216;requires first
breaking out of the limits of bourgeois democracy and demonstrating
the deceitfulness of the bourgeoisie&#8217;s claim that every political
struggle should take place within the parliamentary machinery&#8217;.
<a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a> Accordingly, claimed Bordiga, the
experience of the Bolsheviks in the Duma (the assembly established
under the Tsar) had no application in the West. Lenin countered:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We are obliged to carry on a struggle within parliament
for the destruction of parliament ... Can one conceive of any other
institution that all classes participate in to the degree they do in
parliament? This cannot be created artificially. If all classes are
drawn into the parliamentary struggle, it is because class interests
and conflicts are reflected in parliament. If it were possible
everywhere and immediately to bring about, let us say, a decisive
general strike to overthrow capitalism at a single stroke, the
revolution would have taken place in a number of countries. But we
must reckon with the facts, and parliament is a scene of the class
struggle. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Perry Anderson&#8217;s 1976 article, <em>The Antinomies of Antonio
Gramsci</em>, written at a time when Anderson broadly identified with
Lenin and Trotsky, showed that it is impossible to understand
Gramsci&#8217;s prison writings outside the context of the debates in the
early Comintern:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The theory and practice of the Third International ...
had been saturated with emphasis on the historical necessity of
violence in the destruction and construction of states. The
dictatorship of the proletariat, after the armed overthrow of the
bourgeois state apparatus, was the touchstone ... Gramsci never
questioned these principles. On the contrary, when he started his
theoretical explanations in prison, he seems to have taken them so
much for granted that they scarcely ever figure. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But the fact that Gramsci took them for granted is no excuse for
neo-Gramscians pretending that he rejected them. The strategic stress
on the United Front and the issue of the relationship between party
and class were the dominant concerns of Gramsci in his years as an
active member of the Communist Party. They remained so in his prison
years and they resonate throughout the <strong>Prison Notebooks</strong>.</p>
