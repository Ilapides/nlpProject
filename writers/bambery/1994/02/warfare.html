<p class="fst"><strong>A History of Warfare</strong><br/>
John Keegan<br/>
<em>Hutchinson &#163;20</em></p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;War is hell.&#8217; So wrote General Sherman towards the end of his
life and he should have known. Sherman was one of the founders of
modern &#8216;total&#8217; warfare &#8211; war where the destruction of the
enemies&#8217; fighting soldiers is no longer sufficient as a goal but
where, in a modern industrialised society, victory rests on
destroying the enemy&#8217;s economy and the morale of its civilian
population. Sherman&#8217;s march to the sea and the destruction of the
Confederate state&#8217;s railroads, the cotton plantations on which its
society was based and the burning of cities like Atlanta, effectively
ended the American Civil War.</p>

<p>John Keegan&#8217;s <strong>A History of Warfare</strong> starts with the
Prussian theoretician von Clausewitz&#8217;s maxim that &#8216;war is the
continuation of policy by other means&#8217;. He goes on to paint a broad
historical sweep from Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt up to the Second
World War and Vietnam.</p>

<p>Keegan is no left-winger, having been a senior lecturer at
Sandhurst and going on to become defence editor of the <strong>Daily
Telegraph</strong>, getting an OBE in the Gulf War honours list. Yet he is
also no Colonel Blimp. As in his other books he does not shirk from
detailing what war entails at the cutting edge. The very breadth of
his study is stimulating and it makes for an easy read.</p>

<p>But it is also a book through which runs a debate Keegan has not
resolved. Its writing coincided with the ending of the Cold War and
the widespread acceptance that the great wars between continental
powers are a thing of the past. Keegan accepts that and goes on to
look for a role for the modern soldier.</p>

<p>His answer lies in a peacekeeping role round the globe&#8217;s
troublespots. The brutality of the American intervention in Somalia,
the inability of the West to prevent the eruption of wars which
stretch from Italy to China and the futility of the West&#8217;s Gulf War
all blow a wide hole in such hopes.</p>

<p>In an argument with Clausewitz, Keegan argues that war cannot be
identified with modern states or with power politics. Rather its
origins lie in human nature. &#8216;Man&#8217;, for Keegan, &#8216;is a thinking
animal in whom the intellect directs the urge to hunt and the ability
to kill&#8217;.</p>

<p>This is the most annoying part of the book. Humans have been on
the globe for some 1 million years while their antecedents were
around for two million years. The view that warfare emerged alongside
the creation of agricultural societies is one now accepted by not
just Marxists but most mainstream anthropologists. Yet Keegan&#8217;s
argument that the origins of war lie somewhere in our inner selves
rests on an examination of societies which were already developed,
like those of Ancient Mesopotamia, or tribes already in contact with
more developed societies. At the earliest his examples start some
6,000 years ago.</p>

<p>In carrying forward this critique of Clausewitz, Keegan goes on to argue:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Politics played no part in the conduct of the First
World War worth mentioning. The First World War was, on the contrary,
an extraordinary, a monstrous cultural aberration, the outcome of an
unwitting decision by Europeans in the century of Clausewitz ... to
turn Europe into a warrior society.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">This can only be maintained by an argument that contrasts the
century running up to the First World War with the rest of human
history where, he argues, war had nothing to do with politics but
emerged from particular military cultures.</p>

<p>But the First World War can only be understood through the
emergence of the great Western powers and their division of an
emerging world economy. The war itself ended with the explosion of
the class differences on which these states rested with revolution in
Russia and Germany.</p>

<p>Throughout his book, however, John Keegan goes out of his way to
show how warfare developed in relation to the development of
humanity&#8217;s productive capacity. This is the meat of the book and
makes its reading worthwhile.</p>
