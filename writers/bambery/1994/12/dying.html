<p class="fst"><b>Nor Meekly Serve My Time &#8211; The H Block Struggle 1976&#8211;1981</b><br/>
Brian Campbell, Laurence McKeown and Felim O&#8217;Hagan<br/>
<i>Beyond the Pale Publications &#163;9.95</i></p>

<p class="fst">The date will remain with me for ever. In the early hours of
Tuesday 5 May 1981 I was woken by the sound of dustbin lids being
beaten on the small streets off Belfast&#8217;s Falls Road. After a few
moments the realisation of what had happened sank in. Bobby Sands, MP
for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, had died on the 66th day of his
hunger strike. As the senior IRA officer in the H Blocks he had
volunteered to lead the second hunger strike demanding Republican
prisoners were given political status.</p>

<p>Over 100,000 people attended Bobby Sands&#8217; funeral two days
later. When he had won the Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat with
30,492 votes a few weeks before it had been a slap in the face to
Margaret Thatcher who had boasted that Sands and his fellow hunger
strikers had little or no support.</p>

<p>Throughout that spring and summer people took to the streets,
workplaces walked out on strike, two prisoners (one the hunger
striker Kieran Doherty) were elected to the Irish parliament, while
Sands&#8217; election agent Owen Carron held his parliamentary seat. None
of it was enough. Nine more would die.</p>

<p>Francis Hughes&#8217; funeral took place in the countryside. Going by
bus from Belfast meant running the gauntlet of Loyalist stone
throwers and having to march across fields when the RUC halted the
coaches. Martin Hurson died suddenly and shockingly after just 46
days. Joe McDonnell&#8217;s funeral procession was attacked by troops
with plastic bullets. Kieran Doherty died after an agonisingly long 73 days.</p>

<p>As the weeks dragged on there was more and more a sense of
powerlessness. If this was true on the outside it must have been a
hundred times more so inside the H Blocks. The prisoners knew
comrades and friends were dying just a few yards away in the hospital
block. This book tells of the hunger strike as they experienced it. I
cannot do it justice. Their words speak for themselves.</p>

<p>What remains with everyone active over the hunger strike is the
bitterness towards Britain&#8217;s political establishment. Margaret
Thatcher coldly watched ten men die while Labour&#8217;s Don Concannon
flew in to spend a few minutes with a dying Bobby Sands, tormenting
him with the information that Labour was backing Thatcher&#8217;s line.</p>

<p>These men and women &#8211; women in Armagh jail joined the first
hunger strike which was called off when the Tories seemed to offer
concessions which were withdrawn &#8211; were not acting on orders from
&#8216;the evil IRA godfathers&#8217; the British press bleated on about. The
leadership of the Republican movement argued against the hunger
strike. It was the prisoners who decided on this course of action.</p>

<p>In the end the hunger strike set its own deadline. Once Bobby
Sands and the other three original strikers had died it was difficult
to see how victory could be achieved.</p>

<p>The strike ended when relatives started insisting on medical
treatment when their sons slipped into comas. This must have been a
terrible decision. The relatives had been the ones who had begun the
protests when the first H Block Republican prisoners refused to wear
prison uniform or accept prison discipline. They had seen their sons
and husbands live for months and even years with only a blanket to
wear in an empty cell (a mattress was only thrown in at lights out)
and suffering beatings. They had gone through the worries of the
first hunger strike and the brief elation when it seemed to have
achieved a successful conclusion.</p>

<p>This book began as a pamphlet for the tenth anniversary of the
strike. It is a tribute, as are Bobby Sands&#8217; writings, to how
ordinary people can not only take everything the establishment throws
at them, but how in the process they blossom into fuller human beings.</p>
