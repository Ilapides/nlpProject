<p class="fst">As 1934 opened the fascists believed that their hour had come.
Hitler was consolidating his dictatorship in Germany. Fascism seemed
set to sweep the board in France and Austria.</p>

<p>The traditional party of the French middle class, the Radicals,
was losing its support. The various French fascist bands claimed a
membership of 1 million. A series of financial scandals involving
Radical Party ministers had rocked France. In January a Ukrainian
Jewish speculator, Stavisky, was found shot dead in an Alpine resort.
The common view was that he had been killed to stop him revealing
links with top politicians.</p>

<p>The fascists responded to the Stavisky affair with a mix of
anti-Semitism and denunciation of corrupt politicians. On 6 February
the various fascist bands called a demonstration outside the Chamber
of Deputies, and tried to force their way in. Marbles were thrown
under the hooves of police horses, fascists wielded canes with razors
attached, railings were torn up to be used as missiles and a bus was
set on fire. Not until the early hours were the rioters finally
dispersed. Fifteen people were killed and 1,435 wounded.</p>

<p>While all this was going on the Radical government had won a vote
of confidence. But the next day, fearing it could no longer maintain
order, it bowed to the fascist threat and resigned. A right wing
government of &#8216;order&#8217; took over. It presented itself as a bulwark
against fascism, but to most workers it seemed a step towards fascism.</p>

<p>The Communists and the Socialists were divided. But the main trade
union federation, the CGT, called a nationwide strike. The CGT was
led by right wingers but its leadership was under more direct
pressure from the rank and file than either the Socialist or
Communist leaderships.</p>

<p>No one knew how the strike call for 12 February would be met. The
French working class had suffered a series of defeats since the end
of the First World War. Union membership was low. The Communist Party
refused to back the day of action until the day before. The general
strike met with a huge response. In the Paris region alone a million
workers downed tools. In the capital there were two demonstrations,
one called by the Communists, the other by the CGT and the
Socialists, which converged on the Place de la Nation. The Socialist
leader, Leon Blum, recalled:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;I was marching in the front row. The gap between the
two columns narrowed from second to second and we all shared the same
anxiety; would the meeting of the two columns be a collision? Was
this <em>journ&#233;e</em> going to degenerate into a conflict between two
factions of the working class population of Paris ...?</p>

<p class="quote">&#8216;Now the two columns were face to face and from all
sides the same cry sprang up ... People shook hands. The heads of the
column melted into each other. This was not a collision but a
fraternisation. By a sort of popular groundswell the people&#8217;s will
had imposed unity of action of the working class&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">In the weeks following, the Socialist and Communist leaders
retreated into their old posturing. But at a rank and file level
Committees of Vigilance sprang up which mobilised against the
fascists. Within weeks the two parties had to enter into a &#8216;Unity
Pact&#8217; under pressure from below. The French fascists were thrown
back from the edge of power onto the defensive. Native French fascism
was never able to challenge for power. The working class began a
process of radicalisation which would explode in June 1936, with the
biggest general strike the world had yet seen and nationwide factory occupations.</p>

<p>Events in France were in strong contrast to those in Austria.
Rather than imposing a fascist dictatorship directly, the Austrian
chancellor Dolfuss aimed to chip away at the Socialists&#8217; power
base. In February 1934 he was confident enough to order the <em>Heimwehr</em>
(the fascist militia), the police and the army to &#8216;cleanse&#8217; the
working class areas of Vienna.</p>

<p>The working class districts of Vienna were ringed with artillery
and tanks. A three day battle began. But the Socialist Party ordered
that resistance should be left in the hands of a few thousand
<em>Schutzbund</em> (Socialist militia) members. As house to house
fighting went on there was the strange spectacle of the bulk of
Vienna&#8217;s workers left to watch the fighting as spectators, cheering
on their side! After three days of heavy fighting the <em>Schutzbund</em>
was overwhelmed. Some 2,000 workers were killed, over 5,000 were
wounded, while tens of thousands were jailed. The Socialist Party and
the trade unions were banned.</p>

<p>Yet the resistance of the Viennese workers was an inspiration to
workers across Europe. The slogan &#8216;Better to die in Vienna than
surrender in Berlin&#8217; served as a call to action, and nowhere more
than in an isolated mining region on the other side of Europe.</p>

<p>For seven years, from 1923 to 1930, Spain had been under the heel
of the military dictatorship of General Primo de Rivera. The
dictatorship collapsed amidst popular jubilation in 1930. A year
later the monarchy was swept away and a republic proclaimed. But the
carnival atmosphere soon gave way to a growing polarisation. After
years of repression the working class expected great things from this
republic. The country exploded in a strike wave led by the
revolutionary anarchist trade union federation, the CNT. In the
countryside landless labourers seized land. Within a year the CNT
reached its peak membership of 1,200,000.</p>

<p>In response, the Spanish upper classes increasingly looked to the
newly formed semi-fascist CEDA. The right wing won a victory in the
elections of November 1933, helped by the CNT&#8217;s boycott of the
poll. This new government began to crack down on the workers&#8217;
movement and invited CEDA to join it in office.</p>

<p>The Socialist Party underwent a sweeping radicalisation. Its timid
constitutionalism was replaced by openly revolutionary language. Its
leader, Largo Caballero, who had previously collaborated with the
dictator de Rivera, was now called the &#8216;Spanish Lenin&#8217;! Among the
party&#8217;s rank and file this new language had a powerful effect. The
Socialist Youth began to describe themselves openly as Marxists.</p>

<p>The Socialist Party joined the Workers&#8217; Alliance, a united front
which included the Communist Party and revolutionaries. This promised
that if CEDA joined the government it would organise a nationwide
insurrection. Caballero hoped that this threat would in itself be
enough to stop CEDA from taking office. Meanwhile the CNT refused to
join the alliance.</p>

<p>Only in one area, the mining region of Asturias in north west
Spain, was there true unity. Here the CNT joined the regional
Workers&#8217; Alliance which aimed to mobilise the workers against
fascism, not just to defend democracy but to make the revolution.
They argued this was the only way to defeat fascism.</p>

<p>On 4 October CEDA entered the government. The Socialist Party
leadership&#8217;s bluff had been called. Reluctantly it proclaimed a
general strike, which with no preparation was a failure everywhere
except Asturias. The miners had waited months for what they saw as
the day of the revolution. Hastily formed militias besieged the hated
paramilitary police Civil Guard posts. Local Workers&#8217; Alliance
committees rapidly took over the villages and towns, and organised
every aspect of local life from food and hospitals through transport
and communications to a makeshift war industry.</p>

<p>The miners had few arms but seized on dynamite from the mines to
defeat the civil guards. A thousand dynamiters were dispatched to the
regional capital, Oviedo. Here revolutionary power was established on
the streets. Prostitutes joined workers in bitter hand to hand
fighting with the government forces who were driven into a few
isolated strongholds. Such was the optimism of the workers of
Asturias that they dismissed news of the general strike&#8217;s failure
elsewhere as government lies.</p>

<p>The government sent troops under the command of General Franco to
crush the Asturias Commune. In the mountain approaches they faced
stiff resistance. Giant catapults rained down dynamite on them. When
the 20,000 strong Red Army ran out of explosives they fought with
rocks. But inevitably they were pushed back. On 18 October the
Commune surrendered. Franco&#8217;s troops entered the mining communities
leaving a trail of murder, rape and torture. Over 3,000 workers died
during the revolution and 30,000 were jailed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the heroism of the Asturian miners was not in vain.
They effectively stopped Spanish fascism from coming to power
constitutionally as Hitler had done in Germany. Above all the
uprising accelerated the radicalisation of the Spanish working class.
The left won a sweeping victory in the elections of February 1936,
and when in July Franco led the army in an uprising, the workers did
not hesitate to take to the streets, to arm themselves and to seize
the factories.</p>

<p>Across the Atlantic 1934 marked an even more dramatic reversal in
the fortunes of the working class. A mere 3 million American workers
were organised in trade unions before the Wall Street Crash of 1929.
Union organisation was confined to craft workers, whose leaders
argued that unskilled workers were &#8216;unorganisable&#8217;.</p>

<p>In the great steel, car and rubber plants non-unionised workers
could be fired at will. They faced a ten to 12 hour day and regular
speed up on the production lines. The level of fightback was low. In
the Great Depression unemployment topped 18 million. Over 3 million
workers were forced to take 10 percent wage cuts. More than a million
were homeless, on the road in search of work and food.</p>

<p>The leaders of the union federation, the AFL, were unconcerned
with their fate. In 1932 they even opposed federal unemployment
benefit! Trade union membership fell by 7,000 a week. In 1932
unemployed demonstrators in River Rouge were machine gunned. Four
protesters were killed. In Washington unemployed war veterans were
driven off the capital&#8217;s streets by cavalry.</p>

<p>Yet things were set to change. In 1933 Franklin D. Roosevelt was
elected president as the Democratic Party candidate. He had promised
change which he would not deliver but the vague talk of change
encouraged resistance. At the beginning of 1934 there was a brief
economic recovery. Unemployment fell by two million to &#8216;just&#8217; 14
million. The effect of this was dramatic, removing the threat of
redundancy and of the blacklist for many workers.</p>

<p>Three strikes &#8211; among Toledo auto component workers, San
Francisco dockers and Minneapolis teamsters (truckers) &#8211; all
unofficial, triggered a nationwide strike wave which swept the old
union leaders aside.</p>

<p>In Minneapolis a small group of Trotskyists had spent years
working among the truckers, organising the union. At the beginning of
1934 they were able to lead a strike of 600 coal shovellers to
victory. The effect of the strike in the city was dramatic and the
Trotskyists were able to spread the message that workers could fight
and win.</p>

<p>Within weeks all the teamsters walked out to secure union
recognition. The strike then spread to affect all the city&#8217;s
workers. The bosses caved in, only to renege on the deal having
ensured the state governor would mobilise the National Guard. The
second strike which followed remains a model for revolutionaries.
Cruising pickets went back on the streets. When they met with
opposition from the police they brought out other workers in
solidarity. Strikers&#8217; wives were mobilised as picket squads, as
were unemployed workers. Decisions were taken by mass meetings and an
elected strike committee.</p>

<p>The picture in Toledo and San Francisco was similar. In Toledo
socialists had organised an unemployed movement which allowed them to
win support among car workers which, when the strike broke, gave them
a position of leadership. In the San Francisco docks a group around
the Communist Party had launched a rank and file paper, the
<strong>Waterfront Worker</strong>. From a small beginning they were able to
build an all out dock strike.</p>

<p>Victory in all three strikes was gained by new methods. Each was
run by elected strike committees. When cops attacked pickets other
groups of workers struck in solidarity. Previously unorganised
workers showed great militancy. In Toledo 10,000 pickets defied a
court injunction, chased off the National Guard and then bombarded
scabs in the plant with rocks using giant catapults made from tyre
inner tubes!</p>

<p>Within two years of these strikes America was rocked by a new
strike wave which threw up another new tactic &#8211; factory
occupations. The leaders of the AFL were simply swept aside. A new
union federation, the CIO, was built among the unskilled.</p>

<p>The year 1934 was a year in which the fortunes of the working
class shifted dramatically. In the case of France, Spain and the
United States this shift was unexpected, stemming from rank and file
action. What mattered was that socialists could respond to that
shift. In the 1930s there were just handfuls of revolutionaries so
the main beneficiaries were the Communist Parties, which swelled in
size. Today, 60 years on, events are moving with the same urgency.</p>
