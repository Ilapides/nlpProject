<p class="fst"><strong>Britons: Forging the Nation 1707&#8211;1837</strong><br/>
Linda Colley<br/>
<em>Pimlico &#163;10</em></p>

<p class="fst">There is an advert on television for Typhoo tea featuring the
speech from Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>Richard II</em> which describes this
&#8216;sceptred isle&#8217;. It comes with the required image of a Britain
complete with cricket on the village green, scones and, of course,
tea. Yet there is a jarring note at the advert&#8217;s end. Shakespeare&#8217;s
speech is a triumph of praise for &#8216;this England&#8217;. In 1994 the
advertisers have scored out the name England and replaced it with Britain.</p>

<p>It is a reminder of just how recent the notion of a British nation
is. The mythology woven around the crown and the &#8216;mother of
parliaments&#8217; is that these are institutions rooted in the mists of
a common past. The truth is rather different. The idea of Britain as
a single nation state is little older than the creation of the United States.</p>

<p>Until the close of the 18th century anyone living in London would
have regarded all Scots, whether Gaelic or English speaking, as
aliens and would have found it difficult to communicate with the bulk
of the population elsewhere in England.</p>

<p>Linda Colley&#8217;s book is an excellent examination of how the
notion of a British state was born. For her it centres on war, and in
particular the long war with France in the 18th century. This war
would become the first world war, with European armies fighting in
North America and India and their navies engaged in battle off the
Australian coast.</p>

<p>The final victory of this long contest at Waterloo in 1815 marked
more than military success. Colley reproduces a painting by the
Scottish artist David Wilkie depicting news of victory over Napoleon
being brought to Chelsea pensioners. This painting was a top draw
when it was first exhibited. Within it are various images of Britain
&#8211; the pubs named after various military grandees, the piper from a
Highland regiment, Chelsea pensioners and even a black bandsman who
conjures up the idea of empire.</p>

<p>Yet just 50 years earlier the London mob rioted in support of John
Wilkes&#8217; claims that George III was promoting Scots to rule the
kingdom of England and that by their nature Scots were enemies of liberty.</p>

<p>Linda Colley is strongest at showing the various threads which
were sewn together to create the idea of the British nation. Unlike
many on the left she is absolutely clear that 18th century Britain
was a capitalist economy. The ruling oligarchy may have been
aristocrats but they were intimately connected to industry, commerce
and the slave trade.</p>

<p>Agriculture was increasingly geared to feeding the growing cities
and for export. The ruling class expanded beyond its earlier
oligarchical core and threw up cultural and political institutions
which extended down into the lower classes.</p>

<p>Unlike France, Britain&#8217;s wars did not centre on the geographical
expansion of its borders, but rather on the acquisition of ports and
colonies for commercial gain.</p>

<p>But the book falls down in trying to carry an argument against
E.P. Thompson and other Marxist historians who have demonstrated the
class polarisation of Britain in this period, the level of repression
and the rich culture of opposition to the ruling class. Colley
argues, however, the majority of Britons accepted the new British
nationalism and the ruling class which spawned it.</p>

<p>But there is a problem here when one tries to examine what is
often termed &#8216;the silent majority&#8217;. These are people who can
suddenly find themselves moving sharply in different directions. The
same people who might have cheered George III&#8217;s jubilee could turn
on his rakish successor. Those who sang of British liberty could
employ those ideas in an entirely different direction when it came to
demanding parliamentary reform. The London mob might riot for king
and country but they could also carry through near insurrection &#8211;
in what the history books call the Gordon Riots &#8211; against the
symbols of the ruling order.</p>

<p>In her chapter on the abolition of slavery, Colley simply looks at
those in the ruling class who came to support abolition. She misses
the popular protests which ensured black people were freed if they
set foot on British soil and that slavers could not recapture them.</p>
