<p class="fst">Thirty years ago thousands of American students, mostly from
comfortable white middle-class homes, gave up their summer vacations
to go South into Mississippi and other former slave states. They went
to challenge the racial segregation which equalled virtual apartheid.
Others went into the slums of the Northern industrial cities to build
community organisations and education projects.</p>

<p>The years 1964&#8211;65 were the high water mark of American
liberalism. President Lyndon B. Johnson got Congress to pass the
Civil Rights Bill and a year later the Voting Rights Act was made
law. Johnson announced a War On Poverty as part of a move towards
what he termed &#8216;the Great Society&#8217;.</p>

<p>The organisations which would spawn the New Left were at their
peak. The Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the
Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) were spearheading Freedom Summer
in Mississippi. Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) provided the
young idealistic students who went South and into the Northern slums.
The Free Speech Movement erupted at the University of California in
Berkeley over the administration&#8217;s ban on political meetings and
stalls. It ushered in a wave of campus unrest which burned for a decade.</p>

<p>What unfolded was a process of disillusionment with any hope of
reforming American society and a process of radicalisation. The young
blacks at the centre of SNCC and CORE would move away from the ideas
of non-violence and Martin Luther King towards the revolutionary
ideas of Black Power and the Black Panthers. SDS would explode in a
debate involving tens of thousands of young people who were groping
towards revolutionary politics.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 1960s the assumption was that the civil
rights movement could herald a new coalition between liberals and the
trade union movement which would either create an equivalent to
Britain&#8217;s Labour Party or transform the existing Democratic Party.
Trade union leaders like Walter Reuther of the United Automobile
Workers helped fund the activities of SDS, CORE and SNCC and threw
their efforts behind Martin Luther King. Thousands of rank and file
workers joined King&#8217;s March on Washington. The demonstrators&#8217;
songs illustrated the link between the trade unions and the civil
rights movement. Thousands joined in revised versions of <em>Which
Side Are You On</em> and <em>Hallelujah I&#8217;m A Bum</em> (changed to
<em>Hallelujah I&#8217;m a Travellin&#8217;</em>). Even <em>Freedom Train a
Comin&#8217;</em> was adapted from <em>Union Train a Comin&#8217;</em>!</p>

<p>In September 1963 hundreds of members of the United Packinghouse
Workers came to Washington to meet with civil rights leaders. CORE
leader James Farmer led them in a song discovered by left wing folk
singers on a picket line in the 1940s, <em>We Shall Overcome</em>.</p>

<p>Later more than 60 members of the teaching union (more than half
from New York City) went to Mississippi to teach black youngsters
during Freedom Summer. In San Francisco dockers, teamsters, teachers
and construction workers joined with CORE to fight racial segregation
and discrimination at the prestigious Palace Hotel. This helped
trigger the free speech fight at Berkeley just across the bay.</p>

<p>After sit-ins began against segregation, trade unionists picketed
or called sympathy strikes at companies like Woolworth&#8217;s.
Packinghouse workers joined pickets of the company&#8217;s stores with
placards declaring &#8216;If You Support Woolworth&#8217;s Here, You Support
Segregation in the South!&#8217; In New York 800 members of the Garment
Workers&#8217; Union turned out on a single afternoon.</p>

<p>Student activists demonstrated their solidarity with labour when
New York newspaper workers struck in 1962. A year later in Wisconsin
students organised a boycott of a car dealership chain involved in a
dispute with the UAW, in New York they backed striking retail and
hospital workers and in Oregon students joined auto workers on the
picket line.</p>

<p>Peter B. Levy&#8217;s <strong>The New Left and Labour in the 1960s</strong>
charts the uneasy relationship between the new generation of
revolutionaries which was emerging and the trade unions. The
breakdown of the alliance between trade union officialdom and SNCC,
CORE and SDS came over the two burning questions of the decade &#8211;
black liberation and the Vietnam War. The unions were extremely right
wing and conservative.</p>

<p>Many SDS leaders were &#8216;red diaper babies&#8217;, sons and daughters
of Communists and radicals who had been involved in the strike waves
and factory occupations of the 1930s and 1940s. Then the Communist
Party had grown to 100,000 and hundreds of thousands of American
workers experienced interracial solidarity as they fought to win
union organisation.</p>

<p>But any working class continuity with that tradition was broken by
the anti-Communist crusade of the 1950s spearheaded by Senator
McCarthy. The American ruling class, aided by the dominant union
leaders, helped create an ideological climate in which left wing
views of any shade were sidelined.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 1960s the leaders of the American unions
backed the new student groupings because they seemed to share their
distaste for Communism.</p>

<p>As early as 1964 a turning point was reached at that year&#8217;s
Democratic Party convention, when 68 pro-civil rights Freedom
Democrats challenged the right of 68 whites elected on the basis of
segregation to represent the state. The union leaders were desperate
to see President Johnson elected at all costs and didn&#8217;t want to
upset the Democrats&#8217; apple cart. Walter Reuther threatened Martin
Luther King with withdrawal of financial support unless the Freedom
Democrats backed down. This incident was held up by Stokeley
Carmichael and James Farmer of CORE as proving the need for blacks to
organise their own separate power base.</p>

<p>The head of the AFL-CIO (equivalent of the British TUC), George
Meany, wrote attacking the Black Panthers and Stokeley Carmichael:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;I&#8217;ve got news for Mr Carmichael, the reputed author
of the Black Power slogan. The Negro goons who go on racist rampages
know exactly what Black Power means. To them it is the chance to go
on a spree of violence with testimonial as a &#8220;freedom fighter&#8221;
for a cover.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Union leaders like Meany had turned their backs on fighting
discrimination on the shopfloor and even within the unions. But even
black union leaders joined in denouncing the revival of black
nationalism. Yet at grass roots level it was a different story. DRUM,
the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement, was formed among black car
workers in the Detroit area. In early 1968 at a Ford plant in New
Jersey black workers formed the United Black Brothers after the union
refused to act over racial harassment and organised a sit down
protest.</p>

<p>In May 1970 hard hatted construction workers marched through New
York in support of President Nixon and the war in Vietnam. Long
haired men passing by were set upon. This helped turn many radicals
away from any idea that ordinary workers could be a force for change.
Yet attitudes began to change as the realities of war came home to
working class America. A majority of union members polled in May
1970, 53 percent, opposed both Nixon&#8217;s extension of the war to
Cambodia and the construction workers&#8217; rampage in New York.</p>

<p>Levy concludes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Contrary to the stereotype of &#8220;hard hats&#8221; as
hawks, virtually every survey demonstrated that at any given time
manual workers were just as likely to oppose the war as were youths,
the archetypal doves.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">In the autumn of 1970, 63 percent of Detroit residents voted in a
city wide referendum for immediate US withdrawal from Vietnam. These
voters were overwhelmingly working class. By the end of 1971 Gallup
polls showed 61 percent favoured withdrawal with trade union
households supporting this view more than any other group except blacks.</p>

<p>The bodybags returning from Vietnam were overwhelmingly working
class, and black. The costs of the war ended Johnson&#8217;s War on
Poverty and increased inflation hit wage packets. On 15 October 1969
the anti-war movement called for workers to strike and join a
nationwide moratorium against the war. Levy suggests it might have
been &#8216;the single largest general strike&#8217; in US history. In New
York 40 trade unions endorsed the protest. Local UAW officials led
massive protests in the city and in Berkeley, while tens of thousands
of trade unionists rallied in central Detroit.</p>

<p>A month later between 500,000 and 800,000 people demonstrated in
Washington with another 250,000 protesting in San Francisco. Levy
notes that, while students predominated, vast numbers of trade
unionists were there joining in singing <em>Give Peace a Chance</em>.</p>

<p>Across America 1969 and 1970 saw a major wave of industrial
unrest, often involving unofficial, wildcat strikes. In the South
former SNCC and SDS activists had helped organise and lead strikes at
Levi Strauss plants (SDS chapters in New York, New Orleans and
Atlanta gave support by staging strip-ins of their jeans), in
Carolina textile plants, among Mississippi wood mills and Memphis
sanitation workers.</p>

<p>Early in 1969 Standard Oil workers struck in California. The
company obtained a court order limiting picket numbers. The strikers
responded by asking for outside help. Students from San Francisco and
Berkeley flocked to support them.</p>

<p>In October there was a strike lasting all winter at the giant
General Electric. Across the country students organised collections
of food and money, joined picket lines and took up the chant,
&#8216;Warmakers, Strikebreakers, Smash GE&#8217;. In the Boston area
students stopped GE from recruiting on campus. When student radicals
disrupted an address by the company&#8217;s vice-president at Boston
University they were met with a court injunction and club wielding
police. A strike against the subsequent arrests and suspensions got
the support of 10,000 students out of a total student body of 17,000.</p>

<p>In mid-1970 200,000 postal workers in New York defied a court
injunction and federal law to walk out in defiance of their union
leaders. The start of the college term in October 1970 coincided with
the biggest walkout, by 400,000 General Motors workers. A former SDS
leader organised 2,000 students in the Chicago area in support of the
strike. In Los Angeles law students gave strikers free advice,
students organised a strike benefit with Joan Baez and Arlo Guthrie,
and encouraged the Black Panthers to support strikers.</p>

<p>In this atmosphere tens of thousands of students rallied to left
wing ideas.</p>

<p>American capitalism had to adjust to contain the insurgency of the
1970s. President Nixon was hustled off amidst scandal to be replaced
by Gerald Ford and the Democrat Jimmy Carter. Carter signed an accord
with union leaders to police their members, helped promote the rise
of middle class blacks and implemented the monetarist policies
carried on by Reagan and Bush in the 1980s.</p>

<p>The book ends not in lamenting the passing of the spirit of the
1960s but in hope. As Levy points out, the 1960s removed forever the
America of &#8216;coat hanger abortions, school prayer, atmospheric
testing of atomic weapons, Jim Crow [institutionalised racial
segregation], wanton imperialism, mandatory ROTC, dress codes,
dormitory curfews, the draft, bomb shelters, strident (domestic)
anti-Communism and legal sexual and racial discrimination in the
workplace and housing market&#8217;.</p>

<p>Neither can America turn the clock back, whatever the sentimental
twaddle like Forrest Gump peddled by Hollywood. Working class America
carries all the scars and bitterness of the Reagan-Bush years. Peter
Levy quotes Martin Luther King on the eve of his assassination:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;I&#8217;ve been to the mountain top. And I&#8217;ve looked
over. And I&#8217;ve seen the promised land. I may not get there with
you. But I want you to know ... that we, as a people, will get to the
promised land.&#8217;</p>
