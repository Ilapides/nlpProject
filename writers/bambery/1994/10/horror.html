<p class="quoteb">&#8216;All my beautiful lovely safe world blew itself up here
with a great gust of high explosive love&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">To understand what Fitzgerald meant, visit this exhibition at
London&#8217;s Barbican Gallery and contrast two self portraits by the
German artist, Otto Dix. <em>Self portrait as a Soldier</em> was
painted in 1914 and showed his enthusiasm for the war in those early
months. A year later his <em>Self portrait as Shooting Target</em>
shows an entirely different man. Dix survived to produce a series of
etchings in 1924 showing disturbing images of the Western Front as a
counterblast to the militarism of the German right.</p>

<p>This exhibition looks at the reactions of <em>avant garde</em>
artists to the war. If the term <em>avant garde</em> is to mean
anything it describes a variety of artists who broke from the
classic, romantic tradition of the 19th century. They were rebelling
against a capitalist world and the impact of machinery and modern
production techniques. The front line of this movement was in those
cities which were being cast into the melting pot of mass
industrialisation &#8211; Vienna, Milan, Barcelona and St Petersburg.</p>

<p>When used to describe this generation of artists, the term <em>avant
garde</em> includes expressionism, where the object&#8217;s dimensions are
torn apart and its colours distorted to reveal its true nature. It
also includes futurism &#8211; a movement largely based in Italy and
Russia &#8211; where artists consciously wanted to celebrate the age of
the machine.</p>

<p>The Italian futurist, Marinetti, welcomed the war,
campaigning for Italy&#8217;s entry on the side of France and Britain,
because it would be &#8216;the health giver of the world&#8217;. This idea
was taken up by the British futurist, Christopher Nevinson, who
stated in 1915:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;This war will be a violent incentive to Futurism, for
we believe that there is no beauty except in strike, and no
masterpiece without aggressiveness&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">The slaughter led Nevinson to break from abstract art to produce
in 1916 <em>La Patrie</em>, a painting of dead and wounded lying in a
Dunkirk shed waiting evacuation. A year later the British government
censored Nevinson&#8217;s <em>Paths of Glory</em>, because it depicted
British dead. Nevinson&#8217;s <em>War Profiteers</em> gives a political
edge to his anger.</p>

<p>In 1913 Jacob Epstein exhibited a metal sculpture of the torso of
a man working with a drill. In 1916 he returned to lop off its limbs
to produce a shocking portrayal of terrible, frightening wounds.</p>

<p>There is in this exhibition a sense of premonition in the final
years before the war of what lay ahead. Bohumil Kubista, serving with
the army of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the Balkan Wars of 1912
and 1913, painted <em>Heavy Artillery in Action</em>, which could have
been any of the battles three or four years later &#8211; the Somme,
Verdun or Passchendaele. The German artist, Franz Marc, died at
Verdun, but in 1913 he painted <em>The Unfortunate Land of Tyrol</em>,
which seems to herald a future cataclysm.</p>

<p>The title of this exhibition, <em>A Bitter Truth</em>, gives a
good sense of experiences and reactions to the war of the various
artists on exhibition here. There are some exceptions. Walter
Sickert, by 1914 an establishment figure, has two paintings on show
celebrating &#8216;brave little Belgium&#8217;, whose defence was the reason
presented for Britain&#8217;s war with Germany. The American artist
George Bellows returned to this theme shortly after his country&#8217;s
entry into the war with <em>Massacre at Dinant</em>, depicting the
massacres supposedly inflicted on Belgian civilians by the conquering
German army.</p>

<p>The British artist Paul Nash&#8217;s sense of despair is on display in
his ironically titled <em>We are Making a New World</em>, showing the
day breaking over the shattered landscape of the trenches. Nash&#8217;s
<em>The Mule Track</em>, far from being a celebration of the machine,
shows all the horrors of modern technology in the shape of high
velocity shells and shrapnel being unleashed on humanity.</p>

<p>There is a common sense of horror at the realities of the war. But
beyond that it is difficult to say more. In the world that emerged
after 1918 much of the <em>avant garde</em> was moving into the
mainstream &#8211; as can be seen with the English artist, Stanley
Spencer. Even in his 1916 depiction of a dressing station in
Macedonia there is no cry of anger. It is almost as if in death or
suffering there is redemption. By 1922 his <em>Unveiling Cookham War
Memorial</em> seems to be a celebration of the timeless Englishness of
this Thames Valley village.</p>

<p>Whatever the similarities between the different artists showing
here, they were moving in different directions &#8211; artistically and
politically. For, as the war ended in revolution, the two could not
be separated.</p>

<p>The Russian artist Malevich made six lithographs in 1914 appealing
in a naive, cartoon like style to support the Tsar&#8217;s war effort. By
the war&#8217;s end Malevich supported the Bolshevik Revolution. The
Italian futurist, Marinetti, became a champion of Mussolini&#8217;s
fascism &#8211; a political path followed by the British artist Wyndham Lewis.</p>

<p>This exhibition offers something more than &#8216;war is hell&#8217;. The
experience of war was a threshold to a more fragmented and
unconfident world. This is a world with which we are familiar and
that&#8217;s why anyone who has a couple of hours to spare should make an
effort to see this exhibition.</p>

<p>The final word must go to the works of those artists working in
Germany between the wars end and the victory of Nazism. The
sculptures and woodcuts of Kathe Kollwitz, George Grosz&#8217;s drawing
<em>Berlin Street Scene</em> and Dix&#8217;s etchings are works of artists
who have gone beyond examining the bitter truth of the war to portray
the naked reality of the society which spawned such horrors.</p>
