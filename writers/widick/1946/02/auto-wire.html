<p class="fst">DETROIT, FEB 12 (BY WIRE) &ndash; A CITY-WIDE STRIKE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING ALL GENERAL MOTORS LOCALS IN AREA TODAY ACCUSED THE UNITED ELECTRICAL, RADIO AND MACHINE WORKERS UNION-CIO OF A DOUBLE-CROSS IN ACCEPTING 18&frac12; CENTS AN HOUR WAGE INCREASE FROM GM.</p>

<p>THIS ACTION CAME AT THE SAME TIME GM OFFERED TO SETTLE THE 85-DAY STRIKE OF 175,000 WORKERS BY GRANTING AN 18&frac12; CENTS AN HOUR WAGE INCREASE, PROVIDED THE UAW-CIO GAVE UP MAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSHIP CLAUSE IN OLD CONTRACT. GM LIKEWISE DEMANDED EXCLUSION FROM OLD CONTRACT OF ANY IMPROVEMENTS ONCE GRANTED BY WAR LABOR BOARD IN PREVIOUS DIRECTIVES. THIS OFFER REJECTED IMMEDIATELY BY UAW-CIO, AFTER STALINIST-DOMINATED UERMWA BROKE SOLID FRONT AGAINST GM AND SIGNED A SEPARATE AGREEMENT COVERING SOME 25,000 UE WORKERS AT GM.</p>

<p>THE UE-CIO MOVE STUNNED ENTIRE LABOR MOVEMENT, WAS ATTACKED QUICKLY BY R.J. THOMAS, PRESIDENT OF UAW-CIO. HOWEVER, THE REAL BLAST AGAINST THIS MOVE CAME BY THE DELEGATES REPRESENTING ALL GM LOCALS HERE.</p>

<p>GM TOOK QUICK ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST BLUNDER IN TOP CIO CIRCLES TO PRESS FOR ITS OFFER WHICH IS LOWER IN TWO RESPECTS THAN THAT RECOMMENDED BY TRUMAN&rsquo;S FACT-FINDING BOARD. LATTER HAD SUGGESTED A 19&frac12; CENTS AN HOUR WAGE INCREASE AND REINSTATEMENT OF THE OLD CONTRACT WHICH GM HAS REPUDIATED.</p>

<p>GM OFFERED ONE SOP IN ITS LATEST MANEUVER TO WEAKEN THE UAW. IT SAID IT WOULD ACCEPT THE CHECKOFF IF THE UAW ELIMINATED MAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSHIP.</p>

<p>ONE-HALF HOUR AFTER THIS OUTRAGEOUS PROPOSAL WAS MADE, THE UAW-CIO COMMITTEE, HEADED BY WALTER REUTHER, STORMED OUT OF THE MEETING AND ANNOUNCED THAT NEGOTIATIONS WERE AGAIN BROKEN OFF.</p>
