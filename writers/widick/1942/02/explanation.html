<h2>Jack Wilson</h2>

<h1>Explanation!</h1>

<h3>(February 1942)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Labor Action</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/laboraction-ny/1942/index.htm#la06_05" target="new">Vol. 6 No. 5</a>, 2 February 1942, p.&#160;2.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">My attention has been called to a sentence in an article I wrote last week for <strong>Labor Action</strong> which is open to misinterpretation. It reads: &#8220;Even if Lewis does not appear this week before the CIO executive board, the ill-concealed threat he has of pulling the miners, and other unions he influences, out of the CIO into a unified labor movement is sufficient to speak more eloquently at the CIO executive board than,&#8221; etc. It goes without saying that any attempt on the part of Lewis to &#8220;pull the miners&#8221; out of the CIO would be an outrage perpetrated upon the interests of the labor movement as a whole and an act of disloyalty and split not less reprehensible than the one committed sometime ago by Dubinsky in withdrawing the ILGWU from affiliation to the CIO.</p>

<p>It is equally obvious that for the miners to split from the CIO and join the AFL would not at all signify that the labor movement has been genuinely and effectively united. I want to emphasize this as heavily as I can, just because the loosely-worded phrase in last week&#8217;s issue may have given rise to a misunderstanding of our real position.</p>
