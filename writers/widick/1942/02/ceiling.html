<p class="fst"><B>The Roosevelt Administration joined hands this week with the
powerful corporations to prevent the CIO from obtaining a nationwide
demand for a dollar-a-day wage increase to meet the mounting cost of
living.</B></p>

<p><I>Leon Henderson, Roosevelt&rsquo;s price administrator, sent a
letter to the War Labor Board, which has before it two crucial CIO
test cases, and urged the board not to grant any substantial wage
increases.</I></p>

<p>Last Friday at the White House, President Roosevelt had read the
same letter to the six-man CIO-AFL board which had its first meeting
with him, according to the <B>New York Times</B>.</p>

<p>Significantly, neither, Phillip Murray nor William Green told
their union ranks after the meeting with Roosevelt that he had put
pressure on them against getting wage increases.</p>

<p>The CIO has before the War Labor Board the cases involving the
Little Steel companies and their 155,000 employees. The SWOC, as part
of the CIO, has demanded one dollar a day wage increases and the
union shop from these companies.</p>

<p>Apparently knowing that the Roosevelt administration would assist
them to beat down labor, the steel companies refused to grant any
important concessions, and now the case is before the War Labor
Board.</p>

<p>Since the War Labor Board itself is packed with friends of
business, they hardly need any encouragement to turn down pleas of
the CIO for wage increases and union security.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>FDR&rsquo;s Encouragement</h4>

<p class="fst">However, the open assistance of Roosevelt and Henderson will give
them further courage to prevent labor from getting enough wages to
begin to meet the rising cost of living.</p>

<p>The fact that the CIO auto union also is demanding one dollar a
day and the union shop, and that the CIO aluminum workers have
presented a similar set of demands to their bosses, makes the steel
union demands before the War Labor Board decisive, since the verdict
of the board in the steel situation will be the precedent for the
other union negotiations.</p>

<p>The wages of nearly 1,000,000 CIO men from coast to coast are
directly involved in the demands before the War Labor Board, and the
action of the President and Henderson therefore is a serious frontal
attack at the CIO standards.</p>

<p>The mood of the ranks of the CIO, under the pressure of the rising
cost of living, and the terrible toll that priorities unemployment is
taking, were indicated over the week-end in the conference of over
160 delegates to the General Motors division of the CIO union in
Detroit.</p>

<p>Even R.J. Thomas, president of the CIO auto union, talked in
tough, plain language, fitting into the mood of the ranks who are fed
up with the present run-around they are getting everywhere.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Some people say we should give up the class
struggle. I don&rsquo;t know much about the class struggle. All I am
interested in is better economic conditions,&rdquo; etc., etc.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Pressure from Ranks</h4>

<p class="fst">Thomas&rsquo; Speech doesn&rsquo;t mean that the CIO top
leadership suddenly has decided to go all-out in struggling for
labor&rsquo;s just demands. It shows, rather, how the leadership is
being forced to respond to the pressure of the ranks, and put up some
kind of a fight for the CIO demands. The Thomas speech assumes
special importance in view of the fact that he was one of the six men
at the White House conference last Friday.</p>

<p>The major argument of Henderson and the President against granting
labor and wage increases was such an insulting one to the
intelligence of workers, that apparently none of the top AFL or CIO
leaders fell for it. It was the stock argument of all reactionaries
at all times against wage increases.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you increase wages, prices will go up, and inflation
will result,&rdquo; claimed Henderson in his letter to the War Labor
Board.</p>

<p>But labor knows that big industry is falling over itself in the
huge profits pouring in from war orders. All labor is asking today is
that part of those profits be turned into wage benefits. This could
be done easily, without in the slightest increasing prices generally.</p>

<p>Big business always tries to increase all prices, every time it is
forced to pay a wage increase, thereby trying to pass off the cost on
the consumer. But the Roosevelt regime could prevent that easily,
simply by telling the Corporations they couldn&rsquo;t raise prices,
and that labor&rsquo;s wage demands should be granted by taking them
out of the profit.</p>

<p>Instead, we have the brazen attempts of the administration to
assure big industry that its war profits will be safeguarded, while
labor pays the burden of the war on the battlefield, in the factory
and at the store.</p>
