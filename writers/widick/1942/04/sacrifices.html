<h1>UAW Sacrifices While the Auto Barons Profiteer!</h1>

<h4>UAW Bloc Hits Double Time Surrender</h4>

<h3>(April 1942)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Labor Action</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/laboraction-ny/1942/index.htm#la06_15" target="new">Vol. 6 No. 15</a>, 12 April 1942, pp.&#160;1&#160;&amp;&#160;2.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst"><em>Even though it was sugar-coated and marked with a fancy label, &#8220;Victory Through Equality of Sacrifice,&#8217;&#8217; many delegates or the CIO Auto Workers emergency conference found the recommendations of the executive board a bitter pill to swallow!</em></p>

<p>In proposing that the union give up its present overtime standards for Saturday, Sunday and holiday work, in reaffirming its relinquishing of strikes, in placing all disputes to mediation or arbitration, the executive board statement declared: &#8220;To the above contributions we commit ourselves without conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>That is, no matter what the auto barons do or don&#8217;t do, the union leadership insisted that labor sacrifice some more of its gains. And this is what stuck in the throats of many delegates and is burning up the men in the shops.</p>

<p>&#8220;The story is that thousands of war workers here, as represented by the men who came out of the shops to attend this convention, are in no mood for one-sided sacrifices. They don&#8217;t like being called nasty names by the bank-president congressmen, profit-hoarding industrialists and well-paid editorial writers,&#8221; is the way <strong>PM</strong>&#8217;s correspondent described it.</p>

<p>&#8220;They feel it is high time for Congress and industry to start practicing &#8216;equality of sacrifice.&#8217; If this new concession is just greeted by demands for more, they will get fighting mad,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>The stormy six-hour debate, which the <strong>Daily Worker</strong>&#8217;s correspondent described as &#8220;the tensest as any witnessed at labor conventions in years,&#8221; ended when the combined efforts of the entire top leadership of the union and President Roosevelt&#8217;s direct intervention swung a big majority behind the proposals of the executive board.</p>

<p>But even these pro-UAW leadership correspondents pointed out, &#8220;the sentiment ... was far more evenly divided than the final balloting showed.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is extremely significant since the conference could not reflect the views of the men in the shop as well as a convention, for the executive boards and bargaining committees of local unions attended the sessions in a body, and no elections were held in many locals!</p>

<p>&#8220;The minor functionaries, who deal daily with the gripes and uncertainties and resentments of the rank and file, were less disposed to accept unconditional abandonment of double Sunday pay,&#8221; the <strong>PM</strong> correspondent wrote.</p>

<p>Since the decisions of this conference are subject to ratification by the locals, it is by no means certain that the retreat of the union leaders will be backed by the ranks of labor who are getting tired of an appeasement policy.</p>

<p>The ten-point program submitted to the &#8220;President and the Congress of the United States for adoption,&#8221; is contained below.</p>

<p>Before analyzing it, which will be done more thoroughly in subsequent issues of <strong>Labor Action</strong>, we would like to make a general point: It is a &#8220;watered down&#8221; version of the Murray plan, whose three basic objectives were along the lines of this ten-point program!</p>

<p>And what happened to the Murray plan? Has the CIO dropped it?</p>

<p>Another question: How do the auto workers&#8217; leaders propose to carry out this plan? By retreating some more on every issue?</p>

<p>Do the Auto Workers Union leaders expect to kid anyone into thinking that any plan proposed by labor, whether it is good or bad, will stand a chance in a Congress packed with poll-tax politicians?</p>

<p>A union leadership which failed so miserably to give labor constructive and far-sighted direction, which retreats ignobly before every attack of the labor-baiters, is hardly one which will struggle effectively for any program adopted by the Auto Workers Union.</p>

<p>Fresh leadership in the unions and a new kind of congressman, workers&#8217; representatives chosen to speak fpr the men in the plants as labor congressmen, are an indispensable prerequiste to carry out a militant program that safeguards labor&#8217;s interests in the war and afterward! Or to carry out the good features of the ten-point program submitted to the Auto Workers Union.</p>

<p>The UAW ten-point program follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>End all war profiteering.</li>

<li>No luxuries in wartime; no war millionaires.</li>

<li>Stop rising costs; prevent inflation.</li>

<li>Rationing of all food, clothing, housing and other necessities.</li>

<li>Adjustment of wages to meet increased living costs.</li>

<li>Security for dependants of men and women in the armed services.</li>

<li>Moratorium on debts.</li>

<li>Labor&#8217;s contribution to production.</li>

<li>Post-war planning.</li>

<li>Upon the acceptance and adoption of the foregoing measures, we agree that all wages for time over 40 hours shall be paid in the form of non-negotiable Special Defense Bonds.</li>
</ol>
