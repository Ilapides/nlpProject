<p class="fst">The Nazi army achieved a major tactical success with serious
strategic implications in the one-week-old counter-offensive on the
Western front.</p>

<p>Already the major objective of the German high command has been
attained: Complete disruption of Allied military plans for an
offensive from the West.</p>

<p>The complete surprise and brilliant gains won by the German army
stand as a sharp criticism of the Allied military leaders, who were
caught flat-footed by the offensive.</p>
<p>The basic reason for the surprise was not merely over-confidence
carelessness and poor leadership: above all, it flowed from a
fundamentally erroneous conception of German strength.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 CLASS="western">Why It Happened</h4>

<p class="fst">The question has been asked, time and again, how did Von Runstedt
manage to mount such a large-scale offensive without detection by
Allied air reconnaissance, or by intelligence?</p>

<p>Significantly, there had been reports of German &ldquo;reserves&rdquo;
pouring into the front. These movements had been seen. But they were
totally misinterpreted. The Allied high command assumed that these
German troops marching to the front were replacements.</p>

<p><em>The Allied high command, in a word, overestimated seriously the
effects, on the German army of the deadly battle of attrition
(blood-letting) raging on the Western front.</em></p>

<p><em>Also, the Allied high command excluded the possibility of the
Wehrmacht making any serious counter-offensive, because it accepted
the popular view that Germany was on its last legs. (Max Werner was
the most vociferous exponent of this false idea.)</em></p>

<p>That is why the Wehrmacht did the &ldquo;impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Allied view was that the German armies were operating on a
shoestring, One serious large-scale battle would seal its fate.
Eisenhower&rsquo;s winter offensive was begun for precisely that
reason. His prediction of an early conclusion to the European phase
of the war arose from this theory he held.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 CLASS="western">German Strategy Becomes Clearer</h4>

<p class="fst">Front line dispatches, and the usual distortion by headline
writers deceived the American public into believing that the winter
offensive was succeeding. Actually, the only important gains were
made in strictly secondary areas, Eisenhower&rsquo;s major drive in
the Aachen sector was limited. This was the background for the German
counter-offensive, from the Western front.</p>

<p><em>One other major factor, however, must be taken into
consideration, namely the situation on the Eastern front and its
relation to the events on the Western front.</em></p>

<p>The German high command, in a repetition of its strategy of the
First World War, although the strategy was in slightly different
form, had decided to force a decision on the West, while weakening
its strength in the East.</p>

<p><em>Von Runstedt judged that the Russian armies would not make a
major offensive of sufficient strength to derail his Western front.
schedule. The comparative inactivity of the Soviet army on the vital
Polish-East Prussian front, its preoccupation with political
maneuvers in the Balkans and Hungary and its lack of offensive punch,
which exhausted itself seriously in the summer drives these factors
determined Von Runstedt's strategy. It was simply an application of
German military views as ably presented by von Leeb in his major
work, <strong>Die Abwehr</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Thus far, the only Allied counter-measures have been the series of
counter-attacks, rear-guard actions and air blows against the German
advance when weather permits.</p>

<p>The hope has been expressed by Eisenhower that the present German
offensive is the last big gamble of the German high Command; that
German reserves are committed, so deeply that the present battle can
be turned into a decisive one in which Allied quantitative
superiority finally will emerge as victor.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 CLASS="western">Struggle Will Sharpen</h4>

<p class="fst">This idea contains the same fundamental approach as the one on
which the Allied high command operated. It presupposes a lack &ldquo;of
the independent will of the enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is quite probable that von Runstedt, who doesn&rsquo;t make
many mistakes, has defined his objectives exactly. Perhaps the major
part of the counter-offensive has already been finished. Von Runstedt
might easily be occupied in exploiting the remnants of his victory.</p>

<p><em>Already he has succeeded in disrupting for a few months any
Allied offensive against Germany. Once he consolidates his gains he
hopes to turn his attention to any belated Russian moves.</em></p>

<p><em>Even if the Allies finally drive him back to the Siegfried
line, the job will be a costly one, adding to the losses sustained in
the present defeat. In any case, the Wehrmacht is assured of more
time for other counter-measures to an all-out offensive.</em></p>
