The &ldquo;new caucus&rdquo; in the United Automobile Workers, CIO, headed by Dick Leonard, former vice-president, found itself divided and denounced by two members of its national steering committee for &ldquo;red-baiting.&rdquo;</P><P><I>The <B>Daily Worker</B> on Monday, August 8, carried a story from Detroit that spilled some beans on his &ldquo;new caucus.&rdquo; Just read the story and imagine the discomfiture of the self-professed &ldquo;progressives&rdquo; and true-blooded &ldquo;revolutionists&rdquo; who are involved in that miserable conglomeration called the Leonard caucus.</I></P><P>&ldquo;Leonard, professing to speak for 100 locals in Michigan, lifted a leaf from Reuther&rsquo;s own campaign for UAW presidency a year ago by announcing that his group will not allow the Communist Party to have a voice in union affairs.&rdquo; When Reuther said that, he was denounced by the CP and the SWP for &ldquo;red-baiting.&rdquo; What does the SWP say now? Thus far, it has given the impression of taking full political responsibility for the line of the Leonard caucus.</P><P>Tracy Doll and Whitey Urban denounced this part of Leonard&rsquo;s statement. &ldquo;Urban said Leonard issued his statement without Leonard&rsquo;s caucus leaders getting an opportunity to see it, despite the fact that their names were signed to it.&rdquo; Is this an example of the &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; to be practiced by a Leonard regime in the UAW-CIO? Or, even worse, was this statement released with the approval of Ernie Mazey and John Anderson?</P><P>&ldquo;To make the red-baiting dish palatable to the auto workers, who are dissatisfied with the wage-cutting GM escalator settlement and dropping of a number of basic demands in the Ford settlement, Leonard took a fly swat at Reuther&rsquo;s handling of these settlements,&rdquo; the <B>Daily Worker</B> said. We must admit that the characterization of Leonard&rsquo;s program as a &ldquo;fly swat&rdquo; is rather accurate.<BR>&nbsp;</P><H4>No Sign of Life</H4><p class="fst">Incidentally, as the time nears for the GM workers to obtain an automatic wage increase due to the escalator clause, it is becoming more and more uncomfortable for the alleged &ldquo;left wing,&rdquo; Leonard included, to talk about the GM contract approving &ldquo;wage cuts.&rdquo;</P><P><I>We forgot to mention three other prominent individuals in this &ldquo;new caucus.&rdquo; They are Paul Silvers, Mel Bishop and Lloyd Jones. The inclusion of Mel Bishop is especially interesting. Certain self-styled &ldquo;progressives&rdquo; used as one of their main reasons for not supporting the Reuther tendency the fact that he had &ldquo;reactionaries&rdquo; like Mel Bishop in his. Bishop, according to these sources, was guilty of &ldquo;slugging and beating up progressives.&rdquo; But, then, that is a trifle, for Bishop apparently has &ldquo;reformed,&rdquo; about as much as Leonard has become a progressive.</I></P><P>Now that the Wayne County CIO convention has been ordered for September 2, 3 and 4, it will be very interesting to watch this new caucus in action. Its birth, or more exactly, its still-birth, hardly gives assurances of any healthy life.</P><p class="link">&#160;<br /><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" width="100%" /><p class="linkback"><a href="../../index.html">B.J.
