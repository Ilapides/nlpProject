<p class="fst">We were guzzling a bottle of beer with a buck private near an Army camp when a couple of officers walked in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t have to salute them any more, outside of camp,&#8221; he told us, sighing with relief. &#8220;You&#8217;d go nuts trying to salute all of them,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>And then his (ace brightened. &#8220;Say, do you know that last Saturday night a bunch of the Minnesota boys were at a joint and they had their arms around each other!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody catching the point. I asked what was so unusual about that. &#8220;The officers and the men. Two louies and some of the boys. They were singing songs together. you know, and holding themselves with their arms around each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said it like it was the seventh miracle. He still couldn&#8217;t quite believe it.</p>

<p>You see, he had been a National Guardsman for seven years and was properly trained as an American soldier. He had learned that officers and men don&#8217;t mix. It ain&#8217;t Kosher, as they say down South.</p>

<p>Officers and men. That&#8217;s two different and separate classes. None of this baloney about democracy they feed you in civil life.</p>

<p>And he told us more.</p>

<p>Army life isn&#8217;t what it used to be a few years ago. They have a million sergeants now, it seems, compared to the old days. A sergeant, and not a corporal, is in command of a squad. Superficially, the vast increases in &#8220;non-coms&#8221; looks like a &#8220;democratization&#8221; of the Army. The opposite is true. More rigid control is possible over the ranks by having a &#8220;spread&#8221; in command, by building a huge corps of sergeants between the officers and the men. It&#8217;s the three stripe boys who handle the discipline of the men. And it&#8217;s a rule that the officer always backs the sergeant against the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;You gotta have control of the men.&#8221; If he can&#8217;t take them out and beat the hell out of them, he&#8217;s through. One of mine didn&#8217;t last long. Behind the barracks is where they settle the question.</p>

<p>How about promotions? &#8220;I was a sergeant once. Got transferred and had to start all over again. An officer? Naw. I don&#8217;t want to be one. Look at all the dough they dish out in uniforms. Over $700 a year.&#8221; He was satisfied to remain in the ranks.</p>

<p>He was vague about the war. &#8220;If you gotta fight, you gotta fight.&#8221; He was ready. Why? He didn&#8217;t know. He was proud of his efficiency in handling machines. &#8220;Brother, you could blindfold me and I&#8217;ll take any gun apart and put it back together again in no time.&#8221; Such is Army life today.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Jimmy Stewart and John Nobody</h4>

<p class="fst">Another slant on the Army is furnished by telling two incidents related to draft classification.</p>

<p>As most readers know, Jimmy Stewart is a Hollywood movie star. The typical American young man, good looking, a nice guy, a believer in democracy and virtue, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>Stewart drew a low draft order number. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to serve at any time,&#8221; he told the press.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, it appeared. Jimmy&#8217;s number was up. He was to be drafted. And then Major Plato, head of the California Selective Service Board, announced a temporary deferment for Stewart. &#8220;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer asked for it.&#8221; Major Plato said.</p>

<p>A storm of protest followed. As one movie critic put it in his nationally syndicated column, &#8220;What&#8217;s indispensable to national defense in making love to Hedy Lamarr at $2,000 a week?&#8221; And how will the average draftee feel about that?</p>

<p>So 24 hours later Major Plato blandly denied that Stewart had been deferred by request, but rather he was reclassified because he was 10 pounds under weight.</p>

<p>Sounds plausible if you ignore the background as related here, which we hope you don&#8217;t. But even the new excuse is a flimsy one.</p>

<p>It happens that an Ohio acquaintance of ours out here was called for his final medical exam. A fellow who&#8217;s out here for his health.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you walk into the doctor&#8217;s office you know you&#8217;re near the Army. He treats you just a little better than a dog, but not much. Under other circumstances I sure would like to have smacked him one, the way he growled and snorted,&#8221; the Ohio fellow said.</p>

<p>But to get back to the main point. &#8220;It broke the doctor&#8217;s heart that he had to reject me. At first he thought I was only 25 pounds under weight and he was going to O.K. me, but when it was even more, he said I wouldn&#8217;t go, at least this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they&#8217;ll take a poor man who is plenty under weight but exempt a rich man like Stewart who is only slightly under weight. &#8220;I told the doctor that while I personally was indifferent to being in or out of the Army. I didn&#8217;t like the method he went about it, because of the Jimmy Stewart business. Then I was shown the door.&#8221;</p>
