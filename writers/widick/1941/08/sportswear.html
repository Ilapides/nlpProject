<p class="fst">LOS ANGELES &#8211; The International Ladies Garment Workers Union here made big inroads into the sweatshops manufacturing sportswear through the militancy of its striking workers during the past week.</p>

<p>In addition, the dressmakers won a 15 per cent wage increase following their brief strike which began simultaneously with the sportswear walk-out. Union contracts, of course were signed again.</p>

<p>Over 21 shops were brought under union contract in the sportswear division during the week, when employers realized that the militant demonstrations, featuring mass picket lines, meant business.</p>

<p>Skirmishes on the picket line brought six false arrests as cops interfered in an effort to intimidate the strikers. Rose Pesotta, international vice-president of the ILGWU, was arrested twice in one day along with five workers, including Edith Mann, special union organizer.</p>

<p>The union contract includes a 5 per cent wage increase and other regular union provisions. It is the first time that this section of the clothing industry here has been organized and put under union contract.</p>

<p>Hundreds of workers are in the union and under contract conditions now, were previously unorganized and in open shops.</p>

<p>The issuance of strike benefits over the week-end brought new courage to the strikers and increased the determination to win in as many of the remaining shops as possible.</p>

<p>Since there are around 40 shops scattered through the city which still remain unorganized or have only a few workers on strike, a big job lies ahead for the union.</p>

<p>Consolidating the newly-organized workers into the union and putting teeth into the contracts looms as a vital task for the union.</p>

<p>However, a solid foundation now exists for full union victory over a period of time because of the tremendous steps forward resulting from the present strike.</p>
