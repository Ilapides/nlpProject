<h4>Union-Buster Arnold</h4>

<p class="fst">One of the most important developments in the trade
union field in recent months has been the beginning of a nationwide
campaign against the teamsters union by Thurman Arnold, United States
Attorney General, under the charge that the truck drivers are
violating the Sherman anti-trust law through certain kinds of
contracts signed with employers.</p>

<p>John C. Haefele, attorney for truck drivers local
407, IBT, submitted to Arnold an outline of the procedure in
Cleveland, which requires drivers for long distance hauling companies
which have contracts with the union to turn over their loads at
various terminals in the city for delivery within the city limits by
local drivers.</p>

<p>Arnold, in a letter to the Indianapolis Central Labor
Union, wrote that perhaps this kind of contract was a probable
violation <FONT SIZE=2>of </FONT>the Sherman Act by a union as
&ldquo;unreasonable restraints designed to compel the hiring of
useless and unnecessary labor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An example is the requirement that on each
truck entering a city there be a member of the local teamsters union
in addition to the driver who is already on the truck,&rdquo; Arnold
wrote.</p>

<p>While indicating that he is not seeking to obtain a
ruling on the legality of the procedure followed by the Cleveland
teamsters union, Haefele wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;It is the desire of the officers and
members of local 407 to cooperate fully with the Department of
Justice in supporting the laws of the United States of America. It is
with this thought in mind that we are requesting a fuller
interpretation of your statement in order to clarify, justify and
determine the future acts on the part of the officers and members of
local Union 407.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Cleveland Contract</h4>

<p class="fst">Haefele&rsquo;s brief describes a contract between
local 407 and the Cleveland Group of Certified and Permit Motor
Carriers, an organization of 71 operators in the Cleveland area,
which includes a clause specifying that &ldquo;drivers for member
companies entering Cleveland must deliver directly to a terminal or
may deliver or pick up a load within a one-mile radius of an
employer&rsquo;s terminal, but that such truck drivers may not make
deliveries or pick ups elsewhere in the Cleveland area.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;It has been the practice of both
local trucking concerns and the union, in cases where a truck is
operated into the Cleveland Area from distant points, to have a local
union member operate such truck from the terminal to the point of
delivery,&rdquo; the brief states.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;We believe that it is to the public
interest that a local man, who generally knows the city better and
who has not just left a fast moving public highway, should complete
the work of making delivery.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;The number of accidents on city
streets involving long-distance motor transports has been drastically
reduced since the system was adopted and consignees have found
deliveries more rapid.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;Of course, our men do not begin from
their service except at a terminal, unless the shipper designates
otherwise, in which case our driver meets the truck on telephonic
advice of the shipper,&rdquo; the brief continues.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;We have never required that an extra
driver be (hired in addition to the regular driver on a truck
entering Cleveland on a terminal-to-terminal basis.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;Now then, it is our opinion that the
hiring of men under the above statement of facts and by virtue of
existing agreements does not come under the category of
unreasonableness , as defined by you as a violation of the anti-trust
law.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;Immediately on the public
announcement of your views on this matter our local union
discontinued the use of a local driver to complete local deliveries
for those who were not in contractual relationship with us, and we
shall continue this policy until you have more fully informed us,&rdquo;
the brief concludes.</p>

<p class="fst">Edward Murphy, president of local 407, and a
vice-president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union,
said that the procedure used in Cleveland was similar to that in many
other cities, thereby giving the Cleveland situation a nationwide
importance.</p>
