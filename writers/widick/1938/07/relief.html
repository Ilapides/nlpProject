<p class="fst">AKRON, Ohio. &#8211; A campaign to provide for supplementary relief for W.P.A. and industrial employee along the lines of the &#8220;Minneapolis plan&#8221; was begun here this week by the Akron C.I.O. council and Goodyear Local, United Rubber Workers of America.</p>

<p>By mobilizing the labor movement behind this fight, union leaders seek to revitalize the unions and to alleviate the suffering of thousands of families living on sub-existence levels.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Praise Local 544</h4>

<p class="fst">The campaign was announced in the <strong>Summit County Labor News</strong>, which gave much credit to the Minneapolis Teamsters Unions for initiating the system of supplementary relief on a sound basis.</p>

<p>Over 110,000 of the 225,000 inhabitants of Akron are on one kind of relief or another, and thousands of rubber workers are working less than two days a week, thereby making a system of supplementary relief indispensible for the sheer existence of the people.</p>

<p>The plan of the Akron unionists was indicated in a resolution passed by Goodyear Local and the C.I.O. council. It reads:<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Text of Resolution</h4>

<p class="quoteb">Whereas, The present amount of wages received by W.P.A. workers and by part-time industrial employees is not sufficient to meet the minimum standard of living needs, especially of large families, and</p>

<p class="quoteb">Whereas, This grave situation has been solved mainly in one city, Minneapolis, as indicated in a recent issue of the <strong>Northwest Organizer</strong>, official Teamsters Joint Council publication, and</p>

<p class="quoteb">Whereas, The solution was achieved through the introduction of a system of supplementary relief for any company or W.P.A. employee whose wages were insufficient to permit a family to have a minimum standard of living whose cost was determined by a union survey, and</p>

<p class="quoteb">Whereas, Under the system of supplementary relief, the employee of either a private concern or of the W.P.A. obtains in cash the difference between his wages and the amount needed for the minimum standard, as shown by the attached clipping from the <strong>Northwest Organizer</strong>, therefore, Ask Supplementary Relief</p>

<p class="quoteb">Be it resolved, That we go on record in favor of such a system of supplementary relief, and that we seek to institute a similar system in Akron, in conjunction with the proper authorities, and that we urge the entire labor movement and the Workers Alliance to join with this union in the campaign.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The campaign is not being made as a substitute for jobs, or adequate wages. Union leaders see it as a good supplementary move to fight against the effects of the social crisis and to place the burden on the rich.</p>

<p>Already, relief officials have announced giving of more liberal allowances, and of permitting part time industrial employees to obtain W.P.A. jobs or relief while holding down their regular jobs.</p>
