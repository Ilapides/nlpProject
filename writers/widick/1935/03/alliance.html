<p class="fst">AKRON, Ohio, March 8. &ndash; A significant turn with
far-reaching implications was made by the American Federation of
Labor here today with the establishment of an alliance between the
auto and the rubber workers&rsquo; unions to work together in the
current campaigns for recognition and the &ldquo;threatened&rdquo;
strikes in both industries.</P>
<P>Suddenly changing previous plan to bring John Lewis,
U.M.W.A president, here, the A.F. of L. had Francis J. Dillon, chief
auto organizer speak at a mass meeting of all rubber workers unions
here and pledges were exchanged to aid each [other].</P>
<P>Thus the A.F. of L. was finally forced to admit the
close relationship between these two basic industries. Rubber tire
production depends primarily on sales to the auto manufacturers and
they have admitted that a strike in the auto industry, if begun, must
likewise be met with a similar strike in rubber as a tie-up of the
auto industry would automatically close Akron factories.</P>
<P>This latest move can best be interpreted as an
attempt of the A.F. of L. to bolster its weak position in the auto
industry and its rapidly weakening role in rubber by building
prestige through this vague &ldquo;united front&rdquo; It is also an
attempt to display a strong front to manufacturers in the vain hope
of thereby obtaining recognition without resorting to strikes.</P>
<P>However, Dillon told the rubber workers that April 1
was the date set for action in Detroit and this was followed by a
speech of Coleman Claherty in which he said rubber manufacturers
would be given one week to begin negotiations or a strike would be
called.</P>
<P>That the workers mean to take these two organizers at
their word was shown by the tremendous applause which greeted them
whenever militant tones were adopted in their speech and especially
when threat of a strike was made. The Goodyear, Goodrich and
Firestone locals are sending committees to try to begin negotiations
this week with the manufacturers. A strike has been threatened if
manufacturers refuse.</P>
