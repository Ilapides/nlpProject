<p class="fst">AKRON, Ohio. &#8211; New and delicate problems confront the Workers Party and all class conscious elements in the rubber industry here as the department of justice began a secret investigation of &#8220;subversive&#8221; activities under orders of Francis Perkins, secretary of labor.</p>

<p>This announcement aided conservatives in the General Tire Co. local of 1,000 to avert strike sentiment which had led the workers to vote by a 75 percent majority to walk out if the company didn&#8217;t agree to negotiate on seniority.</p>

<p>The prime purpose of the federal investigation is to answer the question, &#8220;Is there a radical element in control of the A.F. of L. in Akron and Ohio which is acting independently of the national officers and the executive council,&#8221; Miss Perkins admitted.</p>

<p>This latest move completes the offensive of the rubber barons to smash all progressive elements among the workers and enforce an open shop policy through terrorization.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>The Government &#8220;Survey&#8221;</h4>

<p class="fst">The government intimidation of the workers was first revealed in veiled hints by Hugh Friel, federal conciliator, when he spoke before the General workers, and he succeeded in temporarily frightening the union leaders.</p>

<p>Of course, when pressed for further explanation Friel attempted to add that a government survey of profits etc. was also part of the probe but this didn&#8217;t fool anyone.</p>

<p>The fact remains, clearly and openly, that the federal government is taking overt steps to crush the growing influence of the revolutionary elements among the increasingly class-conscious workers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many rubber workers do not yet realize the insidious attack can seriously cripple the recovery of the betrayed unions through the possible damage to the only hope of the workers, the party and the progressives.</p>

<p>It scarcely need be added that the A.F. of L. bureaucrats will join hands with the government in this dangerous attack.</p>
