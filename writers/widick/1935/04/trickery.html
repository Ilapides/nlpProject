<p class="fst">The railroading of the sell-out agreement arranged by Francis Perkins, Secretary of Labor and the A.F. of L. bureaucracy on Akron&#8217;s big three rubber workers&#8217; unions this week put to shame the lousy auto-code agreement or any other previous capitulation of William Green to President Roosevelt and his other agents of capitalism.</p>

<p>Twenty workers at the Goodyear local walked out, half-sick, half crying, Saturday, April 13, when they received a report that Green, Coleman Claherty (his rubber organizer) and the Goodyear, Goodrich and Firestone local presidents had signed an agreement in Washington which gave away the right to strike, didn&#8217;t abolish the company unions and left all jurisdiction in labor disputes to a government board, not yet selected and having no power to enforce its decisions.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Nothing Is Too Low</h4>

<p class="fst">While company union men jubilantly said, &#8220;Why it gives them nothing,&#8221; and the rubber barons smiled, an aroused rank and file prepared to fight the treacherous betrayal in the Sunday meetings. But they didn&#8217;t know to what depths the bureaucrats would stoop in an effort to smash the strike. They found out.</p>

<p>Claherty, red-faced and shifting uneasily from foot to foot, had scarcely finished reading the so-called agreement when a rank and filer at Goodrich, shouted, &#8220;Where&#8217;d you get the guts to bring back that god-damned sell-out to us?&#8221; to the thunderous applause of other workers. More criticism was hurled as Claherty retreated and finally sat down apparently defeated. His henchmen then began their work. Smooth tongues argued, &#8220;we must support our leaders,&#8221; and similar blather. It seemed to do little good. A vote was called. About one third of the Goodrich workers raised their hands in approval. The chairman said: &#8220;It evidently has passed.&#8221; No negative vote was taken after the meeting was over Goodrich workers walked out cursing, looking lost and humiliated. Claherty had &#8220;won over&#8221; the strongest local union.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>The Rout at Firestone</h4>

<p class="fst">Firestone was next. Shouts of betrayer, sell-out, down with the A.F. of L., bitter threats, more curses and eloquent speeches by progressives but to no avail. &#8220;Goodrich won&#8217;t walk out and you boys can&#8217;t do it alone. Why not be sensible. This is just a foothold, we&#8217;ll get more later.&#8221; Three hours of this and the Firestone workers gave up in disgust.</p>

<p>Goodyear workers were better prepared to meet the onslaught. Four days ago the progressives realized what would be done. They began organizing for a fight. Reports of the Goodrich meeting came in and inflamed the workers. The meeting began at the same time as Firestone&#8217;s. Regular business took an hour and then John House, president read the &#8220;agreement.&#8221;</p>

<p>A progressive from the rear immediately made a motion to repudiate the &#8220;agreement&#8221; signed. House ruled it out of order and said the approach would have to be a positive motion. He won.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>A &#8220;Bold&#8221; Faker</h4>

<p class="fst">Then a barrage by progressives placed throughout the hall sent House scurrying to cover. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bust any guy in the face that says I want this agreement or that I sold out. You boys decide this,&#8221; he temporized.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had 18 months of boards. This is full of loop holes, Claherty has betrayed us. This means proportional representation. We don&#8217;t want to depend on the government or Francis Perkins!&#8221; progressives argued while the Goodyear workers cheered them on.</p>

<p>A recognized progressive leader got up. He took the agreement from House&#8217;s hands. He could barely speak he was so indignant. He threw the agreement on the floor, &#8220;It&#8217;s not worth a damn. This is what I think of it.&#8221; Shouts of approval encouraged him ... then the telephone rang. &#8220;Firestone boys are giving in, looks like they&#8217;ll approve the agreement.&#8221; The speaker almost bawled; other progressives became sick in the pits of their stomachs. But they didn&#8217;t give up for a while.</p>

<p>However, after nearly two hours of denunciation, and when the progressives had exhausted their ammunition, a Claherty-ite took the floor. More promises, more &#8220;stick-by-the-leaders&#8221; and the government ... slowly the game became clear. Workers began to walk out, their faces dead set, the pain of betrayal was clearly evident.</p>

<p>When opposition began to die down, Claherty appeared &#8211; very nicely-timed entrance, of course. He pleaded eloquently as workers turned their faces in disgust. He winced when someone shouted &#8220;Betrayer,&#8221; but only momentarily. &#8220;The two locals used reason and you can&#8217;t go out alone,&#8221; he carefully began. Soon the demoralization crept in. Even progressives looked discouraged, lost in a dark labyrinth. The vote of approval passed by a small majority.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>The Specter of Black-Listing</h4>

<p class="fst">Workers left quickly after the meeting, shamefaced, disappointed, tears gleamed dimly in some eyes. A few brave workers openly charged, &#8220;dictatorship from the top,&#8221; although expulsion was imminent. Progressives went home as one goes to a funeral. The dark specter of company blacklists, the black shadows of betrayal, the laughs of company union men haunted them.</p>

<p>The A.F. of L. bureaucracy had negotiated an &#8220;agreement.&#8221;</p>
