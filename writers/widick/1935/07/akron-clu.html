<p class="fst"><strong>AKRON, Ohio, July 1.</strong> &#8211; Joining hands with William Green and other A.F. of L. bureaucrats in their latest &#8220;anti-red&#8221; drive, Frank Patino, president of the Central Labor Union here declared he not only supported Green&#8217;s move to split labor through mass expulsions but also began a campaign to oust local militants.</p>

<p>Patino, backed by the <strong>Summit County Labor News</strong>, announced his policy the day after the monthly meeting of the C.L.U. thus preventing an immediate reply by militants to his disruptive tactics.</p>

<p>It was the first open admission of Patino that he is with the A.F. of L. bureaucracy, although his previous actions in strikes had branded him as a hopeless, petty bureaucrat. His statement, widely featured in the labor paper, came three weeks after Coleman C. Claherty, rubber organizer, dragged the red herring across rubber workers&#8217; union meetings in an attempt to scare progressives.</p>
