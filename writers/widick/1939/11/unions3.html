<p class="fst">Fresh examples of how the labor bureaucracy becomes part and parcel of the war machine appear almost daily.</p>

<p>The Canadian section of the CIO announces its autonomy because it wants a completely free hand to aid the government for Britain.</p>

<p>The Canadian CIO leadership publicly declares it will do its part to help British imperialism keep over five hundred million colonial peoples in virtual slavery.</p>

<p>Chauvinism permeates the labor bureaucracy so deeply that it even wants to discard a semblance of internationalism expressed by the unity of the American and Canadian sections of the CIO.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Serve Masters</h4>

<p class="fst">British and French labor leaders are doing their best in the service of their capitalist masters. A special committee headed by Sir Walter Citrine, prominent British faker, and Leon Jouhaux, French sell-out artist, are going to confer monthly to work out a close solidarity of the workers in these two countries behind the war machines.</p>

<p>Mr. William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, doesn&#8217;t have to perform quite that openly yet for his masters. However, he is doing a fairly good job of warming up.</p>

<p>Naturally, Green would go after the militant workers who are fighting for their elementary rights, namely the autoworkers.</p>

<p>The crime of the CIO autoworkers, according to Green, is that they resorted to slow-down or sit-down strikes in protest against the terrific speed-up in the auto plants.</p>

<p>Of course, the effectiveness of the auto workers&#8217; tactics and their solidarity are what Green is really objecting to.</p>

<p>But there is something much more insidious in Green&#8217;s blast against the auto workers. After all, he always opposed militant action.</p>

<p>Green&#8217;s criticism of the auto workers in reality is a bid to the American war machine for becoming &#8220;the outstanding labor leader in war time.&#8221; That is, Green says in so many words, if you played ball with us we guarantee there won&#8217;t be any strikes. We&#8217;ll keep labor pacified. The CIO leaders won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>The whole purpose of the Green statement is to express his willingness to be the agent of the bosses and the military machine during war-time.</p>

<p>These examples serve to indicate what revolutionists mean when they classify the labor bureaucracy as agents of the capitalist class.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>But Not the Workers</h4>

<p class="fst">The attitude of the rank and file, however, is different.</p>

<p>The attitude of the rank and file on the question of war is not given any vocal expression because of the censorship and persecution.</p>

<p>A hint of how the British workers are reacting is contained in a brief dispatch telling the story of a young worker who was called before a special court after refusing to be drafted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a slave of the capitalist system. It is their war, not the workers. I refuse to shoot down my fellow workers, even though you line me up against a wall and shoot me,&#8221; the worker declared.</p>

<p>How many other unknown heroes of the proletariat are there in England, France and Canada? They are the real voice of the proletariat. The labor bureaucrats merely repeat their master&#8217;s voice.</p>
