<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/socialist-appeal-1939/index.htm#sa03_04" target="new">Vol. III No. 4</a>, 28 January 1939, p.&#160;4.<br />

<p class="fst">The best labor paper in America.</p>

<p>It is this prospect for the twice-a-week <strong>Appeal</strong> that makes the present campaign so vital to every trade unionist in and near the Party. Already the <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong> has made its mark in the union movement with lively articles on burning issues before the labor movement. Now, we have the possibility of becoming a powerful influence through the medium of our twice-a-week <strong>Appeal</strong>.</p>

<p>Nothing succeeds like success. Our Party can and will make, I am confident, an impressive record in the labor movement, especially through the expansion of our press. It signifies a giant step forward in building a mass base in the working class. It means that the &#8220;Trotskyites&#8221; are not only &#8220;here to stay&#8221; but are on the march. In this period of confusion, indecision, and &#8220;muddling through&#8221; by the C.I.O. and A.F. of L. top leaderships, our steady advance on the road of revolutionary socialism will serve to draw all advanced union militants in our direction.</p>

<p>The twice-a-week <strong>Appeal</strong> with spot news on strikes, on general labor developments, on the national and international issues that face the workers today, can become the best-read labor paper in America. It must become indispensable to every union militant. And when we hear the unionists say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with all the policies, but the <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong> certainly has the inside information and facts on everything, that&#8217;s why I read it,&#8221; then we know we will have broken through the ice and will be well on the road to a genuine mass proletarian party.</p>

<p><em>Build the Party in the unions through the twice-a-week <strong>Appeal</strong>!</em></p>
