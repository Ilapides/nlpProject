<p class="fst">Behind the headlines of the news that the Hollywood technicians
obtained a ten per cent wage increase from the movie producers is the
story of a long struggle conducted by rank and file movements within
the AFL unions there.</p>

<p>For nearly two years, the agitation among the membership of the
American Federation of Studio Workers, an affiliate of the
International Alliance of the Theatrical Stage Employees, rocked the
hide-bound conservatism of the union leadership.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Accuse &ldquo;Czar&rdquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">William Bioff, &ldquo;czar&rdquo; of the AFL unions in Hollywood,
was accused, among other things, of receiving a &ldquo;cut&rdquo; of
$100,000 from movie producers to keep the union in line.
Subsequently, his defense against the charge was that he had merely
borrowed the money.</p>

<p>Conditions in the AFL unions there created a basis for the entry
of the CIO through an industrial union. A National Labor Relations
Board election held this fall brought victory to the AFL partly
because Bioff announced a determination to obtain a wage increase for
all the employees, and actually did negotiate raises for 12,000
craftsmen in the industry.</p>

<p>Stimulated by this success, greater sections of the AFL membership
demanded wage increases. Negotiations began between Bioff and the
producers.</p>

<p>Failure of the movie producers to yield an inch brought the threat
of a strike, which could have enlisted the support of the entire
I.T.A.S.E. with 40,000 movie projection workers in 25,000 theatres,
tying up an industry of 250,000 employees.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Win Increase</h4>

<p class="fst">This threat brought a last-minute compromise which was accepted by
the union. A ten per cent wage increase was given to 23,000
technicians effective until Feb. 15, 1940.</p>

<p>The employers submitted the following written proposal to the
union:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;On or about Feb. 15, 1940 you will give us an
opportunity to show you that the condition of this industry makes a
continuation of wage increases impossible, and further to show you
that we have taken every step possible within our power to readjust
our business so as to make it possible to continue without recalling
these wage increases.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The movie employers hope to prove that the wages cannot be paid,
and thus the raises would be rescinded from the day they were put
into effect.</p>

<p>In event of a disagreement, an arbitration board will be agreed
upon with final decision in their hands. Of course, there will be
plenty of disagreement, since the union would hardly give up the
increases it has already won.</p>

<p>The pay increases mean a total of $3,000,000 more in wages for the
workers in one year. Because of the seasonal nature of present
employment the studio craftsmen actually earn only $900 a year, and
the raises are a good step forward.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A Shady Past</h4>

<p class="fst">During the negotiations the employers dug up an old conviction
against Bioff for which he has not yet served his time, in an effort
to discredit the union.</p>

<p>Actually, that conviction had nothing to do with unionism. Bioff
was convicted in 1923 in Chicago of collecting money from women in
the red-light section of the city.</p>

<p>Subsequently, he became the bodyguard of George Browne, president
of the I.A.T.S.E., during a bitter and bloody inter-union fight in
Chicago marked by a couple of mysterious killings.</p>

<p>From there he rose to vice-president of the union, a position he
now holds. He was connected with the attempted raid of the I.A.T.S.E.
on the Actor&rsquo;s Union this fall, an attempt that failed.</p>

<p>The AFL unions in the movie industry would be in a much stronger
position to defend themselves from the employers if the dictatorial
rule of Bioff were overthrown.</p>

<p>Perhaps the present victories of the union on the wage issue will
spur the rank and file movements in their struggle against the Bioff
leadership.</p>

<p>A house-cleaning from below rather than allowing the courts to
settle the question is the only progressive method of removing Bioff.</p>
