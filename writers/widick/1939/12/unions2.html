<p class="fst">The American labor movement is watching with considerable anxiety
the fate of the union movements in England and France in the present
war.</p>

<p>The facts of the situation in France have trickled into England
and also America, and the story of the strangulation of the French
labor movement is shocking. English unionists are wondering if the
same tragic lot is in store for them. American unionists are
confronted by similar thoughts.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Shop Stewards</h4>

<p class="fst">Daladier and the French military machine recently ordered the
abolition of the shop steward system, among other drastic decrees.
This is like cutting the heart out of a body and expecting it to
function.</p>

<p>The shop steward system has been recognized as the real life, the
heart, and the backbone of a good union. In France, the creation and
extension of the shop steward systems was one of the major victories
of the famous 1936 sit-down strike.</p>

<p>Protection for the rank and file on the job comes primarily
through the shop stewards. They negotiate and settle the day to day
grievances that constantly irritate the workers.</p>

<p>In addition to that vital function however, the shop steward
system in France was the basis for the workers committees that
virtually took power in 1936 &ndash; a fact that Daladier has not
forgotten.</p>

<p>Daladier seeks to kill two birds with one stone in his order
abolishing the shop steward system: break the backbone of the unions
and prevent the workers from having committees capable of functioning
in times of social unrest.</p>

<p>Daladier remembers too well how the shop committees became the
embryo Soviets in 1936. It is this eventuality that he tries to
block.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>War Taxes</h4>

<p class="fst">How much social dynamite is packed in the French industrial system
is indicated by two other decrees of the Daladier government. All
industrial workers have to &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; fifteen per cent
of their wages to a war chest, and 40 per cent of all overtime is
&ldquo;contributed&rdquo; to this fund.</p>

<p>Under the pressure of the rising costs of living on the one hand
and the cut in wages on the other hand, combined with longer hours,
speed-up, and accumulation of grievances, the French workers are
building up a terrific resentment that will turn into a gigantic
explosion. Not since the days of Louis Fourteenth have the French
ruling classes been sitting on such a powder keg.</p>

<p>Is it a wonder that the French Foreign Legion and other picked
colonial troops are &ldquo;judiciously&rdquo; distributed behind the
front lines?<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>England Too?</h4>

<p class="fst">The rank and file workers in England are worrying about the
probability that the Chamberlain government, with the approval of the
labor fakers, will further curtail the rights of the union movement
under the guise of war emergency measures.</p>

<p>Do they also face the signing of a pact between the government and
the labor bureaucrats which brings the application of compulsory
overtime and wage cuts, coupled with longer working hours? Are
concentration camps for militant workers, and forced labor under
military control the next step in England? And are the shop
committees in England going to be suppressed?</p>

<p>A story appeared last week that indicates how the English workers
are feeling. Union bureaucrats agreed with an industrial concern not
to press for the solution of certain grievances and a wage dispute.
However, the rank and file through the shop committee organized a
strike that was averted only with the greatest difficulty. The shop
stewards are still sore about the sellout. Orders from the union
bureaucrats are being disregarded. Another strike is threatened.</p>

<p>How many more of these events occurred which do not escape the
censorship? Undoubtedly many. The seeds of unrest are inherent in the
war production schedules.</p>
