<p class="fst">Those unionists who did not get stirred up about the Apex court decision which fined a C.I.O. union over one million dollars certainly got a real jolt this week.</p>

<p>Republic Steel&#8217;s suit against the C.I.O. for alleged damage of $7,500,000 awoke labor to the danger existing to its welfare in the present legal and court system.</p>

<p>The impudence of the Republic Steel company is matchless. Its notorious strike-breaking record, especially in the &#8220;Little Steel&#8221; strike, is well-known. Back in 1936 this company broke another strike. We remember vividly the company thugs rolling out of the plant in a huge armored truck, blasting away at the picket line with shot guns and tear gas, and then the clubbing that ensued.</p>

<p>This scab company finds a legal pretext to sue the C.I.O. Obviously the purpose of this move is to harass and worry the C.I.O.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Goodyear Gall</h4>

<p class="fst">Even more arrogant is the action this week of Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber company&#8217;s lawyers at the National Labor Relations Board hearings on charges made by Local 2, United Rubber Workers of America.</p>

<p>Goodyear has figured out a clever technique for using the N.L.R.B. hearings against the union.</p>

<p>The company stunt is based on the fact that the Supreme Court ruled sit-downs illegal. Goodyear is therefore claiming that the many sit-downs in its Akron plants not only were illegal but also hurt company business (which would legally call for damages.)</p>

<p>Goodyear&#8217;s reply to the N.L.R.B. charges was so bitter and threatening that it created a furor at the opening of the hearings.</p>

<p>Trial Examiner T.E. Dudley postponed the hearings for a week while he thought over the company attorneys&#8217; request to introduce evidence going back to the famous 1935 sit-down strike.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Interlocking Directors</h4>

<p class="fst">Leading capitalists on the Republic Steel Co. board of directors also are on Goodyear&#8217;s Board. Tom Girdler is an influential member of Goodyear&#8217;s Board. When the N.L.R.B. called the hearings on Republic steel it caught the company unprepared. In the Goodyear case, ample time was spent in preparing the case and above all, a smart set of lawyers were hired by Goodyear to handle the hearings. Republic Steel saw to this.</p>

<p>Akron&#8217;s leading anti-union firm, Thomas, Buckingham, Doolittle and Company, were hired to defeat the union. They know more about Akron labor history than the lawyers of the N.L.R.B.</p>

<p>The interlocking directorates of Republic Steel and Goodyear show another thing. The suit against the C.I.O. for $7,500,000, the fight of Goodyear at the N.L.R.B. hearings, the preparation for a suit against the U.R.W.A., all these anti-union moves come directly from Wall Street interests owning rubber and steel plants.</p>
