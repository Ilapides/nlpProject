<strong>Exploited: Migrant Labour in the New Global Economy</strong><br/>
<em>Zed, 2007, &#163;14.99</em></p>

<p class="fst"><strong>Exploited</strong> should be a basic reference for all those
concerned with economic, social and political aspects of migration
today. This short book contains a mass of information on migrants and
their role in the economies of Western Europe and North America. It
demonstrates that migration is essential to contemporary capitalism
and that, despite hostility towards immigrants, including official
campaigns of exclusion, they are an increasingly important part of
state strategy.</p>

<p>But this is also a frustrating book &#8211; one that hints at
explanations for the major contradictions in migration policy but
does not go on to examine them or tackle the biggest issue in
immigration policy, that of border control.</p>

<p>Shelley is a journalist with the <strong>Financial Times</strong> and has
used his access to its resources to great effect. He marshals up to
date information on numbers, patterns of movement, employer
interests, trade union interventions and, importantly, migrant
experiences. He shows that, as the process of globalisation has
accelerated, migrants, especially &#8220;illegal&#8221; or undocumented
workers, have become crucial to certain industries in Europe and
North America.</p>

<p>In the US, he notes, &#8220;illegals&#8221; account for 24 percent of all
farm workers, 17 percent of cleaning workers, 14 percent of
construction workers and 12 percent of those in food preparation.
These figures demonstrate that irregular migration is part of the
fabric of US capitalism. Shelley quotes a recent analysis to the
effect that demand for &#8220;illegal&#8221; labour is structural in
character; it is &#8220;deeply embedded&#8221; in the economy and in social relations.</p>

<p>So also in Europe. Here Shelley shows that exploitation of migrant
workers can be as systematic and cynical as under the most repressive
regimes of the Global South. Focusing on Britain, he demonstrates
that the state encourages employment of workers under conditions in
which they are denied elementary rights. At the same time, he
observes, politicians and officials encourage a &#8220;victim-villain&#8221;
discourse, targeting smugglers, traffickers and gangmasters as
responsible for criminal practices in which migrants themselves are
said to be complicit.</p>

<p>Shelley spells out what many researchers in the migration field
have long failed to do: that the state itself is part of a system
under which poor and vulnerable people are imported for the purpose
of exploitation under conditions of illegality or semi-legality.
Notwithstanding media campaigns in which politicians inveigh against
&#8220;bogus&#8221; refugees and illegal entrants, it is governments that
accommodate employer demands to restrict employment law.</p>

<p>In Britain, he points out, the much heralded Gangmaster Licensing
Act excludes companies that service food retailers, wholesalers and
caterers. These continue to pay paltry wages to workers who are
vulnerable to the threat of instant dismissal or deportation. There
is ample evidence that immigration officers and police collaborate
with employers, so that those who challenge their conditions may be
targets for dawn raids followed by imprisonment and deportation.</p>
<p>Shelley&#8217;s impressive data and sustained argument make this book
an important resource &#8211; but one that also raises a series of
unanswered questions. <em>Who</em> are the migrants moving in large
numbers to North America, Western Europe and other destination
regions? What leads them to travel long distances, undertaking
dangerous journeys? What is the relationship between their
circumstances in countries of origin and the strategies of those who
dominate the global economy?</p>

<p>Large scale migration is often associated with the <em>displacement</em>
of those involved. Sometimes this is the outcome of war, repression,
civil conflict or environmental crisis. When it is systemic and
continuous, however, we must look for other explanations. Industrial
capitalism has always required mass movements of people, usually from
the countryside, who can enter the waged workforce or become part of
a reserve of labour. As Marx observed in the case of Europe, the
early phases of capitalist development required active efforts to
dispossess rural people who could provide &#8220;requisite supplies of
masterless proletarians&#8221;.</p>

<p>Today large numbers of people in Africa, Asia, Latin America and
the Middle East are being displaced by the impact of neoliberal
globalisation. This is the outcome of 30 years of aggressive
&#8220;marketisation&#8221;, during which corporate capital has been
encouraged to operate freely in even the most vulnerable regions of
the Global South. Many economic and social reforms associated with
independence from colonialism have been reversed. Land reforms have
been revoked, welfare slashed, subsidies reduced or abolished. As
part of an ideological commitment to remove obstacles to free
movement of capital, the state itself has been forced into retreat.
Hundreds of millions of people have been driven closer to the margin
of survival and, when affected by conflict or specific economic or
environmental problems, many leave their homes in search for security
and stability.</p>

<p>Mexico presents a striking example of the problem. Mexicans have
been migrating to the US for over a century, but in recent years
numbers have increased enormously. The change is associated with
policies introduced though the North American Free Trade Agreement,
under which the Mexican state has been obliged to end guaranteed
prices for key agricultural products. Cheap American grain has
flooded the Mexican market; at the same time the <em>ejido</em>
system, under which for over 70 years peasants held collective rights
in land, has been modified to allow for its mortgage, lease or sale &#8211;
the beginning of a programme of rural privatisation.</p>

<p>Agribusiness has moved in, with corporations buying out debt-laden
peasants, using the courts to facilitate mass evictions, and
targeting vulnerable populations such as the indigenous people of the
south. Millions have left for Mexican cities or for the border with
the US, with the result that local arrangements for communal labour
have collapsed and that those remaining on the land have been
compelled to join the exodus.</p>

<p>One in every five rural households in Mexico is directly affected
by emigration &#8211; in some regions one in two. They are the source of
millions of &#8220;irregulars&#8221; who make up most of an unofficial
workforce now integral to US capitalism.</p>

<p>Similar developments are under way across the Global South. Tens
of millions of people are on the move. They are &#8220;survival migrants&#8221;
compelled to undertake journeys in which they risk all in order to
cross borders which are heavily policed but at which entry can be
guaranteed by payments to smugglers and to immigration officials who
are active agents within the system of irregular movement. Their
numbers dwarf recent legal migrations to Western Europe from
accession states of the European Union. The combined totals of
workers from Poland and the Baltic states who have appeared in
countries like Britain and Germany in recent years are a fraction of
those travelling to the US from Central America, or from Africa and
the Middle East to states of Southern Europe.</p>

<p>This is part of a global pattern that Shelley hints at but does
not investigate. While recognising the importance of &#8220;push&#8221;
factors in contemporary migration, and the hypocrisy of states eager
to exploit those affected, he does not ask about the role of the
latter in creating conditions that facilitate mass movements. He
concludes with a series of proposals for reform of migrant labour
policy: ending the criminalisation of &#8220;illegals&#8221; and regularising
their status; developing labour movement activity which draws them
into trade unions; and challenging discrimination and the
racialisation of such groups.</p>

<p>Shelley fails directly to address one of the issues with which he
opens the book &#8211; that of open borders. He writes tersely that
proposals for abolition of border control &#8220;make perfect sense&#8221;,
but this passing comment is not developed. In fact, as a series of
recent publications make clear, arguments for free movement are being
discussed more and more widely and with increasing urgency.</p>

<p>As more people undertake long and dangerous journeys in their
struggle to find security, governments eager to exploit them place
more obstacles in their way. More irregular migrants die in the
Arizona Desert, or on leaky ships in the Mediterranean or the Java
Sea. Those who make it to their destinations provide a vulnerable and
often compliant workforce &#8211; and a convenient target for ideological
offensives by politicians prepared to encourage populist campaigns
that result in detention and deportation, and which poison the wider
society by directing old prejudices towards new victims.</p>

<p>Migration policy is an area of the most extreme hypocrisy and
injustice. As neoliberalism stimulates displacement on a wider scale
(Kenya is just the latest example), more people will join millions
already on the move. A radical strategy is required. Perhaps Shelley
can follow his excellent <strong>Exploited</strong> by considering how we can
advance the argument for open borders.</p>
