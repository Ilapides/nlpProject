<p class="c"><em>The Hebron massacre in February was a truly awful reminder of
the racism that infests Israeli society. But these killings may be
remembered less for what they say about Zionism than for their
importance in accelerating the break up of Palestinian nationalism.
<strong>Phil Marshall</strong> reports</em></p>

<p class="fst">Palestinians were already sceptical that last year&#8217;s Washington
&#8216;peace&#8217; deal signed by PLO leader Yasser Arafat could bring any
benefits. When Israel refused to withdraw troops from Gaza and
Jericho, as it had promised, many Palestinians concluded that they
had been sold another phoney agreement. As a result, Arafat&#8217;s
authority was crumbling when the Hebron outrage took place; his
refusal to lead protests against the killings and his willingness to
renew negotiations with Israel has produced further fury among
Palestinian activists. Al Fatah, Arafat&#8217;s base within the PLO, is
now collapsing throughout the Occupied Territories.</p>

<p>The long predicted advance of Islamic activism is becoming a
reality as Hamas (&#8216;Zeal&#8217;) becomes the main attraction for
Palestinian youth. This was highlighted by the bomb attacks on
Israeli citizens carried out by Hamas recently.</p>

<p>Since Fatah launched its armed struggle against Israel in 1965
Yasser Arafat has been &#8216;Mr Palestine&#8217;, an apparently
irrepressible nationalist whose &#8216;survivability&#8217; guaranteed
loyalty among the mass of Palestinians. But Arafat&#8217;s obsession with
the Washington deal has driven many activists to despair.</p>

<p>While his PLO negotiators jet from Washington to Oslo, Paris and
Cairo, the Israeli army maintains a relentless repression to which
the people of the Occupied Territories are compelled to respond. At
the same time, conditions in the Gaza camps are worsening;
unemployment stands at 50 percent and repeated curfews prevent
migrant workers travelling to Israel.</p>

<p>Arafat has received clear signals that even the Fatah cadre have
had enough. In January Fatah lost control of the Gaza Engineers&#8217;
Association, a professional body which has been a bastion of PLO
support. For the first time Islamic candidates gained almost half the
vote. One activist in Gaza observes that Fatah has &#8216;imploded&#8217; &#8211;
that the political apparatus Arafat intended to use for his
proto-government under the Washington deal has largely disintegrated.
Fatah is likely to have serious problems assembling even a skeleton
administration for the &#8216;limited autonomy&#8217; zones it is due to take
over in Gaza and Jericho.</p>

<p>Radical nationalist opposition to Arafat has always been
ineffectual and has long since been overtaken by the Islamists. Hamas
has the advantage of being seen as relatively &#8216;clean&#8217;. Fatah
built its influence in part by buying loyalty, with the result that
its most influential members often lived well, taking comfy villas in
the wealthiest neighbourhoods. Although most Hamas leaders are also
middle class, they are far less ostentatious. Many of its cadres are
poor camp dwellers who have built a following amongst the &#8216;<em>intifada</em>
generation&#8217; &#8211; youth who were radicalised by the uprising which
began in 1987. These activists are now the core of Hamas&#8217;s
guerrilla organisation, which has become the strongest armed
Palestinian force, scoring a number of successes against the Israeli
army. According to the Israeli paper <strong>Al Hamishmar</strong>, Israeli
intelligence in Gaza is genuinely worried about Hamas and the
military command has decided that it must back Arafat in any
confrontation with the Islamists. It is Israel&#8217;s fear of Hamas&#8217;s
advance that seems finally to have prompted troop withdrawals from
Gaza and Jericho.</p>

<p>But how is an enfeebled PLO to combat the Islamists? As part of
the Washington deal Arafat was to assemble a Palestinian police force
which would, in effect, mediate Israeli rule in Gaza and Jericho,
targeting more intransigent elements such as Hamas. Such is the speed
of Fatah&#8217;s collapse, however, that by April no more than a few
hundred of the expected 25,000 trainees had been recruited.</p>

<p>One reason for this failure may be that Arafat&#8217;s coffers have
finally emptied. Between 1969 and 1990 Fatah received huge sums of
money from the Gulf states: in Saudi Arabia, for example, the state
provided its own funds for Arafat and levied a poll tax on every
Palestinian worker which was channelled directly to the PLO. The deal
was that the PLO would operate a principle of &#8216;non-interference&#8217;,
desisting from political activity within Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>The world economic crisis and a falling oil price hit all the Gulf
economies and by the late 1980s the PLO was feeling the pinch. But in
1990, when Arafat aligned with Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War, all
funds were cut off. In addition, many Palestinian workers in the
wealthiest states were expelled &#8211; in Kuwait they were hounded in a
sustained racist attack on the 300,000 strong community. Arafat lost
his financial lifeline and with it much of the PLO&#8217;s direct
influence in the Occupied Territories.</p>

<p>During the Washington peace talks last year the PLO was promised
huge sums to operate the new administration and start basic
development. The World Bank has since estimated that a minimum of
$2.4 billion is needed over five years; the PLO&#8217;s own Palestine
Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction wants 15 billion
dollars. To date, the PLO has promises of less than 250 million
dollars, of which almost nothing has arrived. Arafat cannot even
guarantee basic welfare &#8211; in December teachers at the Fatah backed
al-Aznar College in Gaza went on strike because they had not been
paid for seven months.</p>

<p>The PLO&#8217;s whole project for a semi-autonomous Gaza/Jericho &#8211;
an &#8216;Arafatistan&#8217; occupying less than a fifth of historic
Palestine &#8211; is in the balance. At the same time, a more coordinated
form of resistance to Israel is emerging across the Occupied
Territories. In January Islamic activists and radical nationalists
combined to reform the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising
(LTNLU) &#8211; the body which had coordinated the <em>intifada</em>. In
March UNLU responded to the Hebron massacre by issuing its first
leaflet, arguing for mobilisation against Israeli occupation
throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip &#8211; a call to relaunch the uprising.</p>

<p>Israeli repression may prevent an upsurge on the scale of 1987-88
but the Occupied Territories remain in a volatile state. Last year&#8217;s
talk of a &#8216;breakthrough&#8217; raised expectations which have been
dashed by Israel and Arafat&#8217;s feeble compromises. Events in Hebron
raised the temperature, provoking fury first towards Israel and then
at the PLO&#8217;s passivity. Yet most Palestinians cannot see a way
forward. Many view the PLO with a mixture of sorrow and disgust and
are drawn towards Hamas. But many are also rooted in a secular
politics which has combined Muslims and Christians in collective
action and is wary of the prescriptive formulas of religious
fundamentalism. The mass of Palestinians are not calling for <em>sharia</em>
law, rule by the clerics or restrictions on women&#8217;s dress &#8211; all
part of the Hamas programme which accompanies its call to free
Palestine from Israeli rule.</p>

<p>In Egypt at the moment the Islamic militants&#8217; assaults on the
Mubarak regime are combined with a communalism that promotes attacks
on the country&#8217;s large Christian minority, fatally disabling the
opposition movement. Such divisions among Palestinians would spell disaster.</p>

<p>In the face of the PLO&#8217;s retreat, Hamas may look an attractive
alternative, but across the Middle East political activists are
discovering that Islam divides as well as unites &#8211; and that in the
end it always compromises. There are already signs that if Arafat can
cobble together the means to run his micro-state in Gaza and Jericho,
there are sections of Hamas prepared to compromise in order to secure
a stake in power.</p>

<p>This reflects the roots of both the PLO and Hamas in the politics
of Arab capitalism, each organisation expressing the aspirations of
the Palestinian middle class to run an independent state, and each
tied to one or other of the Arab states. Thus for over 25 years Fatah
was in hock to Saudi Arabia; Hamas, with its ties to both the Saudis
and Iran, is similarly dependent on forces which are hostile to the
interests of the mass of Palestinians.</p>

<p>The PLO has failed, yet Hamas seeks to emulate Arafat by adding an
Islamic gloss to his strategy. In the crisis which faces Palestinian
nationalism a far more radical approach is needed, one based on the
prospect of challenging Arab capitalism as a necessary part of the
struggle against Zionism.</p>
