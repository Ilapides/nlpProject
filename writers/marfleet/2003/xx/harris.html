<strong>The Return of Cosmopolitan Capital: Globalisation, the State and War</strong><br/>
<em>IB Tauris, 2003, &#163;24.50</em></p>

<p class="fst">I read this book with a sense of increasing scepticism, becoming
incredulity. By the end I also felt indignation that the author could
claim to address &#8216;the old agenda of socialists&#8217; while advancing
theories of economic and political change which sit comfortably with
those of the most aggressive neo-liberals. <strong>The Return of
Cosmopolitan Capital</strong> is less a book about capitalism than an
apology for it, in particular for the ravages of globalisation.</p>

<p>Phil Marfleet has always written books crammed with information.
This one too contains a mass of data of real interest, especially on
the world economy before the coming of industrial capitalism. But
this material is incidental to the main plot &#8211; Harris&#8217;s account
of the changing relationship between the state and capital.
Developing an argument he began to set out in the early 1990s <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> he
suggests that for the past 500 years the most important feature of
world history has been a continuing struggle between merchants and
traders &#8211; the &#8216;cosmopolitan bourgeoisie&#8217; &#8211; and those who
operate territorial states. The kings, princes and politicians who
dominated states, says Harris, succeeded in subordinating world trade
networks to local control, inhibiting and distorting the positive
features of capitalist development. They misdirected productive
resources into war &#8211; hence Harris&#8217;s concern is with &#8216;the
war-making state&#8217;, with its waste and destructive power.</p>

<p>Much of the book is a detailed account of successive phases of the
struggle between commercial capital &#8211; seeking to move freely across
the globe &#8211; and the efforts of local states to compel the market to
serve their own ends. The war-making state is malign, argues Harris,
and it is only when its influence is diminished that the potentials
of capitalism can be realised. Globalisation, he maintains, is now
driving the state into retreat; in effect the era of states and of
war-making is reaching its end and the productive capacity of
capital &#8211; that is, capital as trade &#8211; an initiate a new period of global
well being.</p>

<p>Harris foresees &#8216;a new bourgeois revolution&#8217; &#8211; &#8217;the
establishment of the power of world markets and of businessmen over
the states of the world&#8217;. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> It is this that will serve the
interests of the mass of humanity, ending poverty and making &#8216;the
conditions of all consistent with the best&#8217;. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> The more there is
of uninhibited capitalism the more there will be prosperity and
harmony; the &#8216;return&#8217; of the bourgeoisie, released at last from
the tyranny of the state, will mark the moment of advance of the
many.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Super-globaliser</H4>

<p class="fst">The key contention here &#8211; that extension of the market brings
universal good &#8211; is awfully familiar. It can be seen in almost any
strategic document produced by the major transnational financial
institutions. In its report on the world economy, Entering the 21st
Century, the World Bank, for example, insists that full engagement
with world commerce is a requirement for the countries of Africa,
Asia and Latin America. According to the World Bank, &#8216;For
developing countries, trade is the primary vehicle for realising the
benefits of globalisation.&#8217; <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> Like the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organisation
(WTO), Harris believes that embracing the world market is the key to
economic and social advance. He is not just a globaliser, however,
but a super-globaliser. In common with pioneers of globalist theory
such as Kenichi Ohmae he maintains that states abuse the productive
capacities of capitalism. Ohmae argues that &#8216;the nation-state has
become an unnatural, even dysfunctional unit for organising human
activity and managing economic endeavour in a borderless world.&#8217;
<a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> But Harris believes that the state has always been
&#8216;dysfunctional&#8217; and that only when global capital has reconquered
the world of states can we look forward to an era of prosperity and harmony.</p>

<p>Harris sees the state as an incubus, an alien force that for
centuries has haunted the bourgeoisie, seizing and redirecting all
the potentials of commerce for its own interests. But the
relationship between capital and the state is far more complex than
is suggested by this struggle between good and evil. Since the
emergence of the nation-state it has been impossible to dissociate
the state as such from capital and from the agendas of capitalists.
To be sure, at various phases of capitalist development governments
have accommodated or strongly encouraged the commercial and
industrial bourgeoisies, while during other periods they have
restricted them. States have often been strongly identified with
private capital, while some dominated by the bureaucracy and the
military have set out to regulate capital in their own interests,
hence state capitalism. Even in this context, however, it is wrong to
see the state merely as an independent category, a political actor in
its own right. States have a class character-they are dominated by
men and women who have specific interests <em>vis-&#224;-vis</em> the mass of the
population and who mobilise resources to maintain their positions of
privilege. When the formal structure of the state changes, as in a
revolutionary upheaval, there may be a change in power relations to
the disadvantage of capitalists. In other cases, however, as with
recent developments in the former Soviet Union, many of those who
formerly enjoyed power have been able to retain positions of
privilege. The key issue is the actuality of class relationships.</p>

<p>Much of Phil Marfleet&#8217;s work in the 1960s and 1970s focused
directly on this issue. His analysis of Mao&#8217;s China, <strong>The Mandate
of Heaven</strong>, was a corrective to the approach of those who saw the
Chinese state as a new model of popular power. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> At a time when
many on the left were seduced by the rhetoric of China&#8217;s rulers &#8211;
by the idea of peasant uprisings, military means to power, and
&#8216;cultural revolution&#8217; &#8211; Harris examined the reality of class
relationships, concluding that a new bureaucratic state capitalism
had emerged. Curiously, <strong>Cosmopolitan Capital</strong> contains no
reference to <strong>The Mandate of Heaven</strong>, not even in a bibliography
which lists many of Harris&#8217;s publications. Not does it undertake
any analysis of class relations within a state or specific states;
rather it assumes &#8216;the war-making state&#8217; as an undifferentiated
category which is pitched in constant struggle against capital. How
shallow this approach is when compared to Harris&#8217;s earlier
insights.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Drive to war</h4>

<p class="fst">At several points in <strong>Cosmopolitan Capital</strong> Harris is at
pains to point out the shortcomings of the Marxist perspective. Marx,
he says, was &#8216;beguiled&#8217;, &#8216;wrong&#8217;, &#8216;misguided&#8217; &#8211; indeed
Marx and Marxists appear so often in the text that one begins to feel
that the author protests too much. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> But despite his ambitious
project &#8211; to provide a world history of relations between the state
and capital &#8211; nowhere does he suggest a alternative to the Marxist
perspective as a whole.</p>

<p>This is especially striking in relation to processes of change,
notably the crucial issue of the rise of industrial capitalism.
Harris asserts that this system emerged because those who controlled
the early centralised states of Europe wished for enhanced means to
wage war. They therefore directed local representatives of commercial
capital to use their resources for production of <em>materiel</em>: &#8216;The
heart of the national industrial system was the making of arms and
naval vessels, what ultimately became heavy industry.&#8217; <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> Long
periods of &#8216;manipulation&#8217; of private business by the state
consolidated industrial production and the special groups of
capitalists who were organised to sustain it. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> Industry, then, was
the outcome of the imposition upon merchants and traders &#8211; Harris&#8217;s
true capitalists &#8211; of priorities dictated by the state&#8217;s drive to
war. This is Harris&#8217;s challenge to Marx, to the idea that
capitalism grew organically within primarily agrarian societies and
that this process produced social and political upheavals which were
eventually settled in the interests of a new bourgeoisie. Harris
enquires rhetorically, &#8216;Was there then no &#8220;bourgeois
revolution&#8221;?&#8217; &#8211; and answers in the negative. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>Harris&#8217;s method is to pile up data on production for war and to
argue by assertion. The thousands of pikes, swords, muskets, cannon,
ships, lengths of rope, sail, chain, etc. demanded by Europe&#8217;s
princes to wage war on their rivals amount to evidence that the rise
of industry was driven by the monarchical state. Harris ignores those
who have examined other more fundamental processes at work within
European society in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. He has nothing
to say on changes in class relations within agrarian society. He is
silent on the growing impact of merchant capital, the spread of craft
industry, and the consolidation of urban-based production &#8211; here he
might have addressed the insights of Braudel, for example. What of
the political upheavals associated with these changes, notably the
English and French revolutions? The former hardly makes an appearance
except as illustrative material for the war-making thesis &#8211; the New
Model Army is a passing example of a novel type of military
formation. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> Events in France are described simply as &#8216;a monster
of popular nationalism&#8217;. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> Harris ignores the participants in
these epoch-making movements. They are simply irrelevant: what is
important is the volume of gunpowder, the number of wagons, the
tonnage of vessels required to support an escalating drive to war.
Harris has removed entirely the men and women who make history.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Nation-states</h4>

<p class="fst">In the Harris account the state is foisted upon the commercial
bourgeoisie. It is the state which misdirects the positive energies
of merchant capital, which indeed corrupts trade, destroying the
harmonious relations it has generated worldwide. As late as the mid
19th century, he suggests, commercial capital held out the promise of
a world integrated by the market: &#8216;Cosmopolitanism seemed to
promise a world without nationalism, provincialism and racism, a
world in which trade harmonised all.&#8217; <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p>On this view commercial capital has an unblemished record. It is
innocent of any active engagement with the state. To sustain this
idea Harris must again ignore the mass of literature which addresses
social and political change in Europe over some 400 years. There are
no peasant revolts, urban uprisings, movements for reform,
revolutionary crises &#8211; certainly none which engage the merchant
classes. History &#8211; as in the schoolbooks of an earlier era &#8211; is
the work of princes, kings and emperors. Like the rest of the
population, the commercial bourgeoisie is passive and credulous.</p>
<p>Consider the comments by Hill on the character of merchant capital
in England:</p>

<p class="quoteb">By the 17th century some merchants were as rich as peers,
though their fortunes were usually made in one lifetime. Such men
were quite independent of all but the government. They were busy
breaking down the privileges of local corporations where these
impeded; and they were using their wealth to reconstruct the society
in which they lived. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These men, and the lesser merchants and artisans, played a key
role in the English Revolution of the 1640s. They were active in
prolonged struggles against the Crown and in years of debate about
representation and legitimate authority. To paraphrase E.P. Thompson,
they were present at the making of the modern English state. They
were less coerced or &#8216;manipulated&#8217; by the state than instrumental
in shaping it.</p>

<p>The merchant class was not composed of innocents. It contested
both the old order and those movements from below which wished for
more radical outcomes &#8211; for example, it facilitated the deportation
of Leveller activists and later of Irish Republicans and dissenters
who refused to take an oath of allegiance to the new state. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> Eric
Williams notes that as a result of mass deportation the island of
Monserrat in the Caribbean &#8211; a mercantile enterprise &#8211; &#8216;became
largely an Irish colony&#8217;. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>There was a similar story during the revolutionary events in
France. Merchant capital was deeply engaged in constructing the new
order. It had blood on its hands &#8211; not only that of Louis and his
supporters but of the radical activists who demanded more rights than
the bourgeoisie was prepared to accommodate. The Republic, which was
to have a profound influence on national movements throughout the
19th century, was unthinkable without the engagement of the merchant
class. Like all capitalists they required both an apparatus of state
and an ideology of belonging which could assist in the struggle to
unite inherently unstable populations. They were architects of the
nation-state, the particular formation which has served capitalism so well.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Slavery</h4>

<p class="fst">For Harris it is the world-embracing activity of commercial
capital which is so distinctive. This, he argues, has been pursued
without the involvement of vulgar political constructions such as the
state. Such a view cannot be sustained.</p>

<p>Marx was the first to identify the relationship between
colonisation and the world market:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The discovery of gold and silver in America, the
extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal
population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East
Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial
hunting of black skins, signalled the rosy dawn of the era of
capitalist production. These idyllic proceedings are the chief
moments of primitive accumulation. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The first colonies were constructed upon slave labour. This was
indeed driven by the market, by the activities of commercial capital,
but it required more than an economic impulse. As Gai observes, the
merchants, traders, slavers and plantation owners needed &#8216;the
politicisation of space &#8211; an organised community, legislation of
the use of force, rules, adjudication, and ideology&#8217;. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a> The
colonising powers developed elaborate codes of ownership and means of
regulating disputes among traders and slave-owners. Core structures
of the state which had emerged in Europe &#8211; legal systems, judicial
institutions and means of enforcement &#8211; were reproduced in the
colonies as mechanisms which both guaranteed the rights of owners of
property and mediated relations among them. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> Here the colonial
enterprise was underwritten by states in which the merchant class had
a stake of its own.</p>

<p>The ruling families of Europe struggled to maintain control of the
monarchical state &#8211; and most eventually lost. They were also forced
to surrender their early colonial possessions. The states which
emerged reflected above all the interests and ambitions of commercial
capital. Many of the wealthiest people in Britain&#8217;s American
colonies were slave-owners or were closely associated with the trade,
among them leading activists of the independence movement. Samuel
Johnson, a strong opponent of slavery, observed, &#8216;How is it that we
hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?&#8217; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>The American traders and planters demanded a state adequate to
their specific needs. Blackburn comments that, &#8216;the most prominent
champions [of the American Revolution] included slaveholders and
carrying-trade merchants who looked forward to an unfettered advance
of the North American involvement in plantation agriculture.&#8217; <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a>
By the mid 19th century similar movements had broken up the Spanish
and Portuguese empires in Latin America &#8211; in less than 100 years power
relations across the Americas changed comprehensively, leaving local
merchant capital in an influential position. Rather than being
overwhelmed by an abstract, disembodied state, the real individuals
who made up the trading networks had engaged in flesh and blood
struggles which brought into being new national states which they
hoped would better serve their own interests.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&#8216;Buccaneers&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">By the late 19th century the US and most European governments were
attempting to regulate commercial capital much more closely. Even at
this stage, however, merchant adventurers played a leading role in
their own right. In an earlier era they had been the active element
in what Kiernan calls &#8216;private enterprise imperialism&#8217;, whereby
the state endorsed organisations such as the various East India
Companies. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a> During the 1870s and 1880s such activities were
resumed in Southern Africa, West Africa and China. In 1889 the
British South Africa Company was chartered, headed by the profiteer
Cecil Rhodes. He made vast sums from gold and diamonds, using much of
his fortune to finance land grabs which the British authorities were
pleased to endorse. When he created the colony of Rhodesia Europeans
flooded in &#8211; traders, speculators, carpet-baggers and &#8216;buccaneers&#8217;.
<a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a> Similar operations were conducted across the continent &#8211; there
was a British East Africa Company, a Royal Niger Company, a Deutsche
Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft. Their pioneering activities were
invariably associated with the drawing of new colonial boundaries and
the establishment of new states.</p>

<p>It was not clear, comments Porter, whether the state was &#8216;the
tool of mammon&#8217; or the capitalists served imperial interest, but in
many places diplomats and capitalists &#8216;were found suspiciously
together&#8217;. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> This observation sums up neatly the continuing
relationship between senior state functionaries and private
capitalists in general.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>World war and recession</h4>

<p class="fst">Why did the states of Europe launch the catastrophic wars of the
20th century? For Harris they are the product of state structures
themselves: &#8216;War was the very <em>raison d&#8217;&#234;tre</em> of the
nation, the sacred affirmation of its existence and superiority, its
historical validation, beyond all calculations of accident, let alone
profit and loss.&#8217; <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p>World wars were fought, Harris insists, because states were bound
to fight them. He is uninterested in precipitating factors, including
the specific conjuncture of global rivalries and the domestic
problems of European governments. More important is the industrial
character of the conflict: the number of artillery pieces produced,
shells fired, aircraft manufactured, vessels launched, men
slaughtered. In the case of the Second World War Harris is concerned
above all with the construction of the war economy &#8211; the activities
of states which declared for autarkic strategies in which &#8216;the
government made itself supreme&#8217;, bringing business as a whole under
close control and preparing for new conflicts. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a> This is perhaps
the most startling section of <strong>Cosmopolitan Capital</strong>, for the
drive to war takes place as if the greatest crisis in capitalist
history was merely incidental. The Great Depression appears as an
extrinsic factor, and the events of the 1920s and 1930s which
preceded and accompanied it &#8211; including revolutionary turmoil
across Europe &#8211; have no place in the story.</p>

<p>Harris does go to pains to examine the rise of fascism &#8211; or at
least one aspect of it. He is concerned to demonstrate that in
Germany the Nazis held no brief for big business. They were not a
party of capitalism; rather they were the ultimate creation of the
war-making state. He looks in detail at relations between Hitler and
the barons of German industry and concludes that &#8216;business was
reduced to being an instrument of the state, not at all the reverse.&#8217;
<a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> The precise relationship between the Nazi Party and business is
a matter of debate, but what is not at issue, surely, is that fascism
was a violent opponent of independent mass struggles. Its mission was
to bring order to a system in profound crisis &#8211; to destroy workers&#8217;
movements in evidence across Europe and especially assertive in
Germany. Reflecting the anxieties of capitalism in general &#8211; above
all of the fearful small capitalists &#8211; it waged war against the
movement from below. The &#8216;war-making state&#8217; was in this sense a
state that struggled to preserve capitalism by liquidating its most
potent enemies.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Globalisation</h4>

<p class="fst">It is with a sense of relief that Harris reaches the calm waters
of the post-war era. He notes the long boom of the 1950s and 1960s,
which &#8216;lifted almost all the boats, transforming the living
conditions, the style of life and the psychologies of millions of
people&#8217;. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a> If only such growth could be resumed, he suggests,
all would benefit.</p>

<p>For Harris globalisation offers this very possibility. Over the
past 30 years, he proposes, capital has defied the best efforts of
states to continue regulation. New networks of exchange have eroded
national boundaries, bringing together physically distant regions,
promoting new efficiencies and seeding prosperity across the
continents. The agent of this transformation is trade: &#8216;inexorably
world markets, step by step, are adjusting political behaviour and
responses, creating, all unseen, a new world order.&#8217; <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p>If only governments would understand. Their participation could
speed progress, serving the interests of all. But many, Harris
suggests, are stuck in the past. They continue to see the state as a
means to personal advance and influence, they are mere &#8216;rent-seekers&#8217;
clinging on to power at the cost of the majority. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a> Third World
governments unable to reform bear responsibility for the
consequences. The crisis in Africa, for example, is an outcome of the
failure of its rulers to allow the market to dictate the pace of
change. Here regimes were &#8216;too late to change and so unwilling to
abandon the national capital project&#8217;. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> Africa could have
learned from market-led policies in other parts of the world; instead
its people are saddled with corruption and with rulers who may be no
more than &#8216;military mafia&#8217;. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>Harris is shameless. He writes off centuries of ruthless
exploitation of sub-Saharan Africa &#8211; not just slavery, European
settlement, and the colonial state, but generations of
one-dimensional &#8216;development&#8217; which have produced vulnerable
monocultural economies. The role of the latter has in fact been to
satisfy the demands of commercial capital &#8211; the heroic figures of
Harris&#8217;s world narrative. To assure the flow from Africa of coffee,
cocoa, cotton, copper, diamonds and much more, Western governments
have endorsed regimes prepared to do their bidding. They have bought
up a whole generation of rulers, or where this has proved difficult,
created them. The rivalries built into colonial states have been
exploited to ensure instability &#8211; arms have poured in and all the
while crops and minerals vital to production in distant parts of the
world have flowed out. The great trading multinationals have made
merry while hundreds of millions of people have been pushed to the
margin of survival &#8211; or beyond.</p>

<p>On his account transnational institutions which have led the
offensive are not guilty. Their agendas, says Harris, have had no
impact on a process &#8216;driven by markets&#8217;. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a> At this point one
feels that Harris is commenting on events in another galaxy: is he
unaware of the pressures exerted on governments which baulk at
Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs)? Is there no relationship
between arms deliveries to Third World rulers and the latter&#8217;s
willingness to crush opposition to IMF reforms?</p>

<p>Harris ploughs on, blaming the Third World in general and Africa
in particular for an inability to change. This is the Washington
consensus &#8211; the view that attributes failures of development to an
imperfect alignment with the world market, the task being to
neutralise or remove recalcitrant elements, drive back the state and
open local economies to the proper disciplines of competition. It is
difficult to see what separates Harris from the strategists of the
World Bank, the IMF or the WTO. For several years he has worked as a
World Bank consultant: does this account for his attachment to their
ghastly creed?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Riots</h4>

<p class="fst">Harris writes as if resistance to market-led policies has been
restricted to unco-operative governments &#8211; local &#8216;mafia&#8217;. He
has not noticed that since the IMF introduced its first SAP in the
mid-1970s, there have been hundreds of mass protests involving
hundreds of millions of people. According to Walton and Seddon,
between 1976 and 1992 alone there were almost 150 such events &#8211; by
the 1980s they had become so common they were routinely described as
&#8216;IMF riots&#8217;. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a> Many forced governments and the IMF into
retreat &#8211; to reinstate food subsidies, fixed prices or emergency
food stocks. Were the participants simply perverse: should they have
accepted the discipline of the market and paid the higher prices?
Should they have starved?</p>

<p>Harris likewise ignores the emergence of the anti-capitalist and
anti-globalisation movements. His sole reference to the phenomenon is
to compare the protesters of Seattle with J.M. Keynes. Neither, he
comments, wished to be at the mercy of world markets; both have
pursued the illusion that states can intervene to ameliorate their
effects on the mass of people. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> The collective has no role in bringing change; rather we must place our faith in new bodies which
have appeared in the wake of the retreating state &#8211;
non-governmental organisations (NGOs). They constitute &#8216;all that is
left of a fundamental critique of modern society, but also the
beginning of a global political forum that reaches well beyond the
conventional circle of world power and influence&#8217;. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a> Some NGOs do express democratic sentiments &#8211; but most do not and are indeed
part of the problem.</p>

<p>Harris closes his book with another appeal to the liberating
powers of capital. The &#8216;real bourgeois revolution&#8217; is on its way,
he intones. Echoing Adam Smith he promises that &#8216;the unknown &#8211;
and unintended &#8211; outcome of market transactions&#8217; is to be the
guarantee of universal well-being. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a> The evidence is already with us: war, Harris says, is a thing of the past and only minor local
conflicts remain to be resolved. Oh dear! &#8211; has he noticed those
little problems in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and the promises of
conflicts in Syria, Iran, Korea? The state appears to be fighting fit
&#8211; and fighting for profit, clearing the way in Iraq for Bechtel,
Halliburton and Exxon. As before, politicians and capitalists are
&#8216;found suspiciously together&#8217;. It is the same old imperialism.</p>
<p>Unlike Harris vast numbers of people worldwide believe that the
world is a more dangerous place &#8211; and fortunately they are prepared
to do something about it.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f7" name="n7">7.</a> Harris&#8217;s work still shows the influence of the Marxist
perspective within which he produced his early work. Unexplained
references to combined and uneven development and to state capitalism
may puzzle readers of <strong>Cosmopolitan Capital</strong> who are unfamiliar
with the work of Leon Trotsky and of Tony Cliff.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f13" name="n13">13.</a> As above, p.&nbsp;86.</a> Can Harris really mean that the merchant capitalists of the Atlantic slave trade and those who plundered India
and later Africa were making &#8216;a world without nationalism ... and
racism&#8217; &#8211; a world of harmony? They were in fact leading actors in
constructing racism, inexplicable without the colonial experience in
general and that of enslavement in particular.</p>
