<h1>Save <em>The Militant</em></h1>

<h3>(January 1933)</h3>

<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1933/index.htm#tm33_02" target="new">Vol. VI No. 2</a>, 14 January 1933, p.&#160;1.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">In a previous issue the National Committee addressed an appeal to all members and to all friends and comrades of <strong>The Militant</strong> calling attention to the great danger which now threatens out weekly organ. It was said frankly in that appeal that unless drastic measures are taken immediately the success which we have had thus far in maintaining the weekly will end with its collapse. This needs to be reiterated with all possible emphasis and to carry the addition that with this issue our financial conditions have become yet more acute.</p>

<p>It is no longer sufficient to speak of maintaining the weekly <strong>Militant</strong> in its regular appearance, the problem now is to SAVE <strong>THE MILITANT</strong>. In the solution of that problem all our comrades, all our friends and sympathizers, must take part. It is a serious task. It is an important task. It holds out no promise of personal rewards but it demands some real revolutionary sacrifice. That is what we request of you and we feel certain that such a request will not be addressed in vain to the members and supporters of the Left Opposition. We know that you have the will to display such a spirit of sacrifice and where the will exists the way can be found.</p>

<p>You comrades, who have followed <strong>The Militant</strong> from week to week in its struggle for the Leninist path, fully appreciate the importance of saving our organ and again lodge it upon a more solid financial foundation. That the significance of its role increases from day to day, has been amply illustrated by all experiences so far. But the past will appear small compared to its future role and for that we must prepare.</p>

<p>To SAVE <strong>THE MILITANT</strong> the National Committee has launched a concentrated national campaign to collect a special fund of $1,000.00, apart from the regular income of the organization. This campaign is under way. It is to terminate March 1, 1933. A number of comrades have already come forward with their contributions. We know it represented a sacrifice on their part and we know that they will help further. We most say also in all seriousness that the number of comrades participating in the contributions to date is entirely too small and has not yet at all reached the point of diminishing the danger to our weekly organ. Because of this we count firmly upon the added support of all of you who read this appeal. We expect you to put your shoulders to the wheel, we expect you to help.</p>
