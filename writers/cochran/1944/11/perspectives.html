<p class="fst">The outbreak of the second world war did not catch us by
surprise. We knew that without successful socialist revolutions, it was
inevitable. We knew it was coming. We predicted it. And by our whole
rounded political struggle, for our principles and our organization, we
had steeled a cadre. We had prepared for the imperialist war. We were
ready.</p>
<p>But right in our own party, the strongest, the best organized
Trotskyist party, with the most tempered and experienced leadership,
right in our own party, the Shachtmanite petty-bourgeois section of our
leadership and membership buckled and folded up under the pressure of
bourgeois public opinion the minute war broke out; unceremoniously
abandoned the program to which they had promised to remain loyal and
true and for which they had promised to fight come what may; abandoned
the program of the Fourth International and attempted to engineer a
split throughout our movement. We survived the fight with the
petty-bourgeois opposition and emerged out of that fight stronger,
healthier, more homogeneous, a more disciplined, a more effective
party. Comrade Trotsky and we fought that fight as the steward of the
whole International movement. We were able to assume this
responsibility because we still enjoyed a measure of democracy, and
could conduct the struggle in thorough-going fashion right to the end.
We went into the war period with no illusions, with our eyes wide open.
We knew that we, like the other Trotskyist parties, would be
temporarily isolated. And we attuned our tactical orientation, we
adjusted our tactics for the uphill pull in our political propaganda,
our literary and organization activities, our trade union work. We
didn&#8217;t change our program, we didn&#8217;t alter, much less abandon our
principles. We merely adjusted our tactics, as realistic
revolutionists, as Leninists always do. We knew that the fumes of war,
the hypnotic spell of &#8220;national unity&#8221; would not long prevail. While at
first, the war may halt the radicalization of the masses, may adversely
affect the revolutionary process, it would soon impart to it a powerful
impulse. Trotsky pointed out to us again and again that this war was
not merely a continuation of the last one; that many factors were now
more favorable from the point of view of the revolutionary vanguard;
that the economic position of all the imperialist states, including the
US was infinitely worse today; that the democratic and pacifist
illusions of the last war were to a considerable extent absent; that
the experience of the first world war did not pass without deeply
affecting the masses.</p>
<p>We were able to proceed in our revolutionary work with patience,
with tenacity, with confidence, because we kept our perspective, we
kept our heads. We did not lose our nerve. We knew that life was
working in our favor.</p>
<p>In this, our movement was unique. I am not referring here to the
sell-outs of the Social Democrats and the Stalinists. In contrast to
the last war, nobody was surprised or caught off-guard by the betrayal.
We had anticipated this treason and had taken it into account in
formulating our plans. I am now referring to the petty-bourgeois
hangers-on, to the fellow travelers of the revolution. The retreat of
the left-wing intellectuals from Marxism was converted into a
precipitous flight. They madly rushed onto the bandwagon of the
imperialist war. Darkest pessimism reigned supreme in all the left-wing
intellectual circles, as well as the <em>emigr&#233;</em> groups.
Some thought that Hitler&#8217;s victories were definitive; that Europe had
slipped back to the dark ages; that the revolutionary movement had been
irretrievably defeated; that Europe, that all suffering humanity would
have to begin the long, painful climb over again. Others saw in
Hitler&#8217;s victories proof that a new class of managers, of bureaucrats,
had emerged; that the new form of society superseding dying capitalism
would not be socialism, but bureaucratic collectivism, the managerial
society, that the Marxist program had proved a Utopia.<br />

&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A Feeling of Blackest Pessimism</h4>
<p class="fst">In all these intellectualistic petty-bourgeois circles
there reigned, as I said, a feeling of blackest pessimism. The picture
was all dark and hopeless. And, of course, the petty-bourgeois quacks
and fakes of the Shachtman group, veering like a weather vane in
response to the pressure and mood of bourgeois intellectualdom, these
fugitives from Bolshevism proclaimed in their turn that the clock of
history had been set back so far that the political scene in Europe
would be dominated by the fight for national liberation and bourgeois
democracy. We were back in the nineteenth century! This pressure was so
strong, this mood of defeatism was so pervading, that it found its way
even inside the ranks of the Fourth International. A group of German
refugee comrades published a document called the <em>Three Theses</em>,
a thoroughly revisionist document, a thoroughly anti-Marxist thesis,
which took for good coin Hitler&#8217;s boasts that his &#8220;New Order&#8221; would
last centuries. They too thought that Europe was thrust back a hundred
years, that the working class had lost its preeminent role and must
dissolve itself in the middle class in the fight for &#8220;a national
democratic revolution.&#8221; Stripped of its verbiage and theoretical
 &#8220;profundities,&#8221; what was implied here was the necessity of new Peoples&#8217;
Fronts to fight for &#8220;bourgeois democracy.&#8221; We decisively rejected this
defeatist, this revisionist, this liquidationist &#8220;theory&#8221; at our last
convention in 1942. We set our course on the perspective of the rise of
the proletarian revolution.</p>
<p>The disorientation, the defeatism, the abandonment of the Fourth
International program on the part of the German emigre comrades came
about because they had lost all revolutionary perspective. They
proclaimed the battle that had not yet started, already lost. We base
ourselves on the rising working class revolution. They consider the
European revolution already defeated.</p>
<p>We knew that out of the war would come a gigantic revolutionary
explosion, above all in Europe, and we were confidently preparing for
it. And less than a year after our 1942 convention, Italian fascism
crashed to the ground. We saw in the downfall of Mussolini and the
beginning of the Italian revolution the most striking confirmation of
our analysis and program, and by the same token, an annihilating
refutation of all the theories and speculations of our enemies. We
immediately proceeded in our press to subject the Italian events to a
thoroughgoing analysis and point to the road ahead.</p>
<p>We found no special difficulty in writing our plenum resolution on
the European revolution, its perspectives and its tasks, any more than
we found any special difficulty in analyzing the Italian events in our
press. Do you know why? Because we were proceeding from a fundamental
analysis. The Italian revolution represented for us merely the last
link of a long chain that we had already wrought. We didn&#8217;t have to
hunt for some new formulas. We didn&#8217;t have to devise new principles. We
didn&#8217;t have to improvise, or proceed empirically from one step to
another. We knew the answers ahead of time. I don&#8217;t mean the answer for
every concrete problem that came up from day to day. There are no
blueprints of that kind. But we had the general strategical answer and
we understood the general trend and direction and meaning of the events.</p>
<p>Lenin, Trotsky and others established 30 years ago that capitalism
on a world scale, and that European capitalism in particular, was no
longer expanding but contracting. Its absolute decline had begun. In
addition to the internal decline, the capitalist states of Europe were
suffocating, because every one of them was hemmed in behind tariff
walls and artificial state boundaries. The huge standing armies were
eating up the substance of Europe&#8217;s wealth. The national state had
become a reactionary fetter upon the economy of Europe. The first world
war was itself testimony that European capitalism was in a blind alley.
The war destroyed Europe&#8217;s hegemony, it impoverished the continent, and
left it weak and debt-ridden, accelerating its decay. Economic hegemony
had definitely passed into the hands of the richer and more powerful
American imperialism. The war further disunited and dismembered Europe,
further exacerbated its trade rivalries. The Versailles treaty created
17 new national states, raised up new gigantic tariff walls and further
increased the standing armies.</p>
<p>The blind alley into which European capitalism was thrusting the
peoples was answered by the October revolution of 1917, which wrenched
one sixth of the earth&#8217;s surface out of the grip of capitalism and
opened up the revolutionary era in Europe. The fierce, sanguinary,
class struggles that swept Europe from one end to the other further
weakened capitalism, further hastened its decline.</p>

<p>In contrast, American imperialism was still rising. Wall Street
which had entered the war as a debtor emerged as a creditor. In
addition to its tremendous material preponderance over Europe, American
imperialism still enjoyed &#8220;national unity&#8221; at home. As against a Europe
torn by revolutionary struggles, the US was the home of class
collaboration par excellence.</p>
<p>Now all this is not some new revelation which our National Committee
thought up just the other day. This analysis was made by Trotsky 20
years ago and was adopted at that time as the official position of the
Communist International. Trotsky wrote:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;... the staggering material preponderance of the US
automatically excludes the possibility of economic upswing and
regeneration of Capitalist Europe. If in the past it was European
Capitalism that revolutionized the backward sections of the world, then
today it is American Capitalism that revolutionizes over-mature Europe.
She has no avenue of escape from the economic blind alley other than
the proletarian revolution, the destruction of the tariff and state
barriers, the creation of the Socialist United States of Europe.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">And further:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;American Capitalism in driving Europe more and more
into a blind alley, will automatically drive her onto the road of
revolution. In this is the most important key to the world situation.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">It is this fundamental twin concept: Lenin&#8217;s concept
that we live in the epoch of wars and revolutions and Trotsky&#8217;s
analysis of the relationship between America and Europe that has guided
our struggle all these past years.</p>
<p>By 1923, the revolutionary wave, evoked by the October revolution of
1917, receded. The defeat of the revolution in Germany in 1923 marked
the turning point, and made possible the stabilization of Capitalism in
Europe. The US came in with its Dawes plan, its loans and credits, and
buttressed the shaken Capitalist system. But this very stabilization
and the upturn in European economy that followed was on a far lower
foundation than before 1914. This so-called stabilization proved of a
not very enduring nature. This very stability was extremely unstable.
Only six years later, a catastrophic economic crisis struck US
imperialism, the largest, the strongest, the &#8220;healthiest&#8221; imperialist
power of the whole world.</p>
<p>And it was not very long before all of Europe&#8212;all of the world &#8212;
was again writhing in the grip of crisis. For ten years Europe was
gasping and choking. The consuming economic crisis was only interrupted
now and then by pitiful cyclical rises followed by new depressions. But
the crisis itself was never overcome. The crisis again sharpened the
class struggles, first of all in Germany, which was thrust into a new
revolutionary situation. The question was sharply posed: either Fascism
or Socialism. There was no third alternative. Through the base
treachery of the Stalinist and Social Democratic leaders, the
revolutionary situations were all dissipated and the potential
revolutions aborted, one after another, first in Germany, then Austria,
then France, then Spain. The Capitalists were permitted to regain the
upper hand; the path was cleared for their plunging the masses of
Europe and soon all humanity into the bloody maelstrom of the Second
World slaughter.</p>
<p>And even super-powerful, super-rich, super-stable American
Imperialism&#8212;the US&#8212;where they thought they had exorcized the class
struggle, where they thought Marx had been refuted by Henry Ford, even
this colossus writhed and twisted and shook for ten years in the toils
of terrible economic chaos. For ten years Wall Street tried every
device to overcome the crisis, but found that it could not extricate
itself from the contradictions of decaying world capitalism. Finally it
too plunged into the war with the aim of crushing its rivals and
establishing its own world domination. It sought to solve the crisis by
its exploitation of the peoples of Asia, of Africa and even of Europe;
by making Wall Street the center of world tribute. American imperialism
had reached its heydey and was already moving into its period of
decline at a far faster tempo than any previous imperialism.</p>

<p>The crisis at home gave birth to the modern trade union movement,
the largest, the best organized, the most volcanic trade union movement
in the world. The class struggle, far from having been exorcized,
emerged in America in full fury. Its young militant working class had
not tasted defeat; it was vigorous, full of confidence and moving
leftward.</p>
<p>In the last war, Europe lost its hegemony to America. But Europe is
losing its very independence to America in this war. Europe&#8217;s decay was
accelerated as a result of the first world war. But Europe is prostrate
and ruined as a result of this one. America could stabilize Capitalism
in Europe after the last war on a lower foundation and could permit its
revival within sharply defined limits. American imperialism can enter
and is entering Europe today with no other program but its
dismemberment, its despoliation, to prevent Europe from reviving to a
competitive level, to reduce Europe to a semi-colony, a vassal of the
Wall Street banks ... (Here follows a discussion of Wall Street&#8217;s
political program, bourgeois democracy, and the position of Morrow and
Logan. See Frank&#8217;s Speech in December 1944 <strong>Fourth International</strong>.)</p>
<p>Once we understand the trend of events correctly; once we have a
correct analysis of the European situation, a correct understanding of
the nature and role of American Imperialism, a correct appraisal of the
European revolution, then our answers, our programmatic tasks, fall
into their proper place. They are properly guided.</p>
<p>Our program for the European proletariat is the program of the
October revolution, the program of Lenin and Trotsky in 1917, the
program of the Socialist revolution, of the dictatorship of the
proletariat, of the Soviet power.</p>
<p>Our central unifying slogan is the Socialist United States of
Europe. This is the revolutionary answer, the only alternative to the
imperialist scheme of Balkanizing Europe and enslaving its peoples. It
corresponds to the experiences and needs of the European masses, who
are learning that it is necessary to destroy the reactionary and
outlived state boundaries, and that only through the economic
unification and socialist collaboration of the free peoples of Europe
can the menace of recurrent devastating wars be abolished and freedom
and economic well-being assured.</p>
<p>Our instrumentality to lead the revolution is the Bolshevik party.
Lenin taught us the kind of party the working class must have to make
the revolution.</p>
<p>Our basic tactics to mobilize the masses and lead them forward to
the revolution we have likewise learned from Lenin and the October
Revolution. These tactics have been carefully studied by our movement
over a great number of years. They have been enriched and refined
through the study of their application, or more often, their lack of
application, in the revolutions in Germany, Austria, Italy, France,
Spain, China and elsewhere.</p>
<p>This work of careful preparation and training, of mobilizing the
Trotskyist cadres for the revolutionary tasks ahead was crowned in 1938
with the holding of the Founding Conference of the Fourth
International, right on the eve of the second world war. This
conference adopted a world program for the present epoch. It is not
merely a restatement of socialist doctrine and fundamentals, but the <em>tactical</em>

program showing how the Fourth International must proceed to mobilize
the masses for revolutionary purposes and win them to the banner of the
Fourth international.</p>
<p>Trotsky, the author of this document, approached the whole question
from <em>this</em> point of view: economically, he said, the world is
ripe and over-ripe for the proletarian revolution, for Socialism.
Capitalism in every sphere is disintegrating and sees no way out. The
proletariat, in millions of masses, again and again moves onto the
revolutionary road. But each time it finds itself blocked by its own
conservative leadership. <em>The crisis therefore is one of leadership</em>.
A new leadership, adequate to the revolutionary tasks at hand, must be
created. This means the Fourth International, this small cadre, must
find its way to the worker mass.</p>
<p>But how? <em>By a program of transitional demands</em>. The present
epoch, said Trotsky, is distinguished not for the fact that it frees
the revolutionary party from day-to-day work, but because it permits
this work to be carried on indissolubly with the actual tasks of the
revolution. We do not discard, said Trotsky, the old &#8220;minimum&#8221; demands;
we defend the democratic rights and social conquests of the workers,
but we carry on this work within the framework of our revolutionary
perspective, and that is why the old minimum program is now <em>superseded</em>
for us by the transitional program, the tasks of which lies in <em>systematic
mobilisation of the masses for the proletarian revolution</em>.</p>

<p>Now the job today in Europe is to take <em>this</em> program and <em>apply</em>
it. In our opinion it is not necessary to hunt around for some new
program, or new tactical schemes. <em>We need only apply the <strong>Transition
Program of the Fourth International</strong></em>. Of course, a program
is not a blue-print, it is not a cure-all. You cannot become a master
strategist of the revolution merely by memorizing a lot of slogans and
rules, any more than you can become a master surgeon by memorizing the
best text book on surgery. Other things are necessary. You must have
experience. You must have talent. You must have the ability to
correctly gauge and appraise a situation, to know what it is necessary
to do at the particular moment. You must have the courage and heart of
a revolutionary fighter to withstand all pressure and attacks from the
camp of the enemy. You must have all of these things. But many of these
things are beyond the scope of resolutions and cannot be supplied or
imparted by resolutions. A resolution has got to provide a <em>line</em>.
If it does that, if it provides <em>a correct line</em>, it is a good
resolution, it does the job.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Transition Program</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>The revolutionary party will win the confidence of
the masses by its struggle for the program of transitional demands. Our
transitional program does not have a propagandistic character but is
invested with burning importance in Europe today. That means that the
bridge to the fundamental slogans can be more or less rapidly crossed
and that all immediate, minimum, democratic demands are of necessity
intertwined with the transitional ones, the essence of which is
contained in the fact, explained Trotsky, that they are directed ever
more openly and decisively against the very bases of the capitalist
regime</em> ...</p>
<p>The revolutionary party that today has the firmness and strength to
fight for its principles; to resist the pressure of bourgeois public
opinion, which inevitably bears down in merciless fashion on the
revolutionary vanguard; the party which resists the &#8220;temptation&#8221; to win
the masses &#8220;the easy way&#8221; by watering down its program, will on the
morrow have the opportunity of becoming the revolutionary leader of the
masses. Because the masses want a decisive change, because they thirst
for a genuine revolutionary leadership, because the catastrophic crisis
is driving the masses ever more fiercely onto the revolutionary road.
And as they grow disillusioned with their present misleaders, they will
turn to the parties of the Fourth International.</p>
<p class="c">* * *</p>
<p class="fst">We don&#8217;t have to say anything new about our <em>programmatic</em>
position on the Soviet Union. That question was so thoroughly discussed
and so magnificently illumined by Comrade Trotsky during our debate
with the Shachtmanite petty-bourgeois opposition, that it retains all
of its validity to this day in its <em>basic</em>, in its <em>fundamental</em>
features. The Trotskyist position on the Soviet Union, an integral part
of our world program for the world revolution, is the only position
that has been vindicated by the events, that has proved its correctness
in the struggle that provided correct guidance to the revolutionary
vanguard through all the mazes, twists and turns of capitalist
diplomacy, of war, of changing alliances and the like. All the other
programs on the Soviet Union have already been consigned by events
themselves to the dust heap.</p>

<p>Take as an example the most pretentious of the theories on the
Soviet Union&#8212;Burnham&#8217;s theory of the managerial society. Burnham&#8217;s
book, <strong>The Managerial Revolution</strong>, you may recall,
enjoyed a passing vogue among capitalist executives, government
bureaucrats and renegades from Marxism, both in the United States and
England. Burnham told us that the proletariat did not possess
sufficient inner strength to reorganize society on socialist
foundations and that a new class of &#8220;managers&#8221; was emerging which would
supersede dying capitalism and take over the helm to form a new
exploitative class. On the basis of this theory, Burnham had no
difficulty in foretelling that Stalin and Hitler, the two main
representatives of this new class of &#8220;managers&#8221; which was destined to
emerge all over the world, were united by an &#8220;affinity of ideologies&#8221; 
and had joined together &#8220;to drive death wounds into capitalism&#8221; . Hardly
had the Professor spoken his prophecy, than Hitler threw his armed
might against the Soviet Union and staked everything on crushing it.
Burnham&#8217;s &#8220;theory&#8221; proved no more enduring than the Stalin-Hitler Pact.</p>
<p>Two years later, Mussolini, the very pioneer of Burnham&#8217;s &#8220;New
society&#8221; , was deposed, more correctly dismissed, just as an employer
dismisses his plant superintendent, when his services are no longer
required. The precursor of the &#8220;new society&#8221; proved to be no more than
a common adventurer and cutthroat in the service of the Italian
bankers, monopolists and landlords. The Fascist regime simply fell
apart like a rotten apple.</p>
<p>Today, Hitler&#8217;s &#8220;new order&#8221; in Europe has already collapsed under
the double blows of his military opponents and the struggles of the
insurgent masses. And the downfall and total destruction of the Nazi
regime is not far off.</p>
<p>That is how events themselves have dealt with this bit of
pretentious humbug which for a few years &#8220;cut a big swathe&#8221; in
capitalist &#8220;cultural circles&#8221; and in the editorial offices of petty
bourgeois intellectualdom. And this &#8220;theory&#8221; , let it be remembered, was
the only half-serious attempt to counter-pose some sort of unified
logical conception to Trotsky&#8217;s Marxist analysis of Fascism as well as
his analysis of the Soviet Union and the Stalinist bureaucracy.</p>
<p>So much for Burnham&#8217;s theory and its inglorious fate. Little need be
said at this date of his shamefaced pupils and imitators of the
Shachtmanite variety with their pathetic attempts to discover a new
 &#8220;managerial class&#8221; but limited solely to the Soviet Union. In a new
form and in a different connection, this is a recreation of the
anti-Marxist idea of national exceptionalism, with a vengeance.</p>
<p>It is an elementary tenet of Marxism that a class is not an
accidental phenomenon, but emerges as an inevitable and necessary
vehicle of a given stage of production. Every ruling class has in its
own way represented a historically <em>necessary</em> and <em>unavoidable</em>

stage of social development and could be overthrown only when it had
exhausted its historical possibilities. Marxism knows of no
historically unnecessary classes and certainly knows of no classes that
are limited to &#8220;one country&#8221; . History has annihilated Burnham&#8217;s
 &#8220;theory&#8221; of the new bureaucratic class. It has disposed of his anemic
Shachtmanian imitators in passing.</p>
<p>Now I said that our question on the Soviet Union is an integral part
of our whole program of world revolution. It does not stand apart from
it. From our political characterization of the Soviet Union as a
degenerated workers state, we drew the conclusion that we must defend
the Soviet Union unconditionally against any and all imperialist
attacks. Now <em>that program</em> retains its validity. We don&#8217;t have
to change it. But we <em>always</em> defended the Soviet Union in our
own way, by our own methods, which had nothing in common with the
methods of Stalinism. Only those methods, we said, were permissible
that were not in conflict with the world revolution. Stalinist defense
was carried on under the slogans: For the Fatherland! For Stalin! Our
defense was carried on under the slogans: For Socialism! For the World
Revolution! Against Stalin!</p>
<p>While our basic position retains all of its validity, naturally, we
do not give <em>equal</em> emphasis to all sections of our program at
all times. We invariably push to the fore that section of our program,
that tactic, that slogan, which has the greatest application, which is
required by the general political situation. That is the art of
politics: to apply to the conditions of the day that part of your
policy which has the most immediate, the most burning urgency. When
Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, we began hollering at the top of our
voices for the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union. That was the
most important problem of world politics: save the Soviet Union from
imperialist attack. That was a key position in protecting and advancing
the revolution, which we knew would inevitably emerge out of the war.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A Different Situation</h4>

<p>Today, however, we face a far different situation. The Soviet Union
is no longer in immediate military danger. The Nazi attack has been
successfully repulsed. Hitler&#8217;s &#8220;New Order&#8221; has already been destroyed.
The Nazi regime faces imminent collapse. The continent is now in the
process of military occupation by the armies of England, the United
States and the Soviet Union. The European masses are in revolutionary
ferment. The European revolution is rising and the Anglo-American
imperialists have entered into a conspiracy with the Kremlin
bureaucracy to strangle the revolution and to prop up decaying
capitalism. That is the true picture of Europe today.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, it would be the height of unreal-ism, it
would betray a complete lack of revolutionary generalship to keep on
shouting the slogan of yesterday: Defend the Soviet Union. We do not
alter our program; we do not discard this slogan which at a later date
may possibly again acquire importance. But in the present situation
this slogan recedes to the background and we push to the fore that
section of our program which today has greatest importance; that
section compressed in the slogan: &#8220;Defend the European Revolution
against All Its Enemies,&#8221; against the imperialists, against the Kremlin
bureaucracy, against all its agents and agencies. As I said, we do not
change our program, but we very definitely are shifting our emphasis
today, in conformity with the needs of the situation, in conformity
with the changed relationship of forces, in conformity with the new
requirements.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we haven&#8217;t made this shift in our emphasis,
this tactical adjustment, just today. Some nine months ago our
committee discussed this very problem and came to the conclusion that
it was necessary to change the emphasis of our propaganda because of
the new conditions in Europe. The discerning reader will have noticed
that we conducted our propaganda in this spirit for a good many months.
We propose now to incorporate this tactical prescription in our
resolution, in order to make unambiguously clear to all, the nature of
our tactical adjustment and the reasons for it.</p>
<p>The Stalinist bureaucracy, which emerged about 20 years ago, lost
faith in the European revolution and proclaimed it realizable to build
socialism in the Soviet Union alone. Today the process of degeneration
has proceeded so far, this bureaucracy is so hated by the Soviet
masses, it is in such conflict with the nationalized economy and its
requirements, that it dreads, it mortally fears and opposes the
European revolution which is now rising. That is why Stalin has rushed
headlong into the arms of Roosevelt and Churchill, that is why he
conspired with them at Teheran to crush the revolution and to uphold
capitalism throughout Europe. That is why the Red Army, an instrument
of the counter-revolutionary bureaucracy, is used to prop up capitalism
in Rumania, Bulgaria, etc. Stalin is preparing to repeat his hangman&#8217;s
work in Spain on a Europe-wide scale.</p>
<p>Internally, we know that the bureaucracy has practically effaced all
the basic political conquests of the revolution; it has destroyed the
Bolshevik Party, the Soviets, the trade unions; it has murdered the
generation of leaders who led the Russian revolution; it has
reintroduced a savage despotism; it uses the Red Army as a gendarme of
capitalist property in Europe. Politically, the bureaucracy has
virtually gone the limit in its headlong drive toward reaction.
Economically, nationalized property and planned economy, these basic
conquests of the October revolution, still remain.</p>
<p>We know that the Kremlin bureaucracy does not represent a new class,
which has a historic function to perform, but is a parasitic caste,
thrown up because of a purely exceptional conjuncture of events, a
caste that is transitory in nature.</p>
<p>Now if we assume that the Kremlin bureaucracy allied with the
imperialists, succeeds in definitively crushing the European
revolution, then the fate of Europe is sealed. It can only become the
helpless vassal, a semi-colony of the Anglo-American brigands, a doomed
continent. <em>And sealed also is the fate of the Soviet Union</em>.
Because the path will be <em>immediately cleared</em> for the
reintroduction of capitalism in the Soviet Union, either by internal
counter-revolution or by external military intervention or by a
combination of both.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the workers&#8217; revolution emerges triumphant in
any country, we can assume that it will more or less rapidly penetrate
and make its influence felt among the Soviet masses and the Red Army
troops. Once the Soviet masses are lifted to their feet, the very first
thing they will proceed to do is overthrow the dictatorship of Stalin
and his bloody henchmen and restore the Soviet Union on the principles
and teachings of its founders&#8212;Lenin and Trotsky. <em>In either case
the Kremlin bureaucracy is doomed</em>. The Soviet Union is in a
transition period and that transition cannot too long endure. It is
either: forward to Socialism or backward to Capitalism. It cannot
indefinitely remain in its present form. <em>And it is clear that its
whole life is bound up with the fate of the European revolution</em>.
That is why we came back again to the same proposition: the fight to
protect, to defend, to extend, to deepen the European revolution is in
essence, and coincides with, the true defense of the Soviet Union
itself ...</p>
<p class="c">* * *</p>
<p class="fst">American imperialism, by its unbridled expansionism, by
its attempt to displace all rival imperialisms&#8212;not only Japan and
Germany, but also the defeated allies, such as France, and even its
partner-in-arms, British imperialism&#8212;is destroying every semblance of
stability in the Orient as well as in Europe, is exacerbating all the
inter-imperial conflicts and is becoming the irritant provoking new
revolutionary explosions. American imperialism, the greatest
counter-revolutionary force of the whole world, with its program of <em>Pax
Americana</em>, before which the ambitions of all previous imperialisms
pale, with its mad schemes of dominating all the continents and all the
seas, will become the very instrument of destroying the old equilibrium
and provoking new rebellions of the exploited masses ...</p>
<p>We are going to have to pay a lot of attention to our international
obligations in the period ahead. The revolution is rising and we must
be prepared to aid our co-fighters in every possible way. We have
already done quite a bit. But that is only a good beginning. The next
period will see the extension and growth of the Trotskyist movement,
especially in Europe, and our assistance will have to keep pace with
the opportunities and the needs of the struggle. We must stand ready to
give all possible help to our comrades who are on the firing line.</p>
<p>But the greatest aid that we can give our co-thinkers, the greatest
of all contributions that we can make is to perfect our movement,
strengthen our forces and redouble our fight against this predatory
beast of American Imperialism, this international marauder, who would
rob and subjugate the whole world.</p>
<p>We know the power of this Wall Street crew. We know that this gang
of Wall Street freebooters is prepared to wade through rivers of blood
to save its infamous rule. We know its armed prowess and its
counter-revolutionary designs. But we are also aware of its insoluble
contradictions. We know that our enemy will grow weaker and that, we
will grow stronger and will conquer in the end.</p>

<p>The power of a revolution is a <em>mighty</em> power. Before its
hot breath armies have been known to melt away and thrones come
crashing to the ground. The flames of the European revolution which,
once started, will surely spread throughout the continent like a
prairie fire, will make their effects felt even here across the
Atlantic. They will give a strong impetus to the process of
radicalization of the workers that is already beginning, and they will
inspire the coming class struggles here at home ...</p>
