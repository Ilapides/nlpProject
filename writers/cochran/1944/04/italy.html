<p class="fst">The developments in Italy are deserving of the closest
study. The unfolding Italian events provide an important preview of the
revolutionary temper and power of the European working class, the
status and role of the capitalist class and a virtual blueprint of
Anglo-American war aims, methods and plans.</p>
<p>This war is of course a continuation of the first World War, but as
the experience of Italy has already made amply clear, the developments
arising from this war are by no means mere replicas of the last one.
All the contradictions of European capitalism that reached supreme
acuteness after the last war twenty-five years ago, are now at a
breaking point. New contradictions have piled up in the interim.
Economic devastation has reached unheard of proportions. Political
decay has followed suit. Internally, no serious force remains to guard
capitalism in Europe except the scum of the upper class society&#8212;the
decrepit monarchs with their coterie of stark reactionary militarist
aristocracy, the Vatican, the cliques of the monopolists, the bankers
and their retinue. The reserves of capitalism in Europe are indeed
lower than they have ever been before. The field for capitalist class
maneuvers is far narrower than was the case a quarter of a century ago.</p>
<p>After the catastrophic defeats of the Italian army in Greece, North
Africa and Sicily, mass strikes swept over North Italy and the army
itself began disintegrating. The Allies were sure that Italy would soon
be knocked out of the war. They were prepared for a capitulation and
had plans in readiness for the occupation of Italy.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Secret Plans</h4>
<p class="fst">Kingsbury Smith, semi-official spokesman of the US State
Department, in an article written just before Mussolini&#8217;s downfall and
published in the <strong>American Mercury</strong> of August 1943, <em>Our
Government&#8217;s Plan for a Defeated Italy</em>, reveals in somewhat
guarded language the plans and perspectives of the US State Department:</p>

<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;We will help the Italian Army, Navy, or the people
to overthrow Mussolini&#8217;s regime, but we will nevertheless demand that
the country be handed over without any strings attached ... High
Italian army officers known to have the respect of the people will be
the group from which the United States and Great Britain will demand
the surrender of the nation ... Establishment of an allied military
government in Italy under American command is planned following
occupation of the country. <em>Some United States Army Civil Affairs
officers who are slated for occupational administrative work in Italy
already have arrived in North Africa</em>. Others are being trained as
Italian Administrators at the Army School of Military Government at
Charlottesville, Virginia ... Strict control will be exercised over the
Italian press and radio during the period of allied military rule ...&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">Gaetano Salvemini, a forthright analyst of Italian
policy, bluntly stated as early as December 1942, on the basis of a
study of Allied policies, that:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;The royal House of Savoy, the army and the Pope are
being kept on ice by Mr. Churchill and President Roosevelt as the
legitimate authorities entitled to speak for Italy ...&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">In their book, <strong>What To Do With Italy</strong>,
Gaetano Salvemini and George LaPiana, predicted before the fall of
Mussolini:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;As far as the American public can judge from what
has leaked out about the plans being secretly and discreetly concocted
in high circles, our diplomats in Washington are determined to supplant
Mussolini with an Italian Darlan or Petain ... If such a plan is
carried out, the Savoy monarchy will remain as a guarantee against any
radical revolution. A coalition of former leaders, the big business men
and clericals supported by the Vatican, would take up the government of
the country under the protection of the American and English armies of
occupation ... Every road leads to Rome, they say in Italy. And
everything we gather about British and American plans concerning Italy
leads us to the same conclusion. What the British foreign office and
the American State Department want to set up in Italy is a fascist
regime without Mussolini ...&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">The Anglo-American imperialists, it is obvious, did not
blunder into the Italian situation, did not improvise their policies,
nor leave the important political decisions to be made by military
field commanders on the spot. As Kingsbury Smith makes clear, and as
has been since corroborated by scores of correspondents and observers,
the Allies had a carefully worked out plan, a definite strategy and
policy and had prepared a trained personnel to execute their program.</p>
<p>But there is a gap between plans and reality. Events did not proceed
as smoothly as the State Department may have envisaged. The Allied
imperialist leaders expected a capitulation on the part of Italy. They
even anticipated local outbursts of the Italian people against the
Fascists. But they did not anticipate the great revolutionary
conflagration that actually swept Italy after the removal of Mussolini.
There was the specter of the Russian revolution and of the Italian
events of 1920 reappearing again! A feeling of anxiety and apprehension
swept through the government bureaus at Washington and London.
Churchill immediately warned Parliament that</p>

<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;We certainly do not wish to reduce Italian life to a
condition of chaos and anarchy, and find ourselves without any
authority with whom to deal.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">For Churchill, the Russian revolution, it must be
remembered, was the rule of &#8220;chaos and anarchy.&#8221; </p>
<p>A few hours after Churchill&#8217;s speech, Roosevelt, in a press
conference, demonstratively denounced the OWI broadcast which attacked
Badoglio and King Victor Emmanuel. Several days later, on July 30,
Roosevelt told newspapermen at his press conference that he &#8220;did not
care with whom we deal so long as he was not a member of the Fascist
government and could get the Italian troops to lay down their arms and
could prevent anarchy. It might be the King or a Prime Minister or a
Mayor who serve these ends.&#8221; </p>
<p>Mr. Kingsbury Smith, in his foregoing semi-official article, after
citing the Anglo-American propaganda of urging the Italian people to
revolt against Mussolini, patronizingly wrote:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;We are not opposed [how magnanimous!] to the Italian
people carrying out a blood purge of the fascists who have terrorized
and oppressed them for the past twenty years. But we believe they
should have the courage to do so <em>before</em> and not <em>after</em>
the Allied armies have occupied the country.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">The leaders of the two great &#8220;democracies&#8221; however
greeted the Italian revolution once it actually started with fear, with
a gnashing of teeth and with frenzied attempts to bolster the
makeshift, reactionary Badoglio government and to aid it in its
attempts to throttle the heroic struggle of the Italian workers who
were engaged in extirpating the Black Shirts, and fighting for freedom
and a workers&#8217; government of their own choosing. All through August,
the Anglo-American propaganda machine was inundating the world with
propaganda which all added up to a political build-up for the
government of Badoglio and the King. The Anglo-American forces were
already in control of Sicily, and their armies stood poised ready to
invade the mainland. The invasion was, however, delayed for weeks, in
deference to Badoglio and the King, in an attempt to give the new
military dictatorship an opportunity to put down the popular revolt. So
cynical and unabashed did Allied propaganda become that Amgot openly
announced that Italian officials would be permitted to remain at their
posts,&#8212;while the Italian people were warned that no political
activity would be tolerated. The Anglo-American program of reaction was
revealed with such a lack of ambiguity or disguise that even the
thoroughly housebroken liberals were embarrassed. They began
whimpering, in the general vein of I.F. Stone&#8217;s article in the August 7

<strong>Nation</strong>:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;I am beginning to feel that while we are ready to
make deals with any crooks at the top except full-fledged, fully
labeled Nazis and Fascists, we are out to demand &#8216;unconditional
surrender&#8217; of the peoples of Europe to what must begin to seem to them
Anglo-American imperialism. The Europe that Amgot would restore is not
a Europe in which the Four Freedoms could be achieved.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">But the Badoglio government was being torn apart by its
unsolvable crisis. Threats, repressions, martial law, promises of
reform, and concessions had availed nothing in the face of the rising
revolutionary tide. The Badoglio government was obviously impotent to
hold back the revolutionary advance. Its resources were dwindling by
the hour and its regime hung by a hair. The Italian army meanwhile was
fast melting away; discipline was breaking down, the authority of the
officers was on the wane and in the North, the Nazi armies were
preparing to advance and in the South the Allies stood in Sicily,
poised for the invasion of the mainland.</p>
<p>The Italian capitalists, behind Badoglio and the King, decided their
best chances for survival lay in throwing in their fate with the Allies.</p>
<p> &#8220;All legitimate hope&#8212;I do not say of victory, but even of
resistance&#8212;had vanished,&#8221; Badoglio truthfully stated in his
declaration to Hitler, announcing his government&#8217;s capitulation to the
Allies.</p>
<p>At this point occurred one of the most brazen betrayals of a people:
between Badoglio and the Anglo-American imperialists a conspiracy was
hatched to betray the Italian proletariat in the North to the Nazi
beasts, to drown the revolution in blood while foisting in the
allied-occupied territory in Southern Italy the Quisling government of
Victor Emmanuel and Badoglio.</p>
<p>Secret conferences between the Allied imperialists and Badoglio were
in progress all through the latter end of August and beginning of
September. While the terms of the armistice and Italy&#8217;s &#8220;unconditional
surrender&#8221; were being drafted, the Italian workers of the industrial
north were clamoring for arms to defend themselves against the Nazi
hordes. But neither Badoglio nor the Anglo-American &#8220;democrats&#8221; were
interested in defending Northern Italy against the Nazis. They were not
interested in organizing the workers and the revolutionary soldiers to
fight the Nazis: they had already reconciled their plans to the Nazis&#8217;
marching in and subduing the revolutionary proletariat.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Secret Conferences</h4>

<p class="fst">On September 3, the armistice between the Badoglio
government and the Allies was signed. It was made public only a week
later on September 11. Discerning commentators had no difficulty in
establishing the fact that another, more cynical &#8220;Darlan deal&#8221; had been
contrived, that the Allies were preparing to prop up a reactionary
clique of monarchists and capitalist politicians whose hands dripped
with the 20-year crimes of the Fascist regime.</p>
<p>The September 4 dispatch of Herbert L. Matthews, <strong>New York
Times</strong> correspondent, stated that:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;The AMG experience in Sicily would seem to
strengthen Marshal Badoglio&#8217;s chances of continuing in power after the
Allies enter Rome. He could prove highly useful and that was the
criterion in the case of Admiral Jean Francais Darlan.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst"><strong>Libera Stampa</strong>, Italian anti-fascist
newspaper, published in Lausanne, Switzerland, revealed the whole
treacherous conspiracy in its October 1 report. According to <strong>Libera
Stampa</strong> as soon as Turin learned the news of the Armistice:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;The workers through their leaders suspended work in
the big factories ... to assume ... the armed defense of their city
(against the Nazi troops). But they needed arms. Representatives of the
Turin workers therefore called in the Commander of the Turin garrison,
General Adamirossi, (one of Badoglio&#8217;s appointees) and asked for arms
to repel an eventual attack on the part of German armored troops which
they knew were advancing on Turin.</p>

<p class="quote"> &#8220;The workers&#8217; representatives assumed full
responsibility for the distribution of arms to their organized
supporters, promising not to give them to suspicious elements.</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;General Adamirossi courteously asked them to be
patient during the few hours necessary for transportation and delivery
of the arms.</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;However, a tragic betrayal was being prepared: the
workers&#8217; leaders were handed over to the Germans who had arrived in the
meantime. The time which General Adamirossi had demanded for the
delivery of the arms was used by him to conclude an agreement with the
Germans for the surrender to them of Turin.</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;General Adamirossi apparently has already paid with
his life, at the hand of a worker, for this treachery.&#8221; So it was
throughout the northern cities. Like the workers of Turin, the workers
of Bergamo demanded arms. The Associated Press reported on September 12
that the military commander stalled them off with the pretext &#8220;that
only a few outmoded rifles were available.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">In Milan, the betrayal took a different form. The
workers and soldiers, by their own actions, succeeded in wiping out the
Nazi forces stationed in the city. General Reggiero, Badoglio&#8217;s
commanding officer, frightened to death by this success, hastened to
proclaim the city as surrendered to the Nazis at a time when the Nazi
army had not even reached the outskirts of the city. He reached an
agreement with the Nazi commanders and proceeded to maintain &#8220;order&#8221; in
the Milan area for the Nazis! The workers continued their resistance;
two days later the Nazis took over the counter-revolutionary work
themselves.</p>
<p>The Anglo-American imperialists did not limit themselves to mere
moral encouragement of Badoglio and his generals in this butcher&#8217;s
work. They made no attempt to impede Nazi forces from pouring into
Italy. As a matter of fact, they facilitated their entrance through the
use of the Allied air force. Gaetano Salvemini voiced his indignation
at their brutal counter-revolutionary work in a special interview
published in <strong>PM</strong> on October 10, 1943:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;America sent bombers to bomb the people of Milan,
Genoa, Turin in August to smash the revolution. There were
demonstrations in the streets, but instead of bombing the Brenner Pass,
through which the German army was pouring in, America bombed the
Italians. Badoglio&#8217;s soldiers wouldn&#8217;t shoot Italian demonstrators: So
we sent bombers&#8212;American liberators.&#8221; </p>

<p class="fst">This saturation bombing of the revolutionary centers was
so scandalous, it showed so unmistakably that the political war of the
Allies, the war to destroy the European revolution took precedence over
the imperialist war with Germany, that even some of the British
laborites like Anuerin Bevan protested in the British Parliament,
bluntly accusing the Churchill government of being
counter-revolutionary.</p>
<p>Thus, in the very midst of the imperialist slaughter, the
imperialist leaders reached out across the battle lines, to establish
collaboration, and each in his own way and in the manner available,
rained blows on the first large-scale attempt of the European workers
in the second World War to throw off the yoke of despotism, to break
out of the bloody ring, and to take their destinies into their own
hands.</p>
<p>It was only towards the middle of September, only after the Nazis
had occupied most of Italy, only after the Black Shirts dared show
their faces in the streets again, only after the workers were hurled
back to the defensive, that the Allies breathed freely again. The
crisis, they thought, was over. The revolution had been crushed, they
thought, with the timely and blessed assistance of the Nazis, through
their conspiracy with Badoglio.</p>
<p>Today, thousands of American and British soldiers are dying in
savage battles in Italy. For what? In an attempt to win back the
territories that Churchill and Roosevelt helped Badoglio hand over to
the Nazis last September.</p>
<p>Only after the Anglo-American imperialists were convinced that the
situation was beginning to stabilize along &#8220;normal&#8221; lines and felt that
they could manipulate the political situation in their own imperialist
interests, did they proceed to launch the military campaign against the
Nazis.</p>
<p>The military strategy was obviously aligned in every detail with
their political aims and purposes. The Allies moved at a measured,
leisurely, and phlegmatic pace, solidifying each new position before
proceeding further not only from a military point of view, but what was
even more important from the political point of view. Even though Italy
is a secondary military battlefield of the second World War, and the
number of troops engaged is relatively small, the whole Italian
campaign provides a clear and instructive example of how military
strategy is subordinated and, as a matter of fact, determined by the
basic political aims of the ruling class waging the war. Just as
Salvemini had predicted, the Anglo-American imperialists now proceeded
to put into effect, step by step, their whole counter-revolutionary
program of converting Italy into a semi-colony and imposing on its
people a military dictatorship based on the monarchy, the Vatican and
the capitalist and landlord cliques.</p>
<p>Every upper class organization in Italy, the brass hats, the
Vatican, the church hierarchy, the monarchy, the big capitalists and
landlords had all thoroughly discredited themselves with the <em>whole</em>
of the Italian people, through 20 years association, support and
participation in the Fascist regime. Their hands were soaked with the
people&#8217;s blood. The only forces which could possibly enjoy a certain
credit, a certain support among masses of the population were the
Allies themselves. Unquestionably, in the first days, considerable
sections of the Italian people were fooled by Roosevelt&#8217;s and
Churchill&#8217;s professed aims of &#8220;liberation&#8221; and &#8220;democracy&#8221; and really
welcomed the Allied armies.</p>

<p>The Allies manipulated these illusions of the Italian people to wage
against them, as soon as they had cleared a given territory of the Nazi
forces, a virtual war, now masked, now open, to violate their wishes,
and to impose upon them a government of the self-same elements that
made up the warp and woof of the Mussolini regime.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4> &#8220;Democracies&#8221; and Sicily</h4>
<p class="fst">The Allies had already acquired a certain experience in
this dastardly work. In Sicily, the Amgot first went into action under
the chairmanship of Lord Rennell of Rodd, British millionaire banker,
partner of Morgan Grenfell, London affiliate of J.P. Morgan and Co.,
and bosom friend of Volpi, one of Mussolini&#8217;s financial backers.</p>
<p>Rennell and his gang of dyed-in-the-wool reactionaries proceeded to
install what Salvemini has designated as &#8220;fascism minus Mussolini.&#8221; On
July 18, a week before the fall of Mussolini, General Alexander, then
Allied Military Governor of Sicily issued a proclamation ordering the
dissolution of the Fascist party. The decree outlined the new
government in the following manner:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;All administrative and judicial officials of
provinces and communities and all other government municipal
functionaries and employees, and all officers and employees of the
state, municipal or other public services except such officials and
political leaders as are removed by me are required to continue in
performance of their duties subject to my direction.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">This of course meant that the Black Shirt set-up was
preserved virtually intact.</p>
<p>Herbert L. Matthews, <strong>New York Times</strong> correspondent,
described how this policy operated in practice. In the reorganized
government apparatus of Palermo, Sicily&#8217;s largest city, every official
included was a fascist and appointed by the fascists. Matthews explains:</p>

<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;There must be a great degree of leniency, because
every post, however insignificant, had been filled under Premier
Mussolini, by a fascist. To eliminate all the fascists would completely
paralyze every function of the government. The real anti-fascists here
do not like that so much. Apparently they had expected the whole
fascist set-up to be swept away, but that is impossible and will be so
throughout Italy ... Naturally the primary consideration was the swift
restoration of law and order. That could toe accomplished; only with
the help of the Italian police.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">Amgot also announced that they were ready to bring the
blessings of democracy to the Sicilians and that &#8220;within the limits of
military necessity a free press and free speech is to be allowed, but
that no political activity of any kind will be allowed.&#8221; Salvemini
correctly demanded to know: &#8220;How can free speech and a free press exist
if no political activity of any kind is allowed?&#8221; </p>
<p>Matthews summed up the Amgot method several weeks later in an
article in the August 22 <strong>New York Times Magazine</strong>.
There was first fear among the Fascists, Matthews explains, &#8220;that the
Allies would prosecute them because they were Fascists.&#8221; He then adds:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;In Sicily we have demonstrated that we have no such
intention, for the obvious reason that something like 90 percent of the
administration in every walk of life is Fascist and to eliminate all
Fascists would mean complete paralysis and chaos ...&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">Matthews sums up: &#8220;Fascism is being destroyed&#8212;at least
on paper.&#8221; </p>
<p>All the old, moth-eaten, cynical imperialist formulas were dragged
out once again to alibi this act of betrayal&#8212;&#8220;Military necessity,&#8221; 
humanitarian considerations ( &#8220;saving human lives&#8221; ), &#8220;no politics until
the Nazis are driven out,&#8221; etc., etc.,&#8212;all the hollow phrases that
had been employed before in North Africa in the case of the Darlan
Deal. But here even the pretext that allegedly existed in North Africa
was lacking, inasmuch as all military activities had ceased. Upon the
signing of the Armistice, the Allies had complete undisputed control of
the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Once the full meaning of Amgot policy was understood, its effect on
the Sicilian population can easily be imagined. The disillusionment
must have been especially sweeping, after the revolutionary upsurge in
the mainland and the open Allied support of Badoglio and the King. An
article signed &#8220;A Combatant&#8221; printed in the British <strong>Observer</strong>

at the end of October 1943 depicted the disillusionment and despair
engendered by the cold blooded Amgot policy even among the Allied
soldiers themselves. This article stated:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;The writer has personal knowledge of a case in which
two members of the OVRA&#8212;the Fascist secret police&#8212;were arrested,
sent off to the local Amgot headquarters, and returned twenty-four
hours later as qualified Amgot officials to the same town which they
had bossed for the Fascists.</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;Military expediency may provide a sound reason for
decisions taken in certain cases, but there is an unmistakable worried
feeling among the troops that something has gone wrong&#8212;even that they
have been misled.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">Toward the end of October, four months after the
military occupation of Sicily and one month after the signing of the
Armistice, the Allied Military Government first issued its decree
restoring the <em>Camera del Lavoro</em>, the trade union Center in
Palermo.</p>
<p>This decree was at first hailed by several British and American
trade union bureaucrats as a restoration of the pre-fascist trade
unions. Once the actual decree was published, it was obvious that the
Allies were attempting to perpetuate Mussolini&#8217;s system of government &#8212;
sponsored company unions. The decree provided for:</p>
<ol>
<li>The director and staff of the Center are to be appointed under
AMG supervision instead of elected by the union members.</li>
<li>Present wage contracts&#8212;negotiated by Fascist officials and
employers&#8212;remain in force.</li>

<li>All public meetings remain banned by AMG.</li>
<li>If any disagreements arise on wages or working conditions, they
are subject to compulsory arbitration. Strikes and lockouts are
strictly forbidden and will be punished.</li>
</ol>
<p class="fst">This new trade union restoration was on a par with the
previous &#8220;restoration&#8221; of freedom of press and speech. It fully tallied
with Mark Twain&#8217;s aphorism that freedom of speech is something you&#8217;ve
got provided you don&#8217;t use it. Even the <strong>Sicilia Liberata</strong>,
the only newspaper permitted to appear in Sicily (Mussolini, too,
permitted that kind of freedom of press) came out with sharp criticisms
of the new decree.</p>
<p>In an editorial entitled <em>Cards on the Table</em> the newspaper
stated:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;All positions of responsibility must be held by
proven antifascists. This is the appeal we made to the Allied
authorities. This is no time to take a middle course. To entrust
positions of authority to those who tomorrow would become our
executioners would be a grave and unforgivable error. The time has come
to assume the responsibilities for our own future.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">It is easy to imagine the reaction of the Sicilians to
Allied occupation and Amgot policy when the <em>only</em> paper
permitted to appear speaks in terms of bitter complaint.</p>

<p>The vile hypocrisy with which the Allies carry through their
dictatorial reactionary policies is well illustrated by an incident
reported in the pro-Allied, pro-Roosevelt, pro-war, <strong>Daily
Worker</strong> of January 13, 1944. Charles Poletti, then military
Governor of Palermo, opened the new City Hall in the latter part of
November and hailed in his address the &#8220;rebirth of Italian democracy.&#8221; 
He elaborated on the &#8220;new era of dignity&#8212;the dignity of free men &#8212;
begins for the people of Palermo.&#8221; But it turned out that the new mayor
and city council had all been hand-picked by Poletti himself; they were
all either dukes, lawyers and men of wealth who had for 20 years
supported Mussolini. &#8220;Not a single anti-fascist was among them,&#8221; says
the <strong>Daily Worker</strong>.</p>
<p>Such is the democracy which the Allied military occupation
authorities have devised in Sicily. Freedom of press&#8212;with only one
newspaper permitted to appear; freedom of speech&#8212;with all public
meetings banned; freedom of trade unions&#8212;with all union officials
appointed by Amgot, and with the old contracts imposed during
Mussolini&#8217;s regime remaining in full force, with all grievances subject
to compulsory arbitration, with all strikes banned and severely
punished; the &#8220;rebirth of Italian democracy&#8221; &#8212;with all public
officials appointed by Amgot, from among the wealthy landlords and
capitalists, the bulwark of Mussolini&#8217;s Fascist regime.</p>
<p>This was the type of regime that the Allies aimed to impose on the
whole of Italy. But a regime of this type proved far more difficult to
force on all Italy than on small, predominantly agricultural and
backward Sicily. And what is more, much to Allied chagrin, a
revolution, not called for in their schedule, erupted on the mainland;
it was checked only with the greatest difficulty and only by turning
over the bulk of Italy to the Nazi butchers. The Allies could not
proceed on the mainland in the same crude manner as in Sicily, lest
they provoke armed clashes between their military forces and the native
population of every village, hamlet and city. They had watched Hitler&#8217;s
occupation methods and learned how difficult it is to subdue a hostile
population, by naked military force alone. Far more expedient is to
rule through a subservient native government, which bears the onus of
imposing &#8220;law and order&#8221; on the sullen and rebellious populace.</p>
<p>Churchill himself had made this thoroughly clear in his eloquent
speech to Parliament when the Italian masses first took to the streets.
On July 27, Churchill said:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;Now that Mussolini has gone and the Fascist power
has certainly been irretrievably broken, we would be foolish to deprive
ourselves of any means of coming to a general conclusion with tie
Italian nation ... Past experience shows that in cases of great change
of heart and character in government of a nation very often one stage
is rapidly succeeded by another ... It would be a grave mistake when
Italian affairs are in this flexible, fluid and formative condition for
the rescuing power of Britain and the United States so to act as to
break down the whole structure and expression of the Italian state. We
certainly do not wish to reduce Italian life to a condition of chaos
and anarchy, and find ourselves without any authority with whom to deal
...&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">Churchill and Roosevelt after the signing of the
Armistice on September 3 were fully embarked on their campaign against
 &#8220;chaos and anarchy&#8221; and for the restoration of &#8220;law and order.&#8221; They
began to impose their counter-revolutionary regime step by step on the
Italian people by strengthening and buttressing the authority of
Badoglio and the decrepit monarchy, by strengthening the authority of
the Vatican and the church hierarchy, by attempting to provide the
discredited upper class scum, with a reconstituted military force.</p>

<p>On September 21, ten days after the Armistice had been made public,
Churchill came out flat-footedly for the government of Badoglio and
King Victor Emmanuel. In his report to the House of Commons, Churchill
stated:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;It is necessary ... that all the surviving forces in
Italy&#8217;s national life should be rallied together around their
government and that the King and Marshal Badoglio should be supported
by liberal and left-wing elements ...&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">Roosevelt sent Adolph A. Berle, Assistant Secretary of
State to the Columbus Day meeting of the Italian-American Committee in
Boston, with a personal message calling upon labor to throw its support
behind the Badoglio government. Badoglio and Victor Emmanuel were
afforded the facilities of the Allied radio to broadcast their
propaganda to the Italian people, while everybody else was gagged and
anyone attempting to speak thrown into jail.</p>
<p>On September 22, Badoglio, feeling more confident, with the
Anglo-American bayonets propping his government, told the Italian
people over the Allied radio that &#8220;The King, the royal family are the
expression of the will of the Italian people.&#8221; On October 2 the King
ordered the people to obey Badoglio as &#8220;the interpreter of my will.&#8221; 
The King apparently had plans of staying on for a while to come:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;Yesterday, as always, your King is with you,
indissolubly linked with the destiny of the immortal fatherland.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">On October 1 the Allied armies entered Naples. There was
no military encounter with the Nazis. The Italian anti-Fascists had
just finished a savage four-day battle with the Nazi invaders; the
Nazis facing an Allied attack in the midst of this hostile and
aggressive population, decided the better part of valor was to retire.
Hal Boyle, the Associated Press correspondent received the following
description of the events from Umberto Franco, a local glass
manufacturer:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;Street fighting broke out after the Germans ordered
the citizens to give up their guns and told 30,000 Italian men to
report for labor conscription on September 24.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">Mme. Maleville, Secretary to the Naples Hospital,
reported that:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;The civil war started last Saturday while the
Germans were burning and looting the city of everything they could
take. The people took up guns, knives and anything they could and
fought the Germans and the Fascists who still supported them. There
have been hundreds and hundreds of persons wounded.&#8221; </p>

<p class="fst">Hal Boyle who entered Naples with the Allied troops
described the anti-fascists as &#8220;young Italian guerrillas, fighting with
collars open and no helmets, looked like something out of the French
Revolution.&#8221; Boyle states that &#8220;the whole (Naples) Battle was fought
without a single American casualty.&#8221; Herbert L. Matthews in his cable
to the <strong>New York Times</strong> on the Naples battle spoke of
the conduct of the Italian anti-fascists in rapturous terms: &#8220;an
episode of genuine heroism.&#8221; </p>
<p>In a later dispatch Matthews reported:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;When Badoglio&#8217;s government announced its armistice
on September 8, the people rose joyously. All that night and all the
following day they had the Germans on the run. The Germans were
surrendering their arms to Italians ... Had Naples been properly
organized ... it would have made all the difference. However, there was
no anti-fascist organization ... So the Germans quickly regained
control, but they did it with the help of fascist hierarchs and above
all many fascist Black Shirts. Those Black Shirts became marked men ...
When those days of reckoning came, everyone of those Black Shirts ...
met death at the hands of the citizens. They were willing to take the
Germans alive ... because after all they were doing only what they had
been ordered to do. But when the Italians caught a Black Shirt, he
died.&#8221; <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Events in Naples</h4>
<p class="fst">The Naples proletariat showed again that the Italian
revolution had not been crushed; it had been merely delayed. The Naples
proletariat revealed those traits that the workers have displayed again
and again in every real people&#8217;s revolution: their genius for
organization and their contempt for death. Unfortunately, they had not
had the time to organize themselves politically and build a leadership
that expressed their revolutionary aspirations and aims.</p>
<p>Matthews correctly states that the Neapolitan masses could have been
organized to drive out the Nazis when the armistice was announced. The
Allies were interested in just the opposite. They were determined that
the Italian proletariat remain disorganized and unarmed, and if
necessary they were willing to turn them over temporarily to the tender
mercies of the Nazi wolves.</p>
<p>What the Nazis were unable to accomplish, the Allies quickly
achieved: they disarmed the Neapolitan masses (after all, were they not
 &#8220;liberators&#8221; ?) and proceeded to restore &#8220;law and order.&#8221; They now
proceeded to carry through their perfidious program with the greatest
possible energy. Naples had been occupied militarily. It was now
indispensable to conquer it <em>politically</em> and convert it into a
solid bastion of reaction.</p>

<p>On October 13, one month after Italy&#8217;s &#8220;unconditional surrender&#8221; and
the imposition of armistice terms, reported by the correspondents as
harsher than those Hitler imposed on France, the Allies suddenly
announced that Italy was recognized as a &#8220;co-belligerent&#8221; and would be
a partner of the Allies, albeit a minor one. This time, Roosevelt and
Churchill had succeeded in having their counter-revolutionary schemes
underwritten by Stalin. The Mediterranean Commission, composed of
representatives of the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union, was
set up. From now on, the counter-revolutionary program in Italy was to
have the full endorsement of the Kremlin bureaucracy. Stalin fittingly
appointed Alexander Vyshinski, prosecutor in the infamous Moscow
frame-up trials, as his representative.</p>
<p>All correspondents freely admitted that the new Allied stratagem was
devoid of military significance. Its purpose was exclusively political
&#8212; to bolster the shadow Badoglio government and to provide it with an
ostensible military purpose for creating a new army.</p>
<p>Badoglio took the occasion to inform the Italian people that he was
going to stay on indefinitely as their minister:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;The present government has clearly defined the task
of leading the country until peace has been won. With that its mandate
will cease.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">From the day of the recognition of the Badoglio regime
as a co-belligerent in the Allied camp, dates a whole series of
incidents, suppressions, arrests, etc., in the systematic war of the
Allies and their Badoglio shadow government against the Italian people.</p>
<p>On October 21, Herbert L. Matthews suddenly revealed that three
prominent liberals of Apulia were jailed for printing and disseminating
an &#8220;unauthorized newspaper.&#8221; Matthews apologetically explains that he
is recording the incident &#8220;because it has created such a sensation and
such unhappy bewilderment in liberal circles here.&#8221; We learn that in
Southern Italy, as in Sicily, only <em>one</em> newspaper is
permitted, in this case the <strong>Gazetta del Mezzogiorno</strong>.
 &#8220;A group of important liberals who had suffered imprisonment under
Fascism say that they tried to get their ideas published in the <strong>Gazetta</strong>

but failed.&#8221; Matthews further revealed that on the same day, &#8220;A
communist named Senisi also was arrested for disseminating a sheet
called <strong>Civilta Communista</strong>.&#8221; </p>
<p>In his next day&#8217;s dispatch Matthews reported that Count Sforza who
had just arrived from the United States was &#8220;saddened&#8221; by the &#8220;vestiges
of Fascism that cling to official life in Allied-occupied Italy and the
machinations of the court circle.&#8221; </p>
<p>For an old monarchist politician to oppose the Badoglio regime so
demonstratively upon his arrival in Italy, to so sharply change his
tone from the statement he issued on leaving the United States when he
told newspapermen that it would be &#8220;almost an act of treason&#8221; to oppose
the Badoglio government and that loyal support should be given Badoglio
as long as he enjoys the confidence of the Anglo-American leaders &#8212;
this change of front shows eloquently enough what the political temper
of Naples must be.</p>
<p>But in spite of the mounting dissatisfaction and indignation of the
masses, the Badoglio regime for the first time began to breathe freely.
The Italian capitalists were finally resting on Anglo-American
bayonets. On November 3, King Victor Emmanuel, for the first time since
the downfall of Mussolini, dared show himself in public. The King rode
through the streets of Naples in what was intended to be a monarchist
demonstration. Matthews explained:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;At present, as long as the Allied Military Mission
sits at the King&#8217;s side, he is immune ... Since the Allies are
preventing political agitation, whatever Marshal Badoglio and the King
decide will stand up.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">A week later, Badoglio demonstratively announced that
the new political government to be set up in Rome would be &#8220;formed by
the King.&#8221; </p>
<p>On November 9, it was reported that the units of anti-Fascist
volunteers, which had been set up in Naples, since the October days,
had been ordered disbanded, and that the men would be drafted into the
regular Italian army under General Basso, &#8220;one of the King&#8217;s generals.&#8221; 
Basso is a reactionary monarchist officer who served as director
general of Artillery under Mussolini.</p>
<p>It was further decreed that &#8220;the cross of Savoy over the left breast
pocket&#8221; was to be placed on every soldier&#8217;s uniform and that &#8220;all
vehicles are also marked with the cross of King Victor Emmanuel&#8217;s
house.&#8221; </p>

<p>On November 22, Sir Harold R.L.G. Alexander, announced that he had
named General Basso as head of the new Italian Military Command &#8220;over
all Italian armed forces in Campania.&#8221; The appointment comes from &#8220;the
Royal Italian government with my approval,&#8221; General Alexander&#8217;s order
stated.</p>
<p>The drive to reimpose on the Italian people a naked military
dictatorship became so sustained, all-sided, energetic and brazen that
by November 22, only a month after he arrived in Italy, Sforza was
already loudly accusing the Badoglio government of striving to build a
 &#8220;royalist-clerical-neo-Fascist movement.&#8221; <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The &#8220;Blue Party&#8221; </h4>
<p class="fst">While anti-fascists were being clapped into jail, while
all anti-fascist activity was prohibited, the upper class scum
highlighted their activity by attempts to organize again &#8220;punitive
expeditions&#8221; as during Mussolini&#8217;s regime and by a new ambitious
venture to reconstitute themselves as a political force. On November
26, the Associated Press carried the following information:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;The Monarchist &#8216;Blue Party&#8217;, newest group to enter
Italy&#8217;s political arena, opened a high-pressure campaign today to rally
support to the shaky cause of the Royal House of Savoy ... Placards
calling on the people to rally to the monarch ... were posted on
buildings in the city. Pamphlets reminding the people of the services
of the House of Savoy to Italy were disseminated throughout towns and
villages in that part of the country liberated from the Germans ... The
leaders are not prominent Italians, but a number of aristocrats and
highly placed army and navy officers are reported to be members ...&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">The November 26 dispatch to the <strong>New York Times</strong>
stated that Professor Omadeo, rector of Naples University, related:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;That much of the poster-erecting is being done by
Carabinieri, sometimes in civilian clothes, at the orders of the
military ... Other reliable quarters have given further evidence of
what used to be called Squadrism&#8212;which is now being practiced by
elements that must be considered the equivalent of Fascists&#8212;such as
threats to burn houses, or to beat, and in one notable case, to kill
known anti-fascists.&#8221; </p>

<p class="fst">The Monarchist &#8220;Blue Party&#8221; has its genesis in the
Nationalist Party which was organized in Florence in 1910, with a
program in American terms similar to a combination of the programs of
the Navy League, the NAM and the American Legion. By 1921, the
Nationalist Movement was accepted by Mussolini as a &#8220;parallel movement&#8221; 
in a common struggle. After the march on Rome, the Fascists having
adopted all the tenets of Nationalism, the two parties merged.</p>
<p>Salvemini described the Nationalist Party as monarchist, militarist,
aristocratic, anti-parliamentarian, protectionist, and favoring an
alliance between the church and state:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;It was the party of toe general staff of the army
and navy and big business ... Now that the Fascist Party has been
discredited by all kinds of disasters, the old Nationalist Party
renamed the Blue Party, has been revived under the wings of the AMG.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">This all-out campaign of reaction reached a climax when
a unit of Italian soldiers was thrown into an attack on the Nazi lines.
The <strong>New York Herald Tribune</strong> correspondent described
the action as &#8220;little short of suicide ... The first wave of attackers
was virtually destroyed. The second, shoved in frantically from the
reserve suffered grave casualties ... It might as well be admitted that
no one was very much surprised.&#8221; </p>
<p>But the battle had a political, not a military purpose. It was
widely advertised that the Crown Prince had flown over the enemy lines,
 &#8220;a trip which takes courage and demonstrates a general desire to
rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the people.&#8221; Salvemini correctly
appraised the significance of this military action of December 8:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;Mussolini attacked France in June 1940 because he
needed a few thousand dead in order to get a seat at the impending
peace conference. In December 1943, Badoglio needed a few hundred
Italian dead to enhance the prestige of the royal house.&#8221; <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Wooing the Vatican</h4>

<p class="fst">Parallel with the attempt to recreate the old Monarchist
party, to build up a military force at the disposal of the Big Business
clique around Badoglio and the House of Savoy, and to suppress every
manifestation of democracy, democratic rights and the independent
organization and activity of the masses, went the attempt to build up
the power of the Vatican and to increase its hold over the Italian
people.</p>
<p>Shortly after the conquest of Sicily, General Alexander, the then
military governor of Sicily, held a conference with Cardinal Laritiano,
Archbishop of Palermo, and proposed that the public schools be reopened
and proceed with their educational work &#8220;under the direction of the
ecclesiastical authorities.&#8221; The reactionary depth of this proposal can
be appreciated when we recall that the Italian public schools, even
during Mussolini&#8217;s regime, have never been surrendered to the
supervision of the clergy. The AMG thus tried to put over the program
long cherished and advocated by the Vatican, of destroying the
separation of church and state and putting all education under the
control of the Catholic church&#8212;the powerhouse of reaction and
obscurantism.</p>
<p>The <strong>New York Herald Tribune</strong> carried information on
October 8 from Naples that:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;All schools remained closed, but the AMG will permit
Catholic schools to reopen soon. The religious schools have received
priority because the AMG feels that Catholic textbooks and teachers are
less imbued with fascist doctrines.&#8221; </p>
<p>What lying scoundrels! Salvemini has demonstrated long ago that
 &#8220;books sent to this country for use in Italian-language parochial
schools are stuffed with Fascist propaganda, and the Church has never
objected.&#8221; As a matter of fact, why should the Catholic church object?
The Pope considers the ruthless dictatorship of Salazar in Portugal as
the &#8220;model Christian state,&#8221; the regime of the butcher Franco as
ordained by God. The October 11 <strong>New York Times</strong>
carried the following information :</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;Mass was celebrated today at the Cathedral of San
Gennaro in the presence of Alessio Cardinal Ascalesi, with Lieut.
General Mark W. Clark and other high American officers in attendance.&#8221; </p>

<p>Salvemini correctly pointed out:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;... Attending mass officially with one&#8217;s retinue to
the presence of a cardinal is not a religious observance. It is a
political act. Cardinal Ascalesi is a man who has been discredited
throughout Italy by his unbridled greed for money and his consistent
servility to Fascism ... To Italians such a gesture could only imply
that General Clark had been instructed to encourage some brand of
clerical Fascism in Italy.&#8221; </p>
<p>The AMG is trying to restore the political power of the Vatican, not
as it existed even under the Mussolini regime, but as it existed a
century ago, before the Italian Risorgimento. United States
imperialism, brash and arrogant, even ventures at times to flaunt its
imperial aims and boast of its imperial power. We must go back to the
writings in Britain of Disraeli&#8217;s day to find a suitable counterpart.
Demaree Bess, on numerous occasions a semi-official spokesman of the
State Department, afforded special privileges and confidential data by
the State Department officials in North Africa and elsewhere, wrote an
article printed in the October 30 issue of the <strong>Saturday
Evening Post</strong>, under the self-confident title: <em>Power
Politics Succeeded in Italy</em>. He discards all pretense, all
diplomatic double talk, he casts aside all the apologetics and alibis
and not only reveals but defends American imperialism and its quest for
power. He writes:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;Most Americans have an ingrained distrust of power
politics&#8212;those maneuvers through which clever statesmen get what they
want from foreign countries by reinforcing their political negotiations
with military pressure. And yet the American people have three times
elected as our President a man who takes the keenest interest in power
politics, and who is one of its most resourceful and successful
practitioners.</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;... The two allied statesmen were indeed negotiating
with conservative Italians who had collaborated with Fascism and with
Germany; they were trying to make &#8216;another Darlan deal&#8217; in Italy. Where
the critics made themselves appear ludicrous was in asserting that
power politics wouldn&#8217;t work ... It is a cold-blood game, having
nothing whatever to do with ideologies or crusades. It is the kind of
game which Hitler and Stalin played when they struck a bargain with
each other in 1939.</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;... The men whom the Allied governments selected to
abolish Fascism in Sicily were not the type to be rash in interpreting
this directive. Most of them are conservative or moderate in their
political views and this is particularly true of the higher ranks. Our
soldiers thus invaded Italian territory with the effective slogan:
&#8216;Abolish Fascism!&#8217; but with such a conservative policy otherwise that
it amounted to the freezing of the status quo in Sicily, once
Mussolini&#8217;s personal party machine had been destroyed. The decks were
thus cleared for negotiations with any group inside Italy which could
get rid of Mussolini ... those hostile critics who complained that
Allied statesmen were making another Darlan deal were, therefore, not
unjustified in their contention, because our deal with Marshal Badoglio
was indeed the same kind of deal ... This time, however, allied
statesmen arranged to obtain in advance Marshal Stalin&#8217;s approval of
their agreement with Italian military leaders ...&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">With what results have the Anglo-American imperialists
labored in the vineyard? What successes have they achieved in their
program of counter-revolution, political suppression, the recreation of
a military dictatorship and clerical and monarchical restoration? The
results are very tenuous; their hold very uneasy. The waging of war
upon the Italian population has produced a political crisis of the
greatest tension and explosive power. Every political observer,
regardless of his political beliefs, has asserted that once the Allied
military are withdrawn, the Badoglio government will be blown skyhigh.
It does not enjoy the slightest semblance of popular support. It faces
instead the hostility of <em>all</em> classes of Italian society,
except for the thin layer of the very wealthy. This is proved by every
public manifestation, where the masses have had an opportunity to voice
their feelings and demands and by the fact that prior to the Kremlin&#8217;s
latest betrayal not <em>one</em> political figure, including a
conservative monarchist like Senator Croce, could be found to associate
himself or join with the Badoglio government and the House of Savoy.</p>

<p> &#8220;To find an exponent of the Royalist viewpoint,&#8221; wrote the <strong>New
York Times</strong> correspondent, &#8220;it was necessary to go to the
military ranks, for there is no civilian among the politically active
elements who is not against Victor Emmanuel.&#8221; </p>
<p class="fst">(<strong>EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE:</strong> The above analysis of
the counter-revolutionary alignments in Italy comprises the first
section of E.R. Frank&#8217;s review of the events in Italy since the

Nazis in the North and the Badoglio regime in the South, together with
other aspects of the Italian political scene, in particular the new
Stalinist policy toward Badoglio and the King will be discussed in a
