<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%">
<p class="fst">The Second World War has unquestionably gone far beyond
its predecessor of twenty-five years ago in its ferocity, its
destructiveness and its all-inclusiveness. The war has swept into its
whirlpool the peoples of virtually the whole globe, the colonies as
well as the metropolitan centers. Even the neutral countries have not
escaped its all-embracing effects. In this war the dividing line is
beginning to disappear between civilians and soldiers.</p>
<p>The war poses all the questions of the class struggle point blank.
It subjects all peoples, ideas, organizations, institutions and systems
to an inexorable test. It abhors all ambiguity. The war rejects all
half measures. It exposes all that is rotten and decaying.</p>
<p>This war is bringing to a close that historic period of capitalism
where politics was characterized by unlimited compromises, by
huckstering between the different political factions and cliques, by
political stockjobbery of all kinds. The politics of pre-war Europe is
vanishing before our very eyes.</p>
<p>The day is past when the politics of reformism&#8212;the elaboration of
empty, high-sounding &#8220;compromise&#8221; schemes which threw a sop to the
masses, while leaving the domination of the monopolies and banks
untouched, and all the essential problems of the masses unsolved&#8212;were
adjudged as the highest political wisdom. The foundation has been
withdrawn from this kind of politics. Capitalism in its death agony
cannot offer the people even the smallest reforms, even the most
insignificant improvements. It cannot even offer them the miserable
standard of living of pre-war Europe. Capitalism in the period of its
terrible decay and decline, can offer the masses of Europe only a new
serfdom, political reaction, starvation, disease and self-destructive
wars.</p>
<p>The contradictions of this epoch are too profoundly acute, the
catastrophic downward plunge of capitalism is too headlong, the needs
of humanity too unpostponable, to provide much leeway for the
middle-of-the-road politicians whose stock in trade consists of
parliamentary trickery and jugglery.</p>
<p>New &#8220;democratic&#8221; capitalist governments, on the model of the Weimar
Republic of 1918 or the British Labor government of Ramsay McDonald,
may still be formed. The emergence of such governments remains a
distinct possibility, however, only because the European working class
is badly disorganized. The organization of such &#8220;democratic&#8221; capitalist
governments will not signify that Europe is about to repeat the
experience of the last war and go through a prolonged period of
 &#8220;democratic&#8221; capitalism. It only means that the capitalist rulers will
be forced to push forward &#8220;democratic&#8221; capitalist governments in a
desperate attempt to halt the radicalization of the masses and their
struggle for a new socialist society. Such governments will be of an
extremely unstable nature and of very short duration. They will
represent not a new equilibrium, but merely a short-lived stage ending
either in the victory of the workers&#8217; revolution which will establish a
socialist republic or the definitive victory of the counter-revolution,
which will establish a stark-reactionary military dictatorship.</p>
<p>The only revolutionary forces in Europe today are the working class
in alliance with the city and country poor. The only revolution which
the working class can and will lead is the socialist revolution. The
only alternative to the present rule of the industrialists and the
banks is the rule of the workers&#8217;, soldiers&#8217; and peasants&#8217; Soviets.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Two World Programs</h4>

<p class="fst">Roosevelt and Churchill both represent &#8220;democratic &#8220;
capitalist governments. But the trend even in the United States and
Great Britain is toward totalitarianism, toward dictatorship. Strikes
are outlawed in the both countries. The democratic rights of the people
are systematically being trampled upon and destroyed. Both the US and
Britain possess numerically powerful labor movements; the
Anglo-American capitalists are thus forced to proceed with a certain
caution in their home countries. In Europe, however, they feel no such
restraint, in the pursuit of their openly counter-revolutionary aims.</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Churchill understand that it is not in the cards to
establish stable &#8220;democratic&#8221; capitalist governments in Europe today.
Given free scope, given their democratic rights, the European working
class will not require overly much time to organize its revolutionary
party, and to overthrow all of its capitalist oppressors. The choice,
from the Roosevelt-Churchill point of view, is a Franco-type government
or the spectre of the socialist revolution. (Roosevelt and Churchill
prefer to call it &#8220;anarchy. &#8220;)</p>
<p>The war is bringing the fact home that there exist only two
fundamental world programs today&#8212;the stark-reactionary, imperialist
program of the ruling classes, representing the monopolists, the cartel
owners, the banks, and the world program of the socialist revolution,
that is, the program of the Fourth International. All the programs, or
lack of programs, of all the intermediate groups, the Stalinists, the
laborites, the social-democrats, the liberals, the centrists, the
pacifists, etc., etc., all reduce themselves in the last analysis to
eclectic hodge-podge concoctions in the service of big Capital. They
represent the pathetic waverings of the middle class between the big
capitalists and the working class. The petty bourgeois groupings,
tossed about like a feather in a gale storm, capitulating to the
imperialists at every critical juncture, demonstrate again the profound
Marxist truth that the middle class can have no basic program of its
own today but must espouse the program of one or the other of the two
fundamental classes of present-day society.</p>
<p>The example of Stafford Cripps is highly instructive in this regard.
In pre-war Europe, Sir Stafford might have spoken his empty banalities
for many years and have established a reputation for being a great
social thinker, a great &#8220;left-winger &#8220;, a do-gooder, a friend of the
common man and of suffering humanity. Today major political questions
cannot be so easily evaded. Almost overnight, history, in the guise of
Winston Churchill, grabbed up by the collar this estimable,
middle-class muddlehead and converted him into an open agent of British
imperialism which at that very moment was engaged in the attempt to
strangle the Indian revolution. The historic period when the heroes of
the golden mean can bask in the sunshine of middle-class public opinion
is rapidly drawing to a close.</p>
<p>Both the programs of Marxism and of world capitalism base themselves
upon the reality of the present-day world. They have this much in
common:&#8212;they both seek to analyze and evaluate the actual facts of
the class struggle. That being the case, it is important to establish
exactly what is the perspective of the big bourgeoisie? How do they
evaluate the present situation in Europe, the outcome of the war?</p>
<p>Of course, it is not so simple a matter to discover these facts, as
one might imagine. In spite of the thousands of books published each
year, in spite of the hundreds of speeches delivered over the air
waves, it takes considerable effort to ascertain the true opinions and
plans of the leaders and spokesmen of Big Business. The capitalist
statesmen of England and the U.S., no less than those of the fascist
countries, rule to a great extent by deceit. Hypocrisy, lying, trickery
and double talk have been developed by these capitalist statesmen into
a veritable art. Mastery of this art is an indispensable prerequisite
for any individual who aspires to become a bourgeois statesman.
Capitalist writing and oratory require the ability to weave high
sounding, sonorous phrases that mean nothing and commit one to nothing,
but are intended to lull and soothe the people, to quiet their fears,
arouse their hopes and retain their confidence.</p>
<p>When you are trying to glean the policy of a Roosevelt or a
Churchill from one of their speeches, you have to go about studying the
material at hand in the manner of a detective studying clues in a crime
case. You have to read the speech &#8220;between the lines.&#8221; A recent article
entitled <em>British Policy&#8212;A Conservative Forecast</em> by Quintin
Hogg in the October issue of <strong>Foreign Affairs</strong>, is very
illuminating for an understanding of Churchill&#8217;s declarations and
provides a key for a more profound understanding of the policies and
aims of Anglo-American capitalism. Quintin Hogg is an important member
of the influential group of young Disraelian Tories, and is a member of
the British House of Commons from Oxford.</p>

<p>The British <strong>Tribune</strong>, organ of Stafford
Cripps-Aneurin Bevan, characterizes this group in the following manner:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;The British traditionalists are still desperately in
need of the active support of the organized Socialist movement of Great
Britain, for the task which they now have to achieve is infinitely more
delicate than the one which faced them when Germany was loaded with
military menace. <em>What they now need is the cooperation of British
labor in the murder of the infant European revolution</em>. That is why
reaction in Britain must still wear the mask of progressivism without
at any moment yielding a single bulwark of privilege. That is why the
young Disraelian Tories, like Lord Hutchingbroke, Quintin Hogg and Hugh
Molson, continue to mouth the phrases of reformism anent the social
services of Britain while, at the same time, they become almost
incoherent with rage if our policy toward Europe is questioned. &#8220;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Candid Avowals</h4>
<p class="fst">Quintin Hogg, as we see, is an authoritative spokesman
and member of the British ruling class. His article, printed in a
magazine read by government officials, diplomats, professors etc., but
not widely read by the general public, gives a less guarded and far
more complete picture of where the imperialists are heading than the
speeches of Churchill or Roosevelt. As a matter of fact, the discerning
reader quickly grasps the fact that the policy outlined in this article
dove-tails with the policy enunciated by Roosevelt, Churchill, Eden and
Hull. As a rule their policy has to be reconstructed from hints and
phrases, it has to be read between the lines in the declarations of
these capitalist statesmen. The same policy is stated more thoroughly,
completely and frankly in this article.</p>
<p> &#8220;The first principle of the conservative statesman,&#8221; writes Hogg,
 &#8220;is to try and think himself ahead into the concrete situation with
which he is likely to be faced ... But what is the situation likely to
be?&#8221; Hogg gives the picture as the British Tories see it:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;This war is not going to end like the last. To
appropriate a line from T.S. Eliot, it will end &#8216;not with a bang but a
whimper.&#8217; There will not be an Armistice. There will be no last shots
fired at 11:05 a.m. There will not be a certain moment at which we are
at war and a subsequent moment at which we are at peace and free to
reconstruct the world. There will be a confused period in which the
problems of peace and the problems of war are inextricably intertwined
&#8212; <em>the</em> only peace of reconstruction we are likely to get.
After that it will be too late to reconstruct. &#8220;</p>

<p class="fst">He continues,</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;The two immediate factors of the situation in Europe
after the defeat of Hitler will be the necessity of military occupation
and European relief. We&#8212;and I mean the United States, the USSR and
the British Commonwealth&#8212;will not be driven to these acts by
vindictiveness or sentimentality but by the sheer logic of events. Some
will not like the policy they entail. All will have to accept it.</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;I think that this was what Mr. Churchill had in mind
in his somewhat guarded reference ...</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;The first purpose will involve the maintenance of a
large military force in Germany. The Nazi regime has destroyed every
organization that might conceivably have formed the basis for an
opposition ... When the Nazis fall there will be a void. Pockets of
isolated Nazi fanatics will hold out, will be suppressed and from time
to time will break out again in fits of hysterical resistance. Droves
of expropriated workers will roam far and wide without the means of
livelihood. Towns will have been battered. Food supplies will have been
disorganized. Epidemic disease will probably appear on an enormous
scale.</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;All Europe, as well as Germany, will be in confusion.
Peoples will rise against the remnants of the Nazi occupying power but
will not thereby achieve unity. The Giraud-de Gaulle controversy is
only a foretaste of factional disputes to come. Some of the Quislings
will rat. Others will continue their treachery in varying degrees.
Always there will be an insistent cry for food. Homeless people will
demand houses. War prisoners and foreign workers from German factories
will ask care and lodging on their way borne in places which cannot
accommodate them. Factories will be closed. Chaos will reign
everywhere. The one unifying force will be the armies of the United
Nations. The one sure source of food will be the United Nations Relief
Organization. The one instrument of political security will be the
authority of the victorious Powers.</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;It is idle to pretend that this period of chaos will
prove short. Houses are not built in a day. It will take time to
repatriate Hitler&#8217;s slave labor and years to reorganise industrial
production. The agriculture of Europe is not going to recover for
fifteen years or more. The cattle have been slaughtered. The fields are
partly unfertilized. The farmers and their laborers have been
scattered. And in Germany itself the disease of Nazism will take at
least a generation to eradicate.</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;Europe as we knew it has disappeared. Possibly it has
ceased forever to be the economic or political center of the world ... &#8220;</p>
<p class="fst">In the light of this harsh and cruel picture of post-war
Europe, how hollow, how empty, how pathetic is the chatter of the
liberals and laborites about post-war reconstruction, about the century
of the common man, about the brave new world &#8220;we all seek to build. &#8220;
Like religion, these slogans are intended as opium for the people.</p>
<p>The British ruling class knows the real facts and their only program
is, in partnership with the United States, to preserve and ensure their
power and privileges by converting the peoples of Europe into serfs,
under the rule of Anglo-American bayonets and threats of starvation.
That is the cold-blooded, barbaric program which the Anglo-American
capitalists offer as their &#8220;solution&#8221; to the European problem. As Hogg
puts it: &#8220;Some will not like the policy ... All will have to accept it. &#8220;<br />

&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Reed Plans</h4>
<p class="fst">From all sides comes confirmation that Hogg&#8217;s is no
individual opinion. On the contrary, this represents the deliberate,
calculated, predetermined and authoritative policy of Wall and Lombard
Streets. Two important pronouncements verify this fact. The September
24 <strong>NY Times</strong> reports that US Secretary of State
Cordell Hull declared to newspaper reporters that &#8220;food and order&#8221; will
be the two-fold key for Wall Street&#8217;s plans to subjugate Europe. The <strong>Times</strong>
states:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;In emphasizing the importance of the project (United
Nations Relief), the Secretary of State recalled how four nations
slipped into anarchy after the last war and warned that as many as
fourteen nations would follow that course after the present war, unless
someone fed them. &#8220;</p>
<p class="fst">This statement should be studied in connection with the
speech delivered in England the same week by Sir Samuel Hoare, British
Ambassador to Spain. Sir Samuel Hoare declared that Britain has become
the &#8220;leading military power in Europe.&#8221; &#8220;Having achieved this power, &#8220;
he asserted, &#8220;Britain does not intend to abandon it and &#8216;tomorrow it
may be the safeguard of European stability&#8217; ... &#8220;</p>
<p> &#8220;Sir Samuel placed &#8216;food and order&#8217; as the first needs of Europe, &#8220;
the <strong>New York Times</strong> correspondent reports. &#8220;We are
prepared in full cooperation with our great Allies to prevent famine by
insuring the effective distribution of food supplies and to forestall
anarchy by Allied garrisons at key points on the continent. &#8220;</p>

<p>These are the plans, these are the intentions of British
imperialism. But there is a great gap between desire and
accomplishment. Hogg of course recognizes that Britain has lost her
world preeminence. &#8220;... Our industrial ascendancy has disappeared.
Financially and economically the US is incomparably the greatest Po</span>wer in the
world.&#8221; He hopes, however, and this is the hope of the British Tories,
that Britain will be indispensable, even though in a junior capacity,
in Wall Street&#8217;s drive for world hegemony. &#8220;Can American trade function
in Africa and Asia without British political assistance?&#8221; he demands.
Hogg thinks it cannot.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The War With Japan</h4>
<p class="fst">But even if Britain is able to establish itself as the
junior partner of the firm of Anglo-American capitalism and even if the
war with Hitler is successfully concluded, there still remain the war
with Japan and the necessity of reestablishing Anglo-American hegemony
in the Far East.</p>
<p> &#8220;The result,&#8221; writes Hogg, &#8220;will be a period of peace and war. Part
of our industry will be switching to the reconstruction of Europe and
Great Britain. Part will still be supplying the armed forces. Part of
the armed forces will be transferred to the Far East; part to the
European Army of Occupation. But some will return to industry ...&#8221; He
forecasts that:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> &#8220;This will raise intricate problems within the armed
forces. Who is going back first to get civilian jobs? Veterans of Tunis
and Burma will strain to come back to England, only to be told that
they are wanted in the European Army of Occupation, or to fight the
Japanese. Boys will be sent out from this country to take the places of
demobilized men just as they come to think the war is over.
Demobilization will become a thorny political problem.</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;The end of the war with Germany will set up a new
series of shortages. It is estimated that bombing, lack of repairs and
shifts in population, added to existing slums and overcrowding, will
give Britain a shortage of 4,000,000 dwelling houses in 1944&#8212;more
than ten years&#8217; output at maximum prewar rates. Our clothes are wearing
out. Everything is getting shabby and out of repair. We shall be short
of timber, short of ships, short of food, short of oil and, above all,
short of men.</p>
<p class="quote"> &#8220;Certain political conclusions follow from this. Mr.
Churchill is one of the few men who have had the courage to draw them.
If government is not to break down it will have to he strong
government. The mere demand for demobilization from within the services
will ensure the continuance of conscription to replace those who are
demobilized. There will still be rationing, because there will still be
shortages; a system of priorities will still govern new production.
Some requisitioning of housing accommodation is probable. Rent
restriction is certain to continue so long as there is a shortage of
houses; and there may be a continuation of billeting and of compulsory
labor service ... &#8220;</p>

<p class="fst">Such is the future that the British ruling class holds
out for the British people. Regardless of military victory, nay, on the
assumption of military victory, the war economy plus the organization
and maintenance of huge armies and military establishments will
continue for a very long time to come. How long? The only authorative
statement given out on this score thus far has come from Knox, US
Secretary of the Navy. He blurted out in an unguarded moment that the
US and Britain will have to police the world for the next hundred
years. By then Knox and his friends feel that it will be safe. Or maybe
they will demand an additional extension.</p>
<p>Hogg undestands too well that such a program cannot survive even the
ordinary rigors of British parliamentary contest. &#8220;Will these become
party issues?&#8221; he apprehensively inquires. &#8220;No government,&#8221; Hogg is
convinced, &#8220;can withstand grievances on the scale which will exist, if
they are given organized expression by a powerful Parliamentary
opposition.&#8221; He then quotes Churchill&#8217;s plea for a continuation of the
present coalition after the war. &#8220;Anybody who opposes Mr. Churchill&#8217;s
plea for national unity after victory, will, I believe, be simply swept
off the map,&#8221; he melodramatically warns the weak-kneed Labor Party
leadership.</p>
<p>This perspicacious, class-conscious Tory unwittingly gives testimony
on behalf of our contention that the treacherous labor bureaucracy of
the Bevin-Morrison type, as of the Murray-Green variety, constitutes
today an indispensable cog in the maintenance of the stability of the
capitalist regimes both in Britain and the United States. Apparently
the stability of the mightiest capitalisms rests on none too firm a
foundation.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Lies of the Past</h4>
<p class="fst">In the temporary stabilization that capitalism achieved
in Europe after 1923, the middle-of-the-road politicians of the yellow
Second International told the workers that their methods of peaceful
and gradual evolution were safer, demanded less sacrifice and bloodshed
than the aggressive, sanguinary methods of the Russian Revolution. They
assured the working class that the reformist policies of the British
Labor Party or the German Social-Democratic Party, the methods of
peaceful election contests, the routine organization of trade unions,
and the winning of modest reforms etc., guaranteed the gradual,
peaceful and painless transition to the new socialist society. This
argument had a certain appeal and exercised considerable influence on
sections of the working class of Europe. Of course, the yellow
 &#8220;socialists&#8221; did not bring socialism to the European workers. Neither
were the workers in Italy, Germany and Spain spared the rigors and
violence of civil war. Nor were the European workers spared the horrors
of the Second World War.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Europe Today</h4>
<p class="fst">Under Czarism, with its tyrannical, barbaric and
murderous rule, the Russian working class quickly shed its reformist
illusions and learned the lesson of revolutionary Internationalism. The
Russian working class was the first to build a powerful Bolshevik party
and the, first to make a successful socialist revolution.</p>
<p>In similar fashion, the Europe of today provides little soil for
reformism to take root and flourish. The Europe of today leaves little
room for philistine illusions. Gradualism will be thought of in the
next period as a bizarre, totally unrealistic philosophy. The war is
pounding home the grim lesson that the workers&#8217; revolution is the only
way to end the imperialist slaughter, that the Socialist United States
of Europe is the only alternative to the present madhouse of capitalist
Europe.</p>

<p>The European workers can be depended on to rebuild their
revolutionary socialist International, the Fourth International, on
lines that correspond to the requirements and needs of the present
epoch. The present epoch will be recorded as one not only of
imperialist wars but also of liberating revolutions.</p>
