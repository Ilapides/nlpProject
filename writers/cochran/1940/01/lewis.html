<p class="fst">The CIO drive in the building industry, started with so much noise
and fanfare by John L. Lewis and his brother, A.D. Lewis, Chairman of
the United Construction Workers Organizing Committee, may yet end as
a minor disaster for the CIO.</p>

<p>Lewis is playing with dynamite.</p>

<p>First, because he is invading an industry that is organized by the
building trades unions, the most powerful and richest group of
International unions in the AFL.</p>

<p>Secondly, because he is attempting to sign contracts with the
building trades bosses by establishing lower hourly wages and poorer
working conditions than prevail in the organized section of the
industry at the present time.</p>

<p>Third, because he is enlisting the aid of and cooperating in the
reactionary anti-union drive of Thurman Arnold and the Department of
Justice.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>FBI Snooper Hired</h4>

<p class="fst">In last week&rsquo;s issue of the <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, we
pointed out that Russell Turner Sr., an aide of Assistant Attorney
General Thurman Arnold, was appointed by Lewis to the staff of the
UCWOC and pointed out that this short sighted move constituted &ldquo;a
shameful violation of union solidarity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <strong>CIO News</strong> of January 8 seems to be all puffed up about
this marvelous new acquisition to its organizing staff and with great
pride points out that &ldquo;for the past year Mr. Turner has been on
the staff of the Justice Department where he took part in anti-trust
law inquiries into the building trades.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>CIO Features Prosecution</h4>

<p class="fst">The same issue of the <strong>CIO News</strong> carries the following story
in connection with the Construction committees organization work in
Washington, D.C.:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Several indictments of AFL officials are pending
in Washington as a result of jurisdictional disputes and Justice
Department agents are reported investigating the current tie-up. [A
strike of AFL laborers on the 12-story RFC building structure.] The
Department&rsquo;s theory is that these disputes are in restraint of
trade and hence illegal under the anti-trust statutes.</p>

<p class="quote">&rdquo;Government officials have recently recognized
jurisdictional strikes and craft union, restrictions as a major
factor in retarding the construction industry. Witnesses before the
anti-monopoly Committee have offered sensational testimony showing
the extent of craft union abuses in this industry ...&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A Suicidal Policy</h4>

<p class="fst">The <strong>CIO News</strong> gives the unmistakable impression that it
favors the insidious union busting campaign of the Department of
Justice. It is either passively tolerating or actively cooperating in
this campaign, which if successful would not only weaken and
eventually destroy the AFL building trades unions, but the whole
trade union movement of this country, CIO included.</p>

<p>It is the duty of all progressives in the CIO today to demand that
Lewis call a halt to these suicidal policies and devote his time and
energies to uniting both wings of the trade union movement, not
pushing them further apart.</p>
