<br />
<p class="fst">In the January 6 issue of the <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, we called
attention to the signing of a new agreement between Local 160,
attached to the out-of-town department of the International Ladies
Garment Workers Union, and the Maiden Form Brassiere Company of
Bayonne, New Jersey.</p>

<p>The negotiations revealed, we pointed out, the absence of all
democratic procedure in the out-of-town department and the
reactionary policies pursued by its general manager, Harry Wander.</p>

<p>In the January 15 issue of <strong>Justice</strong>, official publication of
the ILGWU, Harry Wander attempts to answer our accusations.</p>

<p>He states:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Their (<strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>) accusation is that
we refused to support the action of the shop when in the midst of
negotiating a contract, one committee was abruptly withdrawn and
another committee substituted.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;To this accusation I plead guilty as charged. My
action was that of a responsible unionist,&rdquo; etc.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A Dictator&rsquo;s Idea of Unionism</h4>

<p class="fst">Doesn&rsquo;t it strike you as strange Mr. Wander, that you, one
man, should possess the power to overturn the decision of a thousand
union members? You state you did not think their decision was a wise
one, therefore you would not recognize their regularly elected
negotiating committee and you decided to discontinue the negotiations
with the company. Doesn&rsquo;t that bear out every one of our
accusations that the local unions attached to your department enjoy
no autonomy and that the <em>appointed</em> out-of-town department
leadership exercises autocratic powers?</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t your own explanation, Mr. Wander, reveal that you do
not believe that the workers have sufficient intelligence to conduct
their own union affairs and decide their own policies, but must be
supervised by union officials who possess dictatorial powers and can
veto the decisions of the rank and file membership?</p>

<p>Your explanation of why you opposed the election of a new shop
committee is positively humorous. You state that &ldquo;changing
committees while negotiations are in progress is almost always a bad
procedure,&rdquo; and besides such an action &ldquo;offends members
of the original committee.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that a real gem ? Here
is a group of workers, staging a revolt against your autocratic
conduct and your reactionary policies as displayed in the
negotiations; they remove the old shop committee, because it is
apparently too subservient to you. You proceed to veto their action
and toss their democratic votes into the waste paper basket, because
it is going to hurt somebody&rsquo;s feelings. How about the feelings
of the one thousand workers whose democratic rights you have violated?</p>

<p>Your reply, in my opinion, serves only to <em>underscore the crying
need for reforms in the out-of-town department of the ILGWU by the
introduction of democratic procedure in the negotiation of union
contracts and the granting of full autonomy to all local unions</em>.</p>

<p>Your article, I suppose, would be incomplete without its tearful
reference to &ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s ruthless attack upon Finland&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;cold and deliberate mass slaughter, including the
bombing of open cities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Hoover, Roosevelt, the U.S. Steel Corporation or the Chase
National Bank get all worked up about &ldquo;poor little Finland,&rdquo;
it is easily understandable. Finland is a semi-colony of the U.S. and
the Wall Street men have a stake in a Finnish victory. What are you
all excited about, Mr. Wander? Your trepidation is as indecent as
that of a butler, who is in seventh heaven when his master&rsquo;s
stocks and bonds soar upward and who is down in the dumps when the
master&rsquo;s securities sharply decline.</p>

<p>Stalin&rsquo;s invasion of Finland has been used by all of the
open shop manufacturers and their lackeys to divert attention away
from America&rsquo;s ten million unemployed, the starvation and
suffering stalking Cleveland and hundreds of other American cities,
the billions of dollars that are being spent on armaments in
preparation for war. These phony democrats have one-track minds. They
can understand suffering and starvation in Finland. But they cannot
recognize it in the United States.</p>

<p>You and your friends are the younger brothers of these phony
democrats. You are ready to fight for democracy in &ldquo;Poor Little
Finland.&rdquo; But you do not have a very great interest in
democracy in the ILGWU. Like all worshippers of &ldquo;bourgeois
democracy,&rdquo; you do not have a very high regard for it in your
own labor organization. Before you get worked up about &ldquo;Poor
Little Finland&rdquo; again, remember the words of a very wise man:
&ldquo;Charity begins at home.&rdquo;</p>
