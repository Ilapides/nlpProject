<p class="fst">The signing of the Stalin-Hitler pact and the subsequent march
into Poland caught the American Communist party off guard and unprepared.</p>

<p>Right up to the moment of the signing of the pact, the Stalinists
kept up an incessant and uproarious din in the trade unions with
thousands of resolutions and an equal number of speeches for
&ldquo;Collective Security&rdquo; &ndash; an alliance of the United
States and the other &ldquo;democracies&rdquo; with the Soviet Union,
to &ldquo;quarantine the aggressors&rdquo; &ndash; Germany, Italy and
Japan &ndash; and for full, enthusiastic and unconditional support
for Roosevelt and his &ldquo;peace program&rdquo; &ndash; the cynical
name for the construction of the largest peace-time military machine
in American history.</p>

<p>They kept up this propaganda through the better part of 1939, in
the period when Roosevelt signed the Woodrum Bill, which dumped three
quarters of a million WPA workers out into the streets, destroyed the
&ldquo;prevailing wage-scale&rdquo; principle hitherto observed on
the WPA, slashed the wages of the remaining WPA workers and
introduced the infamous &ldquo;eighteen month&rdquo; clause.</p>

<p>They continued lining up the labor movement behind the Roosevelt
machine, even when the conservative building trades unions were
forced to answer the Roosevelt anti-union drive with a national
strike on the WPA. They continued shouting for Roosevelt even when he
openly announced his intention of smashing the WPA strike, and issued
the arrogant dictum that &ldquo;you cannot strike against the
government&rdquo;, followed by the arrest and indictment of 162
Minneapolis WPA strikers on charges of conspiracy.</p>

<p>The cynical bureaucrats who run the Communist party were not even
abashed when Roosevelt, through the FBI, began handing out dozens of
indictments against union officials as part of the Thurman-Arnold
anti-trust drive, <em>the worst-union busting campaign undertaken by
any U.S. President in the last two decades.<br />
&nbsp;</em></p>

<h4>They Loved Roosevelt Though He Smote Them</h4>

<p class="fst">No! The Stalinists unconcernedly continued using their influence
and strength to hog-tie the labor movement and to confuse and
befuddle the minds of the union militants. The Stalinist- controlled
Workers Alliance is sued a call to labor to back Roosevelt for a
third term, the man who had just slashed relief and WPA
appropriations. The Stalinist-controlled Maritime Federation of the
Pacific (mostly landlubbers, the sailors had left) ran a &ldquo;Draft
Roosevelt in 1940&rdquo; campaign throughout last summer for the very
man who was responsible for saddling the East Coast maritime unions
with the anti-union, &ldquo;fink hall&rdquo; U.S. Maritime
Commission, etc., etc. (The West Coast seamen not under Stalinist
control, kept union hiring halls)!</p>

<p>Why not? The Stalinist leadership was responsible only to the
Stalin bureaucracy. The instructions were to line up the American
labor movement behind Roosevelt who, it was believed, was friendly to
the idea of concluding an alliance with the Soviet Union. What about
the real needs and requirements of the American trade unionists? That
was not the concern of the cynical bureaucrats who run the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>You can understand how criminal was this policy of the Communist
Party, when you realize that it is precisely this policy of putting
faith in Roosevelt and all the other phony &ldquo;friends of labor,&rdquo;
<em>rather than relying on the independent strength and power of the
labor movement</em>, that has brought the CIO, as well as the rest of
organized labor, to its present impasse. The futility and bankruptcy
of this policy was nowhere better illustrated than in the ill-fated
&ldquo;Little Steel&rdquo; strike, when the steel workers of Ohio,
under the influence of these false teachings and policies, welcomed
and cheered the very troops of the National Guard that several days
later broke their picket lines and smashed their strike.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Flip-Flop Came Overnight</h4>

<p class="fst">With the signing of the pact, the Stalinist policy changed
overnight. Never before in recent history, has a political party
executed such a fantastic, rapid fire, flip-flop. Everything that was
black became white. Everything that was white became black. England
and France, the &ldquo;peace- loving democracies&rdquo; became
transformed into &ldquo;war-mongering aggressors.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Peace-loving democratic&rdquo; England was suddenly revealed
by the <strong>Daily Worker</strong> to be &ldquo;the age-old British
imperialism, whose hands drip with blood.&rdquo; Germany, the &ldquo;bad,
war-mongering, fascist&rdquo; suddenly changed roles and became a
&ldquo;peace lover.&rdquo; Roosevelt, who supposedly had been
pursuing a &ldquo;peace program&rdquo; for the past four years, was
discovered to be America&rsquo;s worst &ldquo;war monger&rdquo;
intent upon hurling the U.S. into the imperialist blood-bath.
&ldquo;Collective Security,&rdquo; the &ldquo;democracies against
fascism,&rdquo; &ldquo;quarantine the aggressors,&rdquo; &ldquo;boycott
Hitler Germany&rdquo; &ndash; all disappeared with the snows of
yesteryear.</p>

<p>Since the signing of the pact, the Stalinists have been screaming
that labor must join ranks to &ldquo;Keep America out of the
Imperialist war&rdquo; and have begun introducing resolutions by the
yard denouncing Roosevelt&rsquo;s war budget, denouncing his war
program, denouncing his union-busting campaigns and calling for the
building of a third party for Jobs, Peace and Civil Liberties.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Union Militants Must Study C.P. Politics</h4>

<p class="fst">It is impossible for the ordinary trade unionist to make head or
tail of the dizzy turns, twists and changes in the Communist party
line on the basis of trade union experience alone. And yet, a
knowledge of the methods and the moving forces of the Stalinist party
is an indispensable part of the education of the genuine union
militant. A lack of this elementary knowledge has led many union
militants astray, driving them back into the arms of reactionary
leaders or making them easy victims of Stalinist demagogy.</p>

<p>It must be understood that the Stalinist party is run
bureaucratically by a top officialdom, responsible only to its
masters in Moscow. The rank and file members of the party had no more
to say about the recent change in the party line than any outsider.
The new line was handed down from the top, by decree. The basic aim
and policy of the Stalinist party consists of this: that at every
stage of the game, the influence and strength of the labor movement
should be so maneuvered, directed and channelized to bolster up and
support the foreign policy &ndash; not of the people of the Soviet
Union &ndash; but of the corrupt, reactionary Stalin bureaucracy,
that runs the government of the Soviet Union. This was true for the
period before the signing of the Stalin-Hitler pact. It remains true
today.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Why Stalinists Now Oppose Roosevelt</h4>

<p class="fst">Instead of Stalin making an alliance with the &ldquo;democracies,&rdquo;
as was envisaged in the period of the People&rsquo;s Front, Stalin
confounded his parties all over the world, by making an alliance with
Hitler, against England, France and the United States. If the United
States enters the present war, as it is preparing to do, it will
unquestionably put its power on the side of the Allied imperialists
against the Hitler-Stalin alliance. On behalf of Stalin&rsquo;s
alliance with Hitler, therefore, the U.S. must remain neutral at all
costs. <em>This is the explanation and the only explanation for the
Stalinist change of policy.</em></p>

<p>The present foreign policy of Stalin demands of the American party
that it line up the labor movement against Roosevelt and his war
program. Shortly after the signing of the pact, the Stalinists went
to work on a new campaign to put the &ldquo;line&rdquo; across. Mike
Quin, an editor of the West Coast Stalinist paper, <strong>People&rsquo;s
World</strong> wrote a pamphlet called <strong>The Yanks are not Coming</strong>,
which rolled off the printing press just in time to greet the
delegates of the San Francisco CIO convention. The pamphlet, which
gives the new line of the Stalinists in popular &ldquo;trade union&rdquo;
style, was published under the auspices of the Stalinist-controlled
San Francisco district of the Maritime Federation of the Pacific and
has since been circulated in systematic fashion by the Stalinists
throughout the CIO and in numerous unions of the AFL.</p>

<p>Using the pamphlet as an opening wedge, the Stalinists have pushed
through in many local unions endorsements as the preliminary step to
the actual setting up of &ldquo;peace committees&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
Yanks are not Coming Committees.&rdquo; All of these committees which
have been springing up in many local unions all over the country,
have this in common: they are all inspired and organized by the
Stalinists and all propagate the present line of the Stalinist party.</p>

<p>The Stalinists plan to eventually call a Congress or national
conference of all of these phony &ldquo;peace&rdquo; groups in order
to form a new national peace organization to agitate and work for the
new line of the Stalinist party in this post Stalin-Hitler pact
period.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>New Line No Better Than the Old</h4>

<p class="fst">In a sense, the new Stalinist line is the complete opposite of the
previous &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Front&rdquo; program. But it has this
similarity, or more correctly, identity: the new &ldquo;anti-war&rdquo;
line, like the preceding one, is steered, planned and directed by the
same gang of unscrupulous union wreckers that manipulated and pursued
the old &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Front&rdquo; pro-Roosevelt, pro-war
line. Unconcerned and uninterested in the actual needs and desires of
the labor movement, they remain today as before intent only on
exploiting the trade unions for the selfish interests of the
Stalinist party, which is the American agency for the corrupt and
savage bureaucrats who rule the Soviet Union. Their &ldquo;anti-war&rdquo;
line is no better for the workers than their pro-war line of
yesterday.</p>
