<br />
<p class="fst">Prior to the signing of the Stalin-Hitler pact, the Stalinists
constituted a major force in the American trade union movement.
Posing as the best union fighters, the true champions of honesty,
militancy and democracy in the labor movement, supported by a
well-organized national apparatus, a strong press, with huge funds at
their disposal, the Stalinists caught the rising CIO movement of
young unsuspecting workers completely unawares and easily wormed
their way into control of numerous unions.</p>

<p>Once in the saddle, they showed the American labor bureaucrats how
to really organize an autocratic, reactionary and corrupt machine.</p>

<p>They signed agreements that disgraced the labor movement. They
blandly united with racketeers, gangsters and any reactionary forces
in the unions, in order to gain control. They systematically hounded,
slandered and persecuted all genuine militants and progressives who
dared to revolt against these high-handed practices.</p>

<p>It was the &ldquo;Peoples Front&rdquo; period of Stalinism. In
this scheme, the unions constituted the most important battle
grounds. The labor movement, suspecting nothing, was to find itself,
according to the Stalinist plan, one fine day, lined up to a man
behind the Roosevelt war machine and hellbent on shoving through a
&ldquo;collective security&rdquo; war alliance of America, England,
France and Russia, against the &ldquo;bad, war-making fascists.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Were Roosevelt&rsquo;s Most Servile Agents in Unions</h4>

<p class="fst">To push through this infamous scheme, the Stalinists converted
themselves into the most servile, belly-crawling supporters of
Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal, picturing it as an almost suitable
substitute for socialism itself. They hounded and slandered any
worker who had the temerity to question this dishonest, reactionary
policy. Thus, this crew of union wreckers, posing as the left wing of
the unions, sidetracked the whole labor movement and helped destroy
its fighting power.</p>

<p>The Roosevelt government, in this period, was on passively
friendly terms with the Soviet Union. And since the American
Stalinists were laboring with might and main to line up the trade
unions behind his war machine, Roosevelt displayed an attitude of
toleration towards the Communist Party and its activities. Many of
the lesser New Deal officials actually became outright supporters or
fellow-travellers of the Stalinist movement.</p>

<p>The Stalinists had the additional support of John L. Lewis and
were in an official bloc with the latter throughout this &ldquo;People&rsquo;s
Front&rdquo; period. Why did Lewis make a bloc with the very people
against whom he had waged a bitter struggle in the miners union? It
was not Lewis who had changed his basic philosophy! The Communist
Party, during the &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Front&rdquo; period cynically
dumped overboard all talk and pretense of working for socialism or
militant union policies. It began to drape the Stars and Stripes
around itself and bellowed more patriotically than even the Daughters
of the American Revolution.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Lewis Was Sure He Could Break Them</h4>

<p class="fst">Lewis and his lieutenants, drunk with victory as a result of the
first brilliant successes in rubber, auto, steel, maritime and other
industries, thought they could work with everybody, use everybody and
outsmart everybody. The Stalinists had a machine, a national press,
experienced journalists, speakers and organizers. In return for the
services of this machine, Lewis made the alliance, handing over to
the Stalinists the maritime unions, the whole west coast CIO
movement, the radio workers, the agricultural workers, the white
collar unions, etc. He was positive that he could always get rid of
the Stalinists, if he so desired.</p>

<p>The period from 1936 to 1939 was the hey-day of Stalinist rule and
marks a fever chart in the history of the unions which the Stalinists
controlled. Determined to line up the unions behind their &quot;collective
security&quot; program regardless of cost, feeling no responsibility
for the unions, cynically indifferent to the real needs and desires
of the union membership, the Stalinists pursued a deliberate policy
of &ldquo;rule or ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In those unions that would not bend to their will, as in the
Sailors Union of the Pacific, the Auto Union, etc., they engaged in
bitter, irresponsible factional wars that threatened the very life of
the unions. Where they seized control, their rule was marked by</p>

<p>the signing of wretched contracts, making outrageous deals with
the employers, belly-crawling before any two by four politician or
public official, and a disloyal, ruthless suppression of all
opposition. The Stalinists left in their wake a trail of wrecked
unions, honest union militants corrupted into cynical officials and
thousands of disillusioned, disoriented rank and file workers.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Wave of Revolt Against the Stalinists</h4>

<p class="fst">The Stalinists were driven to be more cautious and diplomatic in
the last period just preceding the signing of the Stalin-Hitler Pact,
as great rank and file movements sprang up in union after union,
challenging their autocratic rule and exposing the union-wrecking
activities of the Stalinist gang.</p>

<p>In 1939, this rank and file revolt gained strength and swept
through both CIO and AFL unions &ndash; in the Pocket Book makers,
the Maritime unions on both the coasts and the Gulf, the Teachers
Union, the West Coast Office Workers, the secession of important
unions from the Los Angeles CIO Council, the New York Painters and
Food Workers. This imposing rank and file revolt against the
Stalinist machine was climaxed by the titanic struggle in the Auto
Workers Union.</p>

<p>By 1939 the American trade unions presented a far different
picture than at the beginning of the CIO movement. The unsuspecting,
inexperienced union militants of 1934 and 1935 had undergone a
profound transformation. The new officials of the new unions had
become more cautious and more conservative both under the pressure of
capitalist public opinion and because of their lack of class
consciousness and working class philosophy.</p>

<p>The union movement represented to these officials, however, their
life&rsquo;s career. They became therefore extremely suspicious of
and antagonistic to the Stalinists who viewed the unions merely as a
pawn and tool to realize the &ldquo;Line&rdquo; of the Stalinist
Party. The union officials knew one thing for sure: that their
importance and prestige, as well as their salaries, depended upon a
strong, virile union and they were interested in preserving that.</p>

<p>Even more hostile to Stalinism were the rank and file leaders who
were arising in different localities, veterans of the strike
struggles of the CIO, hardened and toughened by their experiences.
They had learned the hard way the meaning of Stalinism and the fact
that it was the most reactionary force in the American labor
movement. They were determined to destroy the Stalinist cancer, in
order that the labor movement might advance and grow.</p>
