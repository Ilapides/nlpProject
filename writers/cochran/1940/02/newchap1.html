<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="fst">The recently concluded convention of the United Mine Workers
ushered in a new stage in the history of American labor and revealed
once again that the CIO is the progressive wing of the trade union
movement, because it is based on the workers of America&rsquo;s mass
production industries.</p>

<p>After the smashing defeat of the &ldquo;Little Steel&rdquo; strike
in the fall of 1937, the CIO lost the momentum of its splendid
offensive and retreated slowly before the counter- drive of the
employers. As the militancy of the workers cooled off after the first
taste of defeat, the rear line trenches of the capitalist class
opened fire. What they dared not attempt during the period of labor
upsurge, they found the courage to do in the days of labor&rsquo;s
retreat. The courts began harassing the labor movement with
anti-union judicial legislation. The state legislatures regained
their lost courage. Beginning with passage of oppressive labor
legislation in Washington and Oregon, the reactionary wave swept
eastward, until today almost three- fourths of the states have new
tyrannical laws designed to cripple the labor unions.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Union-Busting Campaign Taken Up by FDR</h4>

<p class="fst">In the past year, this union- busting campaign has been taken over
by the federal government itself. The campaign against the WPA
strikers and the infamous Thurman Arnold &ldquo;Anti-trust law&rdquo;
indictments are but highlights in the anti-union campaign launched by
Roosevelt as a part of his feverish preparations for war.</p>

<p>The index of business activity stands today about 10% higher than
in 1929. Ten million workers still remain unemployed without the
possibility of being re-absorbed into private industry. This huge
army constitutes an ever-present threat to the unions, menaces the
wage standards of the employed workers, and hinders the progress of
the labor movement. Partly because of these employment conditions,
the unions have made no important advances during the past year. And
in the labor movement, as in other great ventures, it is impossible
to stand still. Either you move forward or you are ruthlessly pushed
backwards.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Lewis Could Not Ignore The Permanent Crisis</h4>

<p class="fst">Lewis chose to ignore the existence of this permanent economic
crisis and its significance for the labor movement, at the CIO
convention held in November at San Francisco. But Lewis could not
afford to ignore these matters for long. He is not some Matthew Woll,
who bases himself on the aristocratic Photo-Engravers and a million
dollar insurance company. Lewis is the leader of the unions in the
mass production industries: coal, steel, auto, rubber, glass, oil &ndash;
the nerve centers of American economy.</p>

<p>These mass production workers are not experts in economics or
statistics. They have not delved into reports of the Federal Reserve
Bank or the Department of Labor. But they have seen with their own
eyes production stepped up to the highest level of the last ten years
and they know that, in spite of this, one third of the labor
population still remains unemployed, and given present conditions,
will always remain unemployed.</p>

<p>This industrial proletariat, employed in the huge plants, mills
and factories of America, feels in its very bones how important and
indispensable it is to the economic life of the country and it
understands better than anyone else the full potentialities and
latent strength inherent in the labor movement. These workers are
determined to win economic security for themselves and their families
and they are groping around and looking for the labor leaders who
will show them the path to achieve this goal.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Why Lewis Broke with Roosevelt</h4>

<p class="fst">For the last two years, they have seen the courts and the
legislatures attempt to hurl them back to the slavery of the open
shop. They have further seen Roosevelt and the New Dealers, whom they
considered to be labor&rsquo;s friends, take the lead of this
reactionary open-shop campaign. The bitterness and hatred of this
industrial proletariat is storing up and creating a powder keg of
social dissatisfaction and revolt that will inevitably explode. Lewis
Murray and their associates understand this fact. They know full well
that they must adapt themselves to this mood, if they are to retain
the leadership of the CIO. This is the explanation and the only
explanation for Lewis&rsquo;s dramatic break with Roosevelt.</p>

<p>But where is Lewis going? Where is he leading the CIO? Lewis
himself does not know. He is extremely bold in method and violent in
speech, but very timid and hesitant in his policies.</p>

<p>The indicated policy for the CIO is to break once and for all with
all capitalist politics, correctly dubbed &ldquo;company unionism&rdquo;
in the political field, and march forward onto the broad highways of
an independent political party of labor, with an aggressive, fighting
program for jobs and security. Such a policy would open up new vistas
for the entire labor movement and would, by comparison, pale into
insignificance the advances made by the CIO in its golden period from
1935 to 1937. But this step Lewis will not take. He does not have
confidence in the independent strength of labor.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>AFL-CIO Split Doesn&rsquo;t Explain Weakness</h4>

<p class="fst">Many bourgeois writers, commenting on the lack of progress of the
American labor movement in the recent period, have ascribed this
decline solely to the split in labor&rsquo;s ranks and the consequent
warfare that ensued between the two labor factions.</p>

<p>Is it true that the decline of two years can be ascribed solely or
mainly to the split in labor&rsquo;s ranks? No! Of equal and even of
greater importance is the <em>policy</em> of the labor movement. Labor
is today marking time, first of all, because of the inadequate,
conservative, class-collaboration policies of its leadership; the
lack of a militant, realistic program to point the way for a genuine
solution to the problems of unemployment, insecurity and the
threatening war.</p>

<p>For example, the AFL is today being subjected to an attack
unprecedented in recent labor history, in the form of the &ldquo;antitrust&rdquo;
indictments, which threaten the very existence of numerous AFL
Internationals. How is the AFL responding to this mortal threat? It
is confining its resistance to the hiring of lawyers, the drawing up
of briefs and the button-holing of individual politicians. A pitiable
campaign! Is this poor resistance, perchance, to be explained by the
split in labor&rsquo;s ranks? No! It is explained by the timid and
cowardly policies of the AFL national leadership.</p>

<p>These timid and cowardly policies make those of the CIO leadership
shine by comparison. But only by this comparison. By the measure of
the problems which the CIO faces, by the measure of the desperate
needs of its membership, the policies of the CIO leadership are
almost as bankrupt as those of the AFL. Lewis&rsquo; lack of
confidence in the independent strength of labor, in the ability of
the working class to march forward onto the broad highways of an
independent political party of labor, merely means that he does not
visualize the policies which organized labor would require on that
road. His vacillating policies won&rsquo;t work on that road. But
that only means that the necessary policies must be put forward in
place of those of Lewis. There is no short cut to pushing the CIO
along the road it must go to solve the needs of the masses. Only as
voices arise which articulately and accurately reflect these needs,
will the CIO move in the necessary direction.</p>
