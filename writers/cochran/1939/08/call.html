<p class="fst"><strong>Dear Friends:</strong></p>

<p class="fst">After weeks of unprecedented anti-Semitic and anti-labor propaganda, the storm-troop followers of Father Coughlin, America&#8217;s Number One Fascist, are organizing a &#8220;mass demonstration and parade&#8221; to form at Columbus Circle on Saturday, August 19th, at 6 P.M. and March into Union Square.</p>

<p>The Fascists, in their circular, call their provocation a &#8220;manifestation of Christianity.&#8221; That is not true. The Fascist parade is simply a mobilization of strike-breakers, thugs, Jew-haters and union-busters.</p>

<p>This provocation was forecast by Coughlin two weeks ago in a nation-wide broadcast entitled &#8220;The Call To Action,&#8221; in which he attacked the &#8220;Bolshevik&#8221; leaders of the American Trade Union Movement, the &#8220;non-religious Jews,&#8221; and stated that he would resort to the use of &#8220;force.&#8221; &#8220;I will meet you in Franco&#8217;s way!&#8221; he declared. Father Coughlin is organizing a Fascist movement in America, with the same methods and the same aims as Mussolini and Hitler.</p>

<p>The Fascist demonstration of August 19th is an open challenge to the whole Labor Movement, as well as to the whole anti-Fascist movement of this city.</p>

<p>We cannot afford to wait until Coughlin converts the United States into one huge concentration camp.</p>

<p>Time is pressing! Let us join hands now against this terrible menace to our liberties, our rights, our very lives!</p>

<p>Let us all join hands to stop Fascism in America!</p>

<p>We call upon you to join with us and rally in Union Square on Saturday, August 19th, at 4:30 P.M. to protest against this Fascist provocation.</p>
