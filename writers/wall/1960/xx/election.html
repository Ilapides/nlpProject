<p class="fst">Dear elector,</p>

<p class="fst">I am very pleased that the Fazakerley Ward Labour Party have given me the opportunity to contest this ward again.</p>

<p>In spite of a possible overdose of politics during the past twelve months, I feel there are many question which most urgently require attention and which should ensure the usual high poll in Fazakerley ward.</p>

<p>Much of this election special is quite rightly devoted to the serious situation facing this and other local authorities because of the neglect of local government by the Conservatives at Westminster and their vicious financial policy. The removal of the cheap loan policy we enjoyed under the Labour Government, coupled with the absurdly high ratio of interest which the City is forced to pay, on money loaned for the building of houses and schools, means that the big financial interests are enabled to make huge profits at the expense of the ratepayer and the corporation tenants.</p>

<p>Anybody who has lived in this city for any length of time cannot fail to be impressed by the improvements made in the last few years, since the Labour Party gained control. I ask for your support to ensure we can continue the job of re-building this City in a manner worthy of its citizens and free from the slums, dreariness and prejudices of the past.</p>

<p>Assuring you that if elected I will be only too anxious to assist any and every elector who should need my assistance.</p>
