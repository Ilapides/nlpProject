<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;402, 21 April 1978, p.&nbsp;15.<br />
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">The Bradford Trades Council stands opposed to the acceptance of
any redundancies in the Bradford District. All three of the major
sources of employment are now in decline. The wool industry has
suffered a long period of contraction, the Tory controlled District
Council has run down the labour force by a policy of demanning and
now the sharpest decline is in manufacturing, the supposed salvation
for this declining area.</p>

<p>If we allow the closure of Thorns and other threatened
redundancies to take place, one third of engineering jobs in Bradford
will have been lost in the short space of twelve months. Bradford, at
the mid-point of the M62, could soon become an industrial desert, a
process already far advanced on Humberside and Merseyside at either
end of the motorway.</p>

<p>The first priority is to stand firm against the threatened
closures and redundancies and to mobilise the whole labour movement
to this end. The movement also needs to work out a fighting programme
to deal with this whole question of unemployment. At the April
meeting this Thursday, and probably at a special labour movement
conference in a few weeks time, the Bradford Trades Council will seek
to give such a lead.</p>
