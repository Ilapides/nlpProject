The latest <strong>l&#8217;Humanit&#233;</strong> to hand indicates that even the slogan of a &#8220;<em>Front Populaire</em> Government&#8221; has been foresaken. It is now a simple &#8220;government of the left&#8221; which the Stalinists demand. And what would this government of the &#8220;left&#8221; be? A government, writes Jacques Duclos, &#8220;which would give life to the resolutions of Wagram.&#8221; (<strong>l&#8217;Humanit&#233;</strong>, Nov. 12) In other words, the resolutions of the Radical Socialist Party congress which ended on the keynote appeal for &#8220;impassioned devotion to national defense&#8221;! !</p><p>Such a government, which will apply, says Duclos, &#8220;a left policy,&#8221; i.e., dissolution of the Fascist leagues &#8211; and passionate national defense? &#8211; <em>&#8220;will meet no difficulties from the Communists.&#8221;</em></p><p>No, hardly. Valliant Couturier, who marched on November 11 with uniformed, bemedalled war veterans, rhapsodically reported in the columns of <strong>l&#8217;Humanit&#233;</strong> that as they marched by, the unanimous electric cry was: &#8220;Long live the republican army! Long live the Republic!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;The Unknown Soldier has once more found his comrades&#8221; &#8211; is the headline over the Armistice Day spread in <strong>l&#8217;Humanit&#233;</strong>. Tragically, it is true. The Cachins who handed over millions to unknown graves in 1914&#8211;18 are today preparing to hand the new generation over to the same fate symbolized by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris with the slab of cold marble beneath it.</p><p class="linkback">&#160;<br /><big><a href="#top"><strong>Top of page</strong></a></big></p><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" /><p class="linkback"><a href="../../index.html">Main NI Index</a> | <a href="../../../index.html">Main Newspaper Index</a><br /><br /><a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/index.htm">Encyclopedia of Trotskyism</a> | <a href="https://www.marxists.org/index.htm">Marxists&#8217; Internet Archive</a></p><p class="updat">Last updated on 4 February 2018</p></body>
