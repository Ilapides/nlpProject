<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%">
<p class="fst">To the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:</p>


<p class="fst">THE two-year period of my extra-organizational
collaboration with the Chinese Communist party has come to an end and
the <strong>China Forum</strong> which I founded and edited during
that time has been forced to suspend publication. In the interest of
our whole movement as well as in my personal interest, I consider it
necessary to record here and publish the history of the <strong>China
Forum</strong> and the circumstances of its suspension ...</p>


<hr class="section" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p class="fst">From almost the very beginning of my active work &#8211; which
I date from the time I began reporting events in China in a communist
way &#8211; a number of questions presented themselves to me in increasingly
forcible form. These arose originally from my discovery of the gross
distortions and exaggerations which I found to be characteristic of
communist propaganda in China and abroad. I define propaganda as the
skillful, clear, accurate and wholly truthful reporting of the facts
linked to an incisive, purposive interpretation and a plan of action
for dealing with the facts in a revolutionary way. I learned this from
the life and work of Lenin and his Bolshevik comrades who taught us
that the truth comes from the masses themselves and that only disaster
can result front telling them lies. I have never learned to the
contrary that it was my revolutionary duty to work in any other way,
although I soon found that the present-day Communist party press makes
a practise of distinguishing between propaganda and truth.</p>



<p>Examples of exaggeration and distortion most striking to me were
naturally those which applied to China, because here I could check
allegations with known facts. I first wrote these down to the ignorance
or incapacity of individuals. I felt that communist editors abroad
would publish accurate facts about China if they could get them.
Accordingly with a friend I tried to set up an independent mail news
service and sent weekly bulletins to papers all over the world giving
brief, sharp, factual accounts of what was going on. This was in the
fall of 1931 after my return from the area of the great Central China
floods of that summer. I scarcely understood then why this service
failed to secure any response from the communist press abroad. After
about three months I had to suspend it for lack of support. It simply
didn&#8217;t get published except in a few organs which were not official
Communist party papers, including the New York <strong>Militant</strong>.</p>


<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before I began to perceive, with a deeper study of
international events and the history of the Chinese revolution, that a
consistent thread ran through the distortions and exaggerations which I
found not only in brief casual reports of current events but in the
solemn pronunciamentoes made by delegates before plenums of the ECCI. I
discovered that these departures from the truth were made necessary by
the official premise that ever since the catastrophe of 1927 a mighty,
upsurging revolutionary movement has been marching forward in China to
the very brink of seizure of power under the leadership of the Chinese
Communist party. I discovered that these exaggerations were necessary
because the premise was false and along with it all the basic tenets of
the policies being pursued by the Communist International and the
Communist party in China. I cannot begin here to give a summary of some
of these distortions (which I verbally cited to you by the dozen),
ranging from particular incidents (the wilfully false picture given of
the cotton mill strike in Shanghai in January 1932, even to the point
of transposing it to February to heighten the impression given of the
workers&#8217; role in the Shanghai war) to high-flown generalizations like
the statement recently made before the plenum of the ECCI that the CCP
has &#8220;won over the majority of the Chinese working class and the
peasantry&#8221; ...</p>


<p>In denying the presence of a mighty revolutionary upsurge (i.e., a
vast organized march toward the seizure of power), I respect facts made
still clearer perhaps when compared to the facts and figures of the
monster mass movements of the 1926-27 period. The tragic errors of the
communist leadership in 1927 were primarily responsible for the
decapitation of that great movement and because no lessons have been
drawn from these events to this very day, these errors, monstrously
accumulated, are still responsible for the tragedies of today. But for
the purposes of our comparison here, let us take for example the single
fact that in 1926 in Greater Shanghai there were 267 strikes. In 1932
there were 82. Let us remember that on the eve of the workers&#8217; seizure
of power in Shanghai in March, 1927, there were more than 800,000
workers, handicraftsmen and petty traders out on the streets fighting
with arms in hands for demands of a far-reaching political character. A
close check <em>for the entire country</em> in the latter half of 1933
showed me that less than one-thirtieth of that number were engaged in
strikes and other disputes during any given month and that almost
invariably the demands were defensive demands against wage cuts and
lockouts. Moreover, the lack of cohesive leadership &#8211; often in
departments of the same factory or in one or more of a group of
factories &#8211; or even sometimes lack of even the most elementary
organization &#8211; has in almost every case led to deadening failure and
relatively easy betrayal by the yellow &#8220;labor leaders&#8221; and &#8220;mediators&#8221;

of the Kuo Min Tang. In 1925 the shooting of thirteen students by
British police in Shanghai was the touch-off for a general strike which
paralyzed the city and which was seconded by vast sympathy strikes
which broke like a series of tidal waves over the entire country. In
January 1932, when the Japanese imperialists used the Shanghai
International Settlement as a base for operations which cost the lives
of tens of thousands of Chinese, not a single strike interrupted the
normal course of the public or other services in that settlement. In
the factories there were no strikes but a large scale lockout to which
the overwhelming majority of Shanghai&#8217;s workers submitted without
protest. ...</p>


<p>In the case of the widespread but isolated and individual cases of
peasant uprisings, and this includes the Red armies in Kiangsi, these
struggles await the leadership of a strong working class movement
before they can have a successful issue. The Red armies in their
restricted and surrounded areas and with their meagre resources have
fought heroically against the Kuo Min Tang attacks upon them. But until
the Kuo Min Tang is shaken from its bulwarks in the
imperialist-controlled working class centers, their prospect of
revolutionary triumph remains necessarily dim. No revolutionary purpose
is served by taking refuge in the fiction that these armies have
proletarian leadership because individual workers, undoubtedly leaders
of superior quality and courage, have been torn from their factories
and from their fellow workers and sent down to occupy key positions in
the Red army districts and in the Red armies themselves. Indeed, this
common practise of extracting the most conscious and progressive
working class elements from their working class environment and sending
them down to the Red districts is a good index to the criminal
transposition of emphasis which has helped paralyze the working class
movement in the cities. If the White Terror doesn&#8217;t carry off the
workers&#8217; leaders as they arise, the CP does and has done so in hundreds
of cases. This helps in no small part to explain why it has also been
impossible to mobilize a genuine mass anti-Japanese movement in the
face of military aggression and why the White Terror of the Kuo Min
Tang has succeeded, by filling mass graves and innumerable prisons with
the martyred dead and living, in downing the anti-imperialist movement
or efforts toward the organization of such a movement and paving the
way for the ever-increasing encroachments of the imperialists. The
party has not yet gripped and directed the deep and bitter and often
inarticulate hatred of the masses of the people for their oppressors
and this includes large sections of the lower petty bourgeoisie who
could be won by successful mass pressure from below. This is because
the party has failed to translate the realities of everyday events into
its program and tactics ...</p>


<hr class="section" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p class="fst">But precisely because at all costs I desired to carry on
the <strong>Forum</strong>&#8217;s open struggle against the common enemy &#8211;
against the Kuo Min Tang and the imperialists &#8211; I sedulously avoided
bringing these issues into the columns of the paper, increasingly
against my better judgment. I leaned over far backward in this respect.
This expressed itself in many of the current issues with which we had
to deal.</p>



<p>I ask you to recall the whole uphill fight which the <strong>Forum</strong>
waged on behalf of Paul and Gertrud Ruegg in the spring and summer of
1932 during which time I repeatedly warned against the emphasis which
was being placed on the &#8220;legal&#8221; aspects of the case and the
&#8220;negotiations&#8221; with the Kuo Min Tang to the detriment of mass pressure
and the capitalization of the case for political purposes. You paid lip
service to the need for mass pressure &#8211; particularly here in China &#8211;
but in fact the &#8220;legalities&#8221; and futile negotiations remained the major
pillars of the defense. Until in the very end I finally rebelled, I
wasn&#8217;t even permitted to give Ruegg his honorable and rightful title &#8211;

secretary of the Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat! Yet although I
felt the struggle for the Rueggs was being seriously handicapped by the
tactics being pursued, I carried on the fight with all the energy at my
command and you will recall that it was I who created the local defense
committee and was chiefly responsible for the widespread press
propaganda campaign and the considerable sympathy which we aroused. Yet
the strictly non-political attitude which Ruegg was forced to assume at
the trial (in contrast to the highly political attitude of his
prosecutors!) was in my opinion one of the major reasons for the fate
to which he and his wife were condemned.</p>


<p>I ask you to recall the whole period of the organization and
activities of the China League for Civil Rights, from December 1932 to
June 1933, in which I took an active part. I gave full play to this
hybrid League and its work without once publishing the basic criticisms
which I often voiced to you and which in the end were wholly confirmed
by what happened after the Kuo Min Tang murdered Yang Chien in June
that year. I ask you to recall the views I set forth in August and
September 1933, on the subject of the <em>Anti-War Congress</em> which
at your specific request I did not publish. Instead, to my regret, I
published the foul rot of Marley &amp; Co. without freely giving play
to the true facts about that farcical junket which had convinced me
that the policies which gave it birth do not one single whit advance
the international struggle against imperialist war.</p>


<p>On one occasion &#8211; and this at least I can take comfort in &#8211; I
passively resisted when you requested me to write and publish a
slanderous attack on Chen Du Hsiu when he was condemned to 13 years
imprisonment by the Kuo Min Tang. Your request was specific. I was not
to deal with the issues which had brought Chen Du Hsiu from being the
leader of the CP in 1927 to being leader of the Chinese Opposition in
1933. I was only to string together a vile series of labels in an
effort to explain why the Kuo Min Tang <em>even</em> imprisoned the
leader of the Left Opposition. As you know, that attack was never
written or published.</p>



<p>Again in December 1933, upon my return from Fukien, you specifically
demanded that I set aside the results of my own personal investigations
in Foochow in order to write on your behalf (but over my signature!) an
utterly baseless and slanderous attack on the Left Opposition. You will
recall that you charged at that time that the &#8220;Trotskyists&#8221; were
prominently identified with the new government set up in Fukien by Chen
Ming-shu and Tsai Ting-kai. You lumped the Left Opposition with the
Third Party and the so-called Social Democrats among the petty
bourgeois satellites of the Fukien militarists. It was as much to
satisfy myself on this very point as to perform a mission for you, that
I went down to Foochow and spent two weeks there and learned through
direct contact with dozens of people prominently concerned that the
Left Opposition was stoutly and clearly opposed to the Foochow regime.
I haven&#8217;t place here to discuss the relations of the CP to the
short-lived Fukien government or the character of the &#8220;negotiations&#8221;
which were going on down there. The important thing here is that on my
return you demanded that I write slanders which flew in the face of
everything I myself had learned. It is interesting, as a sidelight on
your methods in factional strife as you conceive it, that your
representative in Foochow sent back a report, through me, ironically
enough, that one of the most prominent of the youthful pseudo-radicals
in Foochow, Wu Cui-yuen to be exact, was a leading &#8220;Trotskyist&#8221;. It so
happened that I had met and had several lengthy interviews with Wu and
by the time I left Foochow I understood his position and his
personality exceedingly well. He was as much a Trotskyist as Mei
Lan-fang is! Yet you actually demanded that I ignore my own knowledge
of the man and in my article on Fukien set him down as a &#8220;Trotskyist&#8221;.
I was faced on the one hand by your demands that I write falsehoods to
suit your policies and on the other by my deep desire to set forth the
actual facts about the Opposition&#8217;s attitude toward the Fukien regime.
But once more, to preserve the shreds of our relationship, I drove a
middle course and did neither, leaving the whole question out of my
article ...</p>


<hr class="section" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p class="fst">Nevertheless, abruptly in January of this year you
forced an ultimatum upon me and subsequently forced the break in our
relationship because I could not and would not, at your demand, devote
the <strong>China Forum</strong> to policies which I could not and do
not believe compatible with the interests of the Chinese revolution and
the international proletarian revolution. I could not, at your demand,
set aside the convictions to which I had literally been driven by the
stinging lash of catastrophic events in China, Germany and the world
over. Particularly my deep interest in Chinese events during the last
three years made it impossible for me, finally, to give active support
to policies and tactics whose disastrous effects were being a
thousandfold confirmed for me by the tragic events of every
swiftly-passing day. I could not ignore questions which strike at the
roots of our work and the whole structure of our hopes for a
revolutionary future.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that these questions are rocking the entire
International today, you denied my right to raise them in print. You
demanded more. You demanded that I attack anybody who did so &#8211;
primarily the people you call &#8220;counter-revolutionary Trotskyists&#8221; &#8211; the
only people who are facing these problems today in a fearless,
revolutionary way! You demanded that the <strong>China Forum</strong>
become a stereotype for the policies and vulgar factional slanders
which I could neither then nor now be party to. In reply to my
questions on China you simply quoted back at me the lies and half-lies
I&#8217;ve been so used to reading in <strong>Inprecorr</strong>. You even
declared: &#8220;For propaganda purposes a certain amount of exaggeration is
necessary ...&#8221; and went on amazingly to say: &#8220;but we know the true
facts, and we base our policies on them, not on these exaggerations!&#8221; A
new slant on modern-day CI tactics! Facts, you say, are
curious things. They have to be turned around and around and around,
and examined closely until their true nature becomes apparent. The
trouble is you turn them so far and so quickly that they turn into
something like a dizzily turning top of fancy &#8211; or at best
wish-fulfilling misrepresentations.</p>



<p>To my questions on Germany you quoted Heckert, Piatnitsky and the
ECCI&#8217;s famous resolution declaring that the collapse of the German
party and the slaughter of the German workers were based on the past,
present and future correct policies of the CPG! You declared I had no
right to offer critical comment on the dangerously opportunistic
foreign and domestic policies of the USSR, most notably on the entry of
the USSR on a straight nationalist basis into the disgusting corridors
of imperialist intrigue. To the contrary, I was lovingly, fawningly to
fondle and hail the policies which have meant disaster in China,
Germany and elsewhere and are rapidly leading the USSR into the vacuum
of nationalist isolation from the world-wide proletarian movement. This
I was to do, to begin with, by publishing Stalin&#8217;s face on the front
page and columns of the customary penegyrics to his infallibility.
Above all and before all, I was to take up cudgels against
&#8220;counter-revolutionary Trotskyism&#8221;. That was to be the main point of my
reformation &#8211; to raise no questions myself and slander anybody else who
did so.</p>


<p>In reply to your demand that I submit to an editorial board in order
that these editorial policies should be effectively put into practise,
I offered</p>


<ol>
  <li>to continue publication strictly as before, meanwhile arguing out
my differences with you in discussions on the side;</li>
  <li>to throw the columns of the <strong>Forum</strong> open to a
general discussion of all basic revolutionary questions, with free play
to unorthodox as well as orthodox views. If your views were correct, I
argued, it would be a distinct advantage to you to have such an
opportunity to display their brilliance alongside the puny efforts of
your critics;</li>

  <li>to publish orthodox news and views but to reserve for myself the
right to comment and criticize.</li>
</ol>
<p class="fst">These repeated offers you repeatedly refused. You
offered to discuss these questions with me verbally <em>if</em> in the
meanwhile I threw the <strong>Forum</strong> open to your editorial
board. My other proposals were unthinkable! Give the <strong>Forum</strong>&#8217;s
readers a chance to hear &#8220;counter-revolutionary&#8221; viewpoints? Never that! I
could only display my revolutionary purity by acceding to your demands.
We would talk things over until spring, when if all went well (i.e., if
I showed a satisfactory adaptation to your viewpoint) I could pack up
for an educational trip to the Soviet Union where I would certainly
become convinced of the error of my ways. In other words, you wanted my
signature on a promissory note with the amount left blank for you to
fill in. You put this in the form of an ultimatum and you told me that
if I did anything but accept I would forthwith enter the camp of the

&#8220;counter-revolution&#8221;.</p>


<p>I had to refuse these terms. I had to refuse to lend myself to a
slanderous and baseless struggle against the International Left
Opposition. I had to refuse to lend space to the nauseatingly fawning
praise of Stalin and uncritical reception of Stalinist policies which
characterize the Communist party press the world over. I had to refuse
to take shelter in the cold and draughty empty spaces which stretch
behind the impressive fa&ccedil;ade and early traditions of the
Communist International. I would like to go to the Soviet Union for a
visit one day &#8211; but I had to refuse your offer on your terms. I had to
refuse, in short, to become a hack prostitute in the name of the
revolution.</p>


<p>In the end, too, I had to refuse to turn over to you the printing
plant I had built up with so much pain and struggle because I
considered it not your property but the property of the working class
movement. Because I could not carry on the <strong>Forum</strong>
myself, for lack of financial resources and because of heavy debts
contracted, I disposed of the plant and turned every farthing of the
proceeds over to where I now consider the true interests of our
movement lie. It was with a deep and abiding bitterness that I had to
see the <strong>Forum</strong> go down under the blows of those whom I
had considered comrades, when for two years it had fought off all its
many enemies on the outside.</p>


<p>Yet with it came the
realization that we have to build anew over the ruins you have wrought.
The revolution and the building of our future moves forward and when we
trample down the defenses; of our enemies we shall crush underfoot
everything and everybody that stands in our way. No sycophantic, blind
allegiance to a name, an empty fa&ccedil;ade, a torn and shredded
prestige can lead us forward. Only unswerving fidelity to our goal and
active struggle toward this end with the weapons of a correct and
tested political line will lift us from defeat to ultimate victory. To
this struggle I shall continue to dedicate all my energies.</p>
