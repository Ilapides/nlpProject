<p class="fst">During the first month of the new year the crisis in Japanese-American relations will enter an acute phase. The trade treaty of
1911 denounced by President Roosevelt six months ago will expire on
Jan. 26. The negotiations for replacing it involve not merely trade
questions but the broader and graver issues of Japan&rsquo;s position
in East Asia, its relations with the Soviet Union, and its role in
the war.</p>

<p><em>Under the pressure of open threats of an embargo, supplemented
by ostentatious additions to U.S. naval and air strength in the Far
East, Japan has made a token gesture of conciliation. It has promised
to re-open to American and other foreign shipping the lower Yangtze
River, which it closed after conquering Shanghai and Nanking two
years ago.</em></p>

<p>Japanese spokesmen represented this step as a major concession on
Japan&rsquo;s part and seemed to look for some immediate softening of
the American attitude, which has grown extremely tough during the
last two months.</p>

<p><em>In this they are doomed to disappointment. They will have to
come across with much more before a Washington-Tokyo deal can be
consummated.</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the counterfoil to its dickering with the U.S.,
Japan continues its negotiations with the Soviet Union and in Japan
itself a fairly broad division appears to have takten place in the
ruling circles along the lines of a Russian orientation on the one
side, and an American orientation on the other.</p>

<p><em>That the Japanese leaned far more definitely on the Russian
side BEFORE Stalin&rsquo;s invasion of Finland, and began showing
signs of conciliation toward U.S. imperialism AFTER the invasion is
an extremely significant fact. Even if sheer weight of numbers should
bring belated Soviet victories in Finland, the Japanese militarists
along with hawk-eyed observers throughout the world, have had a
chance to observe the much-vaunted Red Army machine in action.</em></p>

<p>It was what they learned that lay back of the unusually swift and
stiff retaliatory action against the U.S.S.R. taken by England and
France through the League and by this country. It also must be
playing no small part in the decisions now being made in Japan&rsquo;s
inner councils concerning that country&rsquo;s course during the
coming fateful months.</p>

<p><em>For in 1940 all those nations not yet directly involved in
hostilities are destined to be forced to move one way or another.
Many countries whose &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; is only a thin mask for
actual participation &ndash; like the U.S. &ndash; will take steps
toward more decisive intervention in the conflict.</em></p>

<p>What Chamberlain told the House of Commons a few weeks ago still
remains the salient fact of the war: the final lineups are not yet
decided and those now warring do not yet know or are not yet sure who
will turn out to be friends and who foes when the showdown comes.
They will be lots surer, it is safe to say, long before 1940 in its
turn joins the present outgoing year in dark record of this epoch of
capitalist decline and disintegration.</p>
