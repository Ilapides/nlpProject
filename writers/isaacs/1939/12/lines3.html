<p class="fst">Roosevelt showed a little more of his hand in the diplomatic poker
game at Tokio this week. He has in effect informed Tokio that any
improvement in Soviet- Japanese relations, e.g., conclusion of a
non-aggression pact, would imperil the &ldquo;friendly&rdquo;
relations between Washington and Tokio.</p>

<p>One aspect of this American intervention in the Soviet-Japanese
negotiations was officially confirmed.</p>

<p><em>Eugene Dooman, the counselor of the U.S. Embassy, asked the
chief of the American Bureau of the Tokio Foreign Office, Seijiro
Yosliizava, whether Japan intended to negotiate a non-aggression pact
with Russia.</em> Yoshzava replied evasively that such a pact was &ldquo;not
at present on the Japanese program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In connection with this incident, the Foreign Office let it be
known through newspaper channels that a few days earlier, on Dec.&nbsp;4,
Joseph Clark Grew, the U.S. Ambassador, had bluntly informed Japan&rsquo;s
foreign minister that Japanese-American and Japanese-Soviet
&ldquo;friendship&rdquo; were mutually exclusive, or, as the Japanese
newspapers put it, that &ldquo;Japanese-American friendship could not
be replaced by Japanese-Soviet friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>It becomes clear that Washington has now definitely informed
the Japanese that they have to choose between playing the American
game against Russia or facing American naval might in the Pacific.
For Japanese &ldquo;cooperation&rdquo; in a war against the Soviet
Union, the Americans are apparently ready to pay a fairly still price
at China&rsquo;s expense, to recognize Japan&rsquo;s &ldquo;special
position&rdquo; in East Asia.</em></p>

<p>During the last two months the Japanese government has been
divided on which course to follow &ndash; with Russia and Germany
against Britain and the U.S.A., or with the latter against Russia.
Powerful elements among the militarists have favored the former
policy, as giving the army a powerful lever in dislodging Britain
from its entrenched positions in China.</p>

<p>The orientation toward Russia has already moved quite far. As we
know, the truce ending the border warfare in the Far East was signed
the day before Russia invaded Poland. Since then negotiations have
been continuing for a broader accord and last Friday a border
demarcation commission met at Chita, in Far Eastern Siberia.</p>

<p><em>However, the Russian invasion of Finland has introduced a fresh
factor in the situation. For the first time the Japanese militarists
as provided with an opportunity to see the Red Army in action on a
scale larger than the Japanese ever dared provoke in the Far Eastern
border fighting. Military men all over the world are narrowly
watching the Russian military performance in Finland, but none more
attentively than the Japanese.</em></p>

<p>And the Russians are not exactly giving an impressive
demonstration of their military effectiveness. Instead the world is
getting a glimpse of the extent to which the purges and the
dislocation of Soviet economy has affected its military strength.</p>
