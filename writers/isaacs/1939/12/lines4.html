<p class="fst">All year long We are fed pap from the pulpits and the press, on
the screen and over the air waves. But it takes Christmas to place
all this sham in its proper setting of sharply chiselled contrasts.</p>

<p><em>All the preachers and all the preachers&rsquo; men bleat about
peace and goodwill. But the gossamer web of their phrases fails to
cover a single gaping wound in the bodies of men rent apart on the
battlefields. It fails to cover the shaking frames of the cold and
starving millions.</em></p>

<p>Every day of every year men, women, and children are nailed to the
cross of war and greed and privation. And on this under the pathetic
figure of one such crucified man the preachers try to tell us again
that this is all in the order of things, that this is part of the
divinely ordained beauty and mystery of life, that after the cup of
pain shall come the soothing draft of salvation in a world better
than man can build.</p>

<p><em>And with that we&rsquo;re supposed to pull in our belts and go
back to another 364 days of dying, killing, starving &ndash;
whichever our masters decree we shall do.</em></p>

<p><em>The capitalist system that still rules the world offers in the
reality of things bloody war and mass starvation, dressing it up with
tinsel, rouging the lips of a death&rsquo;s head. You can&rsquo;t
deal with carriers of deadly disease unless you drain out the swamps
where they breed, and you can&rsquo;t do away with war and want
unless you put an end to the capitalist order of things.</em></p>

<p>The same people, the same newspapers, politicians, preachers,
writers, radio commentators, who fill the Christmas air with their
dripping phrases about peace on earth are preparing to sweep the
working men and women of this country into the holocaust of war.</p>

<p>But if we are to take the idea of peace on earth seriously, we&rsquo;ve
got to work with might and main to prevent them from doing so, and
we&rsquo;ll do this by thrusting them from the seats of power and
setting out to build a new kind of world.</p>
