<p class="fst">THE SCOTTISH Trades Union Congress (STUC) held its annual conference in Aberdeen last week. One of the highlights of the conference was when delegates voted to support the Chhokar family campaign.</p>

<p>The congress came alive during powerful speeches by Aamer Anwar and Mr Chhokar, the father of Surjit Singh Chhokar who was murdered two years ago. Many delegates were visibly moved by the account of the treatment the family has received at the hands of the Scottish justice system. The congress passed a number of other good resolutions, including those supporting asylum seekers and the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>However, during the emergency debate on the threatened closure of Motorola and Compaq union leaders gave little more than hand-wringing gestures. Throughout congress it was obvious there were tensions between STUC leaders and the Labour-dominated Scottish Executive.</p>

<p>A fringe meeting held by the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) attracted nearly 40 people, the majority of them delegates, to hear Tommy Sheridan.</p>
