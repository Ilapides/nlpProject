<p class="fst">Gordon Brown&rsquo;s plans to make migrants &ldquo;earn&rdquo; their right to British citizenship are not only hypocritical and racist to the core &ndash; they threaten all working people, whether they were born in Britain or not.</p>

<p>Immigration minister Liam Byrne claims consultations show British people want newcomers to &ldquo;pay their taxes like the rest of us&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Why then did the government retreat in the face of business pressure from making millionaire &ldquo;non-doms&rdquo; do precisely that?</p>

<p>Why do they resist any attempt to make the rich pay their way?</p>

<p>Migrants who are likely to make more use of public services will be made to pay more to apply for citizenship.</p>

<p>However, those likely to make less use of them &ndash; the majority, since they tend to be young and healthy &ndash; will not have their contributions reduced. And why stop at migrants? If level of public service use is to be used as a criteria for setting fees, then why not use it to determine contributions from people already living in Britain?</p>

<p>If migrants have to demonstrate their willingness to &ldquo;integrate&rdquo; by working or doing voluntary work, how long before the long-term unemployed are treated in the same way?</p>

<p>Byrne says his consultations show that Britain is not &ldquo;a nation of Alf Garnetts&rdquo;, but this is exactly what the government thinks of us.</p>

<p>First we have a racist and xenophobic media playing on people&rsquo;s ignorance and despair to create a storm of hatred and suspicion.</p>

<p>Then the government finds it convenient to &ldquo;listen&rdquo; to the people on this issue, in a way it never did over, say, the war in Iraq or the renationalisation of the railways.</p>

<p>We can best answer this by defending the rights of migrants and by supporting, not non-existent &ldquo;British&rdquo; values, but the international values of solidarity and anti-racism.</p>
