<strong>A Fate Worse Than Debt</strong><br/>
<em>Penguin, &#163;4.50, 1988.</em></p>

<p class="fst">The &#8216;Third World&#8217; debt crisis is arguably capitalism&#8217;s most
crushing indictment. Rapacious international bankers ever hungry for
higher profits, with the often tacit approval of their governments,
have poured loan after loan into the countries of the ex-colonial
world quite aware that they can never be repaid. For them debt only
becomes dangerous when it cannot be serviced; the longer the debt
remains unpaid the longer they receive payment, in the form of
interest, for the use of their money. For every 1% rise in interest
rates there is a further $2bn&#8211;$6bn due in debt service &#8211; it is a
tidy profit. From 1982, the year regarded as the point when debt went
from being a problem to a crisis, until 1985, profits recorded by the
US&#8217;s top banks rose from 38% to 84%. The value of their shares rose
respectively from between 83% and 154%.</p>

<p>The risks involved in such ventures were offset by the power of
the Federal government and the resources of the US Treasury who have
gone to extraordinary lengths to preserve the solvency of US banking.
But the generosity has not extended beyond the barracudas in the
banking pool; the flip side of the coin reveals a rash of small
banking failures and regional bank bankruptcies across the length and
breadth of the USA.</p>

<p>The real consequences of the debt crisis are shouldered day and
night by the men, women and children of the filthy, infested shanty
towns and villages that are the feature and result of so-called
&#8216;development&#8217;. For workers and peasants in the grip of the IMF
austerity programmes crushing poverty is sometimes relieved only by death.</p>

<p><strong>A Fate Worse Than Debt</strong> is a useful and highly informative
introduction. Susan George outlines the background to the crisis and
the role of organisations like the IMF and the World Bank. She
reveals the sometimes horrifying statistics that chart the
consequences of debt and austerity in the borrowing countries.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons for the artificial length of the present
&#8216;boom&#8217; has been the super exploitation of the ex-colonial world
by the advanced capitalist countries. Worsening terms of trade led to
a net inflow of capital to the developed capitalist world of $65bn in
1985. Debt ballooned to over $1 trillion or $1,000bn. Another feature
of the debt crisis has been the outright robbery and mismanagement of
loans by corrupt governments. At least 15% of the Philippines debt of
$26bn was appropriated by the Marcos family. Some may have been used
on Imelda&#8217;s staggering collections of shoes and knickers. But even
more went on projects like the Morong nuclear power plant which was
commissioned from Westinghouse for $2.1bn in 1976. The debt servicing
on this project was costing $500,000 a day by 1987. Although the
reactor is ready to function, fortunately it does not: it was built
in the middle of the Pacific &#8216;fire rim&#8217; earthquake zone at the
foot of a volcano!</p>

<p>Failure to comply with the IMF&#8217;s &#8216;adjustment&#8217; programmes to
pay for debt means the loss of credit worthiness. Threat of default
on payments is met by a counter threat of seizure of a nation&#8217;s
assets on land, sea or air. As one US Treasury official coldly put
it: &#8220;Have you ever contemplated what would happen to the health of
a country if the government could not get insulin for its diabetics?&#8221;</p>

<p>One study recently quantified the relationship between debt and
mortality: for every additional $10 a year in per capita interest
payments there was 0.39 a year less in life expectancy improvement
for the people involved. In the 73 countries studied in the 1970s
each person had forgone 387 days of life, i.e. lost a year of life.
In Peru infant mortality is estimated at 80 per 1,000 births. In the
worst of the shanty towns half of new born babies die before they are
one year old. This slaughter is the incalculable cost of world debt.
And what is the reaction of those who preside over this? Oscar
Trelles, ex-President of the Peruvian Senate commented in 1981:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is healthier to eat less; thin women are more
attractive than fat ones, and just because Jewish children had hunger
in the Nazi concentration camps, it did not make them more stupid&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">Driven by despair, deprivation and hunger children are forced to
beg and steal. Many sell themselves into prostitution. What they face
is not life but an unending, death defying and heroic struggle to
stay alive.</p>

<p>At the end of her book, Susan George considers what to do. &#8220;The
debt crisis is a symptom &#8211; one among many &#8211; of an increasingly
polarised world, organised for the benefit of a minority that will
stop at nothing to maintain and strengthen its control and
privilege&#8221;. Absolutely correct! Unfortunately, however, the
author&#8217;s own solution, what she calls the &#8216;Third Solution&#8217; &#8211;
debt, development and democracy &#8211; relies on this minority
effectively giving up its control and privilege voluntarily for the
good of the poor!</p>

<p>It amounts to this &#8211; the developing country would pay its
interest payments into a &#8216;National Development Fund&#8217;,
democratically controlled by a &#8216;broad-based development fund
management&#8217;. This fund would finance various projects for the
community. For every payment into this Fund the donor banks and lMF
would correspondingly write off their debt repayments!</p>

<p>How can Susan George believe in this remedy when she quotes
earlier the views of a Citicorp banker that &#8220;our strategy is not
one of making loans but of making money&#8221;? Her dilemma is that,
while advocating a solution within the confines of the present
economic order, she marvellously exposes its constraints.
Nevertheless her book puts a devastating case for change in terms of
wasted resources and the potential that could be used if the world
economy was planned and democratically controlled by and for the
working class.</p>
