<p class="info">From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/feb/08/joe-owens-obituary" target="new"><strong>The Guardian</strong></a>, 8 February 2010.<br/>
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />

<br />
<p class="fst">At the age of 19, as a miner at Polkemmet colliery, in West
Lothian, Joe Owens was thrown into the year-long miners&#8217; strike.
Joe, who has died unexpectedly aged 44, emerged as a powerful leader,
the youngest NUM pit delegate ever elected in Scotland, and was
recognised as a great speaker.</p>

<p>The strike was the defining experience in Joe&#8217;s life. On its
10th anniversary, his book of interviews with miners and their wives,
<strong>Miners 1984&#8211;1994: A Decade of Endurance</strong>, was published. His
introduction is exemplary, revealing Joe&#8217;s wide reading (he loved
poetry, particularly Bertolt Brecht and Pablo Neruda), astute
political sense and wonderful command of language. On the 25th
anniversary, Joe returned to the strike in his contribution to the
edited volume <strong>Shafted: The Media, the Miners&#8217; Strike and the
Aftermath</strong>, in which he wrote how the strike &#8220;coloured and will,
in all its brightness, shades and shadows, influence me until I pass&#8221;.</p>

<p>Joe was born in Blackburn, West Lothian, with three younger
brothers and two sisters, and attended St Kentigern&#8217;s school,
Blackburn. When Polkemmet colliery closed in 1985, Joe moved to the
Bilston Glen mine and, when he lost his job there, he went to Napier
University in Edinburgh to study journalism. In 1988 he was given an
opportunity on the local <strong>Wester Hailes Sentinel</strong>.</p>

<p>I first met Joe in 1993 when he was the editor of <strong>The
Northender</strong>, a community paper in Springburn/Possilpark, a tough
area of Glasgow, where he had established a campaigning publication
holding local politicians to account and challenging the drug dealers
in that part of the city.</p>

<p>Joe worked on a wide range of papers as a casual sub-editor before
securing a contract with the <strong>Daily Record</strong> in Glasgow. He also
became active with the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) and served
as chair of both Glasgow branch and the Scottish council. An
unexpected change for Joe happened when he met Breda Joy, a delegate
from Kerry, at an NUJ annual conference. He went over to live with
Breda in Ireland, where he became a senior sub and an extremely
popular father of chapel (union official) at the <strong>Cork Examiner</strong>.</p>

<p>Later, he returned to Glasgow and worked as a casual on the <strong>Record</strong>
before taking up the post of chief reporter on the <strong>Highland News</strong>
in Inverness. His last job in journalism was with the <strong>County Press</strong>
on the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>Joe is survived by his son, Patrick, from his marriage to Liz Catterson.</p>
