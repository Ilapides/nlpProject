<p class="fst">Joe Owens was a young 18-year-old miner from Blackburn in West
Lothian when he joined Militant (the forerunner of the International
Socialists in Scotland and the Socialist Party of England and Wales)
in 1983. Joe was a leading figure in Militant in the East of
Scotland in the 1980&#8217;s &#8211; playing a key role at all levels of the
organisation. We first met him at a public meeting in Edinburgh in
support of the print workers who were on strike against Eddie Shah&#8217;s
attempts at the Messenger Group in Warrington to smash the print
unions. From the first Joe stood out as an outstanding public
speaker, full of passion, anger and not a little humour, as well as
an incredible depth of knowledge for someone so young. As was to be
the case throughout his too short a life, Joe, who was a force of
nature, made a huge impact on all those who had the privilege to know him.</p>

<p>Joe, like his father, worked in the Polkemmet colliery in West
Lothian where he was elected as the youth delegate for the NUM. When
the miners strike began in 1984 he was already a committed Marxist
and used all of his abilities to emerge as a leading figure in the
year long dispute. I vividly recall Joe Owens speaking in 1984 at the
Labour Party Young Socialists summer camp in the Forest Of Dean.
Hundreds of young socialists had packed into the marquee to hear the
opening rally on the miners strike. Joe Owens was billed to speak as
a young miner, perhaps for 5 or 10 minutes, with Ian Isaacs from the
South Wales NUM planning to develop the wider political issues of the
strike and the strategy to win. Joe, being Joe, spoke for over half
an hour covering everything from the strike, to the crisis of British
capitalism, the importance of a fighting trade union leadership by
the TUC and the need for socialist society. After a prolonged
standing ovation, Ian Isacs got up to speak commented; &#8220;well after
listening to Joe there is really nothing left for me to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Time and again during the strike, whether at mass meetings of
miners, fellow socialists or wider public meetings it was possible to
hear a pin drop when Joe Owens got up to speak. He was without doubt
one of the most outstanding public speakers in the socialist and
Marxist movement at the time. But Joe was more than just an orator of
real standing. He was as comfortable speaking about the Spanish
revolution, the black civil rights movement in the US, or dialectical
materialism as he was about the struggle of the miners. He devoured
books whether on Marxist theory, literature, history and also poetry
&#8211; which he had a real passion for. He was also a talented writer.
Joe was, in the best sense of the term, a worker intellectual who
loved to discuss ideas &#8211; but who was also a working class fighter
who hated injustice and instinctively supported workers in struggle
wherever they were.</p>

<p>Polkemmet colliery was, like so many pits after the strike, shut
and Joe moved to Bilston Glen outside Edinburgh. His standing among
his fellow miners was shown when he was elected to the highest
position in the union as the pit delegate of the NUM at Bilston Glen.
At the age of just 22, Joe was one of the youngest ever NUM pit
delegates to hold that position. But by 1989 Bilston Glen was also
closed, as the mining industry was decimated by Thatcher and the
criminals who surrounded her.</p>

<p>The defeat of the miners strike was a setback for the whole
working class. The more complicated situation for socialists and
Marxists in the 1990&#8217;s also affected Joe and he was no longer
active in the Marxist movement. Joe left the mining industry after
the closure of Bilston Glen and used his skills as a writer to train
as a journalist. He worked for a number of newspapers, including the
<strong>Daily Record</strong>, the <strong>Herald</strong> and the <strong>Cork Examiner</strong>
in Ireland, among others.</p>

<p>He did not cease his active involvement in the trade union
movement, nor his belief in socialism. He became the Chair of the
Scottish council of the NUJ. Even when he went to Ireland, such was
his impact, that he was elected as the Father of Chapel for the NUJ
at the <strong>Cork Examiner</strong> and fought to defend workers terms and
conditions. Joe also worked in Inverness, Valencia and, latterly, the
Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>In the months before his death he regularly visited the Vestas
workers occupation on the Isle of Wight, delivering food parcels
which he bought, even though he was without work at the time. He
marched in support of the Vestas workers in Cowes in August this
year. To the end he always knew which side he was on.</p>

<p>Joe left an impact on all those he met. Universally, his
intelligence, humour, passionate belief in fighting injustice, single
mindedness and concern for others other than himself are all cited by
those whose paths he crossed. The hundreds who attended his funeral
were testament to that. In truth the one person he did not seem to
regard enough was himself, despite all of his talents and humanity.</p>

<p>Joe Owens has died, aged just 44 years. I have lost a friend whom
I will always remember. More important his son, Patrick, has lost his
father and it is to him, to Joe&#8217;s brothers and sisters, and all
those who loved Joe Owens, that these few words are dedicated.</p>
