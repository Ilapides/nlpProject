<p class="fst"><em>THE COLOURFUL posters cry &#8220;Make it in Livingston&#8221;. Despite
the dubious nature of this slogan, it clearly advertises a rosy
future in Livingston for those skilled and interested in the
supposedly developing micro-chip industries.</em></p>

<p>But what prospects and benefits have the so-called &#8216;sunrise&#8217;
industries brought to Livingston, the &#8216;Silicon Glen&#8217; of West
Lothian. Looking behind the glamorous exterior of technical
development, reality is rather different. In Silicon Glen youth are
on the dole or in the dead end of Youth Training Schemes. The
Japanese and American multinationals who own the factories want
young, cheap, non-union labour; easy to exploit and then cast aside
when no longer required.</p>

<p>In Silicon Glen you&#8217;re told &#8220;too old at 18, over the hill at
20&#8221;. In West Lothian, home of the sunrise industries there is well
over 20% unemployment. Only a few miles from Livingston is one of the
most deprived areas of Britain, Blackburn.</p>

<p>Youth have taken to drugs and the glue as they are robbed more and
more each day of the hope of ever finding a job and future. The sun
has never risen for the working class in Silicon Glen. The
development of these space-age techniques has never been put to use
to help the unemployed and the poor.</p>

<p>A report last year from a committee headed by a former chief
scientist in Thatcher&#8217;s cabinet, said that Britain was headed for
third world status, because of &#8216;lack of investment in information
technology.&#8217; Tell that to the poor. There are no limitations for
developing the means of interstellar warfare, yet it has taken over a
year to get food to the starving children of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that the sunrise has been eclipsed by
the disease of the bosses system, the system that can no longer
provide the basic necessities. That system has no right to exist.
Youth must fight back and change it.</p>
