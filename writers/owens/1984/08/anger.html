<p class="fst"><em>WEST LOTHIAN miners reacted angrily to the first break in the
strike at Polkemmet colliery near Bathgate, West Lothian, last Monday
20 August. Polkemmet employs 1,400 men, and is a main supplier of
Ravenscraig steel works. Six scabs were taken into the pit at around
8 a.m. after the pickets had gone away to do the open cast, because
there seemed to be nothing happening.</em></p>

<p>The six went back in again on Tuesday; the pit delegates got to
speak to them. One said he wouldn&#8217;t return. The other five said
they would. On Wednesday, the police sneaked them in at 4.45 a.m.,
about an hour early before the pickets had arrived in any numbers.</p>

<p>The union had reacted by withdrawing safety cover at 7.30 on
Tuesday morning. Two hours later the underground power was shut off
by management and remained off.</p>

<p>Safety cover was restored when it became clear that severe damage
was being caused to the workings and the future of the pit might be
at stake.</p>

<p>But management stopped NACODS safety men from entering the pit on
Sunday night preventing any assessment for 12 hours &#8211; a long delay.</p>

<p>At the time of going to press it is unclear whether management
will claim that the pit is irretrievably damaged. Management&#8217;s
current claim that it would take a year to get back to production is
taken with a pinch of salt by Polkemmet miners.</p>

<p>On Tuesday there were 27 arrests, 26 men from Polkemmet and one
from Dalkeith who was arrested to breaking bail conditions. He was
picked out by police from Edinburgh. A special squad has been doing
the same on the Bilston Glen picket line &#8211; picking out anyone they
recognise as having been arrested previously.</p>
