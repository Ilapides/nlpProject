<h1>Bathgate occupation</h1>

<h3>(June 1984)</h3>

<p class="fst">THE DREAM of providing thousands of jobs in West Lothian with the
opening of the British Leyland (BL) plant in Bathgate was transformed
into a nightmare both for the 1,800 remaining workforce and the
future of the community, with the announcement on Tuesday 22 of the
closure of the plant.</p>

<p>The Scottish TUC has set up a steering committee to look at the
situation. This could be used to take the opportunity to link up the
fight to save BL with the fight to save the pits. It is an urgent
task.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Social consequences</h4>

<p class="fst">&#8220;Industrial genocide&#8221; was the way one worker described the
proposed closure. He was right, but the social consequences in an
area already ravaged with 20% unemployment would also be devastating.</p>

<p>If the plant closes, the surrounding towns of Bathgate, Armadale,
Blackburn, indeed the whole of West Lothian would be transformed from
a once thriving community into a waste land.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Slow death</h4>

<p class="fst">One senior shop steward outlined the run-down of the Bathgate
plant:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In 1978 we had 6,000 men but due to redundancies &#8211;
3&#8211;400 at a time we now only have 1,800 left &#8211; that is shop floor
workers and staff together. They have issued us 90 days&#8217; notice,
with 516 men being paid off on 20 August.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;They are going to transfer actual buildings to the
Albion from September 1984 to March 1985, meaning another 3&#8211;400 men
on the dole, then they intend to close us in 1986. We are all very
angry and we are solid, we are fighting for the community, if BL goes
West Lothian dies.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Another senior shop steward told me:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We are fighting for Scotland&#8217;s industrial base, we
are the last vehicle manufacturing plant in Scotland, they are not
closing us because of markets but because they have moved their
models down south. They have moved the tractors to Marshalls of
Gainsborough, cars to Motor Panels, Coventry, replacement vans to
Freight Power and six or seven models to BL in Lancashire &#8211; that&#8217;s
the problem.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Militancy</h4>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We had an excellent response from the men on the shop
floor and once they had decided to take action the staff decided the
same &#8211; we are fighting.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The fight is now clearly on, it is vital that the BL workers now
link up with other local struggles. The proposed closure of
Ravenscraig steelworks in 1986 means also the closure of Polkemmet.
The fight for coal is already on. It is clear that the fight is now a
joint one, it is a fight for jobs &#8211; yes, for an industrial base &#8211;
yes, but also a fight for every community in West Lothian.</p>
