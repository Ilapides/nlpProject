<p class="fst"><strong>&#8220;SATELLITE FALLS THROUGH WINDOW OF HOUSE AT SOUTHEND.&#8221; This
was front page news in most newspapers a couple of years ago when a
piece of broken-up satellite fell out of the sky.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine the consequences if a nuclear-powered satellite did the
same to a major city. This awful possibility became a reality two
weeks ago when the nuclear-powered Cosmos 954 satellite crashed,
fortunately on the barren wastes of Canada.</p>
<p>Why did this accident, which by all accounts did not even kill a
wolf, arouse so much fear and hostility? Why such prominent
publicity? The accident, apart from providing a glimpse for the first
time of the frightening and horrendous activities of two super powers
in space, underlies the insane and irresponsible policies that are
being perpetuated and which have resulted in over 4,500 satellites
permanently orbiting the planet.</p>
<p>Many of them are nuclear-powered and considered so dangerous that
they are &#8216;parked&#8217; at orbits of 800 miles when they are considered
of little use. They will remain at this height for several hundred
years until their radiation becomes harmless.</p>
<p>Moreover, in deliberately suppressing the news of the fate of the
satellite until it was about to crash, the super powers demonstrate
the bizarre extent they will go to in keeping their people in total
ignorance. Both powers knew since about November last year that the
satellite was going to crash and release deadly radiation that would
contaminate huge areas and lead to either increased mortalities or
cancer.</p>
<p>Also the satellite posed a double threat. In its decent to earth
the heat generated by friction would vaporise the 110&nbsp;lbs of
enriched uranium fuel and form a radioactive cloud that would not
only poison the air but take an astonishing 713 million years to
become harmless! More importantly, the intense heat could cause the
fuel to become critical &#8211; that is the least quantity of nuclear
material needed to produce an explosion &#8211; and explode as a nuclear
bomb! American scientists have now admitted that if the satellite had
failed one phase later in its decaying orbit, it would have plunged
into New York at the height of the morning rush hour!<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Not the First</h4>
<p class="fst">This has not been the first accident involving nuclear satellites.
To date three have crashed and released toxic radioactive waste, in
one case increasing the atmospheric radiation &#8211; itself present from
earlier weapons testing &#8211; by as much as 3%.</p>
<p>The most serious accident, which provides a preview of the
enormity of such a disaster, was when a disabled American nuclear
bomber jettisoned its two hydrogen bombs near the Spanish port of
Palomares. One bomb fell on shore, burst open and spilled radioactive
material over a wide area. Thousands of tons of
plutonium-contaminated soil were dug up. Some was transported to
America for disposal and some packed in drums and dumped in the
Atlantic. The other bomb fell into the sea and took months to locate
and salvage.</p>
<p>Since this accident reports have been received that both powers
are developing &#8216;killer satellites&#8217;; this has been called the
ultimate weapon. Such a vehicle would carry an explosive charge which
would detonate when close enough to another orbiting satellite. If
such a satellite experienced the same difficulties as Cosmos 954, the
nuclear material intended as bombs would detonate at some point in
its passage down. The magnitude of the disaster in terms of people
killed and long-term pollution would be unimaginable.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Life Endangered</h4>
<p class="fst">This is the terrible danger that lies in store for mankind if this
insanity continues. The development of nuclear weapons capable of
annihilating whole populations and the poisoning of the atmosphere
would inevitably lead to the extinction of all life. Every year has
witnessed a new form of fiendish weapon capable of wreaking greater
havoc than the one before, and always its development has been a
closely-guarded secret known only to a handful of bureaucrats or
capitalists.</p>
<p>This was highlighted by the frenzy of activity initially, between
Washington and Moscow and later Washington and NATO countries.
President Carter, in an attempt to allay public fears and soothe the
anti-nuclear campaigners, has called for a revision of the 1967 outer
space treaty which calls for exploration of outer space for peaceful
means only.</p>
<p><em>But there is only one solution to this madness. Take control of
science and technology out of the hands of the capitalists in the
West and the bureaucrats in the East through the establishment of a
Socialist World Federation.</em></p>
