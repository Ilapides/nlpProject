Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>The 1978 Notting Hill Carnival, which attracted a quarter of a
million people over the Bank holiday, was a tremendous success. This
was despite the provocations and inflammatory warnings of mass
muggings and widespread pick-pocketing issues by the police in the
days leading up to the event.</strong></p>
<p>But the success of the carnival was mainly due to the black youths
who demonstrated time and again that they were not going to be
intimidated and provoked into a confrontation with the police even
when this included such pointless exercises as the cordoning off of
half of Portobello Road, the main focal point of the celebrations.</p>
<p>The persistent drone of the police helicopter that hovered above,
and the police cine cameras blatantly spying on the crowds from the
overhead Westway motorway, heightened the tension. It was partly
these tactics of an unnecessary show of strength by the police that
were responsible for the outbreaks of violence later on Sunday
evening which led to the arrests of 42 people.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the carnival there will inevitably be the call
from conservative sections of the community to ban it from the
streets and confine it to enclosures like the White City. But it
would be completely wrong to justify the banning of the carnival on
the grounds of 42 arrests &#8211; which, by coincidence, is exactly the
number arrested at the Spurs match last Saturday, which only
attracted a fraction of the people present at the carnival.</p>
<p>The Borough council and the government must recognise that the
black community, who compromise 10% of the population of this area,
face huge social problems which are the direct result of the
capitalist system. Although, ironically, they reside in the
wealthiest borough in London they live in the most appalling
overcrowded, squalid houses. Next to Lewisham they have the highest
proportion of black youth unemployment.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Socialism</h4>
<p class="fst">Black youth need to get organised in a campaign to end their mass
unemployment, to destroy their slums, end police harassment and to
drive out racialism.</p>
<p>At the carnival the local Labour Party Young Socialists and PNP
Youth were out leafleting, selling the &#8216;Left&#8217; broadsheet against
racialism, <strong>PNP Youth Bulletins</strong> and <strong>Militant</strong>, and
recruiting new members. Along with paper selling and a bookstall we
had the best political showing over the two days.</p>
<p><em>Black youth must fight back against the real criminal in this
society &#8211; the landlords, bosses and profiteers! Join us in the
organised labour movement in the fight for a socialist society where
life can be colourful and happy not just at carnival time but all
year round.</em></p>
