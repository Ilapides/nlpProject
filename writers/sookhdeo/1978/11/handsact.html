<br />
<p class="fst">On October 1st the long awaited and much heralded regulations
governing the role of safety representatives and safety committees
took effect.</p>
<p>These regulations are a land mark in the history of the TU
movement. For the first time a trade union can now appoint its own
watchdog who has the legal right to put the place of work under
thorough examination.</p>

<p>Regular inspections can be carried out to root out hazards and
dangerous practices. Reps can visit the scene of an accident and
examine its causes, and demand from management and the Health and
Safety executive a wide range of information necessary for the job.
The safety representative is entitled to time off with pay to perform
these tasks and attend safety courses.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Step forward</h4>

<p class="fst">Undoubtedly, these new regulations represent a tremendous step
forward for the eight million workers now covered and for all those
affected by industrial pollution and hazards, whose health has for so
long been in the hands of lawyers and safety officers appointed by
management. Industrial accidents &#8211; estimated to cause 1,400 deaths
and over 300,000 serious injuries each year &#8211; and diseases, have
become subjects of increasing concern not only to trade unionist and
environmentalists but to the population as a whole.</p>

<p>But these regulations are being met with stiff opposition from
sections of the TU movement who regard them as a retrograde step. The
major bone of contention centres on section 7 of the Act which
transfers to the worker responsibilities already established under
previous legislation, such as the Factories Act, as solely the
responsibility of the employer.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Responsibility</h4>

<p>For example, the Act calls upon every employee to take reasonable
care not only of the health and safety of himself but of other
employees. <em>In fact, it is now a criminal offence to put oneself or
others at risk!</em> If the employee fails to comply, improvement
notices and even prohibition notices can be served, which carry a
maximum penalty of &#163;1,000.</p>

<p>In other words they can be sacked on the grounds that they
represent a potential hazard to themselves and to other workers!
Management, it is claimed, could use this section to avoid paying
compensation, and even dismiss workers. Since the passing of the Act,
there have been many reports of employers asking workers to sign
written declarations that they are responsible for their own safety.
It is quite evident that many employers will try and exploit every
loophole to dilute the duties that this legislation imposes on them.</p>

<p>Another contentious issues centres on the definition of the phrase
&#8216;reasonably practicable&#8217; which occurs in every section of the
Act. This is defined in terms of the cost of improving health and
safety as balanced against the risk of injury or ill health. If the
risk is insignificant compared to the cost then it would not be
&#8216;reasonably practicable&#8217; to do anything about it.</p>
<p>The ILEA, London&#8217;s largest employer, has just been forced to
issue a statement clarifying the meaning of the phrase but even this
is ambiguous. In their bulletin <strong>Health and Safety at work</strong> they
note that the phrase &#8216;reasonably practicable&#8217; occurs a great many
times in the Act and many staff are unclear about its implications.</p>

<p>There can be no general definition; the factors involved (e.g.
cost, risk) vary widely in different circumstances. Only the courts
will have the power to authoritatively interpret this phrase, in
dealing with cases referred to them. It is likely that over the years
a good deal of case law on this point will build up!</p>

<p>Finally, there is nothing in either the regulations or the Code of
Practice that commits the employers to do anything about the reports
from the safety reps or committees. Trade unionists will need to be
vigilant, and ensure that they have a thorough understanding of the
Act and its limitations. We must use the power we have won to the
full, while fighting for day-to-day trade union control of the
workplace to end the bosses&#8217; rule of &#8216;profit before safety&#8217;.</p>
