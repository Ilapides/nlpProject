<p class="fst">200 people killed! The 180 who survived are so seriously injured
that they must also be added to the list of fatalities!</p>
<p>These are the horrifying details now emerging from the gas tanker
explosion at the camping site at San Carlos de La Rapita, Spain, last
Tuesday.</p>
<p>The accident occurred when a tanker carrying 38 tonnes of
liquefied propylene &#8211; a highly inflammable chemical used to make
synthetic fibres collided with a brick wall, and hurtled 100 yards
into a camping site packed with holiday makers from Germany, Holland
and France.</p>
<p>Eye witnesses spoke of a mighty explosion followed by a huge fire
ball and then a rain of ignited liquid which saturated the whole
area.</p>
<p><em>Within seconds the searing heat reduced people nearest the
blast to smouldering charcoal. Those further away suffered appalling
injuries as the intense heat tore off their skins and were literally
boiled alive as they threw themselves into the sea that adjoined the
site.</em></p>
<p>The heat was so great that cars and caravans were reduced to mere
shells of metal as everything susceptible to flame vaporised and
produced choking fumes, moreover, the tanks of butane gas, used by
the campers for cooking, added to the casualties as they ignited and
exploded.</p>
<p>Such was the enormity of the holocaust that many workers searching
the camping site for bodies were so overcome with emotion as they
came across bodies burnt beyond recognition, that they were unable to
continue.</p>
<p>Feelings ran high amongst the survivors and relatives when it was
learnt that most of those injured were unlikely to survive because
they were so hideously burnt that plastic surgery was impossible.</p>
<p><em>They were further incensed when it was revealed that the
disaster could have been averted for a paltry Â£7 if the lorry driver
had used a new toll road rather than the narrow coastal highway.</em></p>
<p>The local population were angry and bitter but not surprised over
the accident. They have attacked the Governor of the Province for not
responding to the many requests to ban tankers from the highway.</p>
<p>Indeed, even on the day of the catastrophe, there was an accident
involving a tanker carrying vinyl chloride which was released into
the atmosphere. Vinyl chloride is a chemical notorious as a cancer
forming agent.</p>
<p>Belatedly, 48 hours after the accident, the Governor banned all
tankers carrying expensive cargoes from roads in built up areas, and
reduced the tolls on the new A7 road.</p>
<p>That it has taken a disaster of this magnitude to galvanise the
Governor into issuing a simple directive which would have saved the
many lives lost, should be seen as an indictment of the rotten
anarchic capitalist system whose only motivation is to increase
profits.</p>
<p>The ban is too late for the many families who are in their graves,
and those living whose lives have been wrecked, families who were
compelled by the very system and its accompanying economic
contradictions to seek out the cheapest form of holiday-making &#8211;
the camping site with its primitive amenities rather than the
expensive and luxurious hotels, only to be incinerated and subjected
to horrors that defy the imagination.</p>
<p><em>The catastrophe has sent reverberations throughout the
capitalist world, since most corrosive, poisonous, explosive and
inflammable substances are carried by road tankers.</em></p>
<p>The most recent accident was in Mexico City at the weekend, in
which 10 people died and another 200 seriously injured when a tanker
carrying liquefied natural gas blew up. This has put pressure on the
government to re-examine their policy on the transportation of
hazardous chemicals.</p>
<p>The disaster in Spain has demonstrated that whilst the workers
were moved to tears, the capitalists were moved only by other
considerations of profits. Will other chemical haulage companies now
change their routes and introduce safety precautions? Not on your
life! How long until a similar accident happens somewhere else?</p>
