<p class="fst"><strong>The National Conference of the People&#8217;s National Party Youth
[UK] which was held over two days in Birmingham at the weekend,
attracted over 100 black youths.</strong></p>

<p>It is a testimony to the success of the movement that in just one
year it could galvanise so many black youths from many parts of the
country.</p>

<p>It was more remarkable since the majority were unemployed.</p>
<p>The PNP Youth policy statement &#8211; <em>A Fighting Programme for
Black Youth</em> &#8211; was presented and unanimously accepted.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Unemployment</h4>

<p class="fst">The conference noted the continued harassment of young blacks by
sections of the police especially under the infamous &#8216;sus&#8217;
charges. This has been responsible for the arrests of over 3,000
people &#8211; more than half of them black &#8211; since 1973.</p>

<p>It also deplored the structure of the present education system
which has been consistently placing black children in educationally
subnormal schools from which they emerge almost illiterate.</p>

<p>The conference called for an end to racial discrimination in
schools and colleges, abolition of racist text books, the
introduction of a fully comprehensive education system and maximum
class sizes of 20 so that the 20,000 teachers on the dole can be
given work.</p>

<p>But it was the question of unemployment that really brought the
conference to life. It deplored the present high level of
unemployment in Britain in general and among blacks in particular.</p>
<p>The conference was told by Bob Lee, the National Secretary, that
while unemployment in the last four years rose by a staggering 120%
for the 15&#8211;25 age group, it increased by the phenomenal 410% for
black youth.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>&#8220;Almost half of those unemployed in the London
Borough of Lambeth are young blacks. In some inner city areas like
Handsworth, as many as six out of ten young blacks are jobless.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>The conference recognised that the capitalist system was incapable
of solving the many problems confronting the working class and the
only solution was the implementation of full socialist policies. It
resolved to fight for the following demands in the labour and trade
union movement:</p>

<ul>
<li>A minimum wage of &#163;70 a week<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>A 35-hour week<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Work or full pay<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Nationalisation of any firm that threatens redundancies<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Nationalisation of the big monopolies to finance a public
works programme to provide jobs, houses and schools.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h4>Workers&#8217; unity</h4>

<p class="fst">The conference unanimously agreed that with rising unemployment,
police harassment, and increased fascist attacks, the black community
must organise to safeguard their rights. We stand for the unity of
all workers, black and white, to fight ruthlessly against any attempt
to divide the working class or to divert from the struggle for
socialism.</p>

<p>Conference linked arms with the Labour Party Young Socialists who
are already waging the fight. Nick Bradley, the LPYS representative
on the Labour Party National Executive, in his fraternal address,
promised every help and called for the establishment of a Labour
Party/trade union defence force to defend the black community against
racist attacks.</p>

<p>Chelsea Morrison, a representative from the Black Women
Association, observed that the conference and the policy document had
omitted the issues of black women, which were of crucial importance
to the black community. A lively discussion ensued and it was agreed
a section on black women will be included in the policy document.</p>

<p>Earlier in the conference a representative from the South African
Congress of Trade Unions gave a very grim account of the terrible
conditions of the Africans under apartheid.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Liberation</h4>

<p class="fst"><strong>The conference noted in a most emphatic manner that they were
inspired by the victories of the liberation forces in Southern Africa
and in South East Asia and by the workers and peasants of Jamaica and
the whole Caribbean in their struggle against imperialism.</strong></p>
