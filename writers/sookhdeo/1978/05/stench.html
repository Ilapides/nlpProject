<p class="fst"><em>&#8220;We knew that a disaster had occurred because of the stench
of oil which hung over the whole area.&#8221;</em> This was the comment of
one of the villagers in Brittany, following the sinking of the <em>Amoco
Cadiz</em>, which released 220,000 tons of crude oil &#8211; described as
the world&#8217;s worst oil spillage &#8211; onto 300 miles of beach.</p>
<p>Exactly seven weeks later, this disaster was repeated for the
residents of Corton, a tiny camping site near Great Yarmouth.</p>

<p>They awoke to find their area engulfed in thick black oil. The
cause this time was the 12,000 ton Greek oil tanker, the <em>Eleni&nbsp;V</em>,
which was sliced into by the French merchant vessel, the <em>Roseline</em>.</p>

<p>Accidents like this are not acts of God but arise from the
incompetence, corruption and greed of the oil and shipping barons in
their lust for easy and quick profits.</p>

<p>What is the basis for these charges? Most of the oil discharged
into the sea is the result of deliberate policy on the part of
shipping monopolies. Before the closure of the Suez Canal, oil
tankers returning to the Gulf with oil residues and waste still in
the ballast found that the Canal authorities regarded it as cargo and
it was therefore subject to dues. So the waste was discharged into
the seas.</p>

<p>This is now widely practised and is having frightening
repercussions. In the last few years port authorities have imposed a
ban on empty oil tankers entering the harbours unless their ballasts
are completely free of the combustible gas left behind when the oil
is discharged.</p>

<p>This fear of explosion has led to the port authorities in Valetta,
Malta, for example, banning all oil tankers. In order to use the
harbour facilities the tankers therefore use the most expedient
method, that is flushing out the tanks with sea water.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Discharges</h4>

<p class="fst">At present the release of oily ballast water accounts for 1.5
million out of the 1.8 million tons of oil discharged annually into
the sea. The Mediterranean alone receives 100,000 tons of oil
annually. The Gulf of Muggia near Trieste, which receives effluent
from a complex of refineries, has become a biological desert &#8211;
devoid of even the most primitive plant life.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Oil Clots</h4>

<p class="fst">Recent evidence has suggested that the oceans are rapidly
approaching this state. Thor Heyerdahl describes a grim scene of oil
pollution in the Atlantic during his crossing with the papyrus raft
<em>Ra&nbsp;1</em>. A few days out of the harbour of Safi in Morocco he
and his companions found themselves sailing through a mass of opaque
water containing large quantities of solidified oil clots.</p>

<p>Two days after escaping this polluted area they came across
another, and yet another, in mid-ocean. Some six hundred miles off
Barbados, they sailed in polluted waters for two days.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>New Regulations?</h4>

<p class="fst">The increasing concern and growing militancy of trade unions and
environmentalists in both America and Europe, together with the
unprecedented series of thirteen tanker accidents in the US alone,
has caused President Carter to re-examine existing tanker regulations.</p>

<p>He has called for an international conference under the auspices
of the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO),
the United Nations Agency concerned with shipping. Their suggestion
is that all existing tankers of 20,000 deadweight tons or more should
be fitted with segregated ballast tanks (SBTs).</p>

<p>The use of separate tanks removes the need to fill cargo tanks
with sea water to maintain the tanker&#8217;s stability after unloading.
This has immediately been attacked by oil monopolies on the grounds
that the cost of converting existing tankers to SBT would be too high
&#8211; figures of $300,000 to $3m per vessel have been quoted.</p>

<p>They in turn have advocated a combination of techniques known as
&#8216;crude oil washing&#8217; and &#8216;load on top&#8217;. These two processes
they argue, would &#8220;only&#8221; discharge 130,000 tons of oil annually
into the sea.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the working class, however, fitting
tankers with SBTs would not only go a long way towards purifying the
seas, and cutting down the risk of further disasters. It would also
provide much needed jobs to thousands of shipyard workers, suffering
from the decline of their industry.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Clean Up</h4>

<p><em>The oil and shipping monopolies have grown fat at our expense
and at the expense of the environment. The trade unions must force
them to foot the bill to clean up the environment. If they refuse
they must be cleaned out themselves by full socialist measures.</em></p>
