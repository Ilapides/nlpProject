<p class="fst"><strong>The news last week that a tanker carrying 38 tons of highly
inflammable propane gas jack-knifed and overturned in a densely
populated area at Loughton, Essex, once again highlights the dangers
of transporting hazardous and highly explosive chemicals by road.</strong></p>
<p>In the Loughton accident, one of the three gas cylinders ruptured
&#8211; and it was only sheer chance that a major catastrophe like the
ones in Spain and Mexico two weeks ago was averted.</p>
<p>In both disasters, tankers carrying liquefied gas exploded on
collision and sent fireballs together with a rain of ignited liquid
over a wide area. It only took a matter of seconds to incinerate
hundreds of people and hideously burn thousands.</p>
<p>In the Mexican holocaust, people as far away as ten miles away
suffered burns as the wind diffused the gas which detonated with the
slightest friction.</p>
<p>This latest accident, following a number of serious mishaps in the
last week alone in which many people were treated for formaldehyde,
methanol and chlorine poisoning has provoked widespread indignation &#8211;
especially when it was revealed that the local village could have
been wiped out had the gas ignited.</p>
<p>The driver of the tanker, moreover, compounded the fears of the
residents by saying that he knew that the accident would happen some
day. He went on to say that the company has had a number of such
accidents in the past!</p>
<p>It is hardly surprising that there is such a high frequency of
accidents involving chemical containers when 41% of all petroleum
products are sent by road. These are in addition to other highly
toxic and noxious chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and sulphuric
acid.</p>
<p>Even more surprising, there is at present no compulsory system for
identifying the chemical in case of spillage, nor standard methods
for treating and rendering harmless, and above all guidance for
treatment of people exposed and overcome by fumes.</p>
<p>The present signs say nothing of the poisonous nature of the
chemical, that is whether it damages the nervous system or is a
cumulative poison, its antidote, and above all how to neutralise and
dispose in case of spillage.</p>
<p>The labour and trade union movement must take up the fight for
initially a re-routing of dangerous chemicals from densely populated
areas, until a safe method of transportation system can be introduced
and for a more effective labelling system.</p>
