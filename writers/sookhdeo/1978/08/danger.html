<p class="fst"><em>The news last week that a total of 21 workers at the top secret
atomic weapons research establishment have abnormally high amounts of
plutonium dust in their lungs has catapulted the controversial issues
of the toxicity of plutonium and radiation levels into national prominence.</em></p>

<p>Apart from providing a glimpse of the activities of the
scientists, the news also shatters the myth that plutonium emission
is tightly controlled, and constitutes no danger to workers.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Relatively large amounts of plutonium can be eaten without
appreciable harm,&#8221;</em> was the claim made by none other than
Justice Parker in his report on the Windscale Inquiry. This is now
being used by the Ministry of Defence in an attempt to ally mounting
public fears with the revelations that nuclear workers contract
cancer at unusually high rates.</p>

<p>When told that he had been exposed to three and a half times the
&#8220;safe level of radiation&#8221;, a 59-year-old process worker at the
research establishment crystallised the feelings of all the workers.
&#8220;It was a terrible shock,&#8221; he said, <em>&#8220;but what of the future?&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Indeed, what of the future? Many thousands of workers are being
exposed daily to the current safety levels of 5 rems (unit of
radiation) a year. In the last year alone a mountain of evidence has
been published linking extremely low dosages of radiation with the
increase in cancer deaths.</p>

<p>Horrifying statistics have come from America. Studies of the death
certificates and radiation exposure records of workers at the
Hansford nuclear plant in Washington have revealed a disturbingly
high incidence of cancer of the pancreas and leukaemia. All the
workers were exposed to levels of radiation well within the agreed
safety limits.</p>

<p>But the most alarming results have come from a chance discovery.
The overall cancer death rate among civilian nuclear workers at the
navy&#8217;s Portsmouth Shipyard in Kittery Maime was more than twice the
national average and well above that of the yard&#8217;s non-nuclear workers.</p>

<p>These figures were calculated by a doctor, who asked the navy for
the workers&#8217; records. They flatly refused. He filed a law suit
under the Freedom of Information Act, and they promptly reversed
their position and released the records.</p>

<p>The navy had good reason for maintaining an iron hold over these
records. The results were startling. <em>The Portsmouth study showed
that the rate of leukaemia was an incredible 450% higher than the
general population and the incidence of lymph gland cancer was 125%
higher. And the workers were only exposed to an astonishingly low 1
rem of radiation per year.</em></p>

<p>These studies have conclusively demonstrated that there is no safe
level of radiation exposure. Cancer can develop in a long agonising
process. So the full extent of radiation damage caused by plutonium
is unlikely to be known until too late.</p>

<p>The only way to avoid this is for the labour and trade union
movement to initiate a campaign for the complete medical examination
of all radiation workers and for comprehensive dossiers, maintained
and made public.</p>

<p><em>Moreover, in the same way as the trade unions fought to bring
down the safety level from an incredible 73 rems a year in 1931 to
the current 5 rems, we must now call for the complete abolition of
&#8220;safety levels&#8221;, and the recognition that all levels cause cancer.</em></p>
