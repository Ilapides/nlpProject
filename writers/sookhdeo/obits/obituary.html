<h1>Ronnie Sookhdeo 1946&#8211;2014</h1>
<h3>(October 2014)</h3>

<p class="info">From <strong>The Socialist</strong>, No.&nbsp;831, 29 October 2014.<br/>
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">For almost 40 years, Ronnie Sookhdeo was a comrade in Militant and
then the Socialist Party. Unfortunately, ill health in recent years
prevented him from being active. However, he always gave generously
to the Socialist Party and kept abreast of developments through our
paper.</p>
<p>He emigrated from what became Guyana with his family as a young
boy and lived in Islington. Later, he married Viv and they moved to
the same street as us. Our families became good friends, starting
with our children playing together. We soon realised we had common
political ideas. His father had been a trade union organiser involved
with Cheddi Jagan and the People&#8217;s Progressive Party (PPP).<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Anti-racist</h4>
<p class="fst">After a few discussions he quickly joined Militant. He was
particularly eager to participate in our anti-racist and anti-fascist
work. He played a leading role in the formation of the PNP Youth in
Britain alongside others and later of Panther UK. This group
organised the biggest indoor meeting of black and Asian youth in
Britain, addressed by Bobby Seale, the well-known US Black Panther
leader.</p>
<p>He was also a talented scientist, having been a chemistry lecturer
at Kingsway College for many years, where he was also an active trade
unionist. He read widely and avidly on politics, science and history,
particularly black and Asian history; he also delved into the history
of Ancient Greece and the Far East and was always keen to discuss
what he had read. He also taught himself Russian.</p>
<p>He had a very sunny disposition and his infectious good humour
touched many people. However, this did not prevent him from leaving
the Labour Party in disgust when socialists were expelled. He could
not tolerate the right-wing deserters of socialist principles.</p>
<p>He will be sadly missed, and our heartfelt sympathy goes to Viv,
his wife, his five children, many grandchildren and all his family.</p>
