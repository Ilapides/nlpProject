<p class="fst"><strong>The brutal car-bomb assassination of Dr Walter Rodney earlier
this year gave an indication of the growing crisis in Guyana and the Caribbean.</strong></p>

<p>Dr Rodney, was the leader of the left wing Working People&#8217;s
Alliance and a vociferous critic of the Burnham regime.</p>

<p>Within the country, the murder precipitated a wave of industrial
unrest and acts of sabotage which is having serious repercussions on
the economy. That unrest has not died down.</p>

<p>A &#8216;national disobedience campaign&#8217; brought the country to a
standstill and shook the Burnham regime. More importantly, it united
for the first time all the strands of opposition.</p>

<p>Since Burnham came to power in 1964 in collusion with the CIA he
has used constitutionality in order to mask his corrupt and
repressive policies. He has maintained his government in office by
all manner of electoral frauds &#8211; which have included the votes of
children and nationals from other countries in the West Indies.</p>

<p>In the recent period he has cancelled all elections and changed
the constitution to safeguard his position and ensure his rule for
life! He has also had an increasing reliance on thugs, pseudo
religious groups and reactionary forces.</p>

<p>When the crisis of capitalism in the period 1973&#8211;75 devastated
the fragile Guyanese economy, Burnham was compelled by the pressure
of the masses to nationalise the foreign-owned sugar and bauxite
monopolies &#8211; 80% of the economy is now in the hands of the government.</p>

<p>Declaring his policies as Burnham-Leninist and his party as
Marxist-Christian this former stooge of imperialism resorts to
demagogic slogans in order to hide the mounting chaos of his economic policies.</p>

<p>But only a genuine workers&#8217; state with complete nationalisation
of the remaining big firms together with a plan of production based
on workers&#8217; control and management could have begun to eliminate
the bureaucracy and chaos that is stultifying the economy.</p>

<p>A plan of production, of workers and small farmers&#8217; councils
management of the economy, right of recall with regular rotation and
controlled wage differentials would not only have abolished the
racist divisions but provided the basis for better living standards
in the region.</p>

<p>The present economic crisis highlights the dangers of not
implementing socialist policies. The country&#8217;s principal foreign
exchange earners, sugar and bauxite have both declined dramatically
due to a combination of strikes, mismanagement, adverse weather
conditions and the slump on the world market.</p>

<p>For the second year running the government has had to scale down
its sugar targets from 360,000 tons to 300,000 tons. Similarly, the
27% drop in bauxite production has been responsible for the massive
foreign exchange deficit of &#163;50m.</p>

<p>The government desperate for aid for an economy already bankrupted
through paying for the huge oil price increase and foreign goods have
negotiated loans from the world bank, West Germany and the IMF.</p>

<p>The repayments on these loans are now higher than the new loans
being sought. The IMF continues to exert a stranglehold on the
economy.</p>

<p>The government was compelled to carry through savage cuts in
public expenditure and adopt deflationary policies in order to curb
the spiralling inflation. As a consequence unemployment has rocketed
to over 50% with a further 30% underemployment.</p>

<p>Food, fuel costs and other essential commodities have all
increased astronomically whilst wages have been held down to 5%. This
savage cutback in living standards is fuelling an explosion from
below.</p>

<p>The enormous discontent within the country is reflected in the
growth of the Working People&#8217;s Alliance. They have managed to form
an alliance against Burnham which has cut across the racial divide.</p>

<p>In the past this racial divide helped to consolidate the unpopular
Burnham regime. Burnham, unable to contain the explosive situation
has now turned back to the USA and has given an assurance to open up
the country to private capital.</p>

<p>The murder of Dr Rodney and subsequent mass imprisonments will not
stop the movement against the Burnham regime. The growth of the WPA
indicates that Guyana is bound to face further and more serious
upheavals in the next period.</p>
