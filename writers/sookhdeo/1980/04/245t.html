<p class="c"><strong>In a two part article Ronnie Sookhdeo shows the chemical
industry under control of the bosses is a danger to workers.</strong></p>

<p class="fst">News that the household herbicides and pesticides contain 2,4,5&nbsp;T,
a highly toxic chemical believed by scientists to be responsible for
a horrifying increase in birth defects, skin diseases and cancer, has
again rightly intensified demands for the tighter screening and
control of potentially dangerous chemicals.</p>

<p>At the moment the major manufacturer of 2,4,5&nbsp;T is refusing
to release the results of medical studies on their workforce. There
have also been allegations of a Watergate-style break-in at the home
of a doctor who has been investigating the effects of 2,4,5&nbsp;T.</p>
<p>It has also come out that Mr Dennis Thatcher, the prime minister&#8217;s
husband, is a director of a firm producing weed-killer based on 2,4,5&nbsp;T.</p>

<p>Predictably, there have been the by now almost customary
government claims that the chemical is absolutely safe, and that the
eight unions and six local authorities which have banned it have
acted out of scientific ignorance.</p>

<p>So what is the truth concerning 2,4,5&nbsp;T? What hazards does it
really pose to the public?</p>

<p>The chemical Tricholorophenoxyacetic Acid (2,4,5&nbsp;T) and it
impurity Dioxin &#8211; described as the most lethal man-made poison ever
&#8211; have both achieved notoriety in a remarkably short period of time.</p>

<p>Dioxin is produced during the synthesis of the base chemical
Trichlorophenol, which is used in the manufacture of two chemicals,
hexachlorophene and 2,4,5&nbsp;T, with Dioxin being retained as an
impurity in both substances.</p>

<p>Hexachlorophene, a bactericide, was widely used as a wash for
treating acne, in soaps, surgical swabs and as an antiseptic in
hospital nurseries. But in the late 1960s evidence began to
accumulate linking its use with internal and brain damage. Its use
was supposed to have ceased after a dramatic occurrence of infant
mortalities in England and France.</p>

<p>Talcum powder containing hexachlorophene was daubed on the bottoms
of new-born babies. In the most recent case last month, the
manufacturer and distributor of talcum powder which killed 33 babies
in France received suspended sentences.</p>

<p>The herbicide 2,4,5&nbsp;T has had a much more chequered history.
It was formulated with another chemical and called &#8220;Agent Orange&#8221;.
This was used by the US military with devastating and horrendous
effects in Vietnam. Over 90 million pounds of Agent Orange was
sprayed over Vietnam and a staggering 10% of the population was
exposed to it.</p>

<p>The full horror of Dioxin poisoning was revealed to the West when
the Swiss-owned Icmesa plant exploded in Seveso, Italy, in 1976.
Within days of the explosion rashes began to break out on the skin of
babies and young children, followed by acute diarrhoea and severe
vomiting. People began to suffer headaches, excessive violent
sweating and to experience liver and kidney pains.</p>

<p>But the most horrific result was the high incidence of spontaneous
abortions amongst pregnant women and the birth of grotesquely
malformed babies.</p>

<p>Today, four years after the Seveso incident, the region produces
more deformed babies, including mongoloids, than the whole of the
rest of Western Europe!</p>

<p>This calamitous mishap, sounding like a horror story from a
science-fiction book describing the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust,
is a searing indictment of the misuse and perversion of science and
technology in capitalist society. When profit is the ultimate motive
for development, the risks of serious danger to health and damage to
the environment are strictly secondary considerations.</p>

<p>Although big business complains ever more loudly about health and
safety regulations, in most countries, including Britain, the laws
and procedures used for checking new products and controlling the
production and use of dangerous substances are woefully inadequate.</p>

<p>The enormity of the crime committed against the people of Seveso
becomes even clearer when it is realised that the disaster in Italy
was not the first accident for the Swiss manufacturers.</p>

<p>There had already been accidents in the United States, Britain,
West Germany and Holland. In each case, the whole plant had to be
destroyed and buried in deep underground wells.</p>

<p>In the British accident, at the Coalite factory in Bolsover in
April 1968, seventy-nine men were affected by 2,4,5&nbsp;T fumes!</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>In <a href="../05/245t.html" target="new">part II</a> next week, Ronnie Sookhdeo gives more evidence of
the serious effects in Britain of 2,4,5&nbsp;T on the health of
workers and their families, and explains the urgent need for stronger
health and safety safeguards under the control on the trade unions.</strong></p>
