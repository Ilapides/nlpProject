<p class="c"><strong>Second part of an article by Ronnie Sookhdeo</strong></p>

<p class="fst"><em>The catastrophic accident at the Swiss-owned plant producing
2,4,5,&nbsp;T at Seveso, Northern Italy, sent shockwaves throughout
the industrialised capitalist countries.</em></p>

<p><em>The horrifying effects [described in <a href="../04/245t.html" target="new">part 1</a> last week] on the
immediate victims of the poison gas cloud, and the numerous
miscarriages and deformed births experienced by women pregnant at the
time, forced government, chemical companies, and independent
researchers to pay more attention to this highly toxic substance,
used among other things in household herbicides and insecticides.</em></p>

<p><em>Medical investigators embarked upon a systematic study of
2,4,5,&nbsp;T. It was soon established that US Vietnam veterans,
farmers in Oregon, and babies in Queensland, Australia, were all
suffering from the same complaints as those in Seveso.</em></p>

<p>They were all found to have sight problems and nervous maladies.
But the most striking symptom was the partial sterility of the men,
and the almost 100% incidence of deformed births.</p>

<p>In both Oregon and Queensland, farmers has been spraying their
plantations with 245T and the herbicide had seeped into the rivers
and streams and found their way into domestic water supplies.</p>

<p>However, the most damning evidence linking 245T with these various
symptoms comes from Britain: farm workers in Derbyshire, railwaymen
in Yorkshire and forestry workers in Wales and elsewhere, were all
found either to be sterile or to have contracted chloroacne &#8211; a
skin disease. British Rail admitted it sprayed herbicides containing
245T on their tracks every year.</p>

<p>Under enormous pressure from the trade unions, the TUC have now
called upon the Ministry of Agriculture to follow the US, Italy,
Sweden, Denmark, and Holland in banning 245T.</p>

<p>They have demanded, moreover, that the Ministry re-open its
enquiry into the pesticide &#8211; there have been eight inquiries over
the past years. More importantly, they have asked that the Health and
Safety Executive should be responsible for monitoring the production
and use of 245T.</p>

<p>This follows allegations that the manufacturers of 245T, Coalite
and Chemical Products is withholding two confidential reports on the
health of workers exposed to dioxin at their Derbyshire plant.</p>

<p>A third report, leaked earlier this month, showed that men exposed
to dioxin were at greater risk of contracting heart and liver
disease. Even more disturbing, however, has been the reported
break-in at the home of the medical investigator and the loss of
vital medical records.</p>

<p>This company evidently has very good reasons for keeping silent.</p>

<p>The <strong>Sunday Times</strong> has revealed as many as four out of five
workers who worked in the same shift have developed heart complaints.</p>

<p>The case of 245T highlights the absurd inadequacy of the present
legislation concerning toxic chemicals. Throughout the regulations,
the procedures which are really required to test and regulate
dangerous processes and products are subordinated to the narrow
commercial interests of the chemical companies.</p>

<p>A company has the right, for instance, to withhold scientific and
medical information which may be &#8220;of commercial importance.&#8221; This
&#8216;let out&#8217; clause &#8211; clearly intended to safeguard profitability
&#8211; can always be invoked to avoid revealing information absolutely
vital for assessing the risk a substance poses to the health of the
workforce, and to the population at large.</p>

<p>If, moreover, a company manufactures less than one ton of chemical
a year it is under no obligation to perform screening tests for
toxicity before manufacturing the product. On this basis, 245T has
been given a clean bill of health! The regulations apparently take no
account of the fact that minute quantities of some substances may be
lethal in their effects.</p>

<p>All the available evidence strongly suggests that there is no safe
level of exposure to 245T as the government has tried to maintain in
the past. Since cancer and other diseases tend to develop slowly, the
effects of a toxic chemical like this are unlikely to be known until
it is too late.</p>

<p>The only way to avoid long-term poisoning of the workers involved
and other members of the community is for the labour and trade union
movement to initiate a campaign for the total outlawing of 245T.</p>

<p>Such a campaign must demand the full revelation of all the results
of all the relevant tests, whether from government or company
sources, together with the thorough medical examination of all
workers who may have been exposed to the chemical. The trade unions
must insist that comprehensive medical records are kept and made
available to the public.</p>

<p>The dangers of toxic chemicals like 245T, raise more fundamental
questions. The labour movement, for instance, must challenge the myth
upheld by big business experts that pesticides and insecticides are
essential to provide the food that we need. Of course, according to
the market economy outlook of big business, it is &#8216;obvious&#8217; that
the solution to the problems of agricultural producers &#8211;
increasingly dominated by the big monopolies of the &#8216;agribusiness&#8217;
&#8211; is for the chemical industry to produce these highly profitable products.</p>

<p>But there are potentially many more effective methods that could
be used, with much less harmful results to the environment and to
consumers, such as the planned rotation of crops, growing on smaller
areas, and the planned management of insect populations.</p>

<p>The horrendous effects of substances like 245T show that safety
checks must be introduced long before the chemicals reach the
production stage. The trade unions should be satisfied on safety
before production is started. They should also be satisfied that the
process for the manufacture of the chemicals are also safe for the
workers involved and the surrounding community and environment.</p>

<p>There will always be a fundamental contradiction in capitalist
society between the development of sciences and technology, which
demands a rational and rounded-out approach, and the application of
the results of science by big business enterprises, which are
primarily concerned to maximise their profits and whose operations
are at every stage conditioned by the anarchy of the market and
competition with their rivals.</p>

<p>The potentially disastrous results of the one-sided and short
sighted development of new chemicals, new biological agents, and
other enormously powerful physical processes, make it more than
imperative that science and technology is taken out of the hands of
the capitalist class and put into the hands of the working people
through the socialist reorganisation of production.</p>
