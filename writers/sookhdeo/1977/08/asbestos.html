<p class="fst"><em>This year will see the publication of the long-awaited report
on asbestos by the government-created Advisory Committee on Asbestos.
Many of the business and other interests who profit from the use of
asbestos, or who are loath to meet the cost of its replacement, are
already viewing the Committee&#8217;s findings more optimistically than
before. They have been encouraged by the interim statement issued in
January and, more recently, by the confusion arising from
controversial evidence presented to the committee and subsequent
legal actions.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">The January statement reiterated the existing safety limits of
asbestos at work and in the home on the grounds that, as yet, there
is &#8220;insufficient data relating the prevalence of asbestos-induced
disease to the doses of asbestos received to revise the 1969 safety standard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The standard referred to was based solely on data provided by a
Rochdale asbestos factory on its 290 workforce. The study found in
1968 that only 3% of the men had developed asbestosis. In a smaller
group of 80 men exposed to between 3 and 6 fibres per cubic
centimetre of air only one had asbestosis. On the basis of this
<em>solitary</em> study the government proposed a safety limit of two
fibres per cu.&nbsp;cm. for all workers working with asbestos.</p>
<p>It was later learned, however, that the data from which this limit
was derived was provided by company sources with no outside
confirmation. The method used, moreover, to determine the dust counts
were inexact by scientific standards. Re-evaluation of the data
showed that by 1972, 26 of the 290 had confirmed asbestosis &#8211;
almost one in ten!</p>

<p>In addition, there was a sharp increase in lung cancer and a
combination of lung and abdominal cancers amongst workers who were
exposed to this level of asbestos dust. The asbestos worker who
smoked increased his chances of contracting the disease eight-fold.</p>

<p>These findings have now been confirmed by research scientists in
America. In fact, one such scientist has estimated that up to 40% of
one million Americans who have been exposed to asbestos will die of
cancer. This represents the colossal figure of 250,000 deaths! This
has been borne out by a US National Institute of Occupational Safety
and Health report which states that: &#8220;Excessive cancer risks have
been demonstrated at <em>all</em> fibre concentrations studies to
date.&#8221; (Our emphasis)</p>

<p>If, as this report says, <em>all concentrations of asbestos dust
produce cancer</em>, then it raises serious questions about the
continuing use of asbestos at all and not just, as in the present
debate, what the safety limit should be.</p>

<p>This makes the latest recommendation of the British Advisory
Committee even more extraordinary, upholding, as it does, its
previous stance on safety limits and blatantly disregarding the new
evidence.</p>
<p>Even more controversial is the evidence being submitted to the
Committee by certain scientists which has resulted in a good deal of
in-fighting. A report in the July issue of <strong>New Scientist</strong>
indicates the intense controversy now going on:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Evidence given at a recent meeting on asbestos could
result in a libel action. Dr. Robert Murray, the ex-medical adviser
to the Trades Union Congress, is &#8220;seeking legal advice&#8221; about a
statement made at a public meeting of the Advisory Committee on
Asbestos which he believes defamatory. Murray is concerned about
allegations made by Alan Dalton of the British Society for Social
Responsibility in Science [BSSRS], particularly because Murray&#8217;s
reputation as an independent consultant is at stake.</p>

<p class="quote">The contentious allegation is that Dr Murray was paid
&#163;20,000 to tell an Irish planning inquiry that asbestos should not
be banned, changing previous statements he had made on the issue. The
controversial part of Dalton&#8217;s statement to the Advisory Committee
on Asbestos is: &#8220;If you look in some of the unpublished evidence to
the committee you&#8217;ll find there a safety officer saying that he
heard Dr Robert Murray &#8211; then the TUC doctor &#8211; say that asbestos
should be banned. A few weeks ago Dr Robert Murray was saying that
asbestos was all right &#8211; this was in Cork in Ireland. He was paid
&#163;20,000 by the asbestos industry to say that and that may have
influenced his decision.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The planning inquiry was seeking a new site for the dumping of
asbestos from a new &#163;4 million plant making brake linings near Cork.
Raybestos, Manhatten, the owners of the plant, had already been
refused permission for one dumping site because of local objections.</p>

<p>Similarly, Dr Richard Dell, Regius Professor of Medicine at
Oxford, has claimed that an unfortunate misprint in the published
proceeding of a conference on asbestos has wrongly given the
impression that he was calling for a complete ban of all asbestos
when in fact he was only referring to blue asbestos. Professor Dell
is head of the DHSS Cancer Epidemiology and Clinical Trials Unit
which was responsible for the survey of workers of Rochdale.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Objective?</h4>

<p class="fst">There have also been claims that attempts were made to exert
pressure on researchers in order to play down their analysis of the
high incidence of cancer amongst workers using asbestos. It was
implied that such findings would prejudice the good relations between
&#8220;researchers and the asbestos industry.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is for these reasons that workers in the asbestos industry must
take note of the current situation and be prepared to make the
strongest possible representations at these meetings to reinforce the
TUC call for replacement of all asbestos products with safe
alternatives. This is particularly important in the face of what
certainly looks like an attempted &#8220;cover up&#8221; operation in
relation to this major hazard.</p>

<p>Sweden has already imposed a ban on asbestos. Denmark has followed
suit and outlawed asbestos-insulation. In this country two
nationalised industries, the Post Office and Electricity Board, have
already taken the initiative and banned it.</p>

<p>It is clear that there is no such thing as a &#8220;safe limit&#8221;. The
trade union movement must now be to the fore in calling for a
complete ban on the use of asbestos. Alternative jobs must be found
for asbestos workers. There should be immediate studies to cost the
introduction of alternatives to asbestos and to make sure that the
possible substitutes are themselves completely safe to use. We must
also demand stringent medical checks and a register of all workers
exposed to this hazard, from the do-it-yourself enthusiast to those
living near asbestos plants.</p>
