<p class="fst"><em>The Windscale inquiry which has recently concluded at a cost of
&#163;2 million has generated enormous controversy on the issue of
nuclear energy.</em></p>

<p>Big business and the nuclear lobby, which stands to profit from
the continued development of the nuclear programme and particularly
the waste disposal plans for Windscale itself, are optimistic that a
decision in their favour is about to be made. By the same token, all
those who stand for a sane energy programme, and in particular the
labour movement, will be alarmed and outraged if the government
ratifies this programme.</p>

<p>World attention, already roused by this issue, is sharply focused
on Britain. The question of nuclear energy will be of crucial
importance not only to workers in the industry but the labour
movement as a whole.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Protest</h4>

<p class="fst">The Windscale inquiry, amid heated controversy, began to consider
British Nuclear Fuel&#8217;s application for a &#163;600 million expansion of
Windscale, principally to reprocess Japanese nuclear waste, <em>which
could effectively make Britain the nuclear dustbin of the world</em>.
Moreover, it would introduce fundamental and controversial issues
like proliferation, storage, transport and ultimately the disposal of
plutonium, described as the most toxic substance ever made by man.</p>
<p>These issues have already generated enormous hostility and
precipitated a wave of unrest throughout the industrialised countries
of the world.</p>

<p>In far-off Australia, over 30,000 workers attended rallies in
Sydney and Melbourne to protest against the government&#8217;s $2 billion
uranium mining and exporting policies.</p>

<p>In Frankfurt, over 20,000 demonstrated against the building of the
prototype Fast Breeder Reactor. Demonstrations on the same scale have
occurred in Switzerland, Belgium, the USA and Japan.</p>

<p>In the ugliest and bloodiest incident so far, over 30,000
demonstrators at Creys-Malville in France, were attacked by police
and para-military riot police armed with sub-machine guns and
percussion grenades. This resulted in one man being killed and scores
more injured.</p>

<p>The inquiry which began in Whitehaven on the 6th June was the
result of tremendous pressure from trade unionists and
environmentalists following a succession of horrific reports
concerning plutonium.</p>

<p>It began with the alarming disclosure that radio-active water was
leaking at a rate of 100 gallons a day from Windscale!</p>
<p>This coincided with the post mortem results on three workers from
the plant, which revealed that they died from leukaemia. This could
have been induced only by plutonium which is obtained from the
reprocessed nuclear fuel. In fact it was found in the brains of one
of the dead men!</p>

<p>The link between plutonium and the high incidence of cancer was
conclusively established a week later by British researchers at the
American nuclear plant at Hansford and also by scientists here in Britain.</p>

<p>This immediately caused a tremendous furore which intensified with
the publication by Dr. Zhores Medvedev, a dissident Russian scientist
living in Britain, of an account of a catastrophic nuclear accident
involving plutonium. Thousands of scientists and villagers were
killed when a production plant exploded and released a cloud of
plutonium dust which swept across the surrounding countryside. This
occurred in the winter of 1957.</p>

<p>Medvedev&#8217;s revelation brought an immediate denunciation by Sir
John Hill the chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority, who described
the accident as &#8220;science fiction&#8221; and &#8220;a figment of the
imagination&#8221;. However, for what it is worth, the accident has since
been &#8220;confirmed&#8221; by such unlikely sources as the CIA.</p>

<p>Hill later conceded that in the early 1950&#8217;s &#8220;our technology
was pretty rudimentary&#8221;; so rudimentary in fact that in 1957 11
tons of uranium caught fire in Windscale. Serious reactor accidents
have occurred at Detroit in 1966, the Swiss heavy water reactor in
1969, and the boiling water reactors near Chicago and Wuergassen,
West Germany, in 1972 and, more recently, at Pickering Canada and
Alabama USA.</p>

<p>The managing director of British Nuclear Fuel, unperturbed by
these revelations, contemptuously called upon the Secretary of the
Environment to stop vacillating about the plans for the expansion.
Any delay, he said, might lose them the Japanese contract worth &#163;300 million.</p>

<p>In the face of mounting pressure and public revulsion against the
use of plutonium, however, Tony Benn, the Energy Minister, called for
a public inquiry into the expansion.</p>

<p>It is important to note that another inquiry is to be called to
examine the development of the fast Breeder Reactor which uses as its
fuel the plutonium waste from the old Magnox reactors but, by a freak
of nature, produces more plutonium.</p>

<p><em>The question of the reprocessing of nuclear waste to separate
plutonium must by its very nature involve the proliferation of
nuclear weapons and ensure the continued development of the Fast
Breeder Reactor and the subsequent production of more plutonium.
These crucial questions were ignored by the inquiry.</em></p>

<p>Advocates for expansion conveniently chose to ignore the fact that
the very early nuclear reactors were made with military objectives in
mind, that is, the production of plutonium and the enrichment of
uranium. These were crucial for the development of nuclear weapons,
nuclear-propelled submarines and warships.</p>

<p>The present American Light Water Reactor is based on naval reactor
development. The techniques for separation and reprocessing of
plutonium were originally developed for nuclear warheads. The policy
of nuclear energy for peaceful use &#8211; first formulated by Eisenhower
under the banner &#8220;Atoms for Peace&#8221; &#8211; was directly attributable
to advancing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The present US
President, Carter, who inherited this legacy, is today making frantic
attempts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Today the world&#8217;s nuclear reactors produce 30,000 kilograms of
plutonium annually and one-third of this is produced in 20 countries.</p>

<p>This figure will increase to 28 nations producing 45,000 kilograms
by 1985. 40% of this plutonium will be owned by the USA, USSR, France
and UK. These countries are continually refining the destructive
capabilities of these weapons, <em>the latest of which is the Neutron
bomb. This is an eight-inch nuclear artillery shell designed to
produce highly penetrating neutrons and gamma rays capable of
annihilating whole populations while leaving building intact.</em></p>

<p>This industry employs a quarter of America&#8217;s half million
scientists alone! The 1977 nuclear expenditure for the US was
$113,000 million.</p>

<p>The Windscale inquiry has revealed that, to date, 7&#189; tons of
plutonium have been recovered and as much as 45 tons will have
accumulated by the turn of the century.</p>

<p>The pro-nuclear lobby &#8211; sometimes in an hysterical and abusive
fashion &#8211; have argued that there is <em>no</em> real alternative to
nuclear energy. They have attempted to picture all opponents of
extending the nuclear energy programme as Luddites. Frank Chapple, in
his own inimitable manner, dealt with proposers of an anti-nuclear
resolution at the Labour Party conference, in this crude way.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Blackmail</h4>

<p class="fst">Sir John Hill has also not been averse to a little blackmail. Thus
he stated at the Windscale enquiry: &#8220;Unless Windscale is enlarged
and reprocessing begins immediately the spent fuel that will start to
be discharged by the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) next year will
start to corrode with corresponding leakage of radiation in less than
five years.&#8221; This Alice-in-Wonderland logic means that only by
increasing the danger of future nuclear radiation contamination by
building a re-processing plant will we be able to avoid being
contaminated now!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are many who are unfamiliar with the subject
and confused by the scientific jargon and are taken in by the nuclear
establishment&#8217;s argument. They claim: (1) There is no viable
alternative to nuclear power, (2) It will create jobs, (3) The
anti-nuclear advocates are opposed to all technology and progress. Is
there any validity in these arguments?</p>

<p>As to the question of jobs. It has been estimated that for every
&#163;2 million invested in Windscale one job will be created. In other
words, a mere 300 jobs at the cost of incalculable harm to people and
the environment. Of course, the labour movement would be opposed to
any worker losing his job. On the basis of an integrated fuel policy
it would be entirely possible to give all those employed in the fuel
industries , and more, jobs.</p>

<p>As to the alternatives. Studies to date on alternative forms of
energy have been pitifully small, while huge sums are devoted to
nuclear energy. If the cycle from uranium exploitation through mill
construction, fuel fabrication, enrichment and reprocessing of waste
material is taken into consideration, the sum involved would be
astronomical. To appreciate the extent of the money involved, the
proposed enlargement of the reprocessing plant at Windscale is put at
&#163;600 million! This compares with the miserly &#163;100,000 Britain spent
on research into wave energy last year &#8211; a drop in the ocean!</p>

<p>At the height of the oil crisis, the US National Science
Foundation rushed out a report recommending that the US commit $3,500
million to solar energy. Solar energy could provide 35% of the
nation&#8217;s heating and cooling requirements, 40% of its fuel and 30%
of its electricity.</p>

<p>Similar recommendations were made in Australia, Japan, France and
Britain. The French are already operating a 1 megawatt solar furnace
in the Pyrenees. Sweden and Denmark are so far ahead that they expect
to obtain 40% of their electricity from wind power by 1980!<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Danger</h4>

<p class="fst">Britain, however, has just allocated a mere &#163;3.4 million on
research into alternative forms of energy or the next two years. Who
can dispute the fact that, if the same resources were put into
alternative forms of energy that are at present devoted to nuclear
energy, then today we would have a viable alternative?</p>

<p>The thermo-nuclear <em>fusion</em> process (as distinct from
<em>fission</em>) which promises to provide us with all of our
requirements for thousands of years, has been languishing in a state
of malaise as the EEC, which has now just embarked on a joint project
(JET), haggled over a site.</p>

<p>The original estimate for JET of &#163;90 million rose to &#163;120
million because of the delay and inflation until today, nearly two
years after the commitment, it stands at &#163;165 million.</p>

<p>The advantages of nuclear fusion are enormous. There is no nuclear
waste, more particularly deuterium, its fuel, is present in sea water
at a concentration of 34 grammes per ton. It has been calculated that
the oceans represent a reserve of 50 million, million, tons &#8211;
enough for thousands of years of fusion.</p>

<p>This is a sharp contrast to the present nuclear fuel policy which
advocates the construction of Fast Breeder Reactors to solve our
energy needs. This policy does not appreciate the fact that a reactor
is dependent on the fuel resources of uranium as its fuel.</p>

<p>The dangers involved with plutonium have never been considered
adequately. The major problem has been its incredibly long life; it
takes millions of years to become harmless and it is impossible to
accelerate this process. <em>It has been officially classed as the
most poisonous man-made substance, the finest particle of which can
induce cancer.</em></p>

<p>The current method of disposal is in deep underground wells and is
at present costing BNFI &#163;64 million. Its link in the food chain from
marine creatures to man is already posing a health hazard.</p>

<p>An extraordinary suggestion for waste disposal has been to
separate out the plutonium and store it as a precious metal, in the
same way as you would gold and diamonds!</p>

<p>At some stage, however, the plutonium must be transported and the
number of incidents involving mishap is well documented.</p>

<p>There have been 119 transport incidents over 19 years in the USA
alone, and in 35 of them radiation was released. The US Nuclear
Commission is today investigating an accident in which 15,000lb of
uranium was spilled on a highway in Colorado. The number of shipments
of spent fuel was increased from 76 in 1971 to 1,417 in 1974 and well
over 25,000 shipments today.</p>

<p>Of course, coal and oil will continue to play, in the foreseeable
future, an important part in any fuel policy.</p>

<p>The other major problem is possible use in hijacking by
terrorists. Plutonium the size of a golf ball can devastate a city!
This has come into prominence following claims that Israeli agents
penetrated an American nuclear plant and staged four hijackings in
Europe to obtain uranium for nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>It is obvious that man cannot go on vandalising the world&#8217;s
reserves of oil, coal and gas which provide a feed stock for our
drugs, clothing and ensure the survival of future generations.</p>

<p>Further, the great quantities of carbon dioxide emitted when these
fuels are burnt has already resulted in climatic changes in all parts
of the world. If we rely solely on coal to satisfy our energy
requirements, as President Carter has just proposed for the US, then
the carbon dioxide concentration in the air could reach 4 to 8 times
its present level. This would cause a &#8216;greenhouse&#8217; effect with
the climate becoming hotter, wetter and cloudier, with the melting of
the ice cap!</p>

<p>Not only would this weather be catastrophic for crops but would
cause a shift of important agricultural regions to higher latitudes.
Evidence has already been accumulating. The sea which holds about 60
times as much carbon dioxide as there is in the air is already
showing signs that it can no longer absorb any more carbon dioxide.
Moreover, the world&#8217;s forests, which have so long been absorbing
the carbon dioxide released by burning of fuels have shrunk as demand
for timber has increased. The sulphur and heavy metal contaminants in
coal would also lead to an increase in respiratory illness and bowel cancer.</p>

<p><em>The expansion of Windscale and the construction of Fast Breeder
Reactors, far from improving our standard of living, would become a
monster of nightmarish proportions which would scar the lives of
future generations. This is inevitable on a capitalist basis.</em></p>

<p><em>A world socialist fuel and energy plan would give top priority
to renewable forms of energy like nuclear fusion, wind, solar and
waves that would save our primary fuel stocks and ensure a harmonious
relationship with our environment. Only such a coherent policy can
abolish the gloom and uncertainty which has been made possible by
insane and irrational policies.</em></p>

<p><em>Nuclear power, and particularly Fast Breeder Reactors, on the
other hand, are such a colossal danger to mankind that there is an
overwhelming case for a halt to be called to its development.</em></p>

<p><em>At the same time, the present situation shows the inevitable
chaos and anarchy in the energy field which results from an unplanned
and blind economic and social system, which is what capitalism is.</em></p>
