<br />
<p class="fst"><em>A survey published in <strong>Lancet</strong>, the medical journal, has
just revealed that up to 2 million homes in Britain put unborn
children at risk of mental retardation through lead poisoning.</em></p>

<p>Doctors at the University of Glasgow&#8217;s medical department
compared the levels of lead in the blood of 41 babies whose mental
retardation could not be attributed to any known cause with that of
36 mentally retarded babies whose cause had been diagnosed. They
found that the 41 babies had a very high concentration of lead in
their blood. The lead present was attributed to pollution of the
drinking water.</p>

<p>A great deal of evidence already exists associating lead with
hyperactivity, impaired learning and behavioural changes in both
animals and man. Children living near a lead smelter in El Paso were
found to have a low IQ, poor eyesight, sluggish movement and
difficulty in reasoning. A later survey revealed that 19 out of 20 of
the children were educationally sub-normal.</p>

<p>Lead, together with mercury, constitutes one of the most
formidable groups of environmental pollutants. Mercury is perhaps
best remembered for the large scale poisoning in 1953 of Minemata and
later Niigata in Japan. The first sign of the impending disaster that
was unleashed on these two communities was when the local cats began
to go berserk and throw themselves into the sea. People were then
seen walking in a disorientated manner, some had collapsed in the
streets suffering from convulsions and all had grotesquely dilated
pupils and paralysis of the limbs. By 1956, 78 people in the village
of Minemata were seriously ill, some had dreadful physical
deformities and 15 children were among those affected. The medical
dictionary added a new name &#8211; industrial disease or Minemata disease.</p>

<p>The cause was traced to an effluent from the Chisso factory which
flowed into Minemata bay. The effluent contained methyl mercuric
chloride which accumulated in fish which in turn was eaten by the
villagers. The mercury was used as a catalyst in one of the
industrial processes. Undeterred by the casualties including that
caused by its other factory at Niigata which left 48 dead and 150
seriously injured, the company continued to dump the mercury waste in
the sea.</p>

<p>There is an estimated 600 tons lying at the bottom of the bay.
When the government officially declared Chisso to be the cause of the
disease the company refused liability. Environmentalists then
initiated a campaign of buying large numbers of shares so that they
could change company policy.</p>

<p>In March 1976, after four major trials the company finally agreed
to pay compensation.</p>

<p>The other pollutant, lead, is today threatening to overshadow
mercury both in magnitude and with the same destructive intensity.</p>

<p>In July 1974, the Yugoslav vessel, <em>Cavecat</em>, carrying 910
barrels of tetraethyl lead (TEL) &#8211; used as an &#8216;antiknock&#8217; in
petrol &#8211; was in collision with another ship and sank off the
Italian port of Otranto in the Adriatic. Scientists immediately
warned the authorities that leakage of TEL would destroy all life in
the sea. The Adriatic would become dead; since the lead would enter
the delicate ecological life cycle and destroy the minute plankton
and plant life which in turn would destroy the fish that feed upon it
and ultimately man who eat the fish.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Warnings Ignored</h4>

<p class="fst">The authorities, as if following a general unwritten law which
governs disasters of this sort, predictably chose to ignore these
warnings. In fact the Italians and Yugoslav governments together with
the shipping company considered the recovery as being &#8220;too
expensive&#8221;. The 910 barrels containing 210 tons of TEL were doomed
to remain forever on the bed of the Adriatic sea exposed to the
corrosive action of the salt water.</p>

<p>Today, nearly three years after the accident, the Italian
government is belatedly making frantic efforts to recover the barrels
at an estimated cost of &#163;6&#189;m. Underwater photography has revealed
that many barrels were in an advanced state of corrosion. The chief
engineer in charge of recovery was pessimistic about the state of the
barrels. He feared that some had already burst. Some which were
trapped under the hull were unrecoverable.</p>

<p>These two incidents separated in terms of time and geography
demonstrate conclusively that capitalism has many common features. If
the catastrophes that occurred at Michigan and Seveso are also
considered then the enormity of the crime committed becomes even more
unpalatable. (In Seveso clouds of very toxic dioxin gas were
released. In Michigan polybrominated biphenyl was fed to cattle.)</p>

<p>In all these incidents there was a significant lull in time before
adequate safety precautions were taken. This was criminal, especially
as in the case of Seveso where the management already had experience
in dealing with that type of accident. In all the cases the managing
director, together with the public health officers, publicly
proclaimed that there was no danger involved. They even went to the
extent of producing scientific evidence to show that the people were
not suffering from the symptoms that they complained of. Nine months
after Seveso the incidence of skin cancer has not abated. All the
babies conceived in that period have been aborted.</p>

<p>Four years after Michigan some nine million people have
significant amounts of PBB which is known to cause genetic diseases.
Thousands are already experiencing deformity in their hands and feet.
In Britain today every man, woman and child contains levels of lead
and mercury which is well above that of Europe.</p>

<p>It is no coincidence that the report in <strong>Lancet</strong> involves
Scotland. Scottish drinking water contains 27% more lead than the
World Health Organisation&#8217;s limit. As this report indicates studies
are only now being made on the additive effects of lead and mercury
on the human body. It is already known for example that lead
interferes with all the metabolic processes in the body. This is
precisely why this report should not go unnoticed. Science today
dominates and permeates every aspect of our existence. It dictates
and influences for example the choice of food, clothes, transport and
even our life span.</p>

<p>The question of pollution is of immediate concern because
capitalism is only motivated by one thing &#8211; profits. They are
prepared to destroy and disfigure our environment, kill and maim the
whole population to achieve this objective, as we have seen.</p>

<p>A planned socialist society which has control of the means of
production, distribution and disposal of toxic material will ensure
adequate safety precautions of the work force and the population as a
whole. For instance, the quantity of lead added to petrol which in
turn is emitted to the atmosphere will be drastically reduced and
less harmful alternatives sought. We will not be catapulted into
situations in which whole populations contract cancerous and genetic
diseases, where young children and new born babies are intellectually
disadvantaged for the remainder of their lives.</p>
