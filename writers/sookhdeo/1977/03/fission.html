Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Comrade Wylie&#8217;s letter on nuclear technology [<strong>Militant</strong>,
No.&nbsp;344] raises a number of questions, especially his assertion
that opposition to nuclear technology is indefensible and
incompatible with the aims of socialism. I refute this and would like
to reply to his and Alan Ashworth&#8217;s arguments in last week&#8217;s
issue of the <strong>Militant</strong>.</em></p>

<p>We in the labour movement have never opposed the tremendous
achievements that science has contributed and can give to mankind,
for if we did it would be to turn the clock backwards. What we do
question is the insane and irrational way in which science is being
used under capitalism. This has led for example to disasters like the
mercury poisoning at Minemata in Japan, the creation of dust bowls in
America and latterly the explosion at Seveso that has poisoned
thousands of people and permanently destroyed large areas of land.</p>

<p>Catastrophes like these are inevitable unless a socialist planned
economy is adopted. Under a sane system a fuel policy will be
implemented which may give a priority to nuclear technology, or to be
more precise, a safe form of thermo-nuclear fusion and forms of
energy that are not dependent on the earth&#8217;s resources and which
are free from pollution.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Fusion Safer</h4>

<p class="fst">Consider nuclear fusion. In this process deuterium (or &#8220;heavy
water&#8221;, an isotope of hydrogen) nuclei can be made to fuse together
and in so doing liberate energy. The advantages of this process is
that no nuclear waste is produced and more importantly deuterium is
present in sea water at a concentration of 34gm. per ton.</p>

<p>It has been calculated that the oceans represent a reserve of 50
million million tons of deuterium or in other words enough for many
thousands of millions of years of fusion. If the technical
difficulties could be solved (for example maintaining the very high
temperature needed for fusion) this would represent a viable form of energy.</p>

<p>This is in sharp contrast to the present nuclear fuel policy which
advocates the construction of 50 Fast Breeder reactors by the year
2000. This policy does not appreciate the fact that a reactor is
dependent on the finite quantities of uranium as its fuel. <em>It has
never considered the dangers involved in handling, transport, storage
and ultimately disposal of Plutonium a substance classified as the
most toxic ever synthesised by man. Plutonium will remain toxic for
the next 2,400 years and there are no methods for accelerating the
decay process.</em></p>

<p>The two methods of disposal have both led to controversies. The
first is burial in deep underground mines and introduces the fear of
damage by future earthquakes and the annihilation of whole cities.
The alternative method of disposal is by rocketing it into outer
space and which will saddle future generations with enormous problems.</p>

<p>Consider the economics of the present policy. A recent OECD report
concludes that the present uranium reserves correspond to only 15
years forward requirement and unless there would be a severe shortage
which would disrupt the nuclear programme.</p>

<p>The situation concerning uranium will be exactly analogous with
that of oil in the year 2000. It has been estimated that upwards of
four million tons of uranium would be needed by that year and
possibly ten million tons of uranium would be needed by that year and
possibly ten million tons by the year 2025. The report neglects to
mention what such an exploration, together with mining and mill
construction would cost.</p>

<p>If the cycle from exploration through enrichment and fuel
fabrication to the reprocessing of the irradiated fuel is taken into
consideration the sum involved would be astronomical. To appreciate
the extent of the sum involved, the proposed enlargement of the
reprocessing plant at Windscale is estimated at &#163;600 million! This
compares with the miserly &#163;100,000 Britain spent last year on
research and development from waves &#8211; a drop in the ocean!</p>

<p>The arguments against nuclear fission are not academic but are
based on the harsh realities. It is short sighted to dismiss the
fears about the lasting effect of nuclear waste. Comrade Ashworth
speculates that &#8220;it is quite possible that most of the problems of
waste re-cycling can be overcome.&#8221; The fact is that in the here and
now those problems have not been solved. Scientists cannot overcome
the problems of obtaining uranium and disposal of its fission product plutonium.</p>

<p>It is entirely erroneous to compare the dangers in coal mining or
the gas or the North Sea oil extraction industry with that in nuclear
fission. The potential dangers from nuclear fission are much greater.
Coal extraction is a danger to the workers in the industry and can be
eliminated by technology. Arthur Scargill envisages the time when the
digging of coal is done by mechanical means and there are no miners
underground. But today the population at large does not face terrible
dangers from coal extraction.</p>

<p>Yet the inherent dangers in the disposal of nuclear waste can
result in catastrophe in the future. There is no safe way that it can
be disposed of. The dangers are highlighted by the concession made to
the nuclear lobby that nuclear plants should be situated away from
large population centres!</p>

<p><em>Moreover there is conclusive evidence linking all radioactive
materials with cancer. Documented cases of &#8216;atomic disease&#8217; can
be traced to the miners in Chile in the 19th century. In 1924 the
medical world were astonished when reports reached them of the
terrible story of the radium girls of Ottawa, Jersey. These girls
painted luminous watch dials and in order to achieve a finer point
would gently suck the tips of the brushes. The radioactivity of the
radium ate away their mouths, teeth and jaws. To discuss the
horrifying effects of the bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki would entail an article on its own.</em></p>

<p>Since cancer is a long agonising process the full extent of
radiation damage caused by plutonium is unlikely to be known in a
couple of years.</p>

<p>Comrade Ashworth argues that because Britain&#8217;s nuclear industry
is controlled by the State the dangers which other countries face &#8211;
West Germany for instance &#8211; don&#8217;t exist here. This is
unfortunately not the case. The nationalised industries in Britain
serve the private industries and use the same criteria. It is no
accident that the <strong>Financial Times</strong> is to the fore in demanding
the building of Fast Breeder Reactors. Moreover many instances can be
given to show that the mandarins at the top of the nationalised
industries behave as irresponsibly as their counterparts in private
industry with regard to safety of the workers in the industry and the
population at large.</p>

<p>Of course the workers in the nuclear power industry will object to
the programme being stopped unless an alternative is given. Lucas
shop stewards have put forward proposals for their industry &#8211; and
their jobs &#8211; to be switched away from providing weapons to peaceful
purposes. The jobs of the workers in the nuclear industry can be
guaranteed through a sane and safe socialist fuel policy.</p>

<p><em>It is wrong from a socialist standpoint to seek to justify
nuclear fission and minimise the terrible dangers arising from it.
Far from being a progressive factor, it can, and will, in the hands
of irresponsible profiteers, create extra difficulties for us and
future generations.</em></p>
