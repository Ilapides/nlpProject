<p class="fst"><em>The explosion that occurred at the Swiss-owned Icmesa plant in
Seveso in Northern Italy on Saturday 10th July was no ordinary
explosion. For it released into the atmosphere one of the most toxic
chemicals ever developed by man, the deadly dioxin for which no
antidote exists.</em></p>

<p>Within days of the explosion rashes begin to appear on the skins
of babies and small children followed by acute diarrhoea and intense
vomiting. People began suffering from headaches, violent sweating and
experiencing pains in the kidneys and liver. Two weeks later two
women died; and the whole area was sealed off and the population
evacuated. When an ultimate check of the bodies, deformed babies and
diseases is made, perhaps someone will ask the question, &#8220;why is
dioxin made at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>This horrific incident, sounding as if it were taken directly out
of the pages of a science fiction story, is not only indicative of
the blatant disregard of the environment by huge profit-conscious
monopolies but also if left unchecked threatens the ultimate
destruction of man.</p>

<p><em>The same could be said of science as a whole. Seveso is only
the latest example of the perversion of science and technique by
capitalist society. Where profit is the prime motive catastrophes
like Seveso are inevitable.</em></p>

<p>Dioxin is produced during the synthesis of tricholorophenol. This
is used in the manufacture of two chemicals. One of the chemicals, a
bactericide, was used as a wash for treating acne, in soaps, surgical
swabs, and as antiseptic in hospital nurseries. But in the late
1960s, evidence began to accumulate linking its use with internal and
brain damage. Its use was immediately phased out throughout the world.</p>

<p>The other chemical is a herbicide of the type used by US
imperialism to defoliate huge areas of Vietnam. According to a recent
scientific survey, growth of vegetation in areas where it was used is
unlikely to occur for several decades. A report by the National
Academy of Sciences has revealed that 6 million pounds of herbicide
was made by the US in 1974. The US Environmental Protection Agency is
now reconsidering its use.</p>

<p>This is not the only accident involving dioxin that this Swiss
company has experienced. There have been accidents in the US,
Britain, W. Germany and Holland, and in all these accidents the whole
plant had to be destroyed and buried in deep underground mines! The
first accident occurred in Hidwigohifer in W. Germany in 1953 and
affected 55 men. In the British accident at the Coalite factory in
Bolsover in April 1968, 79 men were affected.</p>

<p>The calamitous mishap at Seveso has sent shock waves reverberating
throughout these countries. Now eight years after the accident at the
coalite factory the company has decided to investigate what effect
the dumped contaminated plant has on the local population. But they
never revealed publicly, only in confidence to the County Council&#8217;s
Planning Committee Chairman, the exact location of the buried plant.
It is thought to be buried in an old mine West of the village of Morton.</p>

<p><em>The destruction of the environment &#8211; which has now reached
calamitous proportions &#8211; is inevitable in a society where the blind
forces of the market and the anarchy that goes with it
predominates.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">In the early decades in the 19th century many children in
industrial cities suffered and died from rickets, a disease
associated with the lack of Vitamin D. This was principally caused by
a thick pall of smoke which hung permanently above industrial areas
obscuring the sun and preventing the ultra violet rays in the
sunlight from reaching the skin where it is able to synthesise the
vitamin D essential to the body. Fifty years on, the situation is
exactly reversed. This can be attributed to the multimillion dollar
fluorocarbon industry. It has been demonstrated that due to the
increased use of chlorofluorocarbon as a propellant in aerosol
sprays, this has a destructive effect on the ozone layer in the
earth&#8217;s stratosphere and the subsequent increase in the ultra
violet light. An immediate effect of this is to increase the
incidence of skin cancer. The US National Academy of Sciences
concludes in a report that a 1% decrease of stratospheric ozone will
cause a 2% increase in skin cancer.</p>

<p>Ironically, fluorocarbons started life in the late 1940s as a
refrigerant, possessing qualities of non flammability, non toxicity
and stability. With the development of the low pressure valve in 1947
the way was opened for aerosol preparations and the first was the
hair spray in 1950. In that year 30 million were sold in the US. In
1960, 4,400 million and in 1973, 2.9 thousand million in the US
alone! When these chlorofluorocarbons are released they rise into the
stratosphere where they destroy the protective ozone layer.</p>

<p>Measures have to be demanded by the labour movement to prevent the
occurrence of more Sevesos, to press for the elimination of the
destruction of the ozone layer etc. But as each crime of the
monopolies is discovered and eliminated others will go undetected
until some future calamitous development occurs.</p>

<p><em>Therefore the only ultimate solution is to take the use of
science and technique out of the hands of a handful of profiteers and
make it accountable to and controlled by a harmonious socialist
society will it be possible to really harness science as a mighty
lever for benefitting man and his environment instead of destroying
him as is the situation now.</em></p>
