<br />
<p class="fst"><strong>THE recent Royal Commission report about the damaging effects
of lead heralds a major advance in the struggle to eliminate one of
the most toxic substances from our environment.</strong></p>

<p>The definitive report, the product of a year-long study, makes
twenty-nine recommendations for the immediate removal of lead from
petrol and the phased reduction of lead from paints, water, food and drink:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The average blood lead concentration in the population
is about a quarter of that at which symptoms of frank chronic lead
poisoning may occasionally occur. We find this disturbing! We do not
know of any other toxic substance which is so widely distributed in
human and animal populations and present at concentrations greater
than one fifth at which frank symptoms may occur.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Apart from condemning lead the report also dismisses as being of
dubious value, the concept of threshold levels; - these are widely
used by industry as a measure of how much toxic substance someone can
be exposed to, without harmful effects. The report also calls for the
replacement of all lead plumbing and suggests mass publicity of
hazards associated with paint stripping!</p>

<p>Predictably, many industries, more noticeably the motor
manufacturers, have attempted to discredit the major findings. Some
have retaliated by questioning the evidence of harmful effects and
also asserting that the costs of lead removal from petrol would be
prohibitively high. The motor industry has even claimed that an
investment of &#163;2,000 million would be required for new machinery.</p>

<p>What is the present situation regarding lead in petrol? In
Britain, over 50,000 tons of lead are discharged into the atmosphere
each year &#8211; 10,000 tons in London alone! The effects of the
colossal damage of urban lead poisoning are well documented but those
who profit from its continued use in petrol are loathe to meet its replacement.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Don&#8217;t rely on government &#8216;good intentions&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">In 1980, after a series of legal battles, public concern and trade
union pressure forced the government to mount an enquiry. They
subsequently agreed to implement a new limit of 0.15g of lead per
litre by the end of 1985, compared with the old limit of 0.4 grammes.</p>

<p>The Tory government at that time claimed: &#8220;Time was needed for
industry to make adjustments to machinery and to keep in line with
Europe.&#8221; Not surprisingly industry did not feel threatened by those proposals!</p>

<p>Now government grudgingly says it &#8220;accepts&#8221; the findings of
the latest Royal Commission report. But it is vital that the labour
movement does not rely on Tory &#8216;promises of intent&#8217;, and bases
its approach on a clear analysis of the dangers lead poses, the
alternatives, and the vested interests arguing against change.</p>

<p>Firstly what are the dangers? A great deal of evidence exists
associating lead with hyper-activity, impaired learning and
behavioural changes in both animals and man. An early study of
children living near a lead smelter in El Paso found that many had
low IQs, poor eye sight, sluggish behaviour and difficulty in reasoning.</p>

<p>A later survey of the same children found that a staggering 19 out
of 20 were educationally sub normal. More recent studies of the shed
milk teeth of urban children in Britain and the US have conclusively
established the link with lead in the air.</p>

<p>These finding have startling implications. Recent random analysis
of the teeth of children in Birmingham have shown a very high lead
content. It has been estimated that as many as 95% of the two million
children in Birmingham are affected!</p>

<p>Russia has outlawed lead in petrol since 1959, and Japan, USA, W.
Germany and Sweden have either followed suit or begun to move in that direction.</p>

<p>Why is lead added to petrol? It was discovered that tetra ethyl
lead (TEL) could be used for increasing the octane rating of petrol
to make it more suitable for use with high-compression car engines
and also prevent &#8216;knocking&#8217;. The higher the octane rating, the
easier the combustion and less the &#8216;knocking&#8217;.</p>

<p>It is also convenient and cheaper to the oil companies because it
can be used to adjust the octane rating to produce various grades of
petrol which requires less refining.</p>

<p>Over the years several non-toxic substitutes for lead were found &#8211;
the most satisfactory being methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). MTBE
has been described as the perfect alternative to lead. It is cheap to
manufacture, non poisonous, causes no engine damage and promotes more
complete combustion of fuel and importantly, does not produce any
harmful products.</p>

<p>But within months of its manufacture, the oil companies and car
companies launched a virulent campaign, firstly to persuade the
government against its use, and secondly to disseminate misleading
information to the population as a whole. The oil companies have also
asserted that to produce lead-free petrol would require maximum
investment in new refinery techniques which would increase the
consumption of oil and the price of petrol.</p>

<p>These claims are absolute nonsense. The oil companies have made
colossal profits as a result of the first wave of oil price rises.
Yet a fraction of these profits could produce petrol free of lead.</p>

<p>Moreover, because of the recession all their refining plants have
been running at below 50% capacity. A recent conference of scientists
has suggested that only slight modification of existing equipment
could produce the required higher octane petrol, free of lead.</p>

<p>Where the health of workers and their families are concerned,
there is no safe lead level at all. The labour and trade union
movement must take up the issue and fight against lead additives in
petrol.</p>

<p>Labour must demand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regular monitoring of lead in air and regular examination
of all children for lead poisoning.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Abolition of all lead additives in fuels.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Outlawing of dumping of lead and other heavy metals by
industry.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Grants for lead piping to be removed from all homes.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Legislation to forbid the presence of any concentration of
lead in food and drink.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Abolition of threshold levels and the recognition that all
doses of lead are harmful.</li>
</ul>
