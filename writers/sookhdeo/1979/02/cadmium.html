<br />
<p class="fst"><strong>Over 1,000 villagers in Shipham, Somerset, are said to be at
risk due to abnormally high concentrations of cadmium in the soil.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This has again catapulted the controversial issue of toxic
heavy metal contaminants into national prominence.</strong></p>
<p>Coinciding with the announcement that the incidence of cancer has
risen dramatically and is industrially related; the news has provoked
a public outcry and a call for much more stringent safety monitoring
techniques.</p>
<p>The toxic heavy metals, lead, mercury, and cadmium, constitute one
of the most formidable groups of environmental pollutants. The
dangers from mercury and cadmium have already been tragically
underlined by the poisoning of entire communities.</p>
<p>The most recent studies of lead, by doctors at the University of
Glasgow&#8217;s medical department found that it caused mental
retardation in newly born infants.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Grotesque</h4>
<p class="fst">A great deal of evidence already exists associating lead with poor
eyesight, sluggish movement and difficulty in reasoning amongst
children.</p>
<p>A survey of children living near a lead smelter in El Paso found
that eleven out of twenty of the children were educationally
subnormal.</p>
<p>Minamata disease, attributed to mercury poisoning, was first
observed when people were seen walking in a disorientated manner,
some suffering from convulsions, and all with grotesquely dilated
pupils and paralysis of the limbs.</p>
<p>By 1956, seventy-eight people were seriously ill, many with
appalling physical deformities.</p>
<p>The cause was traced to an effluent from the Chisso factory
containing methyl mercuric chloride which flowed into the sea and
accumulated in fish eaten by the villagers.</p>
<p>Another disease, attributed to cadmium, occurred in northern
Japan. The area is rich in cadmium and zinc, and zinc smelting is the
main industry.</p>
<p>The disease was first described by Japanese orthopaedic surgeons:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The disease takes a long course of increasing
painfulness which, beginning with simple symptoms such as lumbago,
ends with total and agonised immobility as the result of skeletal
collapse.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The cadmium is absorbed into the bones, leading to the eventual
breakdown of the skeleton. When a Birmingham platemaker, Mr Leslie
Day, died from the disease, the inquest was told that Mr Day <em>shrank</em>
seven inches, lost his sense of smell and became disfigured.</p>
<p>Cadmium has the unique property of accumulating in the kidneys.
Apart from causing kidney damage, it can combine in enzymes in the
body to form highly toxic complexes which have cancer-inducing
properties.</p>
<p>A good deal of evidence (from Sweden and the USA) exists linking
it with heart disease and high blood pressure. In fact, exposure to
the <em>smallest</em> concentration of cadmium can produce any one of
these afflictions.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation, has attempted to impose standards
in food and drink. Recognising that contamination will increase in
future, it has urged governments to adopt a rational policy of waste
disposal.</p>
<p>Workers should take note of the current situation and be prepared
to protest to the Minister of the Environment on behalf of the
residents of Shipham. The Department of Health claim that it would
take many decades of exposure to the toxic metal even at the levels
reported &#8211; (100 times the level recommended by scientists) &#8211; to
cause illness.</p>
<p>The question of pollution is of immediate concern because
capitalism is only motivated by one thing &#8211; profits.</p>
<p>They are prepared to destroy and disfigure our environment, kill
and maim whole sections of the population to achieve their
objectives, as events have shown.</p>
<p>A planned socialist society controlling the means of production,
distribution and disposal of toxic materials will ensure adequate
safety precautions for the workforce and the population as a whole.</p>
