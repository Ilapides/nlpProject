<p class="fst">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about nuclear power but no power in the
world is worth my baby&#8217;s life.&#8221; This was the tragic comment of a
pregnant woman in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the scene of the world&#8217;s
worst nuclear accident.</p>
<p>On March 28th, the nuclear reactor at &#8216;Three Mile Island&#8217;
plant went irreversibly out of control. Only a miracle prevented the
annihilation of 160,000 inhabitants within ten miles of the reactor.</p>
<p>The cause of the accident was the failure of one of the
much-heralded failsafe valves on the huge cooling tower. Within
minutes, thousands of gallons of water which normally conducted heat
away from the reactor core became cracked and overheated.</p>
<p>The resulting reaction produced hydrogen gas which exploded and
spewed a deadly mixture of radioactive steam, gases and iodine into
the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So serious was the accident that the US Nuclear Regulatory
Commission warned of the possibility of a melt-down. This was the
worst possible accident a reactor can suffer.</p>
<p>Scientists have calculated that in such an accident over 3,000
people would die immediately; 45,000 suffer appalling injuries and a
further 45,000 die of cancer within ten years, assuming that they
live in a sparsely populated area.</p>
<p>The authorities, already under tremendous pressure following
adverse publicity on the disposal of nuclear waste, and reports
showing that the lowest radiation can cause cancer, have issued
reassurances that the radiation emitted is no more than you would get
at the dentists.</p>
<p>But what is the truth? A mountain of evidence has been recently
published linking extremely low dosages of radiation with increases
in cancer deaths. Horrifying statistics have come from America.</p>
<p>Studies of death certificates of workers at the Hansford Nuclear
plant in Washington have revealed a disturbing high incidence of
cancer of the pancreas and leukaemia, even though workers were
exposed to levels of radiation well within agreed safety limits of 5
rems per year.</p>
<p>But the most alarming results have come from a chance discovery.
The overall cancer death rate among civilian nuclear workers at the
Navy&#8217;s Portsmouth Shipyard in Kittery, Maine was more than twice
the national average, and well above that of the yard&#8217;s non-nuclear
workers.</p>
<p>These figures were calculated by a doctor who had filed a law suit
under the Freedom of Information Act to get access to records.</p>
<p>The navy had good reason for maintaining an iron hold over these
records. The results were startling. They showed that the rate of
leukaemia was an incredible 450% higher than the general
population&#8217;s. The incidence of lymph gland cancer was 125% higher.
And the workers were only exposed to an astonishingly low one rem of
radiation per year.</p>
<p>These studies have conclusively demonstrated that there is no safe
level of radiation exposure. Moreover the iodine which was also
emitted causes even more serious abnormalities.</p>
<p>For iodine is absorbed into the thyroid gland, which control&#8217;s
the body&#8217;s metabolism. In recent accidents, farmers had to destroy
their milk for many months. The authorities already conscious of this
have issued similar instructions to farmers.</p>
<p>In the light of the Harrisburg incident, the whole nuclear
programme has been questioned.</p>
<p>Can nuclear power be made safe? Are there alternative forms of
energy capable of replacing nuclear fission? One thing is: the
capitalists, who are only interested in profits not safety or life,
cannot be allowed to make these decisions.</p>
<p>I believe that safe, viable alternatives to nuclear fission can be
established. But the labour movement must conduct its own
thoroughgoing enquiry to answer these questions.</p>
<p>In the meantime it is vital that the labour movement mobilises to
ensure that as far as possible health and safety become a key issue
in all nuclear establishments.</p>
