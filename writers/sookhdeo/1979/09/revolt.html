<p class="fst"><em>The Caribbean has become a cauldron of revolt.</em></p>
<p><em>The recent revolution in Grenada has sent reverberations
throughout the entire region and detonated social and political
upheavals in the islands of Dominica and Antigua during the summer.</em></p>
<p>Earlier this year the US Secretary of State was forced to concede
that &#8220;There was not a single island in the Caribbean that could not
go the same way as Grenada within five years&#8221;. (<strong>Financial Times</strong>,
25/4/78)</p>
<p>Such is the chronic nature of their economies, the poverty and
wretchedness of the mass of the people that it was impossible to
contain the virus of revolution.</p>
<p>These poverty-stricken islands reeling like punch crazed boxers
from one economic blow after another, have just been dealt a further
cruel blow by nature.</p>
<p>Hurricane David wreaked havoc throughout the islands earlier this
month. In Dominica it killed thousands and made a further 60,000
homeless (out of a population of only 90,000). It also caused
millions of pounds worth of damage destroying the principal foreign
exchange earners &#8211; sugar cane and bananas.</p>
<p>The economies on many of the islands are already devastated
through paying for the huge oil increases and manufactured goods and
industrial equipment &#8211; it is now so parlous that their only source
of foreign exchange are the remittances from relatives living
abroad.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Single crop economies</h4>
<p class="fst">Unemployment in the Caribbean is estimated at a staggering 60%.
And with over half the population under the age of 25 and
restrictions on emigration to Britain and the US, the islanders are
condemned to a desperate existence.</p>
<p>Many just manage to eke out a living by scouring the countryside
for vegetables or by fishing. Many households are without such basic
amenities as drinking water or sanitation.</p>
<p>The price of sugar which has risen spectacularly in the early
1970s and promised to go some way towards solving their economic
problems has now collapsed. This was due in part to poor weather and
the insane policies of the major capitalist countries.</p>
<p>In particular, the Common Market countries have recently taken
measures which have had an enormously adverse effect on cane sugar
production in the Caribbean and other undeveloped areas of the world.
They subsidised their beet sugar producers to the tune of £600m in
the past season to dump their supplies on the world market.</p>
<p>This cuts the share of the market of the cane producers and at the
same time depresses the price of sugar which has had a catastrophic
effect on the cane producing countries.</p>
<p>This policy has resulted in sugar process being well below the
cost of production over the past 3 years! Moreover, cane sugar
imports into Britain have been dramatically cut following entry into
the Common Market.</p>
<p>For many islands the final blow was struck last year when the
banana harvest failed due to a combination of natural disasters and a
glut on the world market.</p>
<p>For example in Dominica, banana production fell just under a third
for each of the last 2 years!</p>
<p>In St Vincent (with a population of 120,000) the volcano which has
been rumbling intermittently and belching hot lava over the island,
completely destroyed the banana crop &#8211; estimated at over £4m.</p>
<p>The banana industry in both islands was the single largest
employer.</p>
<p>Tourism, another pillar of the economy has only exacerbated their
problems as the industry achieved early successes and then collapsed.</p>
<p>In St Lucia tourism climbed from 50,000 in 1969 to a peak of
200,000 in 1978. In 1977 tourism earned the islands £7m. With these
funds the government commissioned new hotels and facilities plus a
planned industrial free zone area.</p>
<p>The increased fuel costs, and the changed situation
internationally have virtually stopped the tourist trade.</p>
<p>In 1977 the government turned for help to multi-national
capitalism. It gave permission for the US-based Amerada-Hess Oil
Corporation to build a $135m oil refinery. The company demanded
conditions of course. Its main demand was a government bill affirming
no interference or possibility of nationalisation.</p>
<p>But last month under enormous pressure from the masses the old
conservative government was thrown out in elections. And the new
radical government has pledged to re-examine this bill.</p>
<p><em>Antigua and Dominica also highlight the explosive social and
political processes now unfolding.</em></p>
<p>These two impoverished islands have a history of the government
using the veneer of constitutionality in order to mask widespread
corruption and repression.</p>
<p>Both governments are now desperately attempting to curb the
upsurge of radicalism and defuse the growing social dynamite.</p>
<p>In the last 3 months the islands have been paralysed by waves of
strikes &#8211; involving every section of workers &#8211; struggling to
improve living standards.</p>
<p>In Antigua, instead of getting to grips with the fundamental
problems of his island, the Prime Minister and his deputy (his son),
have blamed the strikes on his predecessor who had been found guilty
of corruption &#8211; and on communists. The regime has been attacked by
workers because of its internal repression and also its gangster
policies of acting as a staging post for arms to the South African
and Rhodesian regimes.</p>
<p><em>Dominica was the scene of a titanic struggle against the
repressive policies of Prime Minister Patrick John. In attempting to
rush through parliament legislation banning strikes and curtailing
the freedom of the press, he united at a strike the opposition
parties and the trade unions.</em></p>
<p><em>A general strike paralysed the island and John was compelled to
resign.</em></p>
<p><em>It had come to a head with the shooting of demonstrators and
the revelations in the foreign press of his links with gangsters and
the South African regime. Bizarre plots were also revealed which
contained all the ingredients of a spy plot &#8211; the mafia,
assassination attempts, foreign mercenaries &#8211; were all implicated.</em></p>
<p>There is no way that capitalism can solve the problems of the
area. The only way out is a decisive break with world capitalism and
the establishment of a socialist federation.</p>
