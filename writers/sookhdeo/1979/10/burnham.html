<p class="fst"><strong>&#8216;Burnham must go&#8217;. This was the slogan last month as the
many thousands of Guyanese workers and youth defied the police and
hired thugs to protest at the government&#8217;s criminal economic
policies and increased repression.</strong></p>
<p>Strikes, demonstrations, and a national disobedience campaign has
brought this tiny country in South America to a standstill and,
importantly, united for the first time the Indian sugar and bauxite
workers.</p>
<p>In the last two weeks the capital, Georgetown, has been the scene
of bitter and ugly fighting. The offices of the PNC were fire-bombed,
together with several government buildings and the dreaded House of
Israel headquarters.</p>
<p>The House of Israel &#8211; a pseudo-religious group led by &#8216;Rabbi
Washington&#8217; and better known as David Hill, a wanted American
criminal &#8211; have already murdered a British Jesuit priest
photographing a demonstration and attacked members of the opposition
with impunity.</p>
<p>Hill has openly boasted of his close links with the government and
of his assistance in crushing the 135-day sugar workers&#8217; strike
last year.</p>
<p>The House of Israel and the infamous Jonestown community have been
deliberately cultivated by the Burnham government to work as scabs
and perform the other obnoxious tasks essential for his survival.</p>
<p>Another, more ominous development has been in the increasing
dissatisfaction of the army over their role and the dismissal of
their commander.</p>
<p>This came to a head when they were asked to swear allegiance to
the ruling PNC and to Birnham personally. The commander &#8211; Brigadier
Clarence Price &#8211; had earlier warned the government they were not
prepared to work as strike-breakers.</p>
<p>He and his two deputies were immediately replaced with members of
Burnham&#8217;s family. A further 33 officers have since submitted their
resignations.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed reports in the last week have claimed that the army
has given Burnham just one month to resign.</p>
<p>The crises were serious enough for Burnham to cancel his planned
attendance at the Commonwealth Conference in Lusaka.</p>
<p>Burnham has since condemned the opposition as
counter-revolutionaries out to destroy his &#8220;socialist gains&#8221;. He
had even compared the present plight of Guyana as being similar to
revolutionary Russia in 1917 under attack from counter-revolution.</p>
<p>Calling his policies &#8216;Burnhamist-Leninist&#8217; the former stooge
of US imperialism, Burnham, has described his party at various times
as Marxist-Christian and Co-Operative-Socialist.</p>
<p>He has resorted to demagogic slogans in order to mask his
reactionary policies.</p>
<p>At no time has Burnham attempted to get to grips with the
fundamental problems.</p>
<p>The discontent within the sugar industry &#8211; the country&#8217;s
largest foreign exchange earner, highlights the dangers of not
implementing socialist policies.</p>
<p>Burnham first granted and then rejected a £50 million
profit-sharing scheme which would have brought the sugar workers &#8211;
who are mainly of Indian origins to that of their counter-parts in
the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Their dissatisfaction is indicated by the levels of strikes
between 1973&#8211;76: there were 416 strikes with the loss of 1,424,000
man days.</p>
<p>The government reacted viciously by drafting in 6,000
strike-breakers, seizing the strike funds and food parcels. The
strike lasted 20 weeks and cost the government $200 million.</p>
<p>The government, desperate for aid for an economy already
bankrupted through paying for the huge oil increases and foreign
goods, negotiated from the IMF, the World Bank, W. Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>The repayment on these loans is now higher than the new loans at
present being sought.</p>
<p>When the crisis of capitalism in the period 1973&#8211;75 destroyed
the fragile basis of the economy, Burnham was compelled by the
pressure of the masses to nationalise the foreign owners bauxite and
sugar monopolies: 80% of the economy is now in the hands of the
government.</p>
<p>But the racial divisions and the absence of a clear Marxist
leadership capable of cementing unity amongst the Negro and Indian
masses, together with the absence of workers&#8217; democracy and a plan
of production has resulted in chaos in the country.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Economy tied to world prices</h4>
<p class="fst">The country&#8217;s principal foreign exchange earners &#8211; sugar and
bauxite have both declined dramatically due to a combination of
strikes, mismanagement, adverse weather conditions and a slump on the
world market.</p>
<p>For the second year running the government has had to scale down
their sugar targets from 360,000 tons to 300,000 tons.</p>
<p>Similarly, bauxite production is expected to decline by 18%
reducing the target from 1.14 million tons to 950,000 tons.</p>
<p>The 27% drop in bauxite production was responsible for the massive
foreign exchange deficit of £50m.</p>
<p>The IMF continues to exert a stranglehold over the economy. The
government was compelled to carry through savage cuts to public
expenditure and to adopt deflationary policies in order to curb the
spiralling inflation.</p>
<p>As a consequence, unemployment has rocketed to over 50% with a
further 30% underemployed. In the last year over 4,000 people have been dismissed from the public services whilst a further 15,000 young
school leavers join the job market each year.</p>
<p>Also, serious food shortages and escalating price increases on
basic food stuffs have precipitated a wave of violence throughout the
country.</p>
<p>These events have demonstrated on the one side that capitalism is
incapable of showing a way forward in a backward country like Guyana.
The pressure of the situation compelled Burnham to declare himself a
&#8216;Marxist&#8217;.</p>
<p>But without a programme capable of cementing unity between the
masses, turmoil and instability is inevitable.</p>
<p>Only a genuine workers&#8217; state with complete nationalisation of
the remaining big firms can eliminate the wanton bureaucracy and
chaos that is at present stultifying the economy.</p>
<p>A plan of production of workers and small farmers councils,
management of the economy, right of recall with regular rotation and
controlled wage differentials will not only abolish the racial
divisions but provide the basis for better living standards, acting
as a beacon for the establishment of a Socialist Federation of the
West Indies.</p>
