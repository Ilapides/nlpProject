<p class="quoteb"><strong>&#8220;THE RELEASE of mind-bending drugs such as LSD in
the drinking water of enemy forces could facilitate a peaceful US
take-over.</strong></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The spraying of a pacifying gas will reduce opposing
troops into fits of helpless laughter.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;An epidemic that will weaken and debilitate entire populations.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">These are just a few of the more bizarre examples from <strong>No fire
&#8211; no thunder</strong>. The book, which includes reference sources and
tables provides a rare glimpse into the nightmare world of chemical
and biological warfare. The race to perfect the most horrendous
weapons has now taken on fantastic dimensions that border on science fiction.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Deadly disease</h4>

<p class="fst">Bombs filled with deadly disease, the release of millions of
yellow-fever carrying mosquitos, chemicals that can irreversibly
alter the environment, incapacitate, kill and mutilate on a massive
scale, are all being developed and even tested.</p>

<p>The book correctly opposes the grotesque wastage of resources &#8211;
$8 billion is predicted over the next 3 years in America alone.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>New techniques</h4>

<p class="fst">All the major advances in science, especially new techniques in
genetic engineering that could be used to eradicate hunger, disease
and the terrible misery that afflicts the vast majority of humanity
are instead being used to produce weapons for mass destruction. The
book also accurately maps the history and use of these weapons and
examines their relationship with international law.</p>

<p>It documents all the cases of abuse of such agreements as the 1925
Geneva Protocol and the 1972 Biological Weapons convention. Singled
out for special treatment are the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in
1935&#8211;36 and Japan&#8217;s attack on China in 1938.</p>

<p>In both cases, vast quantities of deadly phosgene, mustard and
tear gases were sprayed indiscriminately, and resulted in enormous
casualties. In more recent times US forces released some 17 million
tons of deadly weedkillers and an assortment of chemicals over
Vietnam which not only devastated the country&#8217;s forests but
inflicted appalling injuries.</p>

<p>These breaches of various agreements and many more are attributed
though, either to imprecise wordings and definitions or to the method
of classification of toxic substances. The book also claims that it
is precisely the strength of international law and specific
conventions which has prevented these weapons being used on a huge
scale and thus preserving the peace.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>War-free zone</h4>

<p class="fst">The authors urge all nations to sign a declaration to abstain from
first use of weapons, and call for a war-free zone in Europe. But
experience shows such calls are totally inadequate.</p>

<p>The world has not been thrown into the horrors of all out nuclear,
chemical or biological war but not because of international
agreements. A major reason has been that even the most ruthless
ruling class calculate that a world devastated by plague or
permanently contaminated by chemical poisons would be of no economic advantage.</p>

<p>But how long can we rely on such a fragile &#8220;balance of terror&#8221;
to keep peace? The 25 million dead in small wars in the peacetime
years since 1945 are a reminder of how tenuous this cynical balancing is.</p>

<p>Socialists will find this book good on the nature and history of
the weapons, but less reliable on the cures.</p>

<p>Join the fight to get rid of capitalism worldwide, as the only way
to end the horrors of war. Use the facts in this book as ammunition.</p>
