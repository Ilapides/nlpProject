<h1>World&#8217;s worst industrial disaster</h1>

<br />
<p class="fst">THE comments of rescue workers in Bhopal, India, after the world&#8217;s
worst-ever industrial disaster tell their own horrific take:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Every house we entered was crammed with bodies. The
carnage was such that it appeared that a nuclear bomb had dropped
onto the city.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">Government sources tentatively claim that 2,000 people were
killed, 20,000 injured and 200,000 affected by a deadly cocktail of
cyanide and phosgene gases, released after storage tanks at a
pesticide plant exploded and turned much of the city into one vast
gas chamber.</p>

<p>The pesticide company &#8211; the giant US-owned Union Carbide &#8211;
sought to minimise the hazards by claiming that the gasses can be
neutralised by moisture in the air and that they pose no long-term
effects. But what is the truth? And more specifically, what is the
safety record of Union Carbide?</p>

<p>It has long been known that trace amounts of methyl isocyanate one
of the escaped gasses &#8211; causes voluminous emissions from the eyes
and irritation to the skin and internal organs. Long-term exposure to
infinitesimal quantities has been known to cause infertility amongst
women and cancer.</p>

<p>When inhaled in larger amounts it can produce a rapid accumulation
of fluid in the lungs &#8211; causing drowning. The gas can also remove
essential iron from the blood stream leading to malfunction of organs
and death.</p>

<p>It is precisely because of the stringent medical tests demanded by
the US Environmental Protection Agency that companies like Union
Carbide decide to operate in other countries. Once known as &#8216;public
enemy number 1&#8217;, by environmental groups, Union Carbide have
established a notorious record of health and safety nationally and
internationally. It once held the dubious distinction in the 1960s of
operating the &#8216;smokiest factory in the world&#8217; in its &#8216;Ever
Ready&#8217; battery factory in Virginia.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Third World victims</h4>

<p class="fst">Another factory in Indonesia was found to be emitting huge
concentrations of carbon black, contaminated with poisonous mercury.
Of the 750 workforce a staggering 402 employees were found to be
suffering from some kind of kidney disease.</p>

<p>But it has been their operations in the pesticide industry which
have produced the biggest controversy and also yielded massive
profits. The company, in recent years have exported to developing
countries huge amounts of pesticides and herbicides, which are banned
or severely restricted as a health hazard in the USA.</p>

<p>This is usually done in conjunction with new seed strains and
fertilizers as part of a &#8220;Green Revolution&#8221; package &#8211; thereby
creating a new cycle of dependency and debt. It is estimated that
normally 140 lbs of hazardous pesticides are exported to these
countries each year.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Capitalist priorities</h4>

<p class="fst">In 1980 Union Carbide sold in Latin America alone &#163;645 million
worth of pesticides making an operating profit of $122m. This is just
one of the 19 multinational corporations that dominate the market in
that region. Moreover, if their combined operations in other products
and industries are examined, then the health hazards are enormously magnified.</p>

<p>The callous behaviour of the monopolies can be demonstrated by
recent examples of a West German company dismantling its entire
asbestos textile factory near Hamburg and transferring it to a site
near Cape Town in South Africa. The Swiss Company CIBA-GEIGY was
forced to admit that it sprayed Egyptian children deliberately with
insecticide to test the children for toxic levels and to establish a
link with cancer.</p>

<p>The trade union movement of these countries must be satisfied that
the processes for the manufacture of chemicals are safe for workers,
for the surrounding community and for the environment as a whole.
Catastrophes like the one in Bhopal, environmental pollution and the
wholesale poisoning of communities are inevitable because of the
inherent drive by big business enterprises for maximum profits, where
operations and conditions are governed by the anarchy of the mark and
competition.</p>
