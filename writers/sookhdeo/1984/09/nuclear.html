<p class="fst">THE RECENT accident which resulted in the sinking of the French
freighter <em>Mont Louis</em> with its lethal cargo of material has
resurrected the fear of a major catastrophe. For it has been revealed
that the cargo consisted of a deadly mixture of enriched uranium and
some 450 tonnes uranium hexafluoride &#8211; Hex. Hex, a vital component
of the nuclear power and weapon programme is extremely corrosive.
Even more disturbing, it produces a violent explosion on contact with
water with the release of harmful radiation.</p>

<p>Both substances can poison the sea and air for thousands of years
with disastrous consequences. And the accident itself raises more
serious and important questions. The French authorities refused at
first to comment on the accident and then when forced to only
released partial information. They subsequently admitted that the
ship was also carrying enriched uranium which posed a hazard.</p>

<p>More importantly, however, is the web of secrecy and the absence
of international safeguards surrounding the transportation of these
substances. Their importance is such, it is claimed that absolute
secrecy is necessary.</p>

<p>The ship owners thought it appropriate to list their cargo as
&#8220;medical supplies&#8221;. The crew were only aware they were carrying
radioactive substances because they were issued with Geiger counters.
The only international safeguards that exists lay in the
specification of &#8220;safe containers&#8221;.</p>

<p>Moreover, the accident has demonstrated that there are no
designated routes for nuclear carrying vessels. Indeed much atomic
wastes comes over from Holland on roll on/roll off container ships
alongside such shipments as cheese and chocolates. The ships are not
specially constructed to withstand collisions nor do they have
sophisticated navigational equipment, nor do they have their crews
hand picked for their skills as seamen.</p>

<p>The latest accident has once again cast a cloud over the nuclear
industry. The recent revelations of leakages of radiation into the
sea, the irrefutable evidence linking it with various forms of
cancers and the persistent threat of a catastrophe, now make it
imperative that the whole nature of the nuclear industry is questioned.</p>

<p>Where profit is the motive, accidents live. This is inevitable
unless a coherent energy programme is developed, which includes
nuclear fusion (not fission which produces radioactive waste) and
alternative forms of energy which do not produce harmful substances
that can endanger mankind.</p>
