<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">MANY COMPANIES, notably in asbestos, have already moved onto the
offensive by challenging the research evidence to date and
substituting their own.</p>

<p>The much publicised cases involving the herbicide 245T, asbestos,
lead, and radiation highlights the absurd inadequacy of present
legislation. Regulations and procedures, which are really required to
test and regulate dangerous processes and products, are subordinated
to the narrow commercial interests of the chemical companies.</p>

<p>A company has the right, for instance, to withhold, even from the
government, vital scientific and medical information on the grounds
that it may be of &#8216;commercial importance&#8217;.</p>

<p>This &#8216;let-out&#8217; clause, is intended to safeguard profitability.
Yet it can always be invoked to avoid revealing information which
would be crucial for assessing the risk a substance poses to the
health of the workforce or the population at large.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Chemicals</h4>

<p class="fst">Chemical companies can also use ambiguous legislation to avoid
paying compensation for injuries caused by toxic chemicals. The
Factories Act requires companies to notify the Health and Safety
Executive about the prevalence of occupational disease amongst their workforce.</p>

<p>Using the criteria demanded from the HSE, companies have so far
only classified 18 diseases as attributable to toxic materials and as
such liable for compensation. Most diseases not known to be caused by
carcinogenic (cancer-causing) substances are simply referred to as
ulceration or poisoning.</p>

<p>The term cancer is never used in respect to any of these
substances. Asbestosis is not even classed as an occupational
disease. Also, if a company manufactures less than one ton of
chemical a year, it is under no obligation to perform the necessary
screening tests for toxicity before manufacturing the product.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>245T &#8216;cleared&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">On this basis, 245T, used as a defoliant in Vietnam and known to
cause genetic deformation, has been given a clean bill of health!
Although trade unions have called for it to be banned, 245T is still
used as a herbicide in Britain.</p>

<p>Indeed, under the 1976 Health and Safety at Work Act, only new
chemicals need to be tested. And it is not mandatory to carry out all
the toxicological tests, especially the more long and expensive
tests, derived from animal experiments!</p>

<p>The same anomalous situation exists regarding the recognition of
drugs and chemicals by the internationally agreed system of naming
and labelling. This would be an important development as it would
facilitate the early recognition of symptoms and prevention.</p>
<p>Chemicals are still openly sold under a variety of trade names,
codes and even numbers. This makes them unidentifiable even to
scientists and doubly so for a trade union representative seeking
information about it.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Threshold</h4>

<p class="fst">Even more controversial is the use of the so-called threshold on
&#8216;safe&#8217; levels of harmful substances in the workplace. These
levels have been the target of enormous criticism by the trade union
because they are based on an &#8216;average healthy male, working eight
hours a day under sterile conditions&#8217;! The unions claim that in
addition the levels are not standard internationally, are assessed on
very little information, improperly derived and only relate to
certain organs in the body.</p>

<p>All available evidence suggests there is no safe level of
exposure. Since cancer and other diseases tend to develop very
slowly, the effects of a toxic chemical cannot be known until it is
too late.</p>

<p>The only way to avoid long term poisoning is for the labour and
trade union movement to initiate a campaign. Such a campaign must
immediately outlaw asbestos, lead in petrol and 245T.</p>

<p>The campaign must demand the full revelation of all results of all
relevant tests, whether from the government or company sources,
together with a thorough medical examination of all workers who have
worked with hazardous chemicals. Trade unions must insist that
comprehensive medical records are kept and made available to the
public.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Essential?</h4>

<p class="fst">The dangers of toxic substances pose more fundamental questions.
The labour movement must challenge the bug business myth that these
substances are crucial for the continued development of society. They
claim for instance that herbicides and pesticides, known to cause
genetic deformities, are essential to provide the food we need. But
there are potentially many more effective methods that could be used
&#8211; with much less harmful results to the environment and the
consumers &#8211; such as the planned rotation of crops, growing on
smaller areas and the planned management of insect populations.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Safety checks</h4>

<p class="fst">The horrendous effects now emerging about certain chemicals, make
it imperative that safety checks be introduced long before chemicals
reach the production stage. The trade union movement must be
satisfied on safety before production is started. They should also be
satisfied that the processes for the manufacture of the chemicals are
also safe for the workers immediately involved and the surrounding
community and environment.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Contradiction</h4>

<p class="fst">There will always be a fundamental contradiction in capitalist
society between the development of science and technology, which
demands a rational and rounded out approach, and application of the
results of science by business enterprises. Their primary concern is
to maximise their profits. At every stage their operations are
conditioned by the anarchy of the market and competition with their rivals.</p>

<p>If anyone doubts the attitude of the chemical companies then look
at their record in the Third World. There they continue to use drugs
which have been banned in the West.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>3rd World</h4>

<p class="fst">They have dumped anabolic steroids in countries such as Bangladesh
to overcome stunting in children, when &#8220;all&#8221; that is needed is
proper nutrition. In Paraguay and Tunisia they have distributed
millions of contraceptives banned in the USA.</p>

<p>Even more horrendous is the use of children in Egypt to test the
effect of pesticides. They just assemble the children in fields
whilst an aircraft circles overhead spraying them with chemicals. Can
anyone seriously doubt how imperative it is that science and
technology are taken out of the hands of such capitalist gangsters
and run for the benefit of all.</p>
